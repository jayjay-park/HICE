Because youre only a few days in dont be surprised if it takes a while to get your medication right. It took three years for me to get completely stable then I got my drivers licence back.Also dont ever feel youre defective because youre not. Im not sure about anyone else here but when it first happened to me I thought everyone would now look at me as if I was so I didnt tell anyone and internalized a lot frustration which was completely unnecessary.

99722,0,t3_1v5pn3,I interviewed for grad school with the guy who developed keppra and tested it in rats.  Keppra was associated with folic acid deficiencies in the brain.  There were also B vitamin deficiencies including B.  I had those same side effects until starting Deplin which is a folate supplement that is better suited to crossing the blood brain barrier.  Your lethargy is a real scientifically documented side effect.  There havent been any  to my knowledge  human studies concerning keppra and the supplements which is why they are not normally prescribed.  I took the publications to my neurologist and asked for the prescription.  Since its harmless he gave it a shot.  Deplin is normally prescribed for major depressive disorder so he had to tag on an extra diagnosis before my insurance would cover it.  Its not expensive anyway but every penny counts.  I get the headaches too but I have no evidence either way to connect them to skipping your supplements.  All I can say is if it works and its safe then keep doing it.  Buy two months supply and then youll have a buffer between needing your supplements and getting them from the market.,Epilepsy,ceps833,2,t5_2s1h9

607322,0,t3_20znf6,I ignored symptoms like that for up to a year.  Prior to my first grand mal it was just a really bad feeling and like I was on a different plane in my brain.  A neuro actually said the grand mal was just a  time thing even though I told him about the previous episodes.  After the nd major one both were preceded by an aura I saw a couple other doctors including an epileptologist who thinks its temporal lobe epilepsy. I still get the auras  or  times a month usually in the morning on the weekends when Ive slept longer than usual but occasionally at other random times too.  Theyre different now though and are usually followed by a confusion and a memory gap.

They can be controlled but it can take time and a lot of different medicines you will have to take until you personally find what works with your body chemistry.  There can be triggers but it took me awhile to realize mt triggers.

1267008,0,t3_28j1v0,Hi I feel your pain. You sound a lot like me circa last summer! I was having what I thought were panic attacks deja vu feeling like my legs were crossed all my sense were messed up etc and I actually ended up seeing a psychologist for them. After a few months he told me he didnt think they were psychological due to the fact that the panic attack physical part like anxiety and racing heart and adrenaline actually went away after awhile but Id still have the episodes of deja vu and mixed senses. He sent me to my PCP who sent me in for an MRI while I had to wait a couple weeks to see a neuro. She found a lesion on my brain that ended up being a birth defect cortical dysplasia and here I am a year later on the road to recovery. Its a slow process but what can you do.NOW. Dont let that freak you out. That was just my experience. My advice is to talk to your PCP first. I actually didnt know how to explain it to my doctor until I came across a reddit post about someone whos family member was experiencing simple partial seizures...and thats how I was able to explain how I felt. Use all the words that come to mind. Your PCP will know what to do and that route might be MRI gt neurologist gt epileptologist or you might be given something small for anxiety. Stress and anxiety can do some crazy shit to you even when you feel like its not that big of a deal. Just listen to your body. When it comes down to feeling guilty dont. Thats something you just have to push aside and you can even tell your PCP that you feel that way. When something weird happens to us again we just need to listen to our bodies. What youre describing does sound similar to me although some differences. Your PCP will refer you to a neuro and all you do is tell them the exact same thing. Good luck.,Epilepsy,cic5kmx,2,t5_2s1h9

Here are the things you need to watch out forSleep stress alcohol.Im assuming you are about  you should be getting about  hours of sleep every night at this age this can be tough with school. Try to make your schedule consistent so you can wake up at regular hours or just try to avoid morning classes.Stress Unlike sleep you wont have total control over this however you are aware of the amount of stress you are currently under and during these periods make sure you get that sleep. Remember this is your health your talking about try not to worry so hard if your GPA isnt a ..Alcohol yeah. Your gonna enter college and wherever you go alcohol will be all over the place. Here is my advice Dont touch it. While it wont necessarily effect your condition immediately it can effect you later in the week. This is harder said then done well because college and parties and friends and drinking and whatnot. So dont back out of social events but drink really damn slow. Hell pretend to sip Id often pretend to go to the bathroom and pour a ton of my cup down the drain. Most epileptics wont consume over  alcoholic beverages in a night. Other than that my biggest tip would be find friends who fit INTO this lifestyle. Friends who pressure you to drink and go out to another party will make your life more difficult. I struggled a bit through college until my senior year where my new group of friends were more supportive. Dont be dragged into situations where you have to worry about epilepsy.As a recent graduate I hope this helps you. Enjoy college D,Epilepsy,cjgbfrr,3,t5_2s1h9

That test really is designed to mess with your head but knowing before hand takes a little bit of the edge off of it.

How are you supposed to get your MBA with these grades? As we all know these medications come with harsh psychological side effects. As a teenager your mind is already kind of fucked up and with these medications it was getting darker. In addition to that my parents were constantly on top of me because they were throwing money away my medicines were always changing I was always sleeping and I started hanging out with the wrong people. I became suicidal but no one really cared. The school stepped in once I slipped up at school and told a student a plan I had. My dad is still a neurologist Im still an epileptic and at  more confused than ever with what to do with my life. I talked to my epileptologist the guy who has been the most stable relationship throughout my entire life and he said not to worry. Ive been through a lot and things will work out for me in the end.

He suggested I slowly ween myself off the medication over a period of  weeks. So today I am  and no longer on any medication and have been absence free since I came off it with no side effects.

I think bystanders should stand back and call  if they dont know what to do so people dont try to help and make things worse like the swallowing your tongue thing. Otherwise they should roll the person on their side and put something soft under their head. Typical medical advice. The problem is with public seizures someone will almost always call  even if you dont injure yourself because thats the natural thing to do. Some people feel more comfortable with this but those who have many seizures dont always want an ambulance bill every time. So not sure what you should say about that.

3179271,0,t1_copxmo9, Just take one small inhale. If you dont smoke and dont have tolerance thats all you need. Something cold to drink couch and TV. Dont be in public or at a friends house. Be at home. If you get paranoid you can always curl up with a blanket and take a nap. Dont do dabs dont vaporize it. Its to strong.  If it has purple hairs on it its just gonna put you to sleep. If it has a lot of red hairs its a Sativa strain most likely. If you smoke to much your going to get paranoid and it will be terrible. My personal opinion is the bud that is all green must be the medical stuff because it does not get me high at all.  The two main reasons I hear people say they did not like smoking marijuana and dont smoke it are it just made me sleepy and it just made me paranoid. If you live somewhere its legal I would just ask someone at the store to help you. Just tell them you have never smoke before. Im sure they get that all the time. Dont let anyone pressure you.  ,Epilepsy,corj32w,1,t5_2s1h9
3212299,0,t1_couy07i,Topamax is used as a mood stabilizer in psychiatry. My guess is the neuro is going to balance the mood issues with it. Ive taken christ Ive lost count how many psych drugs combined with seizure meds painkillers the list of prescription drugs that has passed my lips has got to be more than  something in  years. If someone hasnt found the right meds yet keep trying. It took me  years to finally get my psych issues and epilepsy properly controlled. The average for getting psych meds finally right is a decade. Remember that just because you or Mike of Fred or Jeff or Sarah or that guy who lived down the street or that stranger you ran your cart into in the produce isle had a bad or good reaction to something doesnt mean its going to be the same for Jack or Rodger or the garbage man or grandma.I refuse to tell other psych patients what drugs dont work for me because so many will then refuse meds their doctor tries to prescribe.

I did not really do to much research but I found this Inherited long QT syndrome At least  genes associated with long QT syndrome have been discovered so far and hundreds of mutations within these genes have been identified. Mutations in three of these genes account for about  to  percent of long QT syndrome cases. Doctors have described two forms of inherited long QT syndromeRomanoWard syndrome. This more common form occurs in people who inherit only a single genetic variant from one of their parents.Jervell and LangeNielsen syndrome. Signs and symptoms of this rare form usually occur earlier and are more severe than in RomanoWard syndrome. Its seen in children who are born deaf and have long QT syndrome because they inherited genetic variants from each parent.Additionally scientists have been investigating a possible link between SIDS and long QT syndrome and have discovered that about  percent of babies with SIDS had a genetic defect or mutation for long QT syndrome.

On the very last day I took my medicine I had a seizure so I was immediately put back on and at mg this time. My opinion is that unless you cant afford it or the side effects are to much for you is to just stay on it.

5270644,0,t3_3n47nf,TL DR Write down all your concerns and bring them with you to the Neuro.  Youll be more likely to bring things up if you write them down.Ive only had three grand mal seizures.  The first I was  It didnt just abruptly stop because I got treatment and I went on medication or something either.  I believe that seizure was brought on by very low blood sugar due to severe anorexia at the time I weighed a little over  pounds.  I also almost had and did have  grand mal a lot of seizures in detox I spent almost  weeks in detox Id rather quit heroin apparently I had like the biggest Xanax habit my rehab had ever seen  mgday   pounds all the while drinking so booze that I also had to have phenobarbital detox so I wouldnt get the DTs.  To this day I still cant believe that everyone I knew thought I was just fine.  I had to tell them when all four of my dealers ran out in part because I also sold on the side to pay for my habit.  I no longer had a choice it was that our possibly have a seizure bad enough to die from.  I checked myself in through the ER that night after I told my dad about it that afternoon.  It was a Friday too the rehab guy advisor tried to convince me to come in on Monday lol.I do have absence seizures though I dont know how long I had them and didnt know it.  I had a really bad car accident when I was  and had a severe traumatic brain injury.  Its possibly I had them before then.  Am absence seizure definitely could have caused my accident.   Ill never know because the accident itself and the prior two years of my live are missing from my memory altogether and a lot of other things a lot of my childhood for one.I was diagnosed as bipolar when I was fourteen with a side order of generalized anxiety disorder and ADHD later I would develop  PTSD but thats not pertinent to the point Im trying to make.  Its possible that the brain dysfunction might be linked in a certain subset of people making them more prone to mental illness.  Im thankful for Lamictal because it also treats treats bipolar disorder so it was a doubly whammy and Topamax for treating migraines and also seizures thanks to the two of them the absence seizures have gone away to the point where they just dont happen anymore to any significant degree neither I or anyone else has noticed any.   Its a miracle I didnt constantly run into stuff in my car before I figured out what was going on I must have awesome autopilot.So theres that.  If you work  hours a week your body is probably tired.  If youre stressed youre putting more stress everywhere on your entire system.  Between the two youre literally over taxing your entire system.  Its no wonder things feel our if whack.  The meds dont necessarily help either a lot of them do make you feel foggy or like a blunt instrument or emotionally numb our whatever but isnt it better than having seizures?  You might need a different med our a dosage adjustment.  Write down all your concerns and bring them with you to the Neuro.

5555244,0,t3_3r581e,First of all hes got to see a good neurologist who specializes in epilepsy andor a hospital with a dedicated Epilepsy Department.  It can make a big difference in the quality of care as compared to just seeing a regular neurologist.  Hes got to take medications regularly side effects or not.  Theres over  meds available today so if one doesnt work or has bad side effects he needs to contact his doctor and try another. As far as drinking he sounds like me at  Im  now.  At  I still went out a great deal still partied plenty.  Most of the time I got away with it...but I had seizures too and some were serious.  No doubt the beer made them more likely.  I remember collapsing while eating breakfast in a favorite greasy spoon restaurant on New Years Day after a wild time the night before.  Its hard to know what his real limit will be until hes getting proper medical care and taking his medications.  Medications are a life adjustment they do have side effects but they do not end your life.  I finished law school with honors at a top school while on medication and I was age  at graduation  so it is possible for life to go on.  With treatment Im able to have  beers and be OK.  Without medication...disasters occur and alcohol only makes them more likely. Lastly for many cases of epilepsy the cause is never determined even with extensive testing.

I just had the RNS put in and I had a seizure that very night in the hospital.  Apparently threw my dinner plate on the floor something I normally would never do during a seizure and no memory of it.  My surgery isnt even in the same ballpark as yours...so just give it time.

They are by far the most efficient and longlasting.  I use two watt equivalents in my living room.  They use . watts each.  About the same as an old fashioned nightlight!  The estimated life according to the box is  years too.  So they are expensive up front but not in the long term.   There is no flicker with these and they are dimmable.

5859048,0,t1_cxjwl1v,They are contraindicated for people who have absence seizures already but that does not mean they will provoke absence seizures in people who have other types of seizures. If you were diagnosed with TLE Im guessing youve had simple partialcomplex partialmaybe tonic clonic seizures yes? Have you ever had one of your classic seizures captured on an EEG? If youve never had absence seizures before those drugs are not contraindicated for you and your doctor wouldnt mention that little tidbit since it might just make you worry needlessly as I may have done sorry.If your original diagnosis is correct Id say its pretty unlikely that your symptoms are a result of absence seizures and brief complex partials or medication side effects would be far more probable. Honestly though the person best suited to address your concerns is your neurologist and an EEG should be really helpful in clearing things up especially if youre spacing out frequently.,Epilepsy,cxnnf3d,1,t5_2s1h9

5958950,0,t3_3wcce8,hmm  sounds like youre having simple partial seizures. Theyre generally the wackyexperience sort of seizures when I was a kid I often got them when I ran and took a nap after getting into a frustrating argument with a family member. They were more vivid when I was younger but all of em tend to carry that sense of an option Either go deeper or pull out.The way I see it is When youre given that option of going deeper into the seizure you can slowly lower yourself through it experience all that comprises the essence of the seizure ie why its happening and if you do it slowly enough then you feel OK afterwards. If you SLIP though it takes control of you and then things get worse.Its hard to say whether its better to go down that path or say get on meds and avoid that experience at all costs. In the right mindset seizures CAN make you feel better but  of the time this is not the case.  of the time having ANY kind of seizure results in more seizures and those seizures are likely going to be more intense and managing the tranquil state of mind necessary to maintain control becomes more and more difficult.Like everyone else has said though Go to a neurologist. Get a sleep study if possible try to get one when you know youll have a seizure. Theyll know whats up.edit pictures included to help emphasize a little.,Epilepsy,cy0qzb5,3,t5_2s1h9

Just a simple blood test will pick up many problems in an early stage before anything serious or irreversible occurs.  From what I know it is not a  final answer but will catch a lot of problems if they should occur.

Seizures cant cause the lights at your desk to flicker.

The flicker you see is not actually occurring.  It is simply your own brains altered perception when a seizure comes.

I broke a tooth because of that. They all thought I was Dying! Now they know what to do but I havent had a seizure since April and I dont actually know if theyll do the right thing since they panic a lot. I fear they will still try to put something in my mouth again even though they now know that they are not supposed to. That makes me wonder about what I look like during my seizures.

9345599,0,t3_58hzka,Your friend needs to be educated the term handicapped isnt used anymore its offensive and outdated... See Here Epilepsy is not a disease... it is classified as a neurological disorder... marked by sudden recurrent episodes of sensory disturbance loss of consciousness or convulsions associated with abnormal electrical activity in the brain. To answer your question is epilepsy a disability? Let me start by saying... the term disability is often used to describe an ongoing physical challenge. This could be a bump in life that can be well managed or a mountain that creates serious changes and loss. Either way this term should not be used to describe a person as weaker or lesser than anyone else! Every person has a purpose special uniqueness and value no matter what hurdles they may face.In addition just because a person has a disability does not mean they are disabled. Many living with these challenges are still fully active in their work families sports or hobbies. Some with disabilities are able to work full or part time but struggle to get through their day with little or no energy for other things. Others are unable to maintain gainful or substantial employment due to their disability have trouble with daily living activities andor need assistance with their care.Unfortunately people often judge others by what they see and often conclude a person can or cannot do something by the way they look. This can be equally frustrating for those who may appear unable but are perfectly capable as well as those who appear able but are not.International Disability expert Joni Eareckson Tada explained it well when she told someone living with debilitating fatigue People have such high expectations of folks like you with invisible disabilities like come on get your act together. but they have such low expectations of folks like me in wheelchairs as though its expected that we cant do much Joni.The bottom line is that everyone with a disability is different with varying challenges and needs as well as abilities and attributes.  Thus we all should learn to listen with our ears instead of judging with our eyes. Referenced,Epilepsy,d90me5l,3,t5_2s1h9
9407232,0,t1_d97ds4e,This is a tough question but I think it still comes down to the same answer.  There are people children too who have seizures several times a day and black out for some.  Maybe even need to carry emergency meds with them.  At the same time theres people who only get myoclonics and remain fully aware and able to learn.I dont think a safety device prevents stigma.  Most safety devices simply give you a warning that a seizure is likely to happen soon.  If one happens safety device or not opportunity is there for the stigma.  What we really need is better seizure prevention.  Medications with fewer side effects and electronic implant devices that arent visible and have no side effects such as the RNS but keep improving the device.  The will be a scar on a persons head but at least in a child it is going to be covered by hair.  No one will know anything except for the fact the person has fewer seizures.I dont know maybe Ive been lucky but Ive never had much stigma as a result of epilepsy.  Part of that is due to the fact seizures didnt start until age .  All I can say is I dated married became a father and earned a graduate degree with honors all after seizures started.  Plenty of perfectly healthy people dont get this far.  My epilepsy is not genetic so I was not worried about having a child.  ,Epilepsy,d98fl2w,1,t5_2s1h9

Its just invalidation.Talking to others with epilepsy e.g. here or in person might help you feel validated.Its well known that seizures cause more seizures. Be nice to yourself and take your meds. You have to advocate for yourself with any medical condition but especially a neurological one.,Epilepsy,dd10thg,12,t5_2s1h9

I know what opiate withdrawal feels like but Im really scared of what withdrawal from anticonvulsants is like. I know my brain has changed since I started them.

11178817,0,t3_5zk5mc,Her big seizures sound like the typical grand mal medically termed tonicclonic seizures. The awful sound is caused by the air being forced through the vocal chords when muscles tighten. You are correct in learning first aid and learn rescue breathing techniques like CPR without compression for ifwhen she turns blue. Her other episodes sound like partial seizures. There are many kinds and they vary widely. As for the fear thats entirely a personal issue and everyone struggles. She should not be driving and be careful cooking and bathing or operating any machinery. The best thing is to do lots of research feel free to ask lots of questions here. Talk to your neurologist and get her started on meds but it might take awhile to find something that helps. Chin up and best wishes were here for you! ,Epilepsy,dez3u93,2,t5_2s1h9

11235305,0,t1_df5f9nz,Before everything went downhill for me I had issues with constipation. I had a particularly nasty stomach bug which seemed to switch everything around. The unintended weight loss started with diarrhea stomach pains and a nausea that was intense and deeply seated in my throat. Sometimes even the thought of food would make me want to double over. Certain food smells made me nauseous enough to vomit. I was never pregnant which was always the first question everyone asked. I thought I was developing food allergies and the constant nausea became only occasional once I went gluten free. Also my cystic acne stopped in its tracks. Im still amazed. However I started having other psychological issues when the nausea went down so I dont know what really happened there.,Epilepsy,df5i8j7,1,t5_2s1h9

11295720,0,t3_6162rn,Im guessing youve never had an overnight sleep study that included an EEG with video telemetry? The goal here is to produce a seizure often more than one. The way they go about that with me is  days before testing I purposely begin depriving myself of sleep followed by a reduction in medications  days prior to testing. Doctors gather a plethora of information about type and origin of seizures when they have video documentation accompanied by real time testing of brain activity. ,Epilepsy,dfccqen,1,t5_2s1h9

Also grab a boatload of Gatorade.  It sounds silly but it can help especially you have something related to an electrolyte issue.  Gatorade is an epileptics best friend,Epilepsy,dfhqna1,1,t5_2s1h9

11413254,0,t3_62wvqh,Lack of sleep is my main trigger so if it happens I usually wait a good amount after I take my morning meds  which for me is around am but I guess it would depend on your schedule and I also have had all of my seizures almost like clockwork around  am so I try to not be very active during those times. so a number of factors really. anyone who has epilepsy has different abilities to handle lack of sleep differently of courseMainly I tell people who know my condition and are going to be around me that Im in a situation where a seizure could likely happen and I make sure someone knows when Im going to shower be by myself  walking to work etc. I drink a lot of water have something to eat and avoid any coffee or caffeine.

When it does happen I can just collect my blankets and sheets up and toss them right together in the wash and my mattress stays spotless. I also use a product called Odoban goes in with the fabric softener which is great at keeping my sheets smelling fresh even after being soiled on. Good luck!,Epilepsy,dg4kmr4,5,t5_2s1h9
