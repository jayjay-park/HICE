1936306,0,t3_2gtp8n,Hey Im new to reddit and just found this subreddit. Just wanted to mention I have experienced the same as you and I have some advice.Ive been training for about  years and Im now in my mids and bigger and stronger than Ive ever been. Whenever I stop training for more than even two weeks I rapidly drop muscle basically multiple pounds per day until I start training again. My most recent break was for about  weeks of overseas work in the late spring and I went from a muscular lbs at around  body fat to around lbs and a slight increase in body fat.  Ive experienced this kind of weight loss many times over the course of my training years and want to tell you not to worry. Youll find that your lean mass comes back extremely quickly once you get back on your bodybuilding diet and training regimen. It took me about  weeks to get back to about  I think and now about  months later Im up around lb. It seems to be the case and Ive heard this from others that once your muscles have reached a certain size its much easier to get them back to that size than growing them for the first time. Now in your case with the herniated disc risk... it brings back some intensely painful memories. Be Careful man. Get back into your training slowly and carefully and really focus on safely strengthening your lower back lots of hyperextensions etc. Dont risk reinjuring it by training heavy too soon and especially not with any compression movements. Take a few months of recovery training. You can still do plenty of noncompression movements pull ups and weighted dips etc. For trap training deadlifts have always worked best for me and thats out of the question for you. The problem with traps is you have to train them heavy and its a compressive force on your spine which you simply shouldnt do any time soon. The best solution might be seated dumbbell shrugs but even getting those weights to the bench is risky for you with a healing disc. If you decide to shrug from a bench use LIGHT WEIGHTS and just up your reps to get to failure even if it means getting to  reps.  Id lay off overhead pressing and focus on noncompressive movements for a few months to be safe. You DO NOT want future back issues because you really mess it up again while its healing. Dont mess with the back!!Its now been a couple years since my severe disc injury two discs fully extruded and impinging the s nerve and Im back to heavy squats and deadlifts and have had no back issues at all. In fact Im stronger than Ive ever been now and it might even be due in part to my months of attention on strengthening my lower back and core safely mostly without weights at all after my injury.  I still have my plan from my recovery will post if you want it. The chances of reinjuring a disc in the first year of recovery are super high you see this in pro sports all the time. Dont let it happen again and youll be in great shape a year from now and maybe take this time to really bullet proof your lower back and core while you heal.,naturalbodybuilding,ckmijo0,6,t5_2vx10
1941277,0,t3_2gw1nn,I dont follow IIFYM. I stick to mostly unprocessed high BV protein and low GI carbs and a mix of saturatedpolymono fats.Ive learnt from personal experience that macros change alot with perhaps the only thing you absolutely must have minimum being a baseline of protein g per pound any other cals can come from carbs or fat but I perfer carbs filler fills you up on cut or bulk.Current macros prob something like pcf. Bulking  months inJust been adding additional carbs in for additional calories when my weight gain has stalled.I think people should shoot for the best health outcome  that also means not just attaining a good caloric surplus but also avoiding excessive sodium sugars and other things. For example I believe my last cutting diet only had like g of sugar a day thats less than a small serving of coke. Also fiber is prob the factor that is LEAST paid attention to and if people DID use it properly their cutting periods wouldnt feel like a period of starvation and their bulks would be alot more controlled as they would be full and not going overboard with dirty bulks. Another controversial opinion I have is that there is virtually no role for convenience supplements most applicable to whey protein. I think people should be able to just get their macro needs from food alone ideally from superfoods I love a variety of beans.Huge advocate for fiber g on low days g on high.,naturalbodybuilding,ckn4cwb,1,t5_2vx10

4288783,0,t1_cs90d8y,Im not talking about the post workout window. Im saying that there is no difference between ingesting g of protein and g of protein in a meal and that MPS can at the minimum be stimulated every  hours less than that and it will get desensitized basically and more than  hours gets to its lowest point so if you are consuming protein every  hours you will keep MPS stimulated optimally. Also what turns on the MPS pathway is leucine I want to say like .g but dont quote me on that so you only really need enough g of protein to contain that amount of leucine but on average across many different protein sources its g. Hence my recommendation to consume g of protein every  hours which is not necessary for fat loss by any means but is a good way to help reserve muscle mass on a cut and good practice for how to structure meals when on a bulk regardless. ,naturalbodybuilding,cs92fh0,3,t5_2vx10

4604832,0,t1_ctb0ja1,I say keep what you are doing for chest just use DB for the pec fly instead  or if you can set up a bench by some cables for the fly movement.Rear delts you gotta watch this vid and I do both arms in a reverse fly motion with cables this is my go to movement and I usually do  sets. You could also do bent over flys but I dont like them. Another is where you lay sideways on a bench have your elbow at  and move a DB from in front of you to your side. This works more of the shoulder girdle and rotator cuffs so it is more of a preventative  rehab exercise than a strength size i.e. it allows you to bench more with less chance of failure.I should also say I dont do BB shoulder press because my frontal head gets enough work with my upper chest routine and my medial head gets a lot of work with the DB shoulder press I do  sets of that and lateral raises.,naturalbodybuilding,ctb0wrq,1,t5_2vx10

I wanted to be in a huge deficit. I didnt understand counting burned calories but I know how many calories I was consuming. I also mowed my grandmothers yard at her farm twice a week. With a push mowerexercising so I was really burning a lot more than I thought and fucking my body up. Also I was prescribed adderall at the time. Try eating when you first take adderall. Some days I would just eat a bowl of cereal and that was it. Id take sleeping meds before the effects wore off and repeat everyday. As I said though. I know how many calories I was consuming. I knew how to count those calories. As for calories burned etc I didnt know how to count. Im  now. Ive been lifting for a long time and have more experience than yr old me.

Just to note  all of this was for natural competitors not assisted.Their approach in very brief terms is to drop overall volume at the start of a prep and at this point start a new block of periodisation that then builds volume throughout the prep. The idea being in later stages of your prep your volume reaches or in some cases can exceed the volume you were on at the end of the offseason.Theres quite a bit more too it but Im short on time!

I dont know what your programming is like your training age etc. so its tough to give you an accurate answer. But is it possible that you are working in the lower rep ranges getting stronger and then lifting more weight when you actually do delve into the  rep sets? Because that very well could be the case as it is for many people.Another thing I wanted to mention is that both low reps and high reps have great potential to induce muscle hypertrophy given that volume is equated.

9555068,0,t3_5br8t5,The real answer is it doesnt particularly matter. Bro split is fine. PPL is fine and certainly not only or even especially for beginners. PHAT and PHUL are good. It depends on how much time and how many days you have to lift wheat you like doing and how well you can recover. If you want to do  days do PHUL. If you want to do  days do PHAT. If you want to do  days do PPL. Or do a bro split tailored to your daysweek. There is some evidential support for x per week frequency but its very thin. I personally err on the side of credence in that regard and do x per week but the evidence does not as yet justify any confidence in its superiority. On the other hand the evidence pretty conclusively demonstrates that rep ranges within reasonable parameters are interchangeable for hypertrophy. Further there seems to be some value to periodisation varying your weight lifted and therefore rep range. So with that in mind Id personally recommend PHAT or PHUL or if you want to do  days a week PPL do it with the first three days in a  type rep range for the main lifts and the latter three days in a  rep range approximately the specifics of this dont matter particularly just vary the rep ranges. Or if you like bro split lifting vary your rep ranges from week to week.If you werent making any gains on a bro split you werent eating or sleeping enough or your form was lacking. Bro splits are perfectly good for making gains at any level of lifting proficiency and experience. That said stick to the tips above and you should be good on the programming front.I can provide specific sources if youd like I just am too lazy too right now.

10287846,0,t1_dc9a6yr,gt One thing I have noticed has a significant impact on myself is if I miss a day or two of creatine. I definitely feel weaker without it.Ive never noticed creatine to do anything for me. Ive attempted it a few times for onetwo months at a time gained a few pounds in water weight from it very quickly but Ive never noticed any strength increases or enhanced energy from it.The last time I took it it made me wake up every night to take a piss. Even kept my water intake the same and then lowered it amp didnt drink water hrs before bed time used the bathroom before bed and still would wake up with a painful full bladder. At this point Ive just wondered if a lot of it is just hypeplacebo or if theres just something wrong with me. ,naturalbodybuilding,dca6m1o,2,t5_2vx10

11137831,0,t1_deucj5z,Eh I can mostly agree. Only a very select population will experience this. With experienced athletes gaining any LBM on a cut will simply not happen. Although being in a deficit is primarily used for fat loss and being in a surplus is primarily used to build muscle I suppose either can happen under any circumstance. Its still a more realistic outlook to simply view cutting as losing fat because it would be very inefficient to try and build muscle on a cut. Plus when youre lean enough then you will lose both muscle and fat when cutting. ,naturalbodybuilding,deugn1v,1,t5_2vx10

11283303,0,t1_dfavwgf,Yeah def wouldnt recommend that thats a pretty extreme form of IF... just keep it simple man. For skinny fat ppl it is hard but I for that I recommend bulking and then cutting or you can try eating at maintenance and recomping though that takes longer. Is your goal getting bigger or getting stronger? What is your age? I can try to estimate a better calorie goal for you. As to your original question there isnt really a limit to the amount of meat you can eat for general health purposes it is recommended to keep red meat lt ozwk but if you dont have an risk factors or family history of heart disease you can be a little less strict with that. Main thing I would recommend is get a variety of meat sources a week. I.e. Dont eat chicken with every meal. Good protein sources include fish tuna salmon tilapia etc poultry chickenturkey lean red meats low fatfat free dairy yogurt esp Greek milk cheese eggs soy products like tofu and lentils ,naturalbodybuilding,dfay1wa,2,t5_2vx10

11501061,0,t3_645t7f,Intermediate would tend to be about lb a month on squat lb on bench and probably lb on deadlift too.
