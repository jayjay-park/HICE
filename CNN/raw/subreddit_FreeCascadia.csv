10397932,0,t1_dcml6ve,Youre not being crass your being intentionally obtuse.  Did the thought cross your head that those folks are working towards better things same as you did but would like to see work conditions improve anyway?  That traditionally fast food jobs had been middle class jobs until the last few decades when companies decided that their bottom lines would be better if they stopped increasing wages to match inflation and instead just matched them to whatever the absolute minimum they could get away with?  That you arent paying the real cost of food because these jobs pay subpar wages?  And bro they are union busting everywhere.  Nurses unions are being busted skilled trade such as welders and construction workers unions are being busted teachers unions are being busted.  If you think this is just a low wage job problem you are dead wrong.  The power of a union is strength in numbers.   You as an individual have limited negotiating power when dealing with whatever company company you are trying to work for.  Without a union the company can and does dictate every term of your employment and those terms are almost universally skewed against you because their only incentive is to pay you as little as possible.  With a union suddenly your bargaining power is much much higher.  Know whats better?  When a company not only has to deal with the union they are contracted with but they have to deal with every other union around them when they screw up.  Supporting the unions around you means they will support you guess what they typically support you anyway even if youre nonunion  Even if your industry is not unionized having unions nearby helps drive your wages up because the company does not want a union in their shop.  You seem to only be interested with your bottom line there it is.  Strong unions create higher wages.  Its that simple.  As for taxes dont conflate issues.  Unions have nothing to do with how much tax you pay other lifting your wages into higher tax brackets.  ,FreeCascadia,dcmo781,1,t5_2vhig
