5001113,0,t1_cuot6du,Oh god dont even get me started. Ive been trying for an hour.     I have every perfect in the game except for that one and its only because of those triple VegetaPull parts. Ive tried touch controls alternating A and DPad even using different fingers but every time one of the three messes me up.    I havent messed up once on any other part of the song! Its justVegetaPull.,rhythmparadise,cuotl96,1,t5_39qm2
