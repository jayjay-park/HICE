They decline applications from awesome students all the time. But no university can take everyone who applies so apply to multiple places. Prestige does not matter at all. It just matters that you went to an accredited school and not some diploma mill at the bottom of the ocean. My experience after my Masters is that no one cares that I have one but I appreciate the knowledge that I have. The reason for this is that too many mediumtalent and mediumworkethic people get degrees to cover for their mediocrity.

You will all be interviewing for positions that with all due respect have plenty of individuals who would be very willing to VOLUNTEER for. Typically researchlab jobs pay like shit are very boring and do not lend anything useful to the student after they graduate. On the other hand you may be doing administrativesalescustomer service work for hospitals. These are roles that are better off filled by people with actual experience in those positions and wish to pursue administrative careers. Im not saying you shouldnt go for coop but note that a high rate of acceptance into the coop program means that there will be upwards of  people applying to the same position each time a job is posted on your coop site.

Its still a Bachelors degree they technically slot you into year  of undergrad but a fast tracked  year degree designed for people who already have a Bachelors in another discipline. They cut out all of the electives except for a few Bridging module courses I chose mathematics and drill you with st through  level comp sci courses in those  years.So to respond I think I got all of my partying and enjoyment out in my first degree maybe a bit too much hence why Im back at school.

The other which is the Confirmation test yields inconclusive results by looking for evidence that confirms the hypothesis eg. evidence of UFOs.Tommys belief in aliens would be based on the confirmation test which is not the proper way to test a hypothesis theorieshypotheses can only be disproven not proven so you side with Jimmy.,UBC,ciiuhub,1,t5_2qy2j
1339314,0,t1_cik7y37,Attempt twice  repeat once but yes calculus courses may be repeated twice.  I should have indeed added that for obvious reasons below.Some other exceptions are for required MATH courses in BASC programs since they are part of an accreditation requirement for the profession. This essentially generates permission to repeat until passed or until Applied Science asks a student to withdraw from the degree program. In practice any course required for a program must either be repeated until it is passed or the student must withdraw from the program. I regularly get requests from Faculties to let students repeat courses a third time. I am the Undergraduate Chair of Mathematics so I am giving you current practice rather than my opinion. In my experience most Faculties work with students to give them full opportunity to complete their degrees rather than apply rules without such consideration. Asking a student to leave UBC has big consequences and so is normally only done when the student is deemed to have no chance of success. ,UBC,cikaeb3,3,t5_2qy2j

1733646,0,t3_2e9cjb,You can still apply and get admitted into the Science program. But they will require you to take PHYS  which is a course that focuses the first two weeks on getting you caught up in highschool physics and then finishing the rest of the semester with actual first year material. This will give you credit equivalent to PHYS . Normally if you had taken physics in highschool you would not need to take PHYS  if you prefer to take CHEM and BIO courses. However if if you choose not to take physics in highschool you will be required to take PHYS  to fulfill your requirement.Id also like to say that I am also in CPSC and although physics is not required for the program it is assumed you know the very basics. BIO and CHEM do not really apply to CPSC but you will definitely see some relations between PHYS and CPSC although maybe not many.

My article series is very little original work but still months of research curating and editing that is necessary to make those who didnt see the original works aware of them.Obviously thats nothing without the original research and investigation but when there are countless new news outlets with lightly or unestablished pedigrees permeating social media and people increasingly getting their news from things like their friends FB shares or their favourite Twitter list curation is becoming a significant function of making news accessible to those who wouldnt otherwise see it.No problem with the criticism but that often requires reading and commenting on the substance of an article which is not what I have  seen from the majority of rUBCs response to articles from The Talon.,UBC,cmtiao7,-3,t5_2qy2j

Most of what I read on the talon sounds condescending for precisely this reason. The dumbing down of their ideas feels so disingenuous that when the articles move on to genuine appeals for dialogue and collective organization it just seems like so much lip service.Basically the talon should just embrace whatever political and theoretical paradigms theyre drawing onterminological complexities includedand let their audience become informed and critical readers for themselves instead of trying and failing to babby them along.,UBC,cmu5gio,1,t5_2qy2j

4264104,0,t3_39s54s,Comp eng here. Getting a first term is definitely the most difficult part of coop especially if youre in second year with a full course load. From personal experience and what Ive found out from asking other coops a typical track record to get a position is  applicationsinterviewsoffers. Your experience will definitely reduce those ratios. The most difficult part is balancing getting those applications out with the second year course load. My advice will be to care most about the interviewsoffer ratio because thats what you have the most control over. I say this because Ive gotten interviews from my generic template cover lettersresumes and didnt get interviews from packages I spent a lot of time on including videossource code from relevant projectswork experience. Sometimes you can just get unlucky turning applications into interviews.I flopped my first search since I was busy enough with class and I was trying for the very competitive summer term. Gave up after  applications  interviews. I took a lighter course load in first term of third year specifically to put more work into my search. Hauled ass and put out  applications did  interviews and finally got an offer by a small engineering design services company awesome employer. Decisive factor was getting support from a very helpful coordinator who I wont mention since... well Ive told enough ppl already and shes apparently really busy now. Hopefully you can work with a just as helpful coordinator since it really did help me out. Second search was a breeze honestly nothing more to worry about.Best of luck hope your efforts pay off.      ,UBC,cs6a6od,4,t5_2qy2j

4458131,0,t3_3bpr10,Im coming at University from a different background  age to most people hope my story helps.When I left school I never considered University as an option. In fact only about  or  people in my graduating year went on to higher education. From about  and into my late s I had no ambitions and partied a lot. If Id have gone go school during this time I would have done poorly. Frankly I wouldnt know what to study because I had no careerinterest in mind and no academic motivation. As I got to the end of my s Id worked many many jobs mostly office based and ultimately Id always grew dissatisfied with them because of the pay lack of promotion opportunities and lack of interest in the companyindustry. The truth is without an education my options were limited. On top of this I was sick of hanging out in the same bars and indeed the town I was born and raised in. I knew I had to radically change my life.I saved for a year and got a young persons Canadian visa Im from the UK and moved to Victoria and Ive never looked back. Now Im in my mid s and Ive matured I hope! a lot. The natural landscape of Canada has inspired a passion for the environment and my education. I have a long term partner and Im ready to start a family. These are the things that motivate me now I have good reason to study and do well. I also feel very fortunate to be at such a prestigious school and to have the opportunity to learn and improve myself among some of best in world.So what does all this mean for you? Let me assure you that at  its OK that you arent sure what you want to do with your your studies and ultimately your life. Its a gradual process and it changes over time. I think that from a young age its drilled into us that we are supposed to know what we want for a career and that if we dont then we will fail at life. For some people it is that way and thats great but its OK if it takes you longer to get there.Ive met many young students who are here because their parents want them to be or because their friends are here or because they just think they are supposed to go to school and these are not good reasons nor motivations to excel. The fact that your parents dont want you to leave and might disown you if you were to drop out is a sad position to be in and its a shame they view things way. However they are paying for you and you are putting yourself in a situation where you are still dependant on them and are allowing them to dictate your life for you.You dont have to go to school just to get a degree for work purposes. I mean there is merit in education for educations sake. Why not take classes that interest you and not worry about majors? Ultimately you should be here because you want to be here. If that isnt the case then you should go for something you want to do. For me its perspective and experiences that give me good reason and motivation to be here.

Central among these rights is the freedom within the law to pursue what seems to them as fruitful avenues of inquiry to teach and to learn unhindered by external or nonacademic constraints and to engage in full and unrestricted consideration of any opinion. This freedom extends not only to the regular members of the University but to all who are invited to participate in its forum. Suppression of this freedom whether by institutions of the state the officers of the University or the actions of private individuals would prevent the University from carrying out its primary functions. All members of the University must recognize this fundamental principle and must share responsibility for supporting safeguarding and preserving this central freedom. Behaviour that obstructs free and full discussion not only of ideas that are safe and accepted but of those which may be unpopular or even abhorrent vitally threatens the integrity of the Universitys forum.

7395175,0,t3_4glswt,You can get the study permit at the border either land or air as long as you have all the required documents in hand so immigrating is pretty straightforward. Its worth applying for the NEXUS program after youre in Canada because it makes going back and forth much easier.Doing taxes is slightly more complicated because you have to file in both countries. But there are plenty of tax prep businesses e.g. HampR Block that can handle filing for both countries at the same time. Student taxes are usually fairly simple though you may want to check if having your parents claim you as a dependent is beneficial or not.A degree from a Canadian university is functionally equivalent to one from a US university anywhere in the USA. Finding work in the US should be generally no different with a Canadian diploma than with an American one. The exceptions are in professional degrees like medicine and dentistry. Even so the education is mostly the same and its more a matter of different licensing. The only area that really stands out is law since the two countries obviously have different legal systems. But you could even aim for a crossborder legal career if you really wanted.You can stay in Canada after graduating to look for work and grad school is just another study permit. I believe school years can count as halftime towards permanent residency if you want to apply for citizenship.Culturally living in urban anglophone Canada is not much different from living in many urban parts of the United States. Day to day life in Vancouver is pretty much just like Seattle though public transportation is better here and people care much more about hockey Canucks than football Seahawks. The cost of living is a bit higher particularly with the Canadian dollar being fairly low lately.

Personally Id suggest dropping LING  and consider taking one of your first term courses in the summer if youd like to work or get involved in extracurriculars.

Trump has yet to take power and its just speculation at this point.Im concerned about Trumps implications on international free trade more than anything else. He appears to be set on entering America into another period of isolation.Im also concerned about US Capital flight given potential new restrictions on business hiring. Trump is heavy on the business rhetoric but the populist rhetoric counteracts through increased regulation of the US Financial system in terms of capital flight decreased regulation and oversight of the US Banking sector which reminder  caused the  financial crisis efforts to prevent capital flight limitations on foreign workers increased financial intelligence and a general allaround interventionist approach to stimulating the economy and the banking sector.There are small demonstrations here and there around Vancouver and UBC. Nothing significant. People are very preoccupied with Trumps right wing social stance that traditionally contradicts the ethos of urban Canadian views but this is just a drop in the pond compared to the other devastating efforts Trumps economic maneuvering could lead to.This isnt a particularly fruitful time to have US Assets and holdings unfortunately.,UBC,d9y1llq,12,t5_2qy2j

9716783,0,t1_daarynn,He makes a viable speculation but he doesnt explain how that will play out. A simple speculation is not intelligent anyone can speculate what will happen. The important part is whether the speculation is founded or unfounded. Im sure Dr. Peterson as a leading scholar of Authoritarianism has good reasons to believe how this legal change will lead to the restriction of free speech. Unfortunately it sounds like he resorts to fear mongering mostly in this debate instead of explaining how Bill C may cause Canada to develop into Oceania in  as he implied numerous times. Now as a result his argument appeals me less because the other side explains how this legislation will not be abused logically by analyzing how the system works. Logical explanations make me doubt Dr. Petersons projections but he doesnt address the doubts that I have because hes too busy criticizing PC movement and warning about the coming of free speechs death.I essentially see very little development from his previous arguments. Fear mongering is not a new strategy for himon campus rallies he tried to convince students that PC movement caused the surge of altright and this will backlash to socalled SJWs as altright takes over politics. I think for a more compelling argument he should have explained how this bill will eventually develop into other laws that restrict free speech in more detail.Thats why Im disappointed.

Yes there are trades but we also need nurses and scientists and other skilled workers who need degrees. Additionally people with learning disabilities and mental health issues face enormous barriers in the current system where their grades dont reflect their intelligence or ability outside of an academic environment. Is the person who can speak insightfully at length about a topic and demonstrates the skills necessary for a job any less qualified because they struggle to write? Grades often merely reflect ones ability to perform in the academic environment of tests and paper writing. Its a measure sure but its often a terrible one. Ive met seen complete incompetence from people with masters degrees and raw intelligence and ability from those who cant or dont want get through the grades gauntlet. What it really boils down to is do you think higher education should be attainable to everyone that wants it? Or is university is only about job training?

I also seem to recall that they made me fill out a form on the first day that required me to fill out my  grade in Japn  and that failing to accurately report my academic history  on that form would be treated as academic dishonesty. It seemed like standard fare for the department since I also had to sign a similar form in the Japn  course that I took with another instructor.UBC is a very bureaucratic institution and takes academic dishonesty very seriously.

The other guy is just lying about Farrells views.What Warren Farrell actually saidgtIf a man ignoring a womans verbal no is committing date rape then a woman who says no with her verbal language but yes with her body language is committing date fraud. And a woman who continues to be sexual even after she says no is committing date lying.gtDo women still do this? Two feminists found the answer is yes. Nearly  percent of college women acknowledged they had said no to sex even when they meant yes. In my own work with over  men and women  about half of whom are single  the answer is also yes. Almost all single women acknowledge they have agreed to go back to a guys place just to talk but were nevertheless responsive to his first kiss. Almost all acknowledge theyve recently said something like Thats far enough for now even as her lips are still kissing and her tongue is still touching his.gtWe have forgotten that before we called this date rape and date fraud we called it exciting. Somehow womens romance novels are not titled He Stopped When I Said No. They are though titled Sweet Savage Love in which the woman rejects the hand of her gentler lover who saves her from the rapist and marries the man who repeatedly and savagely rapes her. It is this marry the rapist theme that not only turned Sweet Savage Love into a bestseller but also into one of womens most enduring romance novels. And it is Rhett Butler carrying the kicking and screaming Scarlett OHara to bed who is a hero to females  not to males  in Gone With the Wind the best selling romance novel of all time  to women. It is important that a womans noes be respected and her yeses be respected. emphasis mine And it is also important when her nonverbal yeses tongues still touching conflict with those verbal noes that the man not be put in jail for choosing the yes over the no.,UBC,dddpg54,3,t5_2qy2j

10966286,0,t1_deavmog,gtSo I would be hesitant to have someone call that narcissism as it will alienate a lot of people who put effort into a community you want to be apart of. My tone is admittedly harsh. But I honestly do believe that many candidates running use these positions in quantity rather than quality to create some kind of illusion that theyre competent leaders.My goal wasnt to alienate people it was to characterize the average candidate here. Im simply unwilling to campaign based on irrelevant experience. There are exceptions for example a particular VP Academic Candidate has had experience in Senate. But in many cases I would take the nomination bid of a member of a mental health awareness club much more seriously than I would take an AMS Vice Presidents. A member of a mental health awareness club clearly didnt join just to get an exec position they probably joined because they have a real commitment to mental health theyre passionate about change theyre passionate about ridding the world of one big plight.But being an AMS Vice President doesnt entail the same thing. The AMS is a very concrete institution with differing goals and it isnt particularly a position of passion. Its an institution first and foremost. You can have all sorts of experience in paperwork and meetings networking and wine tasting but that doesnt particularly strike me as a real commitment to change that strikes me as someone who has experience in administration.Weve filled the positions of the AMS BoG and Senate by the name recognition of the established. Im sure theyre fine and dandy for administration but I have yet to see any real change or any real commitment to change.Im pretty set in stone about this for now that experience at the undergraduate level rarely correlates to success in governance.Lets do a case study AMS President Ava Nasiri. She has been VP Admin for two years and before that she was AUS VP Admin. Thats a total of three years in office not including her current term.Ava campaigned on a number of platform promises Implement a fall reading break FAILED Student Engagement Passive at best. Provide monthly updates on the longterm financial sustainability of the AMS FAILED Ensure that the AMS is financially transparent FAILED Ubyssey is running a referendum right now to get the lineitem budget Bring in a case competition to address the AMS budget deficit Considering its March Im going to preemptively state FAILED Implement a UBrew system at the AMS Microbrewery FAILED Reopen the Gallery . SUCCESS She had no option it was a binding referendum decision.She did nearly nothing. She was polite kind wellmannered to me but she still didnt do anything and failed miserably when it came to transparency goals. Perhaps there is an argument to be made that both passionate changemakers and competent administrators need to be elected but thats up for debate.   ,UBC,deb3fmq,3,t5_2qy2j

11038256,0,t3_5xftpq,Im registered with access amp diversity for pretty much all the same things youre having issues with and the concessions I get are .x the time for exams. They also ask about what things about exams cause you to panic so they can let you take your exams in the best environment possible for you e.g. smaller room room with no people you can use earplugs to block out ALL noise etc etc. Then during exams you just go to their set room and write it with the few others who have a test that day usually theres not a lot during finals I had like  other people in the room with me and during midterms maybe like ? They also can give you the option to defer the exam in the case of finals which usually means youll end up writing the exam when the next terms class does which could be way too long like if you defer an exam that should be in april and that course isnt being offered in the summer youd have to wait until December.I was also in the same boat as you with homeworks I just stopped doing any of them and what they did was check with my professors about my current mark and see if it was still possible to pass the course with my final exam marks and if it was then Id just take the final amp defer it if I wanted to and hope I get a high enough mark to still pass or they could get me a medical withdraw from the course so I could retake it next year amp avoid possibly getting a fail mark.In the case you do fail or get really poor grades and youre in danger of being kicked out of school they can also help you out with repealing I havent been in this situation yet so I dont know how much they can affect it but I would hope it would workSo Id definitely recommend you go get registered with them asap! The whole registration process was a lot less stressful than I thought it would be. You do need to provide medical proof but they do give you time to get it I think I ended up taking a few months to get it to them there wasnt much of a rush and I was having issues with my doctor and Im not sure but I think your counsellor would be able to do it for you? you might need someone with a medical degree though I cant rememberBut yeah AampD has been great theyre probably the best people Ive dealt with at UBC and Im disappointed I didnt register with them way soonerGood luck!,UBC,dej60rd,2,t5_2qy2j

Lose the selfdefeating attitude you showed in  you dont need to be a genius to impress... showing youre hardworking in general and doing your best to engage understand and go beyond what youre required is just as admirable Id argue more but thats my opinion not his as genius.Dont try to make a move before the semester ends because it puts him in a shitty position due to the disparity of power in the relationship but definitely feel free to make a move at the last session of your tutorial or afterward.  Worst case he says no and you move on.  A little more on  Some girls worry that asking a guy out seems aggressive which is a complete misconception.  Spoilers all the guys Ive befriended and have asked out say that a girl asking them out is a relief more than anything.

Also doing it in the morning keeps your body in that active state throughout the day metabolic rate. He did mention frequency and intensity. Also it depends on the muscle mass he has. Assuming he had muscle before and  hours of training a day would have made some muscle as well. ALSO it depends on hisher metabolic rate which varies by person to person.ALSO it depends on his diet which he mentioned a healthy one. For all we know a healthy diet could mean chicken breasts eggs and salads all day.So tldr the human body is more than just math  its not as simple as doing a simple calculation and its pretty rude to just dismiss ppl like that especially since the guygirl had no harmful intentions.

I could have a couple beers and do some homework but at some point in time it became a game to me of how much I could drink and still pull things off. Im hungover now and realize how serious this problem is. Only a few days ago I took an inclass exam and immediately went home and got on the bottle. My friend invited me out but I was already way too drunk to and declined out of embarrassment. When I realized I was trying to avoid people who I actually like because i am ashamed of having a problem I realized how big the problem is. I hated shots but at some point I decided beer took too long to drink and by the time I had a few in me I was full although i could stand to get more drunk. Typically I slam  shots since we have  shot glasses at home and then once I feel myself sobering take another. I am actually pretty productive when close to blackout though and if I didnt break anything I would wake up to a spotless suite. Thats the good side though in a daze Ive woken up to embarrassing texts and my friend said one time he saw me outside trying to light the filter end of the cigarette  and I usually dont smoke even drunk.

The personal profile really makes it or breaks it a girl I know applied with a great average but didnt make it because her personal profile wasnt as strong as it could have been.

I like Math and Physics and my teachers for those courses so studying wasnt too much of a chore it was just choosing between studying and Netflix that was difficult. Yes you should have time to watch Netflix but dont let that intrude on your grades. As for my personal profile I wrote about my time in cadets and how it developed my leadership skills.

My primary concern is that these things shouldnt happen again the Soldiers of Odin are a great example of what we would like to avoid.

11531212,0,t3_5tkza7,Hi Im sorry if there is already a post about this but I tried searching and couldnt find one! anyway I was just acepted into UBC as a transfer student from first year  I was really suprised honestly cause me and my entire family kinda thought there was no chance as my GPA isnt super high and neither was my high school marks. Im coming up to my finals this semester and im feeling really nervous about them. I was wondering would UBC revoke my admission if my GPA dropped a few points ? I wont fail my courses but i might get a pretty bad mark in one of them my average is at a  in econ Do they ever revoke admissions if your mark drops a bit ??,UBC,dg32cmr,1,t5_2qy2j

11666896,0,t1_dgi7z6t,I sometimes think of Waterloo but I dont see Waterloo as academically competent as UBC I see waterloo as a place where some people go to get some jobs. waterloo gives more importance to the destination where you will end up at a big company but besides that you dont have much qualifications as you graduate from the th university But ubc seems like a more academical school where you can also go to some IVY schools for grad school or become a phd if you happen to get a good gpa. you can even go to MIT if you do so or you can also work at some big companies.I mean UBC provides more opportunities at least it it what it seems likeBesides that considering the location and beauty of the campus of ubc I dont think that waterloo is as socially active as ubc. What I am nervous about is that I dont want to spend my life ata place where I will be bothered with the gaps in the system or the profs who does not want to teach. I can ace any exam as soon as I know the topics and thought about those topics but Will I be taught so? because self learning is not my thing. If some prof answers my question as go learn yourself  this would be the biggest reason that I will go elsewhere.,UBC,dgighvs,1,t5_2qy2j
