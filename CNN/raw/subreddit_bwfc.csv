4692444,0,t1_ctlyubr,gt  It is my understanding that every league match is professionally recorded  this is why we have such good highlights. Your right there since they broadcast video footage around the inside of the ground. Not to mention you can sometimes see the cameramen around the ground but Im not sure weather they are by the club or by some sort of national organization. I do understand what you mean by there are other sources other than Sky broadcasted on match day and it is worth checking every match day. Although the betting websites require an account and sometimes a bet to watch the streams there is always a stream link which you dont. Either way its still a bit disappointing not being able to stream matches. Its sort of the next best thing after being at the ground.,bwfc,ctm0w3u,3,t5_2sjpl
4750659,0,t3_3fzcpp,After another player we had on loan last season. I cant see us stumping up enough cash for a permanent deal so I think he is more likely destined to be playing at a different club next year ,bwfc,cttd67n,1,t5_2sjpl
