5344652,0,t3_3o4k9c,Im with you but IMHO they should have just started with a blank canvas. No HRG no Hiro no cheerleader. They wrote themselves into a corner last time why start there again? We all wouldve watched anything with the Heroes badge on it with or without returning characters.,HeroesReborn,cvuu7zm,3,t5_30j9m
5469034,0,t1_cwap3hq,Fat guy I can excuse because hes supposed to be an incompetent civilian.  Harris is supposed to be a badass though.  Other characters are just normal Hollywood bad but the crap where Harris puts the gun across his nonshooting forearm is just ridiculous.,HeroesReborn,cwapyk5,6,t5_30j9m
5469849,0,t3_3oxyqz,When Harris encountered Farrah and Malina I believe he said wheres the baby?. I feel like Malina is older than she should be possibly Claires daughter if we combine our theories.,HeroesReborn,cwatpf4,2,t5_30j9m
5480763,0,t1_cwc3uld,Yeah I thought that too but Storm or the Planeteers cant make trees grow on a dime...or really control magnetic phenomena either but Im more willing to chalk that one up to Air than I am with the tree ,HeroesReborn,cwc7vzk,1,t5_30j9m
5542624,0,t1_cwiyctm,Not to mention Im not sure this show is gonna even have a season  the way things are going. This episode was a big stepup though. Nice predictions btw,HeroesReborn,cwk43pt,1,t5_30j9m

5764101,0,t1_cxbki5t,I think it ended up his thing because the writersstaff realized that they made him too powerful and he had too much control over his powers.I think it could have worked if he could Teleport through time in space but couldnt control the power or didnt understand how it worked.  That way we never had to worry about him always being able to go back in time and fix things or going forward in time and figuring out what happens next.,HeroesReborn,cxbl90z,2,t5_30j9m
