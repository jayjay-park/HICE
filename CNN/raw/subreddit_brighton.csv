This encompasses a whole host of identities and bigendered would be described as feeling like youre both genders people can feel this differently and there may be some fluidity within this one day the person may feel more male and some days more female but some people just solidly feel both all the time. People who identify as such typically use gender neutral pronouns such as they but its always best to ask about pronouns if youre unsure. ,brighton,chxus2s,0,t5_2qprp

1694003,0,t3_2dsplo,That flat seems like a good deal but its in Hangleton which is a a bit of a rough area and b miles away from anything interesting. Me and the missus love in a nice bed place in Hove spacious near the sea nice area and we pay . If youre prepared to pay that you should have no trouble. If you want cheaper youll have to decide what youre prepared to compromise on usually its a choice between living space and location. The property rental market in Brighton and Hove is very competitive. Good deals go within a few days if being advertised. Id advise you to set up email alerts with Zoopla and Prime Location and be ready to see flats on the day they are advertised. Also take around  in cash with you so you can put down a holding deposit as soon as you see one you like. EDIT  Looks like Hangleton is not as bad as I remember it. I havent been up there for a while but my abiding memory of it is that my brother used to go there to score smack which may have coloured my opinion of the place. Apologies to Hangletonians.,brighton,cjsoy39,3,t5_2qprp

Letting Agents are the lowest form of scum on planet earth  remember these are the people who didnt make the grade to be estate agents a job where the only skills required are owning a cheap suit and a tub of hair gel. You will pay money for all sorts of unnecessary shit your rent will go up for no reason youll NEVER be able to get anything fixed either in a reasonable timeframe or to a reasonable standard. And then when you leave its a lottery as to how much of your deposit they will steal for no fathomable reason I once found that a letting agent who charged me  for cleaning already a pisstake as Im borderline OCD only actually paid the cleaner .

The people I know who have done it basically pay the same as if they were only renting but this way they are at least paying off a mortgage as part of it. It depends on whether youd like to own further out of town and buy  that might still be tough with a k budget or live in the centre and do shared ownership.
