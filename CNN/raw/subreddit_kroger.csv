9314890,0,t3_5817wc,Nice. Definitely wish I had known this the first day but oh well I figured it out most of it is pretty commonwhich a surprising number of people lack. Some more tipsBagging . Keep coldfrozen stuff together although its not a huge deal if a few nonfrozen stuff ends up mixed in some customers are very anal about this.. Dont be afraid to ask for clarification if you dont understand how a customer wants something bagged. If theres a ton of heavy shit that doesnt need to be bagged and only a few things that need to be ask the cashier to keep the heavy shit in the same basket. It will make everyones life easier.. Pay attention if there is a bunch of drinks or something heavy to save room for them in the cart. If they bring a car cart or motorized ask if they want it back in that cart.  chance they dont for some reason. If someone comes up with a small double decker cart overflowing with groceries run away. You might want to give them a big cart because stuff always takes up more room once its bagged but use your best judgement. If you get that one fucker who wants all paper inside of plastic or viseversa... god help youPaper inside of plasticOpen plastic bag. Place paper inside of plastic bag then open the paper bag. Proceed with bagging as usual.Plastic inside of paperMake sure not to overfill plastic bags so that they will fit inside of paper. Bag as normal putting the heavy stuff at the bottom of the paper bag of course.Cart PushingDitto everything that OP said. With small carts definitely use the straps or else dont push more than you can safely hold and maneuver in your armspan. Of course depending on your store straps may always be required always technically required and better to use unless youre really confident. Watch where the fuck youre going. Stay hydrated. Make sure the carts are securely together. You do not want them popping loose in the middle of the lot. Trust me.. If the row of carts you are pushing starts to form into a curved line like a banana stop and readjust. This is particularly common with the small carts hence why number Reshop tips. Sort items into sections of the store they belong in. This might already done for you to some extent depending on your store.. I find its easier to walk down an aisle then look in the cart to see if something belongs there rather than choosing an item and then looking for its location.Locating cigarettes depending on your store you may or may not be allowed to get this. Check with your manager.. If the customer has the kind they are looking for ask if you can take the box with you. Makes the whole process a lot easier and quicker. Make sure you have correct order before walking over there. Carton vs. Pack. s vs. ShortsRegulars. If its something ambiguous or unusual then ask or get someone to show you I probably have more tips but that all for the moment. We should add this to the sidebar or something.,kroger,d8wqbtc,3,t5_2svtr
9451294,0,t3_5a6dsl,First rule about working here fuck their guilt shit. They wont fire you because they cant afford to lose any employees and the corrupt union is not in a position to deny you help. Just shove the doctors note in their face if they pestor you and come in for your hours. Simple as that. ,kroger,d9e0nwb,8,t5_2svtr

9849665,0,t3_5g7swa,As a Supervisor I honestly think I got the bad end of a deal. . is definitely not enough for me to live on even when Im working  hours per week almost every week. I cant complain about not getting hours at least because I can work extra hours after we close at midnight if I need an extra boost in my paycheck. Im definitely not supposed to get overtime but it does happen sometimes.,kroger,darfn4g,1,t5_2svtr
10342772,0,t3_5o1zql,When you belong to the union everyone gets contractual raises instead of performance based raises. If you are full time then obviously you will be scheduled . If you are parttime beware of how many hours you work. If you have been told you can get full time try to get the store manager to affirm that. Sometimes anything will be said to help fill critical positions. Then that person gets strung along just until they might be eligible for full time status and right before theyve hit the hoursweeks requirement their hours are reduced to keep them at part time. ,kroger,dcgeu8j,2,t5_2svtr
10867049,0,t1_de0kt88,Fair enough. Try asking customers what recipie theyre making if they ask for something fancy like Ginger or scallions that may spark some conversation. Or why they prefer one kind of apple over another. Especially if you work FOH at your other job youre probably good at taking about food. If your deli has a specialty cheese section you may try to transfer there. I wouldnt recommend fuel center very little meaningful interaction out there. ,kroger,de0uxm6,1,t5_2svtr

11610739,0,t3_6530jz,It depends on whether youre in a right to work state or not. In right to work states union membership is not a requirement for employment. However California is not a right to work state so they can absolutely make you join the union as a requirement for employment. ,kroger,dgc35oz,2,t5_2svtr
