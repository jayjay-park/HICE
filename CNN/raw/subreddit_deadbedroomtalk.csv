6277787,0,t1_cz35vus,Thank you for your response. I know it is very common sense we need to talk. I am just terrified to take that step and maybe find out the damage is irrepairable. I did a lot of terrible things that even now a decade afterward still have consequences. My husband is a very fiscally conservative and responsible person. I am not although now with our son to think about I am trying. I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling. He says he forgives me but I cannot forgive myself and believe that even though he truly has he will never trust me. The hell of it is I understand completely and do not blame him but it has also created a power imbalance in our relationship where I am never feeling like an adult. Even now at . I am wondering. Men would you forgive your wife REALLY forgive for uncontrollable compulsive gambling and the huge terrible lies that come from efforts to cover up and hide the addiction? I have not gambled compulsively for nearly  years. I still have some of those behaviors though. Secrecy when it comes to money a natural impulse to lie if that makes things easier for me. I have come to trust myself that I wont drive us to financial ruin and we now have substantial savings and a solid college savings plan for our son. But I also know I am not cured since I have a secret credit card account which I dont even need but keep because I dont want to be hassled over impulse purchases that I feel we can well afford ... But even that is only partially true. The other part is I need the control that the secrecy provides and yes I know that I am seriously messed up. ,deadbedroomtalk,cz37p9e,1,t5_33mot
