8513229,0,t3_4ulna7,Chapter     It is so strange that I level up from fighting so many of these hounds but I cant level up from fighting a lot of wolves and bears. Leveling up must have something to do with fighting new monsters and gaining new experiences. I decide to use the points on wisdom to see where my mana takes me.    gtStatus  gtName Homogeneous Khalidius  gtLevel   gtClass Novice  gtCredits   gtHealth   gtStamina   gtMana   gtStrength   gtDexterity   gtVitality   gtInteligence   gtWisdom   gtLuck   gtStat Points Available     Almost k credits which is huge! I see that my mana has increased at a rate of  per  point in wisdom which is great. I can now use magic for  longer and my recharge rate for mana also increased. I dont have any for sure way of telling so I will just have to observe it in action.    For the rd day I decide to visit the far away town. I want to turn in the quest from the Adventurers Guild and buy ingredients for alchemy. Although Alchemy was a skill ingredients were not something I could buy from the shop. Its a shame but some things just cant be bought. While Im at it I might as well look for other magic books that cant be bought from the shop.    It takes me about  hours to reach the far town so I arrive some time in the early morning of the th day. I could spend the night at the tavern but this time I decide to spend the night working on the hides of the IronHide Devil Hounds. From each of the hounds I am able to get approximately  pounds of iron! Screw mining killing these things is where its at!    Thinking about the quest reward a measly  credits for ten of these gold mines! Screw that Im telling the bitch Im dropping the quest! I take the iron from each hide and get  pounds! With such a bombass source of iron I wont ever have to mine unless I can find a location for orchelium or demon ore.    When morning comes around the Adventurers Guild is the first place to open. I go inside walking tall and I slap the quest poster on the desk.    I want to cancel this quest I say to the woman at the desk and she looks up.    It too hard for you? She says and she turns the paper around to read it.    I just dont feel like it I say and then I walk out of there.    A few minutes later I realize I didnt get another quest. Well I can never go back there again. As I walk around the town I am a little disappointed at how small it is. There really isnt much here. I decide to visit the alchemy shop because why not.    We need  Valburner  Flounfly and  Frostglow. Someone is already in the shop and he is talking to a very old woman at a counter. On the counter is already four piles of strange materials.     Right right The old woman says and she makes a note on a piece of paper and then takes out three jars from under the counter. She counts each of the materials and puts them into piles next to the other four. Thatll be  credits.     Damn alchemy is expensive!  Transfer  credits. The man says and then he takes the ingredients into his own inventory. He turns to leave and he looks at me. You are you a lone adventurer?    Yeah I say back to him not sure what to say. He is the first adventurer Ive talked to at least knowingly. He has a sword in a sheath on his side and is wearing steel armor. I dont have a sword or even a bow equipped but I do have leather armor on and not clothes like a regular person.    Good how would you like to earn some credits by traveling with my party? I dont know what to say. I want to explore but I just learned about this great source of iron. I could make so much money from those hounds!    Well where are you going? If he is going somewhere nearby then Ill bite. If not Ill pass.    We are going to visit the Holy Sword of Nordas. Oh what luck. Ive been darn close to there before and I can get back home easily. Shouldnt be a problem.    Sure Ill go. I live quite close to there actually. The entire trip should take two or three days including the time it takes to go from the holy sword back home.    Excellent The man says and he walks behind me. Finish your business here and come follow me.  ,2kw,d65pmir,1,t5_3fkr3
8513328,0,t3_4v34nv,Chapter   I look around with Night Vision and Heat Vision and some big black creature with a thousand pointy teeth in its mouth is coming towards me.    It is moving slow but the body looks gelatinous and almost a liquid. I take the items from Valerys inventory and place them in my own then I start to back away from the thing.    Its a foot high worm or maybe worse a leech. As I back away the leech puts its entire mouth around Valerys body and sucks her inside of itself.    I think Im going to throw up. I did this to her. If not for me she would be going home to her family not being eaten by some jelly leech after falling  feet and dying.     I get out one of Valerys swords and hold it in front of myself. Its only meant for a single hand so I remove my left hand and take out Valerys shield. I dont any experience with a shield but I at least have the Swordfighting skill.    Instead of waiting for the leech to get close enough to me to bite I use fire magic and torch the bitch. I can use basic magic for  seconds or intermediate magic for two seconds. I choose intermediate and I rush forward with the sword before the leech can react to anything other than the ball of fire in its face.    I slash downward at the lower section of the leechs mouth and green blood falls to the ground of the cave. When the leech is hit it moves its head upwards and away from me but quickly falls back down.    I have ninja movement and I roll to the side. With another slash at the leech it drops even more green blood but it still has fight in its body.    I partly dodge and partly block an attempt by the leech to eat me as I dodge to the left and I get another slash in on the leechs mouth. As the leech rears back in pain I put the sword away and get Valerys crossbow and a bolt out.    The crossbow is easier than I thought it would be to pull back and I release the bolt through the leech. The leech dies from the bolt and I put away Valerys equipment.    gtLevelup!  Oh yay thats nice to see with all the shit going on right now.  Shes in there though. Valery is inside the leech and I have to get her out. I cant just leave her body inside there to rot. I have to get her out. I need to bring her back home to someone who can give her a proper burial.    With Valerys dagger I cut open the leech. Green blood gallons more than possibly contained inside freely flowed out through the cuts and made a deep puddle on the ground. With xray vision I can see where Valery is mixing with the stomach contents of the monster and I fish her out fairly quickly.    Once Valery is out and a few feet from the monster I get some cloth from the pile and use it to clean her a little. With some Water Magic I also summon some water to wash her off. Once Valery is as clean as I can get her I put her in my inventory.    gtDead Valery Odule    Damn this sucks. Now I have to get out of this cave somehow. Before that though Im going to use those five stat points.    gtStatus  gtName Chris Meme    gtLevel   gtClass Proficent  gtCredits   gtHealth   gtStamina   gtMana   gtStrength   gtDexterity   gtVitality   gtInteligence   gtWisdom   gtLuck   gtStat Points Available     Five points into Vitality will help survivability and Im going to run out of here as fast as I can so the increased stamina will help. With these adjustments I run.    I cant see a way out with night vision but I run. I cant see a way out with heat vision but I run. I cant even see a way out with xray vision but I just keep running. Stamina is the amount of time in minutes that I can perform at maximum strength. With running my all which is exceptionally fast I can run for and hour and fifteen minutes.   ,2kw,d65q2lm,1,t5_3fkr3
8513347,0,t3_4v34nv,Chapter     Here we have some of the best bows forgable. Here in our little village we have a master smith who has worked on bows for several decades. All of these bows were forged here excpect for the demon bow you can see here The man pointed to the demon bow on the rack.    They look nice but not anything better than what I already have. What do you have here that I can only buy here? I ask and he starts to think of a bit.    Well we do have some vampire slaves if you are into that kind of thing.    How much? I ask him wanting to get a solid price. I want to buy a slave. Hopefully a really sexy one.    Well He says scratching his chin and his red eyes brighten slightly. We have a few labourers for k credits and we have some females for k credits and up. Damn thats way too much and a lot more than I expected.    That is a little more than I expected I say to the man. Im afraid I dont have that much.    Well vampires are known to have a lifespan of anywhere from  to  years so you could have a slave to serve both you and your descendants. Thats nice but I dont think I want to share with my descendants thank you very much.    Is there an inn I can stay at in the village? I have some raw materials I would like to refine. I ask the man. If I an turn the rest of my iron into iron swords or even better steel swords I might have enough.    There is an inn but you would be the only human there and nowhere in the village will buy from you. Other than raw materials the village will only buy manufactured goods from other villagers. Well I dont need anyone in the village to buy from me I can sell it all to the shop. Selling to the shop is the best way too because that way I dont have to worry about over saturating the market with iron swords.    That is fine thank you. I say and then I leave. Outside the store the guard is waiting for me. Im going to stay in this village a few days. Can you show me where the inn is? I ask. I hope Im not asking too much from him.     Sure. He says and he starts walking. We dont get visitors very often and much less often from other races. I continue to follow the man until we reach the inn. I can tell by the sign outside that says INN in very large letters. It must be hard for normal people to see down here with the limited light so I really am lucky with all the different visions I have.    Thank you I say to the man and I go inside. Inside the inn are several vampires and not a single human. I go up to the counter and talk to the woman behind it. Hi I would like to get a room here.    A human... She says looking me up and down. I can tell the others behind me are also looking. I dont like it. Certainly we are  credits a night.    I plan on staying several days. Can I have the same room reserved for that time period?    Of course just pay the amount for each day you want the room for. Good I need to stay at least three nights if it is the th. If not It doesnt matter much  credits wont kill me.    Okay I say and I take her hand. Transfer  credits. With that I have my room.    The woman gave me a key to a room on the second floor and I went inside first thing. Once inside the room I take a look at myself and realize I am filthy. I need to do something about this.    I leave the inn and walk to the edge of the village. The stream leads around the village so I go back the way I came and meet with the man who did not follow me inside the village.  ,2kw,d65q5p4,1,t5_3fkr3
