332189,0,t1_cfeolk8,I suppose it depends on your goal. You could also build this on a proto board or bread board if you dont want to spring for a printed board. Oh and he does list the full list of materials needed. You may have to shop around to find good prices on some of them without buying in bulk.I wonder if there would be enough interesting to try and do a MassDrop style order for this.,BeagleBone,cff7a70,1,t5_2t6hn
1339546,0,t1_cijx4e7,No but Ive pretty much confirmed plugging a display in fixes the problem. I was suspecting a firmware problem but not I think its actually hardware. Maybe a floating ground or something that a display pulls down.Without a display I get constant reboots with a display itll stay on for days without an issue.,BeagleBone,cikbc3e,1,t5_2t6hn
2516750,0,t1_cmmtscz,I didnt keep track of the running costs but probably around . More if you count the first Beaglebone that I fried.,BeagleBone,cmn2sd0,1,t5_2t6hn
2650426,0,t1_cn4i905,Do you know or do you know.  I have known many things in the past only to discover later that I was wrong after i verified it.The USBampgtserial is just a debug tool to test the two pieces independently from one another.  To make sure your scale of outputting what you believe it to be and to make sure your bb is properly interpreting what its getting. Personally I wouldnt kludge anything. I would just use a RS transceiver,BeagleBone,cn4jim5,1,t5_2t6hn

3716767,0,t1_cqfg42y,It asks a disk image to read onto but I dont have any blank disk images. Not sure if i missed something there.,BeagleBone,cqfxrx0,1,t5_2t6hn
4012243,0,t1_crdjxrl,Thanks! Ill try that I was running as sudo so I figured it would have worked without modifying anything. Ill try it when I go in tomorrow,BeagleBone,crdmkk2,1,t5_2t6hn

8690601,0,t1_d6rptbc,I will try to study about how kernel work. Thank for your suggestion !,BeagleBone,d6rybyy,1,t5_2t6hn
10344915,0,t1_dcgmtkl,Sounds about right. You check that multimeter to a known voltage source. ,BeagleBone,dcgnlbe,2,t5_2t6hn
11203622,0,t3_5n3tgu,If it were my project Id skip the idea of using any IP and simply use a wireless serial interface that you can put together using NRFL family serial wireless devices. These are small really power thrifty and easy to package with the BBB. This will allow you to do development work using a simple wired serial interface and drop in the wireless component late in the development cycle. You can develop your own SCPI compliant protocol to do the control and monitoring functions which makes for easy interactive test and debug cycles. Essentially youd be doing what Test amp Measurement instrument makers do when they add communications interfaces to their gear. Whatever wireless scheme you use youll probably want to be careful about the effect of switching big electrical loads I infer from MOSFET switching as EMI will come back through the antenna and foul things up.,BeagleBone,df1wzom,2,t5_2t6hn
