917190,0,t1_ch8em6p,I am trying to pick up F as someone coming from a unix background as a way to diversify my programming portfolioso I am for seeing F being a true crossplatform contender. Regarding Scala  perhaps the most successful story on JVM for functional programming backed by quite some marketing push. And marketing does help as opposed to microsofts Hey our top nerds like F we are supporting it but we really dont mean to scare the hoipoloi away from C approach. Haskell is far out there to act as a hiring filter a la the python paradox.OCaml is actually pretty fine these days especially with opam etc.. They are progressing steadily. Not much of hoopla but not languishing either. ,fsharp,ch8jgu9,6,t5_2qkey

1299114,0,t1_chb133f,The Scala hate in this thread is pretty funny.  For that matter there is no grand treatise on large systems F development either.I would like to see more FP in any form penetrate the market regardless of which language carries it in.  FP in only a few languages will not gain mindshare from developers fast enough the multipronged approach is good for all of us.,fsharp,cifrmif,3,t5_2qkey
1504923,0,t1_cj4juk7,Apparently experienced Fsharpers dont like pointfree style for toplevel definitions because it somewhat hides the function arguments and their types. I can somewhat see the logic but personally I prefer pointfree.,fsharp,cj4wyr9,1,t5_2qkey

3672373,0,t3_32emmz,Azure .NET MS SQL Visual Studio etc.  F FAKE is awesome for build automation its a great way to weasel F into the edges on large projects with low risk.  IMO its the least headache to run as much MS as possible if you go .NET but Ive been doing .NET dev for  years now and my focus is more on solving issues in the business domain than performing technical wizardry with our stack.If youre talking .NET web apps I always liked the StackOverflow architecture discussion for thoughts on scaling.  Performance characteristics hereCheck out this recent HN discussion and linked article for a bunch of solid .NET libraries.  For F web dev here is a good start.,fsharp,cqavhlu,2,t5_2qkey

4857569,0,t3_3hexcu,It isnt a thing for exactly the reason you pointed out  lack of preinstallation.  Powershell might be ugly but you have to compare it to what came before batch files.  Over batch Powershell is a massive upgrade and can do serious work right out of the box. Now of course nothing stops you from doing it on the machines you control.. there are far worse solution in common use... but you would be in relatively uncharted territory. ,fsharp,cu6u06z,4,t5_2qkey
6140352,0,t3_3zko7m,Why isnt scala on your list? I coded in f for about a year before moving to scala scala is by far my favorite language to do production work in. Theres a larger community than both clojure and f and increasing demand for scala savvy devs.,fsharp,cynldut,2,t5_2qkey

7196825,0,t1_d1vmojg,Functional languages dont tend to use ORMs. While in theory you could use any C ORM in practice youll use either a SQL type provider or youll use something like dapper. Testing also becomes much easier with a functional language if you write functionally since all of the functions dependencies are passed in as arguments. This all but entirely removes the need for mocksRailway orientated programming can also help you with logging since youll just compose your functions with a tee that happens to log. As for learning overall F sharp for fun and profit is by far the best single resource for learning not just how but why. ,fsharp,d1w7xw0,3,t5_2qkey

9568131,0,t1_d9saqyy,Thank you for your indepth feedback! Its very helpful.The code quotations for property accessors are mainly there for us to generate the field name as string in the JSON. We use a simple function like this    let nameOfProperty quot         match quot with        | Lambda s PropertyGet  name  gt name.Name        |  gt failwith Something went wrongTo get the name of the field    let e  lt fun d gt d.Date gt    printfn s nameOfProperty e    gt Prints DateIts a typesafe way to get the field name that will continue to work if we refactor  rename the property.,fsharp,d9sguea,2,t5_2qkey

10157031,0,t1_dbv1axn,gt From what I can see the type provider relies on a document based API XElement resulting in it reading the whole file into memory.
