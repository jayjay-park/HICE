Mushrooms can and do grow in the dark but if you want the best yield and good looking crop you introduce light cycles one you have a good pin set and you do this because they will grow toward the light. The only things light does is a act as a pin trigger and b suggest to the mushrooms that they grow upward... or whichever direction the light is coming from.

Since you are on the too moist side fanning wouldnt hurt anything and will reduce the amount of moisture but it wont get rid of the fuzzy feet.The fuzzy feet wont hurt anything and just a little is a good indication that your moisture is just slightly too much which is not a bad place to be.Nice grow keep the myc running!,shroomers,cihrsdz,1,t5_2s3yi

2138895,0,t3_2jflkd,Those are some seriously fucked up mushrooms I like em. You should try and remove all of the fruit when you pick them I notice you leave a lot of the base still on the substrate. You need exposed mycelium or casing layer. The fruit that you left still attached will probably rot and cause some problems so take care of that asap.  You can also pick them as the ripen to your satisfaction you dont have to harvest them all at once. You just want to make sure its not starting to pin again while there are still nearly mature fruits that you are harvesting. Short small fruit usually means not enough moisture not enough consolidation usually results in a regular first flush but far weaker ones following that.

I use MEA and have good results. Heres where I get my petri dishes. For starting out get the X plates. You get  tries on a single plate.Keep trying until you have a agar plate that shows no sign of contams transfer a wedge piece to some prepared spawn grain jar. When the jar is fully colonized do grain to grain GG transfers to  more jars. You can take those  jars and knock up  jars. You get the idea. With GG and the correct temps it usually takes  days to fully colonized after GG. You can spot contams easier in a grain jar than you can in LC.

3078427,0,t1_cogsi1t,Just confirming these thoughts.IF you are growing fruits to be judged by a panel of mushroom growing aficionados surely harvesting before the veil breaks will be one of the grading criteria.Other than that this shit is meaningless. My objective is to use the least amount of space to produce the most mushrooms by weight as possible. This can be significantly increased by allowing the fruits to pancake or in other words let the caps of the fruits flatten out. Sure  you can get some sporulation from time to time if you get too lazyhave uneven pinsets...but they do keep growing after the veil breaks and thats how I look at it.Unless youre rockin an isolate potency is really a crap shoot.

How are your jars filtered? And why do you still have the foil on? That should be removed after sterilization.

Turn your oven on to the lowest possible temperature and keep an oven thermometer clipped to the front of the rack.Pull the rack part of the way out of the oven and leave the door open.

Pasteurize the coir and verm  ratio coirverm and use a  ratio of substrate and spawn.Whatever amount of spawn you use will be equivalent to the amount of substrate. You could either mix the colonized grain or seed with the substrate or layer it one jar at a time one sub one spawn one sub one spawn etc. just make sure theres some sub on the bottom and at the top to cover exposed grainseed. Let it colonize then expose it to fruiting conditions. Also cut your lining at the substrate layer. It needs to shrink with the substrate. Keep bottom holes stuffed tight top holes barely stuffed at all. Put a fan in the room on low facing AWAY from the tub.

8066253,0,t3_4p8grk,If you already bought a kit and you have it in the fridge just buy the spores and inoculate those. If you dont have your mind set on using kits in the future read a lot about pf tek. If you want to get serious about growing mushrooms learn about casing and the way mycelium works learn about the substrate you use for the strain you are growing. Learn from this grow. Learn about sterility.For future reference though it is a lot cheaper in the long run to buy the stuff yourself along with a pressure cooker. Then all you need to do is shop to keep up the ingredients and then you can make your own spore print and syringe from this grow.,shroomers,d4mq1jv,1,t5_2s3yi

8577003,0,t1_d6dglox,Yes agar is awesome!Here is a good tek that can give you a general idea of what to do with agar.Heres a good thread where someone tests  isolates he made for speed and yield.And finally if you decide you want to dive into agar today heres a great thread on making some plates from stuff at the grocery store.Anytime you use MS you can get a varied potency or even bunk fruits.

8771257,0,t1_d71w85j,Oh well shit if youre talking fruiting then yeah itll still fruit. Im saying the mold will over take everything. Also once that shit is green its spreading spores everywhere.

9240678,0,t1_d8n12hg,Yeah that makes sense.  He was so upset for some reason while tripping and didnt go into it with a good mindset. He dragged you down in a way without meaning to and caused your trip to go bad.  Ive never had that happen to me but Ive had plenty of other fucked up things happen.  Its all good dude youll find it again.  If you have another person youre close with and think they would be interested talk to them about it. Its all about having a good group and perfect mindset.  Someone you vibe really good with.  Its interesting that you think your purpose is to gain knowledge because thats mine as well.  I realized this on my second trip ever. I was with two friends and we talked about so many things we all realized we were atheists that night in my basement.  I just want to learn everything I possibly can to make rational decisions. I want to be as knowledgeable as possible. Life is fucking whack but youll get into the flow again.  I recently did my first trip a week or so ago after a really long time of not tripping.  The time before that I experienced a loop which was one of the scariest things that have ever happened in my mind.  My mindset was good but the environment I had put myself in was not.  I was tripping with another person but we split up to go hangout with some of our friends while he went with someone else to drop other people off so the driver wasnt alone after.  The people I was with made me really think about it and it changed my perspective on our friendship in a good way for me anyways.  I realized I wasnt comfortable in those kinds of situations and that I could never do or be on a psychedelic around them.  I was thankful one of my best friends was there to essentially rescue me from the loop i text him and we left.  Hes actually my favorite person to trip with and he really helped me calm down.  I didnt trip for a few months and then we both tripped together.  I had a fucking great time and put all of that past me.  Everything happens for a reason and youll figure it out.  Edit sorry for the novel ,shroomers,d8nbn39,2,t5_2s3yi
