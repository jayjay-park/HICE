Steven Pippin works on a similar theme check out his laundromat locomotion with washing machines turned into cameras he also turned an entire photo booth cabin into a camera obscura to take autoportraits posing in the street.

533468,0,t1_cg0vutt,I just realized Im trying to have a civil conversation with someone who actually WANTS to be referred to as a snake.  Wow.  But since Im already way too far iinto this conversation I might as well use it as a learning opportunity because youre obviously the person to educate me on this what would have been be an example of response from me to your first comment which would not have caused the conversation to deteriorate into the most asinine Ive seen so far in an art discussion forum?Were you expecting me to thank you for your insight and wisdom and defer to your opinion on who has the best take on how to look at art and congratulate you on your unique paraphrasing of a recently deceased artists opinion on art...because Im sure an exact quotation would have taken too much effort to Google?Was I supposed to be impressed with your amazing vocabulary more or less correctly using a word like didactic in a sentence bonus points for rhyming with infographic!.Or do you just like bullying newbies?

1405550,0,t1_cisgid9,gt No it doesnt  It might do if the analogy was to practicing art  as in practicing law or having a clinical practice  But we are talking about appreciating art not being an artist.Then why are we not discussing individual artistartworks that you might or might not have enjoyed? Why are you talking and in a way attacking the entire contemporary art field? Anyone is free to enjoy art this is a given. But you are not talking about enjoying an artwork. Youre dismissing an entire profession as fraudsters. All Im saying is that without some knowledge on the subject its difficult to participate in the discussion.gt My question was about the trend of simplicity  with no judgement on quality other than that there seems to be in fine arts and in music and in architecture and etc  a trend towards simplicity or at least more simple works of art. Is there a consensus on why that is? Here is a perfect example of what I mean. First you state there is a trend of simplicity matter of fact like. I already have trouble with this seeing as trends are difficult in the multifacetted artworld of today. What is simplicity? What is a more simple work of art? Are we talking aesthetics? Conceptually simple? Is a minimalist sculpture say by Donal Judd a more simple artwork that a baroque painting?I believe with simplicity you actually meant to say work that required less effort to be conceived is that correct? ,ContemporaryArt,cisgru8,5,t5_2s6lg

2247902,0,t1_clpjzdr,gt Yea this argument has been flying around since like the fifties. The most overt problem is the dogma that womens problems arent interesting and that women need to start making big masculine work to be taken seriously that weaving and textiles arent as interesting in comparison to big sploogy maledominated abstraction.I dont mean it like that. I think any medium should be taken seriously whether it be stereotypically feminine or masculine. Weaving and textiles can be interesting but I dont think Grabner is doing anything interesting with it. Thats more the lack of any message than her choice of medium in my opinion.gt Grabner is doing the exact opposite of grandiose big work. Intentionally. and claiming that as valid. Johnson fell into her trap if anything. Grabner used to introduced herself as a midcareer middle class Midwestern artist who make mediocre paintings. This is a pretty radical position to take in an artworld where everyone is trying to be the most eurocentric erudite globalnomad curators quoting Tiquuin geniuses. I take Johnsons critique as critique on her lack of message not a critique of her medium or presentation. The voice she chose is all perfectly fine but if youve really got nothing to say with that voice then whats the point? Id think her art would be equally bad if it were some grandiose sculpture and Ive read Johnsons critique as saying just that.gt Grabner makes the radical assertion that soccer moms are perfectly capable of making valid art and not merely in the malebigabstraction style.I dont think thats very radical. I think thats very politically correct actually. And so far she hasnt proved her point to me.,ContemporaryArt,clpk7ob,1,t5_2s6lg

2535343,0,t3_2oq5ej,Im a practicing artist working mostly in drawing and sculpture using abstraction to look at psychological effects to trauma and emotion. Im also interested in societal decisions to undermine one area to profit another this is broad and goes across city planning environmental issues etc as well as for individuals pursuing career over family or love over wealth etc. These are all intrinsically linked to my own questions about what we are doing here and how we forge meaning.

5738818,0,t1_cx7ra1f,Whites are colonialists. The societies in which we are others we have often turned up in boats with weapons and claimed their lands as our own. Slaughtering untold amounts in the process and ingratiating ourselves forcefully into the culture on the assumption that we know better.Thats white identity to a postcolonialist. Its why people take offense to white Americans wearing Native American headdresses because their ancestors came and killed off as much of the native population as possible and are now recycling their culture as something to get drunk in.What we conquered informed our imagination thus our identity is that of the conqueror. We romanticised that which we tried to conquer and fetishised their culture. Contextualise Picassos interest in the primitive African artworks that were in museums against French interventions in Africa. Orientalist painting against the British and French activities in the Ottoman Empire amidst its decline.I dont know what a modern White identity would entail in part because I think the modernist and postmodernist projects of idealist humanism and erosion of formal cultural boundaries which Id tag as White projects arent conducive to that being thought about seriously and the only people Im aware of thinking about it and publishing have swastika tattoos. If anybody is reading this and has recommendations on academic texts exploring this subject I would absolutely love to see them. ,ContemporaryArt,cx8gfxu,5,t5_2s6lg

7321212,0,t1_d29c4nl,I think thats kind of the joke or maybe even the point. These works are not attempting to be purely nonanthropocentric but rather illustrate the idea that there are objects that exist without a relationship to humans whatsoever. The works simply ask us to consider that idea especially when the works employ certain elements that bear no relationship to us the crabs.    It would be absurd to try and produce an artwork that bore no relationship to humans purely nonanthropocentric because art is inherently so. But thats not what theyre doing. ,ContemporaryArt,d2addok,1,t5_2s6lg
