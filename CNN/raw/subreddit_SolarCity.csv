2831841,0,t1_cnpv41a,Technically you dont. If the system isnt producing what we say it should its a major problem for us. We would reimburse you the money for the electricity you had to use from your former utility. Were not in the business of writing checks so if we see a dip in your production we will fix it. Thats why we only install on homes with an internet connection so we can monitor it remotely. To avoid the hassle just hose it off now and then.,SolarCity,cnpz4pg,2,t5_2worq
3431411,0,t3_2zj817, The job description is Carpenter but the description sounds like an installer. I guess wages are different from region to region but I was wondering what the pay might be. The location is  mins at best from me. Not that great compared to my  minute commute currently for work. But I figure Ill be driving distances if I worked here anyways since its the only location in the state currently. Supposedly Solarcity and the solar industry  as a whole are expanding and creating a ton of jobs. I could see them expanding into another closer city down the road. As far as the job I think Id thrive at installing solar panels and that Im more than qualified for the job. I think its pretty obvious that solar is the future with lots of room to grow. Any thoughts?Edit I think I might apply just to learn more and see if its something I should pursue.  Im currently a custodian at an elementary school were the pay is decent great benefits. Easy and stress free mostly but boring and stagnate as far as job growth. Would love to create something beneficial to the communitybe outside different place each day.       ,SolarCity,cpjenpq,1,t5_2worq

If you just ride the wave of popular stocks then yeah its pretty much gambling. ,SolarCity,d0nene5,1,t5_2worq

7492121,0,t3_4hzz9g,I personally have been doing some additional restocking of SolarCity stocks in recent days but not too much to hurt my overall portfolio. Im obviously hoping on a recovery in the coming weeks. Well see though Im definitely not a analyst of any sort.,SolarCity,d2ttaro,1,t5_2worq
7909784,0,t1_d451h8f,Better is relative. Its different. FES is marketinglead gen while FEC is sales  though I dont look at my job as being a salesperson however.It just depends on you and what youre comfortable with. I dont know how its like out there but if the hiring manager thought you would be a good candidate for FEC right out the gate she most likely wouldve offered it. FEC has more freedom but you definitely need to have more drive as well to succeed.,SolarCity,d454usn,2,t5_2worq
7910902,0,t3_4njl1d,Also FECs in the area have been known to not show up to houses and not close anything if i remember correctly they had a pizza we are sorry tour where they went to a few different stores apologizing to the FESs and what not. The company will blame fess for not hitting a certain amount of Cws. You can do  opps a month and get  closes and its YOUR FAULT that you didnt close them or the always fun to hear you didnt put quality opps thru Its called an opportunity not a guarantee. ,SolarCity,d459dhp,0,t5_2worq
8106518,0,t1_d4r8ks7,Look its fine to be wrong. Im wrong a lot. But at least have some intellectual honesty with yourselfgtSolarCity is a panel manufacturer.gtThey will be more so when the GF in Bufallo is running.See thats info I didnt know.  efficiency would indicate virtually no reason to try to integrate for physics so that is good to know. I suspected it was a mature technology but that pretty much confirms it. The rest comes down to  as you indicate  size and cost considerations.The outsized benefits of owning solarcity at the price indicated for the merger far outweigh the business synergies between teslasolarcity. Some benefits will exist  using the direct sales outlets to tesla customers to get them signed up for solar batteries offered by package deal rather than through a partnership  but the bulk of the return will be tied to solarcitys growth that would have occurred in an independent solarcity not returns that are created through integration.,SolarCity,d4r8ucd,1,t5_2worq
