4914422,0,t1_cudzvng,I guess it comes down to preference. I like tasigur better granted I play with thought scour. For me he has out performed goyf.Edit  fixed spelling error,ModernTwin,cue00h3,0,t5_39lu1
5687684,0,t3_3sa2b7,The biggest change you can make is just switching your perceived role in the matchup.  They have an abundance of hate for the combo in  Rending Volley and  Natures Claims. Cutting some of the combo by going to  Pestermite  Exarch  Twin or something is totally reasonable. Alter your flex slots to be more proactive and durdle less.  Dispel is a little overkill and the nd Cryptic Command has looked worse and worse. Add in a couple Grim Lavamancers or a second Clique. Aim to race them. Id say if they want to fill up their deck with reactive answers post board keep in all your Bolts Grim Lavamancers and consider running one or two Thundermaw Hellkites in your sideboard. In general the longer the game goes on the less likely you are to win.,ModernTwin,cx2423f,0,t5_39lu1
6030896,0,t1_cy9xaiz,Hmmm...well no one ever really referred to it as groundbreaking but heres a quick breakdown of the split of noTasigur vs. Tasigur Grixis Twin lists that have T larger events SCG Premiere IQsOpensClassics GP OKC MODO PTQ RPTQs etc since SeptemberSeptember  Tas  noTasOctober  Tas  noTasNov  Tas  noTasDec  Tas  noTas Andrew Tenjum won SCG Classic LV w noTas version Rudy B. takes to Players Champ.Not to say the noTasigur version was never in existence.  For example Rudy Briksza has never been a fan of Tasigur and has piloted the Tasigurless version as far back as July.  You will also find that PVDDR similarly is not a fan opting for the Tasigurless version for the Modern portion of the World Champs.  So its been out there in a very limited presence but the vast majority of lists as illustrated above have heretofore contained Tasigur until Tenjums victory in LV.Regarding the value of Tasigur in Twin...that was never really my question.  I asked peoples opinions of noTasigur Grixis vs. standard UR.  Those are the only two in my consideration set.  I would never play Tasigur in Twin.  The real reason to splash black is for removal not for Tasigur...this is why Patrick Dickmann immediately moved off of Grixis Twin w Tasigur after basically creating it  PT Fate Reforged and just went with Harvest Pyre in UR instead of Grixis w Terminate.,ModernTwin,cya62pq,3,t5_39lu1
6031880,0,t3_3y3ogk,Probably run another Jace... ur bringin in jace against most of the same matchups as keranos... if ur not running clique mb then I would run that also...,ModernTwin,cyaaosk,2,t5_39lu1
6185521,0,t3_409wpu,If youre running Teferi and to a lesser extent Keranos out of the side it is  advised. EoT Tefferi off of Cavern will win you  of you Blue based matchups. Forcing Keranos through is nice too. I actually think  is fine in UR. Its a pseudo colored land and you can almost never go wrong naming Wizard esspecially if you run Clique.,ModernTwin,cysq9pz,1,t5_39lu1
6250683,0,t3_41703s,In the interest of competitive diversity. I have no idea what bullshit kind of reasoning is this but its done. Oh well. I guess Ill flock to delver until I can afford JVPs for Grixis.I think the message is very clear  always hope your Modern pet deck doesnt become tier  because they will ban it just to hype up the pro tour.,ModernTwin,cz04vs6,17,t5_39lu1
6251636,0,t3_41703s,Just bought my play set of Splinter Twin today too. So tilting. ,ModernTwin,cz08sbb,6,t5_39lu1
