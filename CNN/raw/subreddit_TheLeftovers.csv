1355166,0,t3_29jwxa,Watched the first episode but also read the book recently! Definitely dont think the show gave many reasons to care about these characters but the book started similarly. As it progressed there was a slow reveal of many characters lives before and after the sudden departure that gave everyone more depth and reason to care! I think a few episodes from now itll be quite a bit better!,TheLeftovers,cim5ssk,2,t5_2uebb
1359124,0,t3_29nd8b,Couldnt agree more. Im really not sure why the premiere got such a generally cold reception. The wtf moments and missing explanations are there for a reason gave a good glimpse of what to expect and really set up the series nicely.

1570798,0,t3_2c5bos,I think the scene with the car was showing the tendency for people to take chance occurrence as destiny or a sign.

1598550,0,t3_2cljpg, I was much more up in the air regarding Waynes powers before last night. Guest removed almost any notion from my mind that Waynes power is supernatural. All he did was talk it out and give her a hug something she direly needed but wouldnt allow anyone to do for her. Theres still some weird shit going on so Im not ruling it out but Wayne seemed much more like a normal man last night.  All we have seen is testimony so far in regards to Waynes power. The prophesied time of reckoning has not yet happened. Id reckon it will begin with the birth of his child. We just dont know what will come of his prophecy. Im leaning towards nothing. You make a great point about whats controlling things under the surface what with Matts luck Kevins dogs and Garvey Sr.s voices in his head. Whether this ever materializes into something concrete is anyones guess.,TheLeftovers,cjgnzv7,6,t5_2uebb

1872241,0,t3_2g0zni,. I think Laurie will leave the GR if only because there doesnt seem to be many of them left in Mapleton. I dont think she will reunite with her family though her last moment with Kevin wasnt exactly a warm one hes clearly angry that Jill almost got killed as a result of the GRs campaign. She may possibly leave town with Tommy if he was planning on staying I doubt hed have left the baby on the doorstep.. Nora and Kevin will raise the baby together thats what the last scene of the finale implied to me anyway. I dont think it matters what Tommy thinks as I doubt hell be around that much.. Christine wasnt abducted she ran off. The bag she left behind was a diaper bag so Tom could take care of the baby. The baby was left behind because Christine was abandoning it.. I hope the next season doesnt explain the Departure as the whole underpinning of this season was about not understanding and not knowing. I dont think we will get answers and I think thats great. Character Development isnt a theme its just something any good story does and the Garveys havent completely overcome The Departure. They just got some small glimmer of hope. I dont think having exhausted the book means they have to go mystic as plenty of stuff in the show wasnt even in the book so I think they have the potential to tell more stories.Also I dont think theyll have different themes next season most shows have their preoccupations that they stay with their whole run. Breaking Bad was always about Greed and Pride and Power for all of its seasons.The most likely source of new plot would be the aftermath of the pogroms in Mapleton.,TheLeftovers,ckesr1p,6,t5_2uebb

1910202,0,t1_ckig0n3,i think the only question is wether he believes himself to have powers or not which from what i took away from the show he does. we obviously see norah lose her depression after hugging dwayne however it comes back when she sees the dolls. therefore i think dwaynes power is really just an honest approach at showing people that life can continue if youre willing to try. his hug is a manifestation of human nature which everyone seems to have lost since the departure. everyones trying to find an answer to why their loved ones departed but nobody is really trying to help one another carry on theyre simply just grieving together. dwayne is willing to extend his hand for a fee but he is a crook... and let people feel human again. its like his hug relieves their numbness. but again it all depends on wether or not you think dwayne is exploiting people or genuinely trying to help. i mean why would he admit to thinking hes a fraud then extend himself to kevin? i think he really wants to be who he says he is,TheLeftovers,ckjd88g,1,t5_2uebb

5425248,0,t1_cw4ygqo,A few things Im thinking of in response to this. Patti certainly felt the GR had a purpose. During the cabin scene towards the end of season  she lays out pretty clearly her beliefs and one can extend the beliefs of the GR as a whole. They put meaning into the Departure and not only trivial meaning but ALL meaning. To them the Departure is the only thing that matters and so they remove all aspects of their lives except the departure. They smoke as a symbol of the pointlessness of continuing to live because they believe something is coming that will make their lives irrelevant. They wear white to make themselves indistinguishable from one another. As a whole they refuse to move on from the departure because to them the departure is quite literally the end all be all of life. So they remove all aspects of their lives that dont have to do with the Departure. On the GR knowing or not knowing something about the departure. In the episode The Garveys at their best towards the end Kevin is sitting at the side of the road smoking a cigarette on the morning of the departure. A car drives down the road and stops in front of him and inside are a bunch of people all wearing white and acting strange. Its just a moment but the viewer is definitely supposed to at least suspect that these people are a kind of precursor GR who may know something of whats to come. The GRs insistence that the departure has meaning is central to the point this show is attempting to make. To me there are three different people in the post departure world. People that attribute all meaning to the departure the GR Kevins Dad to an extent the palm reader guy from Jarden Noras brother those who attribute exactly zero meaning to the departure and view it as simply random andor unknowable John from Jarden arguably Laurie now and finally those who are on the fence the majority of the characters kevin jill nora perhaps Tom and Johns wife and daughter. Whats kind of amazing is that these three categories of people exists in the exact same way in our real world. You have the extreme religious you have the staunch atheists and then you have the majority of people in between. The Departure is the writers way of exaggerating these beliefs to tell us about ourselves and our searches for meaning. To show us that we arent living in a world too removed from the world of the leftovers for we dont have the answers either. Because at the end of the day the Leftovers is a show about the struggle of finding personal meaning in a SEEMINGLY random and unknowable universe. The events in the show have cast a die of doubt across the world and now everyone left over is forced to reconcile that doubt and create purpose for themselves without relying on the luxury of certainty. ,TheLeftovers,cw54r4i,15,t5_2uebb

5527131,0,t1_cwhgkgk,Technically Jarden doesnt have to be that special. The SD involved  of the worlds population. On average a town with a population of  would have had about  people depart.Except we can observe that many places were hit harder than others. Im not sure if we were ever told what the population of Mapleton is the real Mapleton NY is a hamlet with around  or so but the TVs Mapleton seems bigger but it seems like just about every family had at least one departure suggesting they got hit much higher than the average. And this season the MIT researchers buying Noras house seem to confirm the wide variance.Its not unreasonable to think that more than one small town with less than  people could have very few or no departures. Or Jarden might be the only publicized city in the US with no departures although they certainly seem to have some secrets theyre not sharing but many other may have only had one or two.Its also possible the writers havent really thought out the statistics that their own writing has implied.,TheLeftovers,cwi51p1,2,t5_2uebb

Because we are an intelligent life form then yes the rest all does come along with it. But youre right in a sense that I think it may be just as instinctual as eating and reproducing. Our early ancestors looked to the stars. Questioning what that big burning ball in the sky was. What the star formations at night meant. What the acts of mother nature meant. I guess what I was just saying was that were no more special than any other animal here. Just because we can question our own reality doesnt mean its a part of our survival.

5687241,0,t3_3t0dsq,Thus far the show repeatedly reminds us that the only documented supernatural event that occurred was the departure.  Everything else has eventually been explained away using logic  science based rationale.    I thought it was a very powerful scene when Laurie explained very clearly to Kevin that he was in fact just a nutcase like his father.  That scene completed Kevins story.  All the potential demontheories involving Patty came to a crashing halt.  There was nothing supernatural going on.  Kevin just had a Tyler Durden moment.  Instead of shooting himself like Edward Norton did in Fight Club he drank the poison.  I think Kevin is dead.  If he does return it would be something along the lines of how Patty returned this season.  There is nowhere else for his character to grow otherwise.So that leaves the only major unexplained event  the girls disappearance.  For several episodes we were being led to believe that they may have in fact departed.  Then the doubt began to creep in when Nora and Regina had their conflict.  Now with creepy Michael amp Virgil creeping around doing creepy things we may be heading to another story arc of their involvement with the girls.The motives are unclear although I suspect something downright sinister but I would not be surprised to see Michael bury Kevin right next to where he had previously buried the girls.,TheLeftovers,cx222rj,1,t5_2uebb

Kevin jumped into the water to die and virgil said his powerful adversary must of drained the lake. Virgil knows where his grandaughter and her friends went missing from so its possible to believe that he blames kevins adversary and therefor kevin for the disappearance of the girls.And what I said is if Old Man Garvey ever said anything about the trip then it is  percent magic. Also suspending disbelief is harder for some than it is for others  its an important skill but its basically how much bullshit can you take to enjoy this story?.

Doesnt make sense. It makes more sense that he laid Kevin outside to help him outside the presence of his dead grandfather and try to resuscitate him. But then why wouldnt he call for help? Why wouldnt he contact the Garveys? Maybe he just assumed Kevin was dead and was praying over him? Just seems like a guy as innocent and goodnatured as Michael wouldve done something more proactive about he situation.So yeah Id assume the reaction was more in line with shock that the plan actually worked.

He put out a newsletter about all the shitty things people who departed did  the point being that the selection of the people who disappeared was totally random. They werent saved.

Indeed Nora instantly bonds with the baby but not because she is waiting for it shes not connected with HW or the GR. The last scene thematically mirrors he experience on Oct th and represents a turning point in her healing process. One the day of the departure Nora wished she could escape the burden of her family only to turn around and have them vanish. This sends her on the journey leading to the rd anniversary of Oct th. After the events of S Nora is convinced that she is basically cursed and that the only thing left for her to do is accept responsibility for causing her familys departure.  She decides to cut herself off from everyone she cares about to protect them. Right at her lowest moment she turns to see a baby who needs here which appears to be meant for her. She says Look what I found to mean she found her sign that she isnt cursed and that she cant live the rest of her live blaming herself.

It concealed it or always gave an alternate explanation to allow the viewer to put themselves in Kevins shoes. Always answering it with some logic. But we slowly see that even Kevin even John have come around to not understanding whats happening. Because there isnt always an answer. ,TheLeftovers,cxqpe4u,2,t5_2uebb

5950285,0,t3_3wclkc,Just something Ive been thinking about  I realized that the Guilty Remnant are the primary antagonists tonight for one reason.  Theyre not trying to get people to remember theyre just trying to hurt people.  This might seem obvious to everyone and its something I figured was obvious but I mean it in contrast to everyone else so far.  Everyone else isnt ignoring what happened the way that the GR wants us to believe.  Theyre coping.  Theyre looking for answers.  Theyre grieving and theyre moving on and theyre wallowing and theyre just okay with it and many other things.  But no ones really ignoring what happened.  You cant.  It was a massive worldwide event.  It happened and everyone did what we all do  they acknowledged it and kept going in whatever way they could.The members of the GR all have something in common for one reason or another they cant just deal with it and move on they have to make people suffer.  They cant deal with their pain.  And unlike others who cant deal with their pain and lash out in various personal ways the GR specifically focus their pain onto others.  If we have to suffer then were going to make sure other people suffer too.  Thats their real mission statement.The main group cant even own up to that truth either.  They have to be the ultimate passive aggressive douchebags and stand around silently judging while technically not disturbing people even though they know theyre doing just that...they just cant be arrested for it.  That so many people break and react is the whole point.  The wallow in their misery with their smoking and silence.  That so many break the silence without consequence is evidence enough that its just an arbitrary flagellation.  Wah Im so miserable.  And then they take that selfgenerated misery and they turn it on everyone else because Wah if Im going to suffer so are you.  Be sad with me assholes.  Its petty and its pathetic.Meg and her splinter group take it to another level.  They arent just going to make people miserable passively theyre going to take what they see as a happy untouched people and actively ruin their lives.  Were not going to wait for you to snap and get miserable with us were going to bring the misery TO you.  Boo hoo everyone be sad with us.And the worst part?  They dont even get that the people of Jardin ARE hurting.  Some of them ARE miserable.  Theyre clearly dealing with massive emotional issues.  But all Megs GR sees is a group that avoided the arbitrary Departure and that makes them the big target.  So they took a town that was already hurting and made them even more miserable.  Good job sadboyssadgirls.And thats the point.  The GR are oblivious douchebags.  They hurt people to hurt them telling themselves that only they are ones that are really hurting and that everyone needs to hurt as much as them...and everyones already hurting along with them.  Theyre selfish spoiled emotionally stunted brats.  Everyone else goes through hell or Purgatory to find an answer to their pain and the GR just blindly lashes out like a baby.  Evie poor sad Evie had something happen and now she takes it out on everyone while never actually trying to find a way to help herself.  Just poor me poor Evie Ill show them wah.Meg has massive personal issues guilt because of things that happened around her apparent dissatisfaction with her really great guy fiancee and instead of confronting it she runs off and joins the GR.  Wah Im so miserable so now I can make everyone else miserable wah.Hell Patti actually owned up to this once she was actually dead.  Her husband was a cheater.  And a pervert which whatever thats his thing but she couldnt deal.  And she had a plan to leave...but instead of doing it when she had every opportunity she stayed and continued to be miserable.  And then once Neil died however it is that he died she was free from the man who was her supposed source of misery...and instead joined the GR.  She couldnt blame her misery on someone that was dead now so she had to turn it outward.So I guess the real pointTLDR is this  the GR arent there to show anyone anything.  They arent there to make a statement.  They arent there with any real goal.  Theyre a bunch of people who would rather cause other people to be miserable instead of dealing with their own misery and moving on.  Theyre selfmartyring assholes who live to do nothing but poison the world.  Theyre pretty much the AntiKevin.,TheLeftovers,cxzm24i,15,t5_2uebb

So Season  might have some kind of flavor the Cairo troubled capital of the Arab world and with all that in mind we ask ourselves Have excavations on the island of Thera solved the riddle of the Minoans? which is similar to the overarching theme that well never know what the departure was or meant.

Hell I think overall its the GOAT show. But Season  of the Leftovers was as close to perfect as I have ever seen a show be. Win Writing in a Drama Series International AssassinThere are literally  or  episodes that could have won but International Assassin takes the cake. No other show put out an episode quite as unique interesting captivating and tearinducing as International Assassin. Win Lead Actor in a Drama Series Justin TherouxI usually watch shows with Ensemble casts so best actor is slightly more iffy on me. Still I have a hard time thinking of any other actor who put out a performance as great as Justins. Nominated Lead Actress in a Drama Series Carrie CoonDont even get me started on not even nominating her. What a farce. I think Lena Headey should win for her performance as Cersei Lannister finally getting the credit she deserves but to not even nominate Carrie is an insult to humanity. Nominated Supporting Actor in a Drama Series Christopher Eccelston andor Kevin CarrollIm partial to Christopher but either one would do.

Still they dont care about dying for the cause in the end Gladys didnt flinch when she was told that she needed to die for the cause only when she was being stoned she said Please but that please could have been a End it now more than a cry for help.

10967657,0,t1_de9rqtu,Im sorry but I completely disagree with this sentiment. The Guilty Remnant is an evil insane cult. They stalk and harass people break into peoples homes emotionally torture them with fake versions of their lost loved ones and threaten school buses full of children with grenades. Under no definition can they be defined as the good guys. And you cant even argue that they at least have a good message or goal because the Guilty Remnant has no clear goal to speak of. Just look at their notalking policy. Theyre still allowed to write so it doesnt actually make a difference whether theyre allowed to express ideas verbally. It just makes every conversation exponentially more tedious even among themselves. And their main purpose to be living reminders doesnt make any sense either because there really doesnt seem to be any end game to it. Lets say tomorrow everyone suddenly agrees with the Guilty Remnant. They were right we cant ignore the Departure the world is over life is meaningless! Okay...now what? What is the fruit of their labors? What have them accomplished? Turning everyone into chainsmoking nihilists? You say that they do not tolerate anyone who is faking it pretending or otherwise. Well thats true but why on Earth is that a good thing? Who gives a shit how other people try to cope with tragedy? And why they care? This is I think a fundamental problem with their entire worldview. If the whole point of the Guilty Remnant is that the world has ended and life is pointless now...why do they spend so much fucking time and energy trying to convince other people of that fact? Its an inherent oxymoron like someone whos an extremely passionate activist for apathy and indifference.Essentially the Guilty Remnant is like those people who harass the families of the victims of school shootings because they think its all a government conspiracy. Only theyre worse because they actually do believe that they people they harass have have genuinely suffered loss and then they harass them anyways.,TheLeftovers,deb8iq8,11,t5_2uebb

Wed watch theyd take copious notes then wed discuss.Then when it reaired a few hours later wed rewatch and it was like an entirely new show to them. As the series went on their questions became intriguing fascinating and very introspective.

So many characters on this show make insane decisions that she really shouldnt bother me. But I just find her irritating.

11745574,0,t3_67lgfy,I think its unlikely. Spoilers for Lost up ahead.I think Lindelof and the other writers are trying to create a very distinct experience here which is not to say that the storytelling doesnt recall Lost at times. I think your note about how the second ep recalls the Dharma Initiative is a good observation as youre identifying an aspect of Lindelofs artistic wheelhouse the types of ideas he likes to utilize like clandestine research teams with unusual objectives. However I think the writers are being very careful about the nature of the world in The Leftovers  whats possible what isnt etc. I think they would destroy that project by uniting the two shows. I also think the styles of the two shows are such that dropping Lost into the soup of The Leftovers would create a bad taste.Think about the kind of questions raised by The Leftovers  is the hotel real? Is Kevin a legitimate messiah? Does his father really hear voices? The unique sense of mystery tied to those questions sort of goes out the window if they say all of these people exist in a world where smoke monsters possess corpses and time travel is possible and ghosts exist and...The Leftovers is about a world where something crazy happened and now life seems stranger and there are suggestions of miracles and everythings freighted with magical possibilities. The exciting dance of what if? and whats happening? and wait is that even happening? would kind of lose some of its power if turned out that Nora Durst and Jacob coexist in the same universe. PS  This does not mean that your theory isnt interesting l think its worthwhile to think about the two shows and the links between them. I think youre enthusiastically engaging with the show and trying to chase down clues which is great. I just respectfully disagree that Lost and The Leftovers share the same world and I think that such a development would hinder Lindelofs new show for various reasons.,TheLeftovers,dgre2hb,7,t5_2uebb

11754156,0,t3_67nr7k,This argument to me IS the point of the show. The Sudden Departure demonstrated that magical surreal spiritual things ARE possible. And those that remain and Im including show viewers here have to find a way to make sense of it  of course that was always going to include skeptics and believers in the shows universe AND ours,TheLeftovers,dgsd2xz,6,t5_2uebb
11754658,0,t3_67nr7k, Youre not addressing several possibly supernatural occurrences that defy explanation. Like Matts wife coming out of her coma with perfect recall Kevin being buried for  hours or the SD itself.  You are of course mostly right. Part of the shows strength is that the only truly supernatural event that defies any explanation is the SD itself. Everything else could be coincidence or psychosis. But thats kind of the idea. What do people do when confronted with the tragic and inexplicable? We sort of know what happens from history  at a time when science wasnt really a thing people turned to superstition. They listened to hucksters and false profits. They formed cults and conducted witch hunts. But its rare that anything today truly defies explanation. Certainly nothing that is concrete or tangible  almost every recorded natural phenomenon can be explained. Part of the shows premise is what if something happened that was undeniably supernatural? How would people react to that? Well they start turning to superstition listen to false profits form cults and start hunting witches. Im glad the show doesnt take too heavy a hand with it either. Keep having the supernatural occur and it becomes less special. We start to see patterns and rules and it begins to feel more natural. At any rate I think youre correct that most of the supernatural occurrences in the show arent and can be explained in some way. The SD itself might have been some insanely unlikely event like a targeted gamma ray burst. But that doesnt seem that different to me from magic. And at any rate thats not really the point. The show is about people not the events they respond to. ,TheLeftovers,dgsf4wj,2,t5_2uebb

Kevin isnt seeing Patti and isnt nearly as guiltridden and selfdestructive as he was but now he has PTSD from the hotel and is chasing that feeling of dangercumvibrancy.  Nora is finding that just being with Kevin isnt enough to make her feel as if shes not cursed.Matt however...hes in a worse place because we didnt consider what Mary wanted.  She was an object in the first two seasons not a character.  Now that shes a character we see that her and Matt dont see eye to eye.  Thats a normal thing that happens.It sounds like you think the season  finale was the perfect ending and this seems tacked on like rehashing old ground their development.
