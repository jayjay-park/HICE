7750192,1,t1_d3n3wk1,Before each sale I crosscheck with vendors to make sure my prices are reasonable. I try to get a  markup on iHavCoH prices unless the cigars Im selling are HTF from FoH or aged. Since iHav doesnt have these in stock Im using CoHs price as a baseline. The price for an entire box there is  or . per stick. I am selling them at  which I think is more than fair given the fact that theyre from a  box.Even if I managed to find the box for  I dont see how thats any of your concern given that the price that Im selling them for now is more than reasonable. You cant say that Im selling at a  markup if the cigars cant be found for the price that youre speculating I bought them.If you have a problem with my pricing then explain whats wrong with it. Dont just throw your hands in the air and say something along the lines of these were on sale somewhere. Convince me that the price Im selling at right now is too high and then Ill lower it and preferably with some links to vendors.,CigarMarket,d3n512x,1,t5_2x7l6

So in a way Im not verified.Does that mean Im not a trust worthy seller? rtraderfeedback seems to. Dictate otherwise.rcigars and rcigarmarket have no affiliation if youve noticed. So while I understand it makes you feel better to only deal with verified members it also makes sense to check trader feedback since it tells you a lot more than a plus or bomb sign ever will.There are many verified members who I would never purchase from but continue to be verified. Reasons  poor packaging and shitty turn around time. You may even find some of that in traderfeedback as well.Good luck with your search.,CigarMarket,d8j6nzt,-5,t5_2x7l6
