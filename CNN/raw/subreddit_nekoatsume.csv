4578591,0,t1_ct7pzlj,Manzokusan eats food only from the outside. I am sorry if Im telling you something you know already but there is no need to refill the bowl when Manzokusan is eating. He will go away on his own when he is finished eating it can take some time up to one hour or more even. The bowl looks empty but thats deceptive. If you take away the bowl before he has finished eating i.e. replace it immediately when he comes he will not be generous with the fish he gives you. If you leave him alone to eat he will usually give you large amounts of sardines in return. ampnbspTLDR  dont change the food until Manzokusan leaves the game on his own. ,nekoatsume,ct7qjf7,5,t5_37ssh

Just the same  cats who are lovely but stingy with those fishies!! xx,nekoatsume,d1o7ggb,3,t5_37ssh
7127640,0,t3_4d6nvy,Ive been having great luck lately with gold fish  I just switched to the candy theme yard and Im using the new items. However it can be really hard to start off with getting gold fish. I definitely recommend keeping the Beach Umbrella and Green Cushion. I also highly recommend the Yellow Cube for gold fish as well. Forget the fancy food just get the Frisky Bitz for now so youre not wasting your gold fish.I also highly HIGHLY recommend getting the Zanzibar Cushion worth the gold as it will net you  silver fish a day plus the odd gold fish from Xerxes IV which will make it a lot easier to do a silver to gold fish swap.I did this for  weeks and got myself the yard expansion.,nekoatsume,d1oby75,9,t5_37ssh

9554072,0,t1_d9qot45,Haha the paper and plastic bag are my favorites because I thought they were so silly! Spooky became my favorite cat because he was the first for me to play with those items and I thought his name was fitting. If he plays with them any longer hell definitely be spooky...The Tower of Treats would probably be my least favorite. Its just not a good prop for pictures. Only the top tier looks nice.

9818761,0,t3_5fqcer,Microtransactions are a major turnoff for most people myself included. Theres a difference between buying merch and buying virtual stuff in the game that are in the grand scheme of things just a bunch of pixels. One of the things I like about Neko Atsume is that the game doesnt force you to buy anything  sure the option is still there for those interested  but you can spend zero money on it and still get the most enjoyment out of the app. Id rather support the game developers by buying official merch planning to buy all  bandai figurine sets and will do.,nekoatsume,daneiph,1,t5_37ssh

10069723,0,t3_5jt64f,Its more than that iinm because there are several small items that can attract  cats like the giant cushion and the lacquered bowl and the luxury treasure box. If you hypothetically use both the tower of treats and the cat condo complex thats  cats spots each and that leaves you  free spots so if you hypothetically use those  goodies thats  cats each and  other spots for goodies that can hold  cat and if Tubbs and WhiteShadow hypothetically show up for the food thatll be  total. Edit I forgot about the cubes and the wood stump  since those can hold  cats as well so its actually  cats in total that you can hypothetically have in your yard at a given time,nekoatsume,dbk3voj,2,t5_37ssh

10489602,0,t3_5q85qu,After weeks of frustration wondering why I had only seen him once and missed him about  times I discovered the best way to attract whiteshadow is to set out sashimi inside and deluxe tuna outside. After about two visits he stops visiting as frequently unless you switch to another remodel. So if I miss him twice I will switch to a new background and wait for him to show up there. Now I see him often! My apologies if this has already been shared here several times already.,nekoatsume,dcx3ub9,14,t5_37ssh
