9277765,0,t3_57hn2t,xpost from rchess where I didnt realize they were so super serious about the traditional game.anyway I hope those of you with iOS devices check this out because competing on the leaderboards is a ton of fun. im someone who loves the strategy of chess but dont feel super inclined to learn all the classic openings and moves that are semiguaranteed to work based off positioning. this soft reboot of the game for me has improved my enjoyment of chess like tenfold.figured id mention it here. ,chessvariants,d8s0us8,1,t5_2u91f
10382264,0,t3_5m9pqv,I really like a chess variant called SHUURO. Its played on a x board with randomized obstacles only Knights can climb. Each piece costs a certain amount and each player secretly buys and army with predetermined points. After purchasing armies terrain is generated then players fill in the back ranks first. It had a  player expansion called TURANGA. It didnt sell very well so it may be a little hard to find. I got my copy from a war game website years ago. I cant remember the name of the site. If you do find it it plays well with a card expansion for chess called KNIGHTMARE CHESS if youre interested.It was reimplemented into a game called LOKA which came with less but cost more encouraging buying more than one set. ,chessvariants,dckw6qh,1,t5_2u91f
