He caught the ball which is great but his hold on the baby was precarious when he stood up and I think most good dads instinct would be to cover the baby if the ball came near not try to catch the ball while trying to feed the baby with one arm by holding the baby up with its own arms letting his feet swing around and kick. Yeah it turned out okay but it was a risky move.And this isnt really very nice but I really hated his shiteating grin after it happened and he was still holding the baby pretty poorly. I was like dude pay attention to your kid.It didnt really bother me that he made his team take an out. The baseman was almost certain to catch it anyway so whatever.,DadReflexes,cx5rkf5,3,t5_31wlf

He started choking and my daughter  years old was calmly calling my wife to come over and deal with it although my wife was talking to me and did that yeah ok whatever thing towards her. My wife got up to see what she wanted because my daughter wasnt panicking or explaining the situation in a way that made it the emergency that it was. And thats when shit hit the fan. She started screaming for my son to spit it out!! lol ok yeah Im sure he would have babe if he could which caught my attention immediately. I ran over and kneeled behind him and started the Heimlich Maneuver.Thankfully he ended up coughing up the hot dog. He cried as soon as he gained his breathe and I dont think I ever held him as hard as I did that day. Choking is scary. ,DadReflexes,dd7vfv8,6,t5_31wlf

This is the exact moment of impact the ball is touching the guys hand in this frame. It is clearly above and to the left of the kids face. The ball would have kept going in the direction of the mans elbow if it hadnt been blocked. The kids head is clearly lower and to the right of the path of the ball.You can clearly see it even without the still frame. Watch the gif again focusing on the guys arm instead of on the kid. I dont know why people in this sub arent seeing it.Edit Its irritating how stupid most Redditors are. The gif is in slomo for fucks sake.
