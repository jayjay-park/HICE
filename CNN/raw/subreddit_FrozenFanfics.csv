2082975,0,t1_cl4l2bf,Well yeah. Ill give you some advice not criticism on how you should write your story honestly I dont even trust myself that well but on what I observed so far that can increase the chance of your fanfic to accumulate view counts.I noticed that commonly even though some have really crappy writing Elsanna fanfics have the great amount of follows esp. the Modern!AU G!p Dark!Version Femslash Selfhurt and the likes.So what Im saying is sometimes even though your writing is really good pairing and genres do have a great effect on it.I first wrote a Belsa fanfic and the response was positive but not that shall I say followed enough. Then I started  Elsanna fanfics and the responses were obviously greater than my first fic.Also the time and day of posting of chapter have an effect to the view counts. I noticed that if I post a chapter on Monday and Tuesday in the evening California timezone for some unknown reason the view counts are more than when I post during Friday or Saturday. I believed youre located somewhere in UTC timezone since youre still awake.Also if you put cliffhangers at the end of every chapter which is a sin of mine it have some effect too.These are the things that may help you increase your view counts. And as a friendly reminder write the story you want to tell and dont let the reviewers affect you. It happened to me and until now I havent continue one of the story I made bec. some of the reviewers said that the direction of the story is not what they wanted it to go which dismayed me a lot.Good luck!,FrozenFanfics,cl4lb8g,3,t5_3146i
2593763,0,t1_cmw69e1,gt So after I saw Frozen random ideas for stories naturally started popping in my head.high five!,FrozenFanfics,cmx54cf,2,t5_3146i
2594074,0,t1_cmx58ib,At home.Ive never taken any writing classes besides the required ones at school and those probably do more harm than good.When I was young probably about  I started creating these crazy nonsense stories in my head. I couldnt physically write well But I dont like to think of myself as a writer but rather a storyteller so I would tell my Mom these crazy stories and she would write them down. Then I took the pages and drew pictures on it. It was crazy and the stories were probably awful I dont actually remember what they were about but they taught me the value of creating a proper story arc and planning ahead.My real writing career started when I was in second grade. My teacher gave us all a  page spiral notebook and told us to write in it when we were bored or done with work. She never checked it. I was admittedly an intelligent elementaryschooler so I would often finish my work early and have plenty of time to sit at my desk and do nothing. I dont remember when it happened. One day I took out that notebook and started writing. I got addicted. I filled up that entire notebook and got another one. Filled that one up. It kept going... People would marvel at the length of my scribbled stories. Other kids didnt know how I did it. But it was easy for me. It was fun.I was never a serious writer until high school. That was when I started to read some really good classics  books that caught my attention and inspired me to pursue becoming a better writer. The most important of these was Lord of the Rings. I loved the epic story the attention to detail and the prose used by Tolkien.But I didnt know how to do it. From here I began my lifelong struggle with writing style and prose. I read articles on the internet. I read works by famous writers. I found that the real story wasnt in the words you use but how you use them. How the sentences flow. How the words compliment the story and how the story compliments the words.I still dont consider myself a good writer  I have nothing published yet  but I think I am getting there. I got to where I am because I wrote all the time. I read all the time. I read good books and I read bad books and I found things that worked and I found things that didnt work. I started writing stories at home. Then I would decide that my story was awful throw it out and get started with the next one. Write edit get feedback repeat. And never never never never never never give up. Thats how you become a decent writer.,FrozenFanfics,cmx6l0d,2,t5_3146i

2973017,0,t1_co5noz6,Its basically a series of oneshots showing the more childish side of Elsa. Id recommend it its funny!,FrozenFanfics,co61pxe,1,t5_3146i
2996771,0,t3_2ugrd1,In the last few chapters Anna mentioned that she knew what she did and was pleased with harming Elsa.  This goes against the Anna we knew the entire length of the story.   So my question is was the idea that she enjoyed harming Elsa really Edmunds but she couldnt realize it  or did Anna really enjoy what she did? ,FrozenFanfics,co8m2pa,1,t5_3146i

4505170,0,t1_csygsai,gtDid she succeed in bedding Eirik.spoiler Elsa A Frozen TaleIt happened originally in ch in which Freya!Elsa fully embraces her new body turns into Onion!Elsathe black hair is a homage to her old body and seduces Eirik because shes starved for male companionship. Eirik was far too loyal a subject he found it utterly inappropriate and brushed her off. Hence she turns antagonistic to himmore than the way she does in current ch.spoiler Elsa A Frozen TalegtRegarding Onion!Elsaspoiler Elsa A Frozen TaleNope its not gonna happen anymore. It wouldnt have suited the current storyline of Freya!Elsa trying to be the real Elsa. Onion!Elsa was openly hostile to Anna flirtatious to the males and extremely aggressive and was more than happy to have stolen Elsas body. In short she was a demon in name and personality.spoiler Elsa A Frozen TalegtRegarding the ch endingspoiler Elsa A Frozen TaleI already got backlash over ch so I really am not too worried about more. Rather its because I didnt want to take the easy way out. As you know Im working two jobs so I dont have a lot of time to write. I considered leaving it as ch as a form of escape for myself but decided against it as it wasnt the story I truly wanted to tell. The skeleton and general layout of my fic is already prepared now its a matter of filling in the meat.spoiler Elsa A Frozen TalegtRegarding Elsas deathspoiler Elsa A Frozen TaleTBH its not that I had extended the story its more that I didnt choose to shorten it. The chapter of Elsas death was one thing that stayed fully consistent even from  year ago when I was laying out the groundworks for this story. As for your other point... lets just say its another massive spoiler Id rather not reveal till at least chapter .spoiler Elsa A Frozen TaleAm I on Team Elsa? HELL YES!,FrozenFanfics,csyizux,1,t5_3146i
