3925892,0,t3_35f12u,I was originally going to get a Hakko FXD but I cant afford it at this time. I will not be soldering every day this will be for light electronic work every once in a while. What do you guys think is this an OK alternative?,soldering,cr3sd0n,1,t5_2uj2g

8158684,0,t3_4qb6w2,Board is fine connector is probably shot but I cant really tell from the picture. For  Id personally replace it.I use tweezers while the pad is melted to remove broken pins and other debris then wick to remove the solder from the pad. Youll need to remove all of the solder from all of the pads to get it to sit flush with the board again.Just wash your hands when youre done with leaded solder and the fumes from one job wont kill you.I solder boards in assemblies if Im feeling lazy and I can get to the part without damaging things around it this is personal preference. I recommend you take this one out in this case.When you have everything cleaned up and ready to put back together youll want to wet the side pins of the connector with flux then set it on the pads so the smaller ones are aligned where you want them. Tack one of the side pins with solder then the other remelting them if necessary to align the part get it lined up while only one pad has solder on it. These side pins are meant to hold the part in place and arent as fragile as the actual data pins.That iron is fine. Switch to a kester  flux pen. Get a spool of rosin based solder wick clean the board with alcohol after you wick up solder itll be nasty. Dont buy no clean or no flux wick theyre not beginner friendly. I use Chemtronics personallyPractice practice practice before you attempt this. This isnt a difficult fix but it requires a little bit more into an intermediate level of skill. With that practice board practice only soldering one side of a part down then removing it and cleaning the pad with alcohol and wick. Do this many times until you can do it without ripping the pad off of the board. You dont need to solder both sides to get the skill you need to reattach that connector. To simulate the boardpad clearing you can take the ceramic capacitors solder them down to your practice board by one side then break the part away from the pad with your tweezers. Itll leave behind similar debris to what you will have to deal with on your lvds connector.This is easy enough that Id tell you to bring a pizza with you and Id have it done in ten minutes idk what the deal with the first few shops is maybe liability but the last guy probably saw you come in with a mac and decided to try and rob you lol.Double checked the ebay listing and it is the correct part for you if you actually own a . edit read the other reply  dont even attempt to repair this with hot air youll destroy it.

10689666,0,t1_ddidkmk,well any one of the kits you have posted would work fine it is up to you really but I did notice they sell very similar soldering kits on amazon in the  dollar range that do not have the helping hands but they only cost  dollars. ,soldering,ddik6fh,1,t5_2uj2g
