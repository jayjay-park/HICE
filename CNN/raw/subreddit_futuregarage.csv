829006,0,t1_cgyi88c,Im sorry if you find this out of place. Ive never done this before so I dont know where you got that. This has to do with this subreddit because we plan on showcasing artists that you guys would be interested in. I understand it can seem a bit spammy but you could try to see that were well intentioned in wanting to shed light on cool new music. Thats it. I hope you can respect that  I dont think were harming anything by asking you guys to share your opinions. Market research is a big part of how we please our investors and make the show possible.,futuregarage,cgyid08,-1,t5_2rwqp

9125795,0,t1_d88o4ba,Well its infamous because she played a bunch of songs that wouldnt be typically for an Ibiza crowd. Im talking about Mariah Carey. Spice Girls. Britney. Pop songs basically. It basically was a very unexpected set that bordered on satire and mockery that Boiler Room has never ever released the full video or audio of the mix in contrast to full mixes by other DJs.This is the same event and venue that Carl Cox played at too which has been archived and shown on YouTube.So yeah. Three years since that event. ,futuregarage,d88rsjj,7,t5_2rwqp
