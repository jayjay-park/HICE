3070419,0,t3_2vb82r,Ok people already answered you other questions but I just graduated with my CS degree so I can answer your CS question.I would say our CS program is better then Techs for a few reasons  . Smaller class sizes so there is much more  on  interaction with the professors and thus the classes are a little more catered to how the class is doing as a whole. . Many of the required classes that Radford offers are classes that will be used later in the job market I.E. At least a basic Database class while Tech offers similar classes optionally and very rarely. . Radford has many local tech companies come and present on campus and in classes and talking to people who work there it is very obvious that they choose Radford over Tech. ,radforduniversity,cog8uuq,4,t5_2s4kr
