190846,0,t1_cf0632i,That depends on what is a healthy level of fitness. That could be anything. A common recommendation is  mins of activity every day which is fine if you want to be some average chump with no ambition who will never experience the joy of moving your body at a high performance level.Becoming stronger is one of the most awesome things in the world. Its not just the fact you are stronger or get some more muscle mass but living just becomes easier in general. Coordination is also a big part of becoming stronger and if you do it right you will learn to move better in general which in turn reduces risk of injuries improves posture etc.Becoming stronger has made me look better made me more confident helped me deal with injuries increased performance of movement also things like long distance running and made life easier.Good luck with maintaining a healthy level of fitness!,howto,cf06e03,-4,t5_2qh69

Tall stacks of drawers and shelves are your friend.You may have space under the chassis to build some undercarriage storage I recommend it.Make sure everything you build is possible to clean simply  specifically with regards to being able to sweep under things or alternatively having closed bottoms that dont allow debris in but consider how it might get in from above.A benchcouch should always be able to double as a bed some shelves might also.If its diesel be sure to use a fuel additive like Lucas Upper Cylinder Lubricant or Howes Meaner Power Kleaner with every fill up  those older diesels dont handle the new ULSD fuels well. I also recommend doing the tune up recommended on those products packaging where you empty your fuel filter or get a new one fill it up with straight additive product and run that through. On an old diesel of mine this cleaned things out significantly and improved performance.Keep your filters in good shape and know that there may be redundant filters that you dont even know about in the fuel oil air intake and cooling paths.Be sure to find and grease any and all zerks grease fittings regularly if it has them. If the wheel hubs take oil know how to check the levels and quality of their oil and keep them filled properly. The drive wheels generally get their oil from the differential case learn to check this as well.Rooftop storage can be a huge asset  depending on how the structure is built your best bet is usually running upright supports down the sides that extend above secured with at least  heavyduty bolts with lock washers or locking nuts! each. A simple cargo net can be your friend as well.I may add more as I think of them.,howto,cgfrikf,4,t5_2qh69

1349198,0,t3_29i29n,This article is pretty much everything you shouldnt do.  first use a plastic scraper instead of metal or you take a chance in screwing up the finish of your tile or your tub. Second using mineral spirits could potentially cause damage to your tub or surround if it is plastic fiberglas so regular rubbing alcohol is a better choice. Third there is no need to tape either side of the seam as you only need to do clean up if you dont cut the tip large enough and you are inconstant in your application.  Third the tub should really be filled with water to weigh it down. The reason for this is your tub will move just a little and caulking it while its filled will put the caulk under compression while the tub is empty and the seam will not have any pulling forces acting on it when you take a bath. Most tub caulk fails because of poor prep and repeated tension on it. Take your time use a quality caulk do the proper prep work and it will hold up for many years.   ,howto,cilewjx,2,t5_2qh69

Pants with bright colours should be avoided if you dont want to look like an edgy teenage girl. Do not ever mix two colours that are slightly different navy and black for example. You can do blue and black but the lighter the blue the better. Know what the hot cold and neutral colours are and avoid mixing bright cold and bright hot colours. Neutral goes well with everything but dont dress completely in tan otherwise you will look ridiculous. Shoes and pants shouldnt be the same colour they blend together too much.

This way your wifes twin side is to her firmness and your twin is set to your firmness but with the topper you can both still cuddle.gtIve done the chiropractor thing for awhile with no lasting results one visit per week for a few months with readjustments at least once a month but it never sticks.No it does not because there is something thats always pushing it back out of alignment. Sometimes its multiple causes that each require its own solution. For instance soft chairs cushy ride vehicles and firm beds work for me.You also have to determine what is exactly your problem pinched nerve can occur with other things like a herniated disk in the spine as well as SJD.So yes a medical doctor is likely the best solution for a accurate diagnosis not a chiropractor who basically just cracks everything.gtIm sure my posture has a lot to do with it as does my weight the only problem I find is I have difficulty exercising because if I trigger my right lower back it pinches my sciatic and my right leg is basically useless for a few days.The object is to go on a diet and do exercises like swimming that doesnt put pressure on. Less weight less pressure when your in bed walking etc.gtThe stretches the chiropractor gives me dont seem to help. Yep same here its like they really dont want you to get well so they have to do it and for money.Yoga exercises work very well as women tend to have SJD if you have SJD more than men.It may take several attempts to finally push a SJD if you have it into place combined with fixing anything thats causing it to come undone ie the bed then ibuprofen to relieve the swelling. Then doing things that dont put it out again.gtThe pain is so intense it radiates to my ribcage and I have difficulty breathing when I wake. I find myself constantly tired having to sleep in my car on lunch and exhausted when I get home and try to compensate with energy drinks since theyre so good for you right?I think you need to see a doctor and have everything checked out like a vehicle there are many moving or parts and any or all can be a source of the problem to your health.Eventually though it may have to come down to putting pins into the back to keep a SJD into place. If it becomes hypermobile then your basically disabled and unable to climb stairs.,howto,cy4gq16,2,t5_2qh69

10003329,0,t3_5ivq67,Agree with Vitamin C and D but throw in some E for good measure and make sure you get your daily dose of echinacea! As an extra insurance measure if you do start to feel anything coming on purchase some oil of oregano. Its a little pricy but you can find it at most drug stores and the bottle will last you a while since the stuff tastes like absolute fucking garbage. But it works really well will kick the ass of any cold you feel coming on. Best in honey and lemon tea with a tsp of honey and a fresh lemon slice. Edit Usually I would recommend following the dosage listed on the bottle for all the things Ive listed but with the Vitamin E and echinacea I usually double up the first day and then continue with the regular recommended dosage from there on.
