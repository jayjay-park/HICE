2804398,0,t1_cnmtrw1,I have many that is not an issue.  Some are coming online this week however I am going to stay out of the way untilunless they need me.,SilkRoadReloaded,cnmumko,1,t5_2yp1z
2804503,0,t1_cnmuvr0,The only agenda I have is not linking my name to anything. If you read through this account history I may allude to illegal actions but never have I confirmed or proven having a part in them. Opsec comes before anything else. If someone wanted they could easily link this account back to the person behind the screen. It doesnt matter. Nothing incriminating on this one. Coworkers? Youre flattering me. If I could be paid to spread dissent like that Japanese or Korean or something similar project where people were paid to support their own to make it appear global opinion was positive towards them I would have jumped on that ship years ago. But I havent because my country isnt viewed that negatively. SLRL may have its merits but youve made yourself a target. As paranoid as you are as obsessed with security as you seem to be this doesnt seem like a rational decision on your part.,SilkRoadReloaded,cnmv238,2,t5_2yp1z
