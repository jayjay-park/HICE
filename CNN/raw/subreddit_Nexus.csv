1554738,0,t3_2c11r2,So I think we need or at least I do more clarification on Android Silver.Im going to assume Silver is the umbrella term for Google will handle the updates so dont worry about your carrier or the OEM fucking things up.Nexus was previously the title for this program but now I think the Nexus name is becoming a product line similar to Samsungs Galaxy line of phones since the GPE and Android One devices have hit the scene.This could mean another product line from Google but would probably more likely create a definitive separation between Nexus GPE and the new Android One line. Nexus Google designed flagships GPE OEM designed flagships One affordable OEM modelsAll  of these categories are Android Silver products. Nexus for devs and enthusiasts GPE for people that want highend consumer devices with a more pure Android experience and One for highvalue devices with a promise of updates.With this model GPE exists to keep Samsung mainly but other top OEMs too in check. One exists to battle the Nokias and ZTEs of the world. So having covered the high and low end of consumers Nexus will continue to innovate with the future of Android in mind for developers.Everyones happy. Everyone at any level can get an Android phone thats running a pure vision of the software at their price point and they dont have to worry about not getting the latest update.In followup what about the term Google Experience device? I think while it was mainly used to describe GPE devices I think the term will get folded into Silver and GPE will take over as a product line moniker.,Nexus,cjb5rqi,1,t5_2rpms

5167251,0,t1_cv8txkx,gt Youre the one arguing about consumers complaining or changing prices not me.gt ... However Google received backlash on the first  for being pricey and the only option. The next year there is talk of a new X that will once again be priced lower. Affordability.You suggested that the reason for the x was consumer backlash. My point wasnt that google made a cheaper low end phone but instead that they made a top of the line phone for those who need it for the development that they do. I was pretty clear that the x is perfect for most developers because most developers dont need to push a system. I think the p is made with the few who will push it in mind. I think the   was always the plan but they decided to build an uber device for the particular few. I mean the leaked benchmarks for the p blew everything else out of the water.

5268056,0,t1_cvkxwr3,Despite my choice I wouldnt worry too much. For one Ive read that Google picked the newest Samsung panels because they want to deliver the best screen quality all around including colors resolution whatever. Also since its Google and not Samsung I imagine they wont have screen modes or whatever and will just make it good right out of the box. One mode basically so the focus is on it. AMOLED panels can be very accurate its just up to the maker to tune it well. I think the Note  had the most accurate phone screen ever or something?   So your only concern should depend on how long youre planning to use the phone since besides longevity theres no other real issues with AMOLEDs.  Even concerning longevity android isnt how it was up to . with all the black everywhere. Or at least the black notification bar which is in one place all the time. The screen is going to deteriorate pretty consistently so you probably couldnt tell until you compared it to a new one. I mean unless youre gonna run it as a desk clock or something  and get burnins from that.Anyway screen quality isnt a personal choice at all. PC monitors for example are tested VERY extensively and theres a clear good and bad by looking at the accuracy response times backlight consistency and all that. The problem is that in most phone reviews when talking about screens its basically is it bright colorful and has deep blacks? Great  and that annoys the hell out of me. I mean yeah I dont expect average tech reviewers to have equipment or time to do all that but its just that monitor review sites pretty much never test phones either. I guess it also comes down to no time and the fact that nobody really does work on phones where color accuracy is a concern but yet Id still love for SOMEONE to take up on the task. Therell sometimes be someone testing colors on a some flagship device but Ive never heard of anything beyond that like how fast the panel is. After all with all the scrolling you have to do on a phone it seems like it should be a concern..,Nexus,cvl1wxa,1,t5_2rpms

11102204,0,t3_5ygzbu,I replaced mine with another one a few weeks ago off the project fi store. Got the device protection to make sure it lasts until there is a reasonable option,Nexus,deqfbg9,1,t5_2rpms
11601516,0,t1_dga9rfy,I was like you almost at the  year mark...and yesterday my x just wouldnt start anymore.  Luckily Fi is replacing it as we speak...but being without a phone during teacher call back season is making me real real anxious.,Nexus,dgb1hbx,1,t5_2rpms
11606760,0,t3_65l9xx,Thats impressive as hell because its a fixed aperture f. lens  specs of dust are barely noticeable at F. and usually dont start to become noticeable until like f. or f..Im not really sure what to suggest  maybe try compressed air?,Nexus,dgbmwog,1,t5_2rpms
11714342,0,t1_dgn6rjo,I actually brought it to the VW dealership and they confirmed it was indeed the phone.  Ive got an MK with the base CD player.  I was thinking about getting a vw  head unit with the touchscreen.  I want it to look stock so no flashy fold out screens with cheetahs running across animations,Nexus,dgnulv8,1,t5_2rpms
