2236365,0,t1_clo331u,Cool I would like to go in there at some point as its such a famous gig venue so be cool to check it out again. I spent a summer in Galway when I was younger but I cant remember the name of the nightclub we went to all the time. I think you went upstairs when you got in the door it was on a side street off one of the main pedestrian shopping streets. If anyone can guess it from that very vague description Ill be amazed. Anywhere open later than am or is that going to be closing time everywhere?,galway,clo3gbj,1,t5_2rj4i

11546333,0,t1_dg3kf53,Just to make sure youre not being duped. Did you respond to an advertisement and you havent seen the place yet and you can pay the deposit and they give you time to do so? For almost every single place in Galway you dont get time to decide . You say yes then the landlord will decide and if they want you you pay the deposit same day or they will pick somebody else. Any chance that you found a place with owner currently out of the country visiting his daughter or some crap why they couldnt be here right now? Reasonable price nice location not anymore listed on daft.ie? Please be careful. If you can pay the deposit without seeing the place yourself dont pay. Its a scam. Its very common. ,galway,dg4s27b,2,t5_2rj4i
