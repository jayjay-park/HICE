11528957,0,t1_dg2q2vm,I for one asked GSC for an extra joint for my okabe figma but they told me the figure was too old and couldnt get me a replacement. Might work differently for nendos for all I know ,Nendoroid,dg2t54y,1,t5_2u14a
11714674,0,t1_dgn8e6l,This if youre looking to buy any GSC products from another retailer go to that link. You avoid bootlegs and if the figure breaks or has a flaw you can get a replacement part. As long as you have a receipt from a partner company.,Nendoroid,dgnvyle,2,t5_2u14a
