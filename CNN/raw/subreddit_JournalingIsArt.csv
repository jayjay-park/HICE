3920461,0,t3_35cphy,I am currently using a journal like this made from a manila file folder.  I do art and writing on x index cards that fit perfectly in the folder.,JournalingIsArt,cr362y9,1,t5_2vmc8
5810117,0,t3_3ulhi1,Hobonichi uses Tomoe River paper. Very thin but remarkably good at holding inks. Very littleno bleedthru but some have complained about ghosting. In addition inks are very slow to dry because the papers so good at not soaking them up.Sorry I cant speak to particular markers that work best. I use fountain pens on my Tomoe River notebooks.,JournalingIsArt,cxhatbk,1,t5_2vmc8
6346308,0,t3_41m7js,I definitely never forced myself into any journaling when I first bought mine. My initial inspiration for one came from an old friend  years ago after her trip to South America. I started off writing then doodling and eventually into drawings painting making lists for the monthweek etc. Ive had the same journal I started with those many years ago and im currently just trying to fill any negative space I have on pages with my thoughts ideas drawings or whatever else before I move on to my next one. Dont try to force yourself to get that first page or the second or the hundredth. Just know its for you regardless of how many people you know that sit around with their journals or notebooks all day. I had a good two year span where I would only look at mine maybe once a month. Now I havent been able to put it down. If it doesnt come dont let it!,JournalingIsArt,czb06v5,1,t5_2vmc8
