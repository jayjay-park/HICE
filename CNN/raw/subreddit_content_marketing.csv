6395238,0,t1_czgjwsr,Thanks. Ive experimented with Outbrain. It drove traffic sure enough but the quality was poor bounce rate time on site coversions etc and it was nonreturning. Quoting influencers is a cool idea. I will try that out.,content_marketing,czgkmlp,2,t5_2zbx8

9760406,0,t1_dag6jhz,It does. But publishing platforms like Medium have millions of original articles so a couple thousand duplicate articles really wont affect their search efforts. These are authoritative sites.But yes if majority of your own blogs content is duplicate you will be penalized. Thats why I was saying you must publish your content first on your own site so Google bots can index your page and mark you as the original creator. Now any other site that publishes the same content a month later will be identified as duplicate content. Add a linkback or canonical from the duplicate content to the original content helps as well.,content_marketing,dag6s3v,2,t5_2zbx8
