For that  seconds any enemy who achieves a lock on with missiles within m of the anti stalker whether it targets the anti stalker or no when they fire their missile suddenly target whoever the anti stalker is targeting and the damage gets awarded to the anti stalker.

11040608,0,t1_dejadx2,Id love to see three things in this regard. Traction on all maps doesnt equate to reality in which heavy bots have more traction than lighter bots snow driving anyone? and so you should take a hard look at how heavier bots behave on multiple maps.. Can we implement a circle around the main reticle that suppresses the display of player names and clan tags so we can actually see what we are targeting? On many maps that have varying heights most you often cannot see another bot under your reticle because they are obscured by someones name. A  screenwidth ring should do and people can see the names of others if they just turn the reticle to the side momentarily. This ring shouldnt suppress friendfoe indicator triangles just the names and clan tags.. Autolock when firing. This is one of the biggest frustrations among top players.
