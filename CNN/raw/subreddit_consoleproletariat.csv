4194140,0,t3_37nglw,Great video although he might want to mention that quality can also depend on what kind of television being used.  I have a Sony WEGA  CRT television that has component inputs but doesnt support progressive scan.  So although I have the component cables I dont see a significant difference when compared to SVideo or even composite.Also the Gameboy Player Disc for Gamecube itself supports progressive scan however the Gameboy games do not and therefore dont really benefit from progressive scan  as indicated on Nintendos own website.

4235797,0,t3_39g920,As much as I love Crochet Yoshi and many of the ideas showcased in the game I also gotta criticize Nintendo here  Why would you choose an art style like that and NOT go full circle with it? Like why are the water splashes rendered as yarn awesome! but flames are drawn as conventional graphics? Or why are almost all enemies fully crocheted... but some are only outlines as if they were leftovers from Kirbys Epic Yawn thingy? Or also why are there vastly different scales of yarnage? Compared to Yoshi sometimes yarn seems to have the thickness of a gardening hose yet sometimes it has approx. reallife scale i.e. much smaller? Its such a nice concept but the execution is a bit on the sluggish side  especially by classic Nintendo standards. Lots of missed opportunities partially destroying the illusion of a true yarn world the game should have been aiming at. Its kind of a pity really... ,consoleproletariat,cs32jd7,1,t5_3529b
