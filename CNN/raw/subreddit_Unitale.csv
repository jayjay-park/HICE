While Lua is not hard at all to begin with everything that beginners need to do to make a playable battle is written plainly in the example scripts.  Anything people want to do extra other than making new attacks from scratch is done with simple if statments and variables.

If youre using a montage software before uploading it this is what I do then your software probably works with  FPS Sony Vegas Pro does and it may not be possible to get  FPS anymore yes it alters the framerate which is kinda stupid...The only thing I found in SVP to get  FPS is making a BluRay version and since it takes a lot of time its not happening on my end.
