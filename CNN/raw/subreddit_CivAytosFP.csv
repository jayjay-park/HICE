2336511,0,t1_clz0tbb,Hmm suspending the rules is a way to skip everything and vote immediately even if everyone hasnt posted in the thread and if it also hasnt been  days.  In this case we have all  posted now so calling a vote falls within the rules... we no longer need to supend them.The reason the rules are written this somewhat convoluted way is in typical parliamentary law no matter what rules are set up they can be bypassed by a  vote.  In a situation like this though where the whole point of suspending the rules is to pass a law immediately scheduling a new  vote on it is not helpful that adds time.  So I tried to combine it all into one step instead of actually holding a  vote on suspending the rules we can assume that everyone would vote yes and just go with it.  But later it if it turns out someone did not agree with skipping the ordinary rules they can object in the thread and undo it.Now I think this is a bad way to have it set up.  If  members vote to pass a law but then the third member who didnt vote is allowed to object and unpass the law that will cause problems.  Its better if we just force laws through a process even if it takes a few days.  What is the hurry anyway?  I dont think Aytos has ever seen a law that absolutely needed to be passed in one day.  The Serene Duke act comes closest because we had to get that law introduced and passed through parliament on the exact day before the election in order to catch PILF off guard but even in that case we spent a week or so planning and writing that bill in private.,CivAytosFP,cm0i7g9,1,t5_2yfdd
