85189,0,t1_ceo4flv,Parking in the lot in front of the convocation center takes me no more than  minutes to get to class from the time I get out of my car to the time I reach the classroom door. No parking on campus is decently close to anything. We are all going to walk. Plain and simple.  spaces further back in the parking lot really makes no difference.,UTSA,ceo4lqz,1,t5_2s2yy
103291,0,t1_cept9z7,Its equivalent although reductive to compare your plight with complaining to the city about having to drive so slowly through school zones.  Just because you dont see the immediate benefit in something doesnt mean its groundless.  The professor isnt there to bend to your whims or cater to your learning style.  Thats what oneonone tutoring sessions are for.  The professor is there to teach the class in the manner that he or she sees fit.  If its so unbearable Id suggest changing sections while you still can.,UTSA,ceq6vxd,8,t5_2s2yy
121130,0,t3_1vghte,The only time I used rowdy dollars was when they preloaded my is with like  for freshman orientation...which was like three years ago. I honestly think rowdy dollars is more of a feature for parents in that rowdy dollars can only be used at UTSA and they have the assurance that their student would be spending money on things they may not approve. ,UTSA,ces830t,7,t5_2s2yy

6220751,0,t1_cywou64,Well we hope that with the support of students and administration our org will stay around for a long time. This semester we are working on getting a few things for SXSW. Last semester we gave away  Day Passes to ACL. We also team up with a lot of venues and give away a bunch of tickets to our members and listeners! So feel free to follow us on the socials!

6531910,0,t3_44cxwg,I was one of the first people to sign a lease with Prado back in Fall . Notice how the apartment complex is still under construction right now although its nearing  completion? Yeah think of how it was a year and a half ago. I paid  in rent every month and they put me up in the La Cantera Resort and later the Holiday Inn. Shit was cash. Never had to make my bed or breakfast for the entire semester.Okay thats not contributing to the post. I live at the Luxx now they transferred us to other apartments but I am almost always over at Prado since my buddy lives there. Its looking better and once its completed itll be great. The only thing is Im not sure if they are going to have a shuttle available to school. Yeah maybe you dont really want to walk across the ginormous parking lot every day just to get to classes.. a shuttle would be nice. Its safe. Dont worry about it for now.,UTSA,czuy9ao,1,t5_2s2yy

8337418,0,t3_4ti83c,Ive taken both and theyre both good professors. Id say if you need a stronger foundation in math Prof. Kennedy is the way to go. Prof. Stamovs teaching and grading style is exactly like his wifes Prof. Stamova. If you look at her reviews then thatll give you an idea of what Stamov is like.,UTSA,d5jqcmo,1,t5_2s2yy
8460509,0,t1_d5w8xya,Sorry for the delay. Thanks for the info! Im in a bit of a tight spot regarding offcampus housing then since I dont know anyone in the area I can room with. In Oaks do they just put you with a random student and leave it at that? Or can you ask to move with someone else? Also can you compare Hillcountry Place Apartments with High View Place Apartments? And is UTSA area alright for bicycle travel?  Thank you.,UTSA,d5z3ku2,1,t5_2s2yy
8653258,0,t3_4ydlns,The best person to ask is your assigned advisor who can enter information into your file showing that you replaced MS  with STA . They can also override your file if you want to take MS  at the same time as IS .Since the semester is starting in a few days Id advise sending your advisor an email because youll never get an appointment on time. If you dont know who your advisor is log onto ASAP and theres an Advisor Contact link under Student Services.,UTSA,d6n9rww,1,t5_2s2yy
