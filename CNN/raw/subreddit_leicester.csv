1897731,0,t3_2gcpt1,Ill echo utrm in that the advertised student nights out are mostly shit you should go to them at least once just for the experience but afterwards  dont go again. Repetitive bland pop music in which you hear the same track list every week and the attitude of people becomes passive aggressive inside those club.The bars utrum are highly recommended. Also if youre looking to discover real beer P then those already mentioned and criterion will satisfy you as tapscriterion typically host dozens of beers from all over the world every week.Guess it depends on your music tastes.  Redeemer is the place to go for alternative rock metal goth EBM Industrial and a plethora of Hard Dance genres. Though these events arent usually weekly. Leicester has a very big Dub scene Dub is not dubstep usually hosted at The Music Cafe which also hosts UK Hardcore Drum n Bass House Techno and Trance. Personally Id go to Music Cafe over Sophbeck as the vibe there is a little disconcerting. Theres also a few smaller places that put on mini UK Hardcore raves personally I think the music is awful compared to true Gabber but they are usually a good experience.East Midlands and Stanstead airports host the European budget airlines they can fly you out to europe for very cheap. I typically fly StansteadEindhoven Netherlands several times a year and it costs like .I dont know a huge amount about the attractions and things to see in the city itself. Best to go to the tourist office to get a proper idea for that  ,leicester,ckhv7dh,2,t5_2qx6x
