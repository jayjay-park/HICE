Note that this was taken before Rebecca Chambers joining. it is also worth noting that there are twelve members shown in the photo here one of whom is unidentified.

I really wanted to have a little helper fairy kind of character in the opening that was kind of like Navi in Zelda. I wanted to do a play on that where Kratos basically got annoyed with it in the first half of the first level and killed it. I thought that would be really fun and we just never had time to set up that whole thing,VideogameMysteries,cga5doe,2,t5_2wqoc
