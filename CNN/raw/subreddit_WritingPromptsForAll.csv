8465045,0,t1_d5tdj2h,I liked this one a lot a sweet story wrapped around an allpowerful and otherworldly character. Felt that the revelation that he did want love wasnt too surprising because of all we had known about him previously that he wasnt a cold malicious god or even one interested in godly politics. He just wanted to spend time alone which essentially humanized him. But nevertheless the moments where he discovered love were well done her radiating light especially was a neat job in describing his feelings. NeatO job!,WritingPromptsForAll,d5zo1se,2,t5_3365e
