1025365,0,t3_25ugmz,I agree. And if not UHC every time at least some sort of game or event depending on how many people can make it.The only reason I dont think we should do UHC every two weeks is that I like others are going to be putting up one of these episodes every two days and with  episodes itll take  weeks to post all of them. Thats a lot of editing and processing not to mention uploads overlapping with one another. But Id love to do a UHC like every  or  weeks with other events or other games Garrys Mod ? the other days.I say we plan to do some sort of event every other Saturday night.,InfiniteGaming,chku9kr,2,t5_31eoa
