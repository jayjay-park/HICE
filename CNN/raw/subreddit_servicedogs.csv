5748931,0,t3_3tutk1,   The rules governing service dogs are found in the federal code of regulations. They are difficult to find. You can always give the Dept. Of Justice a call. You may wait on hold for more than a hour but it is usually worth it. If I read the question and answer the face value I say yes the right dog with the right training can have a skill set that includes service dog tasks to midigate a disability and also be trained in protection sports. A properly trained dog can have more than one skill set and in the right hands can go from one to another flawlessly. The first trainer that mentored me trained for a local Sheriff dept. She felt those trained protection dogs were the safest dogs to be around because they never would perform unless given a command. I had a client once who was a victim of a violent crime. She purchased a protection trained GS. She felt safe with the dog at home and when out jogging. After having the dog for a couple years she came to me to seek aditional training that would make the dog able to accompany her anyplace. One of those long waits to DOJ was to ask if the trained tasks could include protection training. The woman stated she had PTSD from her attack. DOJ said no because the dogs training exceeded minimal protection. A body blockdog moves to interrupt invasion of handlers personal space is about the extent of the laws view of personal protection. So if that scenario helps in case there is more to the question. I think there are service dogs who benefit greatly by having other trained hobbies like agility dock diving you name it.

8444704,0,t3_4vbott,I dont know of any in California.  You may have to widen your search to include the whole US.  Personally I had a super hard time finding a program who would place psych SDs and also accept me as a client.,servicedogs,d5x4jn1,1,t5_2sv5w

8748719,0,t1_d6z833j,You could call the dog a support animal for yourself and the therapist may be able to integrate the dog into a treatment plan but the laws that grant some limited rights to emotional support animals are to provide equal access to disabled people so she would not qualify for those protections. While ESAs dont need to be task trained they still must mitigate symptoms of a disability such as disabiling anxieity though their comforting presence.,servicedogs,d6z8tqz,3,t5_2sv5w
9671959,0,t1_da58jfx,Oooo thank you for that! I have looked at Collies before when my mom suggested it she had a Collie Doberman when she was in college and I wasnt sure if that would be a good breed to look up or not because the temperament could have came from the Doberman but your input makes it sound like a very good breed for service dog work! I will have to look into some good reputable Collie breeders!,servicedogs,da59sjm,2,t5_2sv5w
