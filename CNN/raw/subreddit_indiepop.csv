9645222,0,t1_da1vf2f,Sorry didnt want to be so harsh on you. Just keep it simple. No need to do so much unnecessary effects. Also in my opinion you are trying to impress audience with your jokes too much and it becomes annoying. Try to be more like yourself. People tend to like other people because of who they are not because of who they pretend to be for them. I hope I expressed myself clearly enough. Good luck in future!,indiepop,da1z1dq,1,t5_2s3ux
