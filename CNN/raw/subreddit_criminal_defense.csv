1592342,0,t1_cj57bsg,I do not think it is necessarily incorrect it just seems to lack substance. Ambiguities are laid out throughout the post that needs to be fleshed out. One prime example isgtOne another aspect in this crime is the felony arrest and felony charges. Felony arrest is when the police suspects a person for felony charges and arrests him. Whereas the felony charges is the one where there is entry of charges in to record during a formal court hearing. Once the defendant gets convicted with these charges then he is found to be guilty.Felony arrest to be arrested for alleged felony actsFelony charge felony acts as conveyed in law that are to be disputed in courtHe is right that the charges are made known against the defendant in the preliminary hearing where also the defense may plea guilty or nonguilty but he subsequently leaves out details of a trial. One will not be convicted at their hearing but at the end of the trial after a jury deliberates on the charges against the defense and makes their verdict.Then in the following paragraphgtThere is a great possibility that a person subjected to felony arrest but not a felony charge. For example the suspect is arrested for a felony charge but from possible information obtained only misdemeanor charges is placed on him. Thus felony charges are easily expunged that any other crime. If a person is subjected to a felony arrest then this might be indicated in the criminal record but the public cannot have an access to the details about the arrest.I think what the poster is trying to convey is the process of plea bargaining. That is when the prosecution and defense negotiate to lower or drop charges. The prosecution may not have enough evidence to convict for a felony crime so instead would have to settle for a lesser charge. It is not exactly expungement rather it is simply dropping the felony charges.Before those two paragraphs the information seems moreorless correct. Word choice should be strengthened in a few areas to lessen ambiguity but yeah.,criminal_defense,cjfvvnt,1,t5_32bef
