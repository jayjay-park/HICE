9966,0,t3_1u8mw4,Simple answer to the initial question is no. BPD can increase susceptibility to Depression but not turn into it.They can and often do coexist but BPD cannot mutate into depression.BPD is a personality disorder while depression is an illness of sorts.While talking to people online is no replacement for therapy its very important you find someone whether on here or elsewhere with experience treating it to talk to.Id offer to help but Im quite sure Im not what you need.Your fight is a difficult one but I hope you keep on fighting.,BPD,cefkito,1,t5_2qqdp

42820,0,t3_1ulbi2,Its a complicated topic for me.  As someone who has BPD and as someone who is a mental health professional who works with people who have BPD and other psychiatric disorders I can see both sides of the argument.I think its mostly about tone.  Usually when I hear somebody say a BPD its almost always in a negative context.  You will never read any legitimate bookarticlestudyetc. that calls anybody a BPD and nor will you hear a good therapist ever use that term.  In fact I cant even remember ever hearing that term being said aloud I only see it on websitesforumsarticles disparaging people with BPD.  It is literally calling a person a disorder.However it is very common to see borderline used as a noun that refers to a person for example he is a borderline or as an adjective that describes a person for example hes borderline in a legitimate bookarticlestudyetc. Its simply the terminology thats used and I dont find it offensive.Yes I do think its best to use language like a person who has borderline personality disorder when its convenient because it emphasizes personhood over diagnosis but it simply isnt realistic to use that language all the time.  When youre talking about BPD and you refer to someone as a borderline male then its clear that youre addressing one particular aspect of their identity the fact that they have borderline personality disorder.  Its about context.  In the context of the narrative the males diagnosis of borderline personality disorder is of relevance not other aspects of their personhood such as their ethnicity hobbies etc..  For example I wouldnt introduce my friend Ted who has borderline personality disorder by saying This is Ted hes borderline but if I were writing an article about Teds struggle with borderline personality disorder with his consent of course then I would have no problem with referring to him as a borderline male or with saying Ted is borderline because to me that is synonymous with saying Ted has borderline personality disorder.  In the same way that the statement Ted is diabetic isnt interpreted as being any more reductionist than saying Ted has diabetes Ted is borderline shouldnt be seen as a derogatory statement.Heres another analogy it would be offensive to refer to a person who has major depressive disorder in the following way I used to date an MDD and it was a nightmare.  However it wouldnt be offensive to say shes depressed because thats just another way of saying she has major depressive disorder.Sorry that was really disjointed because Im half asleep but thats just my take on this!,BPD,cejb17f,3,t5_2qqdp
43118,0,t3_1ug7vi,I feel like every single one of us in this subreddit has had this kind of freak out to not only those close to us but those who have met us at unfortunate times while we were being heavily triggered.Youre OK. Youre not awful. Before you rush to make it better I would recommend just learning to accept yourself. It took me a while but after accepting myself I became better at accepting my mistakes as they arise and figuring out how Id like to go about doing damage control or letting go.If you seek restitution before you start accepting yourself you may seek a certain outcome from your attempts at apologizing and those outcomes may or may not ever materialize which may disappoint people like you and I.But youre OK.It happens to most if not all of us here in this subreddit. Youre accepted and youre alright.,BPD,cejc9cg,1,t5_2qqdp

108984,0,t3_1vapxg,I did CBT first roughly  week course with one hour session a week. CBT is more exercise based and very structured and deals with your perceptions and way of thinking. The exercises were very simple to understand and complete via paperwork and small mental tasks. Many different people found it useful including those with anxiety depression PTSD and bipolar. It includes tackling subjects such as how to deal with anxiety and depression combatting negative thinking core beliefs and how they link to our unhealthy behaviours how to be aware of what we are thinking and why and changing this thought process.CBT worked wonders for me and was very easy to follow and feel like you were improving step by step. At this point I did not know I had BPD but it helped almost eradicate the above problems. Doing DBT a couple of years later completing CBT first felt like a great foundation and stepping stone to understanding a lot of DBTs more complex ideas and it made it a lot easier for my psychologist to skip a lot of basics and tackle the harder core issues.DBT seems more flexible and your psychologist should cater to each individual. Some of it can be exercise based but is usually taught subtly by talking about real life situations and implementing the technique in that particular scenario. As ujrandahlm made a great job of explaining dialectics is quite a complex philosophy of accepting two opposing ideas and this is relevant to DBT as the opposing idea is that we must accept how we are but also change. DBT takes much longer to implement as the ideas can be complex and you are literally reshaping the thoughts your brain has grown with. I am currently up to about  hour long fortnightly sessions of DBT and my partner and I have noticed huge amazing improvement in my thought process emotions and behaviour. I find DBT helps with the more deepercomplexspecific emotional aspects specific to my particular BPD manifestation that CBT was not so detailed in such as loneliness abandonment sense of self the reality of how things really are in relationships as opposed to the skewed beliefs I grew up with and much more.If you have the resources I strongly recommend doing CBT then DBT. It helped my understanding of a lot of complex theories and helped ease my way into recovery. Everyone no matter if they have mental problems or not will benefit from both these therapies. I did group CBT which I recommend as hearing other peoples point of views and using others as examples helps a lot. I am doing oneonone DBT although my psychologist recommends group DBT would be good for me at the same time. Also dont forget that the effectiveness is affected by how much you are willing to work towards recovery and how open you are. Also that each person is different with different ways of thinking and learning so your personal therapist may suggest different therapies. For example depending on how your BPD affects you schema therapy may work a lot better than DBT as it takes into account different levels of functioning.Hope that helped feel free to ask more questions or for details as Im confident with my knowledge of both kinds and other options available. Ive had amazing psychologists in the past and my current psych and I had a huge discussion on different therapies and how they work etc ,BPD,cequ92g,2,t5_2qqdp

314121,0,t3_1xoa44,I had exactly this issue.  I was  a school teacher for  years.  I built a very promising career and there were high expectations of me rising up the career ladder.  I gave talks to other teachers wrote articles on teaching etc but I found it harder and harder to manage  I got tired burnt out and couldnt do what people wanted or expected of me.  I also found myself increasingly giving less of a shit when people put pressure on me.  I found as well that once I hit my thirties I was getting more tired and finding juggling my emotions much harder in a high pressure environment. I took the big decision to leave my career and turned to the voluntary sector instead.  Its given me the best of both worlds really.  I still work with kids which is what I really loved but I dont have the high pressure career ladder orientated aspect of the job or the work to take home.  People in the voluntary sector tend to be waaaay better informed and more understanding of mental health conditions and Ive found that theyre happy to work around my therapy bad days etc.  I also dropped a day of work a week so I only do four days.  Financially its tough but it means I get a bit more recuperationhibernationfiddling around doing my own crap time which means Ive been able to work on better coping mechanisms be less tired etc.  As a result my mental health has been way better than its ever been.  I would definitely recommend charity or caring work their just seems to be a different culture in those sectors. ,BPD,cfdbt55,3,t5_2qqdp
314190,0,t3_1xkl7h,The article describes a person with BPD to be intentionally manipulative as if their intention is to deceive you Im supposing it is written in an accusatory manner so the nonBPD partner in an abusive relationship wont shrug it off. People with BPD inherently have a great compability with people who were also raised in a certain way or born a certain way often a mix. They will listen to your thoughts giving you the feeling that they need to be rescued. You feel as if you have a control in this relationship and when things are going fine as they should be they suddenly jump back into the pit and you have to rescue them again.I havent heard of a certain case of relationship with a BPD person where the BPD person does genuinely care about how devastating it is to be in a relationship with them even if you describe it in the most complex or metaphorical way even if you tell them you barely want to live anymore they show NOTHING. They may even threaten to hurt themselves if you leave. This does not apply to every person diagnosed with BPD ever in the universe maybe not even half of them but from anecdotal evidence and reading a lot about this I can tell you that if youre not an extremely stable person or a person that carries  emotional bagage youre ready for a relationship with someone with the most intense kind of BPD. They can be lovely and amazing people but theyre also broken in a way and if you are the one that needs mental support they will not offer it theyll do the opposite and drag you down with them not with malicious intent but pure confusion and fright.If you havent commit to a relationship completely yet break out of it. If you try to leave them theyll guilt you threaten you and possibly try to ruin your social connections possessions stalk you and call you for months. Like Im saying this is not purely anecdotal this is from once being talking and working with people who went through the same.Only go into a relationship with a BPD person if you can determine that theyre highly functional if they can take care of themselves professional relationships jobs et cetera there is no issue if you instead find a damaged partner with histories or current coping mechanisms such as self harm and drug abuse you can not save these people they need professional help.,BPD,cfdc2fm,2,t5_2qqdp

371434,0,t1_cfj7qr5,Im not sure I  understand what you are getting at but I will try answering anyway. Feel free to correct me. I have noticed that flipping it around in your mind helps forgiving yourself. if you would face a similar situation where someone you know and care about would act the same way as you do would you forgive them or hold it over their heads for an eternity? Especially if you know they suffer from something like BPD. Or If someone I know would fuck up like this would I really be so tough on them as I currently imagine they are being to me?I started writing a blog for myself where I rant and scream and try to understand. For me it really does help to write the stuff down and read it back to myself. Usually then I get what is the real issue and what is just BPD and insecurities exploding inside my head. Every action of course has a consequence and part of taking control means that you own up to your own shit. But it also means giving yourself some slack. You are learning something that other people know already how to do. Its like learning a new language. You are going to make many mistakes and suck at it at first. It doesnt mean you somehow deserve to stay in that cycle. That kind of thinking is a symptom not reality. It just means you need to keep rinsing and repeating until you get better.

It becomes abuse when your usage of marijuana reaches the point where your functioning is being impaired in some way its getting in the way of you fulfilling duties making you feel sad you feel like you cant stop doing it etc..  Smoking cigarettes is a little bit different because many people would argue that any amount of smoking cigarettes is abuse because theyre so physically dangerous but thats another story.Substance abuse is very common among those with BPD.  Research shows that about  of people with BPD will abuse substances at some point in their lives.  There are multiple reasons for this.  First people with BPD tend to have a hard time regulating their emotions and sometimes substances can help us do that you said that smoking pot helps relax you for example.  Likewise people with BPD tend to be more impulsive than others and might have a harder time stopping themselves from giving in to urges to use.  That means that a person who has BPD who uses substances is more likely to keep using them even when they know they shouldnt just a couple pills before work? I know I shouldnt but it just feels so good and itll only be this once! etc..  It can be a dangerous dynamic.Moral of the story be careful.  Some recreational drugs can be safe for some people if they use them responsibly.  People with BPD tend not to be those people.  That doesnt mean it isnt possible just that it might be more difficult.  My advice would be to stay away even from anything more than very small amounts of alcohol if you struggle with mood andor behavioral issues.,BPD,chdupdy,1,t5_2qqdp

1082942,0,t1_chrdh6p,I believe you will always be truly black to her. The reason she reacted the way she did to your sugary sweet messages was definitely because she was feeling an assload of guilt and convinced herself that you where trying to manipulate her into feeling guilty for her actions. Been there done that.I personally have a habit of demonizing the ones I love in order to justify the way I am hurting them. As I am super aware of my triggers and my reactions to said triggers I try not to do it anymore.Seems like she was feeling trapped in your relationship and was searching for a way out you provided that by leaving it gave her time to resort her thoughts about you without physically seeing the surmounting evidence against her newly created ideas of your relationship. You reminding her of that conversation made her feel like shit probably breaking the illusion and making her feel like she was fooling herself. Everyone hates that feeling people with BPD more so. She may in the future realize her wrongdoing but she will never regret her decision. From experience memories get so cloudy after time you remember those feelings you had though. The urgency and the need to escape. It was definitely her protecting herself. The best way to not be demonized in her eyes is to leave her alone forever she will contact you in a few years the way she most likely contacted her old ex and what she will say will have a lot of clarity and she will probably be at the end of another relationship. So the cycle goes.,BPD,chrdsri,1,t5_2qqdp

Preparing for acting easing nerves for an interview figuring out where your body is holding the most tension etc. Its also a kind of mindfulness or selfawareness which can lead into meditation.This would definitely help minor cases of anxiety or stress as often we tense up in places and dont realise it and the rest of our body then follow suit causing our brain to react and spiral into a more anxious state. This technique would help one to notice every muscle and know if its tense or relaxed and therefore relax themselves and clear their mind to avoid anxiety.Good contribution ,BPD,chvkyt2,2,t5_2qqdp

I wont ever try to diminish that.  That said there is absolutely a reason to keep on. If it needs to be an outside reason like your kid right now thats ok. If its an internal reason like there is no way youre going to let anything get between you and remembering what it means to enjoy even a tiny slice of life thats ok too. You make the reason but let there be one because its your head telling you there isnt. And if us BPDers know one thing its that our heads arent always playing for our team.

1265303,0,t3_28l17w,I took  months off uni.  months of that were holidays anyway  months summer break  month easter. So I was pretty lucky in that respect.However my breakdown came at the worst time. It was in the final semester so I missed all my exams and coursework deadlines. I was battling depression. It became apparent that Ive had it all of my life and was only diagnosed with it by summer break that year. That year was definitely the worst thing Ive ever experienced. It was mainly due to the situational circumstances I had found myself in on top of the already existing depression. sorry I dont know how to describe it. Perhaps like the existing depression was like a dull tooth ache always been there but been there that long youve never really noticed it until it was pointed out. The situational depression was like having a knife to the gums. Sharp severe and added to the dull ache of the tooth.The pit of depression I was in is something I never want to go back to.I got help and I got better. Within a month of seeing a therapist I had drastically improved. It helped knowing that I wasnt alone there is always someone to talk to.I had to repeat my year at uni. I only had one hiccup along the way a bout of severe depression again due to the situational circumstances that made me miss a piece of coursework. Ive been allowed to resit it and should complete this year this time. When I suffered that hiccup I worried so much that I would spiral into the depression I was in before. But because I was now aware of depression and knew how it would get worse I pulled myself out of it pretty quickly. I knew my enemy I knew its weaknesses. I made myself get out of the house I went for walks I had fun with friends I went to lectures I did my other pieces of coursework. I did not lie in bed pull the covers over my head and let it beat me like it did last time.I still have the dullache depression but to me that is manageable. I still have therapy once a week and so the dull ache is getting better. I feel so much more confident knowing that I have defeated the demons twice now. And one of those times was before they had even surfaced.Id say that healing is different for everyone. Its okay to wait until you think you can manage yourself before getting a job again. Just by getting out the door to do your volunteering is a huge step in recovery.,BPD,cibynuy,4,t5_2qqdp

I had a group through my program that now that theyve graduated I know Ill never seetalk to them again. They were almost like family but now we have nothing in common. Some of the core members of the group still hang out but its exclusive on who they invite and guess what Im no longer part of that circle. My BPD affects my friendships more than my romantic relationships oddly enough. My point with all of that is once school is over you realize that maybe those friends arent really the friends you thought they were because of the setting.Im still at home since Im still in college and only work part time. Its frustrating because my family tries to come up with ways to solve my problems i.e spa day or a present but that doesnt change how much Im suffering.Im scared to get close to anyone because I cant take the hurt or abandonment that I feel.,BPD,cjzyufk,1,t5_2qqdp

1902396,0,t3_2gdhak,Im  but was diagnosed with BPD at  by a very insightful psychiatrist. I have gone long periods of time without any major debilitating symptoms so its definitely possible to be  and undiagnosed. Like you I was a college graduate with a good job and a pretty decent marriage. It just means that youre a fairly high functioning borderline. I have been hospitalized a few times and seen probably  people diagnosed with BPD. Among all of those diagnosed I have seen two other straight males and a few gay men that say they are borderline. Straight men rarely get diagnosed with BPD and are usually seen as having major depression or bipolar disorder. Its criminal really. Everything youve mentioned pertaining to relationships sounds depressingly like my own relationship history especially the large age gaps. Im almost positive youre an undiagnosed borderline.

I guess Im the only extrovert in this thread as well. My BPD was brought on by highfunctioning lowemotional parents not understanding my emotions not any kind of abuse and very little external trauma so I can understand how others experiences might have shaped them to be more introverted. Other people feed my energy like a delicious banana almond milk shake now Im hungry. Its when I am not around people that I really struggle. The one thing about having BPD that I can say especially since Im nearing remissionhooray! is that when it was really bad my sense of selfidentity was constantly in flux.

2044565,0,t1_ckxyxbb,And on the subject of men you are correct. I had always heard it was more common for women but I knew several men also have it my brother for instance as well. I had never actually looked into the statistics until now. Not that I was ever saying men didnt suffer from it but I thought it was an interesting fact you brought up.Seeing as its been referred to as a womans illness for so long I can see why theyve been focusing on removing the stigma against women. But from what I can tell since theyve been making note that its equally divided between men and women they are also working on removing that stigma for men now. People are still learning.Whether you see stigma as something that shouldnt even be bothered with yet or not I think its great that people are starting to care enough to even do that. The more people understand and the more theyre willing to research treatment and find more ways to help people not just dbt then I feel more people would be comfortable reaching out and gettinggiving help to those who need it and cant get it right now.I give kudos to anyone who wants to help seeing as so many people have been shunned. Whether its raising awareness or getting rid of the stigma. Making statements like theyre monsters is one reason so many people with bpd feel like shit about themselves. We are not monsters we just need someone to give us the fucking time of day and listen try to understand and give us direction. Because clearly we cannot do it on our own.,BPD,ckzpjqf,1,t5_2qqdp
2074719,0,t1_cl3dwke,gtI like cooking. A lot. Sometimes I think I should become a chef. Actually many people have suggested this Im a really good cook. I can get fancy but what I most enjoy is cooking simple wellprepared meals with fresh inseason and local ingredients.I hate to hijack this thread and please dont take this the wrong way but I would really really recommend against pursuing a kitchen job if you have any sort of stressinduced symptoms. We are talking about an industry where as a line cook you are personally yelled at for hours nonstop to work as quickly as possible with an often tremendous backlog of new orders that you have to keep in your head at all times all in a claustrophobic deafening sweltering dangerous environment. As a cook you will cut and burn yourself constantly and you have to keep working without pause when it happens. If you display any sort of personal weakness or emotional needs you will instantly lose respect and will be mocked and abused until you either man up or quit. It is an extremely testosteronesoaked industry meaning that anger is the only acceptable emotion and only by those above you in the hierarchy and you work so closely and interconnectedly with your coworkers that there is no tolerance for anything but singleminded cando determination.Basically You have to be able to take yelling and abuse every single night while physically sore and exhausted sweating and probably bleeding always working as fast as you physically can. You have to fix your inevitable fuckups while being screamed at and knowing that everyone there literally hates you in that moment. At the end of the night you are rewarded with a highfive for not completely losing your shit and walking out and then everyone binge drinks together its basically a teambuilding exercise that you cant opt out of. And then you all come back the next day and do it again. Every single day. Basically everyone who works in a kitchen is a raging alcoholic and smokes like a chimney just to deal with the stress.I was stupid enough to think that I could do it because it couldnt be any worse than what Ive already been through. So this year I began culinary school and working as a line cook in a fancy restaurant. Long story short I quit and dropped out in a record  months and was so panicked the last  or  that I was both crying and drinking almost every day and fantasizing desperately about running away. I was abused as a child and it was like having PTSD triggered every day for hours. Every fiber of my body would be screaming for me to run and hide but I had to stay there and take it. Ive been out for a couple months now and I am still struggling with my alcohol consumption since I am now so used to using it as an escape.I say all of this as someone who is also a really good cook who cares a lot about making wellprepared meals with local ingredients. I lost almost  lbs a few years ago after getting really into cooking from scratch paleo the farmtotable movement etc and considered that passion to be a huge part of who I am. Please trust me when I say that working in a kitchen even a fancy one that locally sources ingredients has almost nothing to do with any of that. And as you devolve into an animated corpse that survives mainly on tequila adrenaline expired restaurant food and latenight drivethru you eventually wake up one day and realize that you lost the passion you once had for those things as if it was an important piece of paper that fell out of your coat pocket.Keep it as a hobby.

I have definitely dealt with my fair share of unreasonable jealousy and fears but the older I am getting the wiserbetter my choice of partners seem to be and I deal with it a lot better nowadays. I am usually the one who forms quite strong emotional and romantic connections with others while I am in a committed relationship. I just have a lot of love to give I guess. So I am beginning to think that polyamory may be something I should trial in the near future. My current lover is totally open and very communicative and honest its been fantastic so far. Were just letting us become whatever we become and happily loving each other in the mean time.

As far as whether I have any regrets the main one would be not working harder in high school and college and not choosing a major that would have lead directly to a career rather than the fluffy stuff I ended up choosing. Sometimes I wish Id just gone to trade school and been a welder or something you know?  Just to have the peace of mind rather than doing jobs that kindasorta fit my skill set.

2433741,0,t3_2nd2nw,Okay I am also at a very dark place but reading your post brings me to my knees figuratively I guess?. If you want to get better you are going to have to change everything. You are going to have to stop talking to all these friends. You are going to have to isolate yourself. Its so incredibly hard and painful especially for someone with BPD. When I stopped drinking and I have been drinking again recently for transparencys sake I had to stop talking to all of my drinking friends. I was very lonely. They would text me and ask me to hang out and I would have to say no because I knew that they would only be drinking. So your first step is going to be to distance yourself from all of these people who you think are your friends.Second its pretty obvious that you have a drug problem. Im not saying this to be mean trust me. I think that you should try to find a program that you can participate in. If you dont have the money there are a lot of lowincome programs that will help you get clean. What youre feeling right now is probably a really bad combo of drug withdrawal and very severe depression. Many of us with BPD are aware of severe depression and know how hard it is to get out of it another truth I still havent. Third you need to find a therapist who specializes in BPD DBT. Ive gone to so many therapists and the only ones who actually helped or made me feel semisane were the ones who had experience with borderline. You are not bad you are not mean you are not evil. Chances are you are just a hurt person who needs someone who will be there and validate them . The right therapist will do that...Honestly the most important thing you can do right now is STOP DOING DRUGS. I know how stupid and inane that sounds. I know its not that easy. I know its going to hurt and you are going to feel like shit. But if you want to get your life back you need to stop doing what youre doing. You need to get to a place of cognitive awareness.And to answer your questions I believe there is hope for all of us. I believe that we suffer from a fucked up mental illness that masks our beauty. I believe there is a bright side and I wont give up until I find it. I hope you dont either.lt ,BPD,cmcilrm,2,t5_2qqdp

2528982,0,t3_2om0e0,For someone who is nervous about posting youre pretty eloquent and thoughtful. There is a treatment called Dialectical Behavioural Therapy DBT which is the gold standard for borderline treatment. If I neglected to mention it I would be doing you a disservice. When you ask things like Any little personal tricks? my ears perk up and I wonder if you are in denial about the serious nature of the illness. If you have it trying to manage it yourself is going to get you in trouble. Your best option is to seek professional help. That said poor BPD behaviour is aggravated by stress and alcohol or hard drug usage. Its imperative to keep your body as healthy as possible and your life stress free. Keep your life as simple as possible because big stressors bring out the crazy. Meditation andor mindfulness is a key component in DBT and should be manditory for anyone with BPD. I think the single most important thing you can do for yourself right now is start a daily meditation routine and stick with it. Even  minutes a day to start can be helpful. Getting a DBT work book and reading up about it is also helpful. Learn as much as you can about the illness and educate yourself on it. ,BPD,cmoo9wo,2,t5_2qqdp
2532971,0,t3_2oopjp,I have read it twice but not recently. What amazed me about the book was how incredibly lucky Reiland was to have both a strong supportive husband and a dedicated and talented therapist. Almost any borderline would thrive with that kind of support although its so rare as to be almost fictional. I also have a very very hard time with Reilands characterization that she has recovered. I have seen far too many recovered borderlines fall apart when persistent stress hits them or if they lose large parts of their support system. Despite all that it really is a great book and it offers an alternative treatment to the almost cultlike devotion that many have to DBT. ,BPD,cmp71w9,1,t5_2qqdp
2537576,0,t3_2oqmpo,NonBPD here currently in long over due therapy to make sense of what went wrong with my marriage understand my ex and heal from the traumatic experiences Ive lived through.  One of the first things my new psychologist did was ask me to read a book on the subject.  The book is equal parts enlightening regret invoking and emotionally shattering.  Despite the difficulty Im having with the book I wish I had known any of this when I was still married and able to act on it.  My exs behavior terrorized me.  I loved her I couldnt understand why she was doing what she was doing.  At the time she wasnt diagnosed and didnt want to get therapy.  In the absence of a reason for her behavior I had to assume it was intentional and that her destructive actions were specifically aimed at me.  Understanding is half of the battle.  During the marriage I had absolutely nothing to navigate my partners behavior with.  I loved her I just wanted to be able to live without fear and despair running my life.  All of that being said its still an emotionally draining read.  Some of the knowledge invokes a lot of regret and difficult worldview modification.  I can understand why books like this have a bad reputation with people that have BPD and I dont think its an appropriate read for them.  For partners of people with BPD its a desperately needed life line.  If I had this info  years ago my life and my exs life would me immeasurably better right now.  I understand the fear you probably have but I think you should let your partner have some tools to understand his situation.  Even if I couldnt have changed a single thing about my partner I could have changed parts of myself to have a decent life.  I dont see my partners past actions as crazy I finally understand what she was trying to accomplish.   ,BPD,cmpspns,7,t5_2qqdp

If you look at the DSM before it even gets to the  diagnostic critieria it says that a person with BPD must show a pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships.Getting more specific to the Why...well we dont totally know. It might be biological. It might be environmental. I think it is probably a mix of both. But I also think it is important to focus on what is effective and that means turning attention away from why and towards how.Imagine if I could tell you without dispute exactly WHY things are the way they are for you? I dont think it would really help that much. At a certain point we need to focus on HOW to effectively manage our emotions which I think is what the big problem for people with BPD is our intense emotions that we sometimes have difficulty controlling and that sometimes result in unwanted behavior.I dont really know why BPD exists.

I dont avoid it entirely because that would eat at me but if something seems like a ten I try to bring it down to something like a six or a five. Stressful but not where Id run away.I usually start with something where I have a topic to discuss but I feel very uncomfortable and describe the feelings associated with it in some cases Ive told people that I feel like running out of the room that I have butterflies in my stomach etc. Sometimes the therapist is able to talk me through it sometimes I end up waiting to the next session.

I have been on and antidepressant and a mood stabilizer for about two years. I still get urges to self harm the more stress the more intense the urge. I have not cut in  years. Its hard and sometimes I want to give in but I dont because I want to fight and the times I dont I go to someone I can trust until I can manage again. If you are using these medications and they are working I would keep using them until you know for sure you wont relapse that you have great support and if you have an episode or a relapse you know the resources you have to get back on track quickly. If you really are feeling strongly about not being on medication I would listen to the doctor on how to wean off the medication as well as keep my therapist up to date on how I was feeling and if any thing out of the ordinarily happens like self harm obsessive thoughts more episodes more anxiety whatever it may be. If I had an infection and to get better I need to take an antibiotic  I would take it. Same goes for a sick brain.

3122662,0,t3_2vwkxj,I love running. LOVE it. I could go on an on about how great it is but Ill try to stick to some brief points about what I like about it. You can do it alone. It can be great to get away from other people for a bit.  Going for a run is perfect for this. Easy meditationa good easy run is like a shortcut to all the mindfulness stuff that we learn in DBT. Achievement. There are so many ways to feel a sense of achievement with running basically this is the Build Mastery DBT skill. I feel achievement when I go running even though Im tired from a long day of work. I feel it when I nail a hard workout. I feel it when Ive conquered a new distance or have run a certain number of miles per week. I feel it when I set a PR personal record.  Note it is important to ONLY compare yourself with yourself. Rule  of running there will ALWAYS be someone faster than you. Always. So dont compare yourself to others...which is a pretty good lesson about life in generaltheres always someone richer sexier etc. than you.  The goal is to be the best version of YOU. Physical Exertion. So many benefits from this.  The Runners High is VERY real and I love it. Plus running helps me sleep better AND it seems to mellow out my mood.  After a good run I just feel GOOD. Even if I had a really bad day at work I feel great after a good run. Id like to run before work but I have to be there at ...so a prework run especially in midwinter does not appeal to me.  Body Image. I have...not the best body image.  And I find that running helps with this a little but buyer beware exercise addiction probably sometimes goes along with eating disorders. On the whole running is on balance more positive than negative. Geeking out. Im a nerd! And if you are a nerd too then you might really like running. There are so many geeky things about this sportGPS watches spreadsheets to log miles all kinds of training plans SHOES so many shoes. All kinds of distances paces workouts...the list goes on and on. Running is perhaps the sport for the nonjock but jocks and enjoy running too.Theres probably other stuff too but thats just off the top of my head.  Getting into running is VERY simple and much easier than you might think! You could be running your first K race in just  weeks! And I would love to help you! Seriously! AMA!  Im not an Olympian.  Im not a coach. But I do know a fair amount of the dos and donts of running I know a LOT about the donts...Ive done most of them in my time...,BPD,colnvcf,2,t5_2qqdp
3132525,0,t1_comoc2v,Your question about science makes me think of the problem with all these studies. The study of socalled mental illness is not truly scientific it is all inferential. In other words these are all quasiexperimental studies because they are studying human beings and you cannot adequately control for all the constantly shifting factors. Also the reliability and validity of BPD itself is suspect so that is another problem. With human behavior... it just cant be studied like something in chemistry or biology.If any one of these studies were peerreviewed it wouldnt make any difference in the bigger picture. Because one quasiexperimental study does not prove anything. There has to be a pattern of many quasiexperimental studies pointing in the same direction to give any strong evidence that something real is going on unlike a truly replicable experiment in the hard sciences. And there are many that suggest that people labeled with socalled BPD can do quite well in therapy. As for how many of these are peer reviewed I dont know. Have you looked into it?,BPD,comon49,2,t5_2qqdp
3158734,0,t3_2warm2,I knew someone once who said she sucked her thumb through college. She actually walked into her dorm room one day and caught her roommate sucking her thumb she said it was the best day ever. What are the odds?I bite my nails. Its awful but I find it calming. I guess its something thats not thumb sucking but sort of socially acceptable. I know some people who play with their hair. I think generally what happens as we grow older is that were expected to find more grown up ways of self soothing like hot baths tea meditation rubic cube knitting and whatnot. In my dbt group the facilitators made us a starter kit for self soothing the idea was that it gave us something to start with and we could add to it. It was really nice and made me feel cared for. Theres a smooth stone in it that I found soothing to rub. I sometimes carry similar objects in my pocket that are soothing.,BPD,copefo1,1,t5_2qqdp
3206045,0,t1_cotug1x,Well I am particularly afraid of being abandoned by that friend because I know he abandoned completely broke contact with quite a few such friends  although for some I know it wasnt his fault e. g. one lady has BPD too and she tried to ruin his life that was much prior to my diagnosis and I myself advised him to get away from her as she acted dangerously insane... thats why I imagine I must be freaking him out and even more appreciate his support. I guess I am telling you this so that you see I think you are an awesome guy for staying with her and being so supportive. Anyway to keep my fear of abandonment bearable I sometimes ask him some variation on the theme if he will abandon me he seems annoyed and confused by it but duly assures me he wont and then I am fine. Also if he isnt answering my message for longer than expected I get extremely worried  he tends not to do that any more after I freaked him out by not answering to him or anyone for weeks while planning suicide his last message was what finally stopped me from committing it. So I guess do reassure her you wont be leaving her however many times she asks do promptly take care of her needs or assure her you will as soon as you can dont ignore her dont tell her about your abandoning people. Keep telling and showing her that you want her and need her in your life that she is making it much better  e. g. it helps when he asks me for some small favor easy enough for me that I can do it without panicking but preferably what wouldnt be easy for everyone and thanks and praises me for doing it. ,BPD,coub0mh,1,t5_2qqdp
3215854,0,t3_2wyett,That is absolutely awful but you need to understand that a relationship is a twoway situation. She didnt come into your life and ruin it you let her! Just as any victim lets the perpetrator do it. You need to focus on yourself instead of her and figure out why you let her bother you and why you kept her in your life for so long. You may be codependent or something and that is something therapy should address but if it doesnt read up on it. Keep yourself busy with things you like toneed to do and meet new people not to date! the reason  I say not to date is that you first need to figure out what patternissue with yourself allowed you to get into a relationship with this person and to then let them abuse you the way they did. Most people would have ended this at the first red flag despite threats of self harm thats manipulative of them and something you should only respond to by calling an ambulance to the persons address never by indulging them with your attention. You will be safe from this once you figure out what allowed you to let it happen because then you will be able to stop it from happening ever again! I hope this helps ,BPD,covbpvb,1,t5_2qqdp

3268481,0,t3_2x8jae,Programs oriented towards recovery of BPD afflicted often arrive at this problem as relatives and friends sometimes ask doctors or psychologists for help.In reality the person will be hurt and the exact reaction will depend on the subtype of BPD. Your final paragraph is a good thing to include into your conversation.There are three guidelines taught for such breakups Be assertive and avoid saying you are sorry or other emotional cushions. They will leave you vulnerable to manipulation and perpetuate the idea that youll change your mind or can be made change your mind. It seems counterintuitive to be rough with BPD but many of them will cling to I am sorry part. Such rudeness is not meant to insult the afflicted person but to clearly demonstrate you stand by your decision.This also means cutting any possible channels of contact  you need to be resolute so no Facebook friends mail or other lifelines for contact. Also do not give the idea you will renew contact if he gets better  this is a very common mistake. Some of the afflicted will see this as guarantee they can renew the contact. Remind him that you are not doing because of him or yourself but because of life circumstances that you cannot control. Although it is suggested that you try putting himself into your shoes this often does not work with borderline as they may see this as insulting. Try to blame general life circumstances as they are not either personal or tangible for him to act upon or expect them to suddenly change. Note that is extremely necessary for your emotional selfpreservation and is not related to anything else. Most people afflicted with BPD understand the need for selfpreservation well and the idea should resonate with them.I am a bit worried youve mentioned he is male and was in prison as borderline afflicted are a very heterogeneous group when it comes to adaptive behaviors towards environment. Is there a change he could be violent? If so plan for this. Also do not forget to notify your friends in common of your decision and how strict it has to be for your well being. It is likely he may use your friends in common to apply pressure on you or try to turn them against you black or white thinking.,BPD,cp0u0nz,1,t5_2qqdp
3290972,0,t3_2xsx6f,This may be true for some people who have BPD.  You might not be that person.  The percentages of a positive relationship with someone with BPD arent that great.  Its part of the disease.That said not everyone with BPD is guaranteed to be violent or cheat or be otherwise abusive.  People arent carbon copies of each other.  Our brain chemistry is as different.  We act and react in different ways.  You see plenty of horror stories about relationships with a BPD SO.  It isnt always so.  Again the stats are necessarily positive but nothing ventured nothing gained.Has my wife ruined my life?  No.  She certainly has made it a hell of a lot more difficult.  I can live with difficult.  I didnt sign a contract that life would be easy.  It is what it is.The sub I assume you are referring to contains a lot of people who have been subjected to some very extreme cases.  No one deserves to have to live with physical and emotional abuse.  I certainly wouldnt recommend that someone subject themselves to that.Sweeping judgements about BPD relationships are based on ignorance bias or recent trauma.  Consider the source.

3475344,0,t3_301t8l,As Frozeninreddit mentions such supplements may be helpful. There are some people who merely find themselves treatment resistant with psychotropic medications and if thats your case alternative treatments may be beneficial as they tend to have the same if not similar effects on the brain and neurotransmitters yet usually will less side effects. Ive been on over  medications and after being on SAMe a megadose of b magnesium for my insomnia and EPADHA for three years i can say with a lot of certainty that the supplements helped me a lot more. Thats only because i seem to metabolize medications slower than most as i tend to get  of side effects listed on medications  you could be the same or be different. Personally i do better off of meds. The problem im having right now is withdrawing from the meds i was forced onto Wellbutrin as you get horrific side effects when you try to stop  and it takes up to  months to withdrawal. I definitely want to be back on the alternative treatments as i found that the most helpful along with an individual therapist for the processingemotional aspect and a DBT skills group for the accountability mindfulness and skills aspect. People with BPD do tend to have serotonin abnormalities which could explain why you benefited from the Celexa. There are theories that BPD isnt helped with psychotropic medication as somebody mentioned below i believe but if you read the actual physiological research....it goes to show quite the contrary  which explains the impulsive actions found in BPD the aggressive episodes not explained by the anatomical abnormalities etc.When it comes down to it i live a holistic lifestyle and i believe that medication should be reserved for emergencies and as a last resort when all else has failed. Be careful with medications like xanax as they not only can alter your mood making you suicidal but can cause memory loss and you can easily become dependent. Also a lot of medications have side effects that doctors DONT tell you Ie. it was recently found that nearly  of patients taking antipsychotics experienced violent outbursts while having no history of such  which is a side effect thats not well known. I remember experiencing such and telling my doctor yet she kept telling me that i must have randomly become psychotic and kept increasing my dose.In the end try DBT if you havent already CBT andor schema therapy  theyre the most empirically supported in terms of therapy. Use medication as a last resort and if you feel as though something is or isnt working  tell your doctor asap so they can change the dose and if needed change the medication. It may be hard sometimes but ive found that being really proactive in your treatment and your own health can be so beneficial. Best of luck!,BPD,cpoey0a,1,t5_2qqdp
3485526,0,t1_cppkf8x,Every organization has its own protocol on separation so I would look into your HR documents or something along those lines. At my old company the standard procedure was to inform your direct supervisor who would in turn get in touch with all of the other relevant branches of bureaucracy. You should be fine either telling your manager or your HR department. I actually had to work at that job for another few weeks after giving notice more than the standard two weeks and felt really awkward about telling people but I made sure to speak personally with coworkers who I was friendly with so as to not burn any bridges. I knew that I wanted to leave for a while and also got pretty into taking control of my finances at around the same time so Id saved up enough money that I knew I could be okay for a few months of unemployment. I started searching for jobs pretty much immediately after making my decision to leave though and was fortunate enough to have gotten another position shortly after. Job hunting isnt fun but if youre diligent about it and openminded there are a lot of resources out there for listings. FWIW I was also terrified that people would be gossiping about me. I was in a weird social situation at my last job as well and thought the scrutiny would be unbearable. But at the end of the day I made it through and once you walk out that door you literally never have to relive that moment again.

I liked the lingering sensation of pain that bruising and burning leaves behind.I tend to binge eat uncontrollably at times and sometimes I withdraw from eating for awhile out of guilt. There are weeks I can commit to healthy eating then there are weeks I lose my shit completely and its impossible again.I rage at things. Im not sure if they are triggers but sometimes people will say something that rubs me the wrong way and I cannot control myself verbally. I will and have to rant and rage until I feel better I can be incredibly nasty when Im stuck in that place. what my boyfriend refers to my angry kitten phase.When Im stressed I detach and check out like Im outside my body. When I think back to times when I was stressed and try to remember its like Im watching a movie of someone else.Sometimes I shut down completely feel paralyzed when one thing goes wrong. Like I cant find my shoes to go to a party I was excited to go to all week. It feels like a black hole sucks my happiness away and unless I can find those shoes nothing else will do I cant go to the party I cant do anything. Physically I literally shut down I cant move every effort feels like Im moving a thousand tonnes. My insides feel crushed and my throat is tight I feel rage intense sadness and depression and guilt. sometimes all at once. My boyfriend especially hates that because I sometimes find it absolutely impossible to speak as well and he hates feeling shut out.Rage wise I sometimes clench and contort my muscles I feel particularly fearful and dangerous I will lash out when Im like that sometimes I throw things while enraged. Sometime absolutely tiny things could set me off like my phone not opening a browser fast enough.Random mood swings. instantly happy sad or depressed at any point of the day.I seem to build my self around others. if others enjoy something Ill enjoy something. I have a difficult time knowing what my own personality is separate from others. Sometimes I feel empty and hollow like I dont exist and I dont know who I am when others arent there. I hold on to labels to fit in better or with a group of others so I feel like I have a place.When I love someone I love them totally they can do no wrong. That can flip like a switch though and I suddenly revile their very existence and it feels like I never even loved them. Or I feel nothing at all for them. No empathy no sympathy just emptiness like they dont exist and if they died I really wouldnt care.I get uncontrollable surges of energy where I just need to FEEL something. Usually I want to run really hard or exersize till I hurt the feelings turn more and more negative if I hold off on doing them. Suddenly I want to vomit cry scream rip my hair out or demand my boyfriend beat me until I feel better.  Luckily most of these are averted by my boyfriend wrestling with me. when Im unlucky Im alone and have trouble coping.Theres more probably lots more. Its just hard to think about which reminds me of another problem I have Im forgetful. I usually forget that things have been bad that I have rages and other things. When I get happy suddenly those things never happened and if I let myself I forgot completely. I can go to bed one night crying and raging feeling like my life is going to end only to wake up the next morning feeling bright and optimistic. It feels like I just reset every day to something new. Nothing past that day exists. Its weird and its why I never really realized I had the BPD previously...What are you like? You dont have to answer if your uncomfortable but Im interested to know  ,BPD,cqk0y4l,1,t5_2qqdp
3759956,0,t3_33gznn,Hi and welcome! Im a  year old female and Im bisexual. This is probably irrelevant information though because sexuality is not normally tied to mental health at least in my opinion. There are many people with BPD who are straight gay ace or trans. Sharing the same disorder does not mean sharing the same lives.Im proud of you for resisting selfharm despite being in such a low state! As you know its a terribly destructive habit that is addictive and hard to break but youve already taken a large first step toward bettering yourself. The unknown is certainly a scary thing to face and feeling as if youre being abandoned in your time of need is one of the worst experiences a person with BPD can go through. However it seems as if youre staying strong despite these difficult times. I hope that can give you some hope and strength for whats to come.Good luck!,BPD,cqkv2lb,1,t5_2qqdp

3780690,0,t3_33prtw,Struck a chord with me. Im  and have no friends because I have had the same issues you described. I do have a very supportive SO who knows about my mental illness and does what he can to help mostly reminding me to take my medications and letting me bounce things off him to figure out of my thoughts make sense or not. I have improved a ton over the past year and a half and consider myself partially recovered still occasionally symptomatic but mostly functional and can be completely normal for weeks at a time after DBT and medication adjustments but I still have no friends because its difficult for me to even want to try to make them. Even though I know how much better Im doing I still figure Ill just lose whatever new friends I make just like I lost all the others. To answer your questionsgt. Have you been abandoned by friends?Yes. Constantly. Each and every one of them sticks in my mind. In hindsight my symptoms first started to appear when I was still in elementary school. My best friend of a couple years slowly started to make friends with a new group of kids and instead of being happy for her or even feeling a little left out I went batshit. I was probably around .gt. Did they end up hating you?As hard as this is for me to face I think most of the friends who have abandoned me probably are indifferent toward me now. They were probably angry with me at first but I dont think any of them hate me. Just dont really want anything to do with me. gt. Did you ever recover?Yes and no? Ive recovered from each loss though it still hurts to think about what might have been. I dont think about most of them often anymore just the ones that are still relatively fresh. And even those I think about less and less. But as I mentioned above its definitely had an effect on me. I dont even want to try to make friends anymore because of my past experiences. gt. Did they ever come back in your life down the line?Nope. gt. How do you trust yourself to make new connections and not go back to unhealthy patternsI guess thats where I still have more work to do. Im on an extended break from therapy with my former therapists blessing. I felt that the changes Ive undergone recently were so significant that I just needed time for everything to sink in. Ill go back eventually when Im ready to start doing some more work. But right now I dont trust myself at all in this area. I do play online games and Ive started trying to branch out a little with talking to new people there. Its lower risk and I can practice my skills. If it continues to go well without me getting too attached and clingy maybe Ill be ready to try more.,BPD,cqn85n3,5,t5_2qqdp

3886140,0,t1_cqz3j5b,I think one of the biggest things that helped me trust my current therapist is that she let me run therapy session my way. She would still ask questions here and there but not nearly the normal amount but if I said no or reacted in any of the ways I had told her about she wouldnt push. In fact she is very good at reading my body language and seeing how Im reacting and very quick to understand oh shes starting to feel this I should do this. Having that sense of control and knowing I wasnt going to be forced into talking about anything would help me calm down when I did get emotional. And it helped me feel that since she was trying to help me out with this give me that control and support by listening she was actually going to try and help me. All of this lasted for a few sessions each one shed slowly ask more questions push my a little bit more emotionally but she always willing to back off and let me do what I wanted. And now going into week  even when we talk about my triggers I trust her and can be a little less emotional and we are starting to be very productive.  I really hope everything works out with the clinical psychologist. The more you are aware of how you react and what you are going to need in order to stay there and come back the better I think itll start. I think a good goal would be to stay the whole time. And let her know that. Start the session by saying my goal is to stay here even if I get emotional or dont like it etc and in order for me to do that if I do this I need you to do this etc etc.,BPD,cqz951d,2,t5_2qqdp

Im no longer thinking of ways to kill myself.Life is good!The biggest change for me from DBT is that Ive accepted my gender identity and Ive started to transition. I dont think I would have gotten to this point without DBT. It has really changed my life.Things that worked for me are that I really committed to the therapy. I never miss sessions and I always do my homework. Also I dont smoke weed anymore which I used to smoke almost every day to cope with gender dysphoria.My favorite skills are Opposite Action Radical Acceptance Mindful of Emotions  Function of Emotions.  I think the mindfulness skills are super important and it is good to practice them for a little bit every day.Finally I exercise all the time. Running is the best antidepressant on the market!Ultimately you get what you give. The harder you work the better your results.

If you think you have something the you need to get to a therapist and have them look into the symptoms you have and give you the diagnosis. And you would be happy to know that not everyone who is diagnosed with BPD need medication. On another note self medicating is very dangerous as well and not something you should do. I would also read the bold text to the right under the info about this subreddit. Here I will copy it here for youThis is not the place to ask for a diagnosis for yourself or anyone else. This includes asking whether your symptoms sound like BPD or any other indirect way of asking. Only a mental health professional can diagnose you so if you suspect that you may have BPD proceed to the next line and schedule an appointment with a therapist.,BPD,crqxm99,1,t5_2qqdp

By my thirties I had stopped screwing things up to the point they couldnt be repaired. Now Im rather functional and fairly content with life. Over time you will learn to adapt and to take meds and avoid certain types of people and situations. It really does get better.Also I cant say enough how much mood stabilizers have helped me. Antidepressants are good but I think its the mood stabilizer that really helps me not to feel like the sky is falling when bad things happen and to not react so strongly with anger when in tense situations. And dont think your intermittent college enrollment is nothing. Those credits add up. Just keep going back and doing what you can when you can.

I repeat this is not a case of you being delusional.On the other hand...I am starting to get the sense that he does look out for you he sees the bright side of life you might be missing sometimes perhaps? if so thats great.

4554850,0,t1_ct4kan2,I second this. I had BPD at that age and was in a long term relationship from ages . My boyfriend at the time was incredibly supportive and theoretically as good for me as you seem like you would be for her BUT I needed space to figure myself out. Im sure she needs that too and if youre very kind to her her rational mind may try really hard to be with you because it sees nothing wrong with the relationship although it may not be what she needs at the moment. If shes anything like me in the relationship shell end up feeling suffocated and spiral into a depression she cant understand exactly why shes so deeply in and may act out against you. Things ended really badly between me and my ex and once I broke up with him seemingly randomly I had the longest and happiest singles high ever and just felt free to be myself. Relationships at that age especially if you have BPD can be very difficult and developmentally significant. Id advise you to just try to be very good friends and if things unfold naturally and without friction let it be but otherwise dont push her into anything or try really hard to get her to come around. Maybe her subconscious knows something she doesnt and she truly shouldnt be in a relationship at the moment.,BPD,ct4rcuq,1,t5_2qqdp

One of them actually ended up messaging me and I found out she also had BPD so that was extremely awesome in my case. Now I have another friend I can relate to and Im incredibly happy about it. But I guess Im just disappointed that she would lie to me about why shes breaking up with me and then say these hurtful things. I really trusted her but shes also young and doesnt quite understand the full spectrum of BPD and just exactly what shes done.

4882036,0,t1_cu9bwo0,I think any relationship involving personalitymental disorders requires real genuine work and patience from both sides. Its important to stay positive and remind yourself why sitting out or through a temporary mood is worthwhile youre developing a loving close relationship with another human being. Its never going to be perfect but its incredibly fulfilling and important to your own personal growth.Some times when I can register my emotions growing inside of me I get freaky internal with the mood swings I force myself to immediately share those emotions with my partner instead of letting the melodrama unfold without another opinion. Because X happened I felt Y. And that sucks and I dont know what to do about it and I dont EXACTLY want you to take it personally but thats just how Im feeling and I needed to share it. Sort of a thing. Kill it the urge for conflict and zing and leverage with words! A tiny honest humble pie!These are just things I thought may be helpful. I hope youll be okay.

5335501,0,t3_3o3041,Ive been cheated on by people without BPD there are plenty of people out there who lie and cheat and are not BPD. There are also people with BPD who dont cheat.BPD can involve emotion dysregulation splitting impulsivity. If the tendency to cheat is already there its not going to help. But I wouldnt use a BPD diagnosis as evidence of cheating.Cheating is a tough one because its often murky. You may see signs that can go either way. Or people tell you things but youre never sure because theres no hard evidence. Maybe one person you trust as honest really was mistaken. It can make you crazy. I have a hard enough time trusting people having traits of BPD does not help my worries because they can escalate. Ive had people lie to my face about it and believed they were honest only to find actual evidence later to the contrary. It is the worst feeling. Im not talking about coworkers telling me stories but that they slipped up and I found out. I have good reason to have a hard time trusting people.If someone already has sex addiction and a history of cheating I wouldnt advise trying to date them unless you dont care if they have sex with other people. People with illnesses and addictions can slip even with the best intentions stressors can make it more difficult to cope if youre not OK with it dont go there in the first place. There are people who dont care if their partners have sex with other people and there are people who are strictly monogamous who dont have sex outside the relationship it runs the gamut out there. You both can find partners who are more compatible ie accepting of your needs she may need tolerance and acceptance of wherever she is right now and you may need someone you feel you can trust. It will save you both a lot of stress and turmoil.,BPD,cvto3sw,4,t5_2qqdp

5363216,0,t3_3oes57,Ive heard there is literature on BPD being genetic although I have not personally seen it. To me that would make sense as I have read studies showing that the brains of folks with BPD are actually formed differently prefrontal cortex is biggersmaller dont remember which I think bigger along with some other slightly developmental differences. As far as I know these are still more recent findings. For years I have seen it stated that it is environmental generally triggered by a traumatic event in childhood most commonly sexual abuse but physical and emotional can trigger it too which kind of stunts our emotional growth right there.As for anecdotal experience although I have not read studies that prove it I would believe it is influenced both through nature AND nurture genetics and environment. I am diagnosed with BPD and for the longest time I was trying to figure out if I had some weird hidden memory of sexual abuse that I was blocking out because a long time ago a therapist had convinced me that childhood sexual abuse was the only real cause of the disorder. As far as I know I thankfully did not suffer any such thing. I do however have a father who I am now just about certain has BPD though he is not currently diagnosed. He has all of the symptoms and he certainly has enough sexual physical and mental abuse in his childhood to trigger the behavior. I am not an expert but I think it is believable that he both passed this disorder to me genetically and also reinforced the behavior in me leading by example as I grew up. It probably didnt help that my mother is a severe depressive also a child of abuse. Neither of them has ever sought help.Its really excellent that you are so on top of your health as well as your daughters.

5683627,0,t3_3svm2c,I got this handout from my counselor from Marsha Linehans DBT book released this year. Long post ahead.Biosocial TheoryWhy do I have so much trouble controlling my emotions and my actions? Emotional vulnerability is BIOLOGICAL Its simply how some people are born. They are more sensitive to emotional stimuli they can detect subtle emotional information in the environment that others dont even notice. They experience emotion much more often than others. Their emotions seem to hit for no reason from out of the blue. They have more intense emotions. Their emotions hit like a ton of bricks. And their emotions are longlasting.Impulsivity also has a BIOLOGICAL basis Regulation action is hard for some than for others. They find it very hard to restrain impulsive behaviors. Often without thinking they do things that get them in trouble. Sometimes their behavior seems to come out of nowhere. They find it  very hard to be effective. Their moods get in the way of organizing to achieve their goals. They cannot control behaviors linked to their moods.An invalidating SOCIAL environment can make it very hard to regulate emotions. An invalidating environment doesnt seem to understand your emotions. It tells you your emotions are invalid weird wrong or bad. It often ignores your emotional reactions and does nothing to help you. It may say things like Dont be such a baby! Quit your blabbering. Quit being such a chicken and just solve the problem. or Normal people dont get this frustrated. People who invalidate are OFTEN DOING THE BEST THEY CAN. They may not know how to validate or how important it is to validate or they may be afraid that if they validate your emotions you will get more emotional not less. They may be under high stress or time pressure or they may have too few resources themselves.

6096731,0,t1_cyh4ep7,We recently had a post in rbpdlovedones that I felt was very hateful and misinformed. I feel that the extreme view the culture of the subreddit takes can drive more moderate people away. I joined that sub looking for support and was initially turned off by the ignorance and anger. I only found that sub after posting here in rbpd and receiving a message from someone saying BPD WILL FUCK YOU UP. GET OUT NOW. GO TO RBPDLOVEDONES. ucookieredittor I honestly feel one of the best things we could do would be to have required flair similar to rrelationships. Something like venting or seeking support or breakup or anything else. Its hard to differentiate venting versus quality advice when people mask it as something its not. I also appreciate the insight from a pwBPD because many times it helps me get out of my own head and understand that they have a different mental process than I do. I was recently forced to talk to my ex in order to get some things and she immediately started using abusive tactics in her communication with me. Thanks to my newfound perspective of how a pwBPD tends to think when theyre undiagnosed I was able to take it less personally and handle the situation in more appropriate way without escalating and causing myself further harm. In the same way that rbpd doesnt discourage nons from posting here I dont think we should discourage people with BPD from posting there. If they were able to filter out posts for example better avoid venting because thats going to piss me off they can offer constructive input that would help us nons. We shouldnt discourage pwBPD as that in itself is segregation. We should discourage unproductive content that doesnt lend to recovery. I guess that is the purpose of rBPDSOFFA however that sub really isnt that active and I think rbpdlovedones does have people who offer constructive advice who otherwise dont visit rBPDSOFFA.,BPD,cyimwaq,3,t5_2qqdp

6176831,0,t1_cyr2czf,gtI think something people do a lot of the time is talk about BDSM isnt abuse!!! because often its assumed to be that inherently and for many of us its just a part of our sexuality that weve made peace with. But the truth is many abusive and shitty things happen under the guise of BDSM and I think we do victims a disservice by not acknowledging this and instead merely repeating the SSC mantra.Current prevalent human sexuality is largely based on pornography which almost entirely has undertones of nonconsent and exploitation of women. I believe this is where most of the problems in this area come from. ,BPD,cyrqpdu,2,t5_2qqdp

Id say you might have even more business than others who dont know what its like from your clients perspectives.

6308865,0,t1_cz6j1hv,Sorry for the male assumption. I post in an MMA subreddit mostly and its all men! Force of habit haha. And yeah thats what I was just saying. I literally just said not to look at any symptoms while doing it and just write from your own head. No need to tell me again! Ive also explained the fishing thing  I dont know what its like where youre from but in the UK pretty much everyone you speak to apart from a psychiatrist has no idea about BPD. But you have to see about  different people before you can get to a psychiatrist. For me to even get a psychiatrist appointment I had to stress that I thought it was BPD  she was at first saying it was just depression. She had to look at a BPD PDF to read the symptoms and even that was years out of date. Im sorry if it comes across as Im just wanting to have BPD I can understand how annoying that would be but honestly Ive been suffering with whatever this is for like  years and I feel like this is honestly it. The psychiatrist will be able to confirm that or not. But Ive had people previous to this step telling me its just depression despite not knowing anything about BPD. Thats the problem. One of my friends who has parents that are psychologists actually said he thought I might have BPD based on a lot of things hed noticed. While hes obviously not an expert it was enough to make me look up BPD spend hours researching it and get to the stage where Im at now.I know I need to just write my problems thats what I did.

A lot of clinics have several doctors that arent good for what you would need so you can switch mental health professionals when need be.

About the narcissistic men its something that people have noticed and brought up in various nonacademic articles but I dont think Ive seen it in academia. It also makes some sort of sense when you think about it because there is a certain element of opposites attract going on in a BPDNPD relationship except more of a dysfunctional reliance on each other. About the borderline mother Im not too sure because Ive never done indepth research on it. It is again something that probably makes sense because a borderline mother might split on a child and consequently influence the child to view things in an equally black and white manner. ,BPD,czlthof,2,t5_2qqdp

6480429,0,t3_44duht,I wish I had proper advice for you bud! I empathize greatly though. I pretty much do the same as you except in a much less corporate environment. Construction and oil field primarily and I am an unskilled labourer at that. The worst part is that they notice it and seem to get cold as fuck shortly thereafter. So I feel your pain. I just asked myself if it could possibly be a crush I am also a dude and immediately said no. Then I thought about it and if that guy is not good looking or doesnt seem like a father figure I dont get sucked in. So maybe sometimes? All of those previous experiences ended pretty much the same way as yours just did. Feeling hurt and rejected and totally humiliated. Me feeling like the worlds biggest tool for a week or a month till I cant take it anymore. I then either stop showing up and change my number oh ya...god forbid I accidentally pick up a few months down the line and get my ass chewed out while at a party this happened to me once or flip the fuck out and quit in a nuclear explosion of emotion that nobody saw coming and walk off site giving everyone the double fingers.....always while crying. Either way I have zero references for my current resume because of this and zero previous work friends. This is something I have only just recently discovered about myself. Pretty sobering realization. I have had so many damn jobs and so many of them follow this same pattern. It is important to note the idealization and devaluation pattern. You may have failed to catch it this time but next time you might not! You are aware of the pattern and that is a huge step in the right direction. I bet you catch yourself the next time!One thing I learned long before I realized WHY this always seemed to happen is that I needed to stop putting myself out there. Like at all. When I hit  or  I attributed my past work failures on me stretching myself too thin. Taking on too much and trying to be a model employee in my mind was the reason why I kept leaving jobs. Obviously this wasnt the whole story but now I always quadruple check with myself first before I take on extra shit. If I need money or just want to gain experience sure but if I at all think it is because my boss is cool and I love working....I dont do it. Because bosses are rarely cool and  hour work weeks fucking suck. I would write it all down now. Like on paper. It is a great exercise to help you remember things and for some reason at least for me when I write with a pen instead of a keyboard I remember it in a less emotional way. Like putting it on paper diminishes the power of those emotions. It is also amazing for helping you cope with a bad memory I find it cathartic. Dont kick yourself over this though. It could be worse. My exalmost fiance once said she thought I loved her dad more than her. It was probably true. I keep forgetting you didnt just quit. Haha seriously...that is how close to home your post hit. I honestly have no experience with sticking around. If I had to take a stab at it....I would say make the email as short as possible. Like not much bigger than my opening paragraph. Shorter if you think you can get your message across. Just say some personal issues came up and you wont have the time to contribute effectively to the project. That would be  truth to me. If he asks what personal issues....I dunno. I would assume in an office environment you could say it is personal and leave it at that. You likely have a human resources department that would agree. After that just do what your job description says and do it well enough to sleep at night. If you do hear of a project you would be interested in definitely go for it but make sure you are doing it for the right reasons. edit Haha he probably isnt a narcissist.....I always think the worst of someone when this happens to me. Paint them all black and forget about any of the good qualities they have.  ,BPD,czpmha3,2,t5_2qqdp

6580331,0,t3_45ryxx,I which I had your ability to disguise myself as someone who can function in society. I mean I can imitate other peoples likes and dislikes and I can pretend to think like they do but I was never able to keep with it long enough and would eventually get tired and just break that relationship usually by being myself. So I am usually targeted as an hypocrite because I am not who I pretend to be. Since last August I have been trying this whole time to put myself out there. My husband suggested me this as he knows my true self and encourage me to embrace who I am and just let me be. But it hasnt really work as expected. I might feel less fake about myself and I am discovering things that I actually like but I also feel more judged misunderstood and criticized than ever. The thing is the more honest I am the more I sense myself from being different from others. My true self can come up as arrogant or bitchish. My husband says it is because of the way I express and hints me to try an be more casual but the truth is I wasnt taught how to be casual I was taught how to be proper and respectful and yes a little bit of a snob. I mean I am from the idea that older people shouldnt be tutored but addressed as Mr or Mrs. I also hate being called a Miss as I feel that since I am married and mature I should receive the respectful title of Mrs. Anyway back to your question I disagree with your therapists. I dont think being yourself is the real solution. I think it is learning when you be yourself and when  to retrain. Society expects people to behave and think in a certain way so when you dont you can come off as weird and get rejected. They say that you will eventually find some people who accept you and enjoy who you really are and that those people are called friends. I have never met anyone like that except for my husband or family.I guess what I want to say is be partially yourself.,BPD,czzykgr,4,t5_2qqdp

6635579,0,t3_46jpiv,I can completely understand both sides. Im sort of in a similar but not exact situation now.In my situation I see it as both of us being in the wrong. Im asking for more than he feels like he can give but his response is to give even less. I could handle less affection and less time if he could meet me in the middle and check in more consider my feelings more or be more reliable.I cant tell  but it sounds like youre thinking a lot about the things hes not giving you and thats really affecting your view of him and the amount of extra pressure youre putting on him. You cant help the pressure you put on him...honestly...youre feeling really scared and you dont know where to turn and by dating you he kind of opened that door to make you believe you could get all your needs met there. But we have more needs than the average bear and sometimes were going to have to let go of some of those and just learn to trust considering that most people arent going to be able to give us everything we need and when they do we usually end up being more childlike than adultlike. I dont know if Id jump on breaking up yet. Hes been somewhat inconsiderate yes but he otherwise doesnt sound like a completely terrible negligent person. He might be feeling really controlled which can lead to resentment which can lead to him deliberately not doing everything he knows you want which isnt necessarily right but its something that happens sometimes psychologically for some reason...Maybe consider thisTake all your fears of abandonment your hurt your rage your disappointment...visualize all of that however you want...then visualize placing them in a locked box and setting them on the top shelf of a closet in your mind. Lock the box. Put the key in your pocket. Shut the closet door. Walk away.You are not abandoning yourself or those thoughts. Youre acknowledging that they are important and real and youre keeping them safe and acknowledging their value to you...youre just setting them aside.Now go and visualize him. Put yourself in his shoes. Try to imagine what he must be feeling. Get creative with what you imagine. If your kneejerk is to imagine that hes tired of you and planning on leaving go ahead and imagine that. Also imagine that perhaps he isnt planning on leaving but what else is he feeling? Oppressed? Controlled? Maybe sad in that he loves you but cant figure out how to help you? Does he feel angry? What is he experiencing? Experience complete empathy here. And try to picture yourself from his point of view without judgement. Dont judge your words or behavior toward him but just listen to things youve said and done and imagine how those things make him feel.Before breaking up consider talking to him in a validating way. Listen to him actively. No I hear what youre saying but... or That sounds really hard for you but... Just listen actively. Acknowledge what hes feeling and validate what he says if he says that anything youve done or said has made him feel that way.If he feels listened to and he feels like he can trust that you do care about his feelings and experiences that might open the door so that you can go back into that closet get that locked box out and start showing him whats in there.This could be a good way to start a more productive discussion with greater empathy on both sides. It sounds like to make this work a middleground is going to have to be reached...one where he makes a couple sacrifices he hasnt been making and you let go of controlling a few things such as him checking in before going out with friends after work for example...it doesnt have to be that specifically but you can start with something small.Thats just my perspective on it and something Ive tried to do in past relationships thats tended to help me out a little bit. lt I really hope things work out and Im sorry youre hurting so much tonight.  ,BPD,d05oc6v,3,t5_2qqdp

6776332,0,t3_48h34g,Im not joking when I say to myself that I would kill these people for that I get this comments quite often by my parents family far friends and even therapits but I have to calm myself and no hate them for life because I know that in my country were so ignorant towards Mental Illness. They are just ignorants because im not lazy just because I want to! Im not depressed just because i want to and I cant change that by tomorrow. Dont get the guilty feeling because is not your fault and it sucks of couse but just remove yourself from those people or you can have a serious conversation with them.When I told my parents about my illness they took it personal my mom got angry and make herself the victim by the suicidal idealization that I suffer and my dad told me I was too intelligent to be crazy. i told them that I would never talk to them if they dont educate themselves and they did some people would never understand so dont waste your time and they are some people who will understand perfectly like my boyfriend my cousin and a friend of mine.,BPD,d0kdpzn,2,t5_2qqdp

Always seeing the negative side of things even to the point of paranoia causes you to be overprepared for any contingencies. If something unexpected DOES happen panic does occur but then Ive found that I throw up my hands and just go along with it because I have no choice. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt. So much of courtroom practice IS manipulative. Its just what it is. Thats the job.The only lack of fit I see with BPD and being a lawyer is fear of being unprepared. Im a control freak. I need to get my words just right and its hard for me to just wing it. I hear that comes easier with practice though. ,BPD,d19lt3a,2,t5_2qqdp

And you just have to take risks. You will have failed friendships and relationships and thats okay. Learn from it. Try not to take it personal if things dont work out.

7222624,0,t1_d1z53ib,I was thinking earlier today what I need to do. For example last night I felt excluded from a game of poker and started a scene and yelled at my boyfriend. Stupidest thing ever Im aware. But I thought he INTENTIONALLY left me out I wrongly ASSUMED it was a personal attack against ME.What to do next time I feel myself having those thoughts. I like facts. First ask myself Did so and so SPECIFICALLY say hey everyone EXCEPT her come here and play poker? If the answer is no which is literally almost always is then I need to reinforce that in my head. If I start thinking about the IFS then I need to keep asking myself the same question. Once I realize it WAS NOT intentional I need to think if its a MAJOR vs MINOR problem. Truthfully its usually a minor problem that I myself have created. Is EVERYTHING going to drastically change if I dont involve myself? Truthfully no. Is it disappointing? Yes. But is it life changing? No.Easier said than done...but I sure think in my head a LOT just need to start doing it out of habit so I can think before I speak up.,BPD,d1z5oxm,1,t5_2qqdp

7573094,0,t1_d330d7n, or  when I came to that realization that I truly hated myself. I realized at the time that thinking such a thing means that I must mentally ill and had a miniexistential crisis realizing thatThat hit very deep only because I shared that same sensation.I remember flicking myself off as a child at like age  maybe because I thought it would send me to hell I grew up in a very religious family. I was also adopted and told at a very young age how much my birth parents loved me and that they loved me so much that they gave me to someone else. That never sat right with me and I let myself always think that the people who loved me most would give me up. Well all that thinking has become my reality. I understand my problems and I can see when they start but I lose myself so easily when I fear a recurrent bullying or trauma event happening. I have always hated myself it is just all that I know. I dont hate life I think the world is full of as many beautiful things as it is terrible things. I like living just not being me.Absolutely how I feel I can get lost in the beauty of nature or in the feelings of a musicians work but when I am alone and not distracted or my life is stagnant I feel the need to destroy what I have.,BPD,d330vam,2,t5_2qqdp

7583450,0,t1_d343tqj,Good for you cutting down on self destructive behaviours! Its important to recognize that youve made steps in the right direction. I feel the same way about my self identity. Sometimes I get so wrapped up in how I feel like I dont know who I am and that everyone else knows who they are etc etc. The best thing to do is to not let yourself linger on these thoughts of self doubt. So you dont know who you are why dont you try to find out?One of the difficulties Ive had in trying to find out who I am is that I feel like normal people have strong preferences for food music pretty much anything you can think of. Meanwhile my interests are constantly changing and I can enjoy  maybe more like dont dislike so many things.  Ive learned to see it as a strength. Instead of framing it as me being flighty Ive chosen to think of it as me being open to new experiences.Its hard to maintain a realistic perspective of myself its hard to name personality traits of myself so what Ive found is that often friends not the fast ones I make because theyre new and exciting but the old ones who have seen me through my hardships and still decide to stay have a more complete view of who I am than I do. I tend to fixate on the Flaws of my personality overshadowing the good stuff.What do I write about? Everything and anything. Mostly my feelings lol. Specifically Ill think about past situations where I was wronged and write about how I felt in that moment. Then Ill write about that same scenario from different perspectives.

She ended things with a lot of devaluing language and behavior. She also ended our friendship with the meanest words and behavior Ive suffered. I havent felt worse. I thought I lost my friend forever and that she hated me and was smearing me to her other friends. I had hope that sometime way down the road I might understand how things went downhill and hoped that maybe we could be cordial together. In the last couple days though we reconnected. We aired a bunch of feelings grievances and apologies. Then she revealed that a couple days after she broke things off and vanished she got her BPD diagnosis. Visiting this sub and researching BPD made sense of everything that had been infuriating painful confusing and awesome about our relationship. The behaviors and struggle that it was to be friends with her all made sense. weeks ago there were so many accusations insults and rage. The history is still there but the future is really bright. I dont know what shape things will take as she works through treatment. But Ime excited to find out and participate. I know there might be some instability and there will probably be plenty of additional pain in our future.  However once the behaviors and underlying condition were all named and described through the diagnosis it was bizarrely easy for me to see those things apart from the mature and reasonable person inside.   Forgiveness came easy we reconciled yesterday. I never want to see or hear from you again took  days and a diagnosis to turn into a stronger friendship than we had before. ,BPD,d3xc9qv,1,t5_2qqdp

8150223,0,t3_4qsqws,I have always used the word grief to refer to experiences related to the death of someone close though one can use the word in other ways. Anger bargaining depression acceptance denial these are all emotions a person can go through when someone dies. But there is no prescribed way to experience grief. It doesnt go in any particular order it doesnt necessarily involve all of those five feelings either. There can also be other feelings like relief guilt humor. These are all just emotions. There is no right or wrong way to feel in reaction to a loss. About a year and a half ago I got a phone call from a friend who said I have to talk to you about something important Im coming over. Even before I picked up the phone I knew that they were about to tell me my best friend was dead. I dont know how but I just knew. And in those moments by myself waiting for my friend to come over all I felt was complete acceptance. His life was over and that was that. After I knew for sure then came the denial. Then anger. Depression then anger again then fits of laughter depressed acceptance angry denial anxious sadness and love. Emotions are messy and they are all tied up with BPD in some kind of cruel twisted jungle. Grief is something I have dealt with every day since that day. But I have also had BPD symptoms before ever having lost someone. Going through a particularly emotionally turbulent time can feel pretty similar to losing someone in my experience. But there is something different about it too. A friend once told me that the grief of losing someone is just all of your love for that person pouring out of you all at once. If you are grieving what is it that you have lost? Yourself? For me BPD can make me feel like I am not myself sometimes for very long periods of time. This past year I have gone through some of the worst emotions of my life. A few months ago my grandfather who I was very close to passed away and for whatever reason the main thing that I felt was just love. Sadness yes but at the same time just pure gratefulness to have such a wonderful and caring man in my life. I started to feel like myself again. Like my spirit had come home to my body after a long vacation and for a moment I cried messy wailing tears of joy because I had missed myself so much and for a while I felt all the love for myself that I had in me all at once. You have that self love in you too we all do. Maybe it has escaped you for the time being but it will come back. If you treat yourself like you treat someone you really love it will come back. If what you are feeling is the grief of losing yourself then I think that can tell you how much you really do love and miss yourself. Or maybe its just me and I am being long winded and off topic. ,BPD,d4wbqcj,3,t5_2qqdp

It sucks. Its like the diagnosis is used as an excuse to invalidate your feelings and make you the problem in any situation. Maybe detach a little from these people until they stop bringing it up?

Other days I feel like the worlds shittiest mother and that Im going to screw her up no matter what I do. I think the fact that were worried about screwing up our kids says a lot.

8368165,0,t3_4tpfcs,Interesting parallel...From my experience in assessing and diagnosing adults with ADHD mood instability is present but it is different than what you would see in BPD.  BPD is a personality disorder that is more often than not comorbid with other personality disorders anxiety and depression.  When it comes to ADHD affect regulation is not a central feature of the disorder.  It can be present primarily in the form of aggression but one can be diagnosed with ADHD and not have any significant affect related issues.  When it comes to differential diagnosis you start with the most prominent symptoms and cross reference those with disorders that are also characterized by those symptoms.Lastly to address another point it goes without say that not everyone with ADHD responds to positive and negative situations in the same manner.  An exciting situation wont necessarily trigger a bout of intensely excited state.  ,BPD,d5nkkno,2,t5_2qqdp

That type of person shouldnt be in a relationship in the first place. I have realized that every time Ive told someone it was to justify my future behaviors under the blanket excuse of this disorder. The only time people tell others is to elicit affection justify their shitty behavior or as a tactic to get others to pity you and therefore become your emotional caretaker  a ploy to avoid the abandonment. Youre basically holding up a sign that says Im broken please fix me. I would definitely reconsider this relationship if your symptoms are going to manifest themselves so dramatically. You need to be healthy enough to be in this relationship not resigning yourself to a state where you have to come with a warning label. Dont tell them but also dont get into this relationship until youre in therapy AND your symptoms are under control. Its absolutely unfair to another person to subject them to this roller coaster ride of emotion one that almost universally ends up crashing and burning. ,BPD,d5syzc2,7,t5_2qqdp

8472896,0,t3_459xqh,Hello! While I havent been diagnosed with anything I believe I have BPD after looking at symptoms. Some recent mood swings have includedExtreme anger due to messing up a grilled cheese sandwich around the fourth one I had tried and failed to make in two days. I proceeded to throw away the messed up piece of bread and push a chair which actually helped me find my keys but that didnt matter because bugs were waiting to come in if I opened the door.Another mood swing was when my dad said he was going to pick me up from my moms home when I still had about two hours of homework to do he let me stay until I finished it but after I got off the phone with my mom I proceeded to cry for a few minutes and the emotions slowly trickled away while I worked which led me to being in a fairly good mood when I finished. Another mood swing I had a few hours ago was that when I heard a happy and nice song online I immediately became very sad and wistful wanting to be happy too. My triggers tend to be any of my close friends making new friends or not being invited to something or seeing people that seem really happy online or somewhere or any little thing not working or going right especially more than once. Also upswings for me typically happen when Im alone and can do what I want or enjoy.  Very sorry for my too detailed too informative comment this is my first one!,BPD,d60niwc,1,t5_2qqdp

8774424,0,t3_50adxm,Im sorry you are feeling confused and hurt. I get the sense you are fairly young. From my experience a lot of young people have trouble with awkward situations. They just dont know what to say when something unfamiliar happens. Young people are also  not good at saying something that someone doesnt want to hear. Being liked is sometimes more important to young people and insecure adults than being honest with friends. Its possible she said what she did because its what you wanted to hear. But you telling her that is not going to get her to change her social habits the way you might want her to. In fact after a healthy person has time to think about what happened they might decide to change in a way you dont like. BPD symptoms and features are not your fault but they arent healthy and the goal is to control or stop them not get others to accommodate them. Great friends will be patient though while you practice doing that. I hope this helps. ,BPD,d72gx90,2,t5_2qqdp

8832732,0,t3_515zkj,I had a complete meds review last June it was clear that after  years I took Ven it had stopped working. I was inpatient at the time and I tapered over  weeks. Initially I was fine and that encouraged us to speed up the tapering but that was a mistake. I had a month of intense withdrawal and I felt the after effects for at least  weeks after that.  I take seroquel never with Ven Im not sure how it would actually help...it might chill you out make you flatter...but I cant think how it would help with withdrawal   there might be a magical chemical reaction that the psych might be aware of....if it works then go for it keep taking it while you withdraw. Advice on withdrawing? Take it slowly. Expect that you will be out of sorts so try to adjust your life to reduce pressure on yourself. Youll probably have tiny brain zaps for weeks after. Eventually it will just be an annoyance like hiccups or tinnitus. Id commit  try to avoid taking a step back if there is no recommended medical need to. I wish I had some trick or life hack to offer you but its really just time. Take your time. Know that this is one of the worse drugs to withdraw from.

8909277,0,t3_529rr3,First of all welcome. Second of all whenever I see someone who had been diagnosed with  or more mental illnesses at a young age I highly recommend getting a second opinion. Not that theres anything wrong with having multiple illnesses and not that youre broken or messed up if you do I just know that some doctors these days can be a little heavy on diagnosing. A friend of mine had a doctor that was awful for this at  he started having seizures because he was prescribed do many pills for his mental health that were mostly redundant.Third try to look at your diagnosis as a blessing instead of a curse. I was really fucked up for a long time and I didnt know what the fuck was wrong with me.  Although I did have severe periods of depression I felt like there was so much more going on. Getting diagnosed with BPD was scary at first but eventually especially after finding this board I was relieved to find out that other people were going through the exact same thing. That there was a reason for my  erratic behavior that was beyond my control.Being able to first admit you have a  problem then seek help for that problem is miles ahead of the progress some people will make in their lifetime. Try to step out of yourself and view each of your illnesses as an entity something that can be studied and picked apart until you know everything about it. Learn what fuels it and what makes it subside.Most of all own it. Its part if who you are and its not bad. It just means that youre going to need to be strong and youre going to be a force to be reckoned with when you come out the other end of all this.Theres a thread in this sub where people are discussing the positive side of having BPD I recommend you read it and go though the sub and try to focus on the other positive boards.

People things your environment  things will change. You either adapt and survive or die out. I dont know why but this helps me.Even out of stones in your way can one build something beautiful.Lets say your feel like your life is falling down around you. Theres no reason that you cant pick it back up and build something new and beautiful out of it. Maybe you lost your job. Well perhaps you apply for new jobs and find one that really makes you happy. Bad things will happen. It is truly inevitable. You take that bad shit and you mold it into some weird shit statue. Then you go inside and wash your hands and ask yourself why youre playing with poop. Thats alittle weird. You werent raised in a barn. Thats okay though. I wont judge you. This one liner turned into a weird paragraph of jokes designed to make you laugh. I hope it did.The best thing you can do for you is find help. Find a psychotherapist. Every day is a brand new beginning get up shower eat maybe go for a walk do something you enjoy. Take care of you. ,BPD,d7jfare,8,t5_2qqdp

There was a lot of feelings of omg when is he going to make the move where I turn him down and break his heart for the night I would sit in that thought for hours and ifwhen he would finally make a move it would be a huge breakdown on my end. Anger sadness and any emotion in between could come out. I couldnt stop stewing about when it would happen or that all his nice actions were only to get some later. Maybe have a conversation and give him a month or so where a kiss from you is just that and only that. A hug is just a hug cuddles are just cuddles etc. And tell him that anything more than that is fine if he wants to initiate it. Maybe take some anxiety off of the scenario. At the same time make sure to go out and do fun things dates dinners stay up talking. Go back to the roots. Im not sure if that helps at all I just know its what I always thought could make the difference in the bedroom if my ex and I had tried. ,BPD,d7nl25a,3,t5_2qqdp

9271169,0,t1_d8r234i,To piggy back on this the reason why medication isnt used to directly treat BPD like it is bipolar is because people with bipolar get their mood swings from chemical imbalances while BPD is considered to be more about the way you percieve things and react. So medication can be helpful making life easier while you figure out how to percieve and react to the world differently but it cant treat the root cause because the root cause is not chemical. I use lexapro for depression and Adderall for ADD symptoms.  I dont know if I have true ADD but BPD is known to mimic it and in either case the medication helps a lot.,BPD,d8r6rhf,6,t5_2qqdp

Its very difficult for me to let know my bf about how Im feeling and most of the times I can see he gets desperate about the whole situation. I think if you really mean to break up with your bf should be a decision for your own good if this thing is making you feel bad you dont need some extra factors making you feel worse.

9572663,0,t3_5c13ka,He still loves you. He knows your struggles and if you fight this demon as hard as you can he will love you even more deeply than if you just floated on a breeze through life. That is only possible though if you dont fight him. He is your ally and needs to be treated that way. He also needs time and space to do his own things as most everyone does. Meaning dont wear him out. Keep your own interests do selfcare and remember he needs help getting through lifes challenges too. So fight by building a life outside of him and with him. Even when you dont feel youre the focus of his attention he is paying attention. He will be admiring you and your determination to live a good life despite BPD or shaking his head wondering how this all went so wrong. And stop worrying about the past immediately. That will destroy your relationship. Just turn over a new leaf today. It might feel weird to suddenly change your behavior but it will become the new normal. If youre not getting your emotional needs met without drama thrown in youll have to find healthy ways to get it that dont put stress on the relationship. That might just be knowing he understands how hard life is for you without you talking about it all the time. Relationships with SOs need to be balanced heavily towards fun and peacefulness. A relationship with a therapist is  about you and your problems suffering issues etc. Dont treat him like a therapist. Once he understands who you really are and what your internal life is like its time to stop reminding him. Just let him see your successes strengths failures sometimes and determination. You have to live for yourself. ,BPD,d9t0y35,3,t5_2qqdp

Having a loved one with BPD is a struggle so I see no problem with venting but it is very hurtful to see so many people say ALL BORDERLINES ARE CRAZY STAY AWAY AT ALL COSTS THEY WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE like wow that sounds so black and white it sounds like it couldve came from someone who has a personality disorder.  also all borderlines are not all the same Im a quiet borderline so I do not have issues with anger or lashing out like my mother. Most of my feelings are internalized and I take it out on myself. Yes I still have manipulative tendencies I genuinely have no control over this my brain tells me not to but Im already doing it  and my emotions are always out of control and my fear of abandonment is too intense for most people to handle but everyone with BPD has different symptoms and different severities to those symptoms. I saw similar statements in some of the comments above my mom never means harm but she is still extremely hurtful. I think its harder for her because shes  and is very set in her ways and didnt know she was borderline until I was diagnosed  years ago. Fortunately for me they caught it early and I have a thorough understanding of the illness and am able to start trying to change my behaviors and learn better ways to cope at a young age.

9723431,0,t3_5ea02y, If one really has bipolar disorder and is taking an antidepressant like Zoloft sertraline or any other SSRI SNRI SSNRI tricyclic and MAOIclass or atypical antiD they need to tell two or three close friends or family members to keep an eye on them for increasing agitation excitability impulsivity compulsive behavior andor hypomania All antiDs are neurostimulants. They do work to pull bipolars out of depressive dives BUT... they can make things a LOT worse if one continues to take them when they are moving back into the manic phases. Believe me I KNOW about this. Ugh. BPD and bipolar spectrum disorders are estimated to be as much as  overlapping with BPD being in part the result of genetic or epigenetic predisposition to hypersensitivity to stimulation albeit in a very different neurological manner than is the case in autism. Conversely dormant bipolar tendencies can be aggrieved by BPD causing people who might never have shown bipolar symptoms to do so because of their extreme anxiety owing to fears of both abuse and abandonment. Joel Paris  though I do not always agree with him on the basis of almost thirty years in the clinical trenches  has written extensively on the confusion of BPD with bipolar and viceversa and while I take issue with some of it his work is quite enlightening.  The fight flight freeze freak and fry so characteristic of BPD  which many now say is really just a set of defense mechanisms for complex PTSD induced by child abuse or other overwhelming stressors  can cause increased allostatic load resulting in maniaanddepression cycling with hairtrigger temper and seduceandabuse baiting and biting. After all that it may suffice to say that bipolar can be thought of as up and down while BPD is a sideways polarization scroll down for sure of ego states and identity schemas While DBT is the initial behavioral psychotherapeutic treatment of choice for BPD and bipolar these days there are others including EMDR MBCT ACT MBBT MBSR SEPt  BCPMCSP   NARM and SPT I still use SPt as the ninth of the the  StEPs of Emotion Processing for BPDbipolar every single day.,BPD,dabmit1,3,t5_2qqdp

9882796,0,t1_davleff,So this is actually not true and I say this as a clinical psychologist with a doctorate.  In the USA at least these terms can be very confusing.  The problem is that there are two types of labels for people who work in mental health labels describing a persons training background and labels describing what a person does.  For example people who work in this field can be trained as psychologists psychiatrists nurse practitioners licensed mental health counselors clinical social workers etc.  Those are the training background labels.  The other type of label describes what those people actually do within the mental health field.  They may be a therapist a psychopharmacologist prescribes meds a tester etc.  So when someone says theyre a therapist it just means that they do therapy.  All of the above mentioned training backgrounds can do therapy and all of the above people can diagnose psychiatric disorders including masters level social workers and mental health counselors.  However there are some people who call themselves therapists or counselors who cant diagnose such as school counselors or things like that.The bottom line if youre seeing someone who is licensed to do therapy a psychologist psychiatrist psychiatric nurse practitioner clinical social worker licensed mental health counselors etc. then they are diagnosticians who are legally able to give you a diagnosis.  Some may be more highly trained in diagnosis than others however.  For example clinical psychologists and psychiatrists received the highest level of training in diagnosing psychiatric disorders while social workers and counselors receive far less.  But that doesnt mean they cant be great diagnosticians.I hope that helps!,BPD,davr2sb,2,t5_2qqdp

9905809,0,t3_5h7grg,Yeah kinda like I get obsessed with my boyfriends pretty easily and I respect their tastes and interests but I wont always fall into their tastes and interests at least totally. I sometimes will pretend to get into their interests and be as passionate as they are but I dont really like it... except my last ex introduced me to drugs and underground music which I still really like although I dont personally like his taste in music which is roots reggae. Em with sex yeah like I did sort of engage in sex with my ex in such a way where I became his sexual fantasy and understood our sex to a point where I find it hard to understand how to have sex with other people haha sounds weird but like things like touch and attitude Im a bit lost still because I basically learnt sex from my ex. But I think Ill find someone compatible with me still..What I would suggest to you is to be ok with keeping some of the interests and stuff that you did with her like if she got you into rock music thats totally cool you can like rock music. Most people form interests from being shown things so its not weird!If she got you into kinky latex sex thats cool stick with that if it does it for you!You dont have to go around picking things to like all by yourself like if someone shows you food music clothes sex that you like then whatever its cool you like it !

And see them weekly for the foreseeable future... Also find a psychiatrist for meds hopefully one that takes the time to listen to you and cater to your needs and wants unlike several psychiatrists Ive seen that treat bullshit they think you have without even delving into what you are ACTUALLY saying and then with the slightest positive change they take credit for it even though they had absolutely nothing the fuck to do with it.Sorry I jacked your thread for a moment to vent about psychiatrists.... Ironic seeing as how Im studying to get my LCSW and will no doubt eventually have to work with one or more.But yeah I dont mean to be condescending buddy but you need help and you need it now.

10018835,0,t3_5j4nkz,Its odd that you posted this because I right now am the person with BPD who can accept things rationally but not believe them emotionally. I cant say I have lashed out Ive kept all these feelings inside and its never led to a discussion about my emotions but I lose my mind on the inside every time. For me its more just I wonder why the person doesnt want to hang out casually.So with those differences in mind...I think the third friend is asking way too much. I do believe in asking for support from friends but at some point you do have to take responsibility for your own emotions. I can talk things out with my friends sometimes but a lot of the time I know this is only a demon I can face on my own because no person can ever meet all my needs.I think its fine to express that you need time and space because you are tired. It sounds like the first two struggle with it I do internally as well but accept it easily enough and doesnt cause you many problems? If you do it without explanation then it might cause a lot of issues  but if you explain what you need they have to make a decision whether or not to accept that.

10068166,0,t3_5jy24b,I guess for me it helps knowing that the pain diminishes over time and that I need to find ways to stay occupied until I feel better. I basically dont try to alleviate or stop feeling the pain I acknowlege it and realize I have to cope with its presence till it fades on its own. If Im feeling something particularly strong I can dunk my face in ice cold water or drink something ice cold. Staying busy or at least forcing myself out helps. Turning my mind away to something else when I start thinking about them helps. Getting rid of everything related to them that I might see and be reminded pics gifts stuff and being no contact helps. Mindfulness meditation and exercise help. Volunteering and helping others helps a lot. I feel better afterwards for a least a little while. Ive thought about volunteering to walk dogs at a no kill shelter. Ive taken care of other peoples pets while they were away and pets can make me laugh or their need for love and affection and their gratitude makes me feel good. Also that they need me to take care of them helps me too. They rely on me so harming myself is out of the question.Talking to people helps I spend a lot of time on this sub or in support groups also have anxiety bipolar. Hearing about other peoples problems can make me feel better. Im not alone. Or sometimes I feel like my problems arent so significant after hearing what others go throgh. Usually it does Ive been to a group that really unsettled me and it took a while to come down. Thats rare for me the vast majority of the time they helped.I read a lot of self help books after one of my breakups. I was far too old to be covered by parents insurance is the cut off  or ? medicaid wasnt available to me though I did find a sliding scale therapist for  dollars per session and that worked out for a while we went through the manual. I think someone I knew found a sliding scale therapist for  a month. Typically in my area it was  tp  so I was lucky. I found book books written by people who have BPD and there are also skills workbooks to learn how to cope with bpd. Theres also rdbtselfhelp which has a lot of info.

DBT MBCT ACT MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR HBCT SEPt SPT and NARM are firstrate for memoryreprocessing sensemaking and detachment from the conditioning programming etc.To find the clinicians To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies look here  and here  and here and for DBT specialists in particular here  If you dig a little on each page you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview them as though they were applying for a job with your company. Most MDPA psychiatrists btw are not therapists themselves they are medication specialists but can refer you to those who are and are often excellent sources of referral.  Mindfulness Meditation Try the Vipassana For a lot of people with anxiety this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now. Therapy Workbooks I got a lot of liftoff by using inexpensive workbooks like these and these and these and these Moderate Exercise Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... and it can help to massage the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy. Diet A lot of people depression mania andor anxiety eat very poorly. Junk food  not to mention too little nutritious food  will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. Highquality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind but HQ fresh especially Mediterranean  though not pizza  and Asian food appears to be best for pts with CPTSD symptoms.

Sometimes we borderlines do fucked up things just so we can hate ourselves or have a valid reason to. Doing something wrong when you know the right thing to do decreases our self esteem. Do the right thing enough times and your self esteem will start to grow. No one can do this for you. You are in control.Also Im sorry you have a physical deformity that is something you may have to eventually accept so you can work around it e.g. dont try on dresses right now try on things that make you feel good.

10418961,0,t3_5p782y,Its funny how our perception of ourselves can colour other perceptions of us which gives us validation to how we felt in the first place. Like when I was a teenager I just wanted to be pretty so I just decided to act like a pretty nice girl and even though I was a little over weight had really bad skin on my back and I wasnt very confident people gradually started looking at me differently. It took about  years of just acting pretty until people actually started telling me that I was pretty and then as the years went on it became just a thing that I was used to getting. All this time I felt pretty because I wanted to be pretty. I would even copy other pretty girls behaviours and became friends with pretty girls. Now Im over just being pretty now Im about being attractive as a person and even though a lot of people still see me as the shy quiet emotional pretty girl slowly people are starting to see me as the fun confident cool girl. You really have to start by wanting it and seeing yourself as someone first before others can. It doesnt happen over night but it does happen until even strangers in the street treat you differently. If you go around thinking youre shitty you will get that back to you its just what happens. Like Ive had moments where I think the world is turning on me and everyone has betrayed me and people have said things like wow youre really bitchy these days or you really hate men or youre not as easy to talk to anymore and that all happened within a space of  months.

This article  will get you oriented. Accurate information is power. Psychotherapy I currently use Ogdens SPT as the interoceptive th of the  StEPs of Emotion Processing to manage any time bombs that turn up but had good results over the years with several of the . . . a CBTs including REBT collegiate critical thinking schema therapy and CPT  as well as the . . . b super or mindfulnessbased  CBTs like MBCT DBT the longtime gold standard for BPD symptom management ACT MBBT and MBSR and the . . . c deep cleaners like EMDR HBCP SEPt SPT and NARMThe CBTs deconstruct ones inaccurate beliefs values ideals principles convictions rules codes regulations and requirements about how we or they or the world should  must  ought  have to be.  DBT MBCT ACT MBBT and MBSR are terrific for emotional symptom management. EMDR HBCT SEPt SPT and NARM are firstrate for memoryreprocessing sensemaking and detachment from the conditioning programming etc.To find the clinicians To find the clinicians who know how to use these psychotherapies look here  and here  and here and for DBT specialists in particular here  If you dig a little on each page you will be able to see which therapies they use. Then interview them as though they were applying for a job with your company. Most MDPA psychiatrists btw are not therapists themselves they are medication specialists but can refer you to those who are and are often excellent sources of referral.  Mindfulness Meditation Try the Vipassana For a lot of people with anxiety this stuff handles anxiety chop chop. Not sure about depression. Many of the modern psychotherapies for anxiety are actually based on it now. Therapy Workbooks I got a lot of liftoff by using inexpensive workbooks like these and these and these and these Moderate Exercise Because it is the single healthiest of the distractions one can use to yank oneself out of the paradigm for a while... and it can help to massage the brain so that it responds more quickly to psychotherapy. Diet A lot of people depression mania andor anxiety eat very poorly. Junk food  not to mention too little nutritious food  will definitely impact those who are overly stressed and make symptoms worse. Highquality frozen meals are better than McFood of almost any kind but HQ fresh especially Mediterranean  though not pizza  and Asian food appears to be best for pts with CPTSD symptoms. Healthy fats in moderation btw are known to be good for depression.cc uMoochte,BPD,dcqasb0,1,t5_2qqdp

Although I am a fairly young BPD I think it may be similar to a spectrum but not quite?? The only way I can think to describe the notion is based off of a mobile from my Spanish class back in high school based off the novel Cien Aos de Soledad by Garca Mrquez which I recommend the novel is narrated in cyclical time so it was only natural for the student artist to have drawn the scenes and joined them together as a floating ring. My hypothesis is that the borderline must repeatedly endure the same phases and manifestations of BPD i.e. lowfunctioning highfunctioning extroverted introverted until they learn how to control the disorder and how to redefine the motion thus ending the cycle and allowing to borderline to launch off into a new linear motion. By this I mean to allude to new evidence that DBTbased therapy may actually heal the wounds that allow for the applicant to match the necessary criteria for a BPD diagnosis.,BPD,ddg7ckc,4,t5_2qqdp

Being BPD I am willing to bend to his narcissism most of the time and he stays happy because things are going his way. Usually it doesnt bother me. I dont have a lot of preferences that I wont budge on.It sounds like youve legitimized his behaviour as a punishment for your BPD. Thats insane. I seriously hope you recognize just how terribly hes manipulated you. You wont defy him because you think it makes you happy but its only because youre terrified of further abuse.gt...pretty average fight that most married couples have about cleaning the kitchen just with our personal dysfunctional twistgt... he pulled a steak knife out of the drawer and held it to my throatgt... He didnt do anything just the threat. Which is bad enough absolutely. Not minimalizing it.Except thats exactly what youre doing. Youre permitting him to treat you like shit and threaten you with violence because hes a narcissist and you have BPD. You describe how rational it would be to leave but have decided not to.gtHe didnt do anything just ...Yes he did. Dont qualify anything with just. He threatened you. Youre afraid. Its not the first time and youre looking for help. Hes abusing you and you are not only letting it happen but are making up reasons to convince yourself its right.gtThis disease is horrible. Absolutely disgusting.gt...gtI need someone to hold my hand pat me on the head and tell me I am still a good person even though Im staying.Dont use BPD as justification. Its not making you stay. It changes how you think and feel about things but you can still leave and make things better for yourself.You should absolutely arrange to leave him and stay with a friend or relative. It doesnt have to be difficult if you prepare yourself beforehand. Just make sure you realize that there may be times when things dont seem so bad.

I dont think your therapist could have been less patient and understanding if she tried!I think youre trying to take some of the blame for this painful experience when you dont deserve it. I had two sessions earlier this year with someone slightly similar and it really had a negative impact on me.It can be such a lonely road suffering with anxiety and depression. It is really so important that you have a therapist you can trust and talk to about absolutely anything without being criticised or invalidated like that.If youre referring to the mental health care plan in Australia it is not too late to switch to another therapist. Its a slight hassle in that you have to go back to the GP and get a new referral but it is certainly doable.Your therapist should make you feel emotionally safe. What happened to you is not okay and it is not your fault. I would urge you to move to someone new. Depending on where you are I can try to help you find someone.,BPD,der2map,1,t5_2qqdp

I think the best way of showing how notathreat an ex is is for the person to not mention the ex a lot to the new person except when the new person asks so for the guy not to say oh my ex lovesss anime shes so big into it! even as a throwaway remark. Much better for the ex not to ever be brought up. Like the guy Im seeing never talks about her unless I specifically ask then hell answer but by him not just throwing her into a conversation like he would his other friends it makes me feel secure. I feel their bond is good but not like besties and honestly I personally would prefer not to know if they have a chat on facebook every now and then cause Im an insecure person. I personally dont really care if I meet her or not but if I meet her Id be a bit oh this is awkward unless the guy held my hand or something literally haha cause BPD insecurity hello. But I genuinely do feel OK about him and her and its because hes genuinely over her. If anything hes more over her than I am with my ex who I never see or am friends with so in a weird way Im happy theyre friends because it takes all that mystery away from him so hes not ever wondering I wonder where she is...doing...seeing because he knows and Im the mystery now. So in that way you and him being friends might actually make the new girl feel more OK with him because shed be thinkingif they were going to be together they would be but theyre friends instead because they genuinely dont work anymore. But my feelings may not be the new girls! My mums advice to me about girls is to befriend the girl who considers you a threat and try harder with her for a while than the guy so that she loses that feeling and considers you her new friend instead!,BPD,dgo0kip,2,t5_2qqdp

11747696,0,t3_67kre8,I know exactly what you mean. Im not selfharming anymore but did it for several years. I never ever cried but like half a year after I stopped drowning my feelings in physical pain I even started to cry about minor issues. I havent cut for  years now and theres definitely a connection between that and the tears to me it feels like my emotions are too strong sometimes so they need to burst out somehow  what was blood back then are now tears and thats ok.,BPD,dgrmpu9,2,t5_2qqdp
11748498,0,t1_dgrpm9u,Yeah. I didnt have enough respect for myself to be more stern and it got to this point. Ive never wanted to walk away but theyve made that choice for me.,BPD,dgrpzjf,2,t5_2qqdp

11786798,0,t3_685gz4,My first time posting here but yes I did have doubts about my diagnosis. I believed it didnt fit me. I made a post in rdepression about it.That was initially. I didnt really believe I had it. The symptoms seemed so general. It also seemed like an easy thing for her to throw at me. However after doing more research I do believe I have BPD. It was just this week I accepted it. I doubted because the psychiatrist told me I had it the second time I met her I hadnt even been talking to her an hour total. ,BPD,dgw2mp1,1,t5_2qqdp
11799850,0,t3_68cu8v,It sounds like you know yourself quite well. Theres a lot of internalised statements you have mentioned which indicate you are self aware but perhaps youre struggling with self control. Have you seen a therapist? I have just started this year with a DBT specialist and she is able to identify a lot of things from my own statements that I am not consciously aware of. Keep playing video games and immerse yourself when you are finding things to be rough. Maybe use your creativity to draw more you can find an artistic outlet there and perhaps understand your emotions better. Share your work with others youre on the right track you just need to focus. Personally Ive started drawing again and its like mindfulness or adult colouring in but better because I can express my emotions in a different medium. ,BPD,dgxjy0f,2,t5_2qqdp
