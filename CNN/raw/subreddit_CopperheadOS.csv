9804000,0,t1_daljege,Thats true. More is really better than less. Ill look into MicroG and GApps a little more see whats going on with them. Ive used GApps on a Cyanogen install but I was just rushing to get things working.,CopperheadOS,daljycl,1,t5_3a480

10177601,0,t3_5lhzn9,Maybe you can install MicroG to replace push notification and location services from Google but Im not sure its possible on Copperhead OS and in any case I think Copperhead OS will not encourage such use from their philosophy.Note Im not a user yet because I dont have a compatible phone but I like the project and follow it.,CopperheadOS,dbxor2k,2,t5_3a480
10266677,0,t3_5mzyih,A cache partition wipe wont accomplish anything. Its not used beyond passing updates to recovery not the files but rather a list of the block extents in data. Theres no reason to think that this is a bug or something that would be fixed by reinstalling or doing a factory reset. Its probably just apps and the hardware consuming power. Apps can cause power drain via system services by using them. A common cause of quick battery drain is a poor cellular connection since the radio has to do a lot of extra work. Could be WiFi Bluetooth etc. too.,CopperheadOS,dc7s8a2,2,t5_3a480
10872853,0,t1_de0ls2k,The compiler  library hardening used for the base system will be fully extended to third party apps. Its not yet the case but its planned. Enabling fsanitizeboundsobjectsizeshiftsignedintegeroverflow fsanitizetrapboundsobjectsizeshiftsignedintegeroverflow for the NDK when they dont catch bugs in regular use like the base system or fwrapv if the code has signed overflows preventing use of fsanitizesignedintegeroverflow to at least make them welldefined but if you can dedicate some time to this you should fix the bugs. Can also add fsanitizeunsignedintegeroverflow fsanitizetrapunsignedintegeroverflow and explicitly mark any cases of unsigned arithmetic thats meant to overflow with the overflow checking intrinsics. The NDK Clang also needs to have fsanitizelocalinit added and enabled by default which doesnt have compatibility concerns like trapping UBSan.The NDK also needs to support FORTIFYSOURCE. Its currently not exposed to NDK code only base system code. Its tricky to do it with full backwards compatibility so its not yet supported by the standard NDK but we dont have to worry about that if were making the app builds for CopperheadOS. It can also include any FORTIFYSOURCE extensions we make. When Android does it its only going to be possible for it to be exposed based on the minimum supported SDK level for backwards compatibility and we can do much better.,CopperheadOS,de1gh6n,3,t5_3a480
11210854,0,t3_600m2c,It is planned. Theres no timeline. North American Pixel XL support is next. Shipping to the EU can be added with hopefully not too much trouble but we dont know if we can easily obtain International radio Pixels yet and it will double the number of variants from  to .,CopperheadOS,df2qkc4,1,t5_3a480
