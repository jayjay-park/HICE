Im not sure if this is everywhere or just my local area but it may help someone to know.Also my biggest tip is that the maternity wards always seem unbearably hot to meso when the lists say dressing gownsslippersetcI cant think of anything worse lol.I usually pack light layers insteadso maybe leggingsvest toplight cardigan. Also if everything goes well you could be home after hrs.So if you have someone who can bring things maybe pack two bags.An essentials bagand a back up bag for if your stay ends up longer.Saves you dragging too much stuff around then,UKBabyBumps,dduabxw,5,t5_3iu2n
