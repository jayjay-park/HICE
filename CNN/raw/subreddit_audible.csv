Im a brewer and fan of adult beverages of all types but I really have to say The Drunken Botanist is a book I really wished Id purchased in print. There is really interesting information presented here but listening to it becomes very tedious as its just describing one ingredient after the other. Theres really no flow to it as a book to listen to but it would make a perfect table side read to flip through occasionally. All that said I hope you will learn some amazing facts about all these wonderful ingredients that make up different drinks the world over.

7132270,0,t3_4d6m3f,While I have really enjoyed a number of Jon Krakauers books I would not recommend him as a starting point for learning more about any subject especially religion.  This is partly because his style is to take a single event or phenomena and really try to examine it under a microscope.  Thats great and worthwhile but its not a good starting point.The other part of the issue is that while he is a good writer and researcher his primary expertise and background is outdoor adventuring and mountain climbing.  He is not a scholar of religion or even a sociologist or anthropologist really.If you would like to begin to learn more about religion through Audible I would recommend checking out the Great Courses series.  They are series of lectures covering all manner of topics.  Each set is presented by an accredited professor in a relevant field.  Thus there are a number on individual religious traditions and also probably one or two on religion in general.,audible,d1ouymz,2,t5_2qlq6
