985587,0,t1_chg0xwb,Yes please post some more like these. I am also more of a fan of paranormalghost films than gore. IMHO gore and slasher movies cant reproduce the atmosphere of pure white turning hair fright. Theres more fear factor in the unknown than the knife. ,shorthorror,chgbhtm,3,t5_2zzwf

9134647,0,t3_55e141,Im sorry I had to turn this short off.  I got too freaked out when the protagonist was going to eat a sandwich with mustard for breakfast.  Did a ghost come out and make him an English muffin or something more reasonable for breakfast?  Seriously though nice concept thanks for sharing.,shorthorror,d89vsem,2,t5_2zzwf

11809130,0,t1_dgyljh6,I actually wrote this two weeks ago when my neighbors accidentally bore into our power supply while doing housework. I was in the middle of the shower when the lights went out and that was after a week of struggling to write something creepy on the spot I knew at that point!,shorthorror,dgyltmd,2,t5_2zzwf
