When you ask if Malaysia is a secular state or an Islamic one what you are asking is to what degree does religion and politics coincide. You are not asking whether Malaysia is a proper Islamic state or whether they have arrogated religious authority to themselves improperly however you define it. Buddhism is also a religion lacking central authorities. Is Bhutan a secular or a Buddhist state?  The conventional answer is yes it is a Buddhist state. Buddhism is a central part of their constitution and state authorities wield religious power and it is stretching language to say no for the simple reason that the Buddhist underpinnings of the State authority is illegitimate according to some scholar. By the same measure it is wildly disingenuous to say Malaysia is not an Islamic state. ,malaysia,ciywrda,3,t5_2qh8b

1526623,0,t3_2bo64r,I didnt do SPM but in my opinion I feel that the art and science stream system is pretty messed up. It limits students abilities to join a particular  field that they may be interested in. They maybe interested in sciences but due to a fluke in their exams may not be able to achieve what they wanted to do.PERSONAL STORYI did okay for PMR but not good enough for science stream. But I always wanted to be an engineer and I figured that if I stayed in the national curriculum my chances would be pretty slim. At the start of my GCSEs Chemistry and Add Maths were part of my subjects and boyyyy did I suck at those subjects. Im talking  bad when came to tests. However I realised that I couldnt just play around anymore and started to work hard cause even if I sucked at Maths I did enjoy it. By the end of my Year  I managed to get great results.Looking back I realised that if stayed I wouldnt have been able to get into a good school for engineering. I would have done something that I might not have enjoyed. Reading this thread made me think how would other people compare. Are they forced to settle for something less then their dreams? I feel like there are no merits to the system as there are more kinds of jobs than that were taught in science and arts stream.P.S. I also mixed around with my subjects and also took English Lit and ICT. I enjoyed those subjects a lot! I attribute English Lit for my love of reading. Made me look at books in a totally different way.PPS Our History syllabus is just plain bad.PPPS If anyone wants to change my view on the current educational system pls do so.

2272300,0,t3_2l8ltz,Okay now that there is finally a picture of the label in question thanks usedap  Im of the opinion that PPIM has better things to worry about than this.  For one the composition of the label doesnt imply that the Halal logo is marking the statue as halal.  Also the Halal logo has to be displayed somewhere prominent on the label and since this series of labels has been composed to support Tourism Malaysia its kind if inevitable and understandable that the places and landmarks being promoted would also be placed near thise prominent locations.  Alright fine I understand in part why PPIM is raising this issue. Like any other consumer organisation they receive complaints about things and so have to be seen to react to those complaints.  It may even be possible to argue that theyre taking particular issue with this because they feel that Islam is under attack from liberals or whatever.  But PPIM should be focusing more on keeping tabs on the halalness of items food and services.  Issues like this are more faithrelated and outsidr their scope if they need to take an action to be seen as proactive it should be reporting this to JAKIM and letting them handle it.,malaysia,clskpxy,4,t5_2qh8b

2410787,0,t1_cm9er6q,good for whom? consumers benefit from low prices so floating the price letting supply and demand determine the price instead of having the government set it is in the longterm bad for consumers as crude oil will in the longterm rise steadily though shortterm it can rise or fall prices now are falling and is expected to continue to fall in the next couple of years though no doubt theyll pick up again eventually. But for governments like Malaysia being an oilexporting nation high oil prices are something to fap to. This recent dip has had some negative effects already Im assuming we dropped the subsidies now because oil prices have been falling so theres no better time to get rid of subsidies There wont need to be an immediate hike in prices in fact KJ even said December might see a price drop but i dont trust him lol this means BN government doesnt need to lose political support from rakyat AND can still make improvements on its accounts.

2820048,0,t1_cnomed7,Apologies if it was insulting. Its just that you contradict yourself with your own links so it implies skimming and assumptions which are misguided. gt My understanding is that it is permitted to actively promote Wahhabism whereas Syiah is bannedWhile the article clearly says it is not appropriate. In hindsight it may be a wording issue where you meant it is allowed whereas i interpreted it as being encouraged. Again apologies. Lets restart the teachings are all derived from a core of beliefs Sunni Shiah and Ahmadi not too familiar with Ahmadi to be honest all differ at the core teachings level. Hence if you follow one the others are deviant. Within Sunni you have mazhab or schools of thought. Core beliefs are the same but minor interpretations vary. i.e. can you touch dogs? yes or no doesnt immediately mean the alternative follower goes to hell its just a difference in approach. Wahhabism follows the same core as sunni schools of thoughts but is a very extreme interpretation. Being that the extreme interpretation still follows the core belief it is very hard to ban it completely as it is unclear who follows what. What can be done is to actively discourage and at times monitor practitioners for signs of danger. I understand this is Malaysias approach. This goes back to my earlier example are christian cults still christian?Hopefully thats a more acceptable comment albeit perhaps lacking due to the lack of familiarity with Ahmadi teachings.Do note i tried to be civil and polite this time. Perhaps you can do the same too with all comments. Fire breeds fire.

So that you will understand.gt DONT believe that all men and women are equalThis is another good example of where the mainstream interpretation of human rights and Islam disagree.  Where mainstream human rights advocates absolute equality between the sexes based on the idea that there are no differences between them Islam advocates equivalent responsibilities and privileges based on the idea that there are some things that one sex can do that the other cant.  A major example of this difference according to Islam is childbearing ability since only women can give birth men are given duties and rights that are intended to help them provide a suitable environment for the children to be jorne and raised.But as I pointed out that doesnt count as equality in the eyes of mainstream human rights interpretations.gt DONT question the people who want to control you for their own benefit.Muslims that dont have the knowledge or skill necessary to judge on religious matters are expected to follow the decision of a scholar or school of.jurispudence thatbhe feels is correct and trustworthy.But only so long as he believes said personschool is trustworthy.

Since the Chinese is controlling  of the economy the employers are usually Chinese.. You need to allocate sembahyang time for Malays which is an inconvenience to employers.. Most Malays usually cant speak Chinese and this can be a disadvantage unless youre only dealing with Malays.From my dad who is an employer of a factory personal opinion. We often hesitated to hire Malay girls because you always have to pay them maternity leave every year. Guarantee confirm  baby  year!. My god last time I tried to promote a Malay guy into a leader he rejected me and said he is good now and dont want to take on more responsibility..

4985719,0,t1_cumv5at,I won a phone before just by answering a question. Randomly chosen and called by DIGI rep. It was a cheap Samsung dumb phone but hey its free! Many years ago when they still had the awesome MTV plan or music plan or whatever unlimited SMS with some DIGI numbers! This was the era when smartphones were still expensive and rare before the Buddies plan was conceived anyway I won IMAX movie tickets music CDs plus other stuff I dont remember.Then theres the birthday bonus.  extra credit when topping up  days before or after your birthday. I forgot the top up limit though RM? That means getting RM for free thats like regular top up credit and didnt have an expiry date! However over the years they kept changing the policy with birthday bonus. First they made it so its no longer regular credit but under freebies. Cant transfer freebie credit for example or use it to subscribe to Super Long Life and such. The last straw was when they put an expiry date on the free credits. IIRC its one month. Ive stopped bothering with the Birthday Bonus since then. Edit Now I remember long time loyal customers were automatically insured for free. RMk? Dont remember the amount as it was many years ago. Very limited with claims though but hey its better than nothing! Wonder what happened to that?Edit DIGI promos carry an expiry date these days and I no longer bother with them. They typically offer rebates that will expire after a week. In my eyes theyre not proper rebates and I still end up paying the non promo amount since I mostly use my DIGI line for Internet only. ,malaysia,cumyp4p,1,t5_2qh8b

5063843,0,t1_cuwce1s,In case you didnt notice I was actually criticising you because you misrepresented the article and MDBs argument.  Youre right that WSJ having a PampC transcript doesnt prove or disprove their allegation against MDB but that wasnt what MDB was using to refute the allegation anyway.  Your point that MDB failed to refute said allegations would be better served has you wrote your response to me instead of So MDB has proven WSJ is falseincorrect by saying WSJ wasnt supposed to have that transcript?.gt You realize that IPIC itself is saying it does not know where the money is and says it never received it. MDB is claiming that IPIC must have received it because otherwise why would they continue to provide guarantees for the bond without collateral?  That fact is very very important because one of the ways you judge a dispute over a payment for services rendered is to check if services were actually rendered.If the payment was never made by MDB where are the reminders to MDB to issue the collateral?  If there are reminders then why is it unclear what happened to the funds since it obviously has not been paid out?  If IPIC agreed for whatever reason to provide the guarantee without the collateral then again why is it unclear what happened to the funds?In essence MDB is trying to say that if theres any hanky panky going on there its not on their side.  Just their sayso is not enough of course MDB needs to produce a paper trail on their side that shows payment was actually issued and preferably received by IPIC.  But since the matter is still under a PampC agreement I dont expect to see such documents shown to the public any time soon.,malaysia,cuwdvbp,1,t5_2qh8b

5654572,0,t1_cwxo0mr,I dont think JAKIM has a role  because the disenchanted and deradicalized returnees  are the best weapons against ISIS  and they can only be managed by the security forces. JAKIM educating the general populace without being able to control returnees will be a waste of money and time. I think the police are far better equipped than JAKIM to counter ISIS ideology because they have the returnees and more trained staff. The police have been dealing with this stuff for since s. you seriously think they dont have Islamic scholars of their own?.Separating the security and ideological aspects is not a good idea because if there is a failure  eventually there will be an attack on Malaysia you will have the police blaming JAKIM dropping the ball and JAKIM blaming the cops. People will blame JAKIM wasnt through enough or worse sympathetic  to ISIS.   Now with the Shia. Malaysia does prevent them from practicing their religion out in the openIt seems that religious authorities are just as worried about Shia. However antiShiite rhetoric disseminated through official media channels such as newspapers and television combined with sermons by some scholars claiming it is acceptable for Sunni Muslims to join holy war against a repressive Bashar alAssad has led to the perception that this is acceptable.

And while rumi is much easier to use the adoption of rumi as a writing system reflects the previous adoption of jawi as a writing system  for economic and political advantage. Both systems were adapted at a time when significant amount of interaction were done with the users of the writing systems.Revitalising Jawi is important culturally and Jawi is still perfectly usable for documentation  Islamic marriage certificates in Thailand are still issued in Jawi for example but I dont think that moving back holds any advantage at this point.

6083407,0,t3_3yvg32,The monarchy is meant to be a fourth column in addition to the Executive Judiciary and Legislative branches to the government. However having read some accounts on the monarchy in the past they have been rather... ineffective at this and has been a stumbling block to governance see state constitutional crises in the ss. This is why Mahathir attempted to. Remove YDPA power on rejecting bills passed by the Parliament and. Remove immunity.He was only partially successful on the first and was successful on the second by exploiting the media to turn on the rulers at the time. However on the first point I firmly believe that our rubber stamp Parliament needs to be checked and would argue that YDPAs ability to reject bills are or rather would be useful see NSC Bill. Until such a time when our politicians are able to discuss and debate any bills in Parliament on the merits of the bills I do not trust them to wield that power effectively and in our best interests. Our Legislative branchs subservience to the Executive is rather disheartening.IMO Mahathirs push against the monarchy made a rather nice compromise that still allows laws to be passed if the YDPAs rejection is not sound. However this is not to say that Mahathir himself was not the cause of our current problems because he is. On to the Monarchy itself I believe that they play  or should play  a vital role in keeping our Executive branch in check. Unfortunately for us the Executive has been loaded with so many powers that they need to be kept in check. Ideally should our government become more mature the role of the Monarchy could emulate that of the British Crown which doesnt interfere and lets the government do its thing. ,malaysia,cyh0kzo,4,t5_2qh8b

This is your wants Money Good Grades FunChoose .Thats how things are.That being said its not impossible for you to have fun but there will be sacrifices. You cant have fun everyday anymore. Its more like your fun days have been limited to possibly just  days. Welcome to the working world. Its like this for the rest of your life.If your job is taking a massive toll on you just quit. Trust me its not worth burning yourself out working and studying. Itll take a massive hit on your grades. Currently I am on a  month break because I burned out. So trust me when I say Im telling you this from experience.If the job isnt taking that much of a deal but you want to manage your stress levels then you should plan out rewards for yourself. For example make Saturdays Mondays and Wednesdays your Reward Days.Whatever assignment you have on those days you finish it the day before. That way you wont need to think about it on your reward days. Fill your reward days with absolutely ANYTHING you want to do. Binge watch a TV series? Go ahead. Do it all. But on your normal days? Keep working as usual. On your normal days the only fun youre allowed to have is podcasts and music. I think thats fairFor time management just get used to Google Calendar. Plan it to the exact detail and youll realize youll have pockets of time here and there. Utilize those pockets for either relaxation or workstudy.

If you are it could be that your VDSL modem isnt able to reach the mbps sync profile on the copper wiring or is capped incorrectly. You can verify this with a phone call to the Unifi hotline. Also make sure youre running the test using a Cat cable directly from your PC into your router and not over wifi as you will get slower speeds if the .GhzGhz spectrum in your area is saturated. Its rare that this happens with the FTTH based Unifi unless your area has a very high contention ratio for bandwidth but even then its usually only noticeable during peak hours.This was a common complaint back in the early days of Unifi .. as TM was deploying their Mbps with exact speed caps on the fibercopper systems resulting in people reaching the MCMC  package speed requirement but not their full package speed due to protocol overhead. I believe the policy now is to allocate your package speed  an additional  at the copperfiber caps so users can hit their max package speeds.,malaysia,cyurzs1,1,t5_2qh8b

People do do that sometimes  give you a little extra because of whatever reasons they have.

Getting one is pretty cheap its just a matter of sitting for the ceramah and learning how to ride. I am on my L license had a B full prior to this. You can check the various license classifications on the back of your license and Im not planning to get my full license anytime soon only needed if you want to bring passengers aroundgtBetween my car and future mortgage payments Im very limited in terms of purchasing a bike.Depending on how much you spend per month getting a bike is definitely more economical.At the time when I got my bike I was paying something like RM per month in terms of car upkeep my car was fully paid off which comes in the form of parking petrol toll maintenance. Going to a bike was a little over RM AFTER loan repayments which brings up the rent vs. buy argument. In this case I had something I could keep after I was done with it.gt Whats a good machine for a beginner thats not a kapcai?I was riding a KTM Duke  ABS. Absolutely loved the bike it was featherlight and had enough power to get you in trouble. The only thing lacking was its top speed and with that Id recommend getting the Duke . Check out the new and used prices on Mudah.Other bikes you can look at would be the Kawasaki Ninja  or Z. Yamaha has the R and Honda has the CBRR honestly I find its numbers to be a bit on the tame side. Id recommend staying away from the lesser brands. Not to single any brands out on a public forum but I had a friend buy a Chineseowned Italian brand and he didnt get to ride it for the first  weeks because of a dead rear bearing and dodgy brakes.Read this for more info.,malaysia,d0d3up3,2,t5_2qh8b

6731473,0,t1_d0fkxau,Well first of all you must know that I am a menthols kind of guy. Some say smoking menthols would lead to ED but Im here to say that smoking in general will lead to ED. The menthols doesnt affect the speed. How much you smoke does. I used to smoke Winston Menthols the long ones. They cost RM. and are quite satisfying. The taste isnt too bitter you cant really taste the paper and overall you just feel the cool effect of the menthols even more. Currently I am smoking Dunhill Menthols. My uncle bought a carton and gave it to me and Im in the process of smoking it. The Dunhill Menthols are first and foremost bitter. The menthols are overshadowed by the tobacco meaning you can hardly feel the cool effect in your throat. However the smoke you exhale is much thicker compared to smoking the Winstons. After smoking these after a while I also realize I need the Dunhills to feel satisfied. The nicotine difference is notable too it seems. Next is Marlboro Ice and Marlboro Ice Mint. These are identifiable by the box. If you see a Marlboro with a black box and one blue circle that is an ice. If you see a similar Marlboro box with two circles that is the Ice Mint. Smoking the ice I really like the menthol taste. The tobacco itself is very satisfying. However the after taste of the menthol isnt very nice. You can hardly notice the taste of paper so thats good. When it comes to the Ice Mint of Marlboro I simply cannot smoke it. Breaking both of the capsules in the filter will make a cigarette that has a menthol level similar to eating a cough drop. My throat gets dry smoking it and coughs are something that appears afterwards. The taste itself is not enjoyable to me as the aftertaste of the mintice is very strong. On some ocassions it gave me a headache. The nicotine levels are satisfactory and the smoke you produce when exhaling are quite big. Next up is cheap cigarettes like Nusantara League Ice Pine and L.A Lights but well leave it for some other time.  ,malaysia,d0fldh2,4,t5_2qh8b

Its the overzealousness that we should avoid here but I dont believe calling out a racist whenever you see one is similar to what the religious authorities are doing in this country.If I see a person being a racist Im just gonna call him or her out. Reactions and consequences may vary. Its not the same as putting him or her into jail like how our religious authorities are doing it here.If you can exclaim the word bastardasshole to a person who has just mugged and hurt your parents then I am only asking to treat those who uses irrelevant racial prejudice i.e. racism to be in the same camp as the aforementioned criminals.If we are to agree that racism is wrong then by all means we should agree that it is ALSO a CRIME to be a racist. The only difference? Its a crime that probably wouldnt land you in jail...at least not in this country yet.This may be idealistic but imagine outlawing all forms of racism. The utopia where to prejudice a person irrelevantly due to his or her race rather than their characteristic of an individual is deemed illegal. Saw a racist?

7882446,0,t3_4n3eh7,Ok Im pretty knowledgeable in this so Ill help out. The main vehicles for investment in Malaysia are. Property. Stocks. Unit TrustAmanah SahamFor property the safest are residentials from kk. Apartmentscondos close to the city amp near public transport are the best. From here you have  choices buy new or nd hand called subsale. For new usually they give you rebates so you can book a home for like k assuming rebates are sufficient. However new homes are almost always way more expensive future pricing has been factored in. To buy nd hand you need  downpayment  lawyer feesstamp duty cash. Thats quite alot of money and therefore many cant afford nd hand props. Generally if you buy a decent home in a decent area you cant go wrong in the long run. You can rent out your other rooms if you are still single to help out with the installments. This is usually what I recommend doing.Stocks are riskier but can have very high returns. Generally Im not very interested because picking stocks and keeping up to date with the market is extremely challenging. You are very unlikely to do better than a professional fund manager which does this job full time.Unit trusts are varied and all different. You need to know what market and what type of investments. For example some unit trusts invest in Malaysia some in China etc etc. Also unit trusts typically invest in either equity shares property or government bonds. You need to read the detailed breakdown on what they are investing in to know your true risk exposure. Also when you pick a fund you like from a bank you like you usually have to pay a  fee to the bank and also pay a recurring fund manager fee. This may or may not be your cup of tea. Personally I prefer property amp unit trust as its less messy and less risky than shares. ,malaysia,d4226eh,2,t5_2qh8b

I can literally be anything I want to be without pressure of my culture or religion. I also love the decency politicians have here. Although the political arena here can be scandalous which political system isnt? I just admire how civil the House of Commons here is compared to back home. That doesnt mean Ive had low points here. I moved here for th form and went to uni and have experienced racism a lot of the time been called paki blamed for the influx of immigrants had a bottle thrown at me told to go back on my boat back home. Although those hurt a lot it taught me about racism back home too and how it felt to be labelled and generalised when being a minority in a country. Since said incidents I decided to stand for student rep for international students at my uni here and have taken up a massively global point of view. I hope to start spreading more love and togetherness when I come back to Malaysia. If anyone has any idea how to do that let me know ,malaysia,d46dl7k,5,t5_2qh8b

8021108,0,t1_d4hl9zs,The simplest way to put it is that the opposition is saturated with problem members and similarly to the ruling government they are the ones who are the loudest and they get the most media exposure. There are members of opposition who hold lowerranking positions educated and respectable people who have a strong sense of justice and moral values fulfill their responsibilities as ministers and take the time to listen to the problems of the residents of their district. They also have good ideas for the betterment of the country and have the will and motivation to put their plans in motion but they dont receive any media coverage simply because the media does not consider their opinions or their achievements to be newsworthy. Theyd much rather write about the IGPs latest slipup or the DPMs most recent fauxpas theyll definitely get much more readers that way.It doesnt help that the opposition is separated. Why dont PKR and DAP just join into one party? Because each of them have their own agenda. PAS wants malaysia to be an extremist islamic state no one can deny that this is Hadis goal. They do not see that it is unreasonable to want that in a country with only a slight majority of muslims. Without a single united opposition with clear ideals it is impossible for them to defeat BN. They are subject to bias and clear information of their achievements and aspirations cannot be reached efficiently to people in rural areas. This is evident in that some people in kuala kangsar and sungai besar having reportedly not known which coalition party amanah belongs to and which party is a part of the new pakatan harapan coalition.Edit Ill continue this later have to go buy lunch.,malaysia,d4hnc90,1,t5_2qh8b

Is that the most Right thing to do? You seem to be pissed Im not taking comments as in ACCEPTING those comments as Truth. Isnt that kind of TYRANNY of you just because Im not just quietly accepting your accusation of my comics being gibberish?I work Comics full time now and getting Some income from it. I also work on Film production at the side and things are balancing what is there to acknowledge?gt JUST BECAUSE you are an artist and you like typing gibberish and you should not quit. When people say they dont understand you IMPROVE so that people understand.IMPROVE according to whose standard? Yours Everyone? I appreciate the advise or Critic but havent you hear me out what Im trying to say here To You it might not work To Some it might. Yet you come off as No You must adjust according to My standard. Im being Liberal here i respect Your choice of Not Liking them But dont i have a choice to reply back that Your advise is not necessary the Whole Truth? Or you are even offended by that? Does that mean in the near future when someone critize your work as in Bad No Structure No this No that and One should just accept the comments by not saying anything? Even better amend their works according to those comments? gt There are more than  options which many people are trying to tell you. Everyone who is critical here are trying HELP you not HARM you. They are spending their time typing just to help you a stranger on the internet.Again who is EVERYONE? Dont definie the Majority as Everyone.I do spend time to type this too to advise you that not necessary what you think is Not Right necessary means Not Right for everyone. Respect Ones freedom to create to have their Own voice. Art and Stories are Subjective to Ones liking. My comics might be boring to some Im okay just working for the niche.Again I never did say i dont appreciate anyones comment i appreciate it But cant you accept my reply as well that I dont really care when One give comments like no structure or that its boring cause to me they are Not.Danstoncul obviously my comics dont work for you just stop reading them I dont mind the downvotes as said My reality is the world is So big Reddit for example there are tons of Subreddits out there that gives me UpvotesDownvotes not necessary means I get Downvotes here means that my comics are entirely Bad it just dont work for some Here. Can we move on already? Ive no hard feelings of people saying that my comics are BadBoring and i hope that you dont mind me replying to that too its only fair no?,malaysia,d558pdr,1,t5_2qh8b

8247916,0,t3_4sdk20,So now supporting LGBT is a benchmark for becoming progressive humanist amp post modernist people.  According to history the people of Sodom amp Gomorrah which were destroyed amp their land turned upside down thus became the lowest place on land i.e. The Dead Sea were the people who started homosexuality.  These people they lived long before the Greek started voting long before Macedonia became the superpower of the world long before the Romans built roads to managed their vast empire.

8356883,0,t1_d5m5izg,gt these two Chinese girls who didnt understand BM or English only Chinese.Are you sure they are Malaysians? They cannot graduate from HS without a credit in BM.gt  But they were both from Johor and went to Chinese school there.I suspect they are from Chinese independent schools which are similar to International Schools. These private schools do not receive any funding from the government and students are required to pay tuition fees. The board of directors have controls over their own syllabus and are essentially a completely independent school system. But yeah in that case youre right. gt Some of the Penang Chinese students said that it was possible to get though with only Chinese but that it was unusualVernacular schools are different from chinese independent schools. One is partially funded by the government another is completely private. Both are opened to all races though. Now the first one vernacular schools follows all the syllabus listed by the Ministry of Education and learns the same materials as the national schools. However the medium of instruction is in their respective languages. For an example national schools teach Biology in Malay language while vernacular schools teach Biology in either Mandarin or Tamil with no change to the materials covered. Textbooks are the same except for Malay language in primary schools. Chinese independent schools have much harder syllabus their grade  math is equivalent to grade  govt schools math syllabus but all their subjects are in mandarin and they do not follow the national syllabusrequirement for BM. However theres nothing much the MoE can do about them as they are essentially in the same category as the international schools. As for how sustainable they are well their HS certificate is recognized by certain universities in China Taiwan Singapore and some local private Unicolleges. ,malaysia,d5m5v3t,5,t5_2qh8b

Therefore they have no actual value.gt Just as how you not accepting these arguments as reasonable makes you not believe that Islam is correct we believe in our religion because we feel that our doubts are answeredcountered by those arguments.This isnt how real arguments work though. There is a structure to logic which allows it to be used to identify truth. Its not just my logic is true for me and your logic is true for you.However as I said in another post I think thats a fools errand to try to use logic to talk about God. Matters of faith are intrinsically outside the reach of logic.

What I like about Reddit is that you could have a specific subject but the thread would often go off tangent depending on the response to a particular poster and continue from there with some interesting views to ponder.I wanted to demonstrate how ones bargaining power position is weakened if he or she has a scandal or a skeleton in the closet.I used Najibs current MDB scandal and how it is going to impact our government when it comes to negotiating with the Russians. Who knows what else the Russian intelligence have on him that would restrain him from doing what is in the best of interest for the MH passengers crew and their families.Most responses have been polite and blase but it seems a number of Malaysians feel the need to be salty and accusing me of running down the country. Its not like what I wrote is something new that the world doesnt already know. Heck I dont need to talk bad about the country Najib is doing pretty well by the looks of things.They assume I am an Opposition supporter with one went on a lengthy spiel about Anwar Ibrahim like the fuck I care.

Anyway he checked my laptop and it operates normallycan open windows only the smell and the burning chip yang problem. So since my laptop still ad warranty he said that he will suruh the guy from the laptop company to check for it and issue a replacement for the said chip. So anyway got a call a few days later and my repairman called and he said the dude from laptop company dah check and he said he check all of my other hardware and it works perfectly. My laptop still boleh operate. So they said we cannot change the defected hardware since your laptop still boleh pakai.

10092165,1,t1_dbmyvw1,Malaysia is a nation state centered around the national identity of Malays similar to how Japan is for the Japanese Sweden for the Swedish Turkey for the Turkish etc. The nonMalays in Malaysia should not expect their language to be given the same due precedence as Malay although an argument can be made for the Orang Asli. Malaysia being multicultural shouldnt matter. The nativenational language of the country is Malay similar to how Swedish is in Sweden. In multicultural Sweden all the foreign Arabs Finns Balkaners etc. are expected to speak Swedish fluently even though combined make up nearly  of the population. The Netherlands is also around  Dutch and knowing Dutch is essential for foreigners in that multicultural nation.

10232945,0,t3_5mh9kn,Japan is a very old civilization that heavily focused on agriculture rice and food like any other older great civilizations that allowed them to have high population in many areas in a feudal system. That was not enough however and due to internal pressures and ambition Japan grew to have imperialistic ambitions even before the Tokugawa Shogunate period when Toyotomi The guy who unified Japan near the end of the warringstates era Sengoku attacked Joseon Korea in their plan to conquer Ming China and Japan later challenged Chinas tributary system with other kingdoms like Ryuku Islands and Taiwan. This is the beginning of Japanese nationalism and imperialism. They stole plenty of artisans and engineers from Joseon and also adapated a lot of western technology from the Portuguese and Jesuits which made Japan a very industrialized nation when compared to other Asian kingdoms. They underwent their own industrial revolution during the Meiji restoration started from  when a group of oligarchs who were against the Tokugawa shogunate created an alliance to restore the Emperors imperial power and used it to grab power themselves the key people and their allies were in power well through the modern age and their families control the zaibatsus and financial corporations in Japan. This same group also tried to copy the western style of government and industrialization to protect their own interests over the western powers trying to exert influence over Japan as well as pride and nationalism they want to be a great nation comparable to the western powers. They really did everything they could to mimic the western powers especially the British Empire and all of these looktowest strategies and analysis by multiple political economists of how Japan can be like a western power actually started way earlier back in the Edo period even during seclusion. During the Meiji period they sent plenty of their military and political leaders to train in Europe as well as getting European experts to Japan to train their leaders and set up financialeconomic manufacturing political and military systems in Japan.When you have a group of oligarchs backing a monarchy with the whole nation being taught that they have selfdetermination and everyones moving towards the same goal its gonna be way better than a country like Malaysia where the divide and conquer system has been in place ever since the British were here. People here spend much of their time bickering with each other instead of looking at the bigger goal to challenge and compete with the rest of the world. Also because we are resource rich the postindependence leadership were just British and prowestern puppets that allowed them to control the Malacca Straits and a source of cheap raw resources for easy money instead of investing properly in infrastructure and education. Japan eventually did conquer Korea and Taiwan late searly s and in the years leading to WW they won a war against Russia gained a seat in the League of Nations expanded their military influence to China and eventually conquered most of Asia in WW.PostWW USA invested heavily in Japan as well in order to stop their imperialistic ambitions from rising again same with Germany. Japan achieved a miracle rebuilding and basically leap frogged to become a developed nation and this was largely due to the high literacy population and solid industrial base that were already in place. Japan had laid the groundworks in order to become a great nation around a century even before Malaysia started looking towards industrializing. They were already a major power in the early s when British Malaya was being exploited for tin and rubber. Our industrialization started way later than Japan so its not even comparable.,malaysia,dc3ymu5,6,t5_2qh8b

The new NuStar Xray telescope is able to see through this.  NGC s active galactic nucleus is also the faintest known one of its type.  . We have confirmed using visible light that the center of NGC  is an active supermassive black hole which has not been previously done ever for any other galaxy.. Infrared images of NGC s centre shows that its all compressed within a really small area. This is more evidence that the source of Xrays and light is a supermassive black hole.  Also first time identification of its kind again.. You know how weve not been able to find a lot of these obscured active galactic nuclei?

In other case by having some kind of leverage and in this case a diplomat who should have informations on NK and whats even better is if we hold on to NK military diplomat.

Sometimes I feel like Im deciphering a secret message ala Dan Browns The Da Vinci Code when I receive any messaging from my Malay friends on social media.One problem I observed is that some Malaysians do not have a sense of pride for Bahasa Melayu. Some at least in my circle think that the language is downright useless because it has no applications outside of Malaysia compared to English. I often argue that going by the same logic many other languages in the world would be useless too eg. Japanese Korean but yet they are still widely used. I personally blame politics for this mindset because such points were often played up at the Opposition ceramahs when the government was flip flopping between teaching Science and Mathematics in English and Bahasa Melayu.Edit My point is that learning Bahasa Melayu is not about having practical applications abroad. It is or at least it should be our national identity and pride similar to why other countries have retained their native languages despite the rest of the world yakking in English and increasingly Chinese. Personally Im proud of the fact that I can speak Bahasa Melayu. But it pisses me to no end when someone throws the its a useless language card at me.,malaysia,df5ivuw,9,t5_2qh8b

11568446,0,t1_dg76kqn,i was typing on phone thats why i cant use quotes since it takes too long vgt. This question probably influenced by some fiction or games. From the history of the prophet except from the first human created Adam there are only  person whove met Allah. first is Abraham KhalilullahFriends of AllahGod same title is given to him in old testament of Bible and the second one is Muhammad the final prophet. Even Muhammad only met Allah to receive the call for prayer nothing more. Every other command are sent by a messenger and more importantly the age of prophecy has ended  years ago so there is no more revelation or prophecy from god. Also if you look at quran or hadith there is no direct comman to kill this person at most there is a curse to this person as he oppose islam so much at that time that he abuse and even kills the new believer who is related to his house.Unfortunately malaysia dont want people to see the quran on the internet for some odd reason so i cant provide proof to my argument considering most muslims in malaysia are sensitive cupcakesgt Pretty sure PAS or the imams already told them a lot.And there goes malaysias freedom of religiongt I already clearly mentioned that dog are raped by the male in infidel army in my previous and the comment earlier. did you missed that?and you saidgt probably can simply search some lewd vid about dog and girls but its beyond stupid as you can search it by yourself.considering the only way i can see is when i specifically search for it you cant just type in dog in google and expect whitney wisconsin to show upalso just to add some stuff its not just dogs being used for sex since horses cats etc so why not haram every single animal if all of them are used for sex in the worldwide minority?gtSigh...The Prophet  said Cursed is he who curses his father cursed is he who curses his mother cursed is he who dedicates an animal sacrifice to other than Allaah cursed is he who meddles with the borders of someones land unjustly alters the landmark to encroach upon that land cursed is he who misleads a blind person away from his path cursed is he who has intercourse with an animal cursed is he who does the act of the people of Loot sodomy. Ahmad  AlArnaaoot said its Isnaad chain of narrators is Hasan goodgtThe Prophet  also said If someone engages in sexual intercourse with an animal kill him and kill the animal. Ahmad and others  AlArnaaoot said its Isnaad is HasangtFuck the animal and prepare to die.Not saying youre wrong but youre also a little rightthe st verse is also shown on the bible which is also right in the ethical perspectivebut the nd verse only makes it worst you cant kill a guy who is trying to satisfy his fetish not saying he is allowed to do it thou but i dont think people should break into his house while hes fking his cat just because of allahs namegtAbout sunat it is obviously more hygienic if you did that. The piss under the skin cant be easily washed off. And if its not fully clean from the filth your prayer is invalid. Thats why muslim wash their butt thoroughly after pooing and not simply using the tissue.First of all my prayer is invalid? Since when taking a bath is a prayer?ndly because soap and water dont exist even a sunatd penis still has the bacteria under the skin so your own argument is invalid itselfrdly we have lube and condomsgt Logically there should only be one god and if there are many gods who can create being the world should already be destroyed by now by the battle between gods. That one god can be called in many name in the past depends of how the language call a god. This is my theory aside from abrahamic religionislam christian and jew probably other religion like hinduoriginally believe in  god but it has many form buddhahe is a normal human who receive revelation hence probably one of the unmentioned prophet of the past told in quran the norseprobably not greek godZeus probably come from word Deus which means God and the people back then probably mix in some real ruler of the past and elevate them into the story of god or shintobelieve god essence in everything and existence of hitorigamisingle person god as deity of creation.. well the idea was somewhat there but vagueThe start of this video shows how a religion is made a religion is successful when it propagates effectively thats why the greek religion norse etc isnt well known nowalso nice theory from MOBAsgtThere was no prove that god isnt real its only a theory.This and thisdont tell me it only contradicts to the christian god every god that religion believes in also matches into the following criteria of god being  supernatural allknowing allpowerful allgoodgtlook at BigBang Theory how can a big bang happen if it was not created. Quran mentioned about Big Bang tooHave not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece then We parted them? And We have made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?Quran Surah Al Anbiya Welp the big bang theory is still an interesting theory but ill let you read this for yourselfgtSimpler religion can be anything like scientology or some other pagan religion that just worship stuffs.But however converting out of islam can land you in jail because laujeek. Also adding islamic studies in Form  sejarah only makes muslims so desperate for some attention imo v side note  Ffs topics about hang tuah or sergeant hassan are much more better than seeing the phrase all non islamic religions are all Arab jahilliahgtwhat do youe mean killing many innocent people? have people died in malaysia coz people in here wanted the syaria law?im talking about muslims worldwide most malaysian muslims are already the balls carrier of PAS or the government or wutever but sharia has already killed people in the middle east for the demand of jihad which is already going on rn vgtim at work cant open youtube.then open youcube,malaysia,dg7aeqr,1,t5_2qh8b

Negara islam yang PAS nak is no difference to TALIBAN. yelah nak pakai hukum hudud dan lain just like mini taliban where everything has to be separate between men adn women. Afganistan was a beautiful place the soviets got their boots on the ground Taliban chased them away and stayed too long that they turned the country upside down. Women were FORCED to wear the burka mate the face isnt even part of the aurat pun men were forced to grow and keep the beard rasulullah said nothing of forcing anyone to keep oneTaliban is the result when you let MUSLIM fundamentalists take over the country and PAS is made on fundies as they chased away anyone with a shred of moderation in their last party elections.Which fullyislamic country has a good multiracial policy? Let alone that a good human and women rights record? For starters KSA employs hudud... their woman and human rights records are abysmal. These things are spoken and written all over the net dont be a lameass and ask me for sources it is like asking please provide the source that the sun is a star Its a fact that KSA is a shit country to live in if you were not a Saudi Islam is beautiful but people like you the fundies are ruining it because you are a bunch of losers with nothing better to do than to control others by employing Islam as your shield and spear. You should be protecting Islam instead you are manipulating it. it is know la no need to hide it even a Muslim like myself hate your types and speciesBtw there are PLENTY of countries that do not adhere to islam nor any other religion as part of their constitution that are more Islamic by nature than all of the islamic countries put together. They dont need ISLAM to be good people... check out the scandavanian countries and how they treat Muslims that arrive in theirs... some bad but pretty good in general. They are more Islamic than most Muslims especially PAS fundies like your party members and you We dont need Muslims like you. We need Islam.
