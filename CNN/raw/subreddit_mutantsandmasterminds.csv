1354194,0,t3_29lb64,I would throw a ridiculous dodgeparry on him to emulate his enemies missing.I would also get as much of the luck points as you can get and a couple of the luck control powers.Precognition and mindreading can be used as I pick a random card but ruleswise you are reading their mind and taking the right card.As for damage it would be worth getting the reflectredirect power to emulate that folks attacking you tend to hit their allies instead this can be a very powerful power especially if you get it as a reaction power which would also allow you to sink a lot of points into it.I would also give them the advantage beginners luck hell give them everything with the word luck in it.EDIT huh only just realised that this thread wasnt asking for mechanics advice...,mutantsandmasterminds,cim1fa2,2,t5_2y199

5496223,0,t1_cwdoxqc,gtBut confused as this seems contrary. I thought you implied knighthood lumps together knight job skillsTo reiterate my comment Expertise knighthood includes all the ACADEMIC KNOWLEDGE necessary to be a knight so expertise chivalry is not necessary.Academic knowledge would be things like whose banner that is the correct fashion to great each level of nobility the chivalric code. It doesnt cover things like being able to ride a horse well athletics being able to spot things perception being able to look for things in a room investigation being able to convince people to do what you want persuasion.gtSo whats the problem with Force Field? I just copied green lanterns defenses then NERFED THEM ALL. its hard to believe it still stands out as OP with that in mind.The issue is that you arent PL  in a mixed PL game you are PL  in a PL  game. As such you have no use for an impervious defense on top of a  in toughness.Its like creating a st level DampD sorcerer amp wasting a spell slot on a spell that is a defense against Tarresques instead of spending the finite resource on something that will actually be useful in game right now. gtSo penetrating  does not penetrate a PL  character?It penetrates only impervious so its not actually helping you since the chances that your gm a first time gm for MampM is going to use impervious is . You just happen to have purchased it at a level that you wouldnt get full use out of without fighting a PL  monster with a toughness shift of . Chances that you will face such a creature given that the system doesnt natively go that high is gtAnd lastly it seems like youre saying the problem Is the character is OP in combat and UP in non combat so I dont really get why this is a huge no no You arent even OPed in combat at this point. Any slightly tricky opponent can defeat you in battle because youve skimped on skills amp your fighting has no finesse because youve skimped on advantages. What will you do if a stealthy character lures you in to a enclosed location? What if you need to convince someone to do something? What if you need to find something in a room? What if you need to spot something? What if you need to figure out if the villain is lying to you?gtWhat Im hearing from what your saying is  is max rank for powers and that kills the coolness of what green lantern can do with his powers for me.No the powers cap at the PL of your game for anything with a saving throw. What Im telling you is that you are going over board with the power levels of some of your powers. What you are trying to do is to create something with no proportional response. As people keep on telling you this is not DampD stop trying to play to win. MampM is not a Player versus GM game its a shared storytelling game. If you build power after power with no proportional response you remove the challenge of play amp the game stops being fun not just for you but for everyone else at the table too. And as soon as the GM realizes you are a one trick pony character heres how its going to play out.gtGM A shadow figure appears.gtYou I trap them in my impenetrable force bubble as I always do.gtGM The shadowy figure is trapped inside you force bubble..... The Shadowy figure runs their hands along the inside of the force bubble before nonchalantly stepping through its confines.Adventure after thatgtGM You have heard the televised riddle of the Magpie if you do not answer correctly  of  civilians in as of yet undisclosed locations will die.gtYou I dont know can I have a clue.gtGM Sure if youve got the requisite expertise skill or insightgtYou I have expertise KnighthoodgtGM Yeah thats not going to do it looks like you are going to have to wing it.gtYou Cant we just fight things I can immediately put inside my impenetrable force bubble?gtGM No.Thats how thats going to play out.gtBut now I am left with  power points. What should I use them on in your opinion?Skills and advantages. What skills and advantages do you really need to really play your concept? Because thats your answer.,mutantsandmasterminds,cwe70oe,1,t5_2y199

8245499,0,t1_d51h074,I think youre going the right direction.

8331065,0,t1_d5iwqzs,If you absolutely wanted Summon I would limit it to him and one heroic duplicate as thatll stick cost a good chunk of points and allow him to have two characters that are near PL with a handful of alternate powers to emphasize him using multiple lessstable duplications.Again though Im incredibly biased. Either way I hope you and your player are able to find a way to make it work best for the both of you! ,mutantsandmasterminds,d5ixsos,2,t5_2y199
8549533,0,t3_4wucqs,gtSo let me preface this by saying that the layout of this book is one of the worst Ive seen so theres a significant chance Im overlooking stuff. Im probably making obvious mistakes.LOL thats pretty much the first thing everyone notices. Its laid out well if you already know how to play not so much so during the initial learning phase.Ill see what I can do to help you out.gtToughness Whats the minimum viable Toughness at CP? You really want to aim to be close to the caps with MampM E.  or  points either side of the cap at PL  is fine but if you only have half the cap you are pretty much a walking red splotch in waiting.At PL  you really want to be within spitting distance of those caps.gt I started at Toughness  and took no powersAdvantages to boost it. By my math Get hit by a Rank  power roll Toughness vs DC .  succeeds  or lower instaIncapacitated by  degrees of failure? Yeah that sounds about right. Honestly I can never remember the numbers for it off the top of my head so I use the damage resistance matrix in the back of the Heroes Handbook. gtI got hit by a single ranged attack with a Dodge  rolled a  to resist damage and got wrecked. This feels like it shouldnt be possible but requiring superhuman Toughness at CP also seems asinine.Its not asinine there is also the Defensive Roll advantage which is toughness for people who arent invulnerable but are instead good at mitigating damage by rolling with the hit. You can also put more into defenses by trading off your toughness for your defenses. Im not sure if you are using the generic Heroes Handbook or the DC Adventures version but its near the start of chapter  Secret Origins.But generally yeah you are meant to be playing superheroes taking a hit or being able to roll with a hit is pretty much what you should be doing.gtDo Powers ever land? Yes quite often.gtWe cant get the DCs above  The DC for powers is based on ranks   for non damaging effects amp rank   for damage effects. So the save versus affliction  ranks would be DC  but for say a  rank Damage effect would be DC .gtwhile Close Combat and various Interaction skills via cheap Advantages like Fascinate and Taunt are rolling a  often opposed by the same defense as Powers.Yes interaction skills especially those followed up by an advantage like Fascinate are quite powerful but they also have severe limitations. For instance you cant use fascinate once combat has started. Another such limitation is that it possess two different defenses either a will save or an insight check. The second also being a skill it can also be  at PL  the caps for skills being PL  .gtDoes Strengthbased melee just do more damage than Powers? Powers do a max  damage at  CP but Strengthbased attacks can start higher than  and get additional bonuses like weapons maneuvers etc.Nope all damage is locked at the games PL. So no matter what the source of the damage be it straight strength a straight damage effect a damage effect in a device or a damage effect in equipment  it caps out at  for a PL  game. The only way to do more damage than the power cap is again through the trade offs or similar advantages which also trade off accuracy for damage or through a successful critical hit theres probably something else Ive missed but I cant think of it right now.gtRecovering from damage Theres no way to fully recover from Incapacitated right? Treatment fixes the Stunned condition leaving Dazed and Hindered I guess and a second Treatment fixes Dazed but theres no way to fix Defenseless Unaware and Hindered? Like is a combined condition a shorthand for the underlying conditions or is it functionally different from the underlying conditions such that curing any of the underlying removes the whole combined condition?If you check the section on recovery in Chapter  Action and Adventure this is covered. PCs recover over time for every minute of rest a PC recovers. First they recover their damage status from being incapacitated then staggered amp finally dazed.Once you have no more damage statuses to heal you move on to  Toughness check penalties healing  per minute until fully recovered.gtAffliction Power Lets say I take Controlling for the  degree effect and have Progressive. The target has  degrees of initial failure and then fails its resistance check at the end of its turn. Its now Controlled until it gets a minute of recovery and Im free to target someone else with the same power while controlling the target? This seems... insanely OP?It does seem insanely OP but the key word there is seems. Afflictions are actually quite under powered since its rare for a PC to fail quite that spectacularly under normal play conditions since they would have to roll a save so bad it was  degrees of failure below the save which would be  points below the save.Even with progressive if the player only fails a little rather than a lot it would still take  subsequent failures over  rounds to reach the level of controlled.When it does happen its usually quite spectacular but it doesnt happen often enough that you could rely on it to always turn the tide of battle.So while it appears OP amp it certainly can be if one really REALLY flubs a save its actually quite under powered in most cases of actual play.gtDo powers like Affliction require some sort of attack roll or are they just resisted by the targets Resistance Check? Both. First you roll to hit amp if successful then the player has a chance to roll to resist the effect DC  affliction rank  .gtWhat if you use the Increased Range modifier?Same deal just using the ranged skill to hit rather than the close skill to hit.I hope that answered your questions if anything is unclear or you need more help please dont hesitate to ask.,mutantsandmasterminds,d6a9i48,5,t5_2y199

8837886,0,t1_d7a6nat,Hmmmm the thing about play by post is that it can be quite time consuming. If you are busy at the moment you may consider looking up one of the many MampM actual play podcasts that exist on the web.That way you can scratch that MampM itch on the go.

9655922,0,t1_da39t0j,Is that a Create effect?If thats the case you have a limit to how much matter you can control in a single turn or at all in case you have some flaw that says so. Multiple turns creatingmanipulating matter however do allow you to cumulatively make massive structures of your descriptor.And also doesnt matter the shape per the rules you only create a single object in a round so even if you make a mazelike structure all the walls have to be bound together by some fashion and if destroyed all crumble at once unless you apply the Split modifier to it to create multiple weaker objects.That said yes you should be able to do that creating obstacles and cover is possibly the greatest tool in the Create effects box as long as you respect volume limits.Do keep in mind that at any time your enemyies couldve just attacked the wall which has a Toughness equal to your effects rank which is not that hard to destroy but yes it does guarantee that he loses a turn which can be huge.Another thing to keep in mind is that if your Create power is in an Array once you switch to another power your created stuff will cease to be unless you bought the Continuous andor Permanent extras which make this power quite pricy and thus fair to be strong.Either way in your mentioned scenario you were not OP the match up was just very skewed in your favor and you were clever a being that can create cover and obstacles at will vs a being that can only attack meleerange guess whos gonna win more often than not?,mutantsandmasterminds,da3akvl,3,t5_2y199

11390409,0,t3_62jfwt,So the nitty gritty is this someone hits you with am effect the effect in this case is damage. The target of the effect makes a toughness save vs the strength of the effect  . So for instance if someone has a damage effect rank of  the toughness save to avoid damage from the effect would be .If the target of the effect makes the toughness save they dont take damage. If they fail they get an injury. And depending on how badly they failed it may be worse if you fail by too much then you may be knocked out instantly.For each injury you receive you suffer a  penalty to your toughness saves. So the more injured you get the easier it is to knock you out.I dont have the book in front of me. But that is the basics.,mutantsandmasterminds,dfn317t,4,t5_2y199
