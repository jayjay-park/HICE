3274728,0,t1_cp1hqdj,Man I dont even know what Im going to do if I try to go for it. Im still petrified after hitting the wall twice at invitationals. I mean it was just embarrassing. This is my first year with sci oly our entire teams second year and we had a very crappy scrambler last year. I made huge improvements on it this year but invitationals in January went terribly. Im not sure if it was our measuring or what but both times we had accounted for it to stop about a meter short of the wall and it still slammed into it full speed. I guess all I can do is figure out how to curve it and get it to go faster. The can is always placed in the same place in regard to the start line right? ,scioly,cp1jnxm,1,t5_2ukeb

8388527,0,t1_d5pvl2h,Thanks for the advice. I forgot to mention that our team already goes to three invitationals during the year. Last year however we only medaled twice per invite and in different events every time. Do you have any tips for how we can learn better from the invitationals?,scioly,d5q43gi,1,t5_2ukeb

11141512,0,t1_deuuxn4,We were in the second section and they told us if we needed scissors we could go up and use their only pair. And tbh I still dont know if stripping the wires was necessary...we wasted a lot of time doing it and still didnt get very good results  Im pretty sure it was just following the rubric that was so important ,scioly,deuvnqt,1,t5_2ukeb
