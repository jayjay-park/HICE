143652,0,t3_1vqdig,I suggested this in another threadMoMeyersWrightRobinson for ChandlerUdrihKMart.Knicks want to rebuild.  MeyersRobinson will help that.  Mo will opt out giving them some cash.Chandler provides Blazers nd Unit with defense.  KMart can hit a consistent midrange shotplus add a big body.  Udrih can share ballhandling duties with McCollum.  Claver will shoot s alongside McCollum.This nd unit is designed to act as linemen of sorts.  They slow down the tempo ensuring that the other teams nd unit will score less points.  This makes it harder to outscore Portland in the long run.  And once the starters come back in the Portland offense will pick up again meaning more points per volume.Ideally it makes the Blazers unstoppable.,ripcity,ceusjta,-2,t5_2rt2i

578522,0,t3_20reah,Hard to say. I mean many of the issues we are having result from a lack of nd half adjustments which the coaching staff is primarily responsible for. I dont know if firing Stotts would make the team any better next year. Theyd be better off searching for a proven assistant with a defensive mindset.Still his endofgame offense is really uninspiring and frankly everyone knows what plays hes going to run and he still insists on running them. At some point you have to be creative and throw different wrinkles in there. Maybe he is and the guys just arent executing them who knows. If the blazers end up missing the playoffs cant believe Im writing that then there will definitely be some personnel changes I just doubt that Stotts would be one of them. ,ripcity,cg61678,3,t5_2rt2i

647651,0,t3_21f8h5,Injuries and fatigue dont help but its more than that. LMA is pretty inefficient from the low post. Teams figured this out and stopped double teaming him so we couldnt get so many open threes. LMAs scoring average is up but his FG is down quite a bit. We havent adjusted well to other teams figuring us out and the recent injury issues havent helped.Our bench isnt great but Stotts hasnt given anyone on the bench consistent PT outside of Williams. Young guys arent going to get better if they dont play. I know there isnt a ton of talent or depth on the bench but you cant continue to run the starters into the ground.Raise your hand if you would rather have Spencer Hawes right now over Allen Crabbe. The cost of both players was more or less  second round picks. If we had Hawes there is no doubt in my mind we would be in the top  in the conference at the end of the season. Its smaller less glamorous deals like this that can really screw a team and Neil Olshey hasnt done much in my eyes as of yet.,ripcity,cgdvzfm,1,t5_2rt2i

Honestly it just feels like its going to be a matter of everyone having a good contribution and one guy stepping up and having a great game. We lost in Houston because LA had a terrible game and the loss at home was mostly getting outplayed but Wes was also pretty much a non factor with a few hustle plays but no real offensive contribution and allowing Harden his best game of the series by far.

975171,1,t3_259pa7,Spurs fan  here  I will be honest I expected this series to be a lot closer.  I dont think you guys have a talent problem I just dont think Terry Stotts coaching style can keep up with Gregg Popovichs.  I hope I dont sound like an arrogant douche but thats what Im seeing because as far as pure talent  theres no way we should be beating you guys.    Im not saying FIRE STOTTS but I think hes going to have to completely retool his coaching methods.  Portland should be the bad boys on defense they need to watch film on the Detroit Pistons circa ish as they kind of have the same personnel they just need to find a defensive specialist like Ben Wallace.  Once that happens  good luck to the rest of the NBA.,ripcity,chf4woq,4,t5_2rt2i
981881,1,t3_25cnle,Sadly I think our fantastic season ends here folks.... Our biggest positives this year would probably be the solidification of Damian as a legitimate top point guard in the league save for his defensive capabilities which obviously needs tons of work the massive disparity in wins last year vs this year that no one really saw coming and the fact that we won our first series in  years regardless of how we exit the second round.Biggest problems I think everyone can agree on is our defensive intensity pressure and sets. And the near nonexistent bench presence. If we can shore up both those aspects of our game come next season then we are going to be quite a formidable team,ripcity,chfwc30,4,t5_2rt2i

1173032,0,t1_ci1kmbi,gt if we had a player who was skilled at running and offense and getting other players involvedHes not Rondo but hes not particularly bad at this. He has pretty much identical assist numbers per minute and usage rates as the other available PGs Collison Hinrich Ridnour Blake.gt instead of dribbling around and taking bad shots.Like I said I think a lot of it has to do with putting him in a situation where he was bound to not succeed. Look at Monta Ellis in MIL. He was forced to be the number one option and he turned into an inefficient chucker. But before then when he played second fiddle to BDiddy and now with Dirk by his side hes putting up great numbers. The same has been true of Mo.

If youre looking for more info on the NBA as a whole just hang out in that subreddit for a while its really active and has a ton of great people posting and commenting a really great place to learn.Good choice picking the Blazers as a team if only for the fact that theyre one of the most fun teams to watch the last couple years right up there with Golden State and the Clippers. Theyve got a beautiful offense with a ton of ball movement a lot of s and two of the best players in the game in Damian Lillard and LaMarcus Aldridge.Might be a little difficult finding ways to watch the games from Virginia but you can subscribe to rnbastreams and people will post them. Or you can join us in the game threads on rnba and find the streams there not to mention its a lot more fun chatting about the games and bitching about the refs together in there.Have fun and enjoy the season!,ripcity,cmf35m4,1,t5_2rt2i

Hes got a real set of balls on him and is willing to take it to the hole no matter whats in his way and he seems like hes succeeding more than his body type would expect.Overall I dont know how well hed do in the NBA I would have thought late nd round based on his current play  he isnt even a starter for Gonzaga right now but hes on a crowded team.

3743969,0,t3_33achz,I partially agree. People are piling on Lillard a lot over the past few days which unfortunately has been simmering the past few months. I see it more on rnba than here though. I come here to talk about the Blazers with the other people who watch them the most because most of rnba is actually just high schoolers who play fantasy basketball and k and base all of their basketball knowledge off of those. They dont know anything about the Blazers even if they think they do so their opinions are useless.However I dont come here at all for sunshine and lollipops and Adam Bjaranson eternal blind optimism. There are serious issues here that go beyond this series or Damians shooting slump or whether Afflalo can play in Game . This subreddit is at its most interesting when people are sharing critical competing viewpoints and right now were getting confronted with what might be a critical juncture for the franchise. We cant pretend like its not happening.It doesnt do anyone any good to go everything is fine LaMarcus is going to be back our team is just a little hurt Jason Quick is a fucking tool and is making shit up the Blazers are awesome. Being a fan isnt about living in denial its about understanding your team and considering everything positive and negative thats happening with them. The wagon circling is getting just as if not more obnoxious as the supposed negativity because theres a lot to be learned from selfreflection. If were being transparent about things Im more of a pessimist about the near future than I was before but I never try to be negative for the sake of catharsis or simple kvetching. I just am seeing a lot of stuff that doesnt bode well and no its not because we just lost Game . ,ripcity,cqj1cua,19,t5_2rt2i

4457719,0,t3_3c4kho,Posted as a response to someone else but here it is hereTotal stunt. If any of it is true the first spin or the second quote about LMA getting carried away... both make LMA look even more dumb to me. Hes a grown man he can sign where he wants is valid but so then is hes a grown man he can say what he means and not what a GM tells him to. If I assume any of this article is right it can be spun either way to make NO look shit or LMA look shit. But it still screams to me LMA is a bonehead.On the one hand if Olshey knows LMA isnt coming back hed probably tell LMA to stfu about it so that the fans dont crucify him every bad game or the whole playoffs for not being focused or for being out the door already. Which is fair. As I saw it it seemed like LMA checked out in March and thats with his comments. Hey dont tel anyone you want out or theyll offer you less money. Other teams will think youre not a team player...It would all be PR stuff and in no way benefits Olshey. If LMA announces early NO can get something back for him or plan around the departure. If LMA waits... nothing changes if NO still knows and tells him to say he isnt leaving. NO still knows. So the team still nets the same results either way. But and this is the reason it seems completely fabricated NO did nothing and this is a dude weve seen make some ballerass moves thus far. NO did nothing and so I assume still LMA was yanking chains until his last day. Also LMAs camp already said they just let POR know last night that he was gone not a year ago as they reportedly say in this article.Screams PR bullshit to slam Olshey. Whether it is or not LMA needs to seriously grow a pair.,ripcity,csskrmd,4,t5_2rt2i

Whereas making the playoffs guarantees your team a cumulative  minutes of playoff experience.  games  minutes  players at a time.

We pick up a nice asset such as a rookie or use it to trade for a semistar at a position of need. Let me make this clear PICKS ARE THE MOST VALUABLE ASSETS IN ALL OF BASKETBALL.ROOKIE CONTRACTS ARE THE BEST VALUE PERIOD.So under that situation we keep the pick and use it to improve the team. This summer we sign another player or two with the M or so we have and we improve significantly while keeping the vast majority of our current team intact.Then next year we have a better team and end up in the thth seed and the pick we owe DEN ends up being the nd pick in the draft.Situation B We end up with  wins and grab the th or th seed and lose in the first round to GSW or SAS. We lose the pick which ends up being the th pick and we clearly are a middling team in need of more assets in the form of good players. But now we have one less asset the pick and were not so much better with  wins than  wins as is applies to getting a star that would have signed here regardless of a playoff series.TLDRMiss playoffs get th pick forfeit nd pick in  gtgtgt Make playoffs and lose in first round forfeit th pick this year get nd pick in ,ripcity,czxykit,6,t5_2rt2i

7384793,0,t3_4ghfbw,I said this in the game thread on rnba and Ill say it again but with more detailI dont think NO flips a max deal at Whiteside this offseason. Its not the kind of value deal hes done so well with so far and I think Whitesides ego might rub the wrong way with our established team chemistry and Dames leadership. Plus our biggest problem in our frontcourt right now is spacing and offensive production. Whiteside brings more of the same to our lineup as we already have in Plumlee and Davis  guys who live and breathe in the paint whose main contributions are more defensive than offensive. Outside of  feet they struggle. Who would we play him with? What would that mean for PlumleeDavis?Also theres issues with our offensive style. I can almost count on my fingers and toes the number of CAREER assists that Whiteside has. If we throw him the ball on the block what happens if he doesnt pass out of it? This could kill our flow offense that gives DameCJCrabbeAminu so many open looks. LaMarcus wasnt a STELLAR passer but he was far more gifted offensively and had much wider range than Whiteside.We do need rim protection and Whiteside would certainly offer that but I think we could pick someone else up on a better deal who could check more boxes for us.,ripcity,d2hlmvz,7,t5_2rt2i

NBA teams are really smart and I think there have been some interesting defensive schemestactics that have slowed down Curry in particular these playoffs that teams league wide will adopt more. The Warriors arent demigods or anything. They play a small lineup and their offense has been proven to be largely neutralized when they are out rebounded the extra fgas compensate for GSs pt advantage.

Relying on the photo as evidence of Disneys wishes in  both parties signed a formal agreement granting the university the right to use Donalds likeness as a symbol for and restricted to Oregon sports.

If he actually put time and dedication into his craft he could be a much better player than he is. Imagine if people had to actually respect his dribble drive. Imagine if he got big both in terms of physique and mentality on defense and started locking people down instead of slacking when the going got rough on his matchup. You can see where the potential is but I dont think hes gonna get there till he fixes his mindset because right now he is just soft and weak minded.

10214727,0,t3_5m9s3l,Kevin OConnor With Damian Lillard sidelined the Blazers lost  to the Warriors on Wednesday but the effort by C.J. McCollum was a highlight of the night. McCollum was ferocious scoring in the first half and for the game scored  points to go with nine rebounds and five assists.Its the little things like this that make McCollum who he is First he crosses over to blow by Kevin Durant. But because Durants pterodactyl arms make him a threat to block the shot from behind McCollum slows his drive. This keeps Durant on his back allowing McCollum to stretch for a clean layup.McCollum later hoodwinks Stephen Curry too. Currys defense might look bad here but you cant blame him for looking to contest the shot McCollum is shooting . percent on pullup s this season per SportVU. McCollum attempted a careerhigh  shots with a . usage percentage on the night and it wasnt until the Warriors started more aggressively defending him that he was neutralized. The increased defensive attention put a damper on McCollums performance in the second half but thats whatll tend to happen when hes not playing with his dynamic backcourt partner.The real story here isnt the game itself but that it offered a glimpse into a world where McCollum is the man. McCollum has played  games without Lillard and in those games hes averaging . points . assists and . rebounds on a . effective field goal percentage via StatMuse.com. To put those numbers into perspective only  players all time have ever posted averages of  points five assists and four rebounds in a season via BasketballReferenceand only five of them have done so with an effective field goal percentage of  or higher Michael Jordan Larry Bird LeBron James Durant and Curry. McCollum wasnt at his most efficient on Wednesday against the Dubs but his overall performance with Lillard out has been tremendous.Even with Lillard suited up this season McCollum has put up big numbers points . assists and . rebounds per gamebut the difference is significant enough to make you wonder just what he is truly capable of if he were in a role that featured him as the no.  scorer and playmaker.,ripcity,dc1wazp,3,t5_2rt2i

We are in year two of a rebuild and Lillard and McCollum are locked up long term. And the new CBA makes it even easier to keep them into the next contract.

Olshey has publicly stated his desire to keep the team together both from the perspective of seeing natural growth and for keeping assets in play for future deals. No sense in letting guys walk. We may not have paid as much for a guy like Turner but we definitely needed a third ball handler to go with Dame amp CJ and there werent many needlemovers on the market.I think its worst from a fan perspective because a lot of people took last years success for granted and are starting to turn on the team.

11551528,0,t1_dg5cjkx,Man youre obviously a Warriorsgeneral bandwagon fan and the fact that you still think Ed Davis is playing for us shows you havent watched the Blazers at all this season.I mean come on. Zaza? Nurkic is so much better than Zaza its laughable. David West is washed up. Also yes Curry Klay and KD well maybe KD wont be able to punish Vonleh. Of course sometimes theyll score because theyre obviously extremely talented but hes actually just fantastic out there. Guards think they can beat him off the dribble all the time and then just fail and settle for a  over his huge ass wingspan. I dont know that youve watched Vonleh the past  months if you dont think hes incredible at switching onto guards. Point being hes not going to be abused by any means. I trust Vonleh more in an ISO against curry than almost any guard on our teamNurkic is reasonably capable at guarding smalls. He hasnt had to do it much but Im not worried. With how Green is shooting this year you can just leave him for a second to let your guard recover on Curry anyway.Do I think were going to win? Absolutely not. Do I think our frontcourt   if Nurkic is healthy  has the advantage? Definitely.,ripcity,dg5dajk,4,t5_2rt2i

11776245,0,t1_dgumpfl,gt Why would they trade Paul George for a much worse  in Allen Crabbe who makes virtually identical money?Crabbes guaranteed for  more years while PG is guaranteed to walk for nothing after a year. gtIf Indiana were to move PG what benefit can Portland offer than other teams cant?Three draft picks.gtThe answer is youth high value contracts AminuVonleh and salary flexibility Ezeli.Salary flexibility is worth way more to contending teams than it is to rebuilding teams with George gone Indianas going to have more money then they can spend on free agents since nobodys going to want to play there until they put together a competitive roster. A talented player like Crabbe on a longterm deal who could potentially be the starting SG on a team trying to climb back out of the lottery in  or  is attractive. Especially compared to Vonleh whos on a short contract and due for a payday before theyll have put anything back together. But obviously the main value wed be giving them would be the draft picks. Nobody else has three picks this year and while other teams have more valuable picks theyre all bad teams for the most part who would be taking a big risk with a Paul George rental because they couldnt turn their franchise around quickly enough to keep him next summer. Obvious exception is Boston who can beat any offer we could barring us putting CJ on the table or something and would have a good shot of keeping George next year. ,ripcity,dguvgy0,3,t5_2rt2i
