5289151,0,t1_cvnlnev,Never let the masses silence you!!  Your voice must be HEARD man!  Haha.  People worry too much about Karma here its strange.  My only issue with T rewards on story missions is that story missions generally drop the best gear both guaranteed and possible.  You can get tier  stuff from the requisition crane sector battles award you something insane like  pulls or something.  I dont wear a set at my personal endgame  I have all  gear and just got my  rifle but I have Guerrilla Trooper and Enforcer gear on my character.  Youre completely right at this point I have no incentive to change my gear around really.  I mean I could swap out my enforcer gear since I dont use swords but I just dont care enough.I believe the downvotes have to do with your attitude not your opinion youre taking things too seriously like I said above.

5393612,0,t1_cw127xd,I got Alrrark from an Opportunity mission I believe so Im not sure if hes unique.  Though I guess I dont fully understand unique now that I think about it.  If Tryken is the only storydriven crew member then once you have a certain unique crew from any source that particular crew is no longer on the loot table for crew?  At least until retired?  Since unique crew are technically immune to death anyway if Alrrark was only immune to death but he was unique that would kind of defeat the whole purpose wouldnt it?So Alrrark should be Unique immune to everything. Nonunique only immune to death. Or nonunique immune to everything.Not sure which is correct.EDIT  Just found where the Unique flag is and Alrrark is unique looks like anyone with abilities that I can see so far is unique.  So I hope hes actually immune to capture as well otherwise thats a pretty useless second ability.,StarWarsUprising,cw13eav,1,t5_390ha

5490108,0,t3_3q1f7e,I read the thread on the Kabam site a couple hours before the event started and I was very tempted to comment to all of the people who were whining about how unofficial the whole thing was.  As far as I was concerned I just appreciated having any kind of goal since the grind can become monotonous after level .  Im not going to complain about how they implement a freebie in a game I dont pay for.  I see now that the complainers were right.      Im OK with a casual event and Im OK with changes but you cannot announce in multiple places that I can gain credits by any means possible and then change those rules in the same casual manner while the event is actually already running.      The one investment I do make in the game is my time.  I wound up selling gear that I normally would have salvaged.  I invested time to collect the gear and already knew the rewards werent worth cashing it in but I have a lot of crew that I need credits to upgrade and decided to make the sacrifice.  I expect Kabam to honor the original milestones.    Im not saying that people who dont pay to play the game dont have the right to complain.  I believe they are still a comodity for Kabam.  Without the numbers that the FP players bring I dont think the people who are dropping butt loads of  on each SB would be as compelled to spend so much.,StarWarsUprising,cwdeup2,1,t5_390ha

5615206,0,t1_cwszxda,Ahh thanks for the link Lwobtsud. I guess I wont be using Bluestacks to stream anymore. And yes they need to revisit that policy. If anything streaming the game like I am doing helps promote their game and so does making videos on YouTube about it. I understand some players will take the emulator to a new measure but its only to make the game better. Thats what we all want. Point is people are going to use emulators because its easier than using your phone and it kills the battery on some phones much worse than others. Its not our job as players to regulate their product. Im sure there are many people using emulators now especially hardcore players. Its simply more efficient. But at the same time I do understand their concerns with emulators giving advantages. I guess we will have to wait for them to understand these concerns.,StarWarsUprising,cwt4cl9,1,t5_390ha
