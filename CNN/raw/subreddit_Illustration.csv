305593,0,t3_1xljqo,Not hyperRealistic I am afraid. This is what hyper realism is. In the sense yours is realistic as in it is a realistic depiction of a subject. However in conjunction with the background it starts to lack realism. This is also evident in the top lefthand corner where part of the hair has a chunk taken out of it. This normally happens when the reference images background was incorrectly removed or was painted over a reference image that had the background incorrectly removed. That said keep going and painting. Each one gets better than the last. ,Illustration,cfcfx52,5,t5_2qh79

If not you should definitely check him out his content is somewhat similar.So my two cents sorry I feel a little weird critiquing you on reddit lol is just to minimize the texture in the background a lot like sachins work and if you dont want it to feel as digital adding noise with low flow and opacity to a flat color can soften the boldness of digital color. Right now the texture you have is pretty soft but I still felt my attention being taken from the focal point in a way that wasnt intended.Also I actually think it would be really good to darken the inside of the person more while keeping the soft blue glow in the center to direct your attention more to whats happening in her head.Hope you dont mind the crit.

1013095,0,t1_chjbemm,I think to compare apples to apples you would have to compare Illustrator and Painter.  A more fair comparison to Photoshop would be Gimp.To be honest Ive used Photoshop and Illustrator Illustrator very little before but Im not as comfortable nor as proficient with either as compared to the software I listed above.All I can say is that I much preferred the feel of Corel Painter  compared to Illustrator.  The tools and brushes felt more tactile and responsive and true to their reallife counterparts.  I prefer Painters GUI and layout as it is highly customizable.  I use a custom dashboard in Painter that initially took me several hours to setup just how I liked it.  The ability to create custom brushes tools patterns etc. in Painter  is also very easy and extremely powerful.  Once you have a solid grasp on it your creative palette becomes a lot bigger.Im not sure if Illustrator has this same capability but Corel Painter  also has very impressive stylus tracking and sensitivity.  Look at this to see what I mean.As I said I have very little experience with Illustrator so its difficult to compare the two.  ,Illustration,chjg2cz,1,t5_2qh79

Who inspired you to take interest in this type of illustration?When I was uni one of my drawing instructors would harp on me for my angular style and semicheating. I would sketch out ideas by measuring every point or angle to calculate where it would be relative to my artboard. Her reasoning was that I wasnt learning to draw so much as copy. So with time and practice I ditched the rulers. This is why my personal drawing style still involves angles and basic shading.,Illustration,co6brom,1,t5_2qh79

5003811,0,t3_3jgi1v,My trouble when I first got my tablet was creating Smooth lines without my hands creating too much jitter.  I tweaked the pen sensitivity and adjusted my grip over time.  Sometimes Ill just draw a curve using bezels which I could easily do with my mouse.I expect you will encounter some difficulty with this sort of thing by having the tablet pen strapped to your hands. I dont know how much control you will have over the anglepressure of the tablet pen but these settings can all be tweaked in the software you will be using.I rarely use my shortcut buttons I use photoshop so I access the shortcuts via the keyboard.I have a cheap Wacom tablet with shortcut buttons both on the tablet itself and the pen.  Ive used the Wacom Intuos  with the screen which was nice but  I preferred the  pen for various reasons pen sensitivity being one of them.  I love the big tablet screen I find it similar to drawing with traditional media as far as working with my hands goes but with the luxury of digital media varying save points undo copy and paste etc.. Since I dont have the money to keep a big screen tablet at home I bought a little plug in one and got used to working on it while looking up at the monitor.  That was not hard to get used to I think.There are bigger nicer ones out there that are easier to work with but a big tablet with screen is damn expensive and still may not meet your needs.  If youre going to get a tablet I would consider getting an inexpensive one without touch sensitivity one that only reacts to the pen not your skin contact at least to start with so you can toy with the features and see if it works for you.I already owned photoshop and illustrator which I learned on so thats what I am comfortable with.  I would say manga studio is a cheaper software option and has lots of great features but I wasnt nuts about it.Speaking of Vector illustrator versus Raster photoshop graphics...I dont know the limitations of your disability but maybe vector artwork would be good to explore?  I think the easiest breakdown would be to say that using Illustrator or other vector based software is like using paper cutouts to make shapes where Photoshop is more like painting or blending colors layering textures etc.  This is a gross oversimplification but Im thinking that if you can click and drag a mouse you could create and tweak as needed sophisticated curves in a vector software.Also I think my biggest suggestion of all would be just to draw anyway and often whether or not you get a tablet.  Pencil and sketchbook will give you a good and cheap chance to figure out how you see things and let you work out how to put those things down on paper.Im also interested in what your goal are here.  Is it drawing you want to be good at that is making D pictures or are you just interested in digital media?  Any interest in learning D softwareimage creation?I have tons of resources I can share with you to get started but Im on my phone.

The proportions are off the strawberries and text seem like afterthoughts and the huge gold earrings are just a super weird color choice. The size of the earrings actually further accentuates the smallness of the head.,Illustration,d7nrpie,1,t5_2qh79

9915517,0,t3_5h5zp8,our public library sells books when they are sitting in the shelf for too long. I got his book A question of detail for  cents. Not knowing about him before this was a very special find for me and my kids and me love to look at it every now and then. It is very interesting to let the smaller ones point out what even is wrong in the pictures. Sometimes it is harder for them than you would think.

But you should definitely look into what avenues are available to sell prints of your stuff. Surely some folks here have bettermore specific advice for you than I do.,Illustration,db79o5s,1,t5_2qh79
