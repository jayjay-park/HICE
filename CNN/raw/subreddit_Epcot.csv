Ellens energy adventure is a ride I like but mostly for nostalgic reasons and can honestly be skipped. I would just check out wait times. If it looks good check it out. If its a long wait and youre not sure about the ride move on to the next and check back later. As for lunch. Youre going during food and wine. Thats lunch right there. Dont bother with the stuff that is there most of the year enjoy the options and check out something new.! Lastly yes go to Boardwalk. Its a great place to either keep the energy going and hit up a bar or restaurant. Or a great place to unwind and stroll the boardwalk grab a beer or snack try your luck at a Boardwalk game or check out the entertainment offered nightly. Its an amazing place. Have fun!!  Ill be there in October as well and cant wait. Enjoy your vacation,Epcot,cqs6aq5,7,t5_2t6xl

10303960,0,t3_5njv2i,Listen heres the thing okay? Let me tell you because I get asked about this a lot. They ask me all the time its in the papers blogs Buzzfeedwhatever that is. And they ask me they say Donald whats your policy on Arendelle? Listen I dont know Queen Elsa. I mean I know Queen Elsa but I dont know Queen Elsa okay? This is not my best friend. Maybe a good looker I dont know. This is what they tell me. Eight out of ten? I dont know.But I will say this okay? We had a major troll problem in Norway folks. Trolls and magic eyes and I think I even saw a polar bear there once. And now that Arendelle moves in yknow not so many problems. I mean they still have trolls thats true but theyre smaller and they dont mess with your boat. Or are they gnomes? Im going to get in trouble with the politically correct on that one oh boy. Queen Elsa convinced the trolls to leave the trade routes alone. And now Arendelles winning again. Norway didnt win just like we dont win anymore too. So I think yeah maybe we should be friends with them. I mean its like let it go already!,Epcot,dcc0ca7,7,t5_2t6xl
