1847376,0,t3_23wwkq,it was confirmed that they were asked to remix the track but they ABSOLUTELY hated the original track but decided to mess with them so they literally destroyed it and sent the track back.,autechre,ckbsyu5,2,t5_2w6c1
3460684,0,t1_cpmpuwe,Wow thats really interesting... It doesnt sound happy to me at all! If you contrast it with the melody from Pir which sounds blissful to me but still not overtly happy if not only because of the brutal destruction of the rhythm I think the differences are clear. Probably the most happy to me would be Slip from Amber. ,autechre,cpmqrzi,1,t5_2w6c1
4163250,0,t3_38e05k,gtEveryone pretty much unanimously thought it was the worst track on the record...If you were active on watmm.com during the release of Levent youd have found that users were more or less split down the middle on this one. Actually I think newfall was on average the one that was mentioned the least as far as favs are concerned. The other  were mentioned more or less equally as favs.Personally it was love at first sound for me.,autechre,crutj1d,1,t5_2w6c1

7677638,0,t3_4kh68c,Okay I actually wanted to ask some others what they thought of this one. I love the melody. Its so very simple what is it like three chords? yet it sounds so creepy and it is amazing how the notes just blend into each other. And I love all of the sound effects going on. They add to the atmosphere really well. Honestly the sound is just expertly crafted. Great ambient track.But heres the thing. Im not sure I can stand that it goes on for twenty minutes. As far as I can tell theres not really any evolution throughout the track right? It just keeps on repeating and repeating and I think it gets tedious after a while. Even though I like how it goes I dont think that it excuses its length. I wouldnt want any other Autechre track I love to extend unnecessarily. So I really want to hear the thoughts of OP and others who love this song on this issue. Can you justify the length? Do you think it should be this long?,autechre,d3ewheo,8,t5_2w6c1

8055315,0,t1_d4l7qys,Not sure what you mean by KS strings.  But almost every sound in known is definitely being pitchmodulated in some way or other.  Either slight programmed pitch modulations via an LFO or an evelope or some such or maybe doubled and detuned in some way or something else.  But the pitches are changing all over the place  not the underlying pitches you hear as the roots perhaps but the actual pitches in very small degrees.  Its part of what makes that track so unnerving.As to what I mean by filtering Im just referring to using filters to alter highly tonal sounds.  This is as good a definition as anyWhen you listen to corc you hear almost every note of the main melodic device being filtered differently and dynamically i.e. with some sort of envelope or LFO every time a note sounds.  Thats what put this track over the edge for me emotionally.  Theres a shape to the frequencies of each of the notes that can really only be achieved through electronics at least what they did in specific.Hope that clears it up.edit  just realized that there are two main melodic devices right from the start one high one low then a third comes in later.  Both have their own filtering which makes this aspect of the track extra rich for me.  There is some repetition in the filtering as well but that also anchors the track nicely for me.,autechre,d4lhrxd,1,t5_2w6c1

8214190,0,t3_4qaekp,I spent years not being that into them almost entirely based on the fact that people kept telling me Tri Repetae was their best album which after years of Aphex felt a bit basic on the whole. My mind was changed when I dived into Confield.I think the EP collection is actually the best introduction as it contains a little bit of everything.,autechre,d54btvg,1,t5_2w6c1

10303146,0,t1_dcbvhcn,but really any song from These Hopeful Machines counts.  It is perhaps the most overwrought pop album ever made.  I think its pretty great.  But it is ridiculous.probably one of his best known songs its sort of infamous for containing over  vocal edits which got it in the Guinness book. fun tune but lol,autechre,dcbx0qc,1,t5_2w6c1

I came to believe that AE is a sort of science and engineering group for audio and music related. Interestingly  science changes as more of our nature is discovered so does Autechre. They evolve and i embrace it.  ,autechre,ddhavkw,7,t5_2w6c1
