You will know that its never been dropped and that the structural integrity of it is good enough pass DOT standards.As for other gear I mainly buy used. Just recently have I bought my first set of new gear. But it was  and didnt include pants. You can look at the gear and see if its sound. Mainly look at the stitching on stress points to see if its falling apart or fraying.Hope this helps!,BikeGear,cfeyqh7,1,t5_2zy2r
