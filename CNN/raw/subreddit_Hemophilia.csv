8494658,0,t3_4w21gg,Sorry to hear that about your brother. I dont know much about his work environment but has he been upfront with his work about his hemophilia? He doesnt have to tell his manager but perhaps HR needs to be informed and educated. If thats to no avail perhaps check your states labour laws. If he has a hemophilia treatment Center get in touch with them for advice too. Best of luck. ,Hemophilia,d63ds42,2,t5_2tfhb

In my experience in the US clinical trials usually help to defray travel costs for study participants.Theres also an EU website that lists clinical trials.,Hemophilia,dg4rjxo,2,t5_2tfhb
