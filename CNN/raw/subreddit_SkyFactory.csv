8202038,0,t3_4rl4pm,Weird. I dunno. More info perhaps?. Are you sure youre using the Chisel  chisel?. Are you in single player or on multiplayer?. Do you have any nonSkyfactory optional mods installed that might cause Chisel  incompatibility especially if they arent enabled properly?. If youre on multiplayer and you have a friend who IS able to use the chisel I would suggest copying their mods and configs folders and replacing your own just to be sure everything is copacetic.        I dunno. Other than that I dont know of any reason why it would be behaving this way other than your computers haunted.,SkyFactory,d52t48r,1,t5_33k9s

8318546,0,t3_4tg75a,I have a chest fed via transfer pipes with cobblestone under that a hopper. The hopper feeds the autohammer. Under the ah I have another hopper feeding the autosieve. Under the autosieve another hopper into a chest. I am planning on feeding the chest to an auto crafter tier  to convert the various broken ores to blocks.See comment below that tries to help,SkyFactory,d5hdhka,2,t5_33k9s
8817576,0,t3_50w8y0,Get a mob farm going and a chunk loader. You should be able to look quite a bit of loot bags. Speed it up a bit. Shouldnt take too long to get it. ,SkyFactory,d77r411,1,t5_33k9s

10634751,0,t3_5s68f4,Nice video! One suggestion I have is to use the Ore Excavation mod to mine several blocks at once instead of mining them individually. This mod is a lighter vein miner and can be activated with the  key. If you do use it make sure you dont mine your platform! ,SkyFactory,ddcw6a4,1,t5_33k9s
10854564,0,t3_5v61nx,You cant. A mod called mobgrindingutils added a mob fan though and vector plates from dark utilities can also be used to move mobs mobs can also spawn on them. Hope I helped if youre trying to make a mob farm.,SkyFactory,ddzkkyp,3,t5_33k9s

10998716,0,t1_deegddg,Place signs below the level of the spawner and have a lava dispenser or a couple in the ceiling. When the whole level of the spawners is covered in lava its too bright for blaze spawns. Vanilla mechanics baby! ,SkyFactory,deeo670,2,t5_33k9s

11228372,0,t1_df4l982,Yep usually to the side of the edge levity blocks where they fall out and die. I picked up a lot of ink while building this.Also on the lag front this thing isnt anywhere near as bad as the fields of inferium essence or the turbines Ive got in other places. It was pretty laggy while placing the levity as it flowed up to the ceiling but was fine once id finished.,SkyFactory,df4pyz5,2,t5_33k9s
11360268,0,t1_dfjlji7,Hm not really unfortunately. Making sure the macbook is up to date naturally. It could just be that the video chipset is too old and theres some shaders thatre malfunctioning I dont know enough about mac hardware. ,SkyFactory,dfjnyvc,1,t5_33k9s

11513257,0,t3_64c2zq,Quartz in the atomic reconstructor one of the lootbags or sieving sponge this is from the top of my head so I might be wrong.In NEI you can look up recipes on what they make with items but also how you get them. Use that ,SkyFactory,dg112ht,3,t5_33k9s
11775962,0,t3_668nj1,Little late the party but I use refined storage to automatically feed my sieves food and my autohammers hammers. Just export any food thats already automated in your network. You use auto heavy sieves if you compress the items before theyre fed in to the sieves. I think they produce resources faster. ,SkyFactory,dguuavw,1,t5_33k9s
