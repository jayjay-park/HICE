9200288,0,t3_50ldr1,Just got my first one in the mail today.  I love it.  Its great quality for the price and Im a big fan of the style.  Especially like how you can see the gears moving in it.  I definitely recommend giving it a try.  They have a  off your first watch promo link at the top of their website homepage.  Also you can cancel whenever so its not like youre locked into a set number of months or anything.Edit heres a pic  ,WristSociety,d8i7d85,1,t5_3fm76
