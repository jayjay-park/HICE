One question for any who might know there was music being played before Neros set in the NME tent whilst we waited and it was brilliant! Id really like to know some of those songs if thats at all possible!,readingfestival,ck14r0l,3,t5_2u1wu

The info you have is publicly available to the point of being wrong  it just so happens you miscalled Guns And Roses? Yeah no. And when eFests finds out theres headliner trouble you miraculously do too?Talking shit. You dont know anything. ,readingfestival,czpy9ub,1,t5_2u1wu
