209945,0,t1_cf22fxv,Thats awesome dude glad you like it! The artist is Dave Schultz from Hanger  in London ON. From what I understand he is notorious for his work with colours... So doing such a great job on a black silhouette piece makes it that much more impressive. Not only am I so pleased with the finished product but I cant speak enough to how nice of a guy he is. Hes also done some awesome work for my two best friends. Not sure where youre from but its worth the trip!

I kind of like the way that he is holding his board and the ground he is standing on reminds me of home so I would like to incorporate both of those. The shaka idea is one that I hadnt considered but I really like it. The beach aspect is important to me but the surfer silhouette interests me more. Maybe tilting the board a little more so that you can see more fins? I am not sure. Also I try my best never to be mad it is a waste of time man. ,tattoo,cgcv0ow,2,t5_2qiud

As someone who has a blackout sleeveas in my whole arm is straight black I am so familiar with those bumps that skin can take a long time to heal especially if your artist is packing in heavy color. I wouldnt worry  about it at all. It will go down in the next couple of weeks and you will be left with just a solid single color. Make sure you still keep it out if the sun however because since it is still in that stage it can still scar.,tattoo,ctq7dyo,3,t5_2qiud

When a blowout does happen though the ink that bleeds out isnt as dark or noticeable as the ink that stays where its supposed to. So after time just like tattoos fade the ink that bled with the blowout will fade too.  Im glad I could help.

Ive never had an experience with an artists where they werent willing and excited to talk about their ideas.Artists will also have their works collected on either a personal site or their stores site. If it looks like their general style is varied and they have a good portfolio very strong likelihood that they are talented and passionate.If you are looking for something minimal to cover it up maybe just ask them for ideas say youre open to new ideas. If youre looking for something larger good chance they can find a way to work that in. Its their job not only to properly tattoo you with precision but also to be creative.Every good tattoo artist Ive met and heard about can draw as well as heshe tattoos so if they sketch up an idea you like go for it!,tattoo,d3croc0,1,t5_2qiud

This has nothing to do with the law. Its just that these companies only want to associate with artist in shops. Its an effort to prevent what you want to dotattoo at home.

They need to be touched up fairly often just like the palm of your hand but worse because youre constantly on your feet. Every part of the body has different skin as far as softer or thinner like the inside of a bicep. Painful and needs to be retouched so take that into consideration also a tattoo should be visible but thats just my opinion. I was a tattoo artist for about  years and I did one bottom of the foot tattoo and they had to come back a few times.

9366912,1,t3_58uf1h,Definitely need a touch up. Looks like your tattooer didnt get deep enough towards the upper left there. Also while he did do a slightly darker blue outline in a few years that thing is likely going to bleed out. Theres a reason most tattoos are outlined in black it keeps the lighter colors from spreading. I suggest tattooing a black outline.,tattoo,d93bn4t,-3,t5_2qiud

9375114,0,t3_58uf1h,I washed it about  times a day with lukewarm water and a gentle scentfree soap. I then used CAM Original TatWax Soothing Balm I applied a thin layer and repeated anytime I washed it. Once that tattoo started peeling and cracking I stopped using soap and just washed with lukewarm water and occasionally Id apply a thin layer of a lubriderm moisturizing lotion which was also scent free. I never picked or peeled at it. But it also swelled more than normal when I first got it.    ,tattoo,d94d1p8,1,t5_2qiud

10490957,0,t3_5q8eg7,My tattoo had a small amount of scabbing but not bad enough to where the ink was messed up. Best bet is to keep taking care of it until its completely healed and see about getting it touched up if the ink is messed up. Also nice SleepyCabin tattoo.,tattoo,dcx9drd,3,t5_2qiud

10837059,0,t3_5uvj7r,I think tattoos look different when you sit through a long session. I can agree it looks a little flat compared to the ones I see that are photo realistic. But I would argue that tattoo in  years might look better than most. Plus there is personal style. The artist and client might have went over  or  different options and that one was agreed upon. Or it was flash art chosen spur of the moment. I dont ask for opinions because when I pass by the mirror going into the shower I feel awesome even if the world hates the way it looks. ,tattoo,ddxrl02,1,t5_2qiud

10999660,0,t3_5x2ev7,If youre satisfied with the work but not the scheduling try just talking to your artist about it. They might be getting screwed by personal matters or a shop assistant thats putting too much on their plate. If its a scheduling thing and a quality of work issue then just cancel and find another artist if youre paid up for the work received you dont owe the current artist anything.,tattoo,dees1ek,1,t5_2qiud
11032965,0,t3_5xiljp,I dont know how opposed to it you would be but you could make all the sides thicker matching the thickness of the blowout. You would have a smaller center to it but it would still hold the rectangle shape or thicken up the rest of the line where the blowout is and extend the side by your knuckle a little closer to the knuckle leaving the side lines thinner.,tattoo,deik82h,6,t5_2qiud
