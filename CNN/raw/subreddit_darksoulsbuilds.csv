44688,0,t3_1um0le,Use Tattered cloth robe Catarina leggings and sorcerer gauntlets. This Setup gives you the best defense for a bit of poise ,darksoulsbuilds,cejiot2,1,t5_2t7at
155975,0,t1_cevwx5d,Fair point about not not being able to trade hits well but if thats the case why bother with so much poise? I should be able to trade hits with a twink since the host will have Estus on hand to heal me. I think wolf ring will be a must to get the amount of poise ill need. At the moment Ive been thinking about sticking with the longsword since it has decent range and speed with low stat reqs,darksoulsbuilds,cew73rv,1,t5_2t7at
254413,0,t1_cf73m4z,Even if you dont want to use the shield a grass crest shield on your back would give you more stamina regen. And blocking is certainly a good option for many situations,darksoulsbuilds,cf74i27,2,t5_2t7at

367288,0,t3_1y3w4u,gravelord sword gravelord from my personal armada adjust to your liking. I would keep the miracles and toss the pyromancer hand for a  composite bow with poison arrows. Inspiration came from this page ,darksoulsbuilds,cfiu27f,1,t5_2t7at
673108,0,t1_cggs2dy,Thanks for the advice.I would rather use a greatsword than the estoc to be honest. What armor and shield do you recommend?,darksoulsbuilds,cggs69a,1,t5_2t7at
686668,0,t1_cgibffc,I think the bleed meter is hard to fill up and PVE enemies just arent very fast to begin with. Bleed slows and reduces stamina. Im not sure how obvious that would be on an NPC. Its doesnt knock a hugh chunk of HP off like it used to in DS. ,darksoulsbuilds,cgibqbc,1,t5_2t7at
882747,0,t1_ch4mb29,Actually Id go with Greatsword. Its basically the Buster Sword from FF VII. That thing his like a truck but its heavy as hell. If you dont have it yet check the wharf again.,darksoulsbuilds,ch4mdv5,1,t5_2t7at
1001694,0,t3_25kdhw,Lvl up the glove. Get intfaith as a backup lvl stam and health gg. Use what spells are effective or that you like. Enjoy,darksoulsbuilds,chi5fio,1,t5_2t7at
1045329,0,t1_chn3tw9,To expand on that a bit if you want to use a weapon like a caestus example once upgraded to  normal reinforcement it gets AA scaling with strdex. So you would pump points into strdex.Anyone please correct me if theres anything Im wrong about.,darksoulsbuilds,chn3x31,2,t5_2t7at
1700671,0,t3_2dudus,I really like Syans Set for faith builds especially if you are a SunBro. The more gold the better. || PRAISE IT!For a shield you can choose between a greatshield or a standard depending on preference. The shield that skumbag is referring to is the Tower Shield which takes  STR to use. Otherwise youll be fine with any other shield with  physical damage resistance. For weapons its really up to you . Pick something you like using but Ill suggest a few below. STRDEX requirements listed after weapon. Im suggesting heavier weapons but something like an infused Mace with Lighting is amazing for a STRFTH build. Bluemoon Greatsword  Raw or Lighting. Raw can be good for backup. Heide Greatlance  This thing is beast with Sunlight Blade  Mastodon Halberd  Really powerful but have to hit with blade Old Knight Hammer  High damage RawLighting low durability. ,darksoulsbuilds,cjtj60v,2,t5_2t7at

5044893,0,t1_cuu3h4b, is the soft cap for twohanding your weapon. Its also just a good middle ground for damage while keeping your soul level low ,darksoulsbuilds,cuu3nmp,1,t5_2t7at
9150695,0,t3_4ohsxe,If you care about being optimised for PvP then Im sorry youre a little too late.  I gave it a whirl here   While I realise that you cannot easily subtract three points in Faith right now theres no reason why you couldnt save a bit on Vitality  youll just be a little more squishy. If you do not feel like going to NG to pick up another WotG spell feel free to replace one of them with Replenishment instead  it provides a boost to stamina regeneration in addition to slow health regeneration.  I replaced the Claymore which has very good Dexterity which you essentially have none of scaling with the ManSerpent Greatsword. It handles like the Bastard Sword but is a pure Strengthscaling weapon.  For Faith builds Sunlight or Darkmoon Blade are almost mandatory and for good reason  in this case it adds  lighting damage!  If you would like to start over I would also advise you to reconsider how many spells you need. WotG can be deadangled and is useful enough even with low casting speed and while Great Chaos Fireball can be used to some effect it takes up two whole slots and will take a long time to cast with base casting speed.  Points saved can go towards more Vitality or Endurance if you want to wear other armour pieces.  As for the armour I chose the first priority was to get you fast rolling and the second to get you sufficient poise  poise will let you take a hit from most anything without staggering bar twohanded ultra weapons and of course weapons with knockdown attacks Demon Great Machete and Titanite Catch Pole R come to mind.,darksoulsbuilds,d8bx0ql,1,t5_2t7at
