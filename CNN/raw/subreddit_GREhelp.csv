1029734,0,t3_25fyxp,Ive been using old study guides I find at thrift stores because they are super cheap.  My philosophy is that right now I am focusing on sharpening my skills so I dont need a precise guide to the test just yet.  Still from what I read in the older study guides I have the actual test has changed since then.,GREhelp,chlc493,1,t5_2s6vk
1988094,0,t1_ckrzbzq, hours a day with Sunday as an offday. I honestly spent one month on verbal and the next month on quantitative. For verbal I would start the day learning a set of  words. The next hour or hour and a half I would answer questions while watching every video walk through. For quantitative I would spend a day watching the entire lot of videos for each designated section. After I finished them I would honestly just work problems every day for  hours.  ,GREhelp,cksrl6r,2,t5_2s6vk

4125221,0,t1_crqh246,Ok so the answer to your question is to get a good strategy guide and start learning some strategies for the GRE.  Id recommend Manhattan Prep Princeton Review or similar just look up the reviews online.You should also be studying vocabulary explicitly. Do flash cards or whatever you need to do but learn them. Dont just pick random words either but look for GRE specific listsglossaries that are well reviewed.Come back with any questions! But yeah you need to start with a good strategy guide.,GREhelp,crqi0su,2,t5_2s6vk
4337226,0,t1_cseim0e,Hey I am glad you like my prep process ! I like to think that unless I am organised its really hard for me to train my mind to do well.I think its awesome you can get those high verbal scores because its a great confidence builder if you have high scores in one section right when you start.As for the quant section I faced the same issue as you face. What I did well was thinking hard about where exactly my silly mistakes were coming from. I read somewhere that if you call them silly mistakes you tend to take them lightly and think that ohh dammit I will definitely get this right the next time. At one stage I divided each Math problem solution effectively into . Reading question. Calculation. Checking my answer with what question precisely asks for.. Marking the correct optionBelieve me i had errors in all these phases of question solving. But with practice    went out....but i found that had to work on I later realized that because I mostly did all calculations in my head. I was getting all those errors. I simply starting writing my calculations down clearly. It made a huge difference.As for the fear of second math section I never lost that fear just focus on getting all things u r strong at  correct and hope that you dont get an insanely difficult question in the second section  generally if that happens even then u can get a perfect score. Remember I never got a perfect quant score in my practice.,GREhelp,csej9z7,1,t5_2s6vk
4387354,0,t1_csg4roo,Thanks for asking! I didnt improve as much as I wanted V Q This was my second attempt. I originally got a  in both sections. I noticed that the math sections were surprisingly heavy on probability a concept I was weak in. ,GREhelp,csk6wij,2,t5_2s6vk
4843596,0,t3_3h67uu,I had a locker in which I had to put everything except for the clothes I was wearing my ID and my pencils. The lockers were in a room just outside of the room with the computer stations and the testing proctors main job was essentially determining what was allowed through the doorway. I was able to leave to eat a snack if I wanted which I did during my  minute break but I had to go through the  seconds of the turn your pockets inside out process to get back in the test room.Pro Tip Use the break. Even if you feel like you want to keep rolling through the test and get done faster youre likely better off giving your body the break for a few minutes. I brought Advil and Pepto Bismol with me to take at the break along with some water and a granola bar.,GREhelp,cu52lip,3,t5_2s6vk
