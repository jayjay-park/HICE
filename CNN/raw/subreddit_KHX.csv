What it does is increase the damage of the rest of your medals by .For stronger medals the boost is closer to .For DiZAerithVivi thats until your next turn quite usefulFor HaynerPenceOlette thats only for the booster and the next medal not nearly as usefulThe level of the booster doesnt matter at all.

7337626,0,t3_4f1tc6,Statistically is there any reason to not use the guilt free medals over the nonorb rarer counterpart medals?  For instance comparing my lv KHSoravB vs. lv  Stitch guilt.  Both medals are identical in speed  gauge cost and singletarget.  In this example the Sora has  orb and it statistically doesnt stack up to the freebie.  Sora x.   lt Stitch x..  Should I just continue to level the freebies until better medals come out?  If so is it even worth trying to pull for the rarer medals thats ingame right now because in the end they are stastically weaker than the freebies if we cant guilt them.  Whats your opinion on this?  ,KHX,d2c8keq,1,t5_39uea

7506700,0,t1_d2v7hy1,Im going to have to disagree with uSudokuGod here.gtFirst you should get the  stars to  stars so that you can combine all  Simbas into one medal that will do more damage but it will only do more damage if you combine them when they are the same star level.You can do this but the better and less expensive option is the fuse the  without the skill into the  with the skill evolve that to  and then fuse the last  into the one you just evolved.,KHX,d2vh1w0,2,t5_39uea

7637369,0,t3_4jwhs2,For medal suggestions exactly what ddtrinh said.Guilt is a feature that you unlock once you clear quest . However! If you try to guilt a medal before you clear that quest the guilt wont happen and youll have to level up another medal to active the guilt later. If youre looking at the side bars picture you can safely get to the secondtolast point where you have the two  medals.Generally speaking FP players can be on par with Paying players. FP should fully max out the free medals using the guilt mentioned above as these are better than premium medals with no dots. See this guide for a list of free medals and where to get them Im running the following medals fully maxedguilted on my keyblades Wakka Young Herc Paine Tidus Rikku Stitch Selphie Donald Yuna,KHX,d3abqzd,2,t5_39uea
7641787,0,t3_4jwhs2,To answer the question about raising your medals to  Id say hold off on that until you have the room. Each one is about  in cost so until you have the cost to hold at least one of those plus two or three   medals Id hold off you lose a lot of power potential but then you can make up for it by having another  medal in another slot. Just focus on getting through the story missions as youll need to hit quest  before you can guilt medals and around then youll have a good chunk of orichalcum to boost up your keyblades. Also tip make sure you go through and get plenty of mythril gems during the events youll need a LOT of them in order to level up your keyblades you get a decent number of stones throughout the story and youll need the gems prior to the crystals and even then you wont need many crystals.,KHX,d3atuu0,2,t5_39uea

I have kept my Leon KH B as  because I have a  Cloud and so forth.Some reverse medals like Pete will be superior to his Upright Wakka counterpart even guilted due to the second slot in Treasure Trove becoming a Reverse slot.If you are going to use the two Hags on your keyblade keep them separate otherwise smoosh them.

Additionally you will need the Avatar Boards at one point or another. If youve got them all already you dont have to worry about it in the future now and can focus jewels on medal pools which is a good deal. ,KHX,d83sskk,1,t5_39uea
