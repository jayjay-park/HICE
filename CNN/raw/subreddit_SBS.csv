3879712,0,t1_cqyhp2x,Swagbucks already made it clear to Garwald immediately after FacelessAce went on a power trip that they had no involvement with what happened.  They were as confused as the rest of us.With the amount of backlash Im not surprised that Swagbucks would want to minimize the potential damage to their good name as a result and reached out to gain control of the sub a point now elaborated on in their updated post.  Its abundantly clear from their post that Swagbucks have zero interest in running the sub and want to return control to the community.  They basically paraphrased my words from when the drama initially went down that a community run sub is a far more valuable tool for users than a company sub would ever be.Just wanted to add that Swagbucks and Garwald already moderate the Swaganigans sub together and Garwald was responsible for building the relationship between Swagbucks and the reddit community.  Swagbucks isnt a villain in this drama.,SBS,cqyirms,11,t5_2r37f
3886771,0,t3_34xtbn,Its still better than anything I can imagine having come of faceless keeping it and reopening.  Now we just need to readjust our thinking about the sub a bit its a semiofficial sub ran by the community with a little oversight from the company.  I highly doubt theyll be hosting things such as the links to apk downloads for sideloading or video times in their sidebar any time soon.  They could get away with a small presence on a sub they had no control of that had things like that but they cant come right out and allow even minor exploits like this somewhere with even a hint of being official.  Now we have this sub for that stuff and that one for a more official communication channel.,SBS,cqzbqce,3,t5_2r37f
