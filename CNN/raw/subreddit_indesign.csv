230058,0,t1_cf4l21a,Well that sounds fantastic  will I still be able to individually place each item?Maybe it would be easier if I show you what Im doing. I own a magazine called The Menu Mag  it features only restaurant menus. At the bottom of each menu I have an info bar showing off the important info. The ads switch from left to right side depending on what page number it lands on when we go to print. So Im trying to make a template for each restaurant that has both the left and right facing pages to make it easiest when I go to put the book together. But instead of having the restaurant approve both left and right pages I just want to send them one approval. So to save myself from errors I want the second page to mirror the first pages info which is what the client will actually approve.Check it out here I guess what Im asking now if I copy all  or so items and paste them...can they all be moved around individually or will it be like one giant paste?Thank you soo much btw,indesign,cf4ldao,1,t5_2rmwz
465293,0,t3_1zexyc,We tried to do that where I worked the solution was outside of InDesign and resided in using a local folder that was linked with a hosted one. We used one of those  for a while I dont remember which one we tested them all and others too I dont remember which one was the best. Ultimately we went back to dropbox as it was more convenient and we didnt have lots of assets. Now its becoming an issue again and we think about coming back to those solutions.   Also I dont remember if there was one of those that was selective on the files that were downloaded on the users computer or if you have to download the whole folder on every computer maybe thats why we went back to dropbox that allows to sync only the wanted folder I truly dont remember  Sorry if my English doesnt make sense Im in a hurry if something is unclear feel free to ask and Ill provide clarificationbetter translation once Im back.,indesign,cft5lqf,2,t5_2rmwz

2921055,0,t3_2tkx5e,You can paste images into text boxes. Which means that you can have the photo of the person followed by a column break and then their name. Then you put in the next persons photo and then their name. After you do that you can just thread together all of the boxes together. A text box the size of the photo then the name text box then the next box the size of the photo.I really this sounds confusing. Let me know if you need extra help or this doesnt make sense.,indesign,co04smi,3,t5_2rmwz

3933011,0,t3_35i1d9,Use the Print Booklet feature to print your file to a PDF then proof it. You want to select perfect bound. Number of pages per signature is up to you. Whatever it is must be divisible by four. If yo want four sheets to a signature your signature size is  pages.You can also do it manually. Make your InDesign file normally one page at a time all pages in the correct order. Make a new InDesign file without facing pages each page is your spread size. If your page size is A portrait the new document is A landscape. Place the InDesign file one page at a time in the new file.This shows a simple  page saddle stitched signature imposed on four sheets. If you have  pages perfect bound book youll need three of these. For the next two just add  and  to every page number.,indesign,cr4lk0j,1,t5_2rmwz

If you click the drop down on the swatches palette toward the end of your work and Select All Unused then click on the trash can  you will have an idea what youre really using. Also...if you cant delete a swatch it is because it is in a linked file FIX IT especially if youre only printing a limited number of colors otherwise your printer will spend time fixing it and youll pay for that time. Furthermore near the end of your work  same drop down Add Unnamed Colors. FIX THEM TOO.

5409146,0,t3_3p2427,PSD and AI files imported into ID are not editable directly in ID that is correct. You can right click to edit the original in its native program and when you save and come back to InDesign it should automatically update. But you cannot directly edit those files in InDesign.My advice should you want to learn the program would be to recreate the forms from scratch with live text in InDesign and only using PSDs for images. You will find that ID is extremely robust for type styling.Its hard to say why your fields arent getting read. Are you sure you have the correct settings when exporting?

6450024,0,t3_43xvcv,Learning InDesign wont do much for your ability to lay out a document or direct others in doing so. Itll only help you understand how to use a software tool. If youre looking to make the jump youd want to put emphasis on learning  brushing up on general design principles before fixing on the software. Id recommend reading Elements of Typographic Style by Bringhurst Grid Systems in Graphic Design by MellerBrockman The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by TufteOnce youve read these especially Elements youll have a firmer idea for what needs your attention in InDesign and youll probably learn it faster. Because youll understand what you need to know versus just being faced with a ton of random features and attempting to find your way through them all.,indesign,czmh1fp,2,t5_2rmwz
8127242,0,t3_4qjazj,If youre presenting electronically a PDF is fine. I have a few that show the work put in like the finished ad on one page followed by pages showing the grid and the unedited PSD if there was a lot of work put it. It shows the depth of thought and work put into the ad. Another thing that works is multiple copies of the ad. A campaign might be based on one ad design done by a designer at the usual default page size of   . But that aspect ratio is never quite right for all placements so I need to make some subtleor even not so subtleadjustments to the ad size. That means adjusting the layout. That means having a grid. As the page size changes the grid changes and everything that aligns to the grid moves to maintain that alignment. Show a few different versions with the grid. That attention to detail shows experience and thought.You know what else shows attention to detail? Typography.

9369691,0,t1_d8ytzgr,For Header and Copy styles you should use Paragraph styles.  Character styles are meant for individual words or phrases within a paragraph. For instance if you needed a bit of bold or italic or superscript on a word or two you would use a Character Style.

9708189,0,t1_da8n6sx,Good to hear that it worked out!Sometimes its tough with booksmagazines because it depends pretty heavily on the equipment they use and software they have for pagination.Strange they gave you grief for the facing page margin gave you an issue considering how it gets removed either way.They probably requested the coverspine separately to have more control over the spine. Thats typically the way I send them these days too. Gives them a little more flexibility on paper stock with the folds.Congrats on your first book ... and have fun with InDesign becoming your goto program for formatting.

10077194,0,t3_5k3wo4,You mean with a plate out of register? It happens frequently on low cost print runs. Designwise you can anticipate it by minimizing the number of tint builds. For instance never use a built color for text in a pub like this. Converting your images to grayscale will help too.It looks like both of these ads held up OK.The other issue I see is maybe that the blue ad did not allow for enough gutter  hard to tell from this image.,indesign,dbl2vex,3,t5_2rmwz

11745560,0,t3_67f5an,What does the data look like now? You could try using date merge but for only  entries I would rather do it manually. I would set up the data in a text file with all the text for each entry in the right order. No formatting necessary. In InDesign I would set up a template with however many wines to a page I need I am guessing six. I would then use the data for one wine to set up exponent entry which I would duplicate on a master page. Use paragraph styles character styles and nested styles to format each line of the wines catalogue entry. Use the Next Style option in the paragraph style definition.For the text frame that holds the data set up an object style that applies the first paragraph style and uses the next style attribute. This way all the text can be formatted with one click. ,indesign,dgre0fa,2,t5_2rmwz
11783208,0,t3_6847qb,Pretty sure doing a Save As will remove the extra embedded data from your file and get the file size to shrink back down. If it still doesnt then your last resort it so export it as IDML and open that to recreate a fresh copy of the file.As for embedding all your images wouldnt it just be easier to use the Package feature? It will create a folder with all the fonts and images needed to print the image without needing a second copy of the file.And finally deleting the PSD and replacing it with a TIF seems fairly unnecessary too. I think you should have just been able to rightclick on the file in the Links palette and unembed it there. At which point you would need to Save As to slim it down still but easier than placing the file over again.,indesign,dgvny1j,3,t5_2rmwz
