811114,0,t1_cgwgvw2,In general online retailers are cheaper than brick and mortar stores. Why? You dont need a store. Yes you need storage but you dont need a store at a probably way more expensive location. And said store needs storage too and storage workers. So you cut out the cost for the store space the cost for employees on the floor the cost for products that get damaged while on display. Maybe it was a chain store too so they have one or a couple central storage spaces and it certainly would be cheaper for the company to sell them directly out of storage.,TalesFromTheCustomer,cgwh7ni,13,t5_2w8ws

If I give those tables the same great service I give other tables I average the same tip percentage off of them.  The reason they tip those other servers shitty is because they get shitty service.  Now confession time the other night I had a table of  high school students.  A small table you dont get a tip from isnt a huge deal because youll make your other tables.  But with a top you cant take as many tables at the same time.When I was  I was a shitty tipper.  My friends were shitty tippers.  Ive waited on tons of high school kids that were shitty tippers.  This group was sucking down their  waters like there was no tomorrow and everybody ordered the cheap special.  I didnt expect a great tip from them and even expressed that sentiment to a few coworkers.Regardless I gave them the same attention that I would anybody else.  I kept their waters filled.  There was no one else on at this time so I single handedly ran all of their trays of food and passed it out.  I even hooked them up with a few extras for free.And it totally payed off!  They each had individual checks and I got  from everybody.  And Ill vow right here never to judge based on age again.On behalf of my industry I apologize to you.

10610475,0,t3_5rst5h,About ten years ago I signed up for a cable internet and basic channel package since that was cheaper than just internet alone.  The guy never put the limiter on my cable so I got a lot more channels for free.  I even tried to tell them about it once but they never did anything about it so I just shrugged and got to enjoy more channels.On the other hand after closing my account with them and moving out of state I kept getting monthly bills from them.  Every time Id call them up and tell them it was a mistake and theyd say that oh they just hadnt sent over someone to shut off the service yet.
