Edit The downvote comment wasnt necessarily directed at you. I hit save then refreshed not  seconds later and it had been downvoted. Meaning whomever did it didnt even have time to read what I wrote. Edit But I still disagree about what kids are reading. Too often a child sees his mom reading a book and thinks mom likes to read and sees his dad reading a newspaper and thinks dad doesnt like to read simplifying it when in reality both count as reading. So then were left with boys who read comics and manga and graphic novels but tell people they dont like to read because they think only novels count. ,shutupandtakemymoney,chtd4cj,3,t5_2sge2

1110954,0,t1_chuiqtr,The title calls this Engineer Prints.  thats because engineers print on x x x and x paper.  There are engineering in every major city near every major city and sometimes in the middle of nowhere.  When engineers have to submit prints for filing or bidding they generally have to submit  sets.  that means they have to print anywhere between    pages of that  print shown above.  Well you can bet your sweet ass that engineers architects and contractors would be out of business and Engineer Prints would be a hell of a lot more successful. This is not the case.  Thats because places like Suffolk Lock and Key amp Blueprinting in Lindenhurst NY or Atlantic Blueprinting somewhere on long island print these huge sets for not soooo much money.  Its more like  a sheet if that.  This  per print business?  It makes me want to buy an OCE printer and dedicated pool so i can swim around in it like Scrooge McDuck.Youll prob ask why dont engineers and archs just print themselves?  easy.  bc its hard to determine a price for your printing for reimbursable purposes.  You pass the reproduction costs on to the client.  Engineers and Archs dont generate invoices for printing unless they have nothing better to do so they send a pdf with their prints out to the repro center fedex them to their client and send them two invoices.NOW... you can do the same.  you dont have to be an engineer you just have to call the place. Also im fairly certain that FedEx kinkos has huge printers also.,shutupandtakemymoney,chukny9,13,t5_2sge2

Heres the cooking timeline.Spend  minutes gathering appropriate sized fuel dry sticks preferably.Spend  minutes breaking those sticks into smaller chunks.Spend  minutes starting the fire  use a fire starter and tinder then gradually introduce some chunks.Spend another  minutes burning the chunks of wood and such to build up some coals.Start cookingCook for  minutes while adding a little more wood chunks as required.All that easily adds up to  minutes to heat up a couple cups of water or whatever.Option B  use an alcohol burner and be done in  to  minutes max.,shutupandtakemymoney,cm67ec8,3,t5_2sge2

5828951,0,t1_cxjo5qu,Decyde you have some good points here and I would love to answer them.This product has been out internationally for a few months and we have thousands of users who love being able to enjoy a cup of freshly brewed coffee while on the go. Others really enjoy the fact that they can use their favorite beans even when they are away from home. Whats more is that with enough beans you can make more coffee while youre out and about than if you had just one thermos full of coffee.There are many instances in which its hard to make a great cup of coffee whether its in a hotel which is where I use it a lot a long flight because to be fair airplane coffee really sucks or even while camping. Whats more is that for someone who drinks a lot of coffee the  dollars at a cafe really adds up if they are drinking more than  cups per day.We have people who do use it at their office perhaps because the offices coffee maker is old and gross or they have limited space and dont want to bring in a big appliance. Maybe their arent enough coffee drinkers in the office to warrant brewing a full pot at the end of the day.I guess what Im trying to get at is that there are innumerable situations in which a thermos would not be the ideal solution and a coffee shop is either too expensive or simply unavailable. The Cafflano is the bridge for that gap. Hope that answers your question!,shutupandtakemymoney,cxjp98r,6,t5_2sge2

9431333,0,t1_d9bhdhi,Hey  understood. We may need to refine the message a bit for people who may be interested in creating this type of art but dont have a lot of experience with long exposure even if they own a camera that does it since almost every camera does itPut simply pixelstick reads image info from images you load on an SD card and displays the image one vertical line at a time while you walk through the frame of a camera taking a long exposure. Because youre moving youll be more or less invisible in the final image but all of the light emanating from pixelstick will collect in the sensor and reconstruct the original image in midair. In the same way that you may have seen long exposures of people writing their name with sparklers etc. The most succinct way to demonstrate this is with this  second video that shows a tall handsome man who I cant identify maneuvering in front of a camera that is taking a  second exposure. Youll see in the final image that you cant see m...him at all you can only see the result of the light from pixelstick collecting. ,shutupandtakemymoney,d9bhicf,9,t5_2sge2

11131428,0,t3_5yxf6q,My biggest problem with wearing headphones in bed is that I sleep on my side. So I can never wear headphones because they just slam into my ear or at the worst distort the sound to wear its super loud in one ear and painful. I wanna know if I lay on my side will the sound still be well distributed to both ears or will it be really loud on the ear on the bedside. Also is the headband sizable or is it just stretch based? If its just stretchy then I fear it will get loose after a while. ,shutupandtakemymoney,detqk0v,37,t5_2sge2

11379356,0,t1_dflta6l,In comparison to Paraffin based candles yes. Whilst Im aware of the processes turning soy bean to wax Eco Friendly claims need to signify reduced or minimal harm to ecosystemsenvironment not that there is zero impact on them. As a candle has to burn and release heat youll be hard pressed to find a candle that can exist as entirely ecofriendly.Given the reduction in fossil fuel burning and chemicals released into the air of soy vs paraffin wax Id argue its a fair claim. ,shutupandtakemymoney,dfltx8z,-2,t5_2sge2
