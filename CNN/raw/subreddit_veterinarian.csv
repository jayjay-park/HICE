125865,0,t3_1veupy,A cat with dilated pupils can mean retinal detachments. In cats this is typically caused by high blood pressure so that is where I would start. In most cats depending on how long the retinas have been detached the retinas can reattach and the cat will regain vision on the proper blood pressure medication. It could also be genetic as in the cat was born with a retinal problem. If the pupils are dilated a regular veterinarian may be able to see them using only a transilluminator. They can check blood pressure and should prescribe a blood pressure medication Usually amlodipine However please keep in mind that most veterinarians only have two weeks of ophthalmology in vet school and most of the time it is an elective. If they dont seem confident then find a veterinary ophthalmologist in your area. You can go on www.acvo.org to find one.TLDR more than likely high blood pressure have a vet check blood pressure.Edit source I have worked for a veterinary ophthalmologist since  as a veterinary technician. All eyes all the time. ,veterinarian,cesriux,1,t5_2svcw
419767,0,t1_cfo9jdv,He has several small fatty deposits on him and if I recall correctly the last time he was at the vet she identified a small fatty deposit exactly where this bump is now. Its just x in width and depth now. I have a few dogexperienced friends telling me it could be just a large cyst thats bothering him hence his limp and another saying possibly a fatty corpuscle. ,veterinarian,cfo9w2d,1,t5_2svcw
1366662,0,t3_29p4a1,I had one other unusual case like this that ended up being a type of benign tumor. Your best bet is a biopsy. My advice is to see a dermatologist. You havent exhausted your diagnostic or treament options yet. Not even a little bit.,veterinarian,cinlm6r,1,t5_2svcw
1678052,0,t3_2dkrm4,OK.  Im a veterinarian have been for  years and I highly recommend that you NOT do this.  First of all practicing veterinary medicine without a license is against the law.  Secondly unless this has been diagnosed as a lipoma using a FNA you cannot assume it is a lipoma.  Boxers are mast cell tumor factories.  Third and perhaps most importantly it is difficult to suture a laceration on an awake dog with a local anesthetic.  It can be difficult to remove a tumor and suture the skin back nicely in an anesthetized dog.  Actually cutting out a tumor dissecting it off the underlying muscle tissue and hoping that there are not any big vessels supplying the tumor in an awake dog is a huge challenge no seasoned veterinary surgeon would take on.  A pingpong sized mass removal will give you a skin defect of probably a tennis ball diameter there is no sub q fat in that location to do a good  layer closure plus you are inexperienced and working on an animal that can get up and run off bleeding or just bite you.  The other thing to consider is this  a  yo boxer is like a  year old person.  A lipoma or any other type of tumor in that old of a dog is not going to change its life span.  If the tumor is not bothering the dog dont mess with it! Would you want someone cutting on you when you are a little old person in a nursing home?  Dont put this geriatric dog through the stress of this procedure you are planning.PS  Benedryl is never used even as a premedication for anesthesia.  It may make him sleepy but I guarandamntee that when you poke him with your local anesthesia he is not gonna be a happy dog.  ,veterinarian,cjqoj50,4,t5_2svcw

4244325,0,t1_cs40id0,Why go premed? Why are you not a nuclear physicist trying to solve the worlds power problems? Why are you not taking your love of science and trying to solve global warming? Youre argument makes you sound incredibly pretentious man. I understand wanting to know why people choose the career they do but damn...Honestly its because animals are better then people. ,veterinarian,cs41kgx,4,t5_2svcw
6599189,0,t3_45d0sc,Most commonly wounds in this area are Miliary dermatitis abscesses and skin infections.  I recommend that you GO TO THE VET.  Most of these are cured with a course of antibiotics and flea medication.  Topicals almost never work even on superficial wounds and it is too easy to get them in the eye.Source Veterinarian  years,veterinarian,d01wrnn,1,t5_2svcw
