309848,0,t1_cfcurlc,Well it sounds like its not the PSU or any kind of heat issue then which makes sense since you have a good power supply and your temps sound fine. I wouldnt buy a new PSU if you had no problem with OCCTFurMark.It sounds like something else is causing instability but Im no expert so I dont know. Have you had this happen in other games besides GW and Skyrim? Do you have any other graphics intensive games that run fine?If you dont have other games you could try running the Heaven Benchmark from Unigine free and see if it will run stably or not. I would try to start troubleshooting whatever you can and see if it makes a difference. Perhaps try running only  stick of RAM and see if that changes anything or try running with all extra hard drives and optical drives and any extra peripherals disconnected. Also try running MemTest to make sure all of your RAM is fine.PS I found this thread with a similar sounding problem. Despite my intuition that it shouldnt be the PSU based on your FurmarkOCCT results he says that was his problem in the end. So check out this thread.Perhaps also try PrimeFurMark,fixapc,cfcvtro,2,t5_30ane
