I called the pharmacy went back they fixed it I even told them about the one I took so I didnt get an extra one but Ive always been so nervous that I got red flagged somehow. I still go to the same pharmacy so Im guessing they arent too suspicious since Ive never had issues before or since but I know how you feel.

If I was given a reason not to it would give me something to go on but the reason we ask the pharmacy why they are asking us something is because we assume there must be a good reason but we cannot know all the interactions with all the drugs out there.

5272565,0,t1_cvlbq45,Gonna have a brief explanation of the Australian system here so may be slightly different elsewhere.When a new drug comes out on the market the manufacturer gets  years to recoup the costs of research and development under a patent. They get to set the price for each box of medication and works out a deal with the government as to how much they get paid. Once this patent is up and depending on how well the drug does other companies may want to try and muscle in on the monopoly and make their own profits. The original brands composition is still protected and no other company may use the exact same ingredients to produce their own product that is binder fillers etc. As long as the medication produced by other companies have the same active ingredient and is proven bioequivalent that is they work the same they are allowed on the market and in order to remain competitive they often ask for lower amounts than the brand name. It is up to the original brand if they want to maintain the original price they asked from the government which is why it appears more expensive produce their own generic which is the same product as the brand name in a different box and ask for less while also selling their brand name reduce the amount they ask for the brand name or stop producing altogether due to competition.,TalesFromThePharmacy,cvlmod1,2,t5_2v6of

She said she was going to the office to get things straightened out.When I came in for my next shift I saw that we had filled an rx for the patient.
