2306544,0,t3_2llwpk,As far as nonjoke facts Wayne seems to be a fan of trivia and inserts little facts into his songs sometimes e.g. Did you know that Zorro is Spanish for Fox? or how Sting Gordon Sumner used to be a school teacher,whoselineisitanyway,clwt07v,2,t5_2tayg

3541643,0,t1_cpu6vkb,You summed it up perfectly! It was the little things that made their chemistry so great. Two things I loved about it was whenever the rest of the cast ganged up on Ryan or Colin to tease them about something Ryan and Colin would never join in to pile on like if Wayne or Drew teased Colin for being bald Ryan wouldnt join in. The other thing was that in terms of pure HUMOR no one else could make Ryan break other than Colin! True bros indeed,whoselineisitanyway,cpvyx61,2,t5_2tayg

3983992,0,t1_craccb8,So for that scene the cast was generally doing Shakespearean lines inspired by hillbilly stereotypes e.g. interfamily relationships.Wayne instead acted as a hillbilly himself and quoted an actual line from Shakespeares The Two Gentlemen of Verona with the humor by my interpretation being the implausibility of a hillbilly accurately quoting Shakespeare.  When the crowd didnt respond  likely because theyve never readseen the play themselves  Wayne called them out on their uncultured ignorance.,whoselineisitanyway,craesag,27,t5_2tayg

Its not like Season  anymore like where it was GameGameBreakGameBreakGameBreakGameBreakCredits That was horrendous!Aisha has toned down and become quite relaxed Banter is ever present now The guys have been finding ways to rag and tease Aisha. Seeing Good Chemistry all around. Different games have been thrown into the mix too. Theyve started to really bring back some older games that were gems from the early US run and UK run I think youll really enjoy the newest Season and Season  despite the special guest element anyhow. ,whoselineisitanyway,ctfuo7c,2,t5_2tayg

7884070,0,t1_d426ewq,I didnt mind Thank God Youre Here however some of the guests on it were definitely not my cup of tea and a lot of them probably wouldnt be suited to the far less railroaded improv that Whose Line goes for.From TGYH Shaun Micallef Frank Woodley Julia Zemiro and Angus Sampson might be good for it. As for other people who didnt appear on it  I agree there isnt really a huge talent pool at least of well known people.Then again they may well do what they did in the UK and US  do auditions with improv groups and get people from there. After all thats how they got Colin Mochrie.,whoselineisitanyway,d428qfj,1,t5_2tayg
