This isnt to alter your voice but the audio does seem a bit hallow and like I said I dont mean this disrespectfully. Also if you dont already do so try recording your voice separately from the game audio. It makes it easier to edit and we all know editing is a pain in the ASS. Other than that the video is great.

Just wish wed see more of Matt Peake although I read somewhere he doesnt want to be in front of the camera much right? . The community has been just as equally awesome love all the fanart so much you guys are legitimately so talented! I wish I could contribute to the community in a similar manner but unfortunately my artistic skills are severely lacking p Ive recently subbed to Spooles Twitch channel its really fun there and the chat is always entertaining! Will subscribe to Lawrence soon enough once I get more money into my bank account...To be honest Im currently studying in France in a really tough environment in a special school preparing me for engineering school so Im really happy this community exists for me to just vamp and relax after class. We start early study all day long till pm even during the weekends and consistently have homework. Not to mention hour tests every saturday morning. Im doing moderately well but psychologically this is much harder than it seems. I may be asian but lol my math skills really arent that good DANYWAY. Just wanted to throw that out there! Thanks Funhaus you guys always cheer me up after class and remind me life isnt always about equations I dont understand and teachers yelling at me  P.S Sorry if my english is a little awkward sometimes not my first language and sorry AGAIN for the long postP.S  If anyone wants to talk to me in whatever way feel free to do so always enjoy meeting new people especially youre at all into JpopKpopAnime or any of that weird asian culture p,funhaus,cp7ba5y,10,t5_35b7i

3783183,0,t3_33qqoj,I really like the idea of this series. Something that sets FunHaus apart from RTAH is how they deal with and interact with fans and that makes them very special imho.  years of watching AHRT and I cant name any fans just by watching videos interacting with fans isnt something that really comes up with them excluding hiring a few of them. After just a few months of watching IGFH I can name more than a handful of fans off the top of my head. I think thats a real important difference and it certainly gives these guys a different feel. Anything that gives you more of that edge of interacting with and having an actual legit twoway conversation with fansviewers is a positive.

Theyll look at pros and cons from any argument and explain them in a safe and nonconfrontational way. Which is respectable. We could use less fingerpointing and insulting from time to time.

3790583,1,t1_cqnm2nk,Hijacking this to say one thing about the video. Not expecting a response or anything but please give this a read.I think most people want just YOU guys to have a daily news show. They DONT want to have to randomly click on The Know videos hoping that the video is you guys and not some other youtubers we might not find as entertaining. Even if the scriptstudioeditingetc. is exactly the same the people presenting are a huge part and some of us VASTLY prefer you guys over the other people on there.That being said I hated ETC when I first started watching IGD but after a while of never watching the former I started to check it out a little. Now I watch them every day.I think the title of the video should reflect the hosts of the video so there is nothing hidden from the audience and they can quickly gauge if they would like to watch the video or not. It might seem counter intuitive to give viewers a reason to be selective with the videos they watch but if you guys just got a different title when the episode stars the FH crew maybe something like On the Haus or Full Haus or some other house related pun I think it could hypothetically boost views on all The Know videos. The amount of time spent on the channel looking for the content I want to watch as a viewer would be minimized and I might be a lot more likely to check out regular The Know videos out of curiosity and a lot less likely to frustratedly click away when I dont know the hosts.Thanks for reading.,funhaus,cqocuqw,0,t5_35b7i

3872315,0,t3_34rqn2,To my knowledge adbased revenue generated through YouTube videos is clickbased whether or not a viewer follows the video ad link and revenue via YouTubes newly revamped monetization formula is based now on the frequency of uploaded content and watch duration. I signed up very briefly with Google Ad Sense when I was making really shitty liveaction skits with my friends and most of the revenue there was clickbased. This was  and a half years ago so Im sure thats real helpful now with the YouTube platform changing nearly every month.Would be very interested to learn what the case actually is from a Verified YouTube Content Creator.,funhaus,cqxoe32,3,t5_35b7i
3874922,0,t1_cqxyk09,Oh many many. Ill try to list a few down does anyone remembers  the aircraft carrier from single player? Well the scripting team being the amazing guys they are duplicated it and made it able to be moved wherever you wanted it with just one command you could drive it like a normal vehicle. They also added all the elevators and lifts on the carrier with hydras and apaches that spawned on it they would despawn when moved and respawn when stopped. So being in full control of a military with that sort of power is always a thrill. there were also many joint operations with all the other factions  LSPD NOOSE FBI where a huge group would overpower the police department and we would be called in for relief. We would all upwards of  people be in one teamspeak this is how everyone communicated channel and itd be amazing hearing command shout orders to their respective departments. i think the best moments I have to say is the times you would be sitting in a teamspeak channel with your faction members just shooting the shit not talking about much other than your personal life or things going on in the world. I met some of the greatest guys there some of which I still talk to today not even about gaming. I even remember once entering the channel of the biggest toughest gangs  in the server  and them discussing American politics lol good times,funhaus,cqxz3a5,3,t5_35b7i

4231759,0,t1_cs2k7j0,Actually Adam the lore is only subjective sometimes and rarely even. A lot of the lore just isnt explained directly. Its told through environment design a bit of character dialogue a lot of it is also through item descriptions too which is why item descriptions fill loading screens all the time.Aside from that though I assure you that at least fans of funhaus like me who are also people with like hours collective of all  souls games know why you dont think the game is as great as some people may make it seem.Something Ive noticed is that game designers seem to love the series obsessively because the game has a LOT of very tight game design. That is not to say its very time efficient though if you havent got the time to play the souls series or at least get to know it well one time rushing it is going to be a bad experience cause you cant rush it and the game IS going to punish you for trying to without sufficient knowledge.editsidenote If any of you are interested at all look up lore videos for any of the souls franchise on youtube. Theres an extensive amount of lore for almost every boss in each game its rather interesting and who knows might give you something to get excited about more. The lore doesnt exactly contain spoilers as the game isnt about the lore much either or at least it doesnt need to be.

Not for what it is I actually do still really love this game and I really do want to replay the entire game again when I watch the Funhaus Live recordings. In fact I would totally do a  hour livestream of both Shenmue I and II if I had the equipment. The argument that there are better games is just null to me. Its like saying there are better more evolved games than Super Mario World or Resident Evil  but even then there are still people who consider those the best games ever made and still love playing those games even to this day.. Now I understand thats not the whole point of that argument rather they were saying that the mold has formed to be more beautiful and has changed to be more accessible to everyone and I do recommend other sandbox games than I would Shenmue. Just like I wouldnt recommend Resident Evil  when theres Resident Evil HD Remake but I would recommend Super Mario World still I mean that games perfect. Im not blind I know Shenmue aint perfect nor is it for everyone but it is an experience for anyone who is curious enough and its a damn fine game for people who are interested in slow paced mysteryaction games. P.S Sonic Adventure is awesome? Uuuhhh yeah I think I know what James meant when he said I dont hate the game but something about gagging every time he hears the game.

If youre not familiar with confirmation bias please take this little quiz.Not wanting to hear no is totally natural and it takes quite a bit of practice to stop this habit. In the future I just hope you guys instead of asking does this make sense? ask yourselves two separate questions why does this make sense? as well as why does this not make sense?I think it would result in a more productive and interesting conversation that is balanced instead of trying to convince ourselves what weve heard is true.Anyway! That being said Im not very familiar with Valve or any of their games so its hard for me to take a side. I think this one does sound more legit than others though.,funhaus,ctf6ma1,0,t5_35b7i

Youve delt with comments extremely professionally and directly which as a huge fan is lovely to see. Im sure Lawrence has done his homework about it all none of the rest of you lot do any fucking work and you all obviously have faith in your sources. Did you approach the source or did heshe approach you? Also does any of this ever discourage you from publishing stories like this? I hope not!Im very intrigued to see how it all pans out.

In this podcast you said along the lines of  I dont need to prove i am right because i know i am right in relation to the information from your source. When you received the information you had from your source was it concrete information or was it a rumor like previous information you have received.For example the Dark souls information and the tomb raider release date.

Im not sure who was also very careful about not saying anything about the state of development of HL while countering some of the things that source said about the general way HL and  were created to my knowledge Valve has not issued an official statement about this whole thing. Anyway you can decide to believe whoever you want thats for sure. I just find it quite interesting that the people who are jumping down funhaus throat for believing an anonymous source whos not so anonymous to them are the same people who dont even acknowledge the possibility that Laidlaw might not be at liberty to say whatever he wantsknows or that he might not even know everything.,funhaus,ctkjmn6,-1,t5_35b7i

4873185,0,t1_cu8rnsj,I understand that not all times popularity quality but if a opinion on something is universal it pretty much becomes fact. Thats how I see it. Think of it in football. There are plenty of opinions on who the best QB is but if most of the league and fans were to say Aaron Rodgers is the best QB then it shouldnt be hard to except that he is the best QB. If those are the reasons why they love those characters in the first place then they mustve liked the movie. Obscure aloof offbeat and unexpected describes the movie pretty well. You cant compare it to any other Marvel or superhero film really its very different. Im also confused as to what you mean by cheap plot device at the end. Maybe you mean Starlord grabbing the stone and all? They kinda set that up from the beginning of the film and it goes with his character in the comics as hes only half human. Im fine with different opinions I just mostly have a problem with people who have those different opinions insulting and bashing those who like the film and calling it garbage among other things. If you didnt like the film fine man but dont insult those who did enjoy it. Just say it wasnt your cup of tea or whatever.You have to admit things like this happens a lot nowadays.

Personally I have always enjoyed James and Elyses videos cause they put out fantastic gameplay videos they have great comedic chemistry and usually bring in a topic for conversation with each of their videos to make them even more interesting. They stream every so often but they always upload their streams to youtube.I also like to watch Lawrence and Spooles stream whenever I get a chance to. They are always pretty interactive with their chat and have fun gameplay to accompany it. The only problem is that Im on EST so they stream pretty late for me. But it all depends what youre interested in. I like watching everyone from time to time. I can watch Adams videos but he doesnt release as often Bruce has some cool CSGO videos Joel streams every once in awhile with his buddy just drawing funny shit. Ill link some stuff below for you to check out and you can experiment with what you like. James and Elyse play Layers of Fear funny and cute but if you dont like scary then it might not be for you Bruce playing CSGO Adams tips for gaming thumbnails Joels stream Spooles stream Lawrences stream Peakes advice on loveHope you enjoy dudedudet!

No I dont mean tits and asses but the actual storyline. Yes there is more than enough tits and asses for everyone. Subete ga F ni Naru The Perfect InsiderI want to like you Perfect Insider. I REALLY want to like you but fuck you and your fucking murder shit. Give me a good philosophical anime. I know you want to be that a smart anime for smart people who like smart stuff. Not some murder stuff we already have a goodish murder anime this season and we had a bullshit trap anime last season Ok Rokka no Yuusha wasnt that bad. It just was very very flawed in the execution and the ending of the first season is completely unpredictable. Well in the way that the anime was clearly not informing you about the stuff you needed to know while setting up several guilty parties. Taimadou Gakuen  Shiken ShoutaiFun so far even though I am not the biggest friend of the mechamagic anime thing... Its a little stupid. Other than that pretty good. Sakurakosan no Ashimoto ni wa Shitai ga UmatteiruThe goodish murder anime of this season. This shit is even scientifically correct and not some Conanstyle bullshit. Just be sure that you like bones.. there are a lot of bones in this anime. Yuru Yuri SanHai!WHERE IS MY OPENING?! WHY WAS AKARI REMOVED FROM THE INTRO?! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WRITERS OF YURU YURI?? WHAT IS THIS CRUEL WORLD WE LIVE IN? Yeah its still fun just slightly annoyed by the lack of the intro from the previous seasons. OsomatsusanFor the rebirth of a very old anime I must say I enjoy it. Some jokes have aged with time but it still pulls off a lot of good jokes. One Punch ManIf you dont watch One Punch Man already just shut up grab a bag of chips or whatever you fucking english people call them fucking stuff them into your face hole and be amazed by his ability of one punching stuff. Comet LuciferLooks ok gotta continue it at some point. Probably will be your average mecha anime but so far its not too bad. Onsen Yousei HakonechanIts short. Its cute. It doesnt take much time out of your day. KowabonKowabon is interesting. Better said the idea behind it is interesting. Forgot about it on mistake because of the awesomeness of OPM and then some other stuff like HoT happened so Ill probably catch up on it soon. Utawarerumono Itsuwari no KamenNo this is the real surprise winner for me this season. Its actually even fighting over the first place of best anime of this season with OPM because OPM is awesome. Why arent you watching it yet? GO WATCH YOU IT! My only hope is that it wont be so heavy on the harem side of things and tend more to the economical and political side of it but it has the potential to turn into a amazing anime. Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry  Gakusen Toshi Asteriskuhm... literally THE SAME FIRST EPISODE. so watch what you like more. Fire Girl Love Interest A or B Concrete Revolutio Choujin GensouMy God so many colors. And stuff happens and it all seems to like to one big goals? Call me interested.Noragami AragotoSecond season of Noragami still pretty good. Heavy ObjectI like Heavy Object. Hopefully it wont turn into a every two episodes they destroy a object and becomes these leet mlg object destroyers. Maybe fuck up once or so.  Himechan is adorable. Miss Monochrome The Animation FUCK YOU MISS MONOCHROME IS BEST IDOL! I WILL FIGHT YOU!and thats what I am watching.. FUCK YOU AMERICANS AND YOUR FAKE DRESS UP BULLSHIT HOLIDAY!

I am curious to see what would happen if developers started increasing the dev. time and released games later would people get upset that games arent coming out sooner? I feel like developers are under pressure from the community and competitors to put out games which could be part of why were seeing less polish on new titles. However consumers keep buying these broken games which leads me to believe that publishers feel they can get away with rushing the dev. process and release a sixeighths complete game.,funhaus,cy1qj53,3,t5_35b7i

6024093,0,t3_3xyou5,I think the struggle in this podcast is that alcohol and nicotine are definable chemical altering drugs that result in a chemical addiction. Video games are more of an emotional addiction like gambling so alcohol and nicotine are not valid comparisons. Gambling is a valid addiction so video game addiction is equally valid video slot machines etc but it is really hard to legally blame the companies. I agree with Adam that holding the companies responsible is tough when it comes down to individual mental health versus a universally altering chemical addiction like nicotine. You want the reward take the chemical but in video games you want the reward you must take an action and play the game. It is behavioural.I have no doubt that video games alter the chemical balance in the brain but the trigger is behavioural unlike nicotine which is chemical. I want the high I play the game. Video game companies want to maximize the chance for that behaviour by formulating a reward for it almost sounds like dog training. But because it is behaviour and not a chemical the user is held accountable. Actions are ultimately controlled by choice and choice is up to the user not the company. The company cant control the user. So legally you are going after the wrong enemy. The user is vulnerable and when he is mentally down bored angry. You play the game do something in it that is enjoyable boom you feel better. Rinse and repeat.So if you want to regulate it you would have to do it culturally because ultimately we play video games for the enjoyment. Enjoyment is the reward that can supplant a negative feeling and that can get addicting if we do it only when we are feeling down. Ultimately it is temporary so we have to do it again and again. So the situation is also important and that also falls to the user. Regulation may be necessary but I dont think government regulation of companies is the answer.Edit I suck at proof reading.,funhaus,cy9a4kt,11,t5_35b7i

While unwinding from work I decided to break open a bottle of Glenlivet and browse some reddit. Upon doing so I read the post regarding Joels departure and miiiight have had a little too much while watching through Open Haus videos on a playlist. Things get fuzzy and interesting from there. I woke up just a couple hours ago on the floor of my bathroom. Upon checking my computer there were two video files titled FOR THE FANCY BOY OF FUNHAUS or something to that effect. I opened one up and saw exactly what I posted on my channel. The second one was pretty good too so here I am posting the link to that one as well. Joel if you see these I hope you enjoy em  you are a pretty cool dude and your hair is on a level that surpasses even the likes of Jack Donaghy! Thanks for all the good vibes ltEDIT In honor of Joels descriptions I wrote a rather elaborate one of my own and tucked it into both vids.

Its not a decrease in quality per say but more of a overall uninteresting and boring entertainment content.Just look at RWBY. The show had great potential but potential needs to be used and it didnt. It just pilled up on writing and continuation errors to a point where season  will be just plain bad.

Im definitely not in favour of telling people that their justification for choosing one channel over the other is not a welcome talking point or that it shouldnt be said because it might cause arseholes to come out of the woodwork. The post is there to promote discussion and if we have to censor ourselves because a couple people might jump in and say shit to rile others up then its a very very bad precedent for the subreddit. Thats why a downvote and report button exists.As for fostering an attitude if ones stance is so easily swayed by a majorityminority position or a couple arseholes then they arent really thinking for themselves in the first place and that reaction is independent of whichever sub they choose to participate in.

If it had just been a straight up adaptation set in Hong Kong with Dicaprio cast as Chan Wingyan and Jack Nicholson playing a triad boss then people probably would have complained about that too.It might just be because Ghost In the Shell is a more well known franchise but equally I cant remember any controversy about Tom Cruise being cast in Edge of Tomorrow because they just took the premise of All You Need is Kill and transplanted it to a place where the casting made sense.,funhaus,d31g2gb,33,t5_35b7i

7758093,0,t1_d3nbngy,doesnt look like anyone replying to your comment thinks so but I feel like im less and less interested. and I have to say mainly because the jokes just seem increasingly offensive and reactionary and provoking even... I feel like its the same semioffensive basic comedy jokes over and over again. Im not really sure if it was always like that and Im just realizing it more now. But yeah. I just find myself watching less and less because its just the same stuff over and over. in my opinion at least.And I think that definitely counts as a decline in quality. I love funhaus and the community especially the way the interact with the community. But I do gotta say that whenever say on the comments show or something they read a comment by someone who has a disagreement or a discussion about something they dont like they sort of dont take it seriously shut it down and like imply that no one else agrees. Ive seen a lot of people say the stuff that I said in the first paragraph and Im kinda worried that theyre going to ignore what the audience wants and sort of ruin themselves? But of course I dont have all of the opinions from every single person in the community so I cant tell for sure what the real story is.so yeah I could be completely wrong but thats what i think and thats what the community that I interact with seems to think at least.sorry for the wall of text!EDIT also when I go back and look at older inside gaming or even early funhaus stuff I enjoy it a lot more than recent stuff. I dont see as much like shitty game series and stuff like that which really made the channel unique imo.,funhaus,d3o1awo,10,t5_35b7i

8317146,1,t1_d5gjkxz,Edit I was implying they work more than  hours a week.  Fucking idiots.Ill take a guess for just Michael because we honestly know the most about what he does.  Lets assume he works exactly a  hour week I suspect he doesnt.  Just as I suspect Funhaus works  hours at minimum you guys both work hard and I dont see anyone having a quitting time work ethic.Michael has voice acting for multiple showsmaybe  hours a week is on three podcastsmaybe up to  hours a week.  That should give him about  hours for meetings production on unreleased shows and AH.  Ill venture Michael is in the AH office at least  hours a day based on the number of videos put out.   works hours left to spread between all else.  To me that seems like a pretty packed week at times.However I feel like Funhaus works very hard as well and I KNOW that if funhaus was on the same grounds as the rest of RT you guys would be roped into all that extra stuff as well but you probably have all those editors to help you out. Now Ive been enjoying Funhaus videos over AH ones since you guys have joined that family already bickering like real step kids would is that DESPITE having less production valueproduction costs not saying you guys put in less effort DESPITE you guys putting out less videos than AH its too many to watch at this point. Maybe Im aging out as my career is starting.  Maybe its that the people who are making the content I love are editing the videos I love.  Maybe you are just better editors.  Id rather have a great video that takes a bit longer to make than  videos that seem forced out.  You guys truly seems like you card more about your work than AH does at times and that could be because you need to cherish those  hours.,funhaus,d5h772i,0,t5_35b7i

Maybe these guys are just really good actors pretending to be genuinely upset but that doesnt make this video NOT just watching a bunch of dudes get upset about losing at a video game.Know what was awesome? When Funhaus won CS not because of how Funhaus acted Bruce freaking out was kinda awkward but because of how Screwattack Editit was actually The Creatures handled it. The screaming and the falling over and the The timer went! The timer went! stuff because they were so clearly over the top.This stuff doesnt feel over the top enough it falls into that weird category where everyone just seems mad. If were gonna do WWE personas then lets actually do them freak out and whip a chair across a room or something scream at people call someone a bitch.

8564495,0,t3_4x208g,Heres my opinion of suicide squad. Spoilers obviously.I liked it. It has a ton of obvious problems but I generally enjoyed it. Im a huge comic book fan more so marvel than dc and I hated bvs but I thought this movie was good. Not great but good. I liked it better than the iron man and Thor sequels. Probably on the same level as the incredible hulk. I feel like one of the things that saves the movie for me are the characters. I loved them. Ive never even cared about Harley Quinn in the comics but this movie made me like her. This also leads me to my biggest problem with the film which was the editing. It was awful. Some scenes felt like they were made solely for trailers and it was just really weird. And the way it tried to handle so many characters was really bad. Boomerang killer croc and katana were barely in the movie and I wouldve loved to see more of them. Civil war did an amazing job of giving every character in that movie a perfect amount of scenes and screen time even for characters that are barely in the movie. Suicide squad did the exact opposite. And it sucks because I thought the actors did a great job and I wanted to see more of them. Even the joker though his design was garbage and the editing of some of his scenes were really cringey.I agree with basically everything funhaus said about the movie and Im fine with people not liking the movie but I enjoyed it for what it was but definitely feel like the studios messed with what could have been an even better movie.,funhaus,d6c52ds,7,t5_35b7i

8814382,0,t3_50n1wn,So there was this one time I watched the movie Rush and then some time after I watch a Funhaus GTA race. As a result it had occurred to me during all the car crashes what the true difference between the racing abilities of a gamer pretending to be a deranged criminal millionaire racing in a supercar and an actual F driver. The difference is that the gamer will pretty much always floor or without thinking which results in crashes while the F driver will pace themselves in order to prevent themselves from crashing and create an ideal situation to overtake their opponents so that they can win.Anyway this video reminded me of that thought.

11275361,0,t1_dfa0gyp,gt He repeatedly stated that he was against equal marriage. Thats like the minimum that I expect from someone saying theyre proLGBTQ.He reneged on that though and upheld Obamas LGBTQ discrimination law for gov jobs. Once gay marriage passed he kind of just ignored it as far as I saw.gtWhich seems a contradiction to the libertarians view on personal liberty no? You personally can choose not to but theres no right to restrict it to others who choose it.This is one of the main splits in the libertarian camp. Is it personal liberty for the mother or the child within her? It depends where you think life starts whether at conception after first trimester etc. The libertarian party is officially prochoice though. So Im not so invested that it truly swings my vote.gtWhich he can do without blanket statements condemning every Muslim Hispanic Black Asian or any other POC.gtAlmost as if his motivations are racist.Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity or something like that. A few blanket statements were bad but I dont see the racist motivation or characteristic at all.gtIs there any reason why you didnt consider voting Clinton at all? Bernie put his support behind her as well as  of his supporters. She was the next best candidate that ran across all Parties.Bernies support meant nothing to me. I didnt see her as next best in the final election or the primaries. Some of the things I didnt care forHer economic policies didnt entice me she has been messing up in the ME the past decades her foreign policy helped Iran nuclear deal just wasnt good for me she was extremely for gun control which I see as a important right. Also I just equally dont like her character just like I voted for Trumps issues not him acting like a child sometimes.Edit And Like I said I would have voted libertarian if I thought it could pull the vote.

11515326,1,t1_dg1652o,While already addressed repeatedly and part of that bullshit I said to ignoreThere is a big difference between FH and Pewdies. And funny enough it has to do with safe spacesFH only do hilariously horrific antisemitic and  mocking and so forth content in videos that are filmed in closed situations. They are in a car or having a quiet conversation or in an actual studio or at a comedy event. They arent on the street talking to randos.Pewdiepie crossed the line. He paid someone to hold up an antisemetic sign in public. I am sure everyone on his youtube channel found it funny but all the other people who saw it just saw a little bit more hatespeech in their lives.And when that happens you have a guy with a history of what we assumed were jokes suddenly paying for antisemitic propaganda to be presented to the public. That makes it a lot harder to argue as a joke.Fortunately there are two ways to get away from that. You immediately say I fucked up it wont happen again and possibly force youtube to address how your money is distributed... sorry couldnt help but stay on topic or you double down and say It was a joke cant you take a joke? Fucking youtube are a bunch of Nazis amiright?. The former is what you see happening now and the latter is what Pewdie did.It is a lot like with Jontron yay more bullshit He has a long history of saying some stupid shit that most people treated as a joke.

11524726,0,t1_dg25tyb,WSJ wrote some articles about the bad. racist stuff on YouTube with Pewdepie as the main target which cost him and YT in general some advertisers.  The bigger issue is the UK Government found out ads it was paying for advertising Govt services and what not were appearing on Jihadist and white supremecist videos meaning the government was funding indirectly some pretty heinous people. Once that scandal broke a bunch of major corporations both in the UK and the US pulled their YT advertising until they could be assured that theyre ads would only appear on safe videos. Most of Funhaus stuff isnt currently considered safe for advertisers by YT who have massively overreacted so theres been a huge drop in the revenue Funhaus and the rest of RT and a lot of other video producers have been receiving from Youtube.,funhaus,dg2bvoq,40,t5_35b7i

11593092,0,t1_dg9zptz, sure he is. When I saw the trailer when Luke said that line I immediately thought No more Jedi no more Sith. Only the Force. The Jedi were all about being perfect and completely fair which as weve seen doesnt exactly work. Instead of using the Force to be a beacon of perfection just use it as a tool as an extension of ones self. Tools arent perfect. Theyre there to get the job done. And the Force isnt just something you play around with or use for every whim. The Force is its own. It moves on its own and gives as well as takes. Utilizing it for only good or only bad sacrifices part of yourself. I dont know where Im going with this but Balance.,funhaus,dga32tx,20,t5_35b7i

11642557,0,t1_dgfp3p4,Heres a sneak peek of rAgainstHateSubreddits using the top posts of all time! raltright has been banned!!! |  comments   Less than  hours since they harassed Jill Stein on Facebook a new front page post on theDonald organizes sabotaging her recount efforts by spamming her site with fake volunteer applications. This is a clear pattern of harassment. Where are the admins on this? |  comments   TheDonald is systematically following the hate sub formula post fakeexaggeratedmisleading reports from far right sites and invite agitators to land top comments that call for violence against innocent people. PizzaGate was used by them to direct violence and these posts want the same. |  commentsIm a bot beep boop | Downvote to remove | Contact me | Info | Optout,funhaus,dgfp494,1,t5_35b7i
