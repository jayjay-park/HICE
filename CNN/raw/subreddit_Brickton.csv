2617299,0,t3_2ptn2f,What a great farewell. I wish I had the right to give such a speech when I left the Grove.  Sadly many districts seem to be pretty closedminded. But I do believe you can bring your wisdom on openness to other districts and produce change. Being in the Sand Dunes I personally suggest there because I believe the region to be pretty open plus there is the bonus of getting confused with CoalJSJ and Bear.,Brickton,cn07wt3,4,t5_32qpm

11611745,0,t1_dgc75m6,Brickton seems to have done a similar to what DD did from first impressions. Splintering off into smaller and smaller groups many leaving for other communities many leaving in general leaving a few behind. Can I also ask did Brickton go through a period of near complete death after the splintering of the community and collapse of a common interest? Or did the few that are there now manage to ride the tide? ,Brickton,dgc798v,1,t5_32qpm
