1799744,0,t3_2f4ttq,It became clear after undergrad that I was going to have to spend  years doing someones CAD bitchwork in the industry before anyone trusted me with anything intellectually stimulating or interesting. So I decided that is rather spend those  years doing legitimate and engaging research in pursuit of a thesis. I was already on the fence with industry versus research anyway. After  years of this I can safely say that I prefer RampD. Theres a lot of professional satisfaction for me in being on the cutting edge for me. I dont feel like Im pigeonholed into the academia either. My work here has helped me establish a professional network ranging from NASA Glenn to GE Research. Ive come to know enough people who have acquired nonacademic careers following the same path Im on right now that Im not worried about my ability to do the same if I wanted to.,EngineeringGradSchool,ck60grb,9,t5_33br2
