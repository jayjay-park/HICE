1257850,0,t1_cian14l,I certainly wouldnt call that kind of thing lame. If everyone is happily immersed in the fiction the game provides and collectively adds to it then that is no different to actively visualising a book or becoming lost in a movie or TV series. Lame situations in multiplayer gaming to me is when you have a dictatorial RP person in the group trying to enforce it on a more casual grouping of players or conversely somebody actively breaking immersion in a situation where everyone else is trying to be immersed.In a nutshell someone ruining whatever atmosphere the group is collectively generating.  ,thedivision,cib4g43,2,t5_2xiqd
1308721,0,t1_cig8ew7,I wouldnt call it constructive criticism either. I would call it my opinion.And I stand by that opinion Even in the unrealistic realm of games it is possible to be more realistic. As mentioned Many games dont have the damage displayed over the head of the target or a blast radius for granades. These are not features inherent to games or RPGs. Again many features can be explained by the futuristic technology available in the world but some can not.The ting I did not mention I dont care wether The Division will be more or less realistic. This will not be the deciding factor for me on the qualitiy of the game. What I meant to say was If we try to guess on features we should do so from a reasonable basis. And assuming a feature will be included because the game is very realistic sets you up for uneeded disappontment in my opinion.,thedivision,ciguivi,1,t5_2xiqd

1714312,0,t3_2e1prd,Its an ubisoft game. They have a pretty naileddown formula. Im sure it will do a couple interesting things but heres the basicsIts a storyline campaign based game with a focus on online coop. It will be openworld built upon taking the city back presumably one areabase at a time.Lets look at your questions more directly. The game is about its pve campaign and story directly. However I would be shocked to my core if there was not a separate online pvp component. . If you have played an open world game in the last five years or so you already know the score. The story will be primarily linear but youll have opportunities to play one mission before the other or vice versa on occasion.

As an Xbone owner I went in knowing full well that it isnt as powerful as the PS. I bought it for games. That and the resolution gap between the two wont really make all that much of a difference. The real issue in my eyes is that Xbox AND Sony fans arent uniting and asking why they  such they were sold nextgen hardware when in actuality the hardware is no where near that. Both companies went the cheap route.  Back in my daylol companies would eat the cost of the console hardware so they could produce a very powerful console at a somewhat reasonable price.

4344320,0,t3_3arpz3,TEXT VERSION for those at workEDIT Be sure to go the original article when you have free internet access to give the interviewer his due creditinternet traffic. He did really well in his interview and deserves praise for properly representing the Destiny community.Background FactsTTK Launches in three packages... for digital edition which contains the new DLC and the Year  founders sparrow shader and emblem... for legendary editionwhich includes the original game both Year  DLCs and TTK DLC... for collectors edition which includes everything in the Legendary edition a bunch of different physical items and three exclusive emotes shaders and exp boosting class items.Fans are pissed because the only way to get the exclusive shaders and emotes is by repurchasing old content they already have.START INTERVIEWEurogamer So it may seem like a small thing but youre adding exclusive content to the game  three new dance emotes  that players cant get unless they rebuy the main game and the two existing DLCs. Is that right?Luke Smith There is no way right now for you to get the new dance emotes without doing that. Those are Collectors Edition exclusive. Weve set some stuff aside for that edition specifically to really make it appeal to fans who have engaged with the game already and also to people that will enter the game this autumn.Can you see that some fans are confused that youre asking them to buy stuff they already own?Yeah I can totally empathise with those people. But the Collectors Edition is a pretty cool package for people who want to pursue that stuff. Otherwise surely what youre saying is that you would want to buy them separately right?Well yeah. I would rather do that  pay a few pounds or dollars or whatever  than spend money on things I already own.Well we have nothing more to talk about regarding your opportunity to spend extra money in Destiny other than The Taken King and the three versions weve announced.Is Bungie considering selling customisation items such as this separately? Or is that against the studios philosophy for the game?Rather than comment on the Bungie philosophy heres what Ill tell you. If someone made a golf clap emote I would spend money on that. Like when someone falls in the Vault of Glass. At the moment I bow when Im trying to mess with them. So... I empathise with some of the things youre saying. I feel like you should put some of these things that you are empathising with into practice.We have nothing to announce today. Were reading the forums and the reactions to this weeks announcements. We will continue to discuss player feedback with respect to the the game and Collectors Edition content.Taken King costs . which is almost same as base game. Does its content justify that?Im going to use American dollars because British pounds are just foreign to me...Literally foreign.Indeed an ocean away. So purchasers get a big rich campaign. Fully voiced cinematics and the story of what happens when an angry alien god wages war on a solar system all with a satisfying conclusion. You also have a new subclass to pursue and unlock. We also have a bunch of new strikes  were not yet talking about how many  and a new raid. Were showing two new PVP modes and four PVP maps this week and its a fairly safe bet were not done yet showing things off. So Im fairly excited about the value proposition. Were calling this a major expansion because it is. Were giving people a whole new place to go that new destination...I get that it is big but it is also the same price as the base game. That had four areas rather than one and more missions than the Taken King. Why is it the same price?All I can do is answer that with the same thing I just gave you... Were really comfortable with the value were giving to players this autumn. I believe that once we begin to share more players will be even more excited. And for existing players it also comes with the Founders pack with a new Sparrow shader and emblem.Just not the emotes.It doesnt because they come with the Collectors Edition.Final question on prices Is it also the final question on the emotes?Im not going to mention them again. I cant get them.But you can if you buy the Collectors Edition.Im not going to buy the game and the two DLCs all over again.Ok but first I want to poke at you on this a little bit.Poke at me?Youre feeling anxious because you want this exclusive content but you dont know yet how much you want it. The notion of spending this money is making you anxious I can see it I do want them. I would buy them If I fired up a video right now and showed you the emotes you would throw money at the screen.What Im saying is that fan frustration is not because they dont understand the proposition. It comes regardless of how cool the exclusive content is. The frustration  and mine as a fan  is that the method of acquiring it requires me to rebuy content I bought a year ago.Long pause Its about value. The players assessment of the value of the content.Final question on prices  The Taken King and everything released so far comes at a significant price reduction for people who want to jump in to Destiny this September. All games do Game of the Year editions now  I understand that thats not really an issue. But when you look at the reduction involved  its barely any more than just buying The Taken King solo.This autumn we want to have a moment of convergence where players like you and me who are engaged with Destiny can match up with people who are just joining in who didnt pick the game up last year for one reason or another.Its also important to remember the temporal valuation of content. If you played during The Dark Below you were playing when there were Swordbearers everywhere. Thats now gone and you cant recapture that now. Some things are being left behind as we move forward. Its the same with House of Wolves right now with the Fallen showing up all over the solar system. Those things are going to be less relevant as we move forward and the Taken are everywhere.We dont have a way to go back in time and experience those things again. So the players who were there can say I was here when... and I did it when it was new.I wish I had a way of better telling players that I was there back then. That I had a better way of embracing the legacy of my time with the game. This is something that we on the development team talk about all the time. Its really important that we figure out ways to embrace the legacy that players created in the first year... Im not going to talk about how were going to do that but it is right in the forefront of our brains.

When you climb up the last wall you automaticly jump into the zone and when you reboot your UI your are basicly already transfering into the PVP server.... since you have to be online all the time there should no prob with joining another player bulb If you have a longer loading time i guess it will be just a slower reboot time of your UI,thedivision,csfp1pt,2,t5_2xiqd
4349409,0,t3_3aqhdu,To me this looks much better than the first playthrough. It is the same zone but if Im not mistaken the entry point is different?My conclusion is this  this is a very experimental build. They obviously created a single playable instance just for showcase at E. Its stupid to expect that each DZ will have one set of enemies stopping you from legendary loot and you can finish the game in  minutes. It will mosdef last much much longer have more variety. This is just a showcase build.,thedivision,csfwsfm,1,t5_2xiqd
4351552,0,t1_csg4ua1,So in my experience with preorders A lot of places will tell you to use twoday shipping the Ubistore for example to ensure the package arrives on the day the game is released. This means that copies do ship early in order to arrive on time.I am not sure about upgrading from one edition to the next. I havent read anything about that thus far. That might be a question a rep from Ubisoft could answer however right now I suspect they might tell you to cancel your standard edition and order the gold edition. ,thedivision,csg5hvo,1,t5_2xiqd

One thing that I think you hit on is crouch which it seems a lot of people especially what I see on reddit want but the fact is it wouldnt work well with the cover system implemented since you basically already have crouch in the form of crouching behind cover.Also this game is more a rd Person RPG than Shooter meaning shot kills takedowns and other features that you may find in other shooter just wouldnt work.,thedivision,cxyjmwj,7,t5_2xiqd

The Division is going to be fewer enemies with more shots.

The experience of playing against some of the bullet sponges in that game has probably prepared me for The Division in some way.I definitely have seen some terrible shooting in gameplay footage that makes it seem like TTK is too long but in the last few days have seen vids of people taking out low level enemies as quickly as Id expect.  Up until now Ive felt the TTK appeared to be a tad too long. I guess Ill wait to play myself before deciding.As for the salt Im pretty used to seeing an otherwise good community trip over itself to rip apart a game so Im not all that surprised to see it here.

If you preordered through uPlay but she got a code like I did that could cause the difference. Youre key was more automatic due to uPlay being your source but heres less so.

Me   PM Hi     Me   PM I got a beta code for The Division through NVIDIAs promotion and when I try redeeming the code that was sent to me it says its not valid     Me   PM I tried getting another code from NVIDIA but the promotion has ended     Me   PM Is there anything I can do to get the code I have to work?     Sean S   PM I went ahead and checked the code it appears it was already activated on another account.  Another issue with that particular access key is that it is European and would not have worked in any case    Unfortunately we would need this request to come account that the key was originally tied to.     Me   PM This key right?     Sean S   PM Yep that is the exact key     Me   PM I tried activating it as soon as I got it. Thats very strange that it was activated on another account     Me   PM Am I out of luck then since the promotion has ended?     Sean S   PM It is definitely strange.  It is not the first I have heard of this today however.  If I were to guess I would say Nvidia sent out a batch of keys twice but thats just my guess and not anything that we know of   Unfortunately with a promotion of this nature since there is no proof of purchase with a key on it there is no way to verify except through nvidia     Me   PM I already contacted nvidia and they said try getting another code. When I did the promotion already ended.     Me   PM I appreciate the information Sean S.      Sean S   PM I apologize    Hopefully better luck next time!     Me   PM Thanks again. Goodbye     Sean S   PM Have a good afternoon ,thedivision,czfqwjr,4,t5_2xiqd

6396035,0,t1_czgmokq,I understand your frustration and this came up several times in the official forum during the alpha.

When the chopper arrived we were attacked by two rogue we defended ourself and cornered them i was about to finish one off from like m away when some non rogue douchebag ran straight into my line of fire. Unfortunately i didnt record it but i must have hit him with  bullets i immediately got a ish s timer whereupon all the other  people almost immediately turned their guns at me and shot me down and striplooted all the good stuff.the moral lesson is. people wont give a flying fart if there is an obvious friendly fire countdown. you are rogue? you are dead. they dont make a distinction between  hits roguetimer s and active participation you yourself or one in your squad in killing an agent  s timer amp rank  rogue. if you extend on that this will get even worse in dense areas.i totally see your point but tbh...this was debated in the alpha already and I have yet to see a sweetspot solution to that...one way or another it will be exploited for your mentioned reasons.,thedivision,czhfvru,2,t5_2xiqd

The game looks good and I think it really feels like shit went down in New York when you play the game. But Im not gonna buy a game that I will play for two  three weeks and then get bored of. So will I buy The Division the day its released? Nope. I will wait until I know for sure that there is end game conten enough to keep me entertained for a long period of time. If this is another game that I will be playing a lot right after release then forget about until a DLC is launched that will keep me entertained for another hour then this isnt a game for me. If this game cant give me at least    weeks of action and entertainment then Im not getting it.

So many times I have been assaulting a group of rogues and some superhero goes sprinting in and gets hit by one of my nades or bullets. All of sudden Im rogue and the people I have been helping this whole time even picking them up suddenly turn on me even though its obviously a mistake. I get gunned down and lose a lot of money and rank. Horseshit.There should be some sort of scale. You help people outkill other rogues  increase in your cool guy rank. If you accidentally kill somebody then you lose a chunk of your cool guy rank. Lose enough of that and you fall into Rogue status. Once you die or outlast the timer you are reset into Neutral. From Neutral you can instantly jump into Rogue status just by shooting other people.

6413138,0,t3_43ier9,It sounds like you are expecting regular updates during the three day beta which isnt going to happen I was surprised they fixed a couple of the exploits that were found.Give them a chance to make the changes before you start slamming them for things they still have a month before it comes out and at this stage a lot can be done in a month because all the ground work has already been done. If you are unsure how it will be at launch then wait a bit keep an eye on it and check the updates they release. Then whenif you are happy with it buy it. The best way to show them things are good or not is leaving feedback on the forums regardless of post count if the content is valid detailed and well put together then it will be taken into account and by voting with your money.This is Ubisoft so they may or may not do anything but this is certainly looking like a better game than some of their previous releases in terms of quality and playability.,thedivision,czilxk8,1,t5_2xiqd

Yes definitely. Its not the same as Destiny at all other than its on onlinebased game that involves shooting. Is there enough to keep you interested for  hours like Destiny?

6413485,0,t1_czimw3f,Well it takes  seconds to load into the game. And that is not taking into account the logging in at Uplay or the logging in when booting it up. Thats the time from menu to ingame. gt Because your SSD controls how fast their servers sync you up with the game world?No but they arent loading anything or synching it either when I log into the game. The network usage only spikes up hard when I start the game and it shows me Loggin in XXUSERNAMEXXafter that the network usage is almost non existant. Only thing that goes up is the SSD and other hardware when I boot it up thats what takes  seconds. On an SSD thats quite high.gtThose other games also have loading screens in gameYep and they are lt seconds on an SSD. While in Divison when you fast travel it can take quite a lot of time to do so. Making it sometimes almost useless.Divison has some major loading problems that need to be fixed. I run it on SSD I can not imagine the loading times on HDD or even consoles those must be multiple minutes.gt This game doesnt even load when you start a mission like the one we have on offer now.Which one are you talking about?Back  topic I also complained about a lot of other things ingame that simply waste your time for no good reason. The masked loading screen when entering your base is just ridicolous when you think of the long loading time when booting the game up the first time. They did not even load the base as well?Other than that my other points still apply all this waiting and unnecessary running around makes this game a chore sometimes. You found some awesome loot? Some weapons and mods? Well have fun walking in and outside your base multiple times to test and try different attchements and put things in your stash and taking them out.

Im actually kind of glad thats not a feature here in The Division because honestly I like having some Rogues running around.It would be nice to see some antigrief type mechanisms in The Division though one of which being a more advanced spawning system where players cant just graveyard Rush you to keep resetting a timer aimlessly. Something akin to Runescape where if you died in the Wilderness you had to make a decent trek back to the Wilderness.IE  If you are a Rogue and have no DZ credits to spill on death it should extend you respawn timer significantly. If you are a nonRogue and you are killed you should be placed in the spawn point farthest from the Rogue.,thedivision,czk7w04,1,t5_2xiqd

6432521,0,t3_43s0rw,Great post thanks for sharing. Flip the manhunt timer to grow upwards instead of countdown. Make every  minutes of surviving a manhunt trigger reward. If level  rogue count down finishes the manhunt is called off. Currently almost impossible to survive the manhunt. I really loves this idea s might need to be tweaked ie. Survive a manhunt for  mins etc.Along with the issue of permasprinting which would probably make this too easy to maintain Have players drop some ammo if killed by an opposing player. Resupply packs in the beta DZ are too scarce to stay in the fight. Especially troublesome as a rogue agent.And this just seems reasonable. If this isnt the solution then put ammo inside the buildingsservice stationsetc far more regularly.,thedivision,czknsuy,2,t5_2xiqd

6436948,0,t3_43ux7z,gtPlayer interaction? Nothing meaningful. You could see players out in the world and at the tower but there was no real way to communicate without adding them to a party chat or going through the cumbersome messaging system. And even then they likely didnt respond. You only had matchmaking for basic pvp and a handful of activities strike playlists and PoE. There was no in game method for setting up parties to tackle raids or NF. Bungie even advocated using third party sites for that which was way more effort than I generally wanted to put in.One thing Id like to add  Destiny lacks meaninful tools for grouping up with your own friends.In The Division you can literally see where your friends are on the map at all times and pick them to send an invite at any moment either the option to join them was missing or I didnt notice it.In Destiny there is for some very weird reason a feature for showing X friends playing on any given activity but you cant actually join or invite friends through it! No you have to go through the roster just like normally... and you have to separately load up the information of every single player to find out who on your friends list is playing that activity.The system makes just... no sense. It cant be explained. Theres no possible actual sensible explanation that can exist in this universe to somehow explain what is going on with Destiny there.And this is where The Division shines with its easily accessible matchmaking easily accessible friend inviting being able to see a live location of your friends and actually know who they are youd think this is obvious but see DestinyampnbspOh and lets not even talk about all the awesome clan features inside Destiny... how do you talk about that which does not exist?

Just... No. You should have to escape to get rid of your rogue status. I think that rogues shouldnt show on everyones map unless someone actually spots them.

6473559,0,t1_czovwti,I like the DZ but if you want to focus on actual pvp than one in two things happended.You are either shot in the back or running unless youre in a good group. The rogue system has some mechanics that kinda pushes the player into either a constant marathon or troll kills.I loved the random fire fights and events but i found the general pvp really boring as the rogue timers and bullet spongy mechanics made the game into a marathon simulator more than a pop zone. No mobs in there either so... Mainly frustration and boredom was what i wasted my time on in the DZ.But what content? This game is almost done and we saw NOTHING in the beta this either tells me that they are hiding most and focused on giving us a demo or that there just isnt much content OR that they will hide much content behind paywalls.Ive heard we are getting  missions? Lol? Like the hospital one? That seems laughable.We saw like three kinds of mobs? All boringly similair in visual presentation. Its like if World of warcraft only had boars Wolf and murlocks. We sure surely getting more but im seriously worried that this game will be a grind simulator re killing the same boring hoodlums over and over which i felt totally out of place btw.About gear well we are looking for kneecaps and bulletproofvests... This could easily get boring fast i didnt feel the loot was interesting. I also hated the character design and visuals i dont want to look like a hobo in Windbreaker and hoodie i want to look badass... I know this is very subjective but im worried i will look like a nerd in cargo pants and beanie for a long time.I know they specificslly mentioned microtransactions so im not so worried about that but putting content behind paywalls seems very likely right now.,thedivision,czowtxb,-2,t5_2xiqd

6477715,0,t3_44d4hx, You can strictly group with your friends and take on all the PvE content with your friends alone. Matchmaking for missions is optional you can simply ignore it and enter with whatever group of friends you have. Harder content will likely need a full group of agents such as challenge modes Of which the devs have said theyve seen no one be able to complete a single Challenge mission alone. The Dark Zone is a bit hard to comment on because of how different your experiences in there will be. Generally speaking you go into Dark Zones to seek higher quality loot through drops or vendors You need DZ credits to buy these loots from vendors and this requires you to kill DZ NPCs for money or engage in the Rogue system by killing Rogue agents or going Rogue yourself.Right now we dont know how important the devs will make the Dark Zone in the late game.

The key to a good game is whether the journey to the loot is fun. From the beta experience the people running around with the Orange guns from the safe house vender werent automatically more powered.

6494356,0,t3_44ltvb,Well have to see the extent of how that plays out. I remember in Destiny everyone thought Titans were the default tanks Warlocks were the DPS and Hunters were the AgilityBuff classes. Destiny also has stat trees that SLIGHTLY skew health movement and skills one way or another but never enough to have a huge advantage...Its really tough to know fro the Beta is all Im saying. The three categories armor boosts give you could make a massive difference at the end game for stats like HP DPS and skill recharge or your character level BoO progression. Perks and talents could be where players draw most of their power.I dont think The Division will be anything like Destiny however. Im merely being realistic in waiting to see the difference between builds at the end game.If someone with all HP armor can truly tank the shit out of an end game instance for the other  in their group then I can imagine were all going to be holding on to multiple armor items for each of the three stat boosts we can switch to when teaming up before an instance.So to answer your question maybe the gear people have on them will make a bigger difference on group makeup and if thats the case we can probably expect a decent number of stubborn assholes insisting they didnt bring their tanking gear and have to go full DPS or be booted from the group... Thats my theory.,thedivision,czr2c1e,1,t5_2xiqd

6497527,0,t1_czrdewe,Ive seen the Forbes article before. Im actually kind of sick of seeing it just because Ive seen it so much. What the article shows is that overall pc gaming revenue is larger than console but theres a couple of problems with that.First of all the article brags that theres  million gaming pcs worldwide and then it goes on to brag that pc gaming revenue has just now surpassed console gaming revenue. You see the problem with that.If theres that many gaming pcs out there and the revenue has only just now matched console gaming that means that each pc gamer is contributing a much smaller portion of revenue. According to the article theres supposedly around  times as many pc gamers. That means each pc gamer is worth only a third as much as a single console gamer.Second since AAA games always sell less copies on pc even after steam sales in most cases we have to ask ourselves where that revenue is coming from. The apparent answer can be found in the article the top games are ones like Dota  LoL and CSGO just like you said. And where does most of the revenue from those games come from? Microtransactions.So the nut of that article is that theres a lot of pc gamers and the best way to monetize them is fp with microtransactions. Going back to our original conversation starter what would you take away from that if you were a AAA game developer making...oh...say the next Tomb Raider? Would you spend a huge amount of time and resources on a port going to a platform that historically has only made up a fraction of your sales that historically will only buy the game after its gone on sale for half price that historically may pirate your game before they feel like paying for it at a ridiculously low price that historically tends to complain if their edition doesnt look better than the console players that are actually your meat and potatoes?,thedivision,czre5br,3,t5_2xiqd

6507485,0,t3_44ohtq,First no it wouldnt be wrong to kill someone even after their timer has stopped to get your stuff back. Just keep in mind it will cause you to go rogue then. Second but actually the primary issue is that this is why this is broken. This is not a fun way to PVP..for anyone. PVP should cause people to stand and fight not run away. Right now the rogues only recourse is to run. You shoot and hit someone you timer resets you kill someone your counter goes up and resets. Its an endless loop you can never get out of unless you run and hide somewhere and even that isnt effective because once your rogue you light up on everyones maps. Well thats not PVP...that hidingrunning. Thats not fun for anyone. The problem is though I cant think of a better way to do it and have it be fair for everyone. I still feel like the counter should be damage based and actually go down not up depending on your kills. ExampleYou go rogue instead of the  or  second timer you get say  minutes for L. So that counts down but if you shoot people seconds can drop off kills even more time drops off. But kills will raises your counter..all the way to  manhunt again. And thats the part I cant think of changing. Obviously for killing you may get more time..but again counterproductive. So I dont really know how they could handle the rogue levels. ,thedivision,czsf8yo,1,t5_2xiqd

6509422,0,t3_44sv3i,Just because its a high end weapon doesnt necessarily make it better than a rare weapon.  Sometimes the talents of the weapons make it a high end weapon as well as a higher DPS but you have to consider other variables.  For example in the BETA the Cassidy sucks my opinion.  It was a high end shotgun that you could purchase in the DZ.  I easily chose to keep my purple SASG even though the Cassidy did more DPS.  Cassidy was a  shot shot gun which equates into super slow RoF.  My SASG had  shells before I had to reload.  The RoF of my SASG over the Cassidy more than made up for the higher DPS of Cassidy.  In general the higher end weapons should be better but its not always the case.,thedivision,czsmh65,2,t5_2xiqd

You havent been paying attention... that would be the equivalent of professional suicide.Regardless here is a quick source that shows there is no correlation between gun ownership and gun violenceNotice how the states with the lowest gun violence in the nation  regardless of gun ownership rates are all states that rank amongst the highest white populations in the nation and many of them arent exactly the posh uppermiddle America MassachusettsVermont.Now go look up which cities have the highest gun violence in America.  Youll find that cities like DC Chicago New Orleans Baltimore Memphis NYC Oakland LA St Louis Cleveland and Detroit will rank extremely high.  Now look at their racial distributions you really shouldnt have to you know the answer.Now compare those cities to cities that are have significantly lower black population... ie San Diego Minneapolis Phoenix Austin Seattle Portland.  Feel like those cities are not representative of conservative white gun owning America?  Then by all means try poor white cornbread gun ownership capitals of the world like Des Moise Salt Lake City Omaha Cheyanne Boise amp Billings.

You will still be able to organise a group of friends and do the raid with them. People worried about bad PuG experiences will have the option of avoiding those experiences completely.Adding matchmaking however introduces a way for those people not interested in rd party sites The majority a way to experience this content and meet other people.That experience may not always be painless but the other option is just having a huge number of people not do your raids.

Yeah they obviously have differences but theyre still the same form of mission they arent Side missions or encounters theyre story missions that are repeatable have a selectable difficulty and can be FTd too...all  fall in the same boat especially since based off what weve seen it only takes the first wing mission to open up upgrade options after that encounters or anything that brings supplies can lead to upgrades and you can choose to tackle upgrades in whatever order...meaning most MedicalTechSecurity Main missions are actually more about learning about the outbreak Medical improving your defenses and the JTF forces Security and improving your techreachcommunication we Tech until all those are well established and joined in towards whatever the end goal is.If the Developers come out and say Theres  Maim missions or Theres  story missions theyre talking all  categories of main missions and thinking like you would just lead to confusion.My main point is when THEY talk about the game they consider all  the same thing storymain missions so when they make statements my way of putting it is a better way to think then yours. notice they arent listed Main  mission its  Main Mission so they are in fact main missions...like how the genre is listed Online OpenWorld RPG the RPG is the main component Big soft chocolate doughnut ltits mainly a doughnut.Its pretty much semantics at this point but theres simply no need to separate Main Missions from  Main Missions as theyre fundamentally the same thing.,thedivision,czyfdw4,2,t5_2xiqd

Shortly before I played the closed beta on PC I thought maybe Ill play it there. After playing the closed beta this game alone has made the PC worth it for me. I dont mean to hype it up much but it was so much fun. The community was normally pretty nice too. I ran into a dick that would shoot me and try to get me to go rogue so I eventually ran away. Warned some people to watch out for him and in return they watched my back while I was extracting loot. Not every is so nice but thats ok. It adds to the fun. Also the beauty of this game surprised me and really made me feel like I was there in NY.

Beyond that there are some added incentives with extra cosmetics only awarded to Gold Edition. Currently the Season Pass hasnt really hit retailers yet but Gamestop is advertising it at .. If that price holds the Gold Edition wont really save any money.

When you dont have CoD like TTK and RPG mechanics are involved those  no scope skills are less useful.Sure mampkb is superior but Im looking forward to checking out gyro aiming for the open beta.Another benefit to seamless mouse and controller support is the Steam Controller which works best when you can use analogue movement with mouse aim. Ive tried out gyro aiming in CSGO and it actually works really well. Still need to test out the Steam Controller. But seriously I thought Id get wrecked using a controller in the DZ and it just wasnt the case.

6634431,0,t3_46j29y,Get a MA marksman rifle for distance shooting and an AK assault rifle for closer work.  Never go full auto with the AK unless its point blank and youre desperate.  The damage per bullet is high on the AK so make them count.  Aim for headshots in  round bursts from the AK.. always aim for the head with the MA.  Magazine mods with magazine capacity is always nice.You can pretty much IGNORE the DPS stat on the weapons.  I dont agree with their formula AT ALL.  The base damage per bullet is the most important but then factor in magazine size and headshot damage  critical hit modifiers.  Since youre aiming your shots and not going full auto rate of fire doesnt really matter and thats a big factor in the games DPS calculation.  Thats why you can ignore it.Always use cover!  Pop out land some headshots and pop back behind it before the first  of your health is gone.  Wait to regen it back to  and repeat.If you get a weapon that heals you on critical hits or kills thats a very nice plus since it can put you over the  bar threshold of health to regen another  health.Get a good mix of stamina firepower and armor on all your gear.Dont do the main mission first.  Get all the missions from the harbor JTF woman and the mission board before you leave the Hudson piers camp.Use the heal skill.  The shield isnt worth it for a new player.  Pulse is nice to help you get used to where enemies spawn  Sticky bomb is fun but not necessary.  Pulse  Heal skill is my favorite combo.. though I havent tried the turret yet.Pick up everything you can.. sell everything youre not using.Finally.. play through all the missions solo so you can go at your pace the first time but also NOT miss anything!  Theyre all relatively easy on solo especially if youre keeping stamina gear and using medkits when needed.,thedivision,d05k2rd,15,t5_2xiqd

6660304,0,t1_d0889hw,Its in line with the lore.  In fact what youre asking for is to cripple the lore to salve your own risk aversion.The guy in the helicopter is just some JTF nobody.  He doesnt know who is at the bottom of that rope and he doesnt care hes just going to burn out and drop it off.  Furthermore the mere fact that the game can even highlight rogue agents at all is at odds with the lore since the game explicitly tells you over and over again that they do not have network coverage of the Dark Zone and that the full first wave of the Division itself could not hold onto that area.  You arent interested in the lore.  Thats just your dishonest smokescreen to try and shoehorn in a nerf to something that is already too weak.,thedivision,d088dxu,1,t5_2xiqd

6662660,0,t1_d0855xm,They increased prices and lowered drops a little bit to balance it. It takes a good few hours to get enough to buy the weapons at k now which is more than fine but its also not the end game gear which in a lot of games tends to be exponentially more than what you get at lower levels. Other games also suffer from problems such as gear purchases being so expensive below max level that you may as well never touch them because drops will be your best bet  of the time since you outgrow it so much faster. Just that is a difficult thing to balance and we dont know if the dz is gonna have a vendor at the safehouse just to throw weapons at us like that or anything in the full game since it very well could be done as a taste of the high life in the beta.,thedivision,d08h5lt,1,t5_2xiqd

6669102,0,t3_46y18e,I played this weeks beta extensively and about the roque issue ive noticed the following Spawning is fast. I know it takes  secs for a roque to spawn but if a group of roques are well covered we all know the covering spaces by know the dead teammate will respawn with no rogue status travel to the battle site kill one unaware agent that was engaging the rogues become rogue and continue the fight. as mentioned above rogue agent that dies looses the rogue effect at respawn.Solution that shoulld be implimented bigger respawn wait period for roque agents and not loosing rogue status after dying unless the whole team is rogue status free or put a status effect mentioning that his fireteam are rogue so unaware people should know if there is a possible wolf in sheeps clothing. this happpent to me a couple times but fortunately i noticed a strange behavior on the players prior trying to attempt to regain his rogue status by killing me in the mist of battle.Lastly my major concern is the fireteam is limited to  person so a four person rogue team is hard enough to deal with somehow fun as i noticed but what if there are a   fireteams of people going rogue at the same time or more teams and what if those fireteams where in the same clan and on group chat cocoordinating. the server would be a war zone that forcing ppl to quit playing the game.

There were ways to get decent gear before entering the DZ did you get to lvl  and not get blues from Madison and not start buying blue gear from the vendors? You probably did what my gf did. For me  hours after reaching lvl  I had already replaced most of my green equipment with blues. The first things I bought with dz funds were better attachments for my guns they were the cheapest and can be transferred.By scale do you mean that if we are both lvl  and you just got into the dark zone we shouldnt be able to play together because I have blue gear and you have green gear? So more segmentation of players? Should the mobs be easier for you as well because you lack in gear?I dont understand what you mean too general.,thedivision,d09z88t,0,t5_2xiqd

Thats why you always try to get a group so that you have backup and people will be less likely to target you.  If all else fails you can always try to hunt them down for revenge.

6690354,0,t1_d0bbnf9,So the only difference between an online rpg and an MMORPG is the MMO part?  And yet you say there isnt much difference between an online rpg and an MMO.  So would you also call games like Diablo not much different than an MMO?  Its also an Online RPG.  MMO means MASSIVE multiplayer so the only difference is a few hundred players on screen at the same time if not more?  Seems like quite a big difference to me.  But maybe Im oldschool when thinking MMO is its own actual genre.  And maybe Im still oldschool when thinking an RPG doesnt HAVE to have endgame and that if you arent having fun playing the game at any other moment then you probably shouldnt be playing.People spent  hours combined in the closedopen beta of TD pretty sure they are happy with where its at.  But you and many others keep making these doom and gloom posts about how TD wont get any better or have any additional content which is clearly false since weve only seen a small bit of the content and basically no story no crafting only a small portion of the abilities not even all the skill branches etc and nobody has seen any gameplay outside of level  through  aside from a few very controlled youtube demos.But yes please continue to tell us how we should be worried about TD not having more content. ,thedivision,d0bcap9,4,t5_2xiqd

6691288,0,t3_47714e,Im one of the ones who would fit into the MMO player niche and heres my centsAny game with any kind of progression in this case an RPG has to design their game around the END GAME. You design the end game first then build everything else around it. The leveling process from X x being the max level is simply a transitory phase. The game does not begin until you are maxed level. It is when you have everything at your disposal that you can then begin to figure out the meta of the game. This holds true for traditional MMOs. This even holds true for games like League of Legends where youre not truly playing the game at a high level until you are maxed and have access to all your skills runes etc. Some of you might say what about Mass Effect? That game plays fine without being maxed level! but I digress your characters progress is irrelevant in a storydriven game. The Division is not this.Without knowing whats in store for players once they reach level  preordering this game is simply not a wise bet. Ubisoft should have marketed whats waiting for players at the end of their level grind to entice players to play this game invest in it and keep playing and paying for content.,thedivision,d0bfru8,1,t5_2xiqd

Is their vision everyone at max level just repeating the missions they did to get there on harder modes? Or do they want us all the be in the DZ? So far from what I have seen that is the only conclusion we can draw unless we are told otherwise. While those may be perfect for a lot of people picking up the game for others that just is not appealing. Some of us are hoping there are new missions and group content that opens up at max level. Thats fairly standard for MMOs but we cant assume that will happen with this game. We are not asking for exact scripts and storyboards just let us know there is more to look forward to.

6701627,0,t3_47f9hv,Fucking dense. End game content isnt about how fucking long youll play a game as in the literal hour count or your individual fucking perception of value hours of entertainment vs dollar etcEnd game content is about things to do after youve beaten the main storyline. Some games dont have end game content and just drop you back in Velen or Harran or the Geothermal Valley where nothing feels different and youll do a lot of the same shit you were already doing except with this distantcreeping feeling of aimlessness. And thats fine because you had a motherfucking blast of an adventure up until then and you can usually expect some form of DLC that throws you back into the fray Some games DO have end game content because thats what the devs think they should add. Massive is one of these developers that saw it fit to have The Division feature end game content.Why? Because it makes fucking sense! Every dev wants you to play their game. Some may even want you to play it TWICE! or THRICE! Some very nefarious s devs want you to play their game or games til the end of fucking time hello Blizzard! So these devs what they do is they dangle something super desirable in front of players like a carrot on a stick and these players either unknowingly or begrudgingly follow. Its usually trying to reach TOP gear possible in the game. Im talking apex of the best of the best. Playing in a mode that a majority of players arent in. You know that feeling when you look at your Trophies and it says only lt of people have this ITS THAT FEELING DEVS WANT YOU TO TAP INTO WHILE PLAYING THEIR GAME. Yay! The feeling of being eliteleetlt!In Destiny its hitting  light level. In Diablo its Torment  and ladder standings. In The Division its being an unstoppable fucking war machine in the DZ and for end game missions!End game content is a label you put on stuff that is created and tailored specifically for people who have beaten almost everything else in the game and want the challenge or have the drive to keep playing anyways because gluttony.

Relying on players to fix an imbalance isnt a good design decision.A low level player might not have access to a different spawn location and therefor would not have access to the Dark Zone without switching servers.  Also not a good design decision.Nearly everyone in the Dark Zone during the beta was level  even when the rogues were using high level gear the nonhostile players were still on fairly even ground.  I would argue that this is why you were able to have fun taking on people with better gear because you still had a chance.A level  player wont have a chance of killing a group of level  players with high level gear and a group of  rogues would take up a decent chunk of the server population.  Even if you somehow got all  other players in the session assuming its a full session to work together and try to kill the rogues they may not be able to do it and the rogues can always respawn and go right back to killing.,thedivision,d0eeedy,2,t5_2xiqd

6722601,0,t3_47kc1c,They need to redo the DPS statistic altogether. Right now its just a mishmash of every stat thrown into the weapon. Somehow accuracy and hipfire accuracy actually count towards the weapons DPS statistic. How dps is seemingly calculated is every bullet is hitting every bullet is hitting the head the damage the reload speed the RPM of the weapon the magazine capacity and then completely random variables like accuracy hipfire accuracy and critical damage are thrown in. Then your firearm skill stat also affects DPS.I really think that weapon DPS should just be calculated like this Damage Magazine size RPM Reload time Armor penetration Firearms skill and that is it. With probably a different metric for shotguns. Everything else is a completely random variable that its up to the player to figure out. Because right now its a noobtrap.For instance in the beta I found a level  blue RPK that the game said had less DPS than my starter M. The RPK did  more damage per shot and when I killed an enemy theyd speed up my skill regeneration timers but because the game was calculating all these superfluous stats it said the RPK was less DPS. Sure if I was shooting a boss in the head for  minutes straight with perfect accuracy the M might do more dps but in reality for most of the content the blue RPK was the obviously superior gun.,thedivision,d0eob49,1,t5_2xiqd

Surely could dig up more examples if I was bothered enough.You talk about drawing the line and about it being subjective.Thats exactly why this works  Ubisoft calls them DLC instead of Microtransactions because microtransactions have a very clear and obvious stigma on them and neither of these terms have any sort of  universal textbook definition.It DOES NOT MATTER whether you agree with me that they are microtransactions or not.

Already gave plenty of money to good guy Microsoft.Edit also I really want to see more of games being sold dual platform like the case with the offer on preordering Quantum Break. Perhaps Sony could work a deal out with Steam? gt PreOrder Quantum Break for Xbox One to Receive the Windows  Version at No Additional CostXbox wants to empower gamers to play the games they want with the people they want on the devices they want so Microsoft Studios and Remedy Entertainment will launch Quantum Break on Windows  simultaneously with the Xbox One version on April  . Anyone who preorders the Xbox One digital version of Quantum Break through the Xbox Store purchases an Xbox One digital token at participating retailers or preorders an Xbox One Special Edition Quantum Break bundle will receive the Windows  version of the game downloadable at the Windows Store via redemption code.,thedivision,d0hg108,2,t5_2xiqd

My only rule to the folks who squad up with me is to not initiate engagements with other players while in the dark zone. No matter how you look at it there is way too much risk vs reward. Dont get me wrong. If you get engaged by another player and then he goes rogue  we wipe him off the map. Basically selfdefense or keep your hands to yourself. But if you take us rogue on purpose then I wish you luck in finding a new squad because it sucks to lose RankKeysDZ credits because you cant be prudent and foresee potential consequences for your actions. ,thedivision,d0i27pq,7,t5_2xiqd

6770854,0,t3_48iayn,i didnt get any beta invite or even an open beta to try out overwatch despite owning a lot of their games bought in my battlenet account. yes i did remember to flag interest in participating in the beta.... so as i hadnt touched a fps since counter strike and mw ages ago i wasnt really inclined to just buy a fps without trying it first.only the division gave me that opportunity to try it before buying in the open beta. so i ended up ordering gold edition. in that sense overwatch missed out on a similar opportunity to gain players by letting them try it first before purchase.anyway its a different type of game to division which has a loot rpg aspect also because its a tom clancy title its more grounded in real life rather than too sci fi even the story is based on an actual scenario   as well as using real life weapons albeit mechanics life spongy health effect detracted from realism in order to make room for gaming mechanics for a loot third party shooter to be fun. otherwise what then would be the point of gearing up if all weapons were  shot kills to the head? . overwatch from the youtube looked too fast paced like quake which is not to my taste. maybe had i tried it i would have thought differently but i never got the chance....,thedivision,d0jra31,4,t5_2xiqd

6773040,0,t1_d0jzgm7,I figured that would change. I hope it isnt too RNG crazy thats going to introduce a whole lot of other problem and you can still get some of the better items from vendorschests this way it allows people who want to play it safe and grind out DK the chance to get decent items as well but one thing I would love is for your bag to maybe change color depending on what you have in it.In the beta it was just a yellow bag with a toxic waste symbol that signified you were carrying an item green or blue it didnt matter. It would probably create a lot of tense situations if the bag color would change depending on what you had. If suddenly you kill a really tough mob and he drops an orange or a purple your bagtoxic waste symbol would change accordingly letting everyone around you know you were carrying something good. This would likely force more cooperation and cause some tense momentsbackstabbing. On the other side I can see the appeal of leaving it unknown. As I said before however the way it is currently seems like a good balance. It punishes rogue players pretty well the risk  reward is tipped in favor of playing nice. If it was any more punishing there would be too much of a risk to make it fun. Maybe my experience was rare but I only encountered one or two groups every once and awhile that were griefing killing for fun and they were easy to avoid. As it stands randomly killing people by yourself yields nothing other than putting a giant target on your head which is fun in its own right when you want it P,thedivision,d0k08qf,2,t5_2xiqd

6785169,0,t1_d0lbay6,Not everyone has listened to all the pod casts and interviews like you there is no information on their main page that indicates the companion app thats on their main page.  People see that media and make a purchase.  There is a trailer video on the website not just google which gives the impression that you too can fly this drone That person than feels deceived.  Its why you still see posts about the companion app by people who dont frequent the reddit.  Now imagine all the people who only saw that media on their website and have no idea that reddit exists..  Believe it or not some gamers dont even know IGNS a thing let alone the bowels of the internet known as reddit. A graphical demo which is obviously a demo and to the initiated is just there to generate hype.  However to the uninitiated it appears deceptive.Shown full maps of a much larger game space but come release the map is much smaller.  Another trailer that is still on the website.Responses like for end game content we have the dark zone and challenge modes then when asked about raids we are unable to talk about that.  Mind you could go either way raids or no raids.  If no raids could be seen as deceptive dodging the question with the intention of not hurting the bottom line.They can all have the appearance and perception to be deceptive depending on several factors just like they can have the appearance of being bad communication or just marketing or whatever.  This is the take home.  It doesnt matter that YOU know its an orphaned page not EVERYONE who uses google for that top hit will know.  People will see that as deceptive.  Its not far fetched to see why.The number one rule of being a consumer is buyer beware lol.  This rule is in place because businesses number one purpose is to separate your money from your wallet.  People are naturally wary of companies and to not be is actually irrational.  Its the total purpose of marketing.The point Im discussing is deception towards consumers in this case ubi and the division.  I also didnt make a sweeping generalization about your opinions I said this reddit does not seem to see past its front door they only seem to see a postive answer or excuse and all other people are trolls etc etc.  I do however think that there is a good chance you are really big fan boy and I have sterotyped you into this role.The point you are discussing is how I offended you or perhaps how I offended something you love. I used sarcasm to illustrate a point and you felt this is something I shouldnt do.  You took it to heart so I tried to make it more light in the next message.

6794706,0,t1_d0m3c2t,gt The game isnt meant to be realistic is not a statement I agree with. They went to great lengths to point out in the media what a realistic depiction of New York they created and how realistic the guns are and even released a video showing how hard Red Storm has been working on realistic guns. Tom Clancy label also is associated with high degree of realism. I think youre confusing a realistic setting with wanting the game to be realistic mechanically. Youre taking realism in the setting and a realistic representation and applying it to things that break the scope of the game. Do the guns kill in a realistic number of shots? Not exactly? A shot to the face from an M is going to kill someone realism itself goes out the window as an argument for the basis of everything. If shots dont kill like that then why is not having needs suddenly considered unrealistic? Its not meant to be realistic like that.

6798093,0,t1_d0mtddt,Because good anti cheats are so hard to come by. BattleEye goes as far as instilling a root kit onto your computer and people still hack the shit out of DAYZ and ARMA.  The only way to TRULY protect this game is to make EVERY single data value checked server side which would be next to impossible not only in the time frame between beta and release but in general due to the amount of power that it would require. Millions of users all getting everything checked all at once I dont think so. There was an instruction address which was static upon restart that gave the game commands to change weapon data. From there you can change fire rate ammo damage accuracy and even the ability to make any gun fully auto. Dont believe me? Check this out.  The cheat engine in that video isnt even recompiled. If they can build out a full anti cheat that protects against all forms of data manipulation or they shift all the data to be handled via server I wouldnt not only be surprised but delighted. I just dont think they have the time  care enough.They could do what warframe another MMO did and create a function that obfuscates the addresses and reassigns them constantly making it so only the more experienced hackers can find any values.,thedivision,d0mutpk,1,t5_2xiqd

6799131,0,t1_d0mwel1,Sucks that you couldnt buy a digital version for consoles.  I rather enjoyed the coop gameplay and am excited for it. I fully believe that the game will provide a decent gaming experience and a good number of hours of entertainment.Of the  friends I frequently play other games withMostly Arma who joined me in the Open beta  were not impressed by the lack of communication about endgame content they simply did not have enough information to feel confident in a purchase or they didnt feel the game had much more variety to offer than what was in the beta thus they decided to cancel pre orders and wait to see how the game rolled out and what the season pass DLC would actually deliver and then decide if it was worth it for them or not. I expect that they having been following the game closely and getting hyped about it felt let down. I on the other hand had not been following the game at all and went into the OB having only seen the announcement trailer from like  years ago the one where everyone was pissing their pants about the police car door closing. I was impressed mostly by the game engine how the game looked and the atmosphere created in the environments. the regular difficulty missions seemed too easy but they were lower level ones. The Hard mode mission when scaled up for a full party of appropriate leveled and geared people felt great. and if the rest of the missions and endgame content take this further then I will be more than happy. The OB exceeded my expectations and earned my preorder.My perceived trolling ismostly due to people being overhyped about things that have no basis in fact and are pure speculation. They see someone posting objective analysis of facts that contradict their feelings  and they get defensive and angry they attack someone simply speaking the truth because  they need to believe there is more because the Hype has told them there is and they dont want to be let down.I am excited for the game and what it is. I am not here to raise unrealistic expectations just to be let down.And I do resent the people who are unable to objectively analyse marketing media. Ignorance is Bliss right?of course there was a touch of actual trolling today... the poor kid got so upset he broke down and started calling me mean namesand even resorted to fucking my Mom.

You can also remove the paint from the normal weapons and add it to another weapon however you want. Highend weapons are no different than others it was just in the beta the only high ends we saw were unique weapons.The mods can be added to any weapon that has the proper slot.

I enjoyed the the use of gadgets and abilities in the Division I think that grind is fine since I work and dont play for hours upon hours at a time.

Which I get is cool for immersion but when there is nothing to do besides go from mob spawn to mob spawn or wait for someone to call for extraction it can get awfully boring. Maybe it will get better as they add more stuff into the DZ. For me the tension only really existed when I called for extraction came across some rogues or I saw another player approach me.

With controller you have a much wider range of movement.Im not sure what it is exactly with this game but the movement just feels wrong and off using the keyboard. Maybe the binary inputs and the way the camera moves with you is just putting me off but I found it really clunky.With the exception of racing games and darksouls I rarely use a controller for anything on PC.

6848268,0,t1_d0sjc9v,Well Division has NO classes you can learn all the abilities and perks and talents in the game and swap between them at any time you choose mix and match from multiple trees to combine defensive with DPS or heals or just go down one path its your choice at the end of the dayThe story here seems to be well done so far it is fairly engaging because of how real this is viral outbreak spreading through money with all the antivaxxers out there it makes it even more real.The size of the game isnt MASSIVE ha pun but its about the same size as fallout  someone worked out but with a lot more underground areas buildings and rooftops to explore.The armor sets for stats in this game youd probably hardly notice as you level the body armor and pads look cooler slightly. They are limited to body armor pads gloves holsters etc. But the kicker is shirts jackets pants hats and stuff like that are purely cosmetic so you can max and match your look as you please.I wanna add in the game isnt like a MMO though its an online RPG the PvEvP zone called the DARKZONE is limited to a certain amount of players per instance so it doesnt get too hectic and trust me its hectic enough as is check out some vids from and for more infosTLDR Division is a RPG first and a cover based shooter second and they didnt skimp on either,thedivision,d0sk3ss,2,t5_2xiqd

6848525,0,t3_49ibpj,Once you add a friend on uPlay Only have to do this once per friend you can use an in game interface to form groups that will keep you together. The servers are nonselectable and invisible to the players but this is better as your group is all you need.The DZ is player vs player and again you cant select a server but your group will be with you.Outside of the DZ only people in your group may join you excluding specific areas which show other players in a forced peaceful environment.You can enter another bracket for levels higher than your friends but you can also make  different characters.

The game is really generous with ammo and restock boxes anyway. As Im sure you know not all enemies are shielded. Mainly just the big baddies or medium level enemies. Very low ranking thugs will have no shields and die in  shots or so. If every enemy were that weak the game would be fairly boring.,thedivision,d0t6a7t,2,t5_2xiqd

6855975,0,t1_d0tcfwf,I disagree. However how long I disagree for is entirely dependent on how the Developers handle EndGame PVE. While Yes the Division is an RPG it was definitely designed very much like Destinyan MMO and that being said. This game has a TON of potential if they were to release Raids. The Missions are far more like Dungeons than they are missions. It doesnt matter how good you are you cant solo a hard mission  Levels above your level but with  people you absolutely can. All they have to do is ramp it up a little bit and they have raids. If one of the missions required  or  people was filled with elite enemies and had  bosses instead of  how would it be any different from a raid? But I dont think this is what the devs have planned as of right now though. I think its what they should have planned if they want this to last but who knows.,thedivision,d0tflpn,3,t5_2xiqd

When discussion fictional characters without concrete orientations the medical research officer had an exwife but this doesnt make her a lesbian queer is a common and mostly understood way of describing their orientation. So yeah as long as youre not referring to real people who dont ID as queer or calling someone real or fictional a queer youre in the qulear! Sorry,thedivision,d0vrvxi,3,t5_2xiqd

Skipping this step could potentially be your problem if you havent.  After reading even more I think I found something else. Try underclocking your GPU by about  on memory and core clock. If that fixes your issue great! After that try cutting the underclocking in half to  each. ,thedivision,d0vt4wm,1,t5_2xiqd

So me who can only play  hours a day is going to literally take x as long because I cant sit there and farm the fuck out of things.One thing I do like about dailies is that I can feel like Im achieving at approximately the same rate as everyone else. And as long as you can still get some credits farming the people who have nothing to do but play division all day have a way to get more than just the dailies.Is there a good solution? Not really. The way they did it yourOPs solution and my idea are all bad. Each of the three basically fucks over one group or another in different ways.I guess this is why as I get older and my workpersonal life becomes more important Im finding myself less and less interested in MMOs.I just simply cant keep up.

6895529,0,t3_4a3gbb,I agree with you the last thing this game needs is to be like DayZ or HZ where the only way to play is to assume everyone is KoS if you want to avoid being farmed.  I also think that pvp is a little too disincentivized right now.  Say there were a scale from  to  where  is no one ever pvps and  is instant kill on sight  of the time.  DayZ and HZ are like a  imo and the division is maybe around a  or  right now.  If they bumped it up to maybe around a  I think youd get some extra added suspense without it being completely crazy.  My crew killed a few rogues today one dropped k dz credits one dropped k.  This is entirely too much.  Thats literally  hours of farming for these guys gone in an instant.  You should at most lose maybe an hour or twos worth of dz credit farming.  I believe the system is based off of a percentage of your current dz credits. If thats true I think that should change too. It should be a set value maybe based on your DZ rank or how far down the path to villainy you are.  If youve been farming dz rank  people as a dz rank  then yeah you should lose a ton when you die.  Killing one guy then dying and losing  hours worth of farming credits and items way over the top.  They could also add some kind of mob tapping system to encourage competing for bosses instead of groups just all getting a shot on the boss before it dies to get loot.  Im personally against that but its an idea.  Just my  cents.,thedivision,d0xxdcu,1,t5_2xiqd

6897691,0,t3_4a5zu0,Many talents feels not useful and to synergize with your playstyle for instance im suprised there is no talent that gives you after reload increases your fire rate by x .or for instance when you shield blocks X dmg you it self repairs for x of damage dealt to it.when your healing station pulses a heal it also applies a healing over time effect that lingers fr  seconds even if your outside of it.instead we have wierd stuff like incanary bullets can deal aoe damage and stuff like that its an mmo game right keep in mind we have diffrent roles. make talents work towards those roles damage tankhealer or hybrid.right now many talents dont do any big effect at all and to orthodox to even be useful.like they force you for instance cover to cover is one of the few that is a damage talent and it forces you to move from a cover to have an effect well lets say you are in a good position it forces you to not shoot wich is damage loss also to begin with.and kiill buffs i understand but still its horrible especially when in endgame pve.Its been proven time and time in mmo kill effects are good for levling and terrible for endgame and becomes a dead talent.Hope this sheds some light on the crew more effective talents dont have just passive crit dmg and fire rate talents have that you gotta use an ability reload zoom in with sniper. like do things for them to activate and maybe have a cooldown with it.But atleast have them be useful!maybe a medic station talent allows you to have x medic stations out at the same time?Like you get the idea.,thedivision,d0y66um,1,t5_2xiqd

That will only ruin your own game.Second if anything its a huge disadvantage to those players who farmed it so quickly.

Have the servers try and keep it balanced so there is a relatively even number of each group represented in the DZ.  Then make both groups be able to go on the attack and build up a timer.Make it so you still have the ability to get a group of  which means if one person goes on the attack the whole group gets a timer going but you can still run into other playersgroups on your side rogue or nonrogue for help.  Though they would have to weigh the options of whether they want a timer as well.Nonrogues cant attack other nonrogues and the same with rogues.  So that way you can at least attack NPCs together without the threat of accidentally getting a timer.  But you would still need to be on the lookout for rival agents.Just thought of this so it probably has some flaws Im not thinking of but its a start.edit  there could even be rogue and nonrouge specific safe houses.,thedivision,d0zloh7,2,t5_2xiqd

6916613,0,t3_4agp31,I currently run a full electronics build and while I dont think its ideal its more than capable of tanking any NPCs that came my way. I also use the Damascus HighEnd Pistol and while im sure there are better pistols for this build I can kill Yellowtier NPCs relatively easy. I have roughly k Ballistic Shield HP and only k HP so that may be a problem but honestly I dont run into problems with my low HP that often and when I do its almost always because I messed up or something. I use the Reactive Targeting mod for my shield as Kinetic Breaker is pretty useless for me since I have low HP anyway.My second skill varies from time to time depending on the situation Im in. If a mission requires us to defend something I use the Turret Active Sensor but if I am teamed up with godly DPSers I just use Support Station Life Support. If it requires us to push I use First Aid Overdose to give myself a little more leeway to tank flankers. Otherwise if I think I can position myself around the map without worrying about the flankers I use Seeker Mine Airburst for that additional crowd control. If I am in the DZ I use Sticky Bomb BFB and coupled with my very high Electronics stat I can actually bring down the occasional rogue if I have to.As for talents I use On The Move Critical Save and Combat Medic. These talents let you stack as much healing and damage reduction as you naturally can but they can be swapped for other more situational talents if you want to.My main weaknesses are fire flankers and grenades. I didnt encounter many problems with flankers because I am pretty good at positioning myself during fights so that they are all always roughly in front of me. Flamethrowers bypass my shield so I try to keep my distance whenever they are present and I just straferoll away from grenades.As I have said this build is far from ideal so ask other people that have tried stacking stamina instead and using the Kinetic Breaker mod if you want to go that route.,thedivision,d10bkli,1,t5_2xiqd

Like you knew a gun was better just by looking at it. I think in the Division the mods play a much larger role in setting up the perfect gun. Ive gotten a bunch of guns that appear worse at first but once its got a few decent mods its far better. I think this sets it apart from destinys gun system because you can get better mods at every level. even if a gun is far below youre level you can set it up so its on par.

Right now DZ is only viable to farm purples to deconstruct thats about it literally. Only about  hours in and that became the only reason for me to go in to DZ. What massive needs to do is to hold their word and make DZ just as viable to get yellows one way or another because they did say that you would be able to get the same loot in both PVE and PVP but I dont see that happening when I can put one of the challenge missions on repeat with a full squad and get full yellow gear maybe not perfect but still yellow in  hours.

6919129,0,t1_d108t6y,The problem with having a global setting is that your instance can be wildly different from the norm. If the entire game gets the all clear there could be some servers where maybe one group decides to see if they can get away with going rogue. Then there could be another server where everything turns into anarchy immediately. On that second server the setting should go back to defcon  to discourage people from continuing to go rogue. But it wont because the entire game isnt behaving the same way only that server.

You may wipe once or twice until your group gets the hang of it but inevitably you can take them down with ease with enough practice. You just need long straight corridors pulses and possibly some smart cover for more damage output. Also coordinate aggro if the shotgunner is shooting someone else shoot him and unload it all into his head. Dont be afraid to die to take one down for the team. Your teammates can revive you and it can give them time to regroup and reload. ,thedivision,d10sb4w,1,t5_2xiqd

6921059,0,t3_4aj22c, agree. Players whining is what killed WoW PvP for me. The game had a great power dynamic at first with a RockPaperScissors sort of balance to it. People who didnt understand this probably the same people complaining about rogue rewards bitched on the forums relentlessly that their class and spec didnt have every ability in the game and wasnt strong against every other class and spec in the game. What happened? Rather than have every class stand out and be strong in one particular way and weak in another they brought everyone to the middle. Now every class has pretty much every type of ability in the game rogues can heal themselves Paladins can fear and the PvP is just boring. No one stands out you play more or less than the same no matter what youre facing. My point here is that people often have very strong opinions about things they dont understand. I worry that the generation of entitled he has that weapon so I deserve it too players are going to kill this game if they are listened to. Not everything should be easy. Thats what makes games boring. ,thedivision,d10tqm0,29,t5_2xiqd

Tech support to keep the turret up Chain Reaction to increase Seeker Mine dmg Police Up to keep me full on ammo Demolition Expert in case I feel the need to throw another grenade or need to blow the turret master mod after using a seeker mineI like it so far but I have to point out the game intentionally penalizes the turret focus with the Gold Engineers who will hack it. You can I believe still deploy them as bombs in that case but the Developers clearly sought to discourage or penalize this build with mechanics.Positives You deal AOE damage to everyone The temp CC from the burn status gives the party some pure burn time on multiple enemies With exceptions like the shotgunners the turret acts somewhat like an area of denial weapon as well as a mini tank.Im open to suggestions as to different talents and all that or gear since Im still in all purples.

A chance at getting some purples off players and to make players salty. Thats why its not balanced. You risk a massive amount while the reward is pitiful due to the private public drop issues.This is why there is hardly any PVP in the DZ. People dont see a reason to go rogue  only if they are doing it to annoy other players. If thats your incentive then fine but ultimately thats not what going rogue is about.Now Im not a game designer so Im not going to make suggestions on how it should be balanced but right now its not very well balanced at all  partially due to the reasons that the OP in this thread described.,thedivision,d121wfd,2,t5_2xiqd

Maybe I just suck but its hard to hose headshots with those  roundsI miss my LMG with bonus damage to headshots and heal with crits. Its because of those talents I thought we Agents in the game had shields think Halo etc because I would be getting hit by NPCs but not take damage to health.

6932341,0,t1_d123g5i,Will do very very very little to show you how any modern internet connection will perform for gaming. All it test is bandwidth which pretty much any decent connection will have plenty of and a one time ping to a server with very little load on it. Most modern games use less than  or  mb up and down so pretty much any connection will have that no problem. However for gaming pingpacketloss and jitter are all very very important and can not be tested at that sight. The best way to test is to ping the actual game server from the command prompt for a solid minute or two and make sure you are getting a stable ping with little to no spikes and no packet loss. If you cant ping the actual server you will be playing on then pinging a different server around the same physical location is next best and if you cant find that then doing the test to  different websites will work ok as well. ,thedivision,d123ugd,3,t5_2xiqd

6932872,0,t1_d125ipl,If you can kill  agents like that then great but why wouldnt the zone have an alert go out notifying all the other agents. Im still guessing to pull that off though that youre already pretty well geared and the loot you steal isnt likely to be enough of an incentive. You can only carry  pieces max anyway so what do you do with the leftovers? I dont think reserving loot is a good solution for either side. Id like to see them add some additional system to the DZ which would encourage you to make a choice with your agent to be a rogue or loyal agent since you dont need to break down a bunch of junk once youre well geared. I just dont think the default should be about killing agents on sight. The developer can balance it in a variety of ways but going rogue should always be a gamble not a guaranteed reward. If anything maybe loot shouldnt be instanced in the DZ so that the tension is over who will get that purple that dropped or you can try and be stealthy and steal it once youve seen them pick up a few purpleorange pieces.,thedivision,d1260sz,1,t5_2xiqd

The echos just tell parts of the story and as cool as it is it isnt amazing IMO. Thats why I think the story is weak. If an echo shows a girl dying from the virus its sad but honestly it isnt relevant to my character in the game and stuff like that. To me its kind of just like this random person died in a sad way. We dont really know the people. Its cool that it shows what happened when the virus hit and how people reacted but seriously every game Ive played that had a similar story about society crumbling also did this.

6940201,0,t1_d12xg2y,The choice of Raindrop Prelude is an interesting one  enough so that Im inclined to believe it was chosen intentionally. The piece was influenced by Chopins struggle with tuberculosis a disease that was typically fatal in the s.The prelude was composed during Chopins stay in Majorca during the miserable winter of  an island off the eastern coast of Spain. He had gone there with the woman he was having an affair with  which was not received well by the Catholic residents of the island when it was discovered  forcing them to stay at a monastery which did him no favors in his struggle with the tuberculosis that eventually killed him in . Many of the pieces composed during their stay were written as Chopin struggled through fevered dreams. The Raindrop moniker of the prelude was given by his lover to the piece in response to one such dreams a nickname he hated but it stuck.  gt He saw himself drowned in a lake. Heavy drops of icy water fell in a regular rhythm on his breast and when I made him listen to the sound of the drops of water indeed falling in rhythm on the roof he denied having heard it. He was even angry that I should interpret this in terms of imitative sounds. He protested with all his might  and he was right to  against the childishness of such aural imitations. His genius was filled with the mysterious sounds of nature but transformed into sublime equivalents in musical thought and not through slavish imitation of the actual external sounds.A stay on an island Majorca  Manhattan during the winter struggling with an incurable deadly disease Tuberculosis  Green Poison and no respite save for their piano Chopin  Kwan. Its a pretty canny metaphor.edit Whats heard ingame is only the first portion of the piece. Its a far more dramatic composition in its entirety.

So even though you could start up some PvP by going rogue yourself its really not worth it due to how much shit you lose upon death. I think a better solution is to even out the penalty for dying as a rogue to encourage more PvP.

To me everything feels unrewarding right now so I play only the dailies until they tune up the credits back a bit or add more to the game.

6945499,0,t1_d13drp5,There should be pure PvP but I think the DZ is still an excellent concept. It should not be either pure PvP or PvE and both playersets must compromise accordingly. The different motivations will actually create the tension of the zone  instead of everyone wanting to farm or everyone attacking other players you will never really know. The issue with rogue right now is PvP is too costly even just dieing fighting rogues can be painful. Death for both rogues and normal players should be much more acceptable  that way instead of mostly gankers we will see people actually willing to have proper fights. I want to see some massive free for alls squad fights situations where everyone who wants to get involved can see ten rogue icons in one area and everyone else can stay the fuck away.,thedivision,d13lpex,0,t5_2xiqd

End game PvP is why I came and Im left feeling..... well it fucking sucks terribly thats how I feel.You get to end of a RPG in a week not an MMO.  MMOs are timeless.  This game got the rap of an MMO which I think hurt it.  If it was just a straight up RPG which it is then I can see it doing better.The issue here is really one thing and this pertains to Destiny and Division alike..... THEY ARE NOT FUCKING MMOs OR EVEN CLOSE!!!!!!!!!!!! to infinity  They are RPGs that have a very thin MMO layered feel to them and everybody just says OMG look at this new console MMO!  They arent period.  If you think they are MMOs please stop reading here and go bash your head into a wall for a few hours....Now all that said I did expect more endgame content from Division.

6947518,1,t1_d13t8nf,Actually my opinion is that the real problem here is that the Division lacks proper endgame content to satisfy both groups so theyve attempted to solve it by squishing everyone together. I dont think it properly serves PVE players or PVP. Thats exactly what happens when you try to cludge together a solution to fit two diametrically opposed requirements. I dont really believe there is a balanced solution to be found. Regardless of how opinionated the PVP sector is they only represent a small fraction of the playerbase Ubisoft needs to keep playing and spending money. With the current lack of viable PVEonly endgame content they will be forced to water down the Dark Zone to keep it enticing for those PVE players if they have any hope of retaining players and selling those season passes. So all of these please make the dark zone better for pvp posts are basically so much wasted breath until the endgame content expands significantly beyond its current scope. They simply cant do enough to make the PVP group happy without alienating the PVE group who represent by far the majority of players.What I find ironic is that I dont even think the addition of more PVEonly endgame content will make PVP players happy because whether they will admit it or not they want low skill PVE players around to kill. We saw exactly this recently when Destiny switched to skill based matchmaking...top pvp streamers left and right were complaining constantly that they didnt have any more easy matches against poor players. So to reiterate again I dont think there is a balanced solution to this problem. ,thedivision,d13tyor,1,t5_2xiqd

6955032,0,t3_4ayt69,Great post and will be really helpful for many players. Upvote for you. But theres a couple small things that you might consider tweaking or fixing.gtThis will keep your weapons kick or drift pattern in a straighter horizontal line.So stability makes your gun not drift AS MUCH rather than in a specific direction where as horizontal stability keeps you on a straight vertical line. I assume this is a typo. You mean to say that horizontal stability keeps you on a straight horizontal line.But this isnt entirely correct either way. All weapons have horizontal and vertical recoil. With high horizontal stability it mitigates horizontal sway meaning you recoil more vertically. With more stability you will still recoil horizontally but recoil less vertically.gtInitial Bullet StabilityEffects the recoil of your weapon on your very first shot.I believe this is not completely correctnot fully explained. Initial Bullet Stability is how quickly your crosshair recovers from recoil or aiming from behind cover or stopping movement while aiming down sights. How fast it goes from wide to closed. Particularly useful on Snipers where the crosshair splits wide after each shot. This reduces the time it takes the crosshair to become fully accurate again.gtSMGsImproved Optimal Range  Crit DamageI might be worth pointing out that the highest possible you can increase range by is  meters I believe from the highest rolled Scope. It may be less preferable than Headshot  Crit Scopes depending on playstyle.,thedivision,d14opm1,4,t5_2xiqd

6955950,0,t3_4atz74,Challenge modes are pretty easy when you have good gear. Ive noticed that trying to balance your stats instead of minmaxing just sets you back. Ive put on all Firearms gear threw on some stamina mods to get to k hp  my Black Market AK has almost a full accuracy bar and  RPM with a  round mag with just over k weapon damage for anyone curious about sheet dps it sits around k with neither talents active and the third free talent being a  reload speed bonus. It melts everything outside of challenge modes and most enemies in challenges aside from the heavy guards take at most a mag and a half alone. With teammates everything dies pretty damn quickly with some focus fire.The only challenge mode so far that requires any semblance of strategy outside of using stuns and crowd control abilities is the Power Plant at the very end with the rd wave of enemies in the boss room containing about  or  rushers with shotguns. And all you have to do to counter that is pull them into the previous room leave some distance between you and them and unload as they come down the steps.One concern with challenge modes is to tune either AI or something to force enemies to make players move. Ranged enemies are happy to take their positions and lose slowly when instead they should be more proactive in flanking player positions. Enemy grenades arent anything but a minor annoyance even if they are literally spamming your position with grenade after grenade. The only threats in this game are rushers with shotguns and theyre squishy in their own right when you have any kind of stun available.Ive farmed every firearms gear blueprint that was available the Black Market AK blueprint every weapon mod blueprint and a stamina gear mod blueprint from the PXC vendor and this is all after the PXC drop nerf doing matchmaking challenge modes over and over again. There is zero communication or coordination required except for the last section of the Power Plant mentioned above provided everyone brings adequate crowd control abilities and its completely possible for two people to run them without any trouble other than the mission taking longer than it should and except for the timed section during the Power Plant though that would be a decent challenge.I think challenge modes are okay where they are now but they need more finesse  not just thicker enemies that do much more damage. Throw a timer on the mission. Or throw timers on objectives so that there are checkpoints. Force players to have to choose between playing it slow and safe or having to restart cause they didnt kill anything fast enough. Make AI smarter  flanking while flooding players with grenades or pushing up with their rushers. Make sections less open where possible ie. prevent being able to kite infinitely through a level and stop players from cheesing encounters by hiding in an elevator alcove Lexington roof or pulling every single enemy back to an incredibly unfair vantage point Lincoln Tunnel final area before the boss. Enemy AI gets INCREDIBLY dumb when you start pulling them out of the areas that you were supposed to fight them in ie. Server Room in Russian Consulate.EDIT Also since everyone loves to compare this to Destiny  the endgame here might be much more enjoyable than it was for Destiny on release but getting to that endgame boredom in Destiny was much more difficult than it was for me in The Division.,thedivision,d14sgxc,1,t5_2xiqd

6960191,0,t3_4b19h5,IMO the best mag you can get is one with mag size and rate of fire. The best way to increase damage with the vector or any SMG is to increase the number of bullets you have and the speed at which you can inject them into the sponge.  As far as crit chancedmg goes Id say since youre approaching the  mark prepulsebuffssig skills that you need some more crit damage. In most RPGs the critcrit dmg ratio stands at about  meaning for every percent of crit you have you want to have  crit dmg.

I completely understand their point of the lack of endgame content but ffs  the game is two weeks old and people have put more time into this game than most people do in a month of a full time job. Those sort of people need to start recognizing that sometimes their patience needs to be kept in realistically check for what the developers can actually put to entertain you  let alone entertain you for . And Massive is fixing things as fast as they can  yes some of the fixes are nothing more than artificial means to extend play time removing the large PC reward for Boss killing for example  but can you blame them?

6988210,0,t3_4bdmql,Had a very similar experienceMy brother and I were running the DZ and sure enough I killed a named boss and it dropped a High end AK.  Obviously I started freaking out to my brother and immediately advised we go to a extraction point.  WE were a little higher up in the DZ so we decided to traverse down a little bit to the lower level DZ to extract and not get bombarded by NPCs.  Sure enough we come accross another  man group me being the nice person I tried to invite them to make a full squad no intention of telling them what I had and me just inviting them for the extra firepower at the extraction.  They decline my invite and at this point my brother had wondered off somewhere.  Out of nowhere the  assholes start shooting me me being frantic I ran towards my brother screaming at him asking where the fuck he had gone.  I turn a corner after popping multiple med kits and my security buff and sure enough there is my brother to the rescue with his handy First Wave MA and starts absolutely hammering them.  As I get caught up to him I pop my support station and whip out my sniper as well and start hammering down shots at that point they started a full retreat.  We then tried to find the most desolate extraction zone and begin the stressful  seconds that would be the extraction counter sure enough I finally get my AK extracted and have officially recieved my first High End Weapon.  With all this being said THIS WAS BY FAR THE MOST FUN IVE HAD IN A VIDEO GAME IN YEARS.

6994729,0,t1_d18xo8k,The damage resistance from smart cover mobile cover and survivor link is flat damage resistance and affects every form of damage except environmental.  Its calculated separately from armor and has no cap. Mobile cover also has a unique blast resistance stat that reduces explosive damage by  and the combination of  pure damage resistance and  blast resistance should reduce explosive damage taken to around  of the normal damage. Bullet damage will be reduced by both pure resistance and armor and so I will only take around  damage from bullets when in my mobile cover. The combination of countermeasures mobile cover  smart cover gives me around  increased damage and  increased crit chance too so my damage aint shabby either. If my cover goes down and it really doesnt that often since not many enemy types are coded to shoot at it and it doesnt take blast damage then I get  seconds of  damage resistance and that gives me  pure resistance and . bullet resistance if I stay in smart cover. Its super fun to stare down AI tanks and just unload my MA into their face but it does require a guy willing to keep throwing out ammo cache support stations for me so that I can keep smart cover up .

6999154,0,t1_d19mmwk,Separate Pvp gear and a leaderboard would pretty much eliminate the RPG element from the darkzone and turn it into a separate game altogether.  The way it is now it feels like an integral part of the base game with a great connection to the rest of the city and the rest of the story.  I think its too early to rule out the possbility that theyre going to be incorporating more of the PvE element into the dark zone as evidenced by previous posts regarding the expansion map and dz incursion plans etc.   I just feel like going rogue should carry a big risk.  I understand that it sucks to lose so much Ive lostregainedlost several levels and theres nothing worse than the feeling of losing hours of progress but you understand the risk of that entering the DZ and potentially attacking another player.  Youre attacking them to get something they worked for in this case a high end drop or multiple high end drops and if you fail they take away something that you worked for. Since youre the aggressor in this case it makes sense that the penalty is steeper if you lose. Apart from the game mechanics I feel like being that this is an RPG going rogue should be super risky because of what it means in terms of the lore of the game. Youre essentially turning on whats left of the government for the promise of some more powerful weaponry or piece of advanced technology.  In that scenario youre forsaking whatever oath or vows you took as a SHD agent basically committing treason and as such that should be punishable by death should the government catch you.  As death by itself in game carries with it no real penalty they have to add a pretty severe penalty to go along with it hence the xpmoneyitem loss. I can understand both arguments in this situation and I think its too early in the game to say this is what it doesdoesnt need because with more content on the way big changes they make now may not be as effective. It may make more sense for them to try and balance out whats here now and see how things shape up.  ,thedivision,d19p4qs,3,t5_2xiqd

Calling out adds let the team know that another group of bad guys just joined the party and everyone had to adjust.  This was true of any encounter be it a Raid boss fight or just an open world skirmish with a handful of NPCs.Trivia pats or pather was a term that overlapped adds in that it indicated a single or multiple hostiles that wandered or followed their path into the fight.

7005980,0,t3_4blv9p,I appreciate your very detailed post in regards to your memory leak issues. However this has nothing to do with The Division game or Massive.The problems you are having is related to a Windows  bug and Microsoft has yet to fix this.To find out if you have the bug or if your rig is memory leaking. The easiest and quickest way is to open up task manager select the Memory tab and look for a process called System and Compressed Memory. If your rig is memory leaking you will see this process at the very top about the second or third biggest process running. This will increase and take up further computing resources the longer this process is left alone.The name of the .exe that is causing the problem is actually a required windows process called ntoskrnl.exe which is also known as the Windows NT Kernel. Unfortunately this being a Windows process we cant exactly remove it or delete it. The solution well tbh I have yet to find one that actually fixes the problem. I have been dealing with this issue for months now and have scavenged the interwebs for several solutions. Most require you to disable some windows  features I have even gone as far as making regedits. Regardless anything I do does not resolve the issue. So that being said the easiest and fastest way to fix this issue when it occurs is to restart your computer. Keep a task manager window always open. Once you see system and compressed memory spike. Restart.. Painful I know but this is a Windows  issue not much more we can do about it. tldr this is not a Division or Massive problem. This is a Windows  memory leak restart your computer for a quickfix.,thedivision,d1ah0s7,1,t5_2xiqd

7009509,0,t1_d1ar40d,I disagree the average player couldnt do challenge mode like the average player couldnt do inferno.  The difference is Power Plant was the biggest threat to the average player and since this is an FPS people were carried and mechanics were abused.The cost of failure and RMA are one of the few differences from D otherwise we have the insane damage even if geared the extremely low drop rates which is compounded by a short listed drop table and of course matching up the right perkstalents stats to even make the  item worth using.On top of all that high end division tech is still a bottle neck its not as bad as it was before but it can take a few hours to get  to  crafts.I think a lot of the apologizers are forgetting DZ is competitive outside of PvP you have to get to the bosses and boxes or you get nothing so all this does is promote server hoping to get away from all competition or simply to quickly reset boxesbosses which makes it no different from Bullet King which is players taking the road with the least resistance.,thedivision,d1avh0q,1,t5_2xiqd

After hitting thirty and realizing this was not the case I did a few missions to see if you can get supplies out of doing challenge modes or something.

7027355,0,t1_d1cvngz,gt that includes blue Vectors Ive crafted at my level.My understanding is that you shouldnt really be crafting anything pre level . The leveling in the game is fast enough that youll find something very soon after or youll get a drop from some mission or other that just makes that crafted weapon a waste. Personally I didnt sell a single weapon as I leveled turned everything into crafting mats and upgraded those mats to HE when I hit . Ive crafted the Liberator and a Vector as well as a couple other HE guns and mods and a backpack. You can play in the DZ with a sniper but you wont be at optimal range very often and unless youre able to use it very very well youll probably die to someone running the Vector. Theres too much shit that you can jump behind and sneak up on people. I wouldnt rely on that weapon in PVP.Generally my experience in the DZ has been Oooo a group of enemies! proceed to shoot enemies and as running around to loot them  other agents come out of the woodwork. These encounters are generally less than  meters away perfect range for the Vector and are peaceful they just want to grab gearcreds. In the event that one of them cracks off a shot and goes rogue theyll die because there are  other guys standing around with Vectors out. Its a massive deterent. If youre standing around looting holding an MA instead and theres nobody else around and Ive got that Vector...Im probably gonna shoot you repeatedly in the face and take your stuff. The timer is fairly short in Rogue  and what if you got a HE drop from the named elite? If you have the Vector Im probably not gonna risk it because if yours dropped and is better than mine you could melt me before I melt you.,thedivision,d1cwjqo,1,t5_2xiqd

7027634,1,t1_d1crf9l,hijacking top comment to say that Im vehemently opposed to this.... the best high end gear is only craftable with DZ credits and it should absolutely NOT be easy to acquire. this is working as intended IMO.as someone who has no lifed the game since launch currently . days with days logged within the first week since launch and a rank  dz ... yes it is still difficult for me to craft perfect high end gear because dz tech is still hard to come by but if you are rolling with a good team and keep your eyes open you can work for an hour and come up with enough to craft one or two pieces.will it be the best piece off the bat? if youre lucky and the roll gods are smiling on you. want to craft other rolls? grind more. youre talking about the BEST LOOT IN THE GAME currently in an MMO that they want to appeal to both casuals and no lifers like myself.the real underlying issue is the struggle between favoring truly hardcore players no lifers vs casuals. everybody wants to feel like they have access to the true end game shit after buying the game but you cant satisfy both camps.ive busted my ass to craft my perfect rolls on lvl dz gear and weapons  kneepads  masks etc and theres no way in hell that the same opportunity should be given to the next guy who isnt willing to or cant afford to put in the time. IF they do decide to create an upgrade mechanism for greens or blues it should be insanely expensive. Like  greens   yellow  blues   yellow. None of this carebare upgrade bullshit that will  give everyone and their cousin access to the best high end gear. the path is clear so go work for it.EDIT wow huge blowup. expected to get downvoted to oblivion but glad to see those who have spent equal time and are fellow minmaxers totally get it. those to know know what massive is going for. to those saying youre not having fun running from crate to crate  heres a protip youre doing it wrong  glad to contribute to the conversation and of course AMAZING THANKS FOR MY FIRST GOLD internet hero!,thedivision,d1cxorn,17,t5_2xiqd

And have civilians dying from virus or hunger more often on the street if that area isnt safe. Hmm.. that gives me an idea of having supply routes between safe houses to supply the vaccine and food from BoO even if area is cleared youd see civilians die from virus hunger cold thirst etc. if theres no supply route established to that safe house which could also cost some credits to maintain not like we have any use for them.,thedivision,d1d0x9u,2,t5_2xiqd

How hard is it to make the game more like Diablo  which has taken the better part of  years to get loot right and instead make HEs drop a good rewarding rate and still make people want to play the game right because they know they have choices that will all lead to rewarding experiences?I dont want to spend my collective  hours a week getting maybe  HE drops that are all deconstructed by playing the right way in the DZ or getting some guaranteed shitty HE armor from mindlessly farming the same Challenge maps all day.I agree that people have rinsed the content clean already but it doesnt solve the fact that the loot system in this game is a huge problem.

7057129,0,t3_4c9z6q,Level  here. This is a great opportunity for you. Assuming you are reasonably stocked with phenix credits and tech you should seriously evaluate your build. I wouldnt focus much on the weapons except for what is your primary weapon you use. This will make sense in a minute.   Evaluate all your yellow gear first. What are the static talents that you cant change and do they play to your character? If not consider flagging them and either buying blueprints or hunting for drops hows your scavenging? or doing challenges to replace them. Yes you can do this before  but you now can make better decisions. Check the DZ vendor for things you want the easy way. Dont forget your BoO vendors.  Once you have the talents on the gear you want its time to reroll them to emphasize your build. Im a medic and my primary is an LMG. So everything I have is around stamina to keep me alive. Everything I couldnt orient around stamina I rolled for mod slots to add stamina or I rolled for armor or LMG damage. I sit in the back and suppress and heal while the bulls with DPS go charge the heavies.   Rerolling or building EVERYTHING towards your intended character build will have surprising improvements. The easy way to visually see the difference is to go out in the safe zone for fun with standardcrap gear and find some bad guys to kill. Then go back suited up and mow them down to see the difference.  On rerolling I cant emphasize  gear slot enough. You cant always get it but if you can its like a tuning fork for the perks you want because you can just build the mod. Next you need to reevaluate your skills and talents. Again my medic as an example. I emphasize things like sticky health bomb and support station to keep my crew alive and happy. But wait. I cant help if Im dead. So on the talent side I have things like covertocoverdamagereduction as well as whileundercoverdamagebuff so that I can stay alive. My team loves getting dropped by a heavy and I just calmly run in revive them and roll back to the back while only losing like half a bar and not even needing to heal back. Of course for some reason they also love shooting me when we arent squaded up because its so difficult to kill me.  EDIT  Dont forget also that you need to coordinate this with your team if you are working with a dedicated crew. Make sure that you are complimenting them and vice versa. For example my medic build may be tough to kill but also cant tear down groups in the DZ or elsewhere alone. If I didnt have bulls Id be in a bad place.  EDIT  You will also find that your build has adjustments based on DZ or challenges. Subtle but they help. I dont use the healing station as much in the DZ because my team is more spread out VS challenges. So I swap to pulse to up their crits. Its the little things...  EDIT  Regarding gear. Ive found that the drops are the best. Yes Ive bought a few high end items but the reality is saving your credits for the rerolls and finding solid high end drops is an exciting way to build your character. Dont spend all your credits on gear. Save it for rerolls. Lastly. The tuning never stops. If you get a good crew and go on challenging runs and rack up some solid yellow always evaluate before destroying. You might like the talent more. Yes it will cost you some rerolls but for the right gear its worth it. I hope this helps. Feel free to ask away although Im busy today Ill try and answer as best I can. Maybe a bull high DPS or tech will answer from their perspective. See you in the DZ. GTPsychopuff,thedivision,d1ga9jc,3,t5_2xiqd

If it became easier to coordinate amongst random players and you could have  man rogue groups youd see it more in the later DZ areas.

7061911,0,t3_4cc1f6,There are a few different loot caves that require different levels of cheese. You can glitch through walls using the deployable cover. This can be used to get through entire sections of missions most popular are the Police Academy and General Assembly. These are easy to do but will only get you level  gear. You can also get multiple groups in a lobby which makes running the challenge missions pretty easy. Lincoln tunnel is probably the easiest challenge mission and can be done very fast with  people. There is also a way to keep killing the final boss of the Russian Consulate mission. This either requires that your team be well geared or that you do the multi group lobby glitch and go with a big group. ,thedivision,d1gtu46,2,t5_2xiqd

7068285,0,t3_4cf1nx,I dont know exactly how much XP you lose but its relative to the perfect the of your current DZ rank. That way no matter how high your rank is you always lose a reasonable amount of XP as opposed to multiple levels like it used to be. Being killed by an NPC and being killed by another player while NOT being rogue will give you the same penalty loss of some DZ funds a DZ key and some XP. If you get killed by an NPC then chances are youre money and keys will still be there when you go back but you wont regain your XP. If you get killed by another player or an NPC while you ARE rogue then youll lose more money more keys and more XP. Again if nobody picks it up then you can go back and collect the money and keys but if youre rogue or killed by a rogue then chances are theyll pick it up automatically when they kill you. Rewards as a rogue vary. If you go rogue by mistake and only have your little  second timer then the reward will be minimal if you survive it. If you go full rogue and kill someone youll have a  second timer and if you survive youll get some DZ funds and some XP  its called a bounty and its the same as what another player would get if they kill you. I touched on number  but to clarify if you kill a rogue theyll drop some items from their loot if theyve picked any loot up and theyll also drop money and keys. When you down a rogue the quickest and easiest way to finish them is to melee them. Doing that will put you close enough to automatically pick up their keys and money but youd have to hold XSquareF to pick up their loot. Depending on their rogue rank  the reward can vary. Manhunt starts when a rogue has killed numerous people and got their timer to the maximum of  seconds. If they can survive the  minutes then they will get a decent bounty but likewise if you kill them youll get that bounty yourself. If youre a rogue and you get shot your timer will pause for  seconds. If youre in a group and one of them goes rogue it will send the whole group rogue with a few exceptions. If a group member is not in the DZ or is in a checkpointsafe room then they wont go rogue. Also the rogue timers are independent of each player in a group so its possible for one person in a group to have their timer run out before others if they dont get shot by anybody. ,thedivision,d1hjwjk,1,t5_2xiqd

7075276,0,t1_d1i48t9,Your example just takes your theoretical DPS and makes it even more theoretical...The only way to get actual DPS is to have a parserDPS meter in the game. Player skill will always be a large part of actual DPS in any game ever made. To ignore it completely is stupid.As much as the current accuracy formula infaltes DPS ignoring accuracy would be equally bad. Accuracy absolutely  has an effect on actual DPS. So does stability and horizontal stability since spray patterns in this game are randomized.The way a weapon handles plays a huge part in its effective DPS in an actual gunfight. Measurements like stability and accuracy do little to give realistic comparisons of this so the only way to test it is to fire the weapon yourself and see what works. As an example the Liberator and Lightweight M have nearly identical stats including stability. Fire them though and you will quickly see the M is overwhelmingly better because it is far easier to control at fullauto. This is especially true as distance to target increases. The way this is handled with the current DPS calculations is bad enough but removing it entirely would only make things worse.,thedivision,d1icgzo,1,t5_2xiqd

Never cross a street or intersection diagonally always go straight across its faster and allows you the least amount of time out in the open. Always bob and weave always. Use the subways OFTEN!

I do agree though. The DZ lacks any semblance of balance. And I understand that there will always be people with gear better than mine but the gap is pretty ridiculous at times. This is what bothers me about BKRC Farming Glitches  I have chosen not to partake. Not as some holier than thou statement but simply because its not how I choose to enjoy this game. If someone else wants to exploit good on them and I understand. Your time is valuable to you. But every person doing it is becoming stronger than I am in the DZ and that seems really unfair. I always thought the simplest thing would just be to have the tiers we do with caps on FirearmsStamElec. Like DZ caps everyone inside it at  or whatever. Scales up throughout. DZ being uncapped. Then also scale up the drop rate on those bosses by a large margin. A kkk shouldnt be able to just trample whatever group of lowbies he comes across  and the issue will only be extrapolated over time.

7095348,0,t1_d1kl2vq,... no need to write an essay to defend your point. The amount of play time I have is a lot but any game like this should infinitely repayable. Why do you feel the need to call my suggestions shit anyway have I offended you in some way man? The rewards and difficulty of the hard missions need to be scaled definitely. Yes there still could be challenging dailies it would still be like it is now with extra rewards. The suggestion to make every mission runable on challenge mode does not interfere with having challenging dailies as there could still be the challenge mission of the day. My suggestion would be to not get to invested in my current feelings about the game. Mostly because a lot of people would agree that there needs to be more engaging activities in the game. Dont need to make it your mission to prove your point cause you dont really have one your just bagging on the fact that I have a lot of play time. Im enjoying the game and always will and yes im very excited for incursions. How salty you sound though I doubt your gear score will be good enough in time for the update.

7118627,0,t1_d1n5g2u,Also about the talentsThe first one is a movement speed increase that is smaller than SL for surpressing an enemy. There is no surpressing in PvP and even in PvE it isnt really a viable tactic and especially not for getting a movement boost to run away. It is nice for surpressing the Ai and getting closer with a shotgun but it is not often used and not really comparable with SL.The second one is a  damage reduction for  seconds if you use a medkit when CRITICALLY wounded. So you need to have less than  of your HP and not die and use it. In PvP if you get shot and wait that long with your medkit you are often dead if not then it is possibly because you got in cover and the clock of  seconds started ticking. It is a nice boost but really defensive and not at all as offensive as SL.Also  seems alot on paper and you might think it is half the damage reduction you get from  but it is not.If one bullet deals  damage to you you take  damage with medkit trait but only  damage with SL so it is only one third.In other words if one vector clip  bullets with  magazine kills you it takes  bullets with the  reduction but  bullets with  reduction. So it is  clip with no reduction little more than   clips with  reduction but  clips with  reduction. See my point?,thedivision,d1nau98,1,t5_2xiqd

7122865,0,t3_4d4fkm,Its simple.People dont like getting killed by other players in videogames. Its exactly why you have ragequitters to straight carebears and everyone else in between.My thing is the DZ is basically as advertised. Youre opened to getting ganked during extractions. Thats been a thing since the very first E video they showed. So it fucking baffles my mind when people cry about it acting like there arent countermeasures against getting ganked during extractions. I mean people do realize you can literally just abandon the rope and go to another site if it doesnt seem ok to extract right?As for those scrubs who run glass cannon builds ganking undergeared dudes in DZ I love coming down to beat that ass. These clowns need to get good and fight against equal geared players not laugh about oneshotting some dude thats struggling to solo DZ.Massive does need to address the hackers on PC though. Shit gets annoying when youre chasing down a Rogue and he teleports up a couple blocks and then completely phases out. Its literally one of the core areas of their game and theyve left it completely open to all sorts of fucking hacks. Probably should have focused on that instead of nerfing farming exploits. But I mean who cares right? No hackers on consoles so the hacker issues on PC can take a backseat.I enjoy the PvP in the DZ. Is it perfect? Fuck no. Is it balanced? Not even close. But man some of the fights Ive had in this game is the best Ive experienced in a few years. If I wanted balanced PvP shooter gameplay Id go play CSGO or some shit.

The only thing they need to know is when people grind and get nothing while other people get lucky it generates jealousy and animosity and you lose players en masse.Developers best tool for combating gear staleness when everyone has BiS is upping the ilvl with new expansions not cock blocking player progression towards BiS.  This formula of allowing people to get BiS in some feasible time window and then resetting with higher ilvls has been tried and true for  decades now.  Why does MassiveUbi thing they are immune to that?As for boring if everyone has the same thing?Everyone would be driving Lamborghinis and Ferraris instead of Hondas if everyone could afford it.  Dont lie.Everybody has the same iPhone the same trendy  series BMW the same  flat screen nobody seems to care about that so why would it be boring in a game?  There is always going to be some build or item that is best.There is RNG that you can grind then there is RNG that you just give up because you know it will never happen once you calculate the odds.  There is a difference between farming something for a week and eventually getting it and knowing that you could farm non stop for the rest of your life and likely not see what youre after.Im not using a vector either.  I like my DeadlyBrutal M doing k headshots at  RPM.  I run vectorM indoors just because Im playing around with DeadlyDestructive on the Vector vs DeadlyBrutal on the M just for some variety and to see what I like more.  Vector would prob have it but Ive given up on ever rolling a DeadlyBrutalDestructive Vector.  Im too addicted to the laser beam mag dumps of the M more my style.,thedivision,d1p4lwl,4,t5_2xiqd

7151544,0,t3_4dhvid,This is the biggest mistake this game could make. I would say the majority of players who exploited a few of the farm methods that came about Bullet King challenge mode final boss did not do it for Pheonix Creds. I would think most did it for crafting materials. I know thats why I did it. PC are easy to get with an organized group farming Lexington in under  minutes a run on challenging so the PC was not a problem. Players looked for exploits to get crafting materials BECAUSE of how messed up the crafting system is already. Yes not everyone should be able to run around with a perfect roll vector. But that fact that it is less than  of a chance to get the exact  skills you want for your playstyle on a gun is terrible design. Now they are taking that awful grind of crafting materials taking away the exploits to farm them more efficiently and making it about x as hard to gian the materials. This is a gigantic mistake. Players looked for those exploits to get materials because the system was already flawed. Now they have gone and made it even harder.They can say it was so that not every player would have the best of  the best gear but in reality they are just making it near impossible to even get ONE item that is considered the best it could be.Ill give it  weeks after this patch if they dont do something to fix this or if this somehow isnt as big of a problem as it seems on paper and Im resubbing to WoW or something.

You know mil crit dmg headshot k hp and etc. Im very good in pve in killing bosses in cm and dz. But i have absolute zero chances in pvp because i just cant stand a single hit from vector or any other gun other than a pistol. So if i want to make a progress i need to change my playstyle? Thats absurd and limiting my experience. I dont want to tank and take agro. I played for  years in WoW with a mage and i love being a topdps lowhp. But srlsy it is impossible to pvp with this build. Yes the same applies to wow BUT PvP and PvE are sepparated. So you dont have any stimul to go and do PvP activities in WoW coz you wont progress at PvE at all. And vice versa you will suck at PvP while being in raidpve set. And here we got division and its broken system named pvpve dz. Want to make more dmg in cm and incursions? Welcome to dz have a nice bullet in your face from tanky dps vectors. Want to rock in pvp? Go agead and grind for mats to craft that deadly brutal vector. And you know i played dayz and dayz system isnt broken because it is surviving simulator where you have one life and thats it. You cant lvlup you cant loose exp. You spawn you loot and in  hours depends on your luck and your skills you are fully geared with army weapons clothing and that large red backpack. And if you die you start over. But the division is and rpgshooter. Take a look at destiny. PvP and PvE are separated like it must be. You can earn best gear via raidsgunsmith or you can play trials of osirisiron banner and get pvp guns there. or perfect example is Guild Wars . You can gather best top end game loot via much possible ways including pveonly pvponly or pvpve WvWvW. It is your choice on how you are going to do your progression and you can change your decision at any time. Got bored of fractals? Go ahead and try pvp system. Want to play massive pvp with large castle siege with npcs? WvWvW is your new home. And you are going eventually get ascended gear rather that mask backpack and knee pads on pve and gloves armor and holster in pvp btw armor chest and gloves give you much more advantage that mask and backpack.Massive massive i need you to take a deep breath and find your balls.

We try to supplement gear obtained from mission runs by crafting. In order to craft you have to have materials. The most efficient way to get materials is to run repetitive routes like the OPs.

I also run solo a lot even through the challenge mode missions so theres that.  Has to have selfsustained and deadly though. I dont care much for brutal as my damage in PvE is good enough with just ferocious and a good aug roll and Im not gonna be aiming for headshots exclusively in PvP but I need that healing.  The signature skill talents are shit though.

Sure but any lootgear based game has grind at the end its how they keep you playing.  I played Destiny as well and dont find the grind nearly as bad.  Although Im also not trying to minmax my build and roll a hundred weapons until I can get that perfect talent combo.  Im much more willing to just go with what I get as long as the base stats on the gungear are pretty good. I dont play the game every day but have put in about  hours and feel pretty happy with where Im at.  Ive got all HE gear even if its not the best right now and a couple good weapons.  I can run through DZ with a squad pretty easily and was able to  man one of the challenge modes without wiping.I feel the complaints of the grind are a little overblown.  Players want to get that perfect roll and so are grinding for hours.

7165241,0,t3_4dmanx,This has been my thought the entire time.  While you guys are ranting and raving on reddit about how dire this crafting material change is my first thought was ok there has got to be something else.  There is a reason for this.They arent going to make it x harder to craft gear just to slow us down that makes no sense.  So likely we are missing something.  My assumptionThey are planning to sway our gear source from crafted to dropped.  I will take a stab that the incursions loot drops will facilitate this.  Also the fact that you need set pieces to do the incursion challenge mode and if set pieces are drop only assumption then crafting will significantly fall behind dropped gear.,thedivision,d1smb8v,1,t5_2xiqd

7171005,0,t3_4dm833,I always feel like these kind of games leave me in the dust in terms of keeping up to date with gearing and doing raid content. Its one of the reasons I quit Destiny because no one I knew played it and I wasnt confident enough in PUGing raids.Come the Division at first it felt similar to Destiny in that I played solo through the whole game except story missions which arent too hard in a random group. Hard mode missions arent too difficult either. I soloed my way through the Dark Zone and Im nearing level  in time for the new ilevel update.I read posts on reddit telling me to obtain a certain level with my gear before attempting Challenge Mode. At this point I felt like the game was going to be something that I couldnt keep up with because people kept making posts telling me to use my mic or play in a group with friends but after grinding the dailies for around  weeks I managed to obtain a good HighEnd Vector and some affordable HighEnd knee pads. I said screw it why not try Challenging Dailies and see how it goes. I dont know if its based on server location but I live in Australia and since I started doing Challenge Mode late last week Ive managed to successfully PUG my way through the dailies with the first group each day. Granted we do sometimes die but rarely do we wipe and everyone seems to be skilled up properly.Hearing about Incursions also makes it feel like another end game raid like thing where Ill struggle to do well in. Hopefully it pans out like it did in Challenge Mode for me. Yet again Im not sure if its based on where you play from which in turn determines who you play with but so far PUGing seems to be manageable for me hope it is for you too.,thedivision,d1t9xw9,1,t5_2xiqd

This is just small formatting to make it clearer to read and have it in a place where it is more noticeably related to the content it refers to.. In between the challenge mode skin drops and the vendor skins put a small paragraph highlighting that the vendor skins displayed appear in certain level brackets as per below however the vendors stock rotates each day so you can wait for the skin you want to rotate around to your level range if you do not wish to create alts at each level bracket.,thedivision,d1th0fb,1,t5_2xiqd

But of the two HE drops and the countless purples more of my drops were useful with really good rolls and DMG numbers.

7178262,0,t3_4dt706,Even with having a  drop rate for a boss kill doesnt mean loot is going to saturate the playerbase. The boss is still only guaranteed to drop  item along with  other purples. RNG is still going to be the xfactor as the affixes and rolls will be randomly added to the drop. You wont be geared out in the best stuff after one day. Its prolly gonna be a table similar to most MMOs where certain items will have a higher chance to drop than others then factor in RNG for the affixes. Youll still be farming daysweeks for that semiperfectperfect piece of gear. In the meantime the crafting system will pose as a filler until you get that piece.,thedivision,d1u3qgl,1,t5_2xiqd

After the game adapted showing how much dps they did at the end even though its PvE alot of people started to take the game as if its another job and started to have higher and higher limitation to party invite like having k dps to run Lex like why? do you people not have fingers to control and still do enough damage that you need to have k dps ? and if their role score dps mostly dont meet their self satisfactory range due to any reasons could be FPS problem on PC having fps kinda sucks people start to be under stress and end up quitting the game and Im under that category.

7203396,0,t1_d1wxop8,I never said changing drop rates was a difficult thing in fact iirc Ive even stated the change itself is simple. It baffles me however how you think these changes are made lightly. With your background you should know better.  Ive worked multiple summers at Guerrilla Games a subsidiary of Sony and maker of the Killzone series. Not only have I plays tested their games but a couple of games from Naughty Dog as well. And the development cycle as I described was perhaps simplified but roughly the way things Ive experienced them.  The games Ive had my hands on didnt have drop rates since it werent loot based games. But the times Ive had to test things ad nauseam because the RPM of a gun was changed the time after which a grenade would explode or even something as simple as a change in the starting position no bigger then a couple of pixels are beyond my abilities to count.  When games were launched each change how insignificant it may seem to you that was planned for the next update would not only be discussed at least in five different meetings over the course of weeks it had to undergo a mandatory testing phase of at least two weeks.  One game that I cant mention due to NDA even went to a study group after every single change to see how the public would respond. Ill have to admit that it was for an IP that isnt announced yet but I could imagine Massive doing the same for TD.  For Ubisoft specific I can only talk about what Ive heard from a friend who does the same for Ubisoft Annecy mostly working on the AC series. The details may differ but the core is the same if not more extensive.  You can mock me all you want but you know as well as I do that changes like these wont be made within hrs or at least you should if its true what you say about your background.  Funny how you dodge the PXC drop rate question or are you going to say theyve lied about that too?,thedivision,d1wyvtw,-1,t5_2xiqd

7204297,0,t1_d1x264n,Structure PVP is a good idea but how they implement it can be a bad idea.  Destiny is a completely different game.  Also your PVP suggestion is no different than Destiny.  King of the Kill on the other hand is more like a fight to the finish where only  player or  team wins out of  total players.  This could be added in easily because the DZ already exists they just have to add a matchmaking tool for it some timers and decreasing radius kill zones.   After  or  minutes the area of battle will be no larger than the Left DZ extraction point.Traditional MP is not a good idea for this game.  You have to think of something outside of the box.

Whereas PvE you actually make use of the cover system and flanking it seems like PvP is always just a giant clusterfuck of people circlestrafing rolling and getting accidentally stuck against cover facing the wrong way.I have some pretty good memories of challenging missions runs with frantic last stands dashing rescues and so on.All of my memories of PvP in the DZ is as I said of forgettable circlejerking clusterfucks like the one in the video.Is it just me that feels this way?

As others on this sub say a lot DPS means nothing if you arent alive to deal any damage in the first place. Also try not to get caught up in the DPS number. It can be misleading and wildly affected by things like accuracy and reload time which pale in comparison to crit damage attributes. Mostly go out and kill enemies and figure out what feels better to you after you make tweaks to your gear. If you want to focus on dealing damage stack crit hit chance crit hit damage and headshot damage as uKillswitchAUT mentions. ,thedivision,d1xfiab,2,t5_2xiqd

I can see why some people think of Electronic builds and just say theyre weak but thats coming from assumptions that youre using any CC sticky bombs or any kind of stuff like that.Frankly if youre k SP in PvE and youre using ANY CC or any damage nukes thats when you start becoming a waste of a party slot. However I will never run in a party without a SP Buff Support.

There was an expectation for end game activities and PoE was just a what the fuck is this moment.  I agree that boss fights in this game are very much what I described but thats also the expectation.  I dont expect incursions to be like an actual raid and since they plan on releasing several of them by the time I get bored with one the next one will probably release shortly after.

Crafting and grinding is part of the RPG experience.  Nerfing crafing and then dramatically increasing HE drop rates and allowing for trading is going to flood the game with HE items and that devalues all the time those of us have put into this game grinding away to get to where we are.

It would be super hard to take two public IPs from the same subnet and make one available in the US and one available in EU. At the very least US servers should all be in their same subnet and every other region should have their own. And by that logic we should be able to block certain ranges.EDIT The more I think about it it could definitely cause issues if for example all authentication servers are located in the same subnet as EU game servers.

I did a lot of solo leveling as well and i generally avoid grouping in the Dark Zone too so I understand the sentiment but challenge modes are different in that how hard missions would scale to the amount of players challenge modes are made with four players working together in mind. ,thedivision,d1zqp2t,2,t5_2xiqd

Use it a few times and I assure you that you will never ever use ingame matchmaking again. The difference in player quality versus in game matchmaking is enormous. All these groups you hear about beating Incursions in the first hour farming Challenge modes in  mins filling your DZ stash in under an hour.....they are pretty always groups made on DivisionLFG.And case you are wondering too.....very few elitest players.

7231064,0,t3_4ehdu5,Not sure what MSG is... is it Mercy?Anyway on a normal mission set to Hard mode Id try Mercy first.  Its easily soloable though the arena floor can get hairy with them trying to flank you if you cant kill them all fast enough.  If that happens fall back to the entrance hallway.  You wont find much cover but you can finish it up easily there.  On the roof find a spot of cover in the back and stick to it as much as possible.  Be watchful of those that rush to flank you.  Its not so bad.  A little incendiary ammo on the named and easy peasy.If you still have trouble with that just keep at it and keep collecting and using that gear.  Dont worry so much about the skills just the stats at first until it becomes easier for you.  Then you can be more choosey or move to harder missions with better rewards.Youre doing OK when you can down one of those purple mobs with one magazine.,thedivision,d204a5c,1,t5_2xiqd

7234906,0,t1_d20iig0,I agree in that should Massive go this way they should make a very clear public statement of the repercussions upfront. I also agree that there are exploits and there are exploits. What I mean by this is that some are more elaborate and need you to do some series of steps before you are able to gain from it and others are what I would call glitches in the sense that it can happen to anybody even unwillingly like the mask regen.  The latter shouldnt be punishable the former however imo should. The difference is that one of them can happen unknowingly and unwillingly the other e.g. BK Police Academy etc. needs a deliberate action. If I would take BK as an example. One would be able to kill him a couple of times without realizing its the same NPC or that it isnt supposed to respawn but if the server side telemetry shows youve been killing him almost every minute while you were playing for the last two weeks it is clear you were deliberately exploiting.  You can agree with me or not but I truly believe that using and condoning exploits will damage the game and the community on the long run. Not many realize this but the changes in this update crafting  easier access to old itemsBP  higher loot drop is essentially a soft reset and my guess is that the heavy exploiting is at least one of the reasons Massive chose to implement this in this update.   I personally would like to see something like Blizzard has done against exploits. Which pretty much comes to this. If you were excessively exploiting and promoting the exploit like for example on YT or even here on reddit then you are perma banned.  . If you were excessively exploiting but was not promoting the use of the exploit than your account will be rolled back and something will be taken from you like for instance the best item in your possession  . If you have exploited to a limited degree and thus quickly stopped then you are pardoned. Since curiosity is understandable.  This system isnt perfect but it discourages the use of exploits it promotes fair play and effectively takes away the profit of using any exploit more than a couple of times for curiosity sake. This system also wont get everybody especially the promoting the exploit part can sometimes be invisible but its better than nothing. ,thedivision,d20k17e,2,t5_2xiqd

Collect all the items kill a few bosses and thats it. Something I really would like to see is an incursion to the aircraft carrier Intrepid sitting in the harbor. Its already been created and is sortof ingame. Id love to assault the stronghold go through the ship deck by deck. Pass the reactorengine room and have to deal with radiation constant DOT damage while you fight. Run along the flight deck where the only way to get through it is to use signature skills or shoot healing spells in a line infront of you so your team can heal as they run through them while you are constantly under fire. To go through the munitions depot where a wronglyplaced grenade will explode the whole ship. Go through a blackout fight in the mess hall with nothing but muzzle flashes and pulse to tell you where enemies are  maybe even add shade tech to remove or reduce the effectiveness of pulse illuminating enemies making it super difficult to target and find them. Fight your way up the tight corridors making the riot shield actually useful for the first time ever to the command deck where you fight the boss to regain control of the ship. There are so many ways and ideas they could make it amazing.THAT would be a badass mission instead of just add enemies add health. The fucking APC doesnt even move!

7252355,0,t1_d22grx9,The most common kinds of color blindness involve red and green essentially causing them to be confused for other colors not stand out as much etc.For me red really does not stand out unless its against a light colored background.For instance the grenade aoe is generally just a dark color change against the ground color.  Im mostly catching it because of that it changes generally getting darker.I manage to notice it most of the time but when I dont Im down and crawling around again.I dont generally get red and green confused unless the green is very dark then Im likely to think its brown but I do have problems with it when overlapping aoes.  I often run away from stacked green aoes because I see one area as darker and  think it might be red so I run away from it.Needless to say its very frustrating because then Im struggling with reliably handling parts of situations aoes finding red indicators etc that has nothing to do with my observation or game skills.It particularly infuriates me in this game due to the excessive amount of red used everywhere and that they put color blind modes in the game to acknowledge its an issue but done so poorly it does nothing useful.I have been thinking to find a screenshot with some grenade aoes and such and run it through here so maybe people can have a general idea of what were seeing or not seeing.

When other agents show up during a firefight check your fire and fall back some. You dont want to accidently go rogue andor catch some damage that wasnt intended for you.. You dont have to pick up your loot immediately after its dropped. If your spidey sense is tingling because of shady agents leave it and come back in a few minutes..

Although gear differences are a lot smaller in that game it seems.I think the DZ needs some work so that it becomes a better and more enjoyable experience for all and the brackets are I believe a step in the right direction. They need more brackets though.Or they could just normalize everything like many other games SWTOR casual Destiny PvP so that gear makes no difference at all. That comes with its own set of drawbacks though but personally Id be fine with that solution.In any case the DZ is hardly required in any form apart from grinding DZ ranks and Noobie Nick wont be DZ rank  anytime soon anyway.,thedivision,d23ojk9,1,t5_2xiqd

A few months go by and you look back in retrospect what was I thinking?For me at this point I think this game needs openess and clarity. There is a barrier between the playerbase and the actuall developers. Community managers are not informed developers fault or withhold information community managers fault and this is a big turnoff for me it makes me feel unappreciated and not respected. Stealth nerfs is unacceptable. The reluctance to openly discuss mechanics that appear to be broken e.g. scavenging brutal as if they dont want to reveal that they are actually not sure themself if it is working properly when it is glaringly obvious they dont. I get it its embarrasing to admit to millions of players that a mechanic isnt working properly and those who invested attributes into that wasted their time or unknowingly exploited it but they need to take responsibility for that and be open about it even to disprove our theories.TLDR openess. community managers need to remove the barrier between the playerbase and developers. withholding information and stealth nerfs are unacceptable. ,thedivision,d23t2h2,1,t5_2xiqd

You dont have to actually scam the door with the broken Mobile Cover to EXPLOIT the encounter.  I hope they wipe your accounts straight clean. Ill shed no tear. And when all you assholes leave the game ill be even more happy.  Its one thing to claim Massive are making a shitty game full of bugs and i completely agree. Knowing the issue is there and actively abusing it is just as wrong.  A company develops a software which has a bug that can be used to break into accounts easily. The company is held accountable for making the shitty software but anyone who abuses the software is also punishable.  People trying to excuse themselves by use the bugs to exploit the game are a sad and pathetic bunch i hope will soon dissapear from the game.  To them i say fuck you,thedivision,d23u0af,3,t5_2xiqd

7266651,0,t1_d2455o9,Yes everything I listed is a form of exploit by your definition of gaining an advantage. Since you are obviously dense the explosive rounds on an m HE will ALWAYS count as a head shot regardless of where you hit someone and one shot them. It works on no other rifle. No other version of the m. Playing while people are locked out you are getting the advantage of time exploiting that they cannot play because the game is broken not because they choose not to. Power leveling an alt? That alt isnt playing the game they are leveling so that they can further exploit the system by giving your main a new instance to get unlimited weekly rewards. You didnt no about that? See previous dense comment. Look at the lfg sub EVERYONE is farming this glitch. Their own PR streamers use the glitches and show it. Their own team couldnt beat it without glitching. Massive will do nothing. You can either do it to keep up or quit the game. Either way no one will care or miss you. ,thedivision,d2461jy,1,t5_2xiqd
7266686,0,t3_4exjmx,How do you roll it back fairly though? With loot sharingtrading and alt characters you cant just take away  items from players that have more than  like Ive seen a few other people suggest. I really dont think its THAT big of a deal. Fix it ASAP definitely but there are always cheeses and exploits in games like this especially shortly after new content drops. There will always always always be a group of players that find a way to exploitglitchcheese the next new piece of content and get ahead of everyone else. I think they just need to be better at testing potential issues before release and fix everything else as quickly as possible as they crop up. A roll back would almost certainly impact some players unfairly and Id much rather let a bunch of exploiters keep their gear than take something away from a deserving player.,thedivision,d2466pr,1,t5_2xiqd

7266798,0,t3_4exbb9,Yes and no. I have a firearms setup k dps and a skill power setup k dps and I stick to the firearms setup when Im running around solo. The problem with skill setups is you are  reliant on targets being pulsed to keep up with the damage a firearms build can put out. If any new targets engage you in between pulses your damage is crap comparatively. You could constantly spam headshots with caduceus to counter this but that forces you to use a weapon that isnt really designed to be a damage dealer. In groups I think everyone should have one person with high skill power. However itd be a waste to have all four people running it. Your main damage boosts smart coverpulsebooster shot dont stack and one person can easily maintain  uptime or more. Youre better off having  of the other players go high firearms to benefit from your group buffs. ,thedivision,d246n7c,1,t5_2xiqd

Then you have your subset of users with no worries about anyone getting mixed up.Ill be  honest here as a software dev at a bank..none of this has really been acceptable. The bug reeks of very poor QA since all i had to do was login and be on the wrong server. Unless the server issue was not related to code so only the production server had it. Which i suspect was the case or else wouldnt all of them have it?But even then care has to be taken so all servers are on exact setups.Communication has been crappy with only unofficial updates being somewhat timely but full of uncertainty.Telling us shortly then saying no ETA is not reassuring at all and means you were not prepared for anything like this at all.opting in allows me to choose to wait for your fix or level another character as of now i cannot do anything at all.Whats frustrating most to me is not that my character has been deleted its that the response has been the exact opposite of what id suggest you do. And that the response does not give me any choice and gives me no reason to play at all. AND to top it all off we are all getting the impression that we will not be compensated at all.

That would like quintuple the sets effectiveness. You could walk up to any DZ spawn haphazardly pound  rounds into mobs then stroll in any direction knowing you dealt up to  additional damage for the next  seconds. Thats stupid. Its called STRIKER because it rewards you for NOT employing vapid runaroundacornerandSMGsomeone Call of Duty tactics. Its not like the four sets are as simple as assault set support set sniper set solo set. Dont think of Striker as being the BATTLE or DAMAGE set. Think of it as being the assassin set. You have to be quick you have to aim well and you have to maintain control of the situation. No hipfire no extended mags RoF bullet hosing no taking bad shots.The only problem with the Strikers set bonus is that it too heavily favors SMG and LMG builds. DMRs shotguns pistols and even ARs simply cant get the buff rolling very well. I think it needs to be weighted by damage dealt so that RoF isnt so blatantly favored.,thedivision,d270lwl,0,t5_2xiqd

7310082,0,t1_d0z77ta,Better chat system to facilitate players interaction. So far we cant  You cant add people to your Uplay friend list by simple right mouse click even from character window.  There is no chat rooms. There are only some kind of location chats. Where are mess with the global chat.  Uplay is the only way to add friends from the game.  Uplay needs improvements to facilitate players interaction. Friends suggestions feature appears only after youve been in a group with other player. Why does not appear immediatelycorrect me if I am wrong but this my experience.    Clan feature. Please create a clan feature ingame. I dont want to put extra letters around my Uplay display name. Clan tag is very important. This is how people become recognized and other who are looking for group will do their best to be part of that group.  Matching is always a hot topic for any games. Let me summaries it Please consider to create DZ bracket at least for solo players. And once a solo player join in a group. Transfer to another instance. Of course its not the best solution. Would bring some frustrations if you have to load in the next  min to shift the instances. Please consider the regions that matchmaking is matching up. Better long matchmaking time than lag experience. I dont want to experience the lag of the other players. Please match players per continent. Its sounds great for a global matchmaking but when you see your bullets dealt  dmg or faterwards you see all the dmg land at once its not so great.    More flow based missions. Nonflow missions become boring much more faster than a flow missions. About the Incursion I have enjoyed more watching MarcoStyle and his friends how approach the mission. Than playing it by myself with other players. For such a mission you dont only need a group. You need to established a team. Something that has been mentioned above. With predefined roles and well coordination. Cant do so easy on the flyin a common sense.    In order to mitigate carfting effect and bring more people to DZ and fight for loot. Highend lootboss drop rate should be increased. Even developers preferring crafting than looting. As what we saw on the stream. Next time dont be an example.    XP earned after reach cap  lv. should be transfered in a later game stage. But I guess this will lead to some fast progression disbalance. So far other suggestion is to be converted in rewards. Would be nice if does not break the economy to be converted in regular credits.

We run  challenging missions nightly spend an hour or so in DZ and were just starting incursions tonight.Funniest part we all love the game and dont have issues like you see posted. All the children bitching and whining about being at endgame and nothing to do. Well I fricking wonder why? You freaking exploited the shit out of every Hornet exploit every challenge incursion exploit now youre decked out in  gear and have nothing to do? I cant imagine its because you play  hours a day and exploit and cheat the shit out of the game.The nd funniest part? I play on xb so we dont have PC hacks. DZ since incursion update has been great. Not only HE dropping from named but the absolute BEST part is confirmation just how many pussies were using the Facemask infinite healthregen exploit. I can wreck people in DZ now my team usually gets jumped and ends up slapping the other guys. Used to get beat constantly and always wondered how these people had so much health. Well because  of the guys being idiots in DZ cant handle it now because they dont have their insane healthregen cheat going. Its great DZ is a blast now.,thedivision,d2aci3w,2,t5_2xiqd

7325407,0,t3_4fn1uh,Ive been playing since day  no glitches or cheats. Hell I have no party of friends just solo and an occasional matchmaking which doesnt work for me anymore ill explain in a sec. I have created four characters. I have accumulated about a dozen set pieces but mostly crap. that said my gearscore pending on my build can go to   . Since I never glitched or cheated my way to new gear I now find myself being kicked over and over before I even get to load in incursion matchmaking groups. Ive done incursions hard before! back when my GS was in the s. and did it very well sometimes I clutched the bomb plants and kept people alive  now that everyone has cheated people just assume I suck and now i cant even get better because all the weapon blueprints worth a damn are in the dz and need rank . Ive pretty much solod since pickup groups get split up rush to their death or go rogue and get us all killedits become a thing now to kill the solo dz player in vs with their high end gearscores. Im seriously being locked out of my own game for not cheating i can no longer pve with a group or compete in pvp without gear.  massive locked me out of better weapons and gear. The clan system for this game isnt as easy as it was in Destiny. So I cant even go that route to run incursions with them to better myself. I love this game and want to keep playing but its like Massive and the community of pleb cheaters are forcing us legit casual or majority of the fanbase away from the game. I really dont see this game lasting that long if they dont find a way to balance everyone back. Even if they created a new incursion whatever people will only want higher GS people especially now that they have to do them legit. The only way is for a DLC to come out that will increase cap of  to say  with story mission gear and weapons that surpass what was exploited  blueprints and  gearscore sets,thedivision,d2auk4u,1,t5_2xiqd

What kind of gear you run is the only thing that differentiates people in this game.  So to hand someone four high ends a pop is a little over the top.

The glitch has been well publicized at this point so it skews peoples opinion of the testing that was done but that scenario is very much a corner case that a tester may not have even thought to try.I will grant you that its a bit fishy that the same glitch that has been in the game since launch made its way into the first incursion I dont know when the code freeze was initiated for Falcon Lost so it is fully possible they couldnt fix the issue or at least prevent it from becoming an issue even though they knew about it for several weeks. Regardless this is something I would think a tester should have tried before the Incursion went live and possibly even delayed the release of the Incursion while they fixed the problem or at least prevented people from being able to exploit the bug.gt If you buy a phone and theres a glitch on the phone that lets you use data for free without a plan without any hacking or third party app or anything do you really think the consumer should be held accountable for it?No the consumer should not be held accountable for this. However the circumstance you laid out has some differences than with a video game. If I exploit the phone glitch to get unlimited data that will have no direct or indirect affect on anyone else using that same phonecell company. The service provider cant hike rates because there are other competitors that offer the exact same service thus the service provider has to just accept the glitch until they implement a fix and move forward.In the case of The Division people glitching to acquire better gear has a tangible impact on the way people who arent glitching play the game. In the DZ a person with the best gear faster than they should have it can stomp players. Even if I am not getting killed by overgeared rogues I might pause before I choose to go rogue myself because I worry that the person I want to attack is severely overgeared there might be players who have better gear than me legitimately but the frequency I encounter such players is so low that I probably wont think twice about it if the glitch wasnt a thing. If Im trying to get into a PUG the group leader can be more selective with gear scores because more players have much better gear due to glitching. If as a legit player I get fed up with the state of the game I cannot leave to another offering by another company which provides the same services at the same price. I can go to other games with some of the same core concepts but nothing plays exactly the same as The Division.,thedivision,d2bmkm3,1,t5_2xiqd

You might not be allowed back in if you do so but at the same time they cant serve you slightly frozen turkey cutlets when you order steak.The Division had a great appetizer and good coffee I even sprung for the extra sides because I thought I was going to enjoy the whole meal. Then the entree came and I questioned if the chef had actually cooked it at all instead of just grabbing something out of the freezer and microwaving it until it wasnt as hard as a rock. I thought that this was just a mistake and waited for the chef to cook it again which only happened when enough customers complained. The dessert and the new entree came at the same time. The entree was something completely different than what I had been promised and when I saw the worms coming out of the dessert I decided to just leave.The difference with The Division and an actual restaurant is that with The Division you can be utter shit and completely disrespectful of your servers use cheat engine and shit like that while the servers are being utter cunts to you telling you that the way youre playing the game is just wrong and lying to you about the changes that are being done and all that happens is the servers demand you pay up front without seeing any of the food except for the prime cuts that they select because they look good and then maybe a slap on the wrist and a  day ban for when you act disrespectful to the servers.Quite frankly Im just done with Massive. I gave them a chance and I even went for the season pass bundle because they had two good betas that showed they were listening to the community. We still havent gotten to the first paid DLC and while I hope things get better it doesnt look so good from the present.

7344113,1,t3_4fxzcq,The Dark Zone is supposed to be the only area where things arent fair and you should accept this.The whole point of getting strong is to increase the gap between you and other players and looking too dangerous to mess with.Being able to check the gear score of other players before and after you fight them is a bad thing actually. Because it takes away the element of uncertainty because it allows you to determine the odds of winning the fight before firing the first shot.The sole incentive I and many others have to farm for better gear is to become overpowered in the eyes of other players. So if we are separated from those players entirely due to GS brackets then well have no need to hunt for better gear.This game is about PVP and its dangers whether you like it or not.And hardcore PVP players should not have their only incentive for progress taken away because the casuals prefer handholding even in the DZ.Im not even hardcore though but the only reason I would want to up my gear is to become too strong for the average player to kill not to be and stay equal to every player in my bracket no matter what gear score I have. I might as well go into the lv DZ bracket and minmax on purple gear if the endgame DZ gets divided.Imagine watching your favourite TV show or anime having no David vs Goliath battles anymore because theyre deemed unfair. Imagine only David vs David battles or Goliath vs Goliath battles. Imagine the former overpowered character always fighting an equally strong opponent. Imagine your favourite character realizing there is no reason for them to become stronger because if they stay lazy and get fat their enemy will just get downscaled to their level as well as the enemy getting upscaled to match their level if they spend hundreds of hours training to become stronger.,thedivision,d2cz3ws,0,t5_2xiqd

Its a bigger nerf than the other four minor ones combined yet you stupid ing rogues are so worried about protecting every little advantage you have that youre treating the whole post as equal. Debuff addressed. What revive?  I clearly state rogues should go down and stay down. Youre a rogue.  You have no real allies.  You just killed a fellow Division agent but now you think theres honor among thieves?  Its absurd.  You basically want the fellow rogues in your own party to have to leave to turn against you meanwhile the non rogue agent you killed got no such warning. You CAN extract the gear the moment you lose rogue status.  Whytf would the JTF be helping a rogue agent? Im not suggesting an increased aggro radius.

Crafting is limited by division tech that requires insane amounts of time dedication to farm that shit up. You arent even bottlenecked by normal materials anymore you dont have to extract stuff you just gotta farm bosses. And it takes FOREVER. The second is Incursions... well and you know. If it had been working by design you would take weeks upon weeks to even have a shot at getting a set you like. I mean... you cant have both systems be so difficult to grind though on a game where they probably will raise the level cap on items again next month with the next update.

7381425,0,t1_d2gyu3f,Theyre saying that the value is coded based on the assumption that for Damage taken from elites increasing its value would reduce the damage taken from elites which is correct. A higher value would result in a negative modifier to enemy damage. However the variable is probably used elsewhere in the code as protection from elites so its a positive modifier to damage resistance. So its basically adding a negative modifier when it should be a positive modifier. So changing a variable name would eliminate the confusion ,thedivision,d2h7unl,1,t5_2xiqd
7381590,0,t1_d2h72wl,Theres no meta? So PvP isnt boiled down to DPS with SMGs by stacking crit as much as possible? Skill power is a redheaded stepchild due to skill caps and the lack of skill damage modifiers like you see with weapon damage. Tanks are struggling because many skills and talents that allow tanking are broken. Theres definitely a meta and it revolves around weapon DPS. Other options exist but they dont work nearly as well as the infinitely scaling weapon damage modifiers.And Im not talking about talents that are simply underused Im talking about talents that have literally no use at max level. Talents that give you  credits for headshot kills and talents that give you bonus accolade experience have no use once you hit max level. There are plenty of skills that are also useless on a practical level minor reduction of skill cooldowns for each kill while your shortlived Signature Skill is active before it goes on cooldown for  minutes? but getting  talents to synergize on a weapon to make it work would be better than simply getting Deadly on an SMG or Balanced on an MA and wrecking though I doubt it.My point is that it doesnt hurt to have plenty of gear drop so that we have options. Were still fighting RNG to get the right stats and talents to roll so its not like everyone is going to be at their peak and have nowhere to go. However the current system starves players of top level gear to the point of it being extremely unlikely to ever get a viable drop.,thedivision,d2h8j13,1,t5_2xiqd

7382733,0,t1_d2gycn5,Think of the greatest multiplayer video games youve ever played sure there will be some that involved gamechanging unlocksgear that allowed players to be head and shoulders better than others. But now think about the rest the racing games the FPSs even the MMOs...there was a level playing field at least for the PvP elements. Most MMOs try and fail to allow PvE gear to be viable in PvP...the Division has also failed at that.The thing I always think back to is this what if the game were fun enough to not require a carrotonastick gear grind? Hey then we wouldnt be having this discussion. Is that attainable? Probably not players nowadays are conditioned to want progression. But that doesnt mean that the progression has to provide gear in incursions which makes Challenge mode missions a joke.Side comment I think one of the problems this gamemassive is having is that with so much RNG and randomness to the gear its hard to make any new gear level seem like an upgrade. They cant create a new gearlevel which is  electronics per piece because so many of the rolls wouldnt even be an upgrade. I for one would much rather a system with set values for each possible stat that could end up on a piece of gear for a given ilvl...would allow for smaller boosts per ilvl and more obvious upgrades. There would still be plenty of flavor and customization in the stats themselves instead of trashing and rerolling every single piece of gear you get.,thedivision,d2hd7n3,1,t5_2xiqd

7388419,0,t3_4gi3zz,Balancing? is it really needed? ARs with balanced and sentry absolutely rek everything over big distances where as you have to come extremely close with a SMG. Those that say ARs are weak have never played with them or are console players. I think pc amp consoles need  different balancing.  Console is like super slow paced and therefore need higher dmg.  Pc is fastpaced and might need a nerf on the gearsets. Weapons seem all fine to me except MA maybe a k dmg reduction per shot would do. Oh well i am a  sure they will fuck it up.  By the way assault rifles are better then SMGs if you know how to play. Alot of braindeads think they have to stay  meters away from their target with a assault rifle.

I enjoyed leveling to  and have done it twice so I do feel I got my initial moneys worth but the state of end game is so bad that I just dont care about playing any further. What point is there? Fight with RNG for a sidegrade just to make it easier to fight with RNG for more sidegrades? DZ is a shitshow on all platforms obviously moreso on PC.Plus the entire gameplay changes in the end game. Its no longer a tactical coverbased shooter that relies on teamwork and creative use of skills and talents.. its an NPC and grenade zergfest that obliterates the entire cover design breaks a bunch of talents and skills and rewards players with very little with an inflated almost broken loot progression system.I cant see any reason to buy future content.,thedivision,d2l9r2u,2,t5_2xiqd

My DZ farming runs only lead to me breaking down literally everything Ive extracted for crafting materials.Im finding the crafting a real pain too. Earlier on I needed  more yellow electronics material so I could craft a mask. I decided to just go running around the PVE world opening boxes but I kept getting greens and blues and it took absolutely ages to get enough to get the  yellow I needed.I realise that the game shouldnt make it easy for you to get the best gear cos if everyone has it its no longer special but Id like to see the crafting requirements tweaked and if there was a chance of really high end stuff dropping in the DZ  even if it was only a minuscule chance  I think that would be great too.

So yeah crafting not the main method to acquire gear anymore. Its just that with the crafting you can get better rolls and because of that at the endgame there is grind for mats to craft the ULTRA SUPER AUG THAT WILL KILL THE GODS etc.Before crafting changes people just rolled vector till they get brutaldeadlyfierce and did nothing more. There were no reason for them to run missions or go into dz to acquire gear. Now they kinda forced because dz give you mats and dz rank give you blueprints Incursion gives you shitty but  chance drops and missions give you starting gear.

7423251,0,t1_d2lyr5g,Trying to make Cheating and Exploiting and Cheaters and Exploiters polar definitional opposites is trying to stick a square into a circular slot you can cut the edges to make it fit but then its no longer a square and defeats the purpose. I think looking at the etymology of these words elucidates why it is difficult to apply their definitions in the context of videogames.The word cheat has a complex etymology. The french escheat originally was a legal term meaning the revision of property to the state if one died without heirs. The English shortened this to Cheat. Contempt for the Monarchy by the peasants tainted the term and related words like confiscate with negative connotations as the process was view as legalized stealing in their eyes. Subsequently cheat became used by criminals as an ironic slang term for a stolen object. Consequently the modern cheat has become obtaining an advantaged through unfair means in an arena without justice the last bit about absence of justice is important as it emphases the crime should not pay mentality loaded within the word even if the crime is legal.The word exploit also has a complicated etymology. The meaning originally evolved from unfolding to bringing out to having advantage to achievement. The confusion of modern use comes from the change in meaning of Exploitation. Originally Exploitation was a positive word for productive work however in  the word adopted a negative context due to french socialist literature particularly of Saint Simon. Subsequent usage of the word in the U.S. antislavery movement cemented the negative connotation in modern English. Funnily enough the positive meaning exploit has survived through is usage as in an escapade.So a recurring problem with using these words in the context of video games is that they can have dual positive and negative meanings. A positive meaning of cheat as where the player can deliberately circumvent game mechanics as a means to augment their play experience. A negative meaning of cheat is to use unfair means to obtain advantage over others or to circumvent the challenge of a game that is crucial to its experience. A positive meaning of exploit is where a player or players develop a creative method of solving the games problem in a unconventional way. A negative meaning of exploit is where the player by virtue of identifying weakness within game mechanics obtains means to use them as slaves to their master will. So attempting to differentiate cheating and exploiting through differentiation of intention i.e. cheaters are intentionally malicious and should be punished as per justice while exploiters are malicious but ignorant to their actions so deserve a lesser sentence  or by methodology cheaters cheat via external methods e.g. augmented or augmentation of hardware and software while exploiters use loopholes in game code or mechanics does not deal with the inherent ambiguity of good or bad meanings within these words.In my opinion the only issue is does cheatingexploiting ruin or enhance the playersplayers game experiences without harming the developer. If it enhances the experience for the player while not ruining the experience of other players or harming the developer in terms of money or reputation then let the masses cheatexploit. If the cheatexploit ruins the experience for the player and other players and harms the developer then the cheatexploit needs to be fixed.,thedivision,d2lz464,2,t5_2xiqd

7424625,0,t3_4gzplc,Ok heres how i use Tactician. dont max your skills i.e. have over k skillpower as it caps out. Its best to have around k. You want to use anything that benefits from the high level of skillpower you have. Using a flashbang sticky shock turret or something like that is useless as theyre not affected by skillpower so let someone else use those. For incursions I go with support station and pulse. For the DZ i use the BFB it wrecks especially if you use the chain reaction talent   extra damage for  or more targets and first aid. deploy your skills just after your DPS team members have started firing the  piece talent adds skillpower when your team starts dealing damage. This is the only tacticians talent that can go beyond the K skill cap. dont be the first one into a firefight unless youre confident that you can soak up some damage while your team work around you. Your job is support stay in cover as much as possible. placement of your abilities is key you want your whole team to benefit.  shotting low staminaarmour agents in the dark zone with a BFB is one of the most satisfying and fun things to do in the game. Caduceus will definitely help here but any weapon with perks that bring your skills back quicker works well. have a teammate put the triage talent on so that when they pop first aid your skills come back even quicker.,thedivision,d2m4qr2,2,t5_2xiqd

7425530,0,t1_d2ltisn,Well after looking over your build I can tell you what I would want to change if it were my character. I think you have dumped way too much into firearms and lost a lot of surviveability. You really want to get your armor up to  as that is the maximum  damage mitigation. I have under  firearms and I get over k dps from my aug. I have the sentry set though. I would consider raising your stamina by  minimum go from firearms to stamina on something if not for surviveability then for unlocking weapon talents. Specific Gear changes Ditch the nomad gloves. You really want a pair of gloves with the talent Savage which increases critical hit chance against targets outside of cover by x. For me I believe it is . Even a GS  could be much better. On that note for your  major attributes you want crit chance crit damage and smg damage. This will hugely increase your dps. Personally I dont think I will ever use set piece gloves as they have no talent and the glove talents strongly complement DPS. Second thing to go is that chest piece. As far as I know your armor still caps at  even with the talent so you are really losing out on what could be a better talent. If you want to get the damage and survivability that most people have currently you really want a chest piece with Reckless as the talent. It is currently broken where it gives you  All Weapon Damage AND  All Damage Resistance. Knee Pads can get a high Crit damage this helps a lot. Mods Gear mods I would say do whatever to get your armor maxed out then do whatever fits your play style.The biggest change on your SMG that will greatly increase your DPS is your magazine. I personally run with Magazine size and Rate of fire. It boosts my dps by over K compared to other magazine types.Overall you have a pretty good build for your GS but there is always room to get better!Edit And if you do want to keep your firearms that high get and AUG or Vector as they will have much higher damage for you. This is because of how the weapon damage scales up with your firearms. Each weapon has a hidden damage multiplier the aug and vector scale up by . for each point of firearms while the mp only scales up . for each point of firearms. It can be confusing hope this helps  ,thedivision,d2m8gjf,1,t5_2xiqd

If every  mob dropped  at least in the  bracket I think youd see players on a much more even playing field with all of that great diversity of stats talents and rolls that everyone loves.To be clear I do not love the great diversity of rolls I would prefer that every item available had specific stat values allowed when it drops you know you got the best one that could drop and only need to worry about recalibrating if you need different stats or talents. You would know its roughly balanced against all other weaponsitems of that level within reason.The diversity of stats themselves is ok although Id like it trimmed down a bit. Same with the talents. I do like how it allows for different builds to be put together. The rolls  electronics vs  electronics dont allow for anything other than being an invisible wall for the player.,thedivision,d2mdwlw,2,t5_2xiqd
7426881,0,t3_4gyp7v,I feel like this stance on exploits is bullshit. It shouldnt be my responsibility to check your Facebook page to see if I can do something. Drop rates are abysmal. What does end up dropping is generally useless. Crafting has been broken by recent changes to the economy. I dont have time to farm like a  year old with no job and nowhere to be. If I want to be able to hold my own against shotgunrushers I need a way to get a reasonable return on my investment of time. If you dont like exploits Massive then fix the exploits dont threaten your customer. Its like going to a restaurant and getting a single packet of ketchup.

7434289,0,t1_d2n26di,Yeah hitman has its issues such as the way you unlock weapons and the online component. You get points for doing certain actions in the mission get so many points you go up a level for that particular map and every level you unlock a weapon a new insertion point a new place to smuggle things to. However if you go offline then you cannot unlock anything nor can you access anything you have unlocked previously. Cue many angry threads on reddit.Underneath all that is the hitman game weve all been waiting for well minus the sniper briefcase which accounts for the other half of salty posts.Personally I kind of dont mind the episodic release it gives them opportunity to hear whats working and what isnt and tweak the game a little and the maps are quite large I probably wouldnt get to see half of what they have to offer if I was rushing through trying to see what happens.And instead of the one or two sweet spots the older games had this one generally has several.All in all though there probably isnt enough there to keep you entertained exclusively.,thedivision,d2n8c4w,2,t5_2xiqd

That makes little sense to me. Green and blue tech is more important for lower level players. If youre in the  DZ zone you dont need blue or green tech. Ever. Deconstructing will always be a superior method of material gathering because of the exchange rate.And its quite clear that theyre trying to create a newer improved loot system that is not about catering to spoiled children but rather about amassing tons of highend drops and then being able to pick and choose upgrades from those mass piles of yellows as opposed to everyone dropping stacks of tech on blueprint crafting.If theres something to pick apart about their proposed changes I certainly dont think its the absence of green and blue tech from DZ . And green tech is utterly worthless at its exchange rate. I find your argument unconvincing.

If you have  Sentry with a decent SMG  sniper rifle with full consumables can carry on your own.  On the roof once even if its just you who runs left after clearing the sniper and the rifleman climbing up on that small platform gives cover and lots of room to kill things.  The first group in the basement you can snipe at least one of the shotgunners from the big open door closest to them. If you cant shoot them from any angle just fire once and throw a tear gasfire grenade in front of you. Once the last guy is about to die throw some CC in the far right corner then another CC in front of the next doorshoot the gas canisters. ,thedivision,d2t08lu,1,t5_2xiqd

Then I saved enough and bought the Nomad holster from the DZ vendor so I have that  piece.Now depending on what I am doing I switch my gear up.  For FL I run the  piece tactician and play healercounter sniper.for challenge mode dailies and DZ solo I run my  piece Sentry Call with various other stuff depending on my mood.For DZ group I run  piece nomad with various other stuff.

Say what you want about about disliking the change but this issue is the same as bullet king to the devs. Its a part of the game that isnt doing what they intend it to it was providing players x as much HE loot as was intended. x as much HE loot means x better chance of getting a useful item. As much as that seems like a good thing getting an upgrade every single run isnt necessarily a good thing. In the short term it makes the game more enjoyable Hey look at this god roll  AUG I just got High damage high base crit Brutal Deadly Selfpreserved. With that gun in hand theres one less slot youre looking for an upgrade in one less slot for you to get excited about when an item drops. The main way to make a loot based game exciting is through gear progression. Giving out all the best gear on day one means the game wont last very long.No one in UbiMassive will actually say it but their jobs right now are to keep you interested and coming back to the division until they start selling the expansion DLC. They do that through making the game engaging but also through not giving you all the best gear on day one.

7525303,1,t3_4ifcfk,Im starting to think the answer is in the DZ checkpoints... Make that a location where you can decide if the DZ will allow PVP or not. If the player marks themselves as flagged for PVP then they will enter a DZ instance that allows PVP. If the player does not flag themselves for PVP they will enter the DZ in an instance that does not allow dmg to other players. It basically allows the player to decide if they want to engage in pvp.Of course the other option here would be to make the area outside of the DZ useful at level  which I think they intend to do. Which btw I think is great because Im a solo player  of the time and I rarely bother with the DZ any more simply because the riskreward isnt worth the effort more often than not this could change as well now that we have a chance to see gear with a GS high enough that it might be an upgrade. ,thedivision,d2xl8j3,2,t5_2xiqd

7568342,0,t1_d32gsdi,Well Im not much of a Borderlands fan the first one was alright but the other ones were pretty meh  in particular only had the lolsorandom characters going for it but the story itself was lackluster at best.Also the guns in Borderlands  drove me insane once it gave me the perfect weapons I wanted then I leveled up a bit and those weapons became useless.Hooray for having to use guns that explode upon reloading for that useless extra damage that took a whooping  off an standart enemys health bar and a rocket launcheramppistol combo because that was all I found...At any rate I should probably reiterate that I dont really care about having that  performance boost to compete with those that do.Hence why I havent even touched Falcon Lost on challenging yet.I play The Division  hrs by now because I love the gun play... no clue why but the guns feel meaty and fun to shoot despite it being a rd person shooter and the enemies being giantic pixel piles of health and armor.The atmosphere during and between battles adds a lot to the game and feels dare I say perfect.Explosions here dust there radio chatter Yeah yeah SMALL ARMS FIRE!!!!!elf P amazing ragdolls and oh sweet caking hell these death animations are awesome!Remember the hanging JTF corpses around LMB strongholds?Well I always tend to clean my debts.However the core issues in The Division are way too large to be overlooked. is a rating Id give to a great game that didnt do anything major wrong.Few examples Witcher  CampC Red Alert  Sins of a Solar Empire Master of Orion  Doom  Darkest Dungeon WoW Classic and BC although the game wasnt great at releaseAnd I gotta be honest Ive never in all of my life Which isnt long considering my youth felt like there was a  game. would be the perfect game without the possibility of adding or changing anything but so far Ive always found one or two things in a game that couldve been improved in one way or another.Take Diablo II for example great game still a viable source of entertainment in  despite its age.However theres a lot to be said about its AI Enemy and friendly skill trees basically coming down to These abilities are a must and thus skilling into them is too and other issues.Thats mostly because I differentiate between emotional and factual planes. Or so Id like to thinkThe point of doing so is to attempt to have a mostly neutral look at a game Im playing because lets face it a game can be horrendously bug ridden and bad gameplay wise but it can still be fun even if the game is Big Rigs and its only fun for the sake of witnessing the utter self deconstruction with a couple friends and potential alcoholic beverages.The Division is a fun game and if that was the only thing Id take into consideration it would be an easy  for me but looking at it from a technical point of view its flaws are huge.Am I still recommending my friends to buy it?

So here is my solutionWhen leader votes to kick someone first a queue is generated that grabs a player in matchmaking.  Once that player is in the queue the other members of the team can vote to kick and replace with the player in the queue.  That way its not really a kick but its a swap.  This should work no matter where you are even in no respawning areas like the incursion.

7573187,0,t1_d330n42,No. Steam charts is strictly for Steam tracking of users. However I still find it weird that people want to cling to the idea that because it only represents Steam that it in no way reflects a larger trend which is a ludicrous assumption to make. Barring those who for whatever reason may be opening it through Uplay now instead of through the Steam overlay seeing such a massive drop and expecting it to ONLY be reflected on that one medium is an insane leap to make one that smacks of desperation. Not that youre making that claim just that the leading line of questioning you did make oft ends up with that type of snarky commenting.Whats probably valid to say however is that the console variants might not have had as large a dropoff in player base but until hard numbers are actually available its difficult to say one way or another but if I were to be wagering Id still place money on the idea that all platforms have experienced nonnegligible drops in players across the board from its start.I dont care if the game succeeds or fails. Im not enjoying it anymore but Id like to enjoy it again. Im only annoyed by this strange rhetoric that seems to be going around that anyone that criticizes it is a whiny teenager and the rather poor reasoning that  Steam users would somehow not be directly relatable to other platforms.,thedivision,d33190e,13,t5_2xiqd

7608361,0,t1_d370ufj,gt In a game where you burst people down before they even have a chance to reactThat doesnt happen unless you literally let somebody walk up to you and shoot you in the face multiple times. Which is preventable in the majority of cases by simply being aware. With decent gear  armor k health that doesnt happen unless you fuck up.gt even that isnt enough to stop the onslaught of sentrys and smgsSentry is being nerfed already. SMGs arent going to get nerfed by this in fact they are going to get buffed which you would have realized if you would watch the video properly. gt The fact that you think that skills and talents work as defense just shows you dont understand how deep the problem goes with the game and what actually contributes to the defense issues in it.Actually it shows that I dont just condemn everything by making a general statement like THERE IS NO DEFENSE IN THE GAME. There is clearly balance issues which I already pointed out and so did the video OP posted but that doesnt mean you can just ignore talents and say the only defense anyone has is survivor link. Because that is factually wrong and makes  sense.But when somebody downvotes comments because they have a different opinion then the whole argument is already pointless.

I think many people are having kneejerk reactions and not taking into account the big picture in terms of DZ combat and the howwhen its taking place. Seriously as someone that doesnt roll in a group of  often I think its still an awesome idea to have to defend your loot.The game is missing the fighting that revolves around extractions.I know that fights happen at extractions often but the current window of jacking someone on the rope is tiny a few secs? and almost all fights happen either before the rope is in play or a second after thus making it a normal fight where there happens to be a helicopter above you.As of now groups of  wouldbe rogues hit the agents wanting to extract before they get their loot on the rope because the window to kill them while on the rope is short. With rope cutting the fights might be more fair since one rogue will be going after the loots while the other  fight. If you are a group of  then you are now a man up in terms of agents firing guns and one of their targets is standing still.So there you have it. There is more fighting that will happen at and around extractions not because there are solely players there but because now loot matters. This creates a higher gap between the ups and downs the high tension low tension that this game does well  the thing that separates it from almost every other game to come to market.,thedivision,d39y4ye,1,t5_2xiqd

This is more similar to the damage output that is reachable with Striker .  With Striker  you get to the  and each bullet does  more damage.  With this set you need to hit  times to get that boost.

If they wouldve just created a complete ripoff of D for example people would complain about that too. People arent happy if they have nothing to complain. They always find something.

Something extra for those who want it that would still require effort for those who want it but arent required for those who dont. Like a boss level fight with his minions and whatnot that could be accomplished after the primary boss was taken down. Wouldnt even have to drop any loot since youd be getting access to extra items that might prove useful.

I didnt say I thought it should be easy and I didnt say I should be able to easily solo challenge missions.  Im not upset about it either  like you I knowingly took a risk and it didnt pay off.  My only loss was  minutes of time to earn the Intel Points.  Its really not a big deal.Im aware that it said Group Recommended but it also said GS recommended  those two things dont really jive in my book.  If its really only GS then I probably dont need  people if Im GS.  If I need  people its probably not going to go well with x GSs.  In fact Id hazard a guess that  GS players would have a really hard time completing one of the two harder HVTs.Massive also played the incursion up to be super difficult and it was nowhere near the difficulty they implied so youll have to forgive me if I was curious to see if these were similar.  Im still not convinced that they have completely worked out how to calculate their recommend gearscore  as evidenced by the fact that they changed the recommendation for FL without changing the event itself.tldr  you did the exact same thing I did so Im really not sure what youre trying to accomplish by berating my equally bad choices.EDIT  meant to add  have fun out there!  and if youre on XB lets team up and do one of these damn HVTs!,thedivision,d3i3buy,1,t5_2xiqd

Nothing else.gtI think the autoaim addition to PC weeks back shows their primary focus for the Division console.How do you get to that conclusion?gtIm saying they nedd to have a standard across the board and that doesnt include favoring one platform over another when it comes to issues that plague both.What are you on about?

7757704,0,t1_d3nz3gn,Because it straight up feels trashy using it.  Like its one thing when your in a group.  With our group our skill build has a maxed out smart cover.  We were rogue for an hour straight running nothing but smart cover pulse and seeker mine.  No ults had  to be popped nothing.  But I mean I see way to many people abusing shock turrets on console.  When you have two shock turrets or more in a group thats bad.  Yeah you can take out one shock turret by yourself.  But when they pop two sorry friend your not going to be able to take out two before you get shocked.  Obviously Im aware of my surroundings and dont run into the shock turret like an idiot.  But console players are abusing the shock turrets like crazy.  The people who defend them are the ones who normally abuse them.  Console has no hotkey for candy bar.  Not to mention you cant use a medkit or shoot after getting unshocked..  That needs to be fixed immediately.  My build is kkk no accuracy mods booster vigorous mitigation.  So my builds not bad I mean when I can tank the hell out of everything players throw at me half the time I would say my builds pretty damn good.  Hell I asked why a group of  had to run  shock turrets on  guy.  Their reasoning well your to damn tanky and do a shit ton of damage as well so we had to shock you so your a sitting duck.  Thats when you know its a crutch.  Not stating that it should only be about DPS. It should be a tactical game with multiple variations of builds.  But to state that running multiple shock turrets is tactics is beyond my understanding.  Their is no tactics to it.  Its abusing something that is broken to say the least.  Shock a target shoot sitting duck in the head get melted instantly because said user cant use a medkit or shoot after getting shocked.  Everyone that use to have team battles in the darkzone automatically said no shocks no ults no special ammo.  Now why do you think that is?  Its not because they couldnt use them.  But it takes out any skill in the game and the only reason you would have died is because of the shock turret and being a sitting duck.  ,thedivision,d3nzpru,-1,t5_2xiqd

If it is good or an upgrade then why grind the current patch until the DLC drops for your platform.  From my experience.  The worse time for a MMOgame with progression is a month before the content patch when people take a break and come back a week before or when the new content launches.

If you use the Lone Star fourpiece to reload for you while in the radius of the ammo support station it still takes from your ammo pool.

Also move to a good smg with decent rolls. This will bump up your DPS. So how do you get all of this?  Honestly IMO farming the  incursions is the fastest way. Falcon Lost will drop you the striker and sentry gear often.    Both incursions are a grassy way to farm for  weapons.

7780696,0,t1_d3qjzr0,Shotguns really are not great in pve because you need to get so close to use them plus the dps isnt going to be great. I have been running a double shotgun lone star build for fun but it is really hard. I would recommend two smgs or an smg and assult rifle for pve. Shotguns really shine in pvp. I have had the most luck with a shotgun smg lone star build. But double shotgun can be fun too.As far as the shotguns themself go I would recommend the super  rolled with as many damage increases as possible. Since you can reload the shotgun just by switching weapons the fire rate of the super  is really nice and you can fire off shots without worrying too much about missing shots. Also for double shotgun I have had the best luck running a super  with damage increases and an m with fire rate plus damage.Edit Another thing I have found while using lone star is that magazine size for shotguns doesnt matter as much as it would with other sets. I usually run magazines with crit change and weapon damage or weapon damage plus fire rate.,thedivision,d3qlmoy,7,t5_2xiqd

If you start the mission before every player has loaded in they wont be able to enter the mission area.With Falcon Lost you can go to the start point of the mission set your privacy to open choose the difficulty then cross the mission start line and hang around waiting above ground until you get a full squad. You cant do that with the new incursion.The only way to start it and be  sure of being the leader is to go to the start of the mission in your own instance then invite  other players to join you then start it once all of the players are there ready to go.On the Xbox One what Ive been doing with randoms is inviting them to a party then I leave the squad go to the start of the mission then I can use the Invite party to game option to bring all  players to me. That way we can all cross the start line and nobody gets repeatedly teleported back.I hope Massive do something to address this cos it sucks.

If I can suggest one tactic for the solo extraction wait until theres no more than  seconds left before the rope goes up and drop a shock turret after you place your loot.

Sentry stacks should because damage cap is calculated BEFORE the stacks because the stacks are individualized. While I have not tested it I am confident in my answer from a pure logic standpoint and that it is how other hard caps work. For example the minimum cool down for the heal skill is  seconds but this minimum is calculated BEFORE skill haste which has been tested and can reduce your cool downs to below the hard cap.,thedivision,d3trjue,1,t5_2xiqd

Also when you hit your half HP threshold against someone who doesnt chunk your health in bullets him you should shoot your heal on the floor and strafe in and out of it while shooting him.

I went balanced so I could run an effective overheal and pulse increasing my crit chance at full health and increasing my damage with the pulse  maximizing the utility of the bleed function. Since the bleed has a crowd controllike function in PvP I find a flash sticky to be an effective skill to run along side it as well. Bleeding while blind is annoying and enviro sting. As a utility it works well even without a high damage output but it only gets better if you build for it. But you may as well build to increase the bleed damage if you can  SMG damage on your gloves. I bleed agents for as much as k sometimes and with an MPMPConcerted with ROF and magazine size you can tag rogies on the run with minimal time spent stopping in order to apply the tag. Id suggest using it in a team when your session goals are to hunt rogies. Its good for PvE in the sense you can learn how far you need to take an NPC down before you can switch targets and let the bleed do its work. I was surprised with how well it faired in this way since I didnt take into account how much the bleed would boost of you have a completely maxed tacticianpulse behind you.  against s I tend to land a few head shots with my ma then finish the  shots with an SMG in order to reach towards a higher bleed. Once the armor has been torn through it really hits as hard as youd hope.,thedivision,d3x78gj,1,t5_2xiqd

They wont move if you tell them to they wont ever leave that cover  theyll just shoot the mobs until they die. Use a signature skill.  Not even if you spend  minutes telling them to over a mic.  They wont use it at any point.  Ive been matched with players who despite having mics  legitimately could not be bothered to step away from a riveting conversation long enough to notice I have been repeating the line Can you please use your sig verbatim for over  minutes. Shoot the ammo bag on heavies.  They wont do it  not because they wont leave cover to get vantage which they wont do either they just dont seem to aim for it.  In fact they seem to prefer body shots  seeker mine explosives with sub k skillpowersick cooldowns. Use a mic.  Which is okay.  If you back me up in some minor way or demonstrate experience with the mission.  Usually they wont do either and just get surrounded by mobs and die while I run fuse boxes and drop heaviessnipersshotgunners  while rubbing the sweat off my brow.  No worries they have sigs they wont use. Kill snipers.  Rarely do I see players acknowledge snipers.  They seem to think because they are far away they arent a threat. Stay alive.

7846658,0,t1_d3xpu2g,Factor in cooldown and your second ability then youll see why this would make just about every encounter trivial. That and the talent that increases explosive damage when used against multiple targets would make everything a joke. Nobody would build into health if they can infinitely overheal there would be no need. Not to mention signature skill cooldown which also scales with skill power. The point is if people could raise skill power to their numerical limitations there would be no need to allocate to other areas it would be trivial. Survival link up almost all the time with overheal up all the time will make you fairly tanky with minimal stamina   and infinite sticky bombs pretty much negates the need for firearms. Also the comparison to sniper crit headshots is not really fair since you  have to hit a target in the head  movement thus lag is more of a factor with headshots with a sniper  cover is a factor with landing headshots cover isnt much of a hindrance with sticky bombs just shoot it behind  you actually have to have a little bit of luck to proc the crit. With sticky bombs you are pretty iChat guaranteed that damage as aim does not necessarily have to be precise though lag can foul it up.,thedivision,d3y17fx,0,t5_2xiqd

You seem pretty well geared as long as you can find the right team to run it with. Just take it slow in the middle and play pretty defensively as uJohnnyKay suggests as its the best method to do it. The only thing Id add is someone possibly running the ammo crate support station in addition to another person running immunizer support station so you dont have to use the restock crates often.

7881763,0,t1_d41ywth,Youre absolutely right.  Ive never fired the UMP or the Vector.  But honestly it doesnt sound like you have a whole lot of experience with weapons in real life with how you talk about guns.You bring up the manstopper myth of the .ACP.  Yeah a . is a bigger heavier round and can and often will do more damage to flesh than a mm will.  But the one shot kill personification of the . is untrue the .ACP has difficulties with penetration especially against Kevlar or plates and at best youre gonna wind someone wearing anything II rated or better.  The hotter MM loads fair slightly better against Kevlar but will also be stopped by most plates.Also dragging the AK into a discussion about two SMGs is mostly irrelevant but since you brought it up Ill expound on it.  Yeah the AK is a battlehardened veteran that has earned its reputation of shooting every time you pull the trigger without fail.  But having shot my fair share of AK and ARM style rifles I will take an M every day of the week.  I can put more rounds on target faster with the M I can easily attach an optic or grip to further improve the weapons usability and so long as I dont completely neglect the M she will reliably shoot for me.  Ive never once had a stoppage with a weapon Ive had assigned to me because I keep it clean.To me this argument echoes the MM arguments of the s.  Back then the M was brand new and had not been tested for a number of defects it was found to have and was despised by soldiers for its failures.  The MA solved a number of these issues and while it still has its detractors its difficult to find a weapon that consistently outperforms the AR platform for its price.  The Vector is still being tested there are some kinks that need to be worked out but the technology is sound and certainly an improvement over the antiquated UMP.rant,thedivision,d41zf4j,1,t5_2xiqd

PvP is getting boring for me with rogues being essentially immune to sticky bombs and all running shock turrets Im wishing I had  shock resistance on Final Measure as I slowly convert from a sticky build to a DPS build.The games seems to become more one dimensional as we go. Nerfing crit means not running pulse in most cases as a SP build. ARs and LMGs suck compared to SMGs and nothings changed in mo. Shotguns are usually lackluster. Builds arent punished for not investing in sp they just run CC abilities like shock turret or flashbang. Ability caps and progression with sp suck.PvP has become either rogues steamrolling servers or bunkering down and either surviving as they slaughter the masses or being overwhelmed by the entire server rushing them.

7945385,0,t1_d4938qd,Because it takes hundreds of hours of gear farming and invalidates it to add another hundreds of hours requirement for new and maybe even the same meta gear simply because of the character level increase.  Why have a leveling process of  hours for an expansion level cap increase and lose  hours of your prior process to do another  hours?  Why not just skip that  hours of artificial progression?Losing a couple hundred hours of progression is far from minor in my eyes.  gt anything that empowers the player to choose how they want to play. You can always make new characters and level them  if you love the leveling experience.  I dont see how making a disadvantage and forcing others to do it is an empowers the player to choose how they want to play when they might not enjoy the leveling process.,thedivision,d494w77,1,t5_2xiqd

7950278,0,t1_d49knj8,Im really happy running with a pc Sentry pc Striker build with a SMG amp shotgun.  Sometimes Ill swap out the  piece for Predator  more range or Final Measure  Exotic dmg resist if Im in DZ.  Extra range on the shotgun is nice to proc Sentry from really far away  youre practically guaranteed to get headshots and can fire off  really quickly to get all your marks stacked.  I wonder if Destructive  increased armor dmg will also stack with the new  AR armor shred and the  from Strikers.  fasta is really easy to achieve with any build.  Might be enough to swap one of my favorite Black Market AKs in place of the SMG.Assuming it all stacks Id be doing  more headshot damage and shredding AI armor  faster its additive Im guessing? so long as Im using an AR.  Once their armor is gone the fight is over.  Not sure why SkillUp was talking  haha.  Its usually milliseconds.  And if I dont completely finish them off with the SMGAR swap to pistol for the  execute dmg and then get three shots off on the next target to prepare the Sentrys.  Obviously Id prefer it affected players too but theres a big advantage in being able to kill AI faster than the people trying to kill you that also have AI killing them.  pc Striker Sentry gloves and a VigorousReckless chest or a RejuvenatedTenacious mask might be pretty good this next patch.  Or pc Lone Star and some dirty shotgunlmg combos.As for LMGs Im excited.  I really enjoy the Hungry Hog especially when meticulous procs and I brought a ton of ammo with me.

8018155,0,t1_d4h9s4z,That would only work if DZ rank was tied to PvP and it might actually make it worse since you could have a top tier geared player in the lowest DZ rank. And youd still get people working the system  great gear create alts or die a lot to keep their DZ rank down.Im rank  with having run down one  sec timer and killed  rogues. Just because Ive spent a lot of timeground out in the DZ doesnt mean Im a good or interested PvP player.DZ rank means only that you have spent a lot of time in the DZ either grinding against mobs or a little less time going rogue a lot successfully. Just like GS  just means that your gear pieces have the potential to outroll or be more powerful than lower GS. Neither metric is a good one alone for creating brackets. A combination might be better.But really the only metric I can think of that might truly work is player kills. That would quickly separate out those who PvP for the PvP of it and those who dont as well as skill level of players. Its also a stat you cant screw with unless you create new characters and level them all the time.

I think if youre killed by a rogue you shouldnt be punished for it because like you said in most cases its only you against a group of  rogues and very rarely that plays out in the favor of the single player.  So as it stands now youre being punished for what turn out to be unwinnable odds in most cases.  Same goes for going rogue or atleast rank  I believe the keyloot the players drop should be reward enough.  Manhunt though I think should reward creditsexp since youre running off what usually ends up being a  minute timer.,thedivision,d4jdo1s,0,t5_2xiqd

You can use x but its fixed stat is extra headshot xp which is generally useless at that point. For ARs Ive been running the red dots though it used to be ACOGs for me.And no right now you cant craft anything but the x. There are no x or x blueprints.

Its trash.People who run it think its worth it to give up all the extra damage modifiers from SentrysStrikers all of which completely outscale the pc Lone Star bonus just for the sake of no reload are kidding themselves.In PvP worthless because youll be shooting a BB gun. The new innates added to LMGs and shotguns apply to all the sets. Id rather wear the pc Sentry and a Reckless chest and destroy people with a shotgun since the innate goes for everybody.In PvE  of it is done with a MA anyway. Besides its not like not having to reload is a good thing against mobs who force you into cover because they absolutely destroy you even with k HP and  mitigation.Lone Star is good for restocks and thats it.,thedivision,d4npnxp,2,t5_2xiqd
8075078,0,t1_d4nmzs5,In fairness the Vex Mythoclasts first incarnation was so ridiculously overpowered that using anything else was foolish if you were one of the few who had access to the weapon.Ditto for most of the game re the Vision of Confluence or the Fatebringer which were brutally overpowered primary weapons that did important damage types which you could otherwise get nowhere else in the game.VoC remains one of the bestfeeling scout rifles out there despite the fact that they have not brought it forward and Fatebringer was just a fullon endgame weapon... not to mention the Gjallarhorn.Its not a question of not wanting folks to have fun.  Its a question of not having a single weapon which is the clear correct choice among a sea of other weapons which are ostensibly in the same weight class.  Got a shotgun?  If its not a Matador or a Party Crasher its garbage.  Got a pistol?  If its not Thorn or Hawkmoon its garbage.Clearlycorrect choices and perfect builds are a bad thing.  They make all aspects of player choice essentially illusory there should be good reason to use a wide spread of different items and one item should never be a superior choice in multiple categories.,thedivision,d4npqjs,2,t5_2xiqd

8078560,0,t1_d4o1j5j,I agree with having them trigger sentry.  I would even go further.  Scar H variants come from MMR to the AR class reworked of course in terms of dmg.   I would make it so that scar h and FAL variants all trigger sentry mark.  And I would straight up drop the friggin shotgun triggering it even though I love it.  This makes the most sense to me as the sentry is suppose to be the marksmen set and now the weapon with the shortest optimal range is one of the most effective. On a side note just a little brag that will probably be out done but with a good TA pulse and  marks I can get my pistol to crit for k when mobs are at low health.

As a heavy Destiny PvP player not having the Hawkmoon during its prime is an absolute travesty to Xbox players. It was hands down the most dominant gun in the right hands.

Im sitting at just shy of  hours in the game and would probably easily be at  if I hadnt decided that the DZ shitshow wasnt worth it for so many reasons. During this time even before I gave up on the DZ I only ever went rogue on accident and when I did I apologized. I completely understand and recognize that many of the assholes out there will get over geared and torment other players. This is a fact of life in any of these games that have a Day ZSurvival of the fittest type PVP environment. In Ark you have alpha tribes locking down servers here its  man gank squads running reclaimertanktician builds hell the fact they have  assholes ganging up on people is enough without degenerate strategies  The kind of people who do enjoy tormenting weaker people will do this regardless of any PVE imbalance. I completely agree that bugs shouldnt be in any game but we also have to understand they will occur. Expecting the devs to make a full stop and completely pull an item out of the game because it has some bugs will lead them to be less adventurous with their new additions  in the future. The more cautious they are the crappier the gear will get for everyone. ,thedivision,d4w052w,1,t5_2xiqd

Because of this I could solo all of the challenge missions with my  gearscore set. It was pretty minmaxed because all drops I would get would be at or below the stuff I had on.

8163794,0,t1_d4xznkb,Yes but I dont play PC games so no comparison to offer. Aiming is objectively awful but that is to be expected and my aim is I think bad as it is. Youll have to weigh the pros and cons yourself regarding the investment including the time spent to level up but yeah I dig it.Few of my friends played the game to begin with but my brother and I play frequently and we havent bothered with the DZ since . except a couple very brief and thankfully uneventful soires. Because there are only two of us and we arent interested in running with randoms in that environment if at all we have just stayed out and geared up through the alternative methods I outlined in my TL comment. Two other friends IRL play but one is really casual and apparently more interested in other games his availability is also generally incompatible with mine and the other only just returned after cheesing FL back in the day and his build is awful but he bought UG and I helped him gear up to .Well see how long I last  I actually busted out Destiny when . was released because I couldnt log in I bought but didnt play it so I was only level  or something  but for now I am enjoying myself and I am probably plenty geared up to start tackling challenging incursions or heroic anything honestly I havent done more than hard incursions  two or three times each for FL and CS  and one successful challenging UG operation.I get the feeling that console aim makes the higher difficulties really punishing and I am annoyed that I cant seem to solo challenging missions or hard incursions which is weird because I manned my first challenging mission while only GSish and Im reticent to blame my skill or lack thereof as opposed to the potato aim...

8166406,0,t3_4r0n3o,the biggest issue is that this is a cover shooter where you will die quickly in pve if you play the game how the devs want you to. Enemies will sponge the shit out of your weapons and ignore cover to quickly kill you while the few that dont rush will spam with grenades that force you to move.Meanwhile you cannot survive more than half a second out of cover against these endgame level enemies. and for PvP only idiots use cover as toughness actually works which leads to players constantly rolling around and failing to kill each other unless someone screws up or everyone teamfires a single person. ,thedivision,d4ycm2n,1,t5_2xiqd

8187532,0,t3_4rg33p,Its an RPG we get it but who would like to grind an RPG with little means to customize your gears? The lack of sense of progress is just baffling. From which example would you see character levels rises so quickly to max level with no obvious attribute boosts and NPCs have spikes in HP and AC that PCs cannot catch up with? I have little nice things to say about the end game contents because the end game plays differently to what we are used to in the preendgame contents. Gears that we had in preendgame complements the characters fairly well and NPCs can be kill within reasonable time. End game gears are most of the time inadequate for the slaying of NPCs. Nobody wants to attack the same NPC to ad nauseam before moving on to the next one to rinse and repeat. Some of us have a lot of time on their hands some of us dont. We simply do not enjoy spending significant amount of our precious free time and not to experience a sense of progress. That feel of getting stronger each day is one of the fat juicy carrots that make fans coming back for more.If the Division is a true breed RPG that wants to cater the RPG aspects the dev should have spent more time on designing skills that actually make an impact in gameplay. The gear attributes have to be reworked to allow full customizations finer brackets have to be posed in the DZ and people should be allowed to choose DZ brackets as well. If you wanna solo you could select a lower bracket and to be hindered by xp and gs penalties. If you wanna hunt for big xps and better gears you could select a higher bracket and team up with friends. No one likes to grind the same farming route in Dz  for  months on ends. Having Korean styled grindy NPCs that are unfairly hard is just bad design.Economy has to be relaid as well what kind of RPG introduces  kinds of currencies that constantly find new uses? This reeks of adhoc decision making to cover  pots with  lids. Whoever held the budget in game design and whoever pushed the game out the door are responsible for this RPG. People would have been happier if they only released the main story portion of the game and use extra time to make end game contents work. We basically paid the full damn price and some more to play test for them. The main story should have been a paid demo priced at a lower price point. Why? Because you can advance  levels in less than a days play time and you would tend be hurled into the ugly world thats the end game.Telling people to play this game as an RPG in the current state is a big fat slap across everyones face.edit corrected some typos,thedivision,d50zrf1,0,t5_2xiqd

I think they need to add more options the more you reroll and keep the cost increase how it is. like for instance you want to reroll armor and there are  more options and you reroll and you get  options and none of them were armorthen the next reroll should give you  options instead and the next reroll  and on and on.,thedivision,d512cch,1,t5_2xiqd
8188703,0,t3_4rg7xj,One of the biggest things that needs to g is on kill effects unless very powerful. Diablo and WoW at one time both had on kill effects and were summarily dropped due their lack of effect on fights that were not full of trash to. Ie Boss fights. Most of these effects were set to a stiackingbuffdebuff that once were reached triggered the effect. For one example. Fire Crests  piece requires killing a mob on fire to incendiary ammo effect. I would suggest it be activated by a stacking buff that requires say hits to trigger the effect. The number is just an example and would need tweaking.Or in the case of B.L.I.N.D systems a stacking debuff say  hits on the target or you getting the kill will trigger the effect if its not on cooldown.  Or after hits the target becomes blinddeft. This way these sets will always have some use in all aspects not just low HP PvE. ,thedivision,d5151dr,1,t5_2xiqd

8203711,0,t3_4roapi,Nice man. Remember though as a solo supply drop player we annoy groups farming up there in DZ. While they frantically try to clear the landmark theyre in or ditch it as quickly as possible we are already waiting for the drop. So as they finally make it to that drop and see our lone agent pop the box and run away.. it probably kinda pisses them off. Even more when we manage to grab both boxes if they spawn in  and .During one of my runs I grabbed the east side DZ box while a group was stuck dealing with the NPCs just to the north. I took off to get the eastside DZ box. I get there and managed to get the box over half way opened... when that group caught up to me. They interupted me and proceeded to open it. I pull out a grenade stop him and I started opening. It was a mess because the NPCs were targeting them not me. They stop me again. I throw another grenade and stop them. They decided to flash the entire area and i think everyone was disoriented because I almost opened the box. At that point they resorted to going rogue on me and downed me but they didnt wanted to fully down me. So when they tried to open the box they kept reviving me instead. Hahah.. it was hilarious. They had to keep backing off and I watched them die to NPCs as they couldnt open the box. After a handful of reviving each other they opted to fully kill me and go lvl  rogue.Fun times. Was one of the most entertaining supply runs Ive had.,thedivision,d530nvw,1,t5_2xiqd

We ended up dropping  of their guys and the remaining  started to book it out of there. Thats when we noticed that a second  man group had joined in on the chase. As we chased the last  rogues down the road I popped some explosive bullets with my Reclaimer and all  of us light the two rogues up. The other guys had no clue why they had explosive bullets. We said hi to them and parted ways. A little while later we were clearing the Q and we ran into them again and they recognized my name so we asked if we could follow them around clearing landmarks. I told them in exchange I would keep them topped off with explosive and incendiary bullets. Apparently they only really played in the DZ and hadnt done DN so they didnt know about reclaimer. They were like oh thats why weve constantly had explosive bullets. Apparently I had been giving them ammo as we were fighting in other areas.

I would have loved to see some variation in the coding of the AI for each faction. Like street thugs could have pistols and SMGs but never use cover. LMB would have rifles and heavy armor.

Keep also current dz and make it valuable but not neccicary to play it. Have it as an alternative. Maybe add some cost metric fluff to it so those that want it can get it there. . Balance all pvp to be within   from the poorest gear and top tier gear. . Make it a toggle option to have all enemies you meet while roaming outside the dz to scale to your choice.

Specially Vigorous as it can be a really good skill for you and your teams. Savage is really good but depending on your CHC your pulse or the pulse of other team mates can get you to the cap and waste the . It works on PvP against conceal pulse though. As long as you get a really nice pair of Savage gloves try them.About talents is hard to say because some may be personal preference. As a base Id look to have at least Brutal Deadly Destructive. To mix them up for PvPvE I like Ferocious for PvE needs to be a free talent and Fierce also needs to be free or Responsive Unforgiving is a little underrated imo and its useful for PvP. Skilled is a really great talent that works for both but it needs to be rolled on the free slot as well.You already have a really nice and good working build.

8342570,0,t3_4toxsd,I like a lot of your ideas. Great post!My changes would be as follows.A separation between PVE and PVP    This could be done in many ways but here are two. One you Pick Agent or Rogue at the checkpoint. Agents can only fight NPCs and Rogues can only fight Rogues. Agents earn gear and XP by fighting NPCs and Rogues earn gear and supply drops for kill streaks. Rogues drop half their bag when killed. If you only have one item in your inventory it cannot be dropped upon death. Rope cutting is removed. That way you would never leave the DZ without at least some progress.    Two move the DZ bosses into the PVE map. PVP players would earn gear through kill streaks supply drops and stealing from other Rogues.    Enemy health    This could be fixed in many ways and is pretty straightforward and others have listed those ways better than I could. Moving on.Ammo    Give us more ammo. There should be a higher base amount of ammo for each weapon. For instance  ARSMG  MMShotgun. That way extra ammo would be a preference rather than a necessity. Obviously the ammo amounts could change depending on enemy healtharmor changes.    Insane jump between difficulties    For instance Underground should be something like this.    Normal  level  enemies.    Hard  level  enemies and level  boss.    Challenging  level  enemies and level  elites and boss.    Heroic  level  enemies and level  boss.    Weighted activities    Weighted activities are fine even necessary but the degree of weighting needs to be toned down... a lot. You should be able to increase your chances of getting what you want by playing a specific activity but it shouldnt be a necessity.    Gear set changes    Dead Eye pc buff should be   Stability.    Lone Star pc buff should be   equiped weapon damage.    Blind pc buff should be  flash bang capacity. The pc buff should be killing a target creates a large immediate flash bang effect.    Firecrest pc buff should be reload speed and the pc buff should be your bullets have a  chance to ignite enemies.    Predators Mark pc should be  AR and  SMG.    Enemies taking cover    Enemies take cover for far too long after getting shot. It can really make situations boring and frustrating when theres a timer involved. Decrease the amount of time they stay in cover after being shot.    Pointless or useless stats    There are a lot of useless or pointless stats in this game that need to be fixed or removed. We all know what they are. One thing Id like to see done is have the damage resistance stats rolled into one stat called resistance. Theres no point in having  fire blind and shock resistance roll on the same piece of armor. Its such a small meaningless amount anyway. Id rather roll something like  Resistance  Ammo Capacity and  Scavenging. Having all these pointlessuseless skills really dilutes our loot drops.    More Space We need more space for items. Moving on.    Quality of drops by difficulty    Normal  .        Hard   and .    Challenging   and  with a decent chance at  and .    Heroic   and  from bosses and normal enemies can drop HE crafting mats.    Solo difficulty    Decrease the current difficulty of PVE content while playing solo.    HVTSearch and Destroy    Search and Destroy missions would be a lot more enjoyable if the amount of running between the three points was reduced. Lets say keep it at ft and below. Anything more than that makes the missions a slog and slows down what could be a fun burst of action.    Daily missions    Daily missions should each drop a one time random piece of loot scaled to your GS.    Thats about all I can think of right now. Im sure Ill think of more once I hit post though lol.

8424076,0,t3_4v0q43,Im sorry but I couldnt disagree more with SkillUps video on electronics. Its short sighted and completely ignores the need for stamina and the ability to actually kill the NPC. The best builds in the game are still balanced builds. Something like K DPS K Toughness and K skill power will move through content faster and not have the same issues like the OP is haing with his friends. Yes you need a support guy one support guy not  or . Support is a function and should still be able to help finish off NPCs. With DPS below K as a support guy you are more a liability to the team then an asset. Im speaking from experience as I have several builds I run depending on the group. Sentry with reckless K DPS K toughness K skill power Tactician with  pcs final measure K DPS K toughness K skill power native and I have  EDR I also have firecrest reclaimer and alpha I can run if needed but these two builds are my best right now. They are balanced and I nor my team go down often because we have  support and at times  support and  reclaimer. Just because some dude makes a video doesnt mean hes right. Granted I really like SkillUp but I think hes way wrong in the last video he made about this subject and I think its pulling the community in the wrong direction. OP you have to get that toughness up to K or more and that PDS needs to be at least K DPS or you will never be able to down NPCs.

Many posts are trollers who just say that the game sucks or the game is unplayable...etc. when it is playable and does not suck. Because people dont understand game development they start trolling and the devs have to take a lot of shit from that and it really sucks when you think about it. We tend to ignore the trollers and say that ugh trollers will always be trollers but we dont realize how serious this can be. It makes The Division Reddit Community look bad and it gives us a bad image to newcomers. When someone new enters this subreddit and sees all the negativity...it doesnt really wanna make them join us ya know?

Game cant be played solo because the NPCs are spongy gods? Join Discord and team up... that is until all the noobs ALSO join and they expect other noobs to help them thru the punishing content. Getting griefed by a group of OP rogues? Join Discord and team up... that is until your team gets griefed on by multigroups of rogues. NPCs oneshotting you in the Underground? Join Discord and team up... that is until Massive decides theyre going to nerf anything that helps you hello police backpack and doesnt bother fixing the features that are supposed to work hello striker set Loot system isnt rewarding because youre only getting HFLSFCBLIND? Live with it. Aka join Discord to team up and farm.And the theory that Discord is populating this forum with fake posts  I wouldnt discount it.

8489871,0,t1_d62g7xq,WAIT!The rewards uKilow mentioned are the UG caches. Operation rewards whether drops from chests or from phasemission completion are limited according to difficulty  youll pretty much never get a  from anything but heroic operations read there may be an astronomically small possibility of getting one with lower difficulty but at UGsomething Ive never seen one.If your GS is  and you dont have a pile of  gear in your stashinventory your caches will be very disappointing and effectively wasted. To assure  items from your caches your GS needs to be  and you should qualify for the  DZ bracket. Cache GS is set when they are received not when they are opened ranking up earlier will mean lower quality items.If you cannot boost your GS to  or you do not qualify for the  DZ bracket stay out of UG if you want  gear from the caches same goes for SP supply drops. Instead run the weekly HVTs until you have enough probably LS gear to reach  and only then start ranking up. Do the same with an alt or two for double triple or even quadruple the rewards.UG operations at hard will be very easy to complete solo by this point and while the drops from the missions will be immediately converted to credits or mats the caches will hook you up  but only if you have a high enough GS when you rank up.,thedivision,d62s582,2,t5_2xiqd

8632733,0,t3_4y3h1m,While it is possible the two games are vastly different and the only reason they can even be mentioned in the same sentence is Tom Clancy. There is no real SP experience in Siege even though I wish there was as I had high hopes for Patriots when it had been announced. And the PVP is classic PVP. Smaller maps defined enemies defined objectives and the only advantage one team may have over the other is those players may have a wider variety of characters to choose from more unlocked which at this stage of the game seems unlikely. There is no luck involved with what characters you unlock where as in the division Ive played matches where the players I was matched with were getting gear set items and I was getting weapons or high end items from killing the exact same boss. I remember one time a guy got a  first wave M with awesome with perks like Brutal Deadly and stable and I got an X yet again. So in Siege there is no such thing as RNG so it makes the game closer to being balanced.,thedivision,d6kp5qr,1,t5_2xiqd

8713557,0,t3_4z8j1n,Not a bad post however some of your suggestions would just create new problems. For example your Currency Incentives section you talk about adding weapons with Good Rolls this will create a scenario where like in other games were people will just farm for currency just to buy the weekly items. Another problem is that they want loot to be the primary source of obtaining gear this is completely contrary to this vision and Im not even going to get in to what would define good rollsIn your PC vs Console Balance section you want the cap for semiauto weapons to be RPM why should players get less interesting weapons because Consoles have a poor input device? Also RPM are significantly worse for PC players than Console players due to something commonly referred to as over sample  click per second isnt that difficult for a console player and is fast but natural on a controller. However on a mouse  clickper second is fast but quite natural on a mouse this means that a rpm weapon will have  slower fire rate on a PC due to over sample delay.  ,thedivision,d6utygx,2,t5_2xiqd

8776486,0,t1_d72p04t,What do you think I was doing. The game has limited options. As a solo player because all of my IRL friends completely abandoned this game a month after launch I had two matchmaking options . Incursions and Underground on Hard where nothing better drops. Then DZ and daily challenging mission with a minimal chance for an upgrade. When I looked on what to spend my phoenix credits I saw things that were either worse or  piece of a set not worth replacing the  set bonus.. Or I could just matchmake for a challenging difficulty that Im capable of running  minimum  optimum means my  was something of a minimal requirement but my  GS would get me kicked out in a millisecond so no group of GS  would ever take me. I did find some normal people and managed to get a couple runs however again  poorly rolled item of a random set I got is nothing.Not to mention that the entire GS since the same pieces can be either perfect or complete shite based on individual values thing is absolutely and utterly ridiculous because I knew that my nicely optimized sentry with team  damage bonus was worth way more. But no the game would rather have me strap on some random  GS stuff I found that would make me a much stronger player on paper but in reality my benefits in the group would be nonexistent.The thing even Massive mentioned in the . update is that the gear you need for a specific difficulty drops on that difficulty which is bonkers and they only found out now? After years of development and months of player feedback? Come on. Not to mention that the IVs on item levels are way all over the place.,thedivision,d72q8s5,1,t5_2xiqd

8845941,0,t1_d7b1nwq,Nothing wrong with high stats Lonestar and Blind.Ive got three primary builds all based around a  piece bonus with interchangeable  piece or hodge podge for the stat bonus depending on the activity. I even have  nomad gloves that I regularly use due to the perfect roll.When youve picked up enough pieces youll start to get an idea of what to build around based on the RNG of the gear. For example I got a couple of  tactician pieces that rolled with exotic damage resistance so I slap them with  final measure a couple of mods and Ive got  EDR  perfect for incursions and dz cleaners.Or  piece Alpha bridge with assault rifle and enemy armour damage rolled on a few pieces. Add  striker pieces for the extra enemy armour damage and I can get it up to . I wouldnt recommend just having  piece striker but in this case it helps a treat. The higher your percentages the more exponential the effect.Consider  piece LS  piece blind  piece tactician gear towards maxing your pulse crit damage to  any team would love to have that. Youll have plenty of ammo so you dont waste time restocking so much. If you roll skill power on your mask and pack you can get skill power up pretty high without needing to put points in electronics. Roll armour in your chest to compensate. Its the highest item for armour and can get up to .Take a look at minor skills see if you can synergise some pieces towards enemy armour damage or elite damage they can add up or gear towards a particular skill bonus like pulse smart cover or first aid.Consider also savage gloves and reckless or vigorous chest. These are great one piece high ends that boost your damage. If youve got k skill power and run vigorous with booster shot first aid you get an overheal that gives you damage bonus and resistance.The point is there are a lot of combinations that dont rely on having all  pieces of a set.Having said that some sets arent really worth having unless you have all bonuses unlocked and should only be considered if they have great stats. Alphabridge  or  piece is pretty lame. Hunters faith as a whole is pretty poor as well. I typically wouldnt use striker unless I had all  and even then Id rather  piece sentry.,thedivision,d7b5nkk,3,t5_2xiqd

8859734,0,t1_d7crjzf,Actually I think the fact that the targets are stationary is the best feature because then low hit rates can only be blamed on the player or the gun. And most players will naturally blame the gun which is generally the correct answer anyway.As for a like combat metric Im all for it. But I think DPS would be hard to track because of how you determine the time interval. It could only be while shooting but that becomes more complicated for semi auto and boltpump action. And you cant just rely on time spent ADS either.Maybe if they just tracked bullets fired bullets hit and total dmg dealt by weapon category then run the numbers after youre out of combat with a little pop up like they do for prestige points.

8873445,0,t3_51rrfs,Very nice breakdown and ideas.  I mentioned this in another thread and many agreed that some of the most fun that was had in this game was those few nights before the . patch where multiple groups were able to join in on the same mission.  I remember matchmaking into Russian Consulate where a group was doing this  and ended up having over  agents plowing through the LMB and the engine was handling all of those agent models perfectly fine except when someone equiped Explo rounds then it became a slideshow haha.  Made we wonder at the time why massive did not implement multiteam missions.  Fast forward to now I have a better understanding why they didnt do it as they seem not to have the capabilities to do so be it time constraints or technical abilities based on the current state of the game.  Not saying that they do not have the expertise to pull it off its just that there are fundamental things wrong with this game now that need to be addressed if they get that done first then maybe we might be able to have some hope for multiteam raid type modes.  ,thedivision,d7egogn,1,t5_2xiqd

8875781,0,t1_d7eo9kn,I do agree this will go someway to fix some issues I am reluctant to say that it will fix all issues.  The problem with the test server is that the bulk of the player base is likely to be console and each console has their own specific issues.  Neither of which are really testable the same method due to cost of each patch and approval routes for each console provider.  Its not easy to have nightly patches or multiple patches per day for that.  Im not super optimistic because its the same coders and quality control people doing this work that did the original work and it wasnt stellar to begin with and with each shabby patch it went from bad to worse.  Im a bit pessimistic with Massive right now becasue of how they have handled their business.  Basically it took a huge loss in user base for them to admit that the community was correct about issues.  To me its like the car dealership calling you back after they offered their best price and wanting to make another offer when they realized that you seriously wanted to buy.  Their user base wanted to play and they didnt want to fix the experience so users left and now they realized that it was a mistake to do that.

Or make it to wear after x amount of damage dealt you can auto refresh a skill that is on cooldown instead of just a set timer.Something like that would fall into the person being a modder.

8937439,0,t3_52nzyw,First Yes weapons have different build in headshot multipliers. I dont remember what the numbers are but they have a different multiplier by weapon class.Second Weapon mods are simlpy adding their percentage. If the innate multiplier us  and you have a  mag you should end up with a multiplier of . The Brutal damage talent was a multiplier once upon a time. It got nerfed and I am not sure if it is still multiplicative or additive now.About your example with the weapon damage do keep in mind that there also is a damage multiplier and that all weapon damage you get on mods and talent is additive to it. Meaning that if you have a  weapon damage mag allready and you get another  weapon damage from somewhere you get a multiplier of .

8955424,0,t3_52wo7s,I have many many hours invested.  I was very fortunate to have the whole summer off so it was great to get such extensive time in playing this game pretty much exclusively since day one launch... Now back to work haha.I wouldnt say Im a complete hardcore gamer.  I have a full time job and other responsibilities.  Like many others of course.  I think Im in the same boat at Deep Fried Dave.  A Casualcore player.  Or Moderatecore player if you will.My point is I do care what Hardcore players think.  Well if they are making rational and logical points that is.  The truth is this game was dying.  Something HAD to be done.  Yes there are  percenters out there but they arent the norm.  Theres a reason theyre dubbed  percenters.  And more power to them!  But the bulk of the gaming community is composed of casual to moderate players.  These are the groups who drive the game.  Who really sustain the coreheart of the game.  Had Massive done nothing and all that was left were the Hardcoreers... the game wouldve been dead.  We need to bring the player base back!  Revive the game.As far as the possibility of the NPCs being too easy they did say on more than one occasion that the . NPCs will be different in terms of difficulty.  Saying dont think of lvl  NPCs how we know them now.  To me this means straight up Fundamental Change!  Which is great news because I didnt think theyd go that far!  The changes they announced it really does mean they are really trying to change the complete core of the game.  That speaks volumes to me because at this stage in gaming terms its not an easy thing to do.  They had to admit fault!  Which takes guts.  Then they took course of action.  Proactive!  They surprised me.  Kudos to Massive!  Seriously... this is freakn awesome.  And this was only a fraction of the changes to come with ..  Bananaz!,thedivision,d7ob3hj,2,t5_2xiqd

9108477,0,t1_d86opby,I am aware its the first iteration but if we dont provide feedback and our honest opinions then the process wont work. SMGs even specd for crit which is now much harder to attain and damage are far far to weak. I can just spec a Lvoac or lightweight M the same way and it handles as well has more range more damage and often a bigger magazine as well as a high rof. Thats the issue. Every class outperforms the SMG now by a significant amount. Balance is the key not super nerfs and buff. Try out an SMG on the PTS even a god roll and you will stop trying almost instantly regardless of your build and look elsewhere. ,thedivision,d86oxe0,1,t5_2xiqd
9108530,0,t1_d86p3nn,sure  gt Greetings Agents! gt Here is the list of changes deployed during the PTS update of September . Note that all comparative values here are related to what was available in the PTS Week  and not the live version. We have also update the Global Patch Note for better comparison with the live version of the game. gt Game changes gt Gameplay gt Player grenade damage now scales with the current World Tier to ensure consistent efficiency against NPCs across World Tiers.Shotgunner NPCs their damage falloff and accuracy have been slightly reduced. This should limit their range and lower their lethality in long to midrange combat.World Tier amp Dark Zone bracket If the player has enough Gear Score to unlock a new World Tier but is still below the matching Dark Zone bracket requirement he will still be able to join the higher Dark Zone bracket by selecting the higher World Tier. For example a player with Gear Score  can go to World Tier  but would be forced into Dark Zone bracket  due to his GS being bellow  which can be very confusing. Now if he selects World Tier  he will be put in Dark Zone bracket . If he selected World Tier  he will be put in Dark Zone bracket  until his Gear Score reaches the next Dark Zone bracket minimum requirement. This only applies when the Gear Score is right in the middle of two World Tiers  to   to   to Underground checkpoints have been removed from the game until a better implementation can be developed post ..Several improvements to NPC AI.Player health will now progressively regenerate to full when out of combat. gt Gear Stats gt Armor Damage Mitigation cap increased from  to Toughness now takes All Damage Resiliency into accountReduced Health on Kill bonuses on Gear by . This change also applies to existing gear. Nomad piece bonus is not impacted by this change.Skill Haste bonus will now directly affect Skill cooldowns by the same amount. For example  Skill Haste will reduce Skill cooldown by . gtGear Sets gt Tacticians Authority Pieces  Skill Haste Pieces  Skill PowerLone Star Pieces LMG Damage Shotgun DamagePredators Mark Pieces  Reload Speed Pieces Assault Rifle Damage SMG Damage Pieces Hit  shots without switching target to make the target take damage over time for  of the total amount of damage already done by those bulletsFinal Measure Pieces  Exotic Damage ResilienceReclaimer Pieces  Consumable duration Pieces  Support Station duration Pieces Consumables and special ammo used now apply to the whole group and are not consumed on use. Triggers consumable cooldowns and cannot start consumables that are on cooldown.B.L.I.N.D. becomes Banshee Pieces  Dark Zone Currency gained Pieces  Damage to targets out of cover PiecesWhile Rogue all ammo is completely refilled every  seconds. Damage taken from nonrogue players reduced by .While not Rogue movement speed is increased by . Damage to Rogue players is increased by Note  Due to streaming issues the movement speed will have to be removed in a future update of the PTS and will be replaced with another bonus. Suggestions are welcome!Note  All existing pieces of B.L.I.N.D. will be replaced with equivalent Banshee pieces. gt Weapons gt DPS calculation has been changed to be closer to the old formula without accuracy and considering a  headshot rate. Note that this formula is still Work in Progress.Weapon recalibration When recalibrating a weapon the player will now be able to pick from  Talents additionally to the initial one instead of . This should lower the impact of RNG and increase the chances to actually get the talent you want before you run out of tries.LMGReduced all LMGs Damage bonus on targets out of cover from about  maximum to  maximumM Damage reduced by M Damage reduced by .RPK Damage reduced by L Damage reduced by .Marksman RifleSCAR Damage reduced by .SVD Damage increased by .SMGReduced all SMG Critical Hit Damage bonus from about  maximum to  maximumAUG Damage increased by MP Damage increased by .MP Damage increased by .PP Damage increased by .SMG Damage increased by .Vector Damage increased by . gt Weapon Talents gt Ferocious Bonus Damage reduced from  to Responsive Bonus Damage Reduced from  to  gt Gear Talents gt Reckless Bonus Damage Reduced from  to  damage taken unchangedSavage Bonus Critical Hit Chance reduced from  to  gt Character Talents gt Chain Reaction Decreased Damage bonus by  from  to  gt Skills gt First Aid Defibrillator no longer revives players from death as it was deemed too powerful. Defibrillator will only revive players from downed state as it was the case pre ..Ballistic ShieldBase health of the Shield has been increased by Now takes  less damage from NPCsSeeker MineCluster now applies bleed effect on top of its usual damageSmart CoverTrapper now applies a Stability and Accuracy debuff to enemies in cover equivalent to the normal buff provided by Smart CoverBase skill and all mods no longer have range capBase skill and all mods Weapon Stability bonus changes from  to .Base skill and all mods Weapon Accuracy bonus changes from  to .Support StationWhen playing solo if the player is downed while his Station is active he will be able to revive himselfSignature SkillsImplemented a shared cooldown mechanic in a group players who receive a buff from any Signature Skill will be immune to the same signature skill for  seconds after the first one runs out.All signature skills have their duration increased by  from  seconds to  seconds. gt High Value Targets gt Prices of High Value Target contracts have been adjusted and normalized to avoid overlaps. This results in an overall slight decrease of cost for many contracts.Daily High Value Targets now all scale with group size.Weekly High Value Targets will always be scaled for  players groups.The difficulty of some of the hardest HVT contracts have been slightly lowered. gt Loot gt Gear Set items have been removed from drop pools in World Tier . This means that in World Tier  NPCs bosses and activity rewards will only provide High End items and no Gear Set at Gear Score . Gear Set still have a low chance to be dropped with Gear Score  in World Tier . This should help easing progression between tiers and bring new players more gradually to the concept of endgame gearing up.Dark Zone named NPCs drop rates modifiedx High End or Gear Setx High End Gear Mod or Weapon Mod instead of x Gear SetDrop rates have been modified for all named NPCs encountered during missions and incursions outside of the actual boss. They will no longer guarantee HighEnd drops.Underground The loot chest at the end of an Underground phase will no longer guarantee a HighEnd item.Vendors will now sell Sealed Cache for all currencies. Pricings are still Work in Progress in this build.Vendors will now scale with World Tier and no longer sell items that are of a high Gear Score than what can be acquired in the Tier.Marksman Rifles ARs and Shotgun prices have been lowered.Gear Set items now cost as much as a high end gear piece resulting in a large price reduction.Item prices in DZ Funds have been adjusted. Gear score  item prices went slightly up as gear score  items got a small price decrease. These changes were made for a more normalized fairer price increase of items with gear score.Items priced in Phoenix Credit gear score  went down in price slightly whereas items gear score  went slightly up. These changes were made for a more normalized price increase of items with gear score.General Assembly mission The Helicopter boss will still drop  items. On normal difficulty these  items will be of Superior or HighEnd quality. On Hard it will drop HighEnd items only. These items can be of any type instead of only equipment items.Reduced chances for some drops to be a weapon and increased chance for it to be gear. gt UI Improvements gt Performance Mod Slots will now appear separately from the normal Mod Slots on the right of a gear icon. Note that there is currently a known issue with this change where pre . items may have their Mod Slots icons duplicated on the right side of the Gear icon this is only a display issue and does not mean that the amount of mod slots has increased.Recalibration bench now opens instantly instead of waiting for watch tapping animation. gt Bug fixing gt Fixed a bug where the piece talent of Final Measure would not defuse the APC Mortar shells in Falcon Lost.Fixed a bug where the game could freeze when holding the skill deployment button of a second skill when the character was using a Mobile Cover.Fixed a bug where two deprecated blueprints Iron Sight  and  could be acquired. gt Gameplay gt Fixed a bug where NPC turrets would count towards Daily and Weekly Assignments for this NPC type.Fixed a bug where named bosses could respawn in the Open World when going to a safe house.,thedivision,d86p5lq,5,t5_2xiqd

9124895,0,t1_d88kj9h,And they dont realize that the only way to get ppl to go into the DZ is to give them tons of loot outside the DZ. The reason people step into the DZ and then immediately never return is because the gankers are better equipped than the pvers. All the pve only skillstalents like destructiveferociousdmg to elitesprot from elites are also causing an imbalance between pvpers and pvers. A pveer thats been perfecting his build for pve will get destroyed in the DZ because half his skillstalents are completely useless there.

For some reason I enjoy evading rogues and timing my extractions around the location of rogue mobs. Its pretty fun to to signal an extraction at one point and run off to another one while the rogues run around the last one wondering where you are. What I hate about the DZ is the absurdly large statistical gap when it comes to the gear metas. If you dont have one of the current meta builds youre screwed. On top of that the last thing I want is to loose all the DZ credits keys and XP that I just gained in the last hour or even the last day.

There are many ways people like me could be made happier a few but not all of them are. Mark all of the Seek amp Destroy missions as well as the HVT missions on the map. Make them activate as soon as we get close to the region. This way we dont have to constantly fast travel we can enjoy walking around NY and doing whatever missions is close by or available. Increase the density a little bit so most of the map is covered similar density to the Landmarks in the DZ.. Create another Tier lets call it Tier . In this Tier the LZ bosses are accompanied by purple and yellow enemies. There is way more of them scattered around the map so we can enjoy walking around NY and killing bad guys but not like now where you have to walk for ages to see anyone and when you do see somebody they are not really a threat..

9216368,0,t1_d8k8llh,I have similar feelings. All of my friends left the game in . but I found a new group to play with met them in the DZ. We handled heroic incursions and underground with ease. When they announced World Tiers in the special report they implied that a solo player would likely have to do normal or hard mode and a group would probably be needed to handle challenge mode. This made sense. It was good news for solo players because they could get  gear in normalhard mode as well. It was good news for group players because it implied that challenge mode missions would still be hard and we could try them with a group if we wanted more gear than normalhard.But now in the PTS it has become increasingly obvious that they are trying to make EVERYTHING soloable. I dont get that. Its a squadbased game. The World Tier system provides a way for solo players to gear up with normalhard mode missions...Why do they need to do challenge mode as well? If you can solo challenge mode easily I can whats the point of matchmaking and finding new friends? And it seems like A LOT of people have made this assumption as well...because it seems very hard to find people in matchmaking on the PTS. No one wants to team up...because you dont need to.,thedivision,d8k8r5u,1,t5_2xiqd
9217449,0,t1_d8kddse,Well the reasons quite simple tbh. If they dont have the upgraded versions of the skills then balancing could begin. The whole point of the dz is that its meant to be a dz. if I had it my way Id work a emp blast into the zone. Make sig skills timers minutes instead of . Disable  piece skills. The whole playing field would be levelled. The only reason my ideas on this dont get through is that what I said above. If you want balance were gonna have to take a penalty for going to dz in the first place. I really think they missed a chance to make something truely mad max style. Of scavenging be killl or be killed type game mode that actually takes away easy ways out like over dose and triage. It could have been better then it is now.

Generally in these type of games the hardest content drops the best stuff. So the hardcore people will have a little bit better gear or gear that has unique properties.

9230363,0,t1_d8m055v,I mean it did help that they were all bottlenecked in that door so you could land a ton of shots and kill some of them before they have a chance to flank you. I wonder what would happen if you were caught in open space where they can surround you. You would have to take cover then I think. Still it looks easy. I am not saying it should be impossible to solo this mission on CM but  at the right level of difficulty youd have to equip crowd control skills while gradually retreating finding cover so that you can kill them one at the time. I remember playing this mission on Heroic .  in the group a month or so ago and we wiped a couple of times at the point where you are recording. Then we realized we needed to aggro the shotgunners leave a shock turret in the room and retreat to let some space between us and also to get out of line of fire of those LMB heavies. I think the same tactic should be necessary when you solo this. ,thedivision,d8m0l8b,3,t5_2xiqd

9242902,0,t1_d8n53nm,First since Uplay doesnt give out numbers neither of us know how many players use it for sure. Second if there are actually a lot more players...that doesnt help your case if the DZ is again largely abandoned. That means even MORE players dont like it and choose not to take part it in. Thus making the problem worse.Also not knowing how to build is very subjective. Considering the grind in . to get gear at all once you have a PvE set why bother with a pvp? Yes . may be increasing that rate by a bit but also keep in mind that then you have to keep a pvp and pve set. Of all of the things you listed not having the right stats is not skill based. Again name any open world PvP area that lasted all that long where the game wasnt intentionally built around pvp so no DAoC or EvE.Furthermore you keep avoiding issues. Such as population advantages or the fact that there really is no riskreward to players who have already maxed out. Rogue status should always be a risk for one reason or another and right now it isnt. Unless you can introduce such a risk such as with gear breaking the best option is to set stats so that the chances of a steamroll are lessened. ,thedivision,d8nlsgw,1,t5_2xiqd

Nerfing hok dies however make you more reliant on first aidmedkits and reduce build diversity. On the move reduces build diversity also because its op as fuck.ampnbspI can agree with you about people blowing things out of proportion and reading into changes as attacksintentions deeper than balancing the game. I dont think it is true on build diversity though. Ive been saying it since alphabeta part of massives strategy to balance the game is force people into similar attribute spreads majors etc. ampnbspThe scaling has been so bad and options so limited that there can be no other explanation. Look ato the overheal mechanic your forced to run first aid and from there forced to run overheal because it was implemented so badly its far superior to the other heals and they actually made it better in . like wtf. Smg and marksmen rifles at launch shotguns having independant pellets that make flat bonuses x stronger than other weapons and crit damage exponentially more efficient.

9412331,0,t1_d991w9y,Without any stability mods on most of the Assault Rifles jump around too much.  The AK P and M have horrible recoil and climb way too much.  If you were to mod your Assault rifle with a lot of ChC ChD HsD you would do a great deal of damage when you hit but the majority of your bullets would miss during the last half to s of the magazine since it jumps so much.Sure stability and accuracy will improve your Actual DPS but doesnt reflect on the Sheet DPS.  The same is said about accuracy.  If you play as close to your target as possible then the jump doesnt matter much but if you were to try and play a pure DPS build at range like you would with an LMG it would be too hard to control and maximize your DPS.Not only that the DPS you do the NPCs is greater than what you would do against a Player.  The armor shred damage doesnt work on players so again the Sheet DPS doesnt accurately show the deficit vs players.,thedivision,d992ui6,1,t5_2xiqd
9413069,0,t1_d98wy2o,Yeah. At launch I made a tank build that used an M and  back when they sucked.

Lvoc mp st  dpsdps I think toughness k sp. mostly armor but with robust in the bag Ive im getting melted too much I switch to that and take cover move with Smart Cover to help with the Lvoc and extra resistance. Tactics are basically hide and run  lol Im kidding. I usually use the bleed effect to run around and tag teams attempting to run away from rogue hunters. This usually gets me into trouble with with concealed on they pretty much cant really see you when their back is turned lol. Its asshole but sometimes for kicks I run multi bombs just for the extra bleed. Then for talents. Using wildfire with a flame turret is really your best bet for rushing players esp when in pairs as no doubt both with get flame making them noncombations for awhile and with the wildfire its  chance to spread. This goes for shrapnel as well basically the same thing but its a lot easier to get groups together. I wouldnt recommend running with both but if you want to take of one is none and aim for body shots in stead feel free. I would advise one bit of advice for solo players dont trust anyone! Just go with your gut and help other teams when possible. This build should be used to tag and chase just remember your not actually the one doing the chasing your simply allowing other players to play catch up. Once this is done and the rogue is dead do not stand about  times those rogue hunters are probably rogues that were killed by the team they just killed and then that team went rogue on them so get out of dodge as soon as the guys are killed ,thedivision,d9fj9n7,0,t5_2xiqd

Ill start DZ again soon due to banshee but it will still be a laughable attempt at pvp imho due to the fact that you are always unsure of who your opponent is.My best suggestion to them would be ranked pvp matches in the form of v UG style pvp. Use smaller maps let players spawn in a limited number of times have them fight it out for currency pvp only currency that can be used for pvp specific gear sets and random caches. Give winners twice as much of the currency and give everyone a cache... It will rain loot and give us the pvp I want. Of course thats just my . right? D,thedivision,d9h0duz,1,t5_2xiqd

9550651,0,t1_d9q3pqi,Ive been cultivating BOTH.  Believe me...it makes a huge difference.  They may not be equal to one another but combined they do great things. I dont want to assume you dont know how enemy armor works in this game but in the event that you do not...  The armor bars act pretty much like additional health bars.   Rather than depleting them as typical EAD allows you to do greater damage to those bars of armor.  Its especially important because those jackass fucking medics will heal their allies heath AND armor.  So being able to dispatch an enemies armor so you can get down to their actual healthbar and kill them is a fine ability to have.The best defense in this game has always been a good offense.   And  having already sacrificed some combination of health stamina or armor to get these things...it sucks to now be stuck without them and have what I rolled for whacked with a fucking hammer...especially since the gear I have is going to have to carry me through a new higher tier of content.   So...reduce health stamina and armor to chase EAD...get that nerfed or removed entirely...and then here....have a new more difficult NPC level to go up against with those changes.  Really tho...whatever right?  Ill wait and see how things work after the update.  If it sucks that bad I can always play something else.  So Ill cease speculating at this point and just wait and see.,thedivision,d9qbcde,1,t5_2xiqd

While he is VERY opinionated if you read every article hes written about The Division mostly everything he says is fair game if not all of the facts are entirely accurate.Hes also never hidden the fact that he plays the Division quite a lot. Its what helps him provide valid points to his arguments. Even in this article he clearly states that hes been playing heavily since .  and in another he stated that although Battlefield  and Titanfall had come out he would just keep coming back to play .. He enjoys the game and even if hes not a hardcore hes pretty in touch with the community.I think that if anyone has clear evidence against them trying to destroy the Division is probably massive themselves then. If . wasnt the madness that it was if the endgame wasnt a mess until . like it was if gear were actually attractive and exotic to chase after if incursions werent horde mode if the DZ wasnt weighed entirely against rogues at first then weighed entirely against nonrogues after if UG wasnt a gated drag of a grind completely separate from the game experience if if if.......then Forbes and every other gaming site wouldnt have written the pieces they did.Im a giant Division fan officially clocked in  days of playtime last night lol but reality is this game has not had a good track record.

A player can also play a different suit but he cannot win the round unless the differing suit is a trump card.Just like this you would need to be able to do things in a orderly fashion to win and would need to blow up the wall to win which will take a few things working together to do.

9587115,0,t1_d9urc0p,Probably because the game is heavily reliant on armor right now over other stats which in turn force a certain gameplay style? Quite ironic how you listed this as wellgt Variety in the meta?,thedivision,d9ut37b,1,t5_2xiqd
9588178,0,t1_d9tesvg,gtPvP is more difficult. Which means it is more rewarding. It is the exact same concept as challenge modes or World Tiers. If you cannot accept such a simple answer then I dont know what else to tell you.This is patently untrue and needs to stop being said.  It is no more difficult than taking down an Incursion I might even say its less so.  They take different skills to excel at one is not any more difficult than the other.  ,thedivision,d9uxszw,2,t5_2xiqd
9591884,0,t3_5cajrc,Totally agree with this but Id like to take this a step further. Each set of armor should have their own min and max armor value that is more realistically tied to their combat role. E.g. the new DFNC set obviously rolls with much higher armor while the other long range sets are lower this would give wearer of these sets a much more clearer combat role and position during combat. This also brings up more the cover shooter and team tactics element during fire fights snipers up back tanks up front etc.. In addition HE gears all have their real world equivalent models and armor type so like armor sets a variety of minmax armor value should also be tied to the piece with a more realistic reflection of what sort of protection that piece of armor provides. This would give rise to much more interesting use of gear talents and provides a good support to armor sets e.g. full hunters set with robust chest piece will provide more protection to the sniper allowing more mobility while a more damage oriented chest piece will give the snipers more deadly shots but requiring more support from team members.Without the armor rolls combined with the above mentioned changes it would make the armor sets and subsequent combination combat style tactics more interesting for sure.,thedivision,d9ve9z7,8,t5_2xiqd

9656994,0,t3_5da1oc,So just turn the darkzone into another LZ so nobody pvps basically. You guys are crazy if the darkzone has no point in you being in there which you stated dont go. Stay out and let us people that pvp do that. If nobody is rogue or going rogue then there is no point in having the darkzone at all. Its just another pve zone to kill bosses. Getting kicked out of the darzone for being rogue or taken off your friends server? Really do you think things through. How about if you pve players come to the darkzone and get killed you have to stay out for a painfully long time to fix your gear before you come back and try to fight again. Not every pvp player kills everything that moves in the darkzone by the way you can avoid other people if you really want to just have to play a little smarter.

I heard calls for a PvE only darkzone but Im against that would rather them populate the main world with simply random squads think just running a rift in Diablo..

I dont see how sitting here without any solution is any better. And you never know the community might surprise you. Considering there are many people in this sub who kept playing with all the bugs left oodles of feedback while playing with the PTS and have put soooo much into repairing this game I think we have a bright chance. Worst case scenario if the app does fall apart we can all just uninstall it. In the meantime if we can make the experience better why not try? Also massive wouldnt have to shoulder the blame if it is a third party app. That independent developer would. I know that when I use community designed companion apps for other games I do so at my own risk as it is made clear the Studio had no hand in development.

9740367,0,t1_dadoxxk,hi hello this is the first time i will post something about the division i was a day  hardcore gamer more than  days of gameplay when it came out I stoped playing when the first incursion came out the sets and the cheaters broke the game. btw i was surprised to see one shot build in the division i still remenber awesome fights in the dark zone where you had to think before engaging but i guess that was replace by shotguns now i came back to play with . theres so much loot now and the game is so easy that me and my fireteam destiny player were maxed out at  and with the builds we wanted in one night we already did everything and theres nothing else to do right now. But the reason i decided to comment was you as a massive employee dont know a release date? you know as much as we do? so what are you guys doing??? how can you be working on an update and dont know when are you going to release it? i dont know whats your job at massive im guessing community manager and if you dont have more visibility than we do whats the point on having one? is the update so messed up that you guys dont know how long it will take to fix it? honestly i gave the division a second chance but now its starting to be hard to give it a third one,thedivision,dadpobu,5,t5_2xiqd
9740379,0,t1_dadnq8s,I do indeed backpedal like a mad man when things get heated but it just feels like the elites hits so hard and have such good aim that even backpedaling like an olympic gymnast puts you down like hitting a bus face first. And I can agree on the backpack its not ideal but its what I got for now and running Amhearst because its easy is getting a bit tedious. Would much rather run Lex but got reckt by the two heavies in the end there. Roof was piece of cake but those heavies. Felt like they tied me down and did alot of prison stuff to me PI am aiming for either a AB build with the Barret chest piece and such but not much luck yet finding AB pieces. Got some FC for possibly running the fire turret build but not enough. Considering to use two pieces of the new set for the  protection from elites as I have two of them.. though it will probably cause me to loose unlock on ele for some talents. Gotta take a closer look at it when Im home from work. I love the ARs always have and I probably will stick with them. They just feel right  My sniping skills are in dire need of practice or having the mobs not move around like rabbits in mating season P  but when I hit it  shots most veterans. And shots the weak spots. Nothing like hitting a cleaner in the tank or grenade guy in the pouch. Makes me giggle in a evil way D,thedivision,dadpq8k,1,t5_2xiqd

I played much of the  build with a marksman build on my primary character played with my roommate but now I only use an MMR when Im LZ farming. My alt I played more of an SMGAR DPS assault mindset and build. It really is up to you.  I would recommend taking a few trips into the DZ before you get to level   not so much for gear you do run the risk of getting ganked if youre running solo but to get familiar with the map and the enemies within. One of the biggest advantages you can have in the DZ is knowing who spawns where and where the little areas are that you can use to your benefit.

9835495,0,t1_dapj3of,Id forgo Adept as a skill.  Fierce is only good in the last slot.  A few things that might work with your build    Responsive Deadly Fierce on your MP.    Vigorous Savage and Tenacious is awesome.  Personally instead of adding electronic mods with armor to increase SP for heals and pulses Id rather run with a Vigorous chest piece Tenacious mask OR Savage gloves but use a Specialized backpack.  That will bring your SP from the low k to the mid ks. THEN you can put stamina and firearms mods with armor on all of your gear. I have all stamina and firearm mods with armor on my alphabridge build  firearms  stamina  electronics and I have like K skill power because of the specialized backpack.  The extra K in SP I get from the specialized backpack is totally worth it over the savage gloves.  Your heals are SO much better.  Have your mask with Crit Chance as the major attribute and enemy armor damage as a minor attribute and also have enemy armor damage as a minor in your kneepads.  Any EAD you have in your build will help you a bit because it lowers enemy damage mitigation. pc banshee is great against targets out of cover who uses cover in PvP in this game anyways? but you can also opt to use a pc predator set for that extra  base damage for SMGs and ARs.  I personally prefer the  pc predator because not only are you getting added damage for your SMG but you can also keep a decent AR as a secondary and have it benefit from the armor damage bonus they have.  Especially if youre running Destructive on it.    Play with it.  Try different set ups and see what you like the most.Thats what Ive done with all of my builds. ,thedivision,dapl5q1,1,t5_2xiqd

Also as other people have said they are hiring more people they do surveys also they fixed much of core game in . for future content pretty sure not just for Last Stand. Ubi is also changing their approach towards game development to be less focused on creating many new games and more on supporting titles they already have for extended periods of time.This is MMO game there is no sens in making game this big for just one year especially that this game has so much potential. I really dislike when people say about Division . For me this would be the stupidest move... like EA stupidity level. This game looks good and gamplay mechanic changes can be done in patches what they proved with .. Development of next game that would probably be much the same is time and money consuming.

If I am trying to flank dont be strafing or move just stay put and tank the bullets while me and others go from the side.  That is the problem to me these guys are moving around like they have no shield.  If you are in the back and you see a guy shooting dont go in front of them.

9876030,0,t1_daumk12,I concur. I sometimes feel like Im playing a different game than other players are. At least in PvE contexts I am more than powerful enough without ever using an AlphaBridge build. Just for example my Frontline build with Pulse allows me to do k  k damage per bullet to Elites and Named enemies when I land critical hits to their heads and there are still ways I can optimize the damage of this build. Even my subpar Firecrest support build gets the job done perfectly well as Im sure a Predators Mark build would too. Players need to stop looking at the theoretical heights of DPS and readjust their perspective. AlphaBridge for PvE is overkill and so are many other DPS build options. You dont need to be most powerful when being nearly as powerful produces similar results in practice.,thedivision,dauvbhk,1,t5_2xiqd

Not sure..its open to interpretation and personal pref as I said I wouldnt want to limit any player playstyle  or abilities I hate nerfs but they do have to happen what I really dont like is Salty nerf calling when somebody dies and wants what killed them nerfed I hate that..Ive all the classes in destiny three toons with every subclass unlocked so its not that I dont like classes just dont think it fits the Division.

Taking my comment out of context and then painting a picture of my opinion with it isnt particularly useful.

As soon as you do that nonRogues within m will hear ISAC say Warning Compromised SHADE Tech detected in the vicinity. This warns nonrogues that there is a rogue nearby without explicitly pointing out who it is.

Ever so often youd get a chance to extract and keep all the loot youve all found or keep going with the risk that if you die you lose all the loot from the very beginning.That sounds similar to endless phases of course and I think it would have been a nice thing.

A friend of mine had just shown up to a Mexican stand offcheckpoint jerk off sesh shortly after joining my group and since nobody could have recognized his name after recent shenanigans I unloaded on his face. Everyone started shooting at me and suddenly theres  rogue timers pinging around me. It was hilarious and I just watched them go at it. But I couldnt help but see a design flaw in group mechanics.    The circle jerk at the checkpoint thing that keeps going on is seriously so annoying. All these people just want PvP but dont have a place to do it. They dont want PvEvP. Every time I had loot dropped upon death it was never picked up.     These people need their own space in which they can PvP without having a rogue mechanic that merely drags out their initial engagements. Sometimes Im a part of them but I dont care about the rogue title. I just want havoc.    Havoc with two vs isnt necessarily havoc though. Its organized PvP with shootonsight. No getting shot in the back. Put up or shut up face to face genuine PvP like these people want but are too pussy footed to initiate because they dont want the first rogue timer.

10032660,0,t3_5j9hwj,Maybe not the full LZ zone but an abbreviated fight location within the zone. Opening it up to the whole map gets too many buildings and sewers for various locations.Since certain matchups would be dictated on choke points and a teams willingness to fight each other there needs to be a mechanism to force a fight rather than a drawn out stalemate waiting for the other team to engage on your terms.I think a zone should be held for  hours to keep it ever changing at least early on.

The amount of assholes in this game their behaviour and how other players tolerate it is drastically different from any other game.The DZ was marketed with aspects of going rogues betrayal etc... but a lot of the asshole players take it above and beyond. In CounterStrike you can play as a terrorist but does that mean you suddenly get a free pass to be racist? Single out and harass players?This is why so many redditors had a problem with Terry proudly admitting hes a DZ asshole.

10054802,0,t3_5jpj8r,gtCan we expect better in the future?Probably not this year. The three DLCs were getting were fully feature roadmapped well before the game came out. With all the resources theyve poured into making their game playable its incredibly unlikely theyve had the time or inclination to add anything to the final DLC.What we know about it is a blurb saying A new threat rises at the beginning of  as players and their squad must prepare to defend against a relentless foe.It sounds like an endless horde mode and a lot of folks think the little clip they showed and some other info out there indicates it could have some tower defense elements.Id say effortwise that sounds about right. Lorewise I wouldnt expect much. For Underground we got one story mission lead in talking about how weve been hammering the various factions and now theyre hitting back. Then you fight a billion dudes in the sewer.For Survival we got a new game mode revolving around a different agent draped in a narrative involving discovering antivirals and getting them out of the Darkzone against all odds. Thats a nice story advancement but its really just the framework of the game mode and isnt explored at all during gameplay.I wouldnt expect much more out of Last Stand than a quick nod to why this new threat is doing its thing then boom new game mode.I dont think this is a ripoff. Calling the DLCs an hour and a ten minutes of content is a bit disingenuous. These two modes are the most repayable part of the game so far. Yeah Underground apparently gets boring after awhile. Yeah Survival isnt a great way to grind loot. But  seems fair for the amount of replayable content you get. Just dont expect the rest of the story in the next one. The only reason to bitch is if you bought the Season Pass and feel ripped off but guess what. Thats on you. There was zero information about any of the content right up until Underground dropped. Yeah thats super shady. Why youd drop money on that is beyond me but buyer beware you know?,thedivision,dbi5yhh,2,t5_2xiqd

10055704,0,t3_5jnni5, named weapongear blueprints should replace the item drop. you can still receive named weapongears on caches gears on survival weapons on UG.  materials used to craft a named weapongear are doubled at least BIS armor needs attention.  put it as a fixed value on various gears and switch this slot with HP weapon damage and skillpower. OR  make it as a visible bar like npc with a slow recharge time more info on weapon base damage and scaling. when i buy a weapon maybe it looks better than mine but only because i increased my FA recently Phoenix Credits cap should be  alphabridge is the meta i suggest to remove  increased weapon damage to something that refills the magazine. something like after  seconds without shooting you receive  bullets for your weapon survival is fun but to me it takes too much time. i play it mostly alone and it always takes  hour. increase npc and materials but keep the virus as it is so who want to spend time to search caches in the DZ is not penalized bring back UG vendor. you made a good decision removing the loot barrier from paid contents but the vendor at least is a source for people that want to grind UG levels like DZ vendors pvp only mode survival is a great example about how pvp should work. put an arena DZ maybe with only players without respawn. basically a deathmatch v and v with  total players. you receive loot based on kills and the last guy or sqad that survive gets doubled loot. for example  kills  chest  kills   chest  kills  .... in party every kill is considered for each member of the squad,thedivision,dbia6oq,5,t5_2xiqd

Its so obviously OP.I cant shake that feeling if we didnt have AB the NPCs would be reaaaaaly close to . levels.However I do occasionally use HE set with Skulls MC gloves with  damage bonus and its nowhere near AB in terms of pure damage output. Im speaking strictly PvE here.AB will be nerfed sooner or later...and only then will everyone see what mess is really NPC health and damage output.

There are a number of viable builds already.Removing AB would only result in a large number of people flocking to whichever set youtube and the hype said was OP next. They cant change gearset usage by killing off a set that by definition reduces diversity.

10165698,0,t1_dbvmequ,Its not always a matter of cheating people when prices are different for cash or plastic but I can see your point and sometimes it is! In the more honest cases its just a matter of cost there are some fees that the companies have to deal with associated with electronic banking using credit and debit and online retail a sort of convenience and access cost. Associating an additional fee for the end consumer when they opt to use those payment methods is simply passing the buck alongopt to use the more costly payment method pay the additional small cost. On the flip side if a customer instead chooses to pay cash straight up in person there may be nofewer fees for the company to deal with so the price is a tiny bit lower. In the honest cases the difference may be just five cents or something for the total purchase just as a weak example. But of course there are the shadier places that do indeed gouge people with their prices unfair markups and all. While many diseases are airborne there are those that arent those that rely upon residue and contact transmission and at least as Amherst made it the contaminant ingame sounds like that sort of thing. To spread the initial infection the transmission vector is diabolically brilliant... As you say though there are any number of different ways to guard ones self against such things and some risks can be almost entirely eliminated...and in the cases where they cant survival skills become immensely handy. Just like those. Even in normal situations theyre incredibly worthwhile.And knowing how to make your own ammo from raw resources would be another great skill to have if the shit were to ever hit the fan. Flintlock muzzleloaders are fun and can be handy even if not immediately useful. Making black powder can be a dirty and dangerous process though. Definitely some safety precautions to be taken and research to be done if you ever attempt that. And remember small batches for your own legal use only.,thedivision,dbwc6a6,1,t5_2xiqd

However just relying on layers of RNG in order to reward your players is beyond stupid. RNG can reward a player on their first time through an event or a player may never be rewarded as RNG just does not favor them.

There is also a massive increase in the amount of players who will intentionally run through your fire as you are either fighting real rogues or NPCs.I think a lot of it is just down to a different style of griefng and the players that do it just want to kill other players but being the invertebrates they are they lack the courage to go rogue and face the server with a timer of their own.

Im not sure what game you thought you were buying.  I dont think its top tier PvP because I dont think PvP in this game needs to be  evenly balanced.  I used to get ganked in the DZ all the time but you know what instead of complaining or avoiding the DZ I put in a bit of time getting good at PvP encounters.Also your point about  of players going into the DZ seems pretty irrelevant to me.  What  of players do you think are currently completing any of the incursions?  Or playing underground?

They get this success by grouping up with other average to above average players and taking out smaller groups usually solo players.  It gives them a sense of superiority and achievement to do a v or v and win.  These are the same players who transfer servers when a better team takes them out make excessive excuses for why they were taken out by one guy in a v such as oh you had to pop a blue  you suck! even though they had to have  players to shoot at one and still all died.  While they may not be able to have success in Battlefield Counterstrike CoD etc... They are able to taste it in the Division which isnt healthy and raises their egos.

Its the whole point.People need to stop pigeon holing with the assumption that there are only two options  youre not necessarily either one or the other. Anyone who thinks that having a PVE only instance of the DZ isnt going to change the existing one is shortsighted to say the least. What it does it make the current DZ? It makes it a PVP only DZ. It destroys the dynamic completely. It means for someone like me I have two options. Either I go into a PVE boredom inducing farming run only version that is all smiles and handshakes with everyone competing for the next useless cache box or landmark that respawns or I go to the PVP version which guarantees nothing but getting ganked or PVP action.Great. ,thedivision,dc37wn4,0,t5_2xiqd

10238749,0,t3_5mler5,gt The tension comes from the   and  man gankPvP squads. Id disagree with this.  Its more the solo players that provide the tension for me when Im free roaming solo in the DZ.  I pretty much know a  man group is likely to engage me in the DZ because they have the numbers advantage.  This is why Id rather see a solo and group DZ first before anything trying for a PvE DZ.  But I plan accordingly I avoid groups and gank squads at checkpoints.  if I see them farming an area I try to stay out of their zone when Im farming.Bigger tension for me is doing an extraction and sitting there waiting for  and a half minutes where I dont know who is going to show up.  Will it be a friendly solo player looking for a spot on the rope?  Will the rogues checkpoint camping  zones to the south come up for the extraction?  Any sign of more than  player and I will abandon the extraction as I can typically hold my own against solo players.All of that is lost in a PvE DZ so I would likely never play there.  But the part everybody in favor of a PvE DZ doesnt realize the DZ is built as a PvE zone with encounters and density to encourage player interaction.  Extractions supply drops dense landmarks NPCs in the streets to slow you down.  All of these have ways of telling where the player population is at a glance from the map.  They built the zone to try and get PvE players to go into a PvP enabled zone.  Because it doesnt work for them doesnt mean they should make a PvE only version of the zone.  ,thedivision,dc4mb96,3,t5_2xiqd

10278809,0,t1_dc8osak,gtIf you split it you would have a PvP DZ with pretty much only PvP. Because why would you even bother farming in a PvP DZ? I think you might be overestimating the number of players that go into the DZ only to PVE the players that would never return to a PVPVE DZ if there were a PVE DZ. I pug or solo when I go into the DZ and probably  of the time I get in groups that want to farm caches and supply drops... and kill rogues when we see them.  of the groups I pug in want to pvp but dont want to go rogue. Theyre PVPlite groups. The other  want to go rogue.That brings up the two types of PVP in the DZ. The PVP hunters players that enjoy hunting rogues PVPlite groups fall in this category and the PVP hunted the guys that like going roguemanhunt and running it off or bunkering down and seeing how many manhunt kills they can rack up before theyre taken down or the server gives up.  Of all the cachesupply drop farming DZ pug groups that Ive run with its extremely rare it has happened once or twice that I get in a group that doesnt want to peel off from cache farming to go after the rogues when those little red dots pop up on the mini map. A PVE DZ isnt going to affect all those PVPlite players that go into the DZ now. It would affect the players that never set foot in the DZ and are sick to death of mission grind. A more probable outcome from a PVE DZ would be far less people grinding missions not far less people in the PVPVE DZ. And thats a good thing for the longevity of the game because mission grind isnt enjoyable enough to retain those players. For the record Im a PVPlite player and right now I mission grind  of my gametime and DZ cachesupply droprogue hunt the other  of my time. If there were a PVE DZ I would probably PVE DZ  mission grind  and PVPVE DZ cachesupply droprogue hunt . Because Im like you I enjoy the danger of the DZ and I enjoy running into players that arent rogue and the excitement and tension that is there. Its the PVE mission grind thats driving me insane. And I look over the fence and see the openworld PVE in the DZ and I want that PVE experience but I cant play my entire gametime with that PVP tension. And the mission grind is becoming too monotonous to continue playing without something changing.  edit I upvoted you because those are valid concerns that warrant discussion. edit I just realized it would very likely have another affect on PVPlite players. A PVE DZ would give them experience with the map. And knowing the DZ map well definitely makes a difference when PVP breaks out. So having a PVE DZ that players could use to learn the map would help even the imbalance gap between hardcore and pvplite players when they do go into the PVPVE DZ. ,thedivision,dc95qtd,2,t5_2xiqd
10279371,0,t3_5mn7ca,Well this is going to be buried and if found it will be downvoted Im sure.   I think the seeker mines need to be nerfed FOR PvP.  Theyre ridiculous right now.  They got rid of explosive bullet stagger for a reason only to bring it right back with seekers.  If they dont oneshot you which is completely lame they stagger you enough to get downed before ever returning fire.  Alpha bridge also needs a nerf or the other set just need to be stronger.    NPCs need to chill TFO with their almost automatic shotguns while at full sprint faster than any agent pegging me with  accuracy from a block out.   I shouldnt be able to outrun my own throw.  Whats that about?  I can literally throw a seeker mine take off sprinting and be ahead of it before it starts to roll?  NPCs are olympic javelin throwers and Johnny Agent cant compete in little league. Let me in the GD checkpoint.  Seriously.  This has been going on since forever.  No aggro in sight but in combat?  Also if an agent shoots me with a pistol let me in!  Hes just being a dick looking at you red storm....  Either make him rogue on the spot or let me in.  As it sits now he comes out fully restoked Im out of everything and headed in.  He pumps one round into me and if I defend myself Im the guy at risk. Thats stupid.   If youre going to keep the DZ as is then make it more rewarding please.  At least for farming.  If some poor schlub is gonna risk it for the biscuit in that fresh hell of a DZ then they should have a chance at something better than what they can get with no risk in the LZ.  The Tommy gun isnt enough its shit and never drops anyway. Make the named weapons worth the gold their printed on.  Theyre crap.  Whats more is theyre rare crap.  named gear is pretty good but there should be a minimum roll on it so the one time you get a named piece out of a quadrillion runs and cache opening youre not selling it right back.,thedivision,dc981dh,11,t5_2xiqd

I am tired of the way PVP works and I dont want to spend all my time learning about builds and the numbers behind how my magical shirt works with my magic knee pads and the stick of shooting with the m of smiting.  I have played lots of DampD and rpgs in my life and as a RPG game the division is NOT one oh it has confusing numbers and millions of combinations so you can run around and roll and jump to fight each other. hell almost as bad as the original dolphin diving of counterstrike.   I want to enjoy the game and a PVE zone would be fun. hell maybe even allow us to team up in PVE to take on the mobs. that is what I had hoped it would be not the steaming crap gank fest it has turned out to be. and I am truly proud of you if you enjoy the DZ solo but you are the small percentage.  I agree with XOXOYOYO that PVE dz is needed. and  I am so tired of  hearing the one percenters go off about the fun things in the LZ  the little bits they added are boring as hell. it is no fun running the HVT or the tiny missions not compared to the  NPC laden Dark Zone that we cannot use.   with the changes to the core game I had hoped we were on the right track. and the core game is so much better but there is NOTHING to do with it. and the DLC has been boring. survival was fun for a couple runs but really you would play that all day ? barely worth the  bucks. so I am not sure if I even dare hope for any changes in . but I come in here and say my piece as the dying of what I think could have been a great game but so far is a Meh game. slowly being killed by the PVP element that just wants more ganking and circus gymnastics in the DZ. just go to youtube and watch the DZ gameplay videos. like retards doing ballet with grenades.

Thats the whole point of the game  to keep players farming for better gear and to keep them going into the DZ to PvP.Warrengate for example allows players to gear up fully not needing them to actually play the whole content.

10334978,0,t3_5nyqmd,The final game models are pretty faithful to the concept art I must say. This particular outfit ended up as the ingame model for the LMB squad leader  chevrons symbol elite and named only though he simply has comms gear and an antenna on his back in the final version. It looks like the massive backpack ended up as part of the medics ingame model though.Now regarding the viability of this outfit for the player most of the clothing wouldnt be too difficult to adapt for the player with the exception of the ski mask. The ski mask would likely cause some major clipping issues with the gas masks all player agents wear in contaminated areas and the Dark Zone so some scripting to disable those would be necessary. Finally though it seems to be more of a gameplay choice to avoid any gear that conceals an agents face. You can see this in certain headgear already in the game like the EOD helmet which has the visor flipped up.

10350317,0,t1_dch2hst,Again I never said anything about killing blows you did. Many games use personal skill rating for matchmaking in fact most all of them with a MMR. You keep going back to kills witch are only valued in the system as one of many sources of XP for the players. In most games that use a MMR are a match based you que for a game you winlow and your rating goes up down. So instead of queuing for a match and gainingloseing rating at the end your MMR it will be updated in real time after each activity is completed. If your solo and and kill a player you gain XP MMR if you die you lose XP MMR. If your in a group playing a healer you may never get a single kill yourself but you will gain the same amount of XP MMR as the rest of the party for participation.If you think of it like a OverwatchRainbowSix game but but after every round your MMR would be adjusted based on your performance. So you could Win the first round and Lose the second and end up as a net gain if you did better in your round than they did in theirs. its just increasing the update conditions from round based to event based.,thedivision,dch9od0,1,t5_2xiqd

On top of that someone getting something does not deny something from another. You have a  chance of getting it every single run. While probability suggests that with a  rate that out of  runs you have a  chance that you should end up with one in that  runs. This doesnt mean that youre guaranteed it in  or  or anything but statistically the more often you do it the more likely you should be to get it because it averages  in . There are dry streaks and there are hot streaks but the chance is always the same unless there is some outside factor that is influencing things but you dont have a sample size to even get close to being definitive other than showing someone got super fucking lucky.,thedivision,dclyxaj,1,t5_2xiqd

DFNC made pistol tanks disappear and made dps minded players create a tank just for damage and not the group synergy.I mean if the vision for PVE in . to introduce high tactics and strategy missions it will need players to think outside the box.

As long as you dont try to keep a static dollar figure especially one thats too low. surely thats how most people judge most forms of entertainment? Was that h movie worth  per hour? sometimes no and sometimes yes. Was the Last of us worth the . per hour I paid for it? yes. was medal of honour warfighter worth the  per hour I ended up paying to endure it? Fuck no. I tend to calculate the dollar value first then decide if it was good value. I also have a minimum If its cost me less than a few bucks per hour then it was automatically worth the purchase.  The witcher  may well be worth  to a lot of people in terms of value but if thats what we had to pay for it nobody would have bought it to find out it was worth it this is something the developers would have known so all size and content was produced knowing full well that they were only going to be able to charge the same as most other AAA games.

10508242,0,t3_5qhe5u,gtMidasWe received a lot of feedback on the healing debuff of the Midas and decided to preserve the debuff idea but with a different angle.Midas Each bullet you hit with reduces your damage by  and your targets damage by  to a max of . The effect is reduced by  per second.I understand Midas Touch and all that but Id love to hear the reasoning behind this in the context of a video game. As far as I see it they changed a perk no one would use due to its negative effects towards the users heal into a perk no one will use due to its negative effects towards the users damage.Only situation I see this being useful is hanging back in cover and debuffing enemy damage.

10531419,0,t1_dd1tcf4,First of all thats a different thing entirely.Second of all that doesnt make any sense. My suggestions make sense because when youre out in the open youre vulnerable and this can affect peoples ability to think clearly which can affect their motor controls  hence the wobbly aimvisual effects. When behind cover you feel safer so these effects are reduced. It makes sense. With your suggestion youre saying bullets should become more effective at penetratingdestroying things because you were behind cover and that your agent becomes less resilient to a direct hit from a bullet because he was not in cover. What?Third I dont think its a good idea. The idea is leading in the right direction but it would create a very cutanddry situation where youre literally at a statistical disadvantage by not sitting on cover. I could see this turning everything into a reenactment of WWI where everyone would sit in trenches for weeksmonths at a time afraid to poke their heads out.Lastly isnt that already in the game?

Youre just going into the DZ to PvP.  There is literally nothing to lose. You can even practice in the lvl  bracket.  Thats what I started to do until eventually I was killing everyone too quickly because nobody knew how to set up their gear.  I moved on to lvl  and Ive had my second character in the  bracket and above ever since.    I still PvP on my main character but Im not roguefighting rogues all the time.  I farm a lot for the DZ funds so I can buy stuff.  On my alt.... I PvP  of the time.  I dont farm the DZ I dont pick up loot.  I just shoot people.  lol.    It took me a while to get good enough and to get my gear good enough to survive solo manhunts.  But man is it satisfying.  And the best part  People who are smart will actually ask you about your gear and how you do what you do.  That gives you the opportunity to teach others how to playwhat to run.  Ive made a few friends after fighting in the DZ.    Practice makes perfect agent.  And dont let yourself dwell on your failures too much.  You WILL bump into really good players every once in a while.  Ive bumped into people I just couldnt kill usually because their gear is just a tad bit better than mine and we are of equal skill or because they are just better than me.    If you go in there with a humble mentality dont underestimate anyone and try your best youll start to pick up a few tricks thatll help you survive.

This change looks like it definitely will knock Pred down a peg but honestly its needed. Bleed is and extremely potent CC in division forcing you to either walk or spam roll both of which leaves you vulnerable not to mention making it impossible to run away. The issue with Pred is that this CC was achieved by no special means. A normal firefight would require no additional effort to permanently bleed your target until one of you dies or you run out of ammo. Thats a big issue. So before we had a situation where Pred was too potent now its the other way.

Even in games like League where you dont necessarily get builds and stuff if a pro player in a tourney takes an off meta pick and does well with it everyone starts doing it after that. Its not about success or strength so much as it is the spotlight and recognition that it gets.

The wellknown secret many dont seem to want to acknowledge is that at least for PvE one can make a viable build with any gear set since enemies dont put up much of a challenge.

Adding a cannot be shot area in front of checkpoints to avoid  player groups camping the spot. Or sth. like a timer that players cant be shot for  sec after leaving a checkpoint or safehouse.. For people who wont do PvP in the DZ give them an option to be in passive mode like in GTA Online. Or give them a seperate instance.. There should be an improvement in matchmaking in the DZ.

10654748,0,t1_dd89xt0,So after quite a bit of tinkering and purchases from vendors I think Ive tailored my Deadeye pretty decently. Im running  crit damage on my SCARH with an extra  on elites. In the firing range Im knocking out k hits.One thing I love about my SCARH is having Harmful  each hit giving me  to apply bleed. Though untested I believe this will be essential in the DarkZone to crippling my targets. Then I built a M Carbon that gives me  crit damage hitting k per hit in the range. I cant decide which I prefer but Im more inclined towards the SCAR for most situations for the quicker trigger pull. One thing that does cause me small pains is having to raise my Aim Sensitivity to  so that I can follow targets while scoped in better. If Im ever forced to switch to my AR for close quarters its spazzy as hell to aim with. It would be nice if there was two different aim sensitivity options one for basic aiming and one for scoped in.

A LMG scaring people into cover wouldnt work and increasing armor when in cover is almost as worse. It has to be something like When in cover your health regeneration fill into empty segments.So we know health is split into  bars. When you arent in cover your health regen kicks in but only fills to that third. When you are in cover and you are patient your health can fill into empty segments and eventually you can heal to full health so long as you stay in cover.

10682161,0,t3_5stz5z,There is a HUGE difference between the way theyre doing the PTS and the CTE though I played a lot on the BF CTE on both PC and XB. The CTE exists months before a patch is released almost as a separate game so you can be playing new maps and new balance mechanics way before theyre launched. It IS possible for Massive to implement a console version of the PTS if they went about it differently because they could wait the  week certification period out and not be in a huge rush when they push a new patch but because they launch a PTS merely weeks before they actually release a new patch and content it doesnt allow them the time to send out patches and wait for it to be approved by Sony and Microsoft unfortunately.Honestly I wish they would do it more like the way BF does the CTE more time to make a new patch really great before its pushed live. ,thedivision,ddhs8hy,2,t5_2xiqd

10684633,0,t1_ddhyxgp,The question of what makes a gear piece good would benefit from a more complex and elaborate answer than I have the time to type today but here are a few quick pointsArmor is important but high armor alone doesnt make something good.Every stat rolls in a range.Firearms Stamina and Electronics for example can all roll anywhere between  and .Depending on the build you are going for some stats are better to have than others and some starts are more important for certain builds than they are for others.For example a backpack without ammo capacity may not be an issue for most builds but it may be the difference between good and garbage in terms of an Alphabridge build.First figure out what you want to do with your character maybe there is a gearset that has set bonuses conducive to that end.Then figure out what stats you want at the moment two pieces with Firearms two with stamina and one with electronics is imo pretty well balanced in terms of unlocking weapon perks. And what attributes you want on your gear at the moment it is a good idea to have Armor as a major attribute on your chest knees back and holster though changes in . will get rid of this as an option.After you have figured out what you needwant on your gear pieces  look at each piece and consider whether it already checks all those boxes. If it doesnt consider whether you can check all the boxes by recalibrating one line item. If you cant ask yourself whether it is a closest thing you have to ideal.

10740881,0,t1_ddnryct,I actually like using all weapon types if I can find one that suits my style. I typically prefer slower rate of fire weapons over the faster ones because of control honestly. I also dont intend to ever get deep into pvp with this game because of the underlying issues of balancing so many different things together as well as the lag issues an arena helps alleviate some of the pvp issues in dz but the lag and all is still very much there.Id love additional utility on weapons I feel like crit chance on smgs is a decent start there since you can more readily run something like self preserved on it and other builds that Ive used in the past without being locked to a cooldown timer and other things. I had hoped that the lmg buff they gave for its passive would be a support ability to push them into a support role but they went with the ridiculously simple damage route. Imagine how different engagements would play out with other players especially if you had an lmg that slowed them down when you either hit them or shot close enough to them to register? It doesnt have to be huge but say if every bullet slowed them down by  up to a maximum of  or  and decayed by x every second that would really emphasize suppressing fire mechanics with an lmg as well as push people into cover or encourage tactical pushes rather than just attempting to facetank. Something they could do with smgs is maybe push their base damage up but make their fall off harsher so that they will dominate in those closer range encounters but outside of m or so they basically fall off hard. I know not everything is perfect or anything but its at least a good starting point to push weapons into more defined roles rather than everything fighting for the same role and  of it falling short of it. Ideally theyd also get rid of the necessity to fight people close up so that people wont just go with the most effective close range weapons because its the only way to actually confirm kills instead of having them just revive right away.Its a tricky spot but theres so much potential here for nuanced weapons and everything and to introduce support roles to things rather than all the guns fighting for damage. I feel like their new caduceus is a good start to that as well I think tenebrae too to a lesser extent. If youre trading damage or something you should definitely be gaining utility or something somewhere else. I dont mind metas or some things being weaker but as it stands every weapon is just fighting for damage roles and thats not good unless theyre all balanced well. I dont mine having a median and then weapons swinging  either way either but that is also not whats happening. At the very least Id like to see higher rate of fire weaker but more burst oriented and strongerslower weapons do more damage and that you would want to combine them rather than only use the fastest weapons because they benefit the most from everything. Its such a basic thing to implement but it would at least be a start too.,thedivision,ddnua0z,3,t5_2xiqd

I love a lot of this game. what i actually want to see is having to deal less with the toxic element of the game. the player base has devolved lately into just pure poison. and i am not talking about here on reddit. i am talking about actual ingame. the players running and ganking the Darkzone.   and yes you can say it is my perception but it is also my friends who have already left the game behind for the exact same reasons. the Ganking and toxic behavior.

So if my rant offended you in anyway i apologize. i like you feel this game could actually be something but as it stands now it is divided and there is just nothing fun to do in this game. with PVP being the next update i will be giving that a pass. i dont see a bright future moving forward for the game and that is sad. i have  more levels to hit  in the underground and then there will be nothing to do in the game. the  level grind has been so tedious but the only really fun content for PVE lately. ,thedivision,ddorcib,1,t5_2xiqd

Then you can work your way to the DZ the speed runners will already be gone  cache survival guys will likely just be finishing up their runs and wont want to bother risking them for PvP.

Ingame most agents wear the watch on their right e.g. character selection but they were advertised as wearing their watches on the left e.g. front cover dont check the back!

Like other people have pointed out the playerbase was dying and if Massive had thought that the game wasnt worth supporting anymore due to a lack of players which I dont actually believe wouldve happened it would be worse. Not everyone plays this game for the challenge not everyone has the time to run Lexington a hundred times each day to maybe get a somewhat decent Barrets. I did play Legendary on the PTS and I liked it a lot. It was actually a little challenging but that was because we did not have time to minmax and we were only  people yet I dont think it was challenging enough. My idea for legendary would be enemies that deal enormous damage. Lets say Snipers that twoshot you if you stand out in the open with  armor and k health.

10898411,0,t1_de432ec,Were talking Massive here it took them a week to fix issues on the PTS that rendered it utterly unplayable. Because somebody apparently doesnt know the difference between addition and multiplication. Funny how everyone on the internet is a game developer though right?The entire storyline of the game is based around the idea of agents gone rogue agents in the DZ murdering each other seems to fit that bill quite well dont you think? The entire DZ itself was designed as a PVE AND PVP area well so was the entire game but well ignore that for a moment like everyone else did taking the PVP out would be idiotic. There would be absolutely no tension or risk in there whatsoever.I think survival should have been designed in exactly the same way as the base game PVE until you hit the DZ then anything goes. However Massive realized that by doing that all the current DZ whine brigade would shit bricks and as a result we have two queues.None of this changes the simple basic fact that IF YOU DONT LIKE THE DZ YOU DONT HAVE TO GO THERE.,thedivision,de43dwi,1,t5_2xiqd
10898905,0,t3_5vq9aa,This is a another game I wanted to love but just feeling let down yet again. Just like The Division. Character movement and handling is pretty bad and clunky. Even at max settings I still feel like I move as if Im in quicksand. Vehicles are even worse especially rotary wing and fixed wing. They created a beautiful world...but theres no depth to it. Why not add villagers that give you side quests? Random events in the open world like Skyrim or GTA or Fallout? The game has been in development for far too long not to have them. Enemy AI is basic. For complex teambased tactics you need complex AI. We dont have that here so you cant really formulate plans and execute them at the level you should be able to. Enemy  spot you shoot you maybe take cover to shoot at you more. Imagine taking a sentry out changing into their clothes then sabotaging the radio system so they cant call for reinforcements before hitting the base proper. That should be an option for stealthbased gameplay. But enemy detection  identification system cant be adjusted for that kind of thing. The cover system is terrible and nonintuitive. Ive seen better muzzle flashes in Goldeneye N. Why does every enemy have the same muzzle flash whether they have an SMG or an AR? I like BDC in a Ghost Recon game and lack of futuristic HUD bullshit but its just not complete. There is no way a AAA game this close to release should be the way this open beta is. I dont think it will have any longevity arcade style shooter whatsoever. Well see how I like it when I play with a bunch of other vets tonight I feel playing with friends is the only real saving grace of this game. ,thedivision,de457x8,5,t5_2xiqd

Also being able to actually kill NPCs to proc Talented to get the party started  is nice. Im really more interested in where peoples skillpower is in relation to their toughness. I can give up some armor mods for more skillpower but itll obviously mean a pretty big trade off in toughness.

10909288,0,t3_5vu485,I play  to  matches a wk. If I survive the first ten minutes I usually make it out but sometimes I have a bad start or two before I can get a solid run going. Take your time and learn the map would be my advice not just loot spawns But also where elites and veterans tend to patrol. If New to it you probably would do well to be fairly well geared before you hit the dz. Try running a few Times with the intention of learning the map both lz and div tech locations in the dz and not really caring if you make it out or not. Once you build some map knowledge work on getting out and then from there work on getting to the dz faster and faster  in pve especially the div tech gets pretty scarce the longer you spend in the lz  I usually enter the dz in all blues and a blue guns just so I can get to the easy div tech before its gone. Also I find it easiest in  man team. Hope this helps,thedivision,de57s1q,2,t5_2xiqd

Usually there are plenty of people for both tho.Easy way to complete is to use battle buddy with support station die then revive and use the  dmg resist to carry the fuses. Then activate laptop and run to the building by the left entrance. Wait for tanks and boss to come by then pop tact. Works well with randoms.If you have a good group tho you can split into  amd get each fuse box in one go and then rush tanks with tact as they spawn and then boss kill boss but team needs good dmg and decent coordination.,thedivision,de93azb,1,t5_2xiqd

I leveled them up long ago so Ive put two gear sets on each that I will never use on my main but are great combos and Ill usually run them on HVT. Super useful to clear up some major stash space.

Wouldnt it make the game pointless to obtain any kind of decent gear...There are other factors that I have a problem with.  being weapon talents. Since all gear is increased to  talents no longer have tough activation requirements which were in place to balance out the which build gets what. For example a high fire arms build wouldnt have the ability to use the talent competent unless it was in the rd free slot... Now all players have to do is farm weapons of low gearscore to get basically free talents which can be a balance issue. Example Competant Adept Intense on a high fire arms weapon. If anything there should be brackets for players to play in like the DZ...Ah well. dont really care anymore I think the game is going to last much longer as massive in my opinion arent good at looking at deep issues and dont know how to properly balance the game.

11042452,0,t3_5xnsns,Past couple times my group has had luck with putting mobile cover extension mod down on the raised platforms right in front of the stage one on each side. It really helps to have one guy running Final Measure to soak up every other grenade so youre not ALWAYS rolling away and can keep up the DPS. Alternate life support boxes by throwing them right in front of the stage in between both sets of mobile cover so both teams get the heal. Coordinate with your team to make sure there is ALWAYS a life support box up. Probably the most important thing honestly. Also Smart Cover is very nice to have same thing shoot it in the Middle in front of the stage so that both teams get it.I was running a k skillpower Tactician build with BFBs for the heavies that rush. If I hit him with one of those and everyone focus fires on the heavy you shouldnt have trouble taking him down. Its nice to have a taclink in reserve in case you need some extra DPS to melt the heavies and  or boss.When snipers appear focus them down first then hit the boss. It seems that a heavy comes every two of his armor bars and  or after a set time. Generally speaking try to do damage to the boss whenever you can because the shocks also hurt the hostage. If you take too long hell die from the shocks alone. It also really helps to have someone running a high damage Sentry build to drill the boss and to help melt the heavy.Ideal team composition is probably  Final measure guys a Sentry and a Tactician  Reclaimer.Skills Mobile cover with extension mod x  or  at least  but preferably  to have a backup life support stations high skillpower Tactical scanner pulse and high skillpower BFB.Dont forget that combat medic will heal your mobile cover for  also works for your shields in the last room.,thedivision,dejn55n,2,t5_2xiqd

11169169,0,t1_dext5ix,While it is always fun to interpret language literally and on its own merit devoid from context...you are not wrong in that respect. However...language does not exist in a vacuum. It is a social construct that takes place within a context and with a certain intention. And it is never used without an audience who use the common understandings about vernacular interpretations. And the context here is that MassiveUbisoft tried to specifically capitalize on the content drought that caused dissatisfaction within the Destiny community. Aside from this article they in fact explicitly targeted their marketing at it in other expressions as well. Their intent was to differentiate from these mistakes. Within that context and with that intent in mind the quoted claim is to be seen as a goal. A goal which they had every intention and expectation to reach but spectacularly failed at achieving. That is the definition of irony.But why stop here? You can have a lot of fun with language in this exact same quote. The implication here for example goes a lot further since not only did they fail to reach their intended goal...they studied hard to avoid that very same failure. Which linguistically speaking means they arewere incompetent from the start. Again...the literal definition of irony. And while we are on the subject of irony...it is quite humorous when you talk about taking quotes out of context. Because that is exactly what you are doing here by extracting them from any contextual meaning and from communicative intent.   You are welcome. Have a nice day. ,thedivision,dey0hwp,11,t5_2xiqd

I rarely have more than one player around I can support and most of the time he doesnt even realise that I am a healer and just runs away from me lol. Also if they go down they just hold space and respawn before i can even shoot my first aid. The amounts of points you get doesnt really feel rewarding.

With a m carbon as secondary with max headshot dmg guaranteed crit after kill. And crit dmg. It can  shot normal elites in dz wt and takes out named elites in  clip.It has enough dmg where I can  shot a player if I pop pulse and tactical link. Its mainly for pve though. It needs to be optimized a lot more. But the general is dfnc for  set nomad for  set shortbow for them sweet nades and a good anything else.

That is with two gear items specd for stamina and all available options rolled for health. A build such as that in combination with a piece of EDR although I currently run with two because of this absurdity in the game atm has no business being oneshotted by anything let alone a skill requiring such ease of use. gt the reason i said toughness is kind of irrelevant is because it calculates with armor.I get that but again toughness is directly proportionate to health and if you adequately knew the current metas of the game right now you would be aware that that includes quite the specing for health. gt now the real reason why i brought this up in the first place is because i am genuinely concerned about the seeker nerf. this community is so used to asking for nerfs instead of letting the meta shift on its own.Thats all well n good but this current manifestation of Seekers is so far out of balance that not only is it too fucked atm but any driving of meta shifts has high potential to also spin things well out of balance given their degree of such imbalance.

11429057,0,t3_6359no,This incursion is the most difficult and requires a team with good coordination and gear. With matchmade groups it can be hit or miss so ideally Id try to run it with people in the friends list. I assume chances of finding capable players is higher in WT than in WT.    Ideally youll have at least one dedicated healer and plenty of DPS output. In the final stage youll need enough skill power for the shield to withstand the MG.  A general tip is to choose the approrite skills fo the different rooms. There are probably videos on youtube of people completing it but below are some tips.     Studio   The corridor features autoturrets that can be blocked using the shield. Protect the carrier and keep the heals coming.  Inside the studio mobile cover actually is quite useful. Make sure to focus the boss whenever possible but burst down incoming heavies and the shotgunners firsts. The waves intensift so try to burst down the boss whenever possible.     Studio   After the fight in the corridor the studio features a wet floor that is periodically subjected to electic shocks. The only safe area is in from of the buzzer seats just in front of the stage but there is no cover there. You can deploy mobile cover there and be safe from shocks. Alternatively use the support station with immunizer mod but dont place it in the water or it wil take damage.  Killing the boss as fast as possible is key otherwise the waves only get harder. The incoming heavy that kills the hostage is priority no . Usually a player using sentry is godsent here plus it may help to have a damage ult ready. You can always CC the heavy with flameflashbang etc. to give your team more time to burst him down.  Beware that after a while there will be snipers on the sides and later on wnemies will spawn behind you on the audience seats.     Studio   The corridor is a DPS check. The incoming rushers and heavies need to be killed. Some CC e.g. flame turret etc. does magic plus it is a good idea to throw grenades in front of the incoming enemies.  Inside the studio get to the bomb and defuse it. Then protect it from being activated. Again a flame turret near it will provide some CC. The priority is to damge the boss whenever feasible untill he comes out.     Final bosses  In the Western studio it is the priority to protect the hostages. When indicated the MG will fire on them and youll fail unless they are protected. To protect them in the last s of the timer use the shield and stand on the marked cross facing the MG and dont move. After tanking the MG it is safe to move again.  Activate the pyrogenics the same way having a teammate tank the MG while another activates.  Once the boss comes out it is generally better to take out all the mobs first. The reson is that once the boss goes down the next cycle will activate and it is hardimpossible to tank the MG if enemies are still around. THis is especially important for the second boss. TAKE OUT THE MOBS FIRST  WAVES for the second boss. Finally kill the boss. Youll need to do this three times for three bosses the last one being a bit tougher and having ocasionally having survival link. If you take him out you basically won.  Note that youll need to protect up to three hostages which is why youll need a capable team each player being able to tank the MG with a shield.,thedivision,dfrgzdh,7,t5_2xiqd
11430422,1,t1_dfrlhrc,gt one asked aboYoure a feminist liberal I can tell. You cant accept reason when presented to you. He used a sane argument where he explained that nothing is fool proof as well as there are things outside anyones control that can happen like DDOS attacks. Also that massive server installations like Amazons server farms can experience downtime. So if we look at this claims rationally he is right. He is one hundred procent right. It doesnt make him a massive fanboy thats just your way of trying to minimise his argument with irrational hate speach like a feminist would. Just screaming on top of her lungs without any thought. You are clearly upset and need to cool off take a break go outside breathe the air. The game will be available soon.Also my personal note on this matter is that this is always the trouble with games that are without monthly fees. Keeping servers up arent free. They cost a LOT of money and maintenance. The payplay initial cost is mainly for production costs and launching the DLC costs are for production as well as keeping the gameservers alive. However a game is produced by a company a company that needs to turn a profit to be allowed to make other games and updates. The server costs I imagine are always quite low on the priority list.

I would also suggest running a pulse unless you play in a group with a tac build that has a max pulse.As far as mods go this is your chance to stack crit damage in as many places as possible. Keep in mind though that most people running  ARs are generally running base damage with damage dealing talents and stacking headshot damage on mods. If you arent consistently landing headshots then this might not be the best way to go. Hope some of what Ive said has been useful.,thedivision,dg4iuzu,2,t5_2xiqd

11668917,0,t3_66fudg,This is the timeline of the games decline The games launch was plagued by laggy servers players unable to log in and constant disconnects common launchday issues Players who could get in would run to the DZ with friends and begin farming bosses DZ bosses at the time were dropping ten or more PxC per kill. Players farming these bosses were able to amass hundreds of them relatively quickly Massive nerfed the droprates of PxC from these bosses after a few days down to three or so. Players who had amassed their stash now had a monstrous lead as other players had no means to collecting gear this quickly The DZ became a hunting ground early on with endgame geared players quickly and ruthlessly gunning down anyone else causing the casual players to drop out of the DZ entirely A backpack glitch caused players to be locked out of this game entirely. Players affected by this could not log into their accounts rendering their game utterly useless. This took several months to fix resulting in a critical hit to the overall playerbase The PC version of TD was riddled with hackers rendering the DZ a nomansland. This took months to resolve and from what I understand is still problematic. Swathes of players dropped out of the game after this. After this was resolved any players who opted to return to this game were significantly far behind other agents. A bulk of them retired entirely. Gear sets were introduced along with the first incursion Falcon Lost. This incursion contained an exploit that allowed players to clear the instance in minutes. Players who used this exploit were able to reach endgame stats far far before other players.  Players who exploited the incursion entered the DZ with a considerable advantage. They were able to defeat other agents without issue causing more casual players to leave. A series of poor content releases poor design choices lackluster items and repetitive missions caused the PvE playerbase to steadily decline. Imbalanced DZ content caused the PvP playerbase to steadily decline.The game was basically gimped from the getgo. The first four or five months were so riddled with livetweaks that gear and items became far too volatile to care about. You could spend days farming for a piece of equipment only to have Massive announce that the piece you just got is going to have its stats entirely changed around. This rendered the drive to find new gear nearzero. The lack of a reason to keep playing drove players away and the genuinely gameruining bugs and glitches drove away swathes of others. The game was halfdead six months in and the lack of anything interesting meant that the player return rate is pretty awful.A pisspoor Year Two announcement basically means there is absolutely no reason for anyone to return. Its a constant decline with no return.  ,thedivision,dgior81,6,t5_2xiqd

All this is doing is making sure that when those weapons are buffed to  that the required main stats increase as well. This has absolutely nothing to do with PVE outside of Last Stand.

11724412,0,t1_dgoxlrl,I dont disagree but I think the economics of the game industry is part of the reason why we see so many turd games.  My guess would be that alot of game design decisions are made against the backdrop of sales and mass appeal partly due to the economic realities described in the video in OPs post.  Pricing a game at approx double current game pricing might remove some of those pressures from the publishersdevelopers and allow the creative process to have a stronger hand in the development of a game.  Yes the game could still flop but I believe that most developers want to make games that they would want to play and so any business practice that would shift more decision making power into their hands would benefit the final product.,thedivision,dgozqmd,1,t5_2xiqd

I have the blue prints but it takes forever rolling and rolling away to get what I need I may have it between all  characters just been lazy lately this build is built around damage with the flip of a piece of gear I can balance the whole thing out I just like the current set up. heres some ideas of what I run with on my high end character when Im not focused on skill power or being balanced as part tank. once load outs are in place in live game it will be easier for me to have    different set ups for this character .. cant wait !and mod wise I am at ,thedivision,dgqf7yj,1,t5_2xiqd

Most people I fight against actually suck at hip firing but when almost everyone you fight charges in and face tanks my bullets so they can get in close and dance around me like a moron it makes the pvp in the game dull and boring.

11767054,0,t3_67wesn,I agree but I think hip fire might become quite difficult on console with these changes. My hope is that most will quickly become frustrated with the huge lack in damage output theyre now capable of while staying moving and ADS more.However the real problem remains the poor server ability to keep up with the sidetoside movement or strafing. When players hip fire in one direction theyre actually very easy to kill. I can even kill them with semiauto weapons even a nonDeadeye SVD or an MDR as long as they keep moving in the same direction. When they start going back n forth though thats when the server struggles and they become very difficult to hit. Its very frustrating with this player base as many of them seem to think that this is what confers a good player when in reality you just have some very nimble thumbs capable of taking blatant advantage of very weak servers. ,thedivision,dgttquv,3,t5_2xiqd
