Good mornings are also good along with GHRs and back extensions. And of corse anything that works your upper back. ,necromancers,d5gdq7t,3,t5_2yxmw
9775452,0,t1_dai0xoc,Oh wow that really sells the idea to me both the bending around the legs and the red face veins picture. Nice man thanks. Oh yea like Im trying to jump huh? Hmm I will try these things. And I know to make sure I keep a neutral spine not over extended Ive had to work on that. When it gets heavy it ends up being all lower back so now I got my cues and I will work on it.,necromancers,dai1gwc,1,t5_2yxmw
