Ive seen demos of what can be done using the Office Graph and it looks pretty powerful its part of the reason were pushing for Yammer  Delve indexes it.As for fostering communication we currently have piss poor communication between teams anyway so even a small amount of people using it consistently would be a plus for us ,servicenow,cltxk37,1,t5_2u3b1

3396014,0,t1_cpf3p92,I forgot a basic thing about list fields. Its not going to contain itil but the sysid of that role.         var role  new GlideRecordsysuserrole    role.getname itil    ...    if !gs.hasRoleitil catItemRecord.addQueryroles DOES NOT CONTAIN role.sysid    Try that out. If theres still problems check on  subCatRecord.sysid in the category query  Im not sure if its within the context of the ltggt block so that line might be executing on the server like this      catItemRecord.addQuerycategory undefined... and if an addQuery parameter has an error in it the query just runs without it.,servicenow,cpfderh,2,t5_2u3b1
6792047,0,t1_d0m5ik2,Thank you very much for your response. Continued testing i resolved my issue. I have the fields auto populate if you enter username name or department or show suggestions in a drop down.When i populate User Affected with caller.name it is just text. i thought it would make the connection to the caller i wanted. but instead it was just test.... So i found a way to actually copy the reference over it seems. ill post my resolution,servicenow,d0m61ag,1,t5_2u3b1

8226407,0,t1_d55m8fd,Thanks I know there is a class. I was just hoping there were flash cards or something so I could be sure I know the little details the class would probably be mostly redundant for me and therefore not really worth the cost.,servicenow,d55uvb2,1,t5_2u3b1

10308112,0,t3_5jri5t,Based on some of your previous comments it sounds like you dont have full access to your system. A quick fix might be to ask your support provider to configure a notification that goes out each time an incident has its priority changed.Metrics history tables etc are the best practice way to keep track of this stuff. If you cant get that though the notifications would at least let you manually compile the report.,servicenow,dccham2,1,t5_2u3b1
