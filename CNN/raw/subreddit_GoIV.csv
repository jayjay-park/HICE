9047559,0,t3_546d4y,updated and tried it out. when i click on it the whole overlay moves to the top of the screen it covers the CP and HP values so i cant see if the values are correct. even if i dont need to correct it. the button also stays on top even when im evolving a pokemonotherwise great like always! D thankssssedit oh i have to uncheck the appraisal to make the box come back down...,GoIV,d7zdeg7,6,t5_3fu8u
9083889,0,t1_d80i2rs,Spoken like a typical programmer.gt Its not intuitive until the user is told  understands the reasoning behind the overlay moving.This is the exact opposite of the definition of intuitive.  If something has to be explainedlearned it isnt intuitive.Sure it makes sense once learned and that is the typical software developer mentality.  However software in todays world especially a utility app on a mobile device shouldnt have to be learned.As for gt What would adding a move up  move down button accomplish? For starters it would have prevented this thread.  When the screen wasnt overlaying where the user expected it to be then they would have seen the button to move it down.  A simple up arrow that switched to a down arrow to indicate which direction it will move when tapped would be obvious as to what is expected.Second there is something not quite working right with this or at least as of the time the OP posted.  More than one person posted stating that it was covering the information they needed.  I also suffered from this initially as well.  The button would make it so they can move it down to accomplish what they want and then move it back.Im not saying replace the automatic movement that is implemented Im saying just put a small up down arrow in the corner of the box to manually move it just in case you need to do something in a different order than what the developer had intended.,GoIV,d83qhnw,-1,t5_3fu8u
