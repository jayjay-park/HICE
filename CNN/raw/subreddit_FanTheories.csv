The Sith and many Dark Jedi followed that school because of the emotion involved.It seems reasonable to me that Mace Windu was investing all his emotion into fighting and because he fought in a way not unlike the sith he could defeat Sidious much more easily.

One thing I disagree with is your assertion that Burial at Sea is a part of the Rapture story. On the contrary I think that Burial at Sea is primarily a continuation of Elizabeths story. True some further details about Raptures history are revealed but the main crux of the story is following the character that we first saw reading a book in her giant statue home.

Machines believe sending assassins back is worthwhile and humans believe Judgement Day can be averted. Both could be incorrect but theres no real indication of that.But if the timeline is dynamic there is simply no reason to claim Reese as the original father. Its an unnecessary assumption to that view of time. If time is immutable and all moments in spacetime are fixed fitting together like puzzle pieces it makes sense to adopt that extra assumption. But if the timelines are dynamic you have to account for not only a single loop but at least two otherwise its not dyamic if not countless more that loop over and over again to somehow against all odds result in the exact original version of the timeline for no real reason.Is it strictly possible that Reese was the original father?

Everything bad that happens is because the Hellmouth is there making it the center character while letting it still remain in the background.Its sort of like the TARDIS in Doctor Who.  Its always there and its always bringing the story places but its usually not a main player in the episode to episode action.

Im surprised the writers were so angry about the purgatory angle.They could have written an awesome story of how it would feel or not to be dead and trying to figure out the whole afterlife thing in the absence of angels and demons and everything else pulling instead from scifi religion psychology literature and medicine.  What is the nature of a soul that it feels pain after death?  Are there nonhumans around?  Could the Neanderthals or similar nearhumans also die the same way?  Could the dead get real information from the physical world or pass it back?  Does time work the same way for the dead?  Could there have been a way back to life perhaps a hint that our ancient religious figures had done so?  Did Jesus spend thousands of years in deathlimbo before figuring out how to resurrect himself?  Could the dead perceive an existential threat to the living andor struggle against it?It feels like the Internet could have been Haha they are dead and the writers would say Yes so?  Its still an awesome story.  Instead they overhyped the first mystery and got pissed that it was too obvious so made a bunch of other mysteries to bandaid over it and handwaved how the story is all about the actors oh sorry the characters and not the original premise of the show.,FanTheories,cfwnfs0,4,t5_2u6rc

The biggest hint to this fact are the inauguration scenes  When Walker is inaugurated when Underwood reaches vice presidency and when Underwood reaches presidency.spoilerDuring each of these scenes Underwood talks to the camera about his progress but more importantly about how corruptible the political system is.  In years to come people will look back on this and see me just at the edge of the frame Within a heartbeat of the presidency and not a vote cast in my name paraphrasing.Underwood is out for power that much we know.  But eventually his House of Cards will fall and all of his evil will catch up with him.  When hes finally behind bars he is confronted by his actions but feels no remorse.  He stays firm in his belief that the power is there up for the taking its just a matter of reaching out and taking it and he was strong and bold enough to reach.So he writes a book detailing his rise to power.  Pointing out the futility of the system how easy to him it is to rise in the ranks highlighting the characteristics needed to succeed ruthless pragmatism and no patience for useless things.We are witnessing his memory of events as he writes his book.  And he is gloating to his audience the American people that he got away with it.... and so can anyone else.,FanTheories,cg4xqw6,6,t5_2u6rc

The amount of people that are interested in seeing a movie crossover like that probably went to see The Avengers anyway. The truth is that it really wouldnt increase the actual population size in regards to the target audience. The reason why The Avengers and films like The Dark Knight for instance break the billion  mark is from appealing to the maximum amount of people and just as importantly they got repeat viewings made by a large amount of people. They got repeat viewings because they were awesome movies but there is a cut off point to how many times someone will pay to see a movie. Unless you are attracting new interest from filmgoers that otherwise wouldnt of seen either of the newly combined franchises then there is no profit in doing it.

910014,0,t1_ch7nqvy,gt Second part unless youre a big fat solipsist  all that stuff is already loaded anyway as it must be being simulated concurrently.I disagree. Lets simplify the thought. Wouldnt it be easier for the universe to render only what is in the visible range of a living being? Even with the incomprehensible number of organisms on this planet alone. Everything from human down to a single plankton would have a render distance that is individually calculated. Everything outside of that render distance does not have to be loaded for the organism unless it is intentionally observed therefore the amount of load on the universes CPU would be cut down drastically. Now when I say observed I dont just mean visibly. Any form of observation by any of the many senses we have. Our senses are just ways that we can collect the rendered data that is around us and convert it into the physical universe.Slap in a interface in which these organisms can react with one another and you have yourself a seamless program. For exampleMe I am here at my desk in a lovely little spot called Quantico Virginia. When I look outside I can only see so far I can maybe see an airplane pass overhead I can see other vehicles and people rummaging about the area but only if I choose to observe those things. The computer is essentially so fast at calculating that the moment I choose to observe them what is rendered by others it synced with what I am observing and my render distance is then enhanced with the help of other organisms. There may be ants on the ground bees in the bushes a fish in the Potomac but until I get down and actively observe them it is not rendered for me and the demand that I put on the CPU is optimized by that. The fish in the Potomac can only see what he observes so his load is extremely low most of the time his program is so well optimized that he barely puts a burden on the CPU. The people in the airplane are almost limited to what they see in the plane and a view of what is down below. Now you may think well that is going to be a lot of load if one organism can see so much BUT NOT REALLY! They see LOD they see a preloaded image of what the world below looks like. The image is just updated constantly based on the input from the millions of observers below. So lets say there is a barn on fire they can see the barn from the plane they can see the smoke that is because they are actively obeserving the area and with the help of the observers down below and a calculation by the universe they can witness the event. And due to the distance the person on the plane is from the fire the load on the CPU is still low again optimization.Lets look at a more complicated issue. This message I am sending you. The interesting thing about the internet data transmittal not infrastructure is that it exists outside of any organisms rendered area. My computer is rendered for me yours is rendered for you but the internet is just a way that we can exchange rendered data across spacetime. It does not need to be observed in the same way that radiation does not need to be. It is all data travelling at a constant predefined speed. My computer is rendered my keyboard is rendered my thoughts interact with the  letters and store the data I am typing in a digital medium that is rendered. I hit the send button now we get down to the base level of the universe the speed at which light travels. This data is then transmitted along using the speed of light as a sort of train which carries it along a series of predefined rendered waypoints until it is then observed by you momentarily linking us as our rendered areas make extremely brief contact.This works for any form of medium a TV show the daily news live sporting events a radio talk show. Its all just data that was rendered stored and sent along the framework of the universe to whoever may happen to observe it. So we are all constantly interacting forming a big picture of this universe that we live in sharing data and assisting one another with processing scenes and events. Together we make this universe together we render everything.,FanTheories,ch7q366,14,t5_2u6rc

915298,0,t1_ch86jdh,Heres the best explanation Ive heard so farTheres a misnomer about quantum mechanics  I hear this in a lot of journals a lot of quantum computer people say this so Ill dispel this right now quantum mechanics is not the physics of the very small. Quantum mechanics is the physics of everything. You have this problem so if microscopic particles are in many places at once living out lots of histories at once and going from place to place without the intervening space and all that and were built out of them why dont we do that? We know why now. We know how the classical world emerges from all of that quantum weirdness. And Im going to give you a handwavy argument not a technical argument. But way back when heres the Schrodinger equation and what it predicts is microscopic and macroscopic alike  I should be in these strange states. Heres a cat alive and dead at the same time. Why dont we ever see that?In the s there was a new field or a new discipline that talked about something called decoherence. And heres the thing if you look at an electron or a photon. An electron doesnt interact with its environment that much. An electron passing through this room will scarcely bump into another air molecule or photon. But a macroscopic object like a cat or any of you is constantly being bombarded by air molecules by radiation fields and it turns out that if you take all the interactions into account of an object with its surroundings and you put it into this equation points to Schrodingers equation  youll find that what emerges is classical like states. And Im going to say this in kind of a funny way what happens is if you have quantum weirdness here cups hands so lets say all of those weirdness effects are in this region of space when a particle comes in points to hands some of that weirdness gets passed out points to surroundings. It doesnt disappear. This idea about the collapse of the wave function theres no evidence for. What we do have evidence for is that the weirdness gets passed out to all these other degrees of freedom  particles radiation fields that cat standing on the floor thats vibrating and when you take all that into account you can see how the classical world emerges right out of quantum mechanics.Another way to think about is energy conservation if I drop a tennis ball from here lifts hand above head why doesnt it come back up to where it was? Because the energy went away? No because the energy went into vibrations of the floor and sound waves and all that  it gets passed out to other things. So this allows for an incredible possibility. If I could put this cat into an ultrahigh vacuum get rid of all the air molecules bounding into it if I could shield it from all the radiation if I could put it on a floor thats really really cold that theres no vibrating atoms the quantum weirdness doesnt get passed out.Now in the case of the cat theres another issue. Even internally the wiggling of its own atoms will get rid of the weirdness.And then he goes on to describe how DWave built a quantum computer. I put that in quotes because some very smart people dont think its the real thing but he explained Schrodingers cat pretty well. I transcribed this talk from a Google Tech Talk Eric Ladizinsky made at the Quantum AI Lab called Evolving Scalable Quantum Computers. Eric Ladizinsky is the cofounder and chief scientist at DWave.I just want to say one thing too  be careful who you take physics lessons from. There are some popsci  scifi people out there who Ive heard say some pretty far out stuff that isnt true at all with regard to Physics. Im not talking about could be nobody knows stuff Im talking about disproven its not true stuff. The only way to really have fun and really get down to the cool stuff in the Universe and get tech like warp drives and quantum simulations one day is to be accurate. But I upvoted you and this thread because even though some people dont know it the simulation hypothesis isnt out of the realm of possibility. Some stuff like the previous explanation of the robotic arm you gave was wrong though.  Hope that helps.,FanTheories,ch8bq9p,2,t5_2u6rc

1064795,0,t1_chp2n1f,They call the MUTO parasites as they find the first eggs attached to the now skeleton of a Godzilla type creature. They state when they find them that there is radiation but it is decreasing as the eggs are sucking it up. Because the Godzilla creatures feed on radiation its body is irradiated so it laid its eggs inon the monster like parasitic wasps etc using the hosts body for food. This is also why the MUTO stole the nuke as it needs to lay its eggs on a substantial source of radiation. The alien theory would mean aliens came killed a Godzilla thing stuck their MUTO in it then left how does that makes sense then ofc it got buried.If the mining operation didnt happen to find it the whole alien plan to stop nukes etc wouldnt have happened. They must be really stupid aliens. Also why leave Godzilla chilling around are these aliens stupid enough to not think he would fight them? Why didnt the aliens put their own radiation source for the eggs to live on then have sensors for when we set off nukes hatch the eggs. This theory boils down to retarded aliens who cant think stuff through.  ,FanTheories,chpbldq,2,t5_2u6rc

The implication from the ending is that the Omega died and its death triggered a final reset.I am not sure that I agree that its deach triggered the last reset it was clearly the Omegas blood seeping ontointo Cage and when Cage died the reset occurred.gtAs for the Rita theory I like the first two pieces of evidence a lot. I think it can be explained away with Rita is just a really competent bad ass but its an interesting theory nonetheless.Yeah I kinda agree with that but at the same time the grenade was actually perfect it stopped the other mimics from being able to be part of the final battle and Rita is just perfectly calm dictating the pace of the battle Just like Michael Jordan on the basketball court..gtI dont think there is much weight to the third piece of evidence as the Alphas main mission seemed to be protecting the Omega. Rita acted as a distraction so Cage could go in for the Omega.This I think is the most important piece of evidence.  The Alpha has a mission it needs to accomplish this mission no matter what he needs to make the human Alpha bleed out so that they are able take earth.  They know who is the alpha is.  That is why she knew that she would be successful at distracting him.  Every other time when she went for the Omega she would get killed and not kill the Omega.Hence why she was calling the shots.,FanTheories,ci2lhrx,4,t5_2u6rc

They run humanity through a simulated history that leads up to the simulated machines becoming sapient and see whether humans once again react poorly.

After Christopher promised to come back something prevented his return. The colony of Prawns failed to make it out of South Africa and humans adapted their captured technology to their own needs which is where we see advanced spacebased technology become available. With advanced robotics came a decrease in humanbased production and what once looked lime a bright future resulted in an economic collapse when manufacturers stopped hiring humans. Fastforward to contemporary Elysium where human labour is now cheap and plentiful but jobs are scarce. I draw a lot of parallels between the District Elysium universe and North AmericaEuropean social political and military upheaval during the First World War and the Great Depression.

1572699,0,t1_cjdc8v8,What the hell made you think I dont know just as much about the force as you? That was rude and unessisary. Time inside the monolith is different Ill grant you that but the Living Force is different than the Father. Father embodied balance and wanted the chosen one to replace him. Anakin refused and Father died via the Mortis Dagger. The Mother was Aboleth and she tried to kill the Son and Daughter or at least beat them up.There is a distinct difference between the Unifying Force the Living Force and the CelestialsForce Wieldersthe Ones. I wont go too far into details but the Living Force is what allows the JediSithadeptsusers to connect to everything around them and manipulate stuff with the Force. Its what gives them their powers. The Unifying Force is a bit differentfrom the wiki This aspect of the Force focused on its existence as the cosmic energy which bound space and time together which whispered the will of the Force into the minds of listeners which connected the past and the future and wrote the destiny of all things.The Celestials and the Oneswho were a species called ForceWielders were connected to the Force in ways no one can really understand and are believed by some to determine the path of the Force. Its unexplained at this point what exactly they looked like and whether they really control all of the Force.Youve misnamed Father as the Living Force and switched the definitions of the Unifying and the Living Force. The Unifying Force is by Jedi philosophy the one who determines fate and destiny thus it is the one who would hatch plans and such.Force Ghosts are individuals who can retain their individualism after death. They can appear anywhere the Force is present and can communicate with Force Sensitives. They have appeared throughout history in many forms on both light and dark sides.OP was saying that the Force Ghosts were the Force reaching through Lukes subconscious and telling him things. Although the Force speaks to Luke it doesnt do that. Force Ghosts are a known phenomenon and we know what they can do. The Clone Wars season three Mortis Trilogy give some information about Celestials and such but that has nothing to do with Luke other than Yoda spending time to tell Luke about the Ones and Luke finding out more much later than Obiwan stopped appearing to him. The clone wars episodes had little to do with Anakin appearing alongside Obiwan and Yoda as Force Ghosts either.Yoda wasnt the agent by the way Luke was. Mortis has nothing to do with Force Ghosts youre very confused.,FanTheories,cjdetu5,-9,t5_2u6rc

Paul Bettany is technically slated to reprise a SECOND role in the MCU with the first being J.A.R.V.I.S and the second being Vision. While speculation suggests they could be more or less the same role at this point it appears to be separate roles. Vin Diesel fits into a very similar situation. Just like J.A.R.V.I.S he doesnt actually have any on screen time and is only a voice. More than Bettany hes barely a voice as he says all of four words in the movie. Black Bolt is almost the perfect role for this. Hed get an onscreen role his only one in the MCU and its a character who doesnt really ever speak and when he does it would be in a way that would completely distort and similarity to his other character Groot. Plus like DaveSilver said interviews suggested it was a temporary role due to other commitments and there were plans to fully work him into the universe. ,FanTheories,cjn6zv5,4,t5_2u6rc

2249674,0,t3_2kx9y6,Gohan had hidden potential since he was a child. He was able to do some serious damage to Raditz when he was only like  yearsold. He was also able to beat the shit out of Form  Freiza after Krillin got hurt. Gohans power is triggered by rage which is different from the normal way saiyans grow in strength. Gohans power only surges for a short period of time while the saiyan battle growth last forever.The reason Goku and Vegeta were able to become stronger than Gohan later in life was because Gohan had no desire to train while the former two did. Gohan got weaker after the Cell games due to this reason. However once his full potential is unlocked by Old Kai i.e. Mystic Gohan form he permanently unlocks his potential. From that point on Gohan would never have to go Super Saiyan because it would have no effect on his power level.Also the only point Gohan ever reached the near death state was during the Buu saga when Supreme Kai had him be fodder for Majin Buu and even then it wasnt as serious as the near death state both Goku and Vegeta had been in previously.,FanTheories,clps5oq,10,t5_2u6rc

2314768,0,t3_2lsjb5,No offense but pretty flimsy theory. The fact that he hallucinates doesnt prove that the murders were all fake. I agree that some things were clearly ridiculous such as the police chase. In the book he details some murders he claims he committed which dont seem plausible a double homicide with a machete at a yacht party etc. but the fact that some of the things he says are true are clearly fabrications doesnt mean that everything he does is a hallucination. The murder of the homeless guy seems pretty believable as he alone and the police arent going to do much about a murdered homeless man especially in the s. The lawyer saying he saw Paul Allen in London is also ambiguous as everyone is always mistaking people for other people this isnt that big in the movie but they deal with it a lot more in the book. I will say however that the cut from the dead prostitute to him doodling is a good point that I hadnt thought about before but I dont think it was meant to definitively suggest that hes imagining everything. I think its quite unlikely all the murders rapes assaults etc. actually happened as some are pretty outlandish and he clearly hallucinates but I dont think theres enough evidence to suggest beyond a shadow of a doubt that none of them happened. ,FanTheories,clxtjna,2,t5_2u6rc

2449461,0,t3_2nk118,Theres been a heroic amount of effort put into explaining quidditch but the basic truth is that Rowling isnt a sports fan. She also either a doesnt understand why other people like sports or  b understands but chose to spotlight Harry to the detriment of worldbuilding. Quidditch is a pure narrative with Harry as the star. Sports of course have narrative elements but they need to start from a structure that makes sense.Two of the more common defenses I hear The seekers team doesnt always win look at Krum. Krum should have been crucified by the fans. He gave up when the game was still well within reach. Its like a quarterback somehow forfeiting the Super Bowl after going down  in the first quarter. Krum should never be able to appear in public in Bulgaria again without strangers throwing garbage and kids spitting on him. Its not based off wins and losses its based off goal differential. Yes real life sports like Premier League football use goal differential. As a tiebreaker not the primary ranking mechanism. To be successful a sport should be satisfying to fans. European sports fans are more tolerant of draws but when people spend money to attend a sporting event they want to know clearly whether its good or bad for their team. Basing a season solely on goal differential makes each game less satisfying and important. A win or a loss is emotionally simple and immediately understandable. You shouldnt have to whip out a calculator to see if your team did well. That would also make it harder to get kids interested.,FanTheories,cmeggtp,61,t5_2u6rc

2482700,0,t3_2nrh3c,Interesting theory! I had a similar theory and your version helped me clear my out.The idea is that all Levines Shock games have the same set of main roles same narrative and little variation. System Shock  Bioshock and Infinite SPOILERS incoming. In a game there can be  exception to the following rules.. Protagonist always dies. SS is exceptionspoiler. There is always an antagonist wearing a false identity which is initially friendly but when revealed antagonist becomes hostile.PolitoSHODAN AtlasRyan ComstockBooker. Comstock is exception he is initially hostilespoiler. There is always a secondary antagonist leading the third side of conflict. The Many Ryan Fitzroy. No exceptionspoiler. There is always the Victim good word! in need of rescuing and unlocking her abilities. Victim is invincible while being in this role but can ultimately leave it.SHODAN starts as victim and gets vulnerable as soon as she shifts to being antagonist Little Sisters and Elizabeth. Harming Little Sisters leads you to bad noncanon ending and initial Infinite ending led people to believe that ALL Elizabeths stopped existing when she got out of her victim role. Bioshock  is exception as it gives you CHOICE to harm victimsspoiler. There is always the Scientist. A person who knows most about whats going on but chooses not to interfere until the very end where her involvement becomes crucial.Delacroix Tenenbaum LutecespoilerFollowing the same pattern in BASYou are the protagonist AND the antagonist youre the false identity!Fontaine is the Secondary Antagonist.Sally is the Vicim.Elizabeth is no longer the Victim she is the Scientst and thats the start of her loss of plot immunity.In BASElizabeth is the protagonist and there already was an exception to protagonist always dies rule in system shock  leading the conclusion that she has to die to fill in Shock plot pattern.Other actors are Sally as the Victim Atlas and Ryan once again as Antagonist and Secondary Antagonist omnipresent Booker as the Scientist.Thats way more dull than your version but at the same time it evades hard to explain Elizabeth is Booker part.,FanTheories,cmimlg4,1,t5_2u6rc

They need to do something like when the simpsons went to australia or new york. The family is the center of the story. Springfield needs to not be featured. They do a movie featuring all the characters and settings. They did put them in alaska for a while in the first film and it was a good idea but they were isolated as they wanted to be. I think doing the simpsons in a family road trip vacation style movie is the way to do. You can really milk the destinations and not need to go through them so quickly like in a  minute episode.

She did write The Third Eye and it does share some similarities with The Matrix but so do a lot of other works of fiction and philosophy. Mostly a techno Jesus messiah figure dying to save people. Storywise the plot is far more similar to Star Wars. Her timelines dont make any sense either. She wrote the manuscript in the early s when The Terminator was already in production. And she supposedly sent a copy of The Third Eye to the Wachowskis when they were still in highschoolcollege. Theres practically nothing in common with The Terminator other than a few mentions of time travel.As for her lawsuit it fell apart when she failed to show up to court and her lawyers failed to present any evidence that a she had any contact with the Wachowskis before the lawsuit or b that the Matrix was substantially similar to her story.

They fuck up and fuck up and destroy every matrix until Neo comes along and strikes peace and a compromise.The robots never needed human heat as even the technologically inferior Zion runs on geothermal energy and they dont need CPU power because even though the human brain processes at something like  miles and theres endless resources they would need.There are levels of survival we are prepared for isnt Youd fuck us up by genociding humans it means we will endure the horror of killing our parents if it means our survival.Smith was the test to see if humans could bring themselves to help and even save robots in spite of what happened.  Every prior One decided to keep the hatred and allow millions of humans to die because they couldnt let go of the hate.Neo had metamatrix powers over machines matrix   and could fuck their shit just by raising his hands at them.  Baby face monster knew this hive mind and was the emissary and another test.  Neo could have won the war by killing baby face monster but struck a deal for peace.,FanTheories,cmy2j7x,7,t5_2u6rc

Yes the events could have happened any number of ways and it could all be a coincidence but we know as fact it wasnt thus Voldemort saved Harry also pushing forward the prophecy that the two will come to battle one another which couldnt have happened had Lockheart grabbed Harrys wand instead of Rons.

Everyone was taking the Ayn Rand approach. Shouting that OP is wrong and theyre right because they feel differently. No one was making any points and they justified it by calling OP an idiot. The writers didnt just give a halfassed response. Giacobone himself said Im still figuring it out. Thats not a vague answer thats straight up saying they dont have an answer at all. Unless people are so arrogant that they accuse the writers of being wrong its a fair statement to say that the end is up for debate.Birdman is not some great philosophical statement. Its a great film with philosophical aspects weaved in. To just show up and shut down OP is going against a key aspect of philosophy in general debating and questioning. To repeat my point on Ayn Rand no one was doing that they were just saying youre wrong because Im right. The thing is its not even hard to argue against OP. I dont agree with him at all. Which is why its amazing no one was doing it. They just called him stupid for not sharing the majority opinion and then jerked over how smart they must be for all having the same opinion on the film.

3425367,0,t1_cpip30h,Okay dumb example that wouldnt occur in practice for many reasons just to give the idea.You have a program that asks for a password when you use it. Not something that checks online that you can use it just something stupid. Hell maybe its a password prompt inside a video game and youre supposed to get the password somewhere else in the game and input it to unlock a bonus.Anyway when you enter the password it has to be checked by the program. For that it has to be somewhere in the programs memory. In some cases its allocated a fixed amount of memory like an array of  contiguous bytes each byte storing one character of the password. Now what if you enter a characters password? In good situations youre not going to be able to do it or youll be asked to enter a shorter password. In bad situations youll crash the game and receive an out of bound exception message or something similar. In really bad situations or good ones if you want to hack the program nothing in the code will realize that youre writing  bytes in something designed to contain only  bytes and itll write the first  bytes correctly while the last  will be written right afterwards at memory addresses that contain data completely unrelated to the password. That data can be things like Code itself assembly that will be run by the program at some point. Change that and you can make the program do whatever you want. Simple options are to make it jump to another part of the code that does what you want. Variables like the number of lives you have in your video game or things like that.So you get the idea. You craft a weird password the letters of the password that go further than the max length overwrite data or code and that makes the program do something you want.Thats the basic idea.,FanTheories,cpiptm7,6,t5_2u6rc

3773338,0,t3_33m3cs,Hes just a kid and he is realising for the first time that there are emotional parts of ourselves that we sometimes cant control. The film is a beautiful symbolic exploration of what it means to grow up. Heres a more detailed explanation I gave in another thread a while ago though please dont read it until youve watched the whole film your post seems to suggest youre partway throughThe whole thing is pretty Freudian and allegorical. Its meant to symbolise Max trying to come to terms with things about his personality that he isnt comfortable with. Things that as a younger kid he may not have noticed but now hes growing up starts to identify his wild side as something with the potential to hurt others in other words the beginning of a development of stronger sense of morality. All the Wild Things represent these negative emotional aspects of his personality  fear lack of confidence etc but Carol the main one represents the key specific problem to Max the one that drove him to that allegorical island  his wild nature.Basically his retreat into fantasy is very much about psychologically reconciling the guilt he feels about attacking his mum. His time on the island mirrors his life before the island  the snowball fightthe mud fight to use one particular example and then eventually Carol falls victim to his wild side much as Max did when he bit his mother. When Max realises he forgives Carol for losing control he manages to forgive himself and after finally finding inner peace can return back to reality.I think its a beautiful expression of what its like to grow up. Its not necessarily about losing these negative emotions the Wild Things are still there they are not vanquished or anything  and its not necessarily about how to control them either. Its about how to live with them.,FanTheories,cqmdzhe,9,t5_2u6rc

Instead he would have ended up wherever the guards were originally going to take him and not at the behest of Sebastian Shaw if Sebastian Shaw is even alive at this point given his own dormant genes.Chances are Erik Lehnsherr died in the camp before Captain America The First Avenger begins.Alternatively He escaped the campsurvived until its liberation where he fled to Sokovia in Eastern Europe settled down had twins and then Scarlet WitchQuiksilvers origins kick off.,FanTheories,cr5g0fu,6,t5_2u6rc

Its the same way a person walking into a kitchen might compliment a smell there even if they dont know it. Say this person had poor impulse control like Zoidberg is it less believable that theyd just start eating whatever smelled good than them being  years old?As for not having anyone to pass down the stories there is a joke that suggests that Decapodians have three parents presumably two who do the conception and one presumably celibate that does the raising. He describes himself as the child of Norm Sam and Sadie. We see him interact with at least one of them during the flashbacks to them being disappointed that he wont be a doctor then being disappointed that he wont be a comedian.Theres evidence that Decapodians age too. Harold Zoids silent hologram is dated . In the  years since then hes come to self describe as an old man. If he were immortal and  years hadnt made Zoidberg an old man when Zoidberg describes himself as a kid in the yeti episode I dont think  years would do that to a member of his family.Decapodians probably arent immortal Zoidberg probably didnt recognize the smell he just ate the smelliest thing in the room like he always does.,FanTheories,cr6s28s,109,t5_2u6rc

4597344,0,t3_3djl8g,ukoalaguru is correct. Its a visual thing to show that stuff is getting intense.In film and television there are a lot of ways that you can show that something is getting intense. Often thats through editing style and showing lots of different angles some of them very extreme angles. However since the show is supposed to be regular we tend not to use extreme angles. Extreme angles arent regular. Thats why the staging of the characters is always so flat.Another reason is that we arent really able to use a whole bunch of different cuts and angles because you have to make a new background every time you make a cut like that. So you cant really make a ton of different angles because those become hours worth of work for a background artist for a background that will never be used again.So if you keep things economical shifting to a red hue is an easy way of increasing intensity while also keeping backgrounds simple.Edit Oh I didnt realize this was supposed to be inuniverse.

4764599,0,t1_ctv4dib,gtThats kind of disconcerting to me depending on how early one starts. Like I would consider parents allowing a yearold to transition to be child abuse or even a yearold. Are there any legal limits as to when you can invert your penisadd a penis? Did you get a lawyer? What was the process like for you like when you started therapy?Its different in different countries and states. But generally you can get puberty blockers at  or something which is revertably as they say puberty will continue if they find out theyre not actually transgender by the time theyre  you can get hormones at  if parents give their consent and you can get surgeries like sex reassignment surgery at  legal limits are you need to have more requirements like letters of approval from therapists and for SRS you often need to have been or hormones and presenting the preferred gender for atleast  years. You might be uneducated but Id appreciate it if you didnt call it inverting a penis there is a surgery called penile inversion method. But this is not actually how it works I wont go into detail. but basically scrotal tissue is used as labia and parts of the gland become the clitoris this isnt any different from born females. I have said earlyer we were all once female bodied. Only with the addition of testosterone in early stages labia fuse into a scrotal sack ovaria become testes and the clitoris grows out to become the penis. So with SRS you dont invert a penis most of the actual penis is discarded the tissue is only reconfigured as it used to be and a hole is made.Lawyers are not needed though in some countries you need to file a name change at the court. In my country you can change your name freely if you are diagnosed with GIDgender identity disorder. The process is basically going to your general practicioner who doesnt have a clue what to do. Ask them to refer you to a gender clinic with a letter. The clinic will ask you on a takein and you fill in a huge list of questions and talk to a therapist. after this you wait and wait until you get another therapist with monthly visits then if they decide this is the right thing to do for you they write you a letter of recommendation for hormones. After you take this letter to an endocrinologist hormone specialist this person will do some bloodwork to check starting levels of hormones and liver function etc.. So after about  months were gonna check how my body is reacting to the new hormones and see if I have to adjust my dosages.gtAlso I recently visiting New York to tour around and there was an obvious transsexual in my tour group. I didnt act mean to himher I didnt give angry glances or anything ignorant didnt even speak to himher. The issue was that this individual was very young. I didnt ask the age as that would be prying in a real social circumstance this internet thing isnt but I knew they were younger than  based on hisher actions with hisher parents. Parents whom I believe were engaging in harmful behavior. It was clearly a boy wearing a dress not a dress for the occasion either a female friend of mine told me later. I dont know much about dresses who... well... it was weird. It felt wrong to me. That was my feeling. But I didnt act on this feeling I kept it to myself. I guess that is tolerance?This is also where it differs for every person I for one dont want to be obviously transgender. She She was wearing a dress which indicates to me she wants to be seen as a female at this moment so Im referring to her that way apparently feels like the urge to express herself is more important than passing. Some do this some people are uncomfortable like that. I wear female skinny jeans everywhere and such but you wont find me in a dress because it makes me uncomfortable to be visibly transgender. Theres another thing even though its super outdated.. Some therapists require you to do RLE real life experience which is basically forcing you to dress your preferred gender while not passing in order to receive a letter for hormones. I think this is a toxic requirement because its dangerous and can get you a lot of harass especially if youre uncomfortable. So its possible she wanted to do it herself but its also possible they make her do this in order to get a recommendation for hormones.You could call that tolerance yeah. I think its okay to feel weird I feel weird around non passing trans people but you wont find me harassing them.gtBut why does it depend on feelings? If a man feels lazy and doesnt want to go to work and doesnt work for a long time is his boss right to fire him? Why do we indulge in feelings so much? Dont you think there are some transsexuals who would eventually grow out of it maybe like a phase I know some people have gay phases during college but because they already took hormones and such they cant go back?Youre right if someone is lazy and doesnt go to their work they should be fired. but being lazy is not comparable to being in constant distress with your body. There is a fix to make me feel at peace with my body this would improve my quality of live immensely why should I not do this?Most people figure themselves out eventually. Im lazy at the moment but theres been studies under younger children and adults who didnt conform to the normal gender expectations. In the children x years who had gender dysphoria theres only about  who eventually come to the conclusion that they are transgender for the rest it was actually a phase. this is why they are hesistant to give hormones to youngsters. In the older category is mostly people who have been dealing with this for a longer time they havent discarded this as a phase around . For most of these people its not a phase. Ive had these feelings since i was about ? so that is  years I doubt theres been many people with  year long gayphases. gtWhat is male? What is female? What if instead of believing yourself to be a female despite you not having any ovaries functional breasts or an actual vagina you just acted as an effeminate male?I do actually get why you would think this way. But I think I have already typed this out quite specifically I dont want to be seen as an effimate male. The disgust I get from my body is not something Id wish onto anyone this is also why I think its important for me to change it. I might not have ovaries I might not have boobs I might not have a vagina. But theres females who lack these things too in my opinion this is not that different. Also Ill have functional breasts hopefully in about a year or maybe two. gtAre you sexually interested in men or women? If its men why not just be gay? You can still engage in feminine actions as a gay man like being a bottom or having a stereotypical female role in a relationship without surgically messing up your genitals. This is very personal I know but its anonymous... have you ever been done in your vagina? Did you transition that far? Can you even feel pleasure there what about your testicles? Semen tubes etc?Im sexually interrested in females so basically that makes me a lesbian. Youd probably say if youre into females why bother transitioning its only going to make things harder! That is right! Its going to be harder but again I value my own feelings more then maybe ever having trouble looking for a partner. I have a girlfriend as well and im . sure she wont leave me because Im transgender but who knows if it happens to fall apart Id rather be a single girl then a normal guy who can get with females easier.Its okay I dont really mind to answer any questions. But as Ive already told you Im still early in transition so I havent had any surgeries done. BUT Ive read about this from others so many times the time Ive put into research about this is ridiculous. Anyway most vaginas dont have many nerves inside the canal. This includes assigned female at birth people and transgender girls. It is possible that you can not get much pleasure from a clitoris made through SRS but most girls have great sensation there. Its also notable that your orgasm will most likely change according to hormones so trans females get an orgasm which is closely to the normal female orgasm ofcouse it cant be said exactly but females and trans females often describe their orgasms in a similar way. different from a male orgasm. Testicles I wish those were gone because theyre harder to hide than the rest. But during SRS testicles and semen tubes are removed.Why I wont go looking for a more dominantmasculine woman? Easy because thats not the way I roll. I am attracted to femininity not masculinity. I am more attracted to femininity so I often choose feminine girls. Besides that Ive got a healthy relationship. The thing you are confusing here is sex and sexual orintation.Sex and sexual orintation are not really connected my sex is female and my sexual orintation is also femininity. I am who I am and I am attracted to what Im attracted to. Just because Im feminine myself doesnt mean it would work between me and a dominant woman. Dominance is not the problem I could live with a dominant female. However even if the female would be the dominant one I would still be seen as the man and I dont like that.PART ,FanTheories,ctv4ecm,1,t5_2u6rc

That is if Rust sees the outside of his story then he can comment on the outside of his story. But if hes in a story then he cant control anything which means he cant be truly selfaware because hes essentially writtenprogrammed to think he sees the real reality.Likewise Ray saw his death by having a discussion with his father in a place outside the story... but by being on the show its actually inside the story and thus destined... and therefore not and never a realization that the character can or even should growlearn from the experience.I like where this is going though.

His innocence pureness and naivete are part of what makes him endearing and why everyone even former enemies loves him so much even if it causes him to be a careless parent and poor strategist.  I agree with your OP text Saiyans are biologically uncaring parents but disagree with your thesis here.  gtGoku being very naive and not really smartis really a huge important essential part of Gokus character.  If you lose that aspect of Goku he doesnt become Goku anymore.  Hell end up as just a generic fighting hero with no personality and DB loses part of its charm.  Its even in the Japanese lyrics of the DBZ opening songgtCHALA HEADCHALAgtNo matter what happens I feel like its no big deal!...gtCHALA HEADCHALAgtId rather have my head be empty so I can stuff it with dreams!And HEADCHALA or hecchara  also means something like I can take it thats no big deal in Japanese.If hes selfish its only because hes so happygolucky and such an airhead.  But his selfishness only extends to the desire to train eat and sleep.  Outside of that hes an ultimate good person who thinks nothing of sacrificing things for the world.  But your OP text is still right which is that he doesnt put his family above the rest of the world.  To him his family and Chichi are like bros.  He doesnt feel the need to spend extra wife time with Chichi because like you said hes an uncaring parent and I extend that to say that hes an uncaring husband as if the Saiyan race and militaristic way of life had any need to place importance on husbandwife relations.  In fact IIRC Goku or it mightve been Chichi? once said one of the happiest times of his life was when he just got married to Chichi and everyday was just training and sparring between the two.  Thats his idea of a honeymoon with a wife.  Its training.  Not sitting around on a couch talking about husband and father stuff.

Were making logical rational assumptions based on the reality of the environment. Youre saying that the dragons dont eat humans because we never see it. I consider that to be a logical fallacy because we see much evidence to support the idea that dragons do eat humans or at least did before Hiccup came along. Weve seen dragons make focused concerned attacks directly on humans weve seen evidence of dismemberment due to dragon attacks and weve seen a dragon make every attempt to eat a human. Yet dragons dont eat humans? Come on.We dont see Berk residents having sex but we know that they do because well people. Weve never seen a Berk prison either does that mean theres no crime in Berk? There are some things we simply dont see in familyoriented movies purely by the nature of them being familyoriented but that doesnt mean that those things dont ever happen. Logical extrapolation of the human condition must mean that sex and crime happens in Berk even if we dont actually see it. Same thing applies to the dragonseatinghumans thing.gtIm saying that whilst dragons did attack and perhaps eat  or two humans their primary targets were not humans why? Humans were tougher and fireproof compared to sheep and from an animals perspective hunting the prey with the least amount of effort but most gain quick strikes at sheep without engaging in actual battle is the most efficient way.Sure. Survival of the fittest and all that absolutely. But again weve seen dragons go after humans as primary targets. We saw it in the first dragon attack on Berk and we saw it in the Red Death attack on the island. Given that weve actually seen it happen how can you say that it doesnt happen?gtIt is said in the movie they attack vikings in fear needing to feed the red death.

Vaders big plan was for Luke to be carbon froze so he could safely be delivered to the Emporer but had the whole process tried on Han first to ensure it worked  Whilst also offering Boba sufficient compensation if the process went wrong. In the end Jabba pays Boba the bounty money for capturing Han as well as a bonus from Vader and Hans frozen body serves as a warning to anyone who thinks they can get away with skimping out on one of Jabbas jobs  Hans body probably means more to Jabba than the cargo he lost in the first place.,FanTheories,cwj40y8,1,t5_2u6rc

6007327,0,t3_3xqgmz,I see your Rey Origin story and raise you a Rey and Ren origin storyKylo Ren saved Rey and hid her away on Jakku.Rey has the flashback where she sees the knights of ren standing over the dead at the moment of betrayal. But doesnt this mean she was there? She would have to have been at the Jedi temple in order to have seen this happen so perhaps she was in training as a Jedi along with Ben at the temple? If she was there how did she survive if Ren was right there standing over her unless he let her live?Reys proficiency in the force could be explained away by the fact that its just dumb movie power creep but I like to think there is another reason She has been trained as a Jedi and her connection to the force has been nurtured since birth. She was the youngest of the Jedi apprentices and the first true Jedi young enough to gain the full advantage of Jedi philosophy and training. Perhaps her natural connection to the force and proficiency was another factor that drove Ren to the edge of the cliff of inadequacy He knew she was more powerful than him and it was tearing him up inside that he would never be able to fulfill the high expectations of him as he watched her take to the training so naturally.When the betrayal happened at the temple Ren could not bring himself to kill a defenseless child or perhaps never wanted to. Maybe his entire turn was partly to protect her from the failure he imagined against the empire. He brings her to Jakku and tells her that he will come for her after he completes his mission.Either way Kylo Ren ABSOLUTELY has some sort of connection to Rey as demonstrated in the scene where he destroys the consoles to collect himself after hearing about the failure to capture the droids. After a girl is helping them escape he has a complete and utter loss of composure and surge of urgency and force chokes the officer while asking What girl?!.I am convinced that Kylo Ren is consciously making mistakes throughout the movie to help his friends and Rey. Why after experiencing the mind control power Rey is capable of does he leave her in a cell with a single stormtrooper? Why when hunting for the disk does he focus on the pilot and ignore the droid he knows has the map? Why is he consistently telling everyone to bring the escapees to him instead of prioritizing destruction of the disk? How could you make all these rookie mistakes unless they were purposeful? ,FanTheories,cy73b6q,12,t5_2u6rc

John Ruth does take his pistol.  But Oswaldo offers zero resistance and just hands it to him.  The pistol he shot Mannix with was a smaller one he had hidden.

The will to power is why so many Sith have combat focused force powers but just as many Jedi have extremely potent more peaceful force abilities. Over and over Buddhist and Daoist themes. Cycles of death and rebirth. The universality of pain regardless of how powerful you are. In Daoism the Dao is not good or bad it just is. In the Star Wars universe the Force is the stand in for the Dao.

His other lip sync scenes were only mostlysynched not perfectly so but they clearly were in there. What is your alternative suggestion for him moving his lips so much and the focus on it? Again you said they did it on purpose.gtAlso this is in attack of the clones. I thought George abandoned that story.He changed the script so that Jar Jar wasnt in things so much but he retained the fact that he is a Sith and working closely with Palpatine. It would have been a really cool reveal to find out hes actually evil and go back and watch all these scenes again and notice his powers. I had fun seeing all the clips in this new light anyway.gtBecause it is just part of the movie. Movies cut to peoples reactions! The point of making his mouth move is to make him look realistic not a stationary amphibian.gtPeople talk with their hands especially politicians giving speeches. But JJ can influence thousands of people just by waving his hands.Yes they do but when seen in combination with everything else its just obvious. Youre trying to hard to explain it away when it is clear thats what George first intended to do.Always two there are Same scene just after Jar Jar and Palpatine standing next to each other Then youll probably say but why was Darth Maul there if there are only  etc but the Sith havent always followed that rule to the letter and there is just far far too much evidence for Jar Jar being evil. If it was just one scene then fair enough it could be coincidence but he is at the heart of all the pivotal political moments convincing people.

6327702,0,t3_42aqbg,Darth Maul had a single purpose... a kickass laser sword fight to show the difference between the old men untrained youths and cripples in OT with the Jedi and Sith in their prime.Parks makeup was designed for ease of movement and maximum longevity. Keeping his forehead and face free of prosthetics cut down on the time he had to spend in the chair and the number of times itd have to be reapplied. Keeping the horns small and unobtrusive let him walk around in a hood until the reveal.Sure Lucas should have given him some CG horns like Jar Jars whole body but it would have taken a lot of time and effort.Dont get me wrong I think Dooku should have been an ally of Sheevs and in on the plot... but he shouldnt have been as strong as Yoda already capable of force lightning and eager to become Palpatines apprentice. Dooku should have talked shit and then when it came to the heavy lifting Maul should have stepped out of the shadows.But thats story criteria. Lucas had toy criteria in mind. He already knew if he used the same bad guy for three movies kids wouldnt be able to convince their parents to buy them new versions.

But I think Jo deliberately made it ambiguous just as she made it ambiguous as to whether Harry actually went to a limbo world and conversed with Dumbledore. One of the recurring themes through the series is ambiguity as to whether there is actually life after death. There are ghosts portraits and priori incantatem shades but theyve been established as echoes of the people they represent. Theres the Resurrection Stone but its never actually stated whether the spirits that the stone summons are real or not or from where theyre summoned only that they look more real than ghosts.So Im willing to bet that whether it undoes the pathos or not that Harry was just unconscious in the Forest however you could make an argument that its impossible to say just as its impossible to say whether there is life after death in Rowlings world.,FanTheories,czsm53t,4,t5_2u6rc

Im pretty sure that theres discussion in multiple spots in the books where Dumbledore or others comment on how difficult its become to find a qualified person for the DAtDA position.

Hermione however said is a voice somewhat higher than usual I think youre being a bit unfair. Professor Dumbledore obviously thought he was the best man for the jobgtgtHe was the ony one. Gettin very difficult ter find anyone fer the Darks Arts job. People arent too keen ter take it on see. Theyre starting to think its jinxed.So aside from Snape Lockhart was the only applicant. Dumbledore knew the position was cursed so giving Snape the position would have meant probably losing his strongest trump card when it came to the endgame with Voldemort.

The BOS always seemed meticulous about their own history and Maxon and the LW had to have some further interaction as the Capitol continued to change. Personally I like to believe the opposite of what you said that the LW and Maxon got along. The LW infected the purifier with the modified FEV at the end of . A young Maxon could witness the benefits of the Capitol Wasteland being cleansed of super mutants and other undesirable creatures then decide that this should be the Brotherhoods goal everywhere.

So to solve this problem the universe is trying to kill Peter Parker by creating deadly events for him either turning his friends into villains or killing them through collateral damage.

7509503,0,t1_d2vpwwh,gt Caps last memory of institutional control was SHIELD which was corrupted. The whole reason he reacted the way he did was because of the events of Winter Soldier. EDIT Especially if once in the time that theyve know each other Banner has shared anything about General Ross.Cap went on missions for shield beating up people he believed to be evil and trying to make the world a better place as best he could. Then he found out that he had been serving Hydra and didnt even know it. He started his career fighting Nazis he accidentally spent a while serving Nazis surely he of all people should realize that the philosophy Its okay if some innocent people die in my crusade to make the world a better place according to my definition of whats a better place is unacceptable. As for personal reservations about General Ross that would make sense if the Sokovia Accords were his personal work or if they would place the Avengers under his command but he was merely the messenger. The oversight however would have been by an international panel and the accords were desired by almost  countries. Again it would be understandable to object to a specific form of oversight but Cap rejects any oversight. He doesnt even bother to read the accords.gt Cant coordinate with police when youre no longer official. Sharon gave him the intel under the table but as hed not signed the Accords he was technically a fugitive.He could still talk to them and let them know that Bucky has been his friend for  years and that hell try to get Bucky to come quietly if they dont storm the place. He could also have afterwards told the police that he has reason to believe Bucky was framed instead of knocking  of them out for doing their jobs. gt If especially after the airport battle Cap picked up the phone and called Ross Tony or even the walking computer would anyone have believed him? And even if they did how much time would have been wasted in convincing them?They may not have believed Cap but its not like making a  minute phone call would have hurt them in any way. As for how much time it would save Cap didnt need to convince them he was telling the truth he just needed to share the intel he had with the people who could actually make use of the intel. The people they would have shared the intel with were the ones with the supersonic quinjet that they needed to steal to get to Siberia as well as some supersonic suits of armor. Instead of the avengers just sending any one of their  heroes to the bunker to stop a guy who has no superpowers Cap gets Hawkeye to round up a crew including breaking into the avengers mansion while Tony who is unaware of any need to go to Siberia goes to New York to recruit a teenager during the time that they all could have been flying to Siberia. Zemo drives there and still beats them. There was no logical reason for Cap and Bucky to be the ones who stop Zemo since as soon as Zemo was apprehended Buckys name would be clear. ,FanTheories,d2vsjvd,10,t5_2u6rc

7650542,0,t1_d3bp97y,gtThe process spoken about throughout the series was thought to have involved dragon fire but also included others techniques or some types of sorcery. If it was simply a dragon blowing fire wouldnt any enemy that was destroyed by dragon fire on the field be a corpse holding a Valyrian Steel blade? Couldnt someone just go around collecting blades that way? Or wouldnt the Targaryens have taken all the blades they could find and have the dragons turn them to Valyrian Steel? This is just not a likely concept. The process was lost with Valyria and if it was only dragon fire then people specifically the Targaryens wouldve liekly figured out that process already. I think this whole idea is just wishful thinking to support one theory but when you dig into the details the idea doesnt seem very plausible in the context of the story.I see what youre saying but if anyone had the means to accomplish this it would be AegonTargaryens as they were the only ones with the one of the necessary components that being Dragons fire.  Perhaps he didnt intentionally do it it just happened.  Or maybe they tried to recreate it but could never figure out how.  The Targaryens originate from the original islands of Valyria so I really dont think its that far of a stretch to think they could accomplish it.  gtI get that show doesnt equal books all the time... but I really dont support the notion that they would change something so dramatically important to the central plot of the story for the show. Characters are different paths are different but everything is leading to the same ending in the shows and book so I avoid theorizing how the show might do something different because of some random details they have changed. If youd like to interpret that way I wont argue but that is extremely doubtful. Neither would I but just based on what you see the Iron Throne is not comprised of  swords theres no way in hell a throne that small is a thousand swords worth of metal.  And by GRRMs own emission the Throne we see in the series doesnt match the Throne he envisioned with the books.  The one he had thought of for the books would have definitely been comprised of a thousand of swords according to the wiki the Throne on the series is something like .  As far as the books and show ending at the same place I wouldnt be too sure about that.  Along the same lines maybe but theyve been known to change things up.  We know the series is going to have to wrap up well before the book series is completed I doubt GRRM would even let them spoil his true ending for the books.  Theyll have to devise an ending for the series theyve been working on not the ending the books intend. ,FanTheories,d3btogd,1,t5_2u6rc

The BS medical things he says arent even close to what hes actually doing or what he actually thinks he just knows that the actors businessmen and others who he treats know nothing about medicine and will trust him as their doctor so it doesnt matter what he says. Very occasionally we see him act competent and like he actually cares about his patients health like when he tries to get Jenna to sleep after an experimental medication she was on was shown to be very dangerous.

7818100,0,t1_d3uqofh,Firstly the story isnt about what you believe. Its the writer trying to convey a message. And Having the ability to choose is absolutely what the story is about how is it a story about god if we remove that? Both stories being viable is also actually incredibly important to the story. I dont know if you believe my point which was that it was a conscious decision to have the second story be bad The story isnt told from pis perspective ts way too short it feels intrusive having the Japanese reporters there. The whole situation was made to feel uncomfortable.But anyway Id rather argue the theme of the book because i cant really say it was a conscious decision although to me its the only thing that makes sense. Tbh i did.nt like the parts between the island and the hospital but liked the hospital scene so maybe it wasnt intentional.But never the less the fact that both stories are viable is important to the message of the book. Its about faith as literally everyone says. But with your version its saying that faith is denying reality. That faith is choosing the first story despite knowing the second story to be true which is a bad message. With the version Im saying and that sparknotes agrees with is that faith is choosing to believe the first story despite knowing that the second story is probably true because its the story that makes you happy. Its the difference between intelligent design and creationism. The first says wow god made humans through evolution. That the chances of there being life and such is so small that there must be a plan. The second is spitting in the face of science and saying evolution is the devil trying to trick me.That is actually a crucial and conscious decision. And like i said the banana scene is the most obvious piece of evidence that this is the case. All we need for the first story to be a lie is the omission of the scene with the banana being found to float. Then we have two stories one viable and one not. But instead yann martel goes out of his way to say that the banana did float. A scene that has no place in a novel about someone creating an imaginary world because they cant deal with reality which is part of the reason it was left out of the movie. And its the scene that shows why its a book about choice. Someone in this thread mentioned signs but a quote from signs funnily enough is probably one of the best to convey the idea behind the bookPeople break down into two groups. When they experience something lucky group number one sees it as more than luck more than coincidence. They see it as a sign evidence that there is someone up there watching out for them. Group number two sees it as just pure luck. Just a happy turn of chance. Im sure the people in group number two are looking at those fourteen lights in a very suspicious way. For them the situation is a fiftyfifty. Could be bad could be good. But deep down they feel that whatever happens theyre on their own. And that fills them with fear. Yeah there are those people. But theres a whole lot of people in group number one. When they see those fourteen lights theyre looking at a miracle. And deep down they feel that whatevers going to happen there will be someone there to help them. And that fills them with hope. its not about denying reality its about understanding that truth is subjective and were never given the answers we want. So its ok to believe what makes you happiest. Thats almost a positive existentialism take on religion. And its actually kinda supported elsewhere with the island being a metaphor for religion implying that faith should be personal and not reliant on othersPs it shouldnt be relevant but if it is and Im unintentionally showing bias Im an atheist,FanTheories,d3uti4f,1,t5_2u6rc

That rubs off on Hank and wants Bobby to be the high school jockathlete instead bobby loves cooking over the stove is the school mascot wants to be a rodeo clown and the kid who takes womans self defense classes. All of those thIngs Hank couldnt fathom to do and seems embarrassed by it until he accepts it... something Cotton couldnt do all the way to his death. Your theory may have some backbone and is definitely an interesting thought. But Cotton was a stubborn ass old man and wouldnt accept Hank for what he is I believe he lets all his expectations go once he had a grandson and would undoubtedly publically love Bobby for who he is... ,FanTheories,d4crut2,8,t5_2u6rc

Slugs grow eat the host ie. Remember Barbara? A BIGGER slug crawls out and then turn into the eggs eggs hatch out comes a Demi. I think what the biggest mystery is what the tube like thing is.

They kinda give the viewers a toss up decision of believing Terrys sister when she said that Terry had a miscarriage in the third trimester or that she had the kid Eleven and they used the miscarriage as a cover up story like Hopper questioned. Two theories on Will  He will become the demogorgon or something along those lines.  He will be drawn back to the other side because of the brief switches of the alternate reality. Dr. Brenners experiments were to try and understand alternate universes and different forms of rifts and he used these patients to access them. Eleven is just the number patient that she is because he has been doing experiments for many years by the time he got to Eleven. The others were trying to access these portals but never could because they wouldnt cooperate properly or they wouldnt make it back alive. Eleven was different because she actually approached the demogorgon and by making contact with it opened a portal that would later on ruin the lives of the people of Hawkins. When Eleven sacrificed herself to defeat the demogorgon she didnt just disintegrate both her and the monster she actually just teleported herself back in time and sent herself and the monster back to when she was in the tank and first made contact with the demogorgon. That is why she always knew what was about to happen and where to be when needed. I have more theories but I need to pack for vacation because Im leaving in  hours.

8802994,0,t1_d75xkmm,Yeah plus OPs interpretation of Barbs attitude seems just way off to me. Not saying OP is wrong just that his analysis is heavily skewed. OP thinks Barb was scandalized that Nancy made out with Steve because shes a prude and didnt approve of making out with anyone. I took it as the making out was fine she just didnt approve of Steve... hes a typical popular womanizing high school boy and she doesnt want to see her best friend get hurt. OP says theres a direct correlation between Barbs screams of desperationpain and Nancys enjoyment of sex with Steve I didnt see that at all. Plus Barb trying to stop Nancy from having sex had nothing to do with her being prude and disapproving of sex it was because Nancy explicitly told Barb to not let her doing anything stupid! She even called her her guardian angel! What kind of a friend would she be if she abandoned her drunk friend to this dude after being specifically told hey dont let me have sex with this dude?,FanTheories,d7600sj,7,t5_2u6rc

They use dramaticnarrative elements to tell a story make it more interesting etc. This particular element is the filmmakers way of paying homage to Close Encounters of the Third Kind a movie I suspect you have never seen. In the movie Richard Dreyfusss character has an overwhelming compulsion that makes his friends and neighbors think he is crazy. What he does turns out to be very important later in the film. Although the lights may not make perfect literal sense I think they work just fine to explain the world and make it more visually compelling and pay homage to yet another s film which is why I love the series.,FanTheories,d7cx460,-9,t5_2u6rc

Its hardly a stretch to believe that Rey not only could hold her own against him but might have even been at a slight advantage from the start due to his injury.And while I wish it had been established more in the movie theres evidence that stormtroopers are trained in melee combat as well I think its shown in a comic book tiein and TRR or whatever is probably not some special class of rare meleetrained stormtroopers.So basically I dont get why people act like it was lightsaber master Kylo versus two crosseyed fuckwits.

As in she can repair the Falcon and she quickly learned to use the tech on the freighter Han is on.  Obi Wan is never shown to have any mechanical aptitude he doesnt even do simple fixes.  The only Jedi STEMlord in the series is Anakin.  B.  She has a very strong very personal reaction to Lukes sword.  It wasnt a random Jedi sword it was specifically Lukes and Anakins. Why would a person even a Force sensitive person react to a strangers sword?  As far as Ive seen the cases of a weapon being used by a Jedi are either family weapons Skywalker or a sword one makes for oneself.

Cracked stole the theory from Reddit and now were stealing it back.Short Answer No. This was one of the dumber theories.The long answer is The easy answer to disprove this is Why was it only the Dursleys effected? Sure they had the most exposure to him with  straight years but no one else preHogwarts was negatively effected in their temperament Mrs. Figg was only mean to him because she thought if she was nice the Dursleys wouldnt bring Harry over to her anymore. and no one at Hogwarts or the Wizarding world were negatively effected.  Lastly Dudley Dursley debatedly had an improved relationship with Harry preremoval of Voldemorts soul. If the soul was what was influencing Dudleys malevolence their relationship wouldnt have improved until post Battle of Hogwarts. Petunia had a long seated resentment stemming from Envy of her Parents attention to her witch Sister. Mr. Dursleys whole family are dick bags Look at Aunt Marge for example who believe in looking as proper and normal as possible One of the reasons Petunia likely married into the Dursleys in the first place and Dudley was a spoiled rotten bully of a prat who was a dick to everyone.

10186519,0,t1_dbylzuy,Ive seen all except Agent Carter so I lack knowledge there.  This is more of a no prize type theory in which I try to explain the coincidence of the super soldier serum working on Bucky and how Cap and Bucky are not only the two most successful Super Soldiers with little to no physical malformations but are also two best friends.  Especially since all of these things would have to happen off screen for it to mean anything but seeing as there was a lot of time between World War  and Present Day in the MCU any of these theories could be true.I know Erskine initially did pick Rogers along with a handful of other recruits who were also meant to go through the Super Soldier Serum procedure should the first recruit succeed but Carter was very much involved in the training and choosing the first recruit along with Colonel Chester Phillips as the three of them were pretty much spearheading that SSR experiment.I say proto Super Soldier Serum because you are right she did age normally but she was always a little bit faster and a little bit stronger than most of the opponents she faced giving her a consistent edge in battle. Also while it can be assumed that Cap and Bucky dont age like humans do we cant actually know that since theyve been frozen constantly and consistently so as not to see their aging in real time. Personally I think Zola was setting up Bucky to be the new fist for Hydra behind the Skulls back because I think Zola suspected the downfall of Hydra as soon as Red Skull started pushing him out and starting show his true colors.You are right about the Winter Soldier Red Room and Black Widow part of my theory.  Theres nothing to show that he was involved besides out knowledge of their comic book history.  But given the fact that as far as humans go she exceeds most feats done by the best of us it can be assumed that while Sterilization was definitely a part of the Black Widow process it cant have been the only thing involved.

10198419,0,t1_dbwioav,Yeah I think thats part of whats makes Star Wars soft sci fi instead of hard. If ships can go FTL then you could make big space rocks go FTL which means you could smash them into planets which makes the Death Star meaningless for multiple reasons. It doesnt do anything that a FTL massive rock couldnt do just as well and I dont care how armored it is it would also be very susceptible to the same thing! I guess for the second part it might be difficult to get a firing solution on a moving target thats light years away but the Death Star doesnt seem to be very maneuverable and information definitely seems to travel FTL. If hyperspace is another dimension that doesnt interact with matter in ours then why couldnt they just come out of hyperspace directly inside the ship? Maybe with a drone containing a nuclear warhead? The real answer is of course that all of these things would not make for a very good movie and are not meant to be thought about too hard. ,FanTheories,dc01pwi,1,t5_2u6rc

Charles who is ostensibly the mutant most concerned with human life lost control and killed humans.

Dont get me wrong both shows are excellent in their own way but I still feel cheated a bit because the D show captured what I felt was war in the clone wars and the  other show captured everything else. ,FanTheories,dfyk5f2,32,t5_2u6rc

11633805,0,t1_dge4yzf,Thank you so much!QuiGon I feel is more important or will be than many people are giving him credit for. He signifies a shift in the Star Wars canon and lore on the part of Lucasfilm or so I believe towards introducing Grey Force users in general on a more widespread scale. Just as many people speculate that JarJar was originally intended to be a secret Sith Lord. QuiGon was also an important figure as ObiWans teacher and wouldve been Anakin Skywalkers teacher as well had he not been killed in combat by Darth Maul.Hes QuiQon is a bit of a dark horse to me a majorly overlooked character typically in the Star Wars lore who will prove to have more importance later down the line. He could be related to Rey he could not be. However in this case I feel that Reys parentage or ancestry isnt as nearly as important as who she will become on her own. ,FanTheories,dgepd8b,4,t5_2u6rc

11684669,0,t3_66fhkf,I always had my own thoughts on this.The Fifth Doctor is arguably the first incarnation in the Doctors lives to face a death where he could legitimately die as opposed to regenerate. Compare Fives death to the Fourths optimism going forward and later on with the Ninth and Eleventh and the Thirds bittersweet passing in their final moments and Fives suddenly seems nihilistic and chillingly final.It is strongly implied that nobody should survive contracting spectrox toxaemia Time Lords included and Five goes in sacrificing his own life for Peri knowing full well that he is most likely not going to regenerate and get another chance. The fact that the Sixth Doctor even exists is a miracle but the effect that the spectrox had would have most likely caused Six to be extremely brain damaged upon his birth and be almost entirely factory reset in terms of behaviour and how he carried himself. He needed to learn all of the lessons that his first four selves in particular learnt all over again but in that one regeneration.The difference was that Peri was not as characteristically strongwilled as Ian and Barbara had been with the First Doctor. She had only just been through a near death experience herself and had no chance to grieve for the man she had only just met and lost within such a short space of time. To Peris credit she did rise to the challenge and became someone who could combat Six and try to make him a better person but it took a lot of time and development. Neither Six nor Peri were suited for their roles in the universe at that specific time.Had things been handled a bit more effectively after The Caves of Androzani the Sixth Doctor would have received a treatment which ultimately made it clear from a narrative perspective that he should have died his mind was much more badly damaged than most of his previous regenerations and ongoing and that his behaviour in The Twin Dilemma was done out of paranoia and massive regression. The show tries to get this across but does not do it very well and most people get the wrong idea.It is also a shame that the show did not get an opportunity address the Fives death more sympathetically during The Twin Dilemma towards the end and as a contrast to what was said very early on. This could have easily been done with the I am the Doctor! Whether you like it or not! statement but by portraying it not out of spite but out of attempting to sympathise with what Peri as the audience surrogate was going through. Maybe Six even still fails at this point but it shows that he wants to be a good man in the same way the Twelfth Doctor later did.I actually quite like The Twin Dilemma and enjoy it more than most but it needed to have much better ties to The Caves of Androzani notice how the spectrox is never mentioned again and become more sympathetic as it progressed. That way it would feel like the second half of a major change and a satisfying end to Season  of Doctor Who at the time with its fairly dark themes as opposed to a battered and hugely flawed whimper.,FanTheories,dgkh3ev,1,t5_2u6rc

Bats needs a plan and he specifically doesnt make one for the robins. Which would make them much more capable of stopping bats.I could see where the other guy is coming from though. It could be argued that he doesnt make a plan for the robins because he doesnt think he needs one and hes usually right about that kind of thing. But perhaps its due to trusting them too much which could easily be his downfall.,FanTheories,dguq91c,18,t5_2u6rc
