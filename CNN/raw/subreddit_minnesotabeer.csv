199820,0,t1_cf11zpv,Yeah it really grinds my gears that people will post reviews from such an event. You have to go knowing that youre not going to get an accurate taste due to the cold but just meet some brewers and have a blast fooling around in the snow. ,minnesotabeer,cf179pr,1,t5_2sisn

2142092,0,t1_cl8tl9g,I started homebrewing when I was . I still remember the first great beer I had Sierra Nevada Pale Ale and that was in many ways a life changing experience. I began digging deeper and deeper into quality beer despite being legally prohibited from doing so. When I went home after my freshman year in college I decided that my big summer hobby would be brewing beer. From there I just kept it going.Fast forward a few years and Niko and I were living together and I was teaching him how to brew. We ran into Matt who we had known through playing rugby against each other and invited him over to brew with us. We quickly developed a friendship over quality craft beer and brewing.  This was about  Id say. We kept home brewing together until  when Niko and I left Minnesota for grad school me in Chicago and him in Texas.Niko quickly learned that the PhD track wasnt for him and got more involved in the professional brewing industry. After brief stints at Jester King and Southern Star he took a job at Live Oak Brewing quickly working his way up to brewer. I can confidently say we would not be making the quality beer we are today without Nikos experience there.,minnesotabeer,clc3w40,3,t5_2sisn

4107015,0,t3_37n9ma,You should be able to get cans like Bent Paddle and Surly along with others.Most anywhere with Surly is likely to have other craft beer and cans. Their beer finder should help.Same deal with Bent Paddle. Spots that carry them should have others too.I agree that shooting over to the WI side in Superior and looking for New Glarus is a good idea but I wouldnt bother with Spotted Cow unless you like pretty plain cream ale. Most any bar around there will have it on tap to try first. Highly recommend the other New Glarus options especially the fruit beers and Thumbprint series.  Bring a couple rolls of paper towels to wrap the bottles in and then put them in big ziplock bags. That way if they do happen to break the paper towels absorb much of it and the bags keep it from getting on everything.Theres a bottle shop inside the Fitgers complex down the hall from Fitgers Brewhouse that should have a decent selection though Im not sure how much it has in the way of singles.Ask the guys at Fitgers Bent Paddle Thirsty Pagan or other spots. Theyll point you towards where you need to go.,minnesotabeer,crofb32,2,t5_2sisn

4213611,0,t1_cs0dr89,Yeah I went there like a month or so ago. I got the super flight which is Nine beers. A new brewery is trying to maintain NINE beers which is nuts none of which was an IPA. They had a DIPA but I didnt really care for it. I thought the staff and prices were good though and the kolsch was drinkable.,minnesotabeer,cs0jby1,1,t5_2sisn
4363291,0,t1_cshgwdz,It wasnt the Firkins that caused that. We didnt see as much a few years back. Thats what caused the quick sell out across town. Since then weve seen an increase in the case allowance to our market. In addition there are more great DIPAs in the market now. Theres less need for people to go out and grab HopSlam the second it hits here when they can get stuff as good or better all year round. Thats why it sits around for a month or two now across town when it use to be a single day event at every store.,minnesotabeer,cshh6xv,1,t5_2sisn
5130188,0,t3_3l9jhr,Here you guys go.  I added some data validation fields so you can flag beers you want to try and you can rate beers too!  All fields are sortable and it is mostly error free.This took me a good couple hours to get it to this state.  I wrote about a dozen formulas in excel to pull all the data out of the PDF program  It isnt perfect some of the descriptions didnt start on their own line instead started right after the beer title but I am done working on this for tonight.I hope at least one of you enjoys this!,minnesotabeer,cv4donv,2,t5_2sisn

10891398,0,t3_5v84o7,i got this email from my senator patricia torres raygtDear NeighborgtgtThank you for taking the time to connect with my office to express your strong support for Sunday liquor sales.gtgtYou and other constituents expressed disappointment with my position on this issue in the past. I have been opposed to this change in legislation since I got elected to the Senate not because I was unwilling to hear your concerns or because Ive been lobbied by special interests. gtgtI have opposed Sunday liquor sales because we have many small family owned liquor stores in our district who oppose this change. They want to have Sundays off to do their administrative work and they argue that being opened an extra day would not increase sales it would only spread sales out over seven days forcing them to absorb the increase in staffing costs eventually putting them out of business. They also fear that this is a move towards allowing larger grocery stores into the market which will definitely put small liquor stores out of business.gtgtIm a strong supporter of small family owned business. Ive often argued that we need to do a better job of representing their voices here at the Capitol that commitment is what has guided my vote. gtgtHaving said all of this after hearing from so many constituents I have decided to support Sunday liquor sales this year. You are the voices that I listen to. Your priorities are the priorities I represent. gtgtThank you for giving me the opportunity to represent you in the Minnesota Senate. Your voices have always guided my work at the legislature. Im thankful for the privilege to represent a community who is constantly engaged in conversations that impact all of us.gtgtPlease feel free to contact me to discuss other concerns. gtgtSincerelygtSenator Patricia Torres Rayway to go senator! and keep voicing your opinions this is proof that they do listen!,minnesotabeer,de3dch6,2,t5_2sisn
