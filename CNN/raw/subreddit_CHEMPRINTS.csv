4796465,0,t3_3g8zzy,The linked news report has some very suspicious elements in it that tend to put the entire report in question. It attempts to create a false perception that  a. aerosol spraying is a safe and viable answer to global warming and  b. large oceangoing ships create lingering aerosol cloud trails in the sky that last for a week!?!.  At around the  minute mark the report shows what appears to be a typical satellite photo of a sky filled with jet plane aerosolsprayed lingering trails commonly referred to as chemtrails which the narrator claims is a picture of cloud trails being left by shipping traffic crossing the ocean. But while the pictured cloud trail patterns do indeed match satellite pics of geoengineered persistent contrail patterns the curved and crossed cloud trails do NOT match normal shipping traffic lane patterns.  And by some strange coincidence the pictures alleged helterskelter ship exhaustgenerated lingering cloud trails appear to be expanding from thin lines into thicker lines just as aerosol sprayed lingering contrails from jet aircraft so often do. The satellite picture is followed by a very brief image flashed onscreen of a large shippingcontainer vessel with a waterhugging fog cloud moving off in a completely horizontal direction  to the FRONT of the ship not trailing behind it! The ship is NOT at sea and is not under fullpower as it is being guided by tugboats. No visible clouds are coming out of its exhaust stack. Presented as an example of a ship producing cloud trails the picture appears to be a complete hoax imbedded to lend authenticity to the story at least for those not paying close attention. The viewer is led to believe this disingenuous picture supposedly shows an example of a ship crossing the ocean while creating a lingering cloud trail in the sky like those just alluded to and shown previously in the satellite photo but that is obviously NOT what this ship picture shows.  Viewers are being purposefully misled by this report into believing that large oceangoing ship engine emissions are causing the formation of long persistent trails aerosol contrails that expand as clouds in the skies over the oceans and last up to a week. As a widelytraveled seafairer that has lived and worked on oceangoing ships I have to call bullshit on this ruse.       This indoctrinating MSM news report looks and feels more like a psyop misdirectcover up for persistent contrails and geoengineering activities than an actual science report. The lame pictures of the shippingcontainer vessel in fog is a dead giveaway that it is a crudely faked report. After viewing this misinformation stinker one might think the PTB could put a little more money and effort into making their MSM propaganda pieces more believable. Or perhaps they just dont care how sloppy their work is since so many people are already programmed to soak up their puppetmasters indoctrination and propaganda without ever questioning it. It seems the Control Matrix of lies and deception has already been established is functioning quite well and is encountering very little resistance.  Please learn to question everything with a rational and reasoning mind and take action!  ,CHEMPRINTS,ctz4t3i,1,t5_37zws
