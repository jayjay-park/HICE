1155604,0,t3_27chef,I saw it today at my countrys premiere. Turnout was poor but it was never going to attract the main demographic of my country anyway so Im glad they even bothered to show it at all. As for the movie I felt that everyones comments about it being extremely faithful to the book are completely justified. I also enjoyed that even though my love of the book is less for the literal love story and more for all the things it represents the movie conveyed the subtleties of all the symbolism in the book very well. However if you didnt go into the movie aware of the hidden symbols I dont think anyone would actually have stumbled upon them by just watching like you may have realized on your own after reading the book. I also felt that some moments had the feel of the scene changed but it could have just been me missing context clues in the actual book. That said the fat that was trimmed felt very natural and while the book benefits from these details the movie didnt lose out from them. Kaitlyn and Carolyn werent really major ploy devices and especially since Hazels narration isnt the constant force it was in the book Carolyns story wouldnt have been conveyed to the audience in a meaningful way. But even more than that the way they handled the text messages was brilliant. Loved it. Also that soundtrack was amazing I need to get a copy it as soon as I can! Shailene and Ansel definitely killed it out there and Nat did a great job as well. I did feel that the acting of the supporting cast wasnt mind blowing but it didnt really make a difference. Speaking of Nat though the only scene from the books that I felt the movie left out but should have kept was Issac soon after his surgery. The movie seemed to just accept his blindness rather than give him the space as a character to come into such a major change. And that brings me to my one final complaint and thats that Gus letter wasnt a direct copy of the one from the book  Im pretty sure they changed it up a bit and while its great I still think the original version which ends with Hazel saying I do. is more appropriate and has a lot more meaning than Okay. but youd only really realize this if you begin to linguistically examine the book which isnt necessarily a good thing. Either way the letter was still the best part of it all. I suppose in closing I felt that all my complaints if you can call them that are pretty shallow. The movie is damn near perfect and as a huge fan of the book I dont think that it could have been any better than it turned out to be. ,thefaultinourstars,chzme2k,6,t5_2wvta
