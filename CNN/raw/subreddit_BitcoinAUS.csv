Also agenda free ie not promoting something is harder.It is even difficult together and authoritative list of Oz sites selling for bitcoin. Everything is out of date last time I checked.,BitcoinAUS,co18n71,1,t5_2wq43
11406625,0,t3_61xaxw,If we do go cashless this will increase demand for bitcoin.I think privacy with bitcoin is manageable  yes they can see that you own bitcoin but once you tumble it they cant trace it.It looks like the banks are scared and they are utilising cryptos tech but another plus in this for crypto is that we will have the option to either use an authoritive or decentralised cashless model. Surely the developer of such technology would vote for the decentralised one unless they are getting paid bulk and are willing to join the dark side.i love the sharing and gifting economies  authority cant fuck with it.,BitcoinAUS,dfoxdln,1,t5_2wq43
