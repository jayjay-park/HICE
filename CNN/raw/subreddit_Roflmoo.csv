524905,0,t1_cfzx6o2,gtI just dont want it to overlap with combat speed or anything else.Theres no reason it should whatever it ends up being. Few speedsters have a high degree of technical skill and vice versa. Batman M and Flash would be sky high on one and pretty low on the other.gtMaybe winloss ratio? That could also be bad so many fights are won for reasons other than fighting ability.Im not sure how workable it is. Ill think about it and give you better feedback on this later.gtLifting and hitting would be tough too and would probably be identical for most fighters.Sure but so is combat and travel speeds. Its rare to have one without the other but when it can make a huge difference if one is lacking.,Roflmoo,cfzxrfj,2,t5_2yenv
