415555,0,t3_1r0gik,My suggestion for James amp Mike Mondays  try TimeSplitters  or  called Future Perfect. The series has one of the best multiplayer ever made  its crazy fun fast full of action and really good  The series was made by Free Radical Design which were the people from Rare yep GoldenEye and Perfect Dark. Read about the series watch some videos etc. The episode could look like James Bond  Nightfire but its all down to you. As an oldtimer gamer I really recommend it to everyone and especially to fellow pro gamers like you guys  All best loads of positive stuff and God bless  Luke from Poland. Cheers! p.s.

846879,0,t3_1r0gik,I usually dont make any kinds of requests for videos seeing as Im pretty entertained by most JampM Mondays whatever they are but theres one game pretty close to my heart that I would love to see. The Haunting  Starring Polterguy on Sega Genesis. Being sort of a horror cartoon and comedy fan I always thought it was one of the most underrated games that I played though. Its quite literally a game of Beetlejuice where you scare the piss out of a rich snobby family and yes they do piss their pants from time to time. In each house the family moves to theres a ridiculous amount of things to possess and frighten them with. Everything from chairs to lamps and doorways become a playground of horror to freak them out. Nods to Friday the th and a lot of other horror movies are in there as well. And in the last level..... a dog takes a shit on a bed.One of my personal fave games on the Genesis. ,TheCinemassacre,ch0jlvj,2,t5_2z4sy

I loved the comparison of the game and the star Betelgeuse its such a ridiculous concept but the nerd has so much conviction in his voice I was laughing out loud during the whole thing.I like the nerd in this somewhat more subdued state personally its more believable as a character and feels more natural coming from James at this point. Obviously there are parts of the video when he does get really angry but nothing on the level of the rant at the end of the Bill amp Ted episode for example. I like that episode a lot too but the writing and performance in this episode just felt especially on point in my opinion.,TheCinemassacre,cla5cni,11,t5_2z4sy

I just printed out another camera mount for my Ultimaker the other day so that I can have a permanently fixed camera on it.

7246491,0,t1_d21cscl,Yeah he did reuse old footage so I get why he did it.  I think he took it one step further though.  For exampleWhen the episode starts off the Aspect Ratio is modern.  What we see today on all his videos.Seen HereWhen he goes back in time for the first time we see the aspect ratio change.Seen HereWhen he returns to the present we see the aspect ratio return to what it was before he went back in time.Seen HereIt would have been something really easy to ignore.  He could have done the entire episode not referencing it.  That said he did reference it and the episode is better for it.  At least I think so. ,TheCinemassacre,d21vhng,2,t5_2z4sy

Its like they just saw the title of Jamess video and immediately jumped to the conclusion that he must be the worst ever person to walk the earth. It seems everyone is in blind defense mode these days always ready to lash out full force at the first sign of criticism no matter if justified or not.And for the record I dont agree with you that someone that has a voice should always stay positive towards everything.

I can think of easily a top  from the s to today.

11020860,0,t1_deh38dn,i feel like theyve james and mike have made some fundamental changes to the site their vision and how they want to go forward.  i have to assume that james is in a position particularly financially that he doesnt have to be so AVGN focused and for his creative juices thats great.  however with . million YT subscribers they still need content and thats where mike comes in and thats why we are seeing all these playthroughs and cinemassacre defeated things you notice how they changed the name of their second YT channel to cinemassacre plays instead of extras?.  i heard mike mention in a recent stream breath of the wild or SMB that he was wanting to get more into modern gaming and thats where ryan comes in etc.  Im wondering if they feel focusing on retro gaming isnt a good idea anymore andor there are so many other nostalgic channels are out there that they should expand into current games too.  Im still baffled by the cancellation of Mike and Bootsy Bootsy beats and Bootsy just in general apparently never appearing on the site anymore but those choices would coincide with being more modern.ampnbspultimately im speculating but something definitely seems afoot to me and speaking truthfully i do not find myself being quite as entertained as i used to.  maybe im just growing up too.,TheCinemassacre,deh6mz9,5,t5_2z4sy
