44300,0,t1_ceinkff,It seems as thought you are looking into the future a good ways and some others are looking into the here and now. You are looking so far into the future you are talking about factions being created possibly but not necessarily by violence. The governing bodies will evolve when the population of a few hundred grows to several thousand to a million to several million. Currently there will be less than a thousand people going to Mars. For the launch date and the immediate governing I think I agree with some of the others here that it would be very dependent upon Earth and Earth actually calling the shots. Some level of leadership type of roles possibly military style would exist on the colony itself. I think there would come a time that the Mars colony could be self sufficient especially with the advancement of D printing and then using local materials from Mars. Once self sufficient there are so many different types of governing that could work. I have often thought about if I could start my own colony and government what would I do different.

3304874,0,t3_2xwkfx,A good question. I think this requires some experiential basis. I recommend learning another language if you want to be able to understand the answer with depth.The bilingualists of us can express the same thought in multiple languages without needing to translate between the two.The brain does something similar to a computer language compiler which takes some communication and transforms it to binary a string of s amp s that the computer hardware will be able to process according to a set of rules defining that computer language. Understand that is if we can define Understanding as the reception and processing of information.You compile a thought into english according to the syntax of the english language when you speak. This is a subconscious process for you. Bilingual persons compile thoughts into a language of their choice. The expression of their thought in that language will take on the limitations of that language. How precise you can express that thought depends on the lexicon concepts nuances available to the compiler your brain. Thoughts themselves occur at a subconscious level spoken language itself perhaps due to being trained to require your conscious attention on listening when output by your braincompiler grabs  of your attention. The remaining  of your mind the real depth of your mind where the thoughts are pure amp undistorted by the process of compilation into language is drowned out by this roar of your overt consciousness which is entrained by the stream of language your are outputting from your compiler brain. You are consciously unaware of your basal originating pure thoughts therefore you tend to make the mistake of thinking that language is what enables thought. This is a natural thing since all of your thoughts have been expressed in language of tounge.Without language the human would still think amp be capable of direct thought abstraction understanding relationships between concepts etc. However the mode of consciousness that a nonlanguage using human would experience life in would be different. Without the  entrainment in some stream of language the subjects conscious mind would integrate to much deeper levels of subconsciousness and they would be much more aware of their more powerful purer thoughts. The light of awareness conscious awareness would ascend to a higher location and the shadows subconsciousness which this light cast would have a reduced reach. This would provide some significant advantages to the subject.As some more practical means for you to find an answer to your question. You can try meditation specifically the act of observing your thoughts.Great insightful question.Edit therefore language imoae is merely a dressing for your thoughts.,InsightfulQuestions,cp4zd5f,2,t5_2smsq

If he wants to constantly try and convert religious people or tell them how dumb they are for believing in God Id see that as a problem. Same as if he was religious and trying to do the same to atheists.As for wanting him to become religious I think it really depends on why he became atheist. I was never that religious but a quote by Epicurus really knocked things into place for me. Is God willing to prevent evil but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?So even if tomorrow I was shown irrefutable proof he existed I wouldnt become religious.

7745088,0,t3_4ldr4w,It depends on the city.I was  when the  Olympics came to Los Angeles.  I grew up in a LA suburb south of LAX.The biggest improvement was to LAX.  They turned it into a two storey terminal with departures on top and arrivals below.  This was huge.  LAX was a pure nightmare as a singlelevel airport.  It could take an hour or two to drop off or pick someone up.  It still gets swamped but its far better.They reused quite a few venues from the  Olympics which was great.  They were fixed up and most of them are still used today.IIRC LA came out in the black for the  Olympics.  A lot of that came from using existing venues.  Also theres plenty of infrastructure and hotels in LA so it worked out well.I would love to see the Olympics come back to LA.  It was so exciting to go to the games and LA is in even better shape today.  The Metro didnt exist in  but it is pretty good today.  LAX can still handle an Olympic crowd.  Plus many of the venues used in  and  are still there  it would not take much to get them ready again.Personally I think the Olympics should rotate among five or six cities that already have the imfrastructure in place.  Most of the expense comes from having to build new structures each time then those building usually fall into disuse.  LA would make a great perpetual host because almost everything is already there.,InsightfulQuestions,d3mk6cj,13,t5_2smsq

7825744,0,t3_4mhb3h,Here is what I wrote yesterday in response to Elon Musks claim that he thinks chances are either extremely high that we live inside a computer simulation done by an extremely advanced species  seeing that this is actually currently our trajectory of technological advancement where we learn to simulate worlds like computer games so detailed that they are indistinguishable from nature if me manage not to fuck it up  OR the Fermi Paradox holds and chances are even higher that we will in fact fuck up our attempt at an advanced civilisation one way or anothergt I think the most important part in this was the conclusion. Either our lives are a simulation or civilisation will end inevitably. And personally I think all the evidence points towards the latter option.gt gt Not that Im trying to spread pessimism among you fine people but we all know we are at a very very crucial moment in our history right now. And it is bigger than nukes the economy or climate change. Its the collapse of our culture. Civilisation as we know it. And there is a reason.gt gt Humans have lived sustainably in nature for hundreds of thousands of years before some of us decided to try and take more than we needed planting storing eating growing and exterminating competition. That final part in particular is what worked very well for those peoples some . years ago growing in numbers claiming ever more for themselves to sustain their population while always continuing to grow. gt gt Totalitarian agriculture probably describes it best. We have become cultured and civilised on the false knowledge which sustains itself until today that we are so magnificent that the only way to explain our cleverness is thatgt gt gt this world was made for us and we were made to rule it.gt gt Whatever Gods you wanna make the father of your story we have all come to believe this simple fact. And we are riding on the wings of this false premise and indeed we have come far. But it takes a lot of willpower to convince myself this flight will keep on going into realms in which games indistinguishable from reality will have become a thing. Or any of the other things we like to dream about. A sane and benevolent government a trusting community fair treatment of all life on this planet and beyond etc.gt gt This world was not made for us and we were never meant to conquer it especially not in the kind of totalitarian way that feels all too natural to our culture. We have every right to be here and to fight to remain on this planet but we have to do so without hubris in partnership with the rest of the natural world. gt gt gt Take what you need but leave enough for everyone else.gt gt Might be a good start for a new way to think of ourselves but who knows if well get that far.gt gt My point is. The Fermi Paradox still holds. It is still exceedingly unlikely that an intelligent species develops a culture and technology space travel and say immortality and grandscale simulations without eliminating their resources first dying out through diseases blowing themselves up in delusional wars like ours with nuclear warheads the list of ways in which any advanced species might take itself out of the genepool is endless. gt gt And most of the terrible options seem avoidable in hindsight. If we actually looked at what works well in the long term in nature and grounded our cultures on that the changes would be profound but could be accomplished if everyone began to understand that this planet is not ours to be conquered. That instead we have a chance to become its stewards. Wardens of lifes diversity.gt gt Who knows. I still think that there will be a way to go to space and to the movies and all that sustainably once we stop waging war against nature and instead try to work with it and for it. But that is one hell of a prerequisite for any advanced culture to meet Id imagine. It would take a lot for you to convince me that were the special advanced culture in the galaxy and beyond that suddenly wakes up before the iceberg hits and collectively steers clear into a long and bright future full of virtual this and virtual that. As much as I love all that and Elon for that matter I think were getting full steam ahead of ourselves in a time where we should really really be reflecting on which way we are going to leap.Take what you will from this. But more specifically to your question It seems clear to me what our culture is building towards its literally written on the walls. Consumption is the foundation of our society always a little more than we need always a little cheaper. And here it is driving us headlong into a wall and we are happy to pay for it too. If you think you can convince me that we can sustain our current rate of consumption expansion and waste production safely long into the future Im happy to hear anyones argument Im still trying to find one myself. For now it seems inevitable that we will burn through most of our primary resources beginning from this century be it wood oil fish reserves and very likely our harvests will fail more often due to soil depletion and the sudden unpredictable effects of climate change. But its not all bad now we can clearly see if we dare to look what doesnt work in life namely being antilife being antidiversity pro control of life and death. And we see through antropology this delusion isnt inherent to humans at all despite us liking to think that. The Gebusi people of Papua New Guinea had no idea of our way of life until a few decades ago. If you had tried to explain to them what RoundUp is for or that the vast majority of us are sitting at desks doing menial work we hate to get money we dont have to buy things we dont need youd likely get a look of horror. And there were thousands of such cultures before ours manifested now there is all but a handful left we havent absorbed.Now after seeing the edge of the waterfall only meters ahead we need to rethink your question and find a new answer quickly. Id suggest to ask the quickest minds on this makeshift raft of ours to think hard and fast how we can rebuild it now so we may have a chance to avoid the waterfall all together and glide down on the wings of problem solving. Only after we have overcome that challenge can we really consider your question of what we want to build towards in the very long run.,InsightfulQuestions,d3vohs8,7,t5_2smsq

We can do it the plans are out there and it produces good water.The biggest problem with desalinization is that it is energy intensive.  Fortunately solar energy keeps getting cheaper and cheaper and cheaper.There will be massive solarpowered desalinization plants.  Lots of them.  Further they are not politically controversial.  Everyone needs water and no one will argue about supplying water.  Solar power is almost noncontroversial too.The cost will raise some minor issues.  Thing is everyone needs water.  So you float some government bonds to pay for it and you tax and charge fees to those who consume the water.  The government can stretch this over a few decades so it will only be marginally more expensive to consumers.So when we really need it solarpowered desalinization is going to happen.

For instance I cant see how the Darwin awards could possible be a productive social tool.Secondly implicit is this idea that society would be better off without stupid people.

Sex in general was simply never brought up as I was raised and when it is even mentioned I still get uncomfortable.

I realize thats not technically true however the feelings of discomfort I feel when Im around openly gay people are the same as I would feel if somebody was talking about their favorite sex position dildo etc.I understand homosexuality is unique in that you cant exactly keep it to yourself without completely hiding the identity of your significant other. However when I see gay pride parades or stereotypical flaming personalities portrayed in media it comes off as excessively flaunting ones sex life. I dont feel personally threatened but I do feel awkward and uncomfortable. I normally wouldnt even make a reply to a thread like this but it bothered me that most of the replies were along the lines of Im not homophobic but... which irked me for some reason.

11806276,0,t1_dgy676f,The thing is science produces results. The phone in your pocket has amazingly accurate global positioning capabilities that are dependent on satellites that orbit a spheroid earth and transmit radio signals following the scientifically validated laws of gravity electromagnetism and relativity. Even if you dont understand the science yourself you have this evidence that it does actually work which is so much more certain than the afterthefact causeandeffect explanations that humans are prone to falling for that enable religion and pseudoscience to continue. I do find the flat earth claims interesting. Theres enough logic in them to make them sound convincing but its whackamole logicit doesnt add up to a complete selfconsistent systematic explanation that makes sense. Nobody is providing wonders like GPS service using a flatearth model. All science is interconnected in one enormous system. The spherical earth electromagnetism evolution medicine are all part of one noncontradictory if not yet complete system of knowledge. Flatearthism telepathy creationism and homeopathy do not support each other in any way.Yes people take science for granted but our relationship to science is very different from the prescientific belief in religion. We live in a world brimming with technology that is based on human understanding of how the world actually works which was discovered using the scientific method. Religion claimed to explain the world and it created culture but its explanations never led to any tangible technology. ,InsightfulQuestions,dgya60g,11,t5_2smsq
