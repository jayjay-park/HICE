148844,0,t1_cetkkek,I ran around that site last evening and Im not sure whether to shout from the rooftops or kick you in the shins. Honestly though it does give me a place where at least for rocket ships and a few other sf bits I can draw a confident line between science and good solid Handwavium.Have to admit it is kind of fun to see citations of other authors that used Unobtanium and Handwavium in classic and wellwritten books.That said I will still work to keep as close to the science in my SF that I can but I wont feel so guilty when I have to resort to Handwavium.Thanks much Gustavdman.,SciFiConcepts,cevdu81,1,t5_2s71u
209165,0,t3_1whyyr,This sub isnt really intended for posts that are mostly just a question. This sub is intended for posts that contain a noteworthy concepts that have been decently formed as a starting point for further discussion. For straight up questions consider rAskScienceFiction. The concept of societies living on the habitable moon of a large planet has been done quite often I believe generally the primary planet is a large gaseous planet like Jupiter. More than one is described in A Deepness in the Sky. The planet in Avatar is a moon I believe. Also a place for note taking would be the Space Odyssey series and Larry Nivens A Hole in Space. These are just what I personally can think of off the top of my head. Google science fiction habitable moons returns several promising links.,SciFiConcepts,cf29n16,2,t5_2s71u

1182879,0,t1_ci2oaxl,Thanks so much for your replys... Its getting my brain going on this.Havent thought to much on the size. Was thinking like you said statium size or even two. Thinking if it piped out of the blue it would be suspended still and fall slowly to the ground. Just something emerging from the sky or clouds like that and just crushing to the ground is fascinating to me.The story would be like I said this father and boy driving down a highway witness this event and the shockwave from this crashes them and they wake up...,SciFiConcepts,ci2oywm,1,t5_2s71u
1629506,0,t3_2cyzex,I really doubt  of the population is in carsplanes at any moment or standing close enough to roads to be casualtiesThe average commute in the USA is  mins so lets round that up to  mins and thats  hour a day or th of the day.It would take many planes more than  min to crash to the earth even if they werent on autopilot.  And plenty of cars would be stopped at stoplights or going slow enough that a blackout wouldnt be fatal.Lets face it while there would be many dramatic and tragic accidents the vast majority of people spend the vast majority of their time sitting somewhere a blackout couldnt do worse than a bruise.,SciFiConcepts,cjkkbgz,4,t5_2s71u
1685336,0,t1_cjrcjjy,Definitely the characters. I have been thinking now to set it after a war  after massive annihilation of our species because of each other because we never change  and I want to focus on four individuals that represent their empires and whether they can and will and want to be there when the next superpower rises. But the setting though fantastic is secondary to the characters. Always. Thank you for the question. Does the premise sound a good one for you?,SciFiConcepts,cjrlmv2,1,t5_2s71u

8622298,0,t1_d6im45f,I mentioned Alcubierre drives already.Mostly the problem of propulsion is ignored almost entirely in space opera simply described as or assumed to be some form of rocket mechanism with some fuel an exothermic reaction and an exhaust nozzle. If one were to write a hard space opera then no energy source will make a rocket work so the only alternative is currently unknown physics such as the theorized Alcubierre drive or something similar.,SciFiConcepts,d6je051,1,t5_2s71u
