Had nearly identical symptoms last week bled the brakes and replaced with new fluid two days ago running fine now! gtIs there a spring that helps release the pressure that could be worn or missing?Close in fact but not quite there.  There is air andor suspended particulate matter in the brake fluid which functionally acts as a spring suspended in the fluid causing your brakes to engage even when the brake lever is not being engaged.Do you have ABS on that model year?,klr650,cgmsxaq,2,t5_2skgw

1488071,0,t3_2b7hhb,Im  with about a  or  inseam. I would say it is very doable to ride and control. I can do tiptoe if I do both feet which is enough to back out the bike on even a slight incline. For just stopping I simply just put one foot down. I would say for off roading it is a big pig and makes for not the best off roading bike. You have to force it to do harder trails and it will not be graceful in the slightest. If you want to do harder trails with it I would say go for a smaller  or  for that. However with that said the KLR can do anything that you want and since it is cheaper you can drop it and be okay with it. Its a perfect do anything and everything bike while on a budget.,klr650,cj2szau,2,t5_2skgw

1757499,0,t3_2elbpw,This sort of post doesnt bother me an iota. Reddit like life is what you make it! What else is it for if not unrestricted unencumbered disinhibited flow of information?Maybe the rider who is going to sell you your future KLR is on here reading this right now or soon to anyways. seems like a pretty low budget but maybe Dallas is better in that regard. Paid  for a  with  on it in December and thats low for the dual sports around here. Good service and track record nice outfits low mileage dual sports are all over in Seattle and everyone wants at least k cause they are mostly beemers. So the KLR was a nice find after my GS.What does irk me though is heinous spelling in submission titles. Where the do you guys but KLRs.

3116260,0,t3_2vdvfz,Heres my two cents from experience.Happy trails engine guards are decent. Their highway peg setup is awesome I ran that shit to Alaska and back solo  they are excellent.So one day I decided to wheelie my KLR off a little hill in a field. All went well until I realized I was headed for a barbwire fence at mph. I grabbed front brake and started to wrestle her over for the turn. Too much brake. Front end locks and she goes down hard. Happy Trails engine guards arent designed for that impact it took out my fairing and teaked everything. They bent over like tin.If you plan on running that thing hard spend the money on the SW Motech crash bars. They rape you on the highway peg setup but those bars are incredible. I have no problems just dumping my bike on a bank for a kickstand up in the sticks now. They would have saved me from spraining my ankle in my crash too.Im running the Happy Trails luggage rack with Givi monokey cases and love it. The rack is a little blocky looking but it is well made and even withstood a pretty nasty slipover on the Dirty Face ride a couple years back. Plus the folks at Happy Trails are fantastic passionate and patriotic about dual sporting. Its Idaho Idaho people just fucking rock.Good luck!!!Happy ,klr650,col0074,2,t5_2skgw
3445772,0,t1_cpkzq1a,From what I can tell lots of people didnt know haha.  Getting the adjustment right is tricky too.  Basically if you feel like you are on a pogo stick increase the dampening.  There are lots of opinions on the subject on where to set it for road vs offroad.  Some people will just say the shock sucks no matter what so just set the preload and dampening both to .   I currently have preload on  roughly  lbs between me gear and top box and my dampening on  I think.  edit This is was the best explantion Ive found of what to think about when setting the dampening.Yes dampening controls how fast the shock returns to its original length. In truth the fluid inside the shock and the orifices it goes through dampens the action if the spring. Without that the spring would just boing up and down until its own internal friction stopped it. The dampening adjust ment controls how fast it is allowed to return to length. Now imagine if you set the dampening to be very slow or perhaps stiff is a way to describe it. If you were to ride the bike over a washboard surface the shock would compress when you hit a bump. With the dampening set to stiff or slow the shock could not extend after you had passed the bump so it is compressed when you hit the next bump. The shock would compress a bit more. Rinse lather repeat until the spring rate wont let the shock compress further. In other words it has stopped working. Thats a packed up shock. The sensation would be as you ride over the first few bumps that the rear of the bike has sat down. Sort of like a dog that has a poo stuck to its butt and its dragging its ass across the carpet to wipe it off. ,klr650,cpl1l4f,1,t5_2skgw

9467581,0,t1_d9g19bx,gt say you have get a magnet rotor fabricated to match the Amp stator you would then have  amps?Yes. After all the magnet part of the rotor doesnt know what type of engine its being driven by. But it would be a lot of work to make such a custom rotor assuming you could make one that would fit and still work the same way as the OEM rotor. Its far less work to harvest the low hanging fruit in the existing lighting system by replacing all the incandescent bulbs with LED.What is driving your requirement to have a A stock is A alternator? AFAIK from my own experience my Gen  A alternator is able to run my Gerbing heated jacket liner and heated gloves once I replaced my headlight with an LED unit.,klr650,d9g2zi7,1,t5_2skgw

10561728,0,t3_5r49m5,Im  and can comfortably flat foot both feet. I wish I would have gotten a KLR for my first bike instead of my heavy cruiser. For reference I got my near mint condition  KLR with  miles for  including hitch trailer tank bag USB charger trickle charger. Found on Craigslist. The dude had receipts for all of the maintenance and checkups done at a very well known shop. He even stored it at the shop in the winter! He also insisted on us both filling out a proof of sales thing that he made me a copy of.  I was confident nothing fishy was going on which put my mind at ease being that I am in the early stages of becoming a motorcycle guy. ,klr650,dd5ahq4,1,t5_2skgw

10839676,0,t3_5uwnrv,You dont want it any lower. Trust me. I just bought a klr with lowering links. That stuff came off instantly XD. If its too tall panniers cargo basket are your friend. Theyll sink the rear a little. You can change the rear shock preload too. That might help. My dads  feels taller than my gen  with  miles but my old suspension has probably sank a little. ,klr650,ddy1apy,1,t5_2skgw
10871015,0,t1_de06h0r,All that means is that the Kawasaki dealers youve visited dont do much KLR business. And most likely dont have any employees who ride KLRs. But yeah its a fairly simple thing to do for a lot of peace of mind. ,klr650,de19nce,2,t5_2skgw
