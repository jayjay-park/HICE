4137261,0,t3_3801o2,I was never really a big Gardy fan.  When he inherited a good team from Tom Kelly he didnt do anything notable with it. He was  in the playoffs and lost his last eight playoff games at the Metrodome IIRC.Yes he was hampered by Bill Smith but the list of his wrecked young players is at least as long as the list of good ones he developed.  And if you were young there was always plenty of room for you under Gardenhires bus.Sure veteran players loved playing for him.  In the Twins organization it took four straight lastplace finishes to get some semblance of accountability.  Who wouldnt love playing for a guy who stood in the gap like Gardenhire did?That said whats done is done.  It was clearly time for change here on more than one front.  Neil Allen has been a revelation as well.  But if Gardenhire winds up in Chicago good luck to him.  Molitors approach seems to be working and even if it doesnt work out this year the Twins are watchable again and thats wonderful.,minnesotatwins,crrv7d0,3,t5_2s4mv

4634982,0,t1_cteq6f4,Giving a team a discount when you sign a contract like Duncan did is different than taking a pay cut on an alreadysigned contract. MLB contracts are guaranteed as are NBA contacts I believe. NFL contracts are not. The Twins and Mauer could restructure to defer money to later years like after he retires but Joe will get his M per year remaining no matter what. That being said Joe Mauers contract isnt preventing the Twins from signing anyone. If the Twins really want to sign a guy for M through  they can do it with or without Mauer on the books.And besides all that why the hell should Joe Mauer be expected to take a pay cut anyway? The guy played for way less than he was worth when he first came into the league earned himself a huge contract and cashed in. Thats business in professional sports. Get out of here with all that needing to be willing to restructure for the fans crap. He doesnt owe the fans jack.

I would add that Brandon Maurer fits the power pitching profile. However Benoit and Kelley could both hit free agency after this season. Kelley is unsigned beyond this season and Benoit has a MM club option K buyout. Maurer comes with four more seasons of club control. As such hes probably more difficult to acquire.gt The Dodgers Cardinals Twins and Blue Jays are still in the mix for former Marlins closer Steve Cishek reports MLB.coms Joe Frisaro. Cisheks been throwing well since returning from a brief stint at TripleA allowing just one earned run with an to KBB ratio in   innings. Frisaro also adds the Orioles to the list of teams with interest in righthander Dan Haren adding to recent reports that have linked the Blue Jays and Dodgers to Haren.gt The Diamondbacks are receiving lots of calls on righthander Brad Ziegler reports ESPNs Jerry Crasnick via Twitter.

Although I suppose it would be easier to fill in a possible hole at DH should Park fizzle out than it was at SS when Nishioka did.

You would need to send him down for the  days to make up for the original gap and then another  or so days because a service year is about  days shorter than the full season length. If they are going to do it this would be the year to try but if they stay completely out of contention which is likely it would be obvious that it is just service time manipulation and the union would justifiably throw a fit.,minnesotatwins,d2u0u8t,1,t5_2s4mv

9865756,0,t1_datinto,Oh I wasnt really trying to say its a clogged up position at all. That was more the guy I replied to. Mauer Park and Vargas are the reason I just said for at least a few seasons but if they all drop off completely you could accelerate that timeline and just move Bellinger there right away. Its also very possible that Sano ends up at B longterm but theyll at least give him a year or two to try to show he can stick at B. Basically B is just the easiest position to fill defensively because you can move almost anyone there. You just would prefer to play a guy at another position first as long as he is able to. Its also generally pretty easy to find a veteran FA who can play B and hit like this year you havehad EE Napoli Holliday Carter Lind Moss etc. if you really want to keep Sano at B and Bellinger in the OF. ,minnesotatwins,datj484,1,t5_2s4mv
