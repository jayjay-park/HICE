7689472,0,t3_4kneo0,You targeted gamers.Gamers.No but for real though. They claim le SJW menace is super easily offended when a woman having sex who happens to be a writer spawned an enormous harassment effort.I wonder what the overlap between rthedonald and KiA is  Im sure they wouldnt be too happy about this ,HateSubredditOfTheDay,d3g8sda,76,t5_3ecbi

7698569,0,t3_4knepe,Thank you for this I never looked into what the GG movement was although I heard about it before. I just thought it was gamers who didnt want to be targeted by feminists for some reason or another. I did not realize any of this before. ,HateSubredditOfTheDay,d3h9zgv,3,t5_3ecbi
7700411,0,t1_d3gq4c0,See this kind of thing is what does annoy me when it comes to debating anything on the internet. People always pick the most extreme views and then use it as a stick to beat others with. You arent using that persons own statement to invalidate them but rather someone elses opinionactions. To clarify Im not actually directing this solely at you it is something that is too easily done especially on message boards but it kind of dilutes actual debate.,HateSubredditOfTheDay,d3hhi0t,5,t5_3ecbi

8299423,0,t3_4t5af1,These people dont seem to understand the difference between gender gender expression and biological sex conflating all three into a weird amalgam of armchair psychology claiming gender to be a social construct and that biological sex is all the seems to matter in terms of someones gender. With that they accuse trans women of being mentally ill or simply being men trying to infiltrate women only spaces. They feel that trans people are trespassing on what little seems to make them women and they feel threatened by that and by peoples acceptance of trans people lashing out as we all saw in the OP. Its really hard to watch supposed feminists take such hateful stances and bash on people they should be supporting. EditCase in point I just received this message from one of their regularsgtNo I am talking about gender but do understand why you might think I am confused.ExpressionRoleStereotype are terms that people attach to the word gender that is used to try and explain the bad parts of gender away without explaining what gender is.You had a perfect chance here to explain to me what gender was but you didnt. Its because it is the same thing. Gender is .... what people think are nonbiological male traits and nonbiological female traits. Aka men are good at maths females are good at cooking etc. They are sex roles renamed for a new era.Gender expression is how you might express these sex roles. Gender roles are sex roles and that the people using the term dont understand that gender is the problem. If gender or these beliefs didnt exist then sex roles wouldnt exist and no one would be forced into boxes.Which is the main reason why Gender Critical people have issues with trans ideology. Why create more boxes if we can remove the boxes? The idea that you can feel like a womanman aside from biological disconnect means that there is some sort of innate womanman feeling aka its the sexist beliefs from the s again.,HateSubredditOfTheDay,d5ezi2c,20,t5_3ecbi
