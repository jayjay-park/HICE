The second time I did another jetty in the water but it was a lake with trees in the background. Ill have to look at techniques and learn other scenery.Thanks for that. Its really hard because you have to get the paint and water mix right and then its how you paint and do you paint over this what happens if I paint this too dark ect ect.

204563,0,t1_cf1c8va,Todays short rant I admit that today Im emotionally unstable Im just so angry and pissed off! I cant really live with my parents anymore specifically Asian parents they drive me nuts now I avoid to see and talk to them I cant have a conversation with them its only yelling. It makes me hate women even more particularly Asian women they are so fucking possessive and manipulative. It now reaches the point that Im going to abandon my culture and tradition they are so narrow! I told my mum nutrition is important I cant just have rice fried rice fried noodles and noodle soup everyday I need lots of greens and some meats! And now I just received that World Vision has just rejected my job application which is great. However I dont know what else I can do in Malaysia no job and nothing I dont know oversea university will even accept my graduate application and what so ever. Sorry Im just angry!In response to your say In Malaysia  service charge is always included in the bill so we just dont tip.I dont know if I would ever get the job I need some money now and I need to move out from my parents. First of all the salary is low but I see this job as an advantage on my resume if Ive ever applied something else but they just need three researchers and there are seven candidates including me some of them have at least a Master degree and some of them have more working experience. Im just a newbie and Im not smart Im naive to be honest.

215222,0,t3_1wjbsh,Are you wanting guy friends girl friends both?Making friends can be tough tho seems like you are very outgoing and likeable person. Shouldnt be hard for you to make friends you just have to put them in the friends category stay in touch with them and make plans with them to just hang out.As for a couple thoughts...and this is not in any way trying to attack you....just an observation...seems like your family life was troublesome and affected you in ways you yet do not understand. You may feel consciously or unconsciously that getting to close to a woman will only put you back there where you used to be with your family...or you may end up like your father. So you keep women at a distance and when they get too close you have to set them free and start over.Seems like a commitment phobia which can take some time to overcome.I could be way off base...if so i apologize.,lonely,cf2yiaj,1,t5_2qjny

1363018,0,t3_295gxm,I think some of us live with the opposite of joie de vivre mal de vivre. We are down by nature. We dont feel an overwhelming passion for anything. We can love something or someone but not love them. We are calculated more than we are intuitive. I think it doesnt have to be a problem to live with this but society doesnt really allow that. Everyone should be happy. But thats something impossible. People can be content and we are. But happiness is something that comes from within and for some people that switch is just turned to off. Some of us know this about ourselves like me and some dont. Its a matter of acceptance. Not from society but from yourself. If you dont find yourself in this then I would advice seeking professional help. It might be a depression thats brewing or already active within your soul and mind.,lonely,cin56oq,2,t5_2qjny

2067463,0,t3_2iir0o,Im in my mid s so this may not be as relevant but I think its similar to what youre dealing with.Moved away after college to a professional school left most of the people I know there.Met a couple guys I knew very casually from back home. Tried to kind of integrate into their social network and it is just pure hell.I dont get any of their inside jokes. I dont really bond with them. I always feel like a tertiary component of the group as if Im just tagging along. I just dont really seem to be of any relevance or importance. I have stuff in common with these guys but I feel like an outsider and I feel like Im always an afterthought. Ive actually started avoiding them more now because being alone is honestly less hurtful to my psyche than being around people who just kind of passively acknowledge me and dont seem to want to interact. I dont expect them to think Im the greatest thing ever but I see patterns where none of them are ever interested in doing anything with me unless the others are. idk maybe this isnt what youre saying but I feel like this is kind of my scenario.FWIW Ive never had any really close friends. It doesnt seem like thats just going to develop as I get older and it really fucking sucks. I could really use a close friend but people just kind of avoid me. Ive tried changing how I act and being as nice and positive as I can and its just well. I just fall short. They all have better more exciting alternatives than me. It really just gnaws a hole in your heart. I feel for you. Im sorry you had a divorce and Im sorry youre lonely. I know exactly what youre going through. I wish I could find a solution for you but I cant I dont know how to change myself but I wouldnt give up.

3016458,0,t3_2upmih,This might be something that youre already aware of but I think that youre introverted which explains your tendency to feel burnt out after social interaction.As someone thats introverted and usually craves solitude and sometimes not gets frustrating it can be difficult to find people with the same... mindset. Since theyre mostly the quiet ones picking them out of the crowd can be a bit of a chore . You usually wont find them in social settings either.Being happy is a process and progression towards your goal will be anything but linear. Setting small realistic goals to attain happiness seems to be a method that a lot of people support. You dont need any extreme motivation to get these little goals done going for a light walk cleaning your room etc. and they will all contribute to making you feel at least a little better.And Ill stress this again progression will not be linear. Youll have plenty of ups and downs to deal with on your personal journey. I cant guarantee you that happiness is waiting at the end but you can certainly increase your chances of getting there.That last point you made about having homework to do but wanting to sleep...

In your attempt to accept loneliness youve vilified friendship. If what you say about friendship is true you should feel relief now that this friendship has died but instead you feel lonely.So really your question is based on the false premise that friendship is a delusion therefore I have no answer to no question.Could it be true that the only way to experience deep happiness is to engage in a healthy relationship? No. But it sure helps.,lonely,ct3ww77,2,t5_2qjny

If people really valued what you say they do and what they say they do then the world wouldnt be what it is.  Just think about is for a while.I understand your frustration. Humans are ultimately animals and a lot of hatred concerning entitlement is just anger over the cognitive dissonance that this baselevel behavior provokes in the mind when brought up because everyone wants to think they are above that.Just really think about it. Few people will go I am not attracted to all these amazing things I am attracted to a nice body and confidence above all else I like to be around people that make me feel cool it sound superficial. Few people will outright admit that sort of superficiality. Just really think about it.It hurts but its true.  I hope you find connection with another human soon.

I have some collegues but thats it.In the th year I finally realized how lonely I really am and Ive so far tried many different methods of making friends even had two relationships.The major tool is indeed facebook. I can recommend you to join many facebook groups for meetup events such as New in insert your town name here etc. Just join any events that are offered there usually there are multiple events every week. Itll make you feel less lonely and you will meet likelyminded people with the same issues.I wish you the best of luck!! And youre not alone! ,lonely,d434lcf,2,t5_2qjny

Maybe set up a fitness schedule in your living room. You wont stick to it. But it doesnt matter. Dont give up. Keep picking yourself up an trying again and eventually youll hit your stride. Youll be attending therapy regularly and figuring out the best plan to make progression with your life. Youll be sticking to your fitness routine and what was once an intense strain will become fun and youll want to push yourself harder. But maybe just focus on one thing now. Remember that every day is a new day and take every new day as a new chance. Believe in yourself and you can become the person that you want to be. Remember that youre a human and you can reinvent yourself. Take your time. Maybe in a few months youll be in the same situation. Maybe within the next few months you would have shed a small amount of weight and maybe have a plan for the future. Maybe just think of a goal for the end of the year. As small or large as you want. Think of the confidence boost reaching this goal will get you. Dont be hard on yourself. Theres always another chance. ,lonely,dca63v4,2,t5_2qjny

10441820,0,t3_5pj8nw,I think I know how you feel. I was in similar situations at certain points. What helped me with not knowing how to act to a situation or what to reply when someone speaks to me was observing how other people react and what they reply in real life in movies in books. Then I was analysing what I saw and tried to remember how to act if similar situation happens the next time. Also observing peoples faces and their body language can actually help you decide if the situation is funny or not. What is very important to me in becoming less scared of human contact is positive thinking that you can be the person you want to be and that youre NOT worthless. You may be different from them but it doesnt mean youre worse. But in regards to what you like you definitely shouldnt change your hobbies for others. If you wish I can recommend you a good book about dealing with insecurities and false beliefs about yourself and etc. And btw I like the things you listed as your hobbies as well and hate clubbing too. I hope I made you feel a little better. You just need to believe in yourself. I believe in you!,lonely,dcrnr58,1,t5_2qjny

10724709,0,t1_ddfpwnr,Actually your FWB comment comes off as very condescending. Not everyone can go out and pick someone up at the bar. Not everyone has a friend who they could use to jump into a casual sex relationship. More often than not that would bring about the end of the friendship anyway because sex creates emotional bonds regardless. Honestly I dont think anyone on this subreddit would be the type of person who even WOULD do that. Loneliness is not cured by going out and having a one night stand. That would actually enforce loneliness because sex without intimacy usually brings feelings of guilt.No it is not too late for OP to find someone. It might not be too late for ucoinneachf either  user just needs to meet the right person.

How many people can claim that they stood by everybofy around them took the blows and survived? How many people can claim for certain that theyll never know death in any one form?.You are in top percentile man just keep in mind that its lonely at the top. Ever time that you thing that youre giving a piece of yourself away I believe that youre giving it away in favour of a better piece. With each person that you help you improve yourself. Inbetween those people you might be feeling loneliness and despair and I would argue that these emotions are your driving force to improve youself. Im sure that apart from this image of yourself you are a motherfucking legend thats living THE life. You just got used from a very young age to tune it out and focus on the things that you communicated to us in this channel. In a pararel universe you would be posting in a channel about proud legends. Take it easy on yourself in your mind  I know I have to!,lonely,degk1vw,1,t5_2qjny

11062460,0,t3_5xykp3,You sound like a smart person and you have pretty good awareness of what is making you feel the way that you do.  All I can say is that college will probably be a very different situation.  THat could be bad or good for you.  If you are able to work on your social skills you could make some good friendships. You will meet a lot of girls etc.  Its normal that you have a crush on someone now and I know youre sad that it doesnt seem meant to be.  STill you should realize that college will give you so many romantic opportunities.  If you think you have a shot you could try to open up to her but dont think of it as a allornothing situation.  Everything you do should be working towards becoming a more interesting and appealing person.  Maybe you could start working out more and losing weight if you think that would improve your confidence.  Good luck OP,lonely,delwu1m,1,t5_2qjny

Going home and doing nothing by yourself every day is going to be depressing. Id encourage you to join a gym go to yoga take community art classes learn martial arts learn to dance learn to play an instrument meet up for board game night at your local comic book store... or if you are into sports find a local sports bar and watch the game with others. Just get out of the house and participate in the world. If you are feeling too sad to get out then you should also look into therapy. The point is Its up to you to create a busy life for yourself. Life wont come knocking down your door you have to go out and embrace it.Good luck and I hope things improve for you. Take care.,lonely,dg6gt6z,3,t5_2qjny
