1859817,0,t3_2cf53x,Im curious is there any particular reason you did it with a document like this rather than using Google Drive or something similar?Anyway if possible Id really like to see the results. Im interested in starting to learn one of Tolkiens Elvish languages and it could be useful to see how other people approached it.,sindarin,ckdawmb,1,t5_2vugl
2392787,0,t1_cm7g7go,gt May I repost this into rquenya  to ask for further ideas?Certainly! gt There are a few cultures where family names are still patronymics such as presentday Iceland. Should I add my fathers first name to the translation notes?That would help. The only elf whose personal introduction I recall is Gildor Inglorion of the House of Finrod giving his name his fathers name and a house name. The claim of descent from Finrod is nonsensical as the legendarium stands so house of X must mean both descent e.g. the House of Feanor and the household of a lord.,sindarin,cm7gf3r,1,t5_2vugl
2516478,0,t3_2nmgmu,From what I have read the mutations are made to make a phrase easier to say at least the soft mutation is. For example the word for no one is Uben Coming from  which negates pen Somebody. I personally think that Uben is easier to say than Upen. And on the note of the how ch is pronounced it is pronounced as a longer h closer to the ch in Bach.,sindarin,cmn1ibq,1,t5_2vugl
9511985,0,t3_5b3opg,I wouldnt tattoo that on myself. Firstly gd is incorrect like many other words used in the movies its lenited for no reason. It should be cd or better yet coth And Tolkien played around with daedeloth a lot were not exactly sure about its final form and meaning. Any other translation andor transcription would look just as beautiful and I would be more willing to help with it.,sindarin,d9ljyss,2,t5_2vugl
11106058,0,t3_5yjks7,Saurons Anvil shows the original inscription of the One Ring as uSartorResartus pointed out. Ash nazg durbatulk...The New Ring however doesnt share the same inscription. What you see there is gibberish. Something like ... mjf w w ... sound values given according to IPA in the Phonetic Mode of Tengwar. This is caused by the fact that Tengwar Fonts are not made for our keyboards so when we type in them without a transcriber they result in gibberish. It is surprising that they were not aware of this seeing how much effort was put into the announcement trailer and since the previous game at least tried yet here we are.But if we trace the letters back to the keys it seems they were going for I redeem the land of shadow. Which would be Rn i nr lum in Sindarin and it would look like this,sindarin,deqv1o1,14,t5_2vugl
