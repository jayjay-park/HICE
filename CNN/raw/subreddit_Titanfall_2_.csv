9503256,0,t1_d9kg5xr,I am not wanting the game to change to fit the way I play I want the game to change to actually be consistent with its own gameplay. They give me an animation I see the battery in my hand thus I should have the damn battery. Games these days have a crap ton of animation cancelling involved in them and they still work just fine. Hell I can remember back in the days when I still played Call of Duty which the majority of the staff at Respawn also created how you could do a YY or a sprint reload trick canceling the animation for reloading in half sometimes. Game still worked just fine. Whats weird is that the Call of Duty reload trick is an example of animation cancelling that doesnt make sense yet is helpful. you never chamber a round in the gun but you can still fire. And yet in TF here is an animation that by any sense means that I have successfully stolen the battery yet if I do animation cancel it it cancels altogether. You could say that a titan would smash through a wall to kill me and that the developers keep the wall there to keep the game playable but that also completely fucks up the consistency of the game. Its like being shot by a fifty caliber rifle through a cinderblock wall without a hole being made in the cinder block wall. Can a fifty cal rifle go through cinderblock? Certainly. Can it do it without making a hole? No. You cant have your cake and eat it too in the end TF is still a great game and all but thats a sign of sloppy craftsmanship,Titanfall_2_,d9kh8zs,1,t5_3e7bx
9515188,0,t3_5b0lit,Titanfall is a way more fun game imo.  The campaign is second only to dooms and the mp is so much fun.  Battlefield is a great game but it doesnt offer that fresh feeling Titanfall has.,Titanfall_2_,d9ly77p,2,t5_3e7bx

10231305,0,t1_dc3rmnv,I second this I never have to queue long for the mixtape playlist either which includes all game modes. Also the number of people playing has been going up quite rapidly in the last month or so and I think this will only continue.,Titanfall_2_,dc3rxqp,1,t5_3e7bx

10553527,0,t3_5qs3hg,Northstar is such an underdog its unreal. Tie it with the extra battery perk and you have a sniper that does some really good support damage and a decent amount of health incase things get hairy and if you are a good enough shot you can reeeeally pisses off some pilots who stand in one spot for that extra second. Not to mention the little bastard is fast as hell. I used Ion for a while and loved every second but I am so glad I gave Northstar a shot. ,Titanfall_2_,dd4d0c7,2,t5_3e7bx
