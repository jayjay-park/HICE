Maybe if you cut them off and such alright thats a little more advance but not by much.The trappers special ability is the bear traps. These require intense foresight planning understanding of psychology and a little gambling too in order to be used effectively. Whereas current killers are now just roaming the map trying to pick off the first person they see traps require fundamental understanding of generator spawns holdout clusters and the usage of bait to encourage people to walk into traps.The reason why I emphasize the usage of traps is because trapping a survivor earns you a whopping  points and grabbing them off a trap another .

If you are camping a spot as survivor the crows will make a ton of noise. To get rid of this work on a generator for a second and they will go away.

7990115,0,t1_d4e5s2r,Your argument is definitely valid.I would support my idea if its a valid effort from the developers side. Adding an alternative collapsed ledge model for the  different ledges in the game as well as a small animation Doesnt have to be very detailed can have a small smoke particle to mask the animation.I might be wrong about how intrusive a HUD indication might be but Id also argue that the preferred method again would be developing alternative animations for an exhausted player. I dont think  seperate states of exhaustion would be good  its too many different situations and a nice feature in DbD is the simplicity and straightforwardness of the health system.Id suggest a player gets exhausted after vaulting twice in rapid succession and then their vaults are very slow afterwards until theyve had a short rest. This mechanic would clearly nerf windowcheesing it would be somewhat clear to a player Okay Ive vaulted twice now I need to run for a bit before I can vault again and the Killer could even track how much the player has vaulted in a short timespan to try and outplay them.,deadbydaylight,d4e5yhx,1,t5_3cb2g

8010813,0,t1_d4ga2fd,Looking at the alpha stuff of Friday though...Not sure if itll scratch the same itch. With what theyve shown it seems like Jason is going to be obscenely clunky. They didnt show any individual striking so kills might be tied to set animations rather than weakening campers and then killing them. Unlike the killers standing on just a thin line of advantage some debate too thin Jason seems omnipresent with an incredible advantage over campers. Crystal Lake also seems massive in comparison to the maps in Dead by Daylight not as oppressive and walled off.While the Friday the Thirteenth game will likely capture the essence of the film franchise with how much the developers are really putting into it that might not translate into the experience into a good experience upon looking at the gameplay footage. Everyone gets a different more modified experience in Dead By Daylight which more acts like a Deadliest Game situation with overtones of HorrorSlasher flick aesthetic.The killers have to hunt and track survivors and use the terrain and mind games to sacrifice the survivors but Jason doesnt seem to need anything from what i can see. The Counselors dont appear to have any chance at a distance.Thats just my impression at least. This is alphafootage and things are likely to change closer to release but how much I do not know.,deadbydaylight,d4ghnex,1,t5_3cb2g
8010941,0,t1_d4gcnlf,Then maybe you should stop being obvious. Everyone always hides behind structures nearby rather than flat abandoning an area.Coldwinds fucking brutal because of those cornfields.  A survivor with a little pluck and placement could hide in between the rows of a killer approaching nonparallel. Its something that really shouldnt work well but if you get behind a few rows stay down and still the killers can pass right by you.Also if you stay in one place for too long crows will start circling you in the air pointing you out to the killer. Also again  dont run everywhere yes especially when hurdling things  but something Ive noticed within killers including myself is my inability to turn around and  retrace my steps after losing someone crawling or in certain cases running back the way the killer came into an area is often a great way to create some space as they will drop the idea to retrace their steps as theyve already looked there.Also one last time what kind of attitude is that?

8027913,0,t3_4p4c22,Like its fully possible to go full Sam Fisher fix  generators by yourself and leave without ever having the killer see you and still derank because you only netted k points in the game. You pretty much HAVE to get chased and lose the killer a couple of times or hope someone else gets hooked and the killer isnt camping in order to rank up most matches. However playing cat and mouse with an actually good killer means you cant fix objectives because youre too busy desperately trying to find a fence to hop. So right now in order to rank up as a survivor in most games you need to fill out an entire grocery list of tasks in each bloodpoint category in order to rank up.Objectives Contribute repairs to the equivalent of  Generators reminder that opening a gate counts as  points. Id say use map to farm more points but honestly Objectives is the easiest category to cap out on. Boldness Get chased and escape at least twice OR sabotage  hooks.Altruism Either heal two other survivors or rescue one from a hook. Altruism is reliant upon both your teammates and the killer being lessthanaverage at their roles so dont count on being able to get points often from this category. Survival Survive the match and escape. While you DO get some points for a few other things escaping alone will cap out your k points in this category. Honestly the easiest way to reliably rank right now is to get a toolkit or farm up the saboteur perk fix  generators and then just down a couple of hooks before you bug out. ,deadbydaylight,d4iev5c,1,t5_3cb2g

If they nerv all those spots and survivor perks they also have to nerv the killer somehow remove the footprints or lower his speed otherwise the game would be broken again. Window hopping also requires skill from the survivor i never managed to juke a killer around that tree for a longer period of time. Of course if the killer is dumb and just runs around in the same direction all the time like in the video above its eaay to juke him. If the killer tries to fake the survivor out all he needs is  mistake and the survivor is dead. Some spots feel kinda to easy though like  window autohaven house and should be changed,deadbydaylight,d4m5rr6,-6,t5_3cb2g

I took the hit  got hooked and was sacrificed that match.  It would be nice if you could  people could fit through narrow openings like door ways.

Straight up give that window a hard over head swing with his big fucking weapon and walk through the broken wood chips like the badass motherfuck he is. Should take him no longer than it takes to destroy wood pallets. After chasing down lame ass survivors I want them to watch as I destroy their precious little cheesing spot. I would make the buttons M to climb through windows M to destroy windows. Simple and in character of the killer. Plus it makes sense. If he could destroy wood pellets then he should be able to destroy windows.Edit Now that I think about it. The killer should be able to jump over wood pellets. Should take the same amount of time as it takes to vault over windows. This way the killer has more options. Do you vault over because its faster and continue trying to catch you prey or do you risk loosing them in order to destroy the obstacle for good.,deadbydaylight,d4q78up,0,t5_3cb2g

8124959,0,t1_d4tagif,You seem very keen on what puts pressure on the survivors but not the killer.The killer moves much faster than the survivor. Seeing a survivor use sprint boost is intended to put pressure on the killer to hit them before sprint boost comes back up.I agree that Id like to see sabateur reworked or rather hookless killing reworked but it puts pressure on the killer to check his hooks as well as the generators.Ill point out that sprint was likely only overpowered because activating it twice was enough to get to a cheese spot  you even say this yourself  Killer finds you you sprint get hit fly away to a spot you know either to cheese or to waste his time  by the way wasting his time in this context puts pressure on the killer to consider making his rounds for objectives rather than go for this one survivor.I get that the game could be frustrating for killers  but it could also be frustrating for survivors and this patch was entirely onesided. There was not a single bit of good news for survivors in it despite plenty of survivor complaints. THAT more than anything else is what irks me.Edit As for the v that means the killer has  targets to go for. Consider If there were  survivors on the map do you think the killer would ever fail to get one? Because there isnt anything the  in this case can do to the  the odds are actually in the killers favor if there are more survivors providing that he only has to catch   .Im NOT upset that killers got buffed so saying killer was underpowered isnt really countering my argument. I dont have gameplay stats on me  only anecdotes  so I cant make any such claim but I will say that certainly this much nerfing for survivors and buffing for killers is likely too much just from that previous anecdotal experience.,deadbydaylight,d4tbgzq,3,t5_3cb2g
8125164,0,t1_d4tbsy7,My way of thinking is the killer is a puppet of the Entity which is constantly creating new killers and disposing of the old ones. They should feel pressured to sacrifice. They arent immortal gods playing with the survivors  theyre on a mindslaved quest to please their god and they SHOULD be terrified of failure.This isnt your web  its the Entitys and you should FEEL that way.But that aside boards go away forever... if youre chasing survivors they should become scarce enough that the spots that have two boards that you actually have to break as opposed to just sidestepping are minimal. Id actually like to see the killer be able to preemptively break boards  it would be a timewaster to break all of them but you could break one or two that seem problematic before they become such.But thats a problem with boards not sprint right? And its not broken  it lets the survivor escape by using up resources  and make no mistake boards are resources.Im just worried that the game wont be fun as survivor when you fial to be able to escape at all and the only thing you can do is cower in a corner and wait for the heartbeat to go away. I want to encourage interaction  I want chase scenes and highvoltage gameplay... if you cant ever get away from the killer youre going to have a LOT more cautious gameplay if the survivor cant sabotage the hook right next to him plan an escape route or be confident that one hit wont take them down.Chasing is the most fun part of this game catching is the most satisfying. When those things become onesided the game wont be fun. Believe it.,deadbydaylight,d4tcawv,3,t5_3cb2g

Something will eventually need to happen. The next meta is already being done at High Rank play and it is incredibly effective.Why finish a Generator in the beginning of the game? That just gives Killers less area to patrol. As a Survivor you dont have to finish a Generator to get points for Objective and all it does is alert the Killer where someone is.

I dont think it ever was intended to be used by healing in front of the killer. We have medkits for that. Claudettes perk will increase charges on medkits as well.Sprint burst is really effective if you dont run when you dont need to. If you just run every where you might have the skill on cooldown when the killer sees you. Just need to manage the cooldown properly. I dont think sprint burst should be able to be used more than once a chase. Jakes sabotage is still effective. You always have the option to sabotage hooks even though its slow and this perk makes your toolkits more effective as well.I think self heal and sabotage perks are meant to be used with the equivalent items and have a weak version of them if you dont have one.

No.  It isnt.I think maybe youre trying to fight battles on too many fronts.  My point is simple.  I dont want to simply copy and paste my initial response but...thats it.  Things arent simple just because you say they are simple.  Going a step further even a fix that is simple doesnt necessarily go from the lab directly to your pretty face.  Bugs are reported by the group of folks who actually take the time to make a proper bug report on the DbD Steam Forums  Once reported they get added to never ending todo list.  You know the todo list right? That list of things that no matter the order the bugs are fixed the Developers will be called incompetent for fixing them in the wrong order.  That list.  Once bugs on that list are fixed they generally pass by the QA team.  This process can include some backandforth from Development to QA until the patch for release is satisfactory.  Then the patch is neatly packed up and delivered to the ever patient gamers.There are steps along the way that complicate even the smallest of updates.  Keep in mind the process.  Even if the exact backend fix for the bug youre upset about is merely a single line of codethat doesnt mean its something that is remedied in the time it takes you to post an angry rant on Reddit.

I think it survivor found should only apply to survivors who are standing up  anything else its hard to tell if the killer can see them or not.And I love people hiding  it is so much more fun than those who run and juke. I have so much more respect for those who are ballsy enough to hide behind a rock Im about to walk past even if it gets them brutally murdered the few times I check than those who immediately sprint towards the nearest window when I even come near them.Its also scarier for the survivor when a killer walks past them and scrapes against them.

This will waste more of their time trying to help him and if he self heals he will be in worse map position to make progress.    Bring them to an area closer to the basement but also favorable for chasing.  Such as a map corner or an area youve smashed palettes previously  This gives you a better shot at getting them a nd time.  Remember they only need  hit nowIf you do try to transport them remember that when they escape they will land  degrees behind you.

8650439,0,t1_d6mwejj,Why would the trapper be on the other side of the map of where his trap is? Sabotaging traps the killer hasnt set yet hasnt changed so why bring it up? Its not like there are many games where all your unused traps have been sabotaged and if the game has been going on that long youve probably pipped anyway.And if a trapper is chasing someone halfway across the map away from where he set his traps hes not very good. With the sabotage change I dont think people are going to be disarming any traps unless as you said the killer is nowhere near and even then its somewhat risky since the killer could be at the edge of the heartbeat range and could come back at any time meaning if you disable the trap the hit is nearly guaranteed. I do agree that sabotaging traps that were set needed to be nerfed but I dont think this was the correct thing.

In my opinion this is more like a priority issue rather than a collision issue.

8688980,0,t1_d6r4sqe,I think a killer with some sort of enrage mechanic would be cool. Like for each hook thats been sabotaged or for each survivor that gets unhooked or generator that gets done he gets a little faster and more dangerous.Maybe a killer with an oppressive aura I always thought Unnerving Presence should work like this like being near him causes you to slowly accumulate stacks of a debuff that makes your character whimper more breath more loudlyraggedly or even darkens your vision until you are away from him for long enough for the stacks to expire again.Could be one with a straightup hook. Like Pudge from DotA Devourer from HoN Blitzcrank from LoL I think? Stitches from HotS Roadhog from Overwatch... A hook that you throw a distance and use to reel a survivor in.Could be one with a bolas the two weights attached by a rope that Batman throws at people running from him and it ties their legs together and they trip and fall.Could be alternate traps for the trapper that slow you down until someone helps you remove it from your leg or something.I guess these arent really Roles but your question was very openended so whatevs those are some of my ideas I thought about instead of getting work done this morning,deadbydaylight,d6rr0kz,2,t5_3cb2g

8690731,0,t1_d6rqfuz,Thats a very fair point and I guess t comes down to anecdote.  Ive gotten pretty good at the game now so I survive most of my games.  When I lose its normally because I lose hard meaning I get caught super early and am camped or something along those lines.  Ive definitely had games where I was chased for  minutes and was finally caught but I still pipped and stuff but those seem to be more rare for me.  But like I said thats anecdote so that wont be everyones experience.  I will say though that I dont know what the devs envision for their three dead survivors to have done during the game.  Theres only so little each individual survivor can do if any of them gave the killer some struggles throughout the chase.  Especially at higher ranks someone keeping the killer busy for  minutes means  gens popped.  The survivors would have to die pretty quickly for the killer to get three of them constantly.  ,deadbydaylight,d6ryx5a,1,t5_3cb2g

But with this season they made it incredibly easy  for good players to rank up. They did it so they could spread out the people in rank  to better ranks which was a good plan but in doing so they might aswell have removed the rank sytem for high ranks.

8767130,0,t1_d71gd9c,You call me a whiny bitch but you dont refute my point at all. Id be happy to have you camp me all day long. The fact is youre going to lose.Ultimately people are playing this to have fun. Competing is part of it but theyre playing for fun. the argument Ive put forward is that that is a strategy that encourages gameplay that isnt fun.The Victim gets to sit there for ages waiting. IMO not fun.The other survivors get to sit in a bush nearby. IMO not fun.OR they run around booting up generators without the threat of a killer IMO little fun you likely get to escape but the victory is hollow without the threat of a killer chasing you.OR they make a ridiculous play to try and save the victim anyways. IMO kind of fun but for that to be fun you need to believe you can save that victim and occasionally be successful. But it will always fail with the killer refusing to leave the victims side.And finally the killer gets to stand there and wait for the victim to die. IMO not fun.OR the Survivors  foolishly run up and try to save them anyway and die anyways. IMO little fun you get to win and do your job but you didnt accomplish anything other than the victory. You didnt hunt the survivors down or outthink them. You posted up shop and waited for them to defeat them self.You accuse me of being a whiny bitch as if my comment comes from the place of a frustrated survivor. Well it doesnt. As a newer player I see this as a strategy other than what the devs intend and ultimately hurts the player experience. As a killer especially a noob I feel heavily drawn to ensuring that my prey stays caught and staying in the immediate vicinity of the survivor. You also make the point that the killer could just have a mori and kill the survivor he catches. Good! As for said Im not coming from this as a frustrated survivor. That would keep the pace of the game going. The survivor has been caught and is killed as punishment but the pace of the game continues and the killer continues to hunt.As far as your comment of wanting to watch the player die anyways and gladly having it take longer is fine. Every game has its trolls. If you want to sit there and ruin someone elses experience and in doing so ruin your chances of winning fine. Every game has its trolls. Some people drive around in rocket league only trying to blow up a specific enemy. The difference is that that Rocketleague strategy is not a path to victory so it is discouraged. ,deadbydaylight,d71jywl,1,t5_3cb2g

Honestly games where people dont infinite dont run into my face and beg me to chase so we can play parkour simulator dont bodyblock are one of the funnest games. But when survivors start abusing shit to gain aggressive advantages when they are not meant to be the aggressor I just feel like this whole thing is a farce. I want to try and hunt. Instead I feel like Im trying to solve stupid fucking worthless riddles while Dwight teabags and taunts at me from his retard stupid infinite. Fuck.I dont even mind if you run an infinite once or twice to really get me spun around.

Dont want too much power creep. but if the killers get passives too a little bit of power creep wouldnt matter anyway..For Dwights photographic memory how aboutallows the ability to track black locks and exit gates which are visible to you permanently. When a black lock or exit gate opens it is revealed to all survivors even if Dwight is dead.It could potentially save the last survivors live by showing them where the hatch is which is a cool interaction. And if you save someone after the exit door opened theyll know where to run.Also passives could have  tiers. The first tier is a small bonus for example with the photographic memory you dont track them permanently and they dont get shared with other survivors when opened but only show when the exits are powered or youre the last survivor.To upgrade it to tier  you have to use a perk slot which upgrades the passive to full strength. Either theyre not teachable or teaching them to other characters will give them the weaker tier  passive at the cost of a perk slot.Some of the currently useless perks could actually become tier  passives such as deja vu,deadbydaylight,d7frm1o,1,t5_3cb2g

Theyd have to seriously redesign certain buildings like the Ironworks factory and they have other things to do with their time. Just boarding up every window would be a massive nerf to survivors and hurt the game far worse than infinite abuse does. Many options have been suggested for how to stop infinite abuse but all of these things require a lot of coding or redesign. It is something the devs care about and will continue trying to fix but its not that simple. In the meantime I feel like the majority of players who know about the existence of infinites hate them. There are many survivor players who will go out of their way to block an infinite abuser so the killer can catch them for example.,deadbydaylight,d7ge584,1,t5_3cb2g

8944906,0,t1_d7mzyts,Thats not true at least in my region Oceania. People either divebomb for the save or just sit nearby watching the hooked guy get camped. It tends to happen because once again theyre rank  so they dont know any better. Killers take advantage of that fact and usually get  more survivors easily.I agree that  SWF with toolboxes demolishes hooks and is unfun. The fix IMO isnt to add a nd basement because the st basement is already so broken. Its nice that you run far enough away for saves to happen but I find very very few killers do that where Im from.

Try placing traps near juke spots but not where theyll expect it most.

9012347,0,t1_d7v0fuw,So the chains themselves do not stack. So if you used begrimed chain which is both the rusted and grisly chain combined then there is no point to put on a rusted chain grisly chain if you have the begrimed equipped. What stacks is the debuffs from hitting someone with any of the chains. So if I have a rusted chain you will have  stack of that debuff. Then if I chainsaw you for a second time then you will have  debuffs on you. I hope that makes sense. So if a billy has any of the chain addons and he hits you multiple times with the chainsaw it will keep stacking on top of each other. This is what needs to be fixed along with what the original post said. As a funny side note if you are hit but the grisly chain reduces repair speed enough times then you will actually make generator progress go backwards.

Every day the frontpage explodes with complaints some of which are entirely appropriate. Around comes a patch that pretty much implements  of what the community wanted and  novelty features but the community can not deal with the consequence of the buffs and nerfs they so much asked for. Then everyone goes ahead and blames the Devs again until the next patch comes around.It doesnt help that actual criticism gets downvoted because obviously the downvote button is a I DISAGREE WITH YOU AND THINK YOU ARE AN IDIOT machine instead of hiding posts that are not contributing to any discussion at all.TLDR The DbD is largely very entitled for no reason at all and doesnt like when they have to adjust their playstyle.,deadbydaylight,d7zwns5,4,t5_3cb2g

9080277,0,t1_d839rjy,Lets just use their logic to figure out a solution. Their claim Games are too short against SWF its even worse. In SWF They all are talking to each other.  and because of this they know when its safe to both RepairSave for free. If this is true than they know youre camping and wont bother saving they will just continue rushing gens and The survivor will also struggle to the end wasting as much of your time as possible.IMHO Killers set the pace of the game. if you want longer games walk away from hooks.Ill prove it with the above model.In SWF They all are talking to each other.  and because of this they know when its safe to both RepairSave for free. If you walk away after hooking. And i dont mean patrol i mean leave  will go save for the save. Now theres at max only  people working on a generator.While that survivor is being unhookedretreatedhealed you can find another survivor working on a generator and start chasing him. Now theres only  person dedicated to generators thats a whole lot better than giving a free pass to . Rinse and repeat. The skill is being able to minimize the time to find another victim after you leave the hook.This ends with YOUR GAMES BEING LONGER MORE POINTS MORE SACRIFICES AND MORE FUN FOR EVERYONE.

9155259,0,t3_55oh2c,Good job on the infinites. Have doubts about what they say about point farming.Points are essential in this game to level up. Thats the single reason why people didnt yet organise groups of five people to casually play on private matches. They want points. They want to progress. So points are essential to implement and encourage different playstyles. If flashlight for example doesnt give enough points then it discourages people from using it and risk their ass. Theyd rather escape or keep repairing generator. You want survivors to use it and try it in the game? Just give more points for it. People will start doing that shit constantly because greed. Map fix was in my opinion too harsh.  points maybe a little bit too much of a nerf. However I started using quite often against Trapper killers to find traps.

9491976,0,t1_d9j1unu,I think the patch is heading in an overall bad direction in terms of strategy. The ability to regress generators is going to fuck up the  strategy. Which encourages survivors to simply genrush.The sabo changes are going to make it so that sabo has no real strategic value. Again encourages genrush.The IG nerf is more or less fine given the hook changes. Most killers will just run Agitation if it becomes a problem. So no major gameplay changes there.The infinite hook BS is apparently to discourage camping but its not based on hook proximity which is real stupid and punishes noncamping killers. Its probably going to encourage patrolling. Which is better than facecamping. Though this could have also been accomplished by making the changes proximity based. So overall it seems like the devs really want survivors doing nothing but repping gens  in one go. And killers banging on gens. Seems like theyre making the overall strategy and depth of the game much narrower and more linear. Which is bad.But well see what makes it to live and in what form.,deadbydaylight,d9j37rc,1,t5_3cb2g

9569517,0,t3_5bw330,Yeah rank s problems  I am not saying it to offend the new players not in any way its just a sad reality.Its just... frustrating. The majority of my matches the killer is rank  as well and  other survivors have either none or  perks in their loadout. The problem is that they are not even trying. They disconnect after a single hit or the very first dying state. IF they somehow made it to the hook  they struggle and then dont mash space. I dont know the reason for it but maybe they are scared maybe they think that they lost and of course they dont think about their teammates.And here I am altruistic af with my Empathy  Well make it running and sneaking around ready to unhook noobies and tank the hitoccupy killer for a bit. I just never make it to them in time. They DC almost at once and all that is left are  generators hardly even started me and and a rank  Dwight hiding in the closet with the crows over his head. I can run around the pallets for a bit sure thing might use a window or two to loose LOS but I will not be able to fix all  gens by myself. And you know what is the worst part? The killers are not even that good! Most of them have less than  hours in game. They are easy to be juked around they are blind and get stunned near every pallet loosing the survivor so quick. They heard something about the hitbox thats why they are trying to hit you from almost a mile away hoping to land a hit. But because they play mostly against rank s and mostly Myers who never ends the match with less than . they climb ranks EXTREMELY quick.TLDR The killer became so simple  its just find hit run hit again hook walk around.

Mix of paranormal  something more monstrous.  A Lovecraftian horror would be straightup creepy as hell if done right.  Especially if it has a sanity minigame where simply being seen by survivors will slowly tear at their sanity and make them start hallucinating i.e. other survivors would gain terror radiuses to a survivor whos losing their sanity.   That would create a really interesting new sort of game for survivors as they would want to avoid having their camera on the killer as much as possible.  Otherwise theyd start to be scared of their own teammates and would have to determine when altruistic plays are safe or not like imagine someone whos been thrown into insanity trying to go save someone on a hook  the hooked survivor would have a terror radius to where you wouldnt be able to make decisions off of sound alone.

Yeah its awful when someones taking you to pallet town and you finally down them only to have them DS out of your grasp and do it all over again. Infinites are definitely the worst problem that needs fixed right now. The Entity feeds on hope so the killers need some hope of killing survivors too.Still I dont think DS on its own is overpowered or needs reworking. Sometimes a survivor deserves a second chance. Sometimes its the only hope for the team. The problem is people abusing the system. Instead of trying to escape and hide from the killer theyd rather waste your time. I usually let these people go and hope I find them at a more vulnerable point in time. At the very least it keeps people from doing generators while Im distracted.Ive been playing survivor more recently and I just prestiged for the first time meaning my perks reset. I have to say I feel helpless without the security of Decisive Strike. Between camping andor tunneling killers legit tunneling i.e. staying close enough to a hook that when a survivor is unhooked you can just walk up down them again and rehook and survivors who would rather do gens than even bother trying to save you survivors need a selfsufficient way to protect themselves.,deadbydaylight,da1irkh,11,t5_3cb2g

The survivor can also play any way he wants.Believe it or not but survivors also have arbitrary rules for who they infinite. If you drop us while we try to use Decisive Strike?

Combined with sprint burst this can be  seconds as well dont sprint when youre landing offDark sense is situationally useful to know which escape to immediately go for and to counter Bitter Murmur you can know if hes going or looking at youLeader is definately useful in a some cases especially in SWF if you play that but even without you can do gens much faster especially with repair toolboxes if you have the team. I just wish they buff it with increased point gen.Resilience is very useful if you can pair it with Selfcare keep it at  and you get a free speed boost insta heal if the killer is starting to be in terror radiusI agree with slippery meat though.

If all  survivors had the same perk and the same mindset it would be more of a selfish race of anything and your perk in the end will be nullified should you be late. It is a useful perk if I ever want to stockpile items but I cant deny that sometimes I spawn away from every chest and everybody else doesnt and when I come to the chests themself They are either looted or Im gonna start being chased by EW myers whom snuck up on me and when I come back to it its looted.I just have my personal gripe with the perk its probably me and with my luck but I also wish it did more like maybe allow you to loot from looted chests already or perhaps give you addons or something. I have more luck just not having the perk on tbh.,deadbydaylight,da9cxb9,1,t5_3cb2g

However it also prevents you from taking damage and avoids the chance of honingdiamond stone.Unhooking first and getting trapped afterwards was faster even with the untrapping animation and shared the points gain one person gets unhook  potential heal the other gets untrap  potential heal. It was necessary if you planned to hook swap you screwed up and the killer was right there or you were against a hook camper or if the person on the hook was about to start strugglingabout to die.Now the option isnt there. At a certain point if youre against a trapper theres no point in going to save since the disarm animation takes too long.Also its bs that disarm and unhook are the SAME GODDAMNED BUTTON so if you misclick due to shitty UI theres now  people dead instead of  from before the patch.,deadbydaylight,daexbl2,3,t5_3cb2g

While there are  People slugging and youre on the hook youll see this yellowglowing meg at the other end of the map  keep doing gens and leave everything behind as she sprint bursts into Dusk.Claudettes are by far the worst kind of Survivors in my opinion. However theyre also some kinds of twoedgedswords since theyre either  the alturistic type who will try to safe your butt but once theres a sign of danger theyre the first to run away. The other type is the common Douchebag type  running instantly to the next infinite once you got eyecontact  tend to overstay in junglegyms andor get punished by using the same window  times in  seconds god bless the entityblock.

Theres a comma after Once per match and I spelled it all out for you. Granted the perks description is a little confusing but if you reread it a few times and notice that comma after once per match it should become clear as day. You get one successful Decisive Strike per match and one skill check every time the killer grabs you until you do.TLDR It doesnt say you get a skill check once per match it says you get a successful skill check one per match.

Benedict BakerPower  Fang  The fang of the wolf that fed on far to much human flesh still dripping with blood from a fresh kill... Benedict Baker Mori animations.  In human form picks up the survivor by ramming his hand through them and guts them with his other hand.  In wolf form pounces on them flips them over and rips out their throat.   Wolf form Mori can only be performed via addons.Perks  Scent of Blood  Blood drives you into a frenzy after injuring a survivor get blinded for  seconds that you cant attack during just move or channel your ability but gaining  movespeed and  missed attack cooldown reduction for  seconds.  Effectively after injuring a survivor you have a bit of downtime but have a long duration of enhanced speed and missed attack cooldown.  I saw no reason to put successful attack cooldown on it because.... well... it blindspacifies you for  seconds.  Still will work even after you down them.  Its sort of an antimachine gun build where you get one hit and get massively increased speed to try and ensure the second hit after giving them a chance to run for a bit.Perk   Thrill of the Hunt  While your obsession is injureddownedhooked Does not persist after being sacrificed fully your senses are enhanced and all survivor produced noises become  louder at a M range and you gain a  move speed boost.Perk   Terrors Calling   While channeling your power Terror radius increases  and while channelingwhile channelingalways skillchecks performed within the terror radius have no great skill check zone and  reduced good skill check zone.  Does not modify Decisive Strikes area.Final perk is something to sort of provide an alternative gameplay.  Channels pretty much always come with an announcement of sorts anyway and massive terror radius amp with the removal of great skill checks provides a powerful synergy for stalling out the game when comboed with several other terror radius amping mods.  It also massive boost the odds of people failing skill checks when comboed with a few other mods acting as a pseudo detection perk by making people far more likely to fail while in the radius which if comboed with Distressing is  Meters during the channel while Unnerving Presence further reduces the successful skillcheck zone by  resulting in a  reduced zone.  Agitation means that you sustain a wider terror radius after grabbing someone again helping boost the failure rate.  The tradeoff being that you announce yourself far in advance although a nearly map wide terror radius means people cant always trust that heartbeat for proximity.,deadbydaylight,daowf99,1,t5_3cb2g

Its not even amateur work. Its the lack of work whatsoever. Like NO ONE didnt even try to test it.You especially hit it on point with this part. If they played with the new content for even a hour Im sure theyll bump into the numerous bugs weve encountered.The most practical solution would be to use the PTB. Theres plenty of games that do this especially MOBAs that have new content coming out every month or so. A game like Smite has a public test server where they test the new contentpatch and it goes on for about  weeks. At the end of it they make adjustments to the balancing and any known bugs. Keep in mind they have a lot more variables to work with since theres so much more content in Smite compared to DBD. Smite has around  characters to balance around and so many different items and modes too  so I feel like there really shouldnt be an excuse for the DBD team only having to work around a few killers survivors items and maps.Currently the DBD dev team might be smaller but Hirez Smites dev company started off almost as small as them when they first started Smite.,deadbydaylight,db0wviz,4,t5_3cb2g

10077089,0,t3_5k3tmy, Its a lot harder to play survivor without perks than it is killer. So I would recommend leveling a survivor first. Killers are fast can see generators have lunge and have a special ability. Its enough to get to a decent rank. Survivors start with nothing so having a few perks could go a long way.a I think Claudette for SelfCare and Meg for Sprint Burst would be the best survivors to start with. SelfCare is nice so you dont have to rely on finding your teammates and could heal yourself. The loud noise you make when you are hurt can really give away your position so you want to be healed asap.b If your JUST starting out. First focus on landing those generator skill checks perfectly before trying any tricks. This is the most important part of the game and if you cant land those skill checks you probably wont get very far. After you perfect those skill checks start going for saves because unhooks are the most rewarding in terms of points. If you think you get caught by the killer too fast dont worry about it. It is the most difficult part of the game and to get better at it I would just watch streams. Not a killer main so Ill let someone else take this over.Good luck.,deadbydaylight,dbl2dpi,1,t5_3cb2g

When I was starting out someone commented that the role of the killer is almost the same as a DM from Dungeons and Dragons. you are supposed to set up a thrilling horror flick scenario for everyone involved and usually that rewards more points. You dont see horror movies where the monster stands right in front of someone and watches them slowly die. He walks off to get the others and if they so choose the other survivors can save their friend and increase their hope for a more satisfying tale. Thinking of the game as a movie means that as the killer you shouldnt camp someone and as a survivor you need to expect that a lot of people die in these movies and dying isnt always a bad thing.

10089222,0,t3_5k8fke,NOTE This is not a tutorial. This is simply what I would try first with Cheat Engine.My theoryUsing Cheat Engine equip any perk in Perk Slot . A value should be written to it so the game knows what perk youre using. Scan for a Byte variable since Bloodpoints are stored as Bytes theres no reason to think any other value is a different type.Switch the Perk in Perk Slot  to another perk. The value thats stored in the Perk Slot  address should be changed so we can scan for that.Repeat until you find the address for Perk Slot  by constantly switching out the perk in its slot then Equip Agitation. Write down the value that gets stored in the address and remember it.Repeat this entire process for Perk Slots   and .When you find the addresses for all Perk Slots equip a perk in each of them. Overwrite the values stored in them with the one for Agitation that you wrote down.The game should recognize that you have Agitation in each Perk Slot now.The hardest part about this theory is figuring out what to scan for initially. Perks could be stored as something like  for Hope I  for Slippery Meat II  for Agitation III or something like that and you simply set a scan range from  to  or it could be something completely different. I honestly dont know because I have never attempted to hack in this game.Again I dont know if this is how its done and this is all theory based off of my experience hacking various games during my childhood. In all likelihood the addresses might not be so easy to find and its all directed by pointers maybe not. I honestly dont care anymore. Seeing shit like this and the glitch where people are using killer powers on whatever killer they want made me lose all hope. Berate me for it I honestly dont give a shit anymore this is just fucked.,deadbydaylight,dbmn571,1,t5_3cb2g

10108607,0,t3_5kma2e,Someone made a thread asking this yesterday heres me answerI also started playing during the free weekend. Solely played trapper for the most part and I just recently got to rank . Heres my advice You will slaughter rank s and climb to higher ranks easily this is when the game gets a bit tough. You will get matched with high rank good survivor players with meta perks  might as well get used to this.  The killer is very important. I would recommend trapper as he has very good map control but overall a very good killer in most situations for beginners and advanced players alike. Avoid wraith and hag they are garbage tier for actually getting kills with.  Predict their moves. Lay a few traps around in places where they are likely to run such as tall grass at the very start of the match. This is important because if you do this later they will know where you put the traps and easily disarm them also you wont get time later.  Always keep one trap on you to place under their feet when you hook them. This is very important so you get an early notification when someone is going for the unhook making tracking easier. Pick your own fights. Unlike the survivors you do not have to commit to a chase if you feel you wont get anywhere. If the survivor keeps using infinites or pallet loops generally just wasting a lot of time put a trap down and move on to a different survivor check up on a generator. Keep spending blood points to get better perks. I was getting wrecked by survivors who had a set of full meta perks. It sucked for a while since Id none. Once youre on a level playing field however things get more fun.  Bait the pallet. What I mean by this is pretend to be walking towards it but take a step back at the last second so you dont get stunned. Then destroy the pallet. Remember the more pallets you destroy the more fucked the survivors are. You can often get a free hit on survivors who think you havent seen them. Walk near the but faced in a different direction as if youre walking somewhere else then quickly turn around and hit them. Bait survivors into traps. In a chase you can herd survivors around like sheep with the right moves. If you followed my earlier step of putting traps down at the start you can make survivors run towards them.  Lunge can be used to great effect. If you are quick enough you can hit survivors through windows pallets right before getting stunned a good trade and also right around corners.  Final piece of advice dont get disheartened. These survivors at higher ranks have been playing a LONG time in comparison to you and I. You likely arent bad even if you got wrecked and got no kills happened a few times to me as well. However once you get into your killer you are going to make them rage a LOT. ,deadbydaylight,dbp5uvg,1,t5_3cb2g

Once again it is not just that you COULD earn them through in game unlocks there was physically no way to buy them with real money. It was genuinely a game where if you bought it you got everything that mattered gameplay wise for the base price of the game you only missed out on cosmetics.Its understandable how people have this confused because once again holy shit did all that cosmetic dlc at launch cause everything to be a clusterfuck and probably helped kill the game.,deadbydaylight,dbydhsi,5,t5_3cb2g

10233031,0,t1_dc3mzcv,Both are busted. Its not that either are just annoying its that the game itself is designed poorly and both strats are near impossible to win against without playing like scum.If youre the shape or the hag it is almost literally impossible to keep up with genrushing. By the time you cross the map they can have two gens done and you have to take a  on which they will head to next. Get it wrong and thats a rd free gen. Then on the note of hooking it doesnt just delay the game it drags it out to an absurd degree and forces the killer to play like scum. Your choices become Slug people and get flammed Hope you have IG and Agitation so you can ferry people to the basement.But if you dont have IG or Agitation its quite simply impossible to carry people that distance. They are guaranteed an escape.This game is fundamentally designed around PUGs not organized groups. SWF was never considered when the game was being created and balanced and it shows. Strategies that have zero counterplay exist and that is simply bad game design. Removing a players win condition is literally the biggest nono in game design right before removing a failure state. And this is why both are complained about. Survivors  have the ability to remove the main way for a killer to winm with little to no repercussions since its easy to spend half the match in a single chase if youre on a map thats bad for your killer. Like Haddenfield for Nurse or Pallet Town for anyone but nurse unlucky enough to not have brutal strength. And guess what. Youll be flamed for your choices no matter what as a killer. Run IG and Agitation? Good job memeing FGGT. Slug people out? OMG you have to slug to win? Git gud. What about running NOED so you can counter the gen rush meta? LITERALLY NO SKILL.Genrushing and Sabo are literally problems with the game. They are consequences of bad game design. They are unforeseen problems that exist because the game was never designed for organized play and when they added it these problems became x more common because there is no counter play to them.,deadbydaylight,dc3yzgz,6,t5_3cb2g

You had an option to just leave her for teammates to patch her up and the game would go on as normal. Instead you decided to throw a little drama and to make sure every single of these  random people saw your giant internet balls. Yes you stood in one place probably pressing M while hitting her. Much skill required  Of course you were not at fault. YOU HAD TO! No other option! The bug happens? Facecamp. Survivor outplayed you not in this game but in any other? FACECAMP!

Wraith is the joking Killer hell play with you a bit but will always kill in the end. Billy is a raging madman with no mercy and nor fucks to give but can be short sighted and swaps targets without thinking. Hag is a savage animal that needs to feed likely to wound first then go for the kill later when the time is right.Nurse and Shape I havent gave a personality to yet. Dont play them enough to figure something out that fits how they play. Shape feels like I should stick to the movies and make him a cold thinking murderous monster.

Its easy to win but you will lose hard if you dont find someone fast.Coal tower small map and no real safe spots. The shack side of the map is a lot more dangerous for survivors so if you have the chance chase them away from the tower.Suffication pit depending on the window spawns this map can be easy or hard. Hag trapper and nurse can all deal with the infinite window but billy and wraith have a Hard time. If you get a bad window try to force the late game to the shack side of the map. Great basement if you can reach it.Iron works if people run upstairs leave them. Its not worth your time to carry them down if your not using ig or agitation. The infinite can be an issue but there is a huge blind spot you can use if they keep running it the short way just double back. But if someone keeps using it effectively it might be best to go hunting somewhere else.Wretched shop pretty fair map  there is an infinite depending on some window spawns if they use it just break line of sight and double back.Resting place best map for  gen strat you can protect one side of the map very easily otherwise it can be a nightmare to go from one far end to the other.Bloodlodge chase one guy then stop and chase someone new hopefully the new guy will not know what pales are broken and run to the wrong spot otherwise you will spend all game breaking pallets.Wreckers yard lots of pallets here but on the bright side the basement is very close. Get your first down and try to snowball with a basement hook.Thompson house I try to control the house side of the map the house is a death trap but it is surrounded by a lot of safe pallets generally tho if you stick by the house that  gen that will never get completed.Racid arbitor pretty fair map sometimes a window span will be a infinite sometimes it will be a death trap.. try to control whatever side if the map is appropriate bad window control near it.

I dont think any sane person who complains here cares if you camp because their cheating or griefing people may have different opinions about where they draw the line but noone cares about camping them. All anyone sane is actually talking about is people camping for no reason at all. Whos gonna say it was a great game after being hugged to death on a hook by a killer for no reason at all for  seconds. And who the hell would appreciate the being found and downed in the first  seconds of the game and and then camped for  seconds games. Please dont even pretend that cheaters have legitimate grounds to speak in these conversations about.Its not raging because you couldnt win. It makes the game boring as hell because killers feel that  hits  down  hook should be enough to think theyre good at the game. Not everyone cares if theyre being a Ahole in game they will camp literally because they cant imagine ever letting their hooked survivors go ever. Why would someone like this feel ashamed?

10600837,0,t1_dd9bxdy,well actually sensitivity is a reason not to play with the controller since by default its very low. i changed it now since Reku told me theres a way. feels great. i basically started as a console player as a kid nin gc xbox and got hung on it.  for me personally it just feels so much more intuitive and i love the handling with my  controller everything else they did is basically garbage just so were on the same pagegetting used to keybindings takes me a few minutes on the controller whereas the same amount of actions on a keyboard fucks me over pretty much...muscle memory probably. it got better after i got my first real pc which i havent had for a long time. having no internet at home and basically only a console for gaming  at that time pretty much forced me into peasantry. another thing is i can choose my position while playing. may not seem like a big thing to someone who has a good setup or is used to sit in a chair at a desk.i basically play from my sofa and having keyboardmouse on a tray feels clumsy to megt for games like dbd i prefer the intuitive and simple handling of the controller. i wouldnt dream playing csgo with it and i will never complain about the lack of aim sensitivity since its basically my choice. ,deadbydaylight,dd9e8ou,7,t5_3cb2g
10609140,0,t3_5rroa5,Its incredibly frustrating when you are hooked or on the ground and your only available teammate is just working on gens even though they had  opportunities to rescue you. Killers cant patrolcamp everyone keep that in mind. If they are bouncing between downed survivors theres always an opportunity to get someone up. The objective of the game isnt just to repair gens and get out its to help you team escape too and rescuing is a big part of that.

10957398,0,t3_5wf0y8,I feel like I am playing a different game. I would say Trapper is the most common killer I go against but they do not camp any more than other killers. They do trap under the hook  of the time but if they didnt camp then the trap basically just slows the survivors down. Camping is what really makes hook traps bad but again I dont get camped by Trappers over other killers its about the same ratio there are just a lot of Trappers total. I find the Hag to be the worst camper with basically  of matches. After that probably Myers or the Wraith. Then maybe Trapper or the Hillbilly that thinks leaving and then chainsaw sprinting back every  seconds does not count as camping. Hell I think even the Nurse camps just as often as the Trapper in my games.,deadbydaylight,dea6ekw,3,t5_3cb2g

10985192,0,t1_ded3zpd,No worries I am happy to help  And again do not be afraid do risky and daring stuff even if it gets your character in trouble and eventually killed. Learn practice and level up without any rush  This can be achieved only through being caught multiple times. Consider escaping not as a mandatory goal but as a nice k bonus. Every game is hard at the beginning and its better to use the momentum when you are new. About MM I think it requires practice and experience to be honest. Also when he stalks someone this person will hear a particular music that might be the key here. There is no perk that counters Myers when he is in EW  Premonition and Spine Chill do not work against him at this stage.I would say that this is a great set up of perks but you can mostly see it at higher ranks experienced survivors will run it. Self care  is very slow so it does require a medkit. Try to get at least  then it is not that painful D Empathy  is amazing. It allows you to see injured teammates everywhere so its perfect for your goal should you wish to take it be the support run to the injured guy and try to stay close. Observe and learn be aware of the situation and be ready to help when its needed. Teammate fell near the pallet? Get the stun save. Killer did not see you? Use the flashlight. Get the aggro on you when he is breaking the pallet create the route for the teammate to escape.Personally I would recommend using Premonition or Spine Chill as training wheels that helps a lot. Lightweight does magic on cornfield maps especially against the nurse. Also if you prestige your Claudette at some point and will be P she will be practically invisible. What other perks you have?You probably want to level up Meg to level  to get her teachable Sprint Burst. This is one of the best perks in game and definitely helpful. As soon as you get it as a teachable your other characters will get it as well. ,deadbydaylight,ded4xbv,2,t5_3cb2g

11208866,0,t3_5zxrik,Hell yeah buff killer dont just nerf the fucking sod because they have the ability to facecamp! With the way things are going thats pretty much all theyll do in the near future if you keep nerfing them and what they can do.In exchange for such buffs you should make mechanics that forbid facecamping! I keep talking with my friends behind the scenes that there shold be something forbidding the killer from being able to attack survivors near the hooked person. Intrinsic mechanics that reward killers who think there are survivors dancing around the hook and punish killers who just camp by disabling their ability to attack survivors and granding survs enough time to unhook the time it takes for killer to walk in and out of radius.I personally took the MORE WILDLIFE avenue to the facecamping problem and introduced bees as a solution thinking it would be humorous to have the Entity spawn bees on killers who camp. Killers who read the situation correctly would get rewarded and yeah that would make things survivor sided for the moment and I absolutely havent developed ideas for Survivor other than THEY NEED AN EARLY GAME A MID GAME AND A LATE GAME INSTEAD OF JUST DOING GENERATORS YOU GUYS! so meh. Oh well!I felt the need to rant because I feel like theyre trying to nerf Killers to compensate for something thats a flat out kick to the dick facecamping and that ultimately if they keep this up its all any killer will do... with a Trapper even! Its not good for the state of the game. I might be wrong about what I just said but Bills perks seem to confirm my hypothesis. In other words I think that Bees gt Bill.Alright rant over.

11209989,0,t1_df2m4em,. Im responding to your whole post. Your solution for fixing the frustrations the killers are facing are an overcomplicated bandaid instead of fixing the root cause of the issue.. Pallet loop isnt an issue and the best killers in the game usually dont get jerked around for multiple generators. One of the best killers in the game streamed for  hours about a week ago and had a single survivor escape during the whole stream and it was through the hatch.. . Here you go. The generator nerfs were tested on the PTB  Oct  and pushed to the live build  Oct  Adjusted generator interaction progress while multiple survivors are working simultaneously on one. amp  Adjusted skill check difficulty zones have been reduced and removed success bonus in good zone only great skill checks will provide a progress bonus  Not only that but generator time was increased by a flat rate of  seconds.. Doing generators should absolutely be a counter and was prior to the generator changes. To make this feasible again the duration of the survivors stage on the hook should be increased by  seconds or made infinite to counteract the generator nerfs.. All in all your complex solution does not fix the root cause of the issues of chases being too long. Again youre rewarding sloppy killer playing and punishing good survivor playing. You are also making generators the selfadmitted boring part of the game even more tedious.. I believe the healing change is more than likely to go through. That being said theres nothing different between theory crafting like we are now compared to theory crafting what it might be like after the change.,deadbydaylight,df2n15r,1,t5_3cb2g
11211235,0,t3_601ju2,A lot of it just comes from experience and knowing how survivors think. Survivors want to return to gens theyve already started so its likely theyll return to gens you chase them away from. When survivors are unhooked near a gen they tend to just start working on the closest gen. Knowing how survivors think can help you pick the right generators to patrol to ensure youre keeping people from finishing them.Getting better at chases just requires practice. Learn which pallets are safe and which are not i.e. try to get them to play the pallet game where you force them to drop the pallet then circle around the other side trying to get them to vault at a time where you can hit them. Swinging through pallets can also be useful especially when you do it around a corner. Dont be afraid to take a stun or two.Ultimately if you can tell a survivor is way too good at being chased just walk away from them. Get the others off of gens find someone in a less favorable position who might not be quite as skilled at being chased.,deadbydaylight,df2s47u,6,t5_3cb2g
11213935,0,t1_df330mk,You can say that about any perk then non of them are anywhere mandatory for Killer. Its not difficult to Kill  Survivors with perks while running zero perks as Killer.A Good Killer will still control the pace of the game because they will still out run you. TrapperBillyGood Nurse will shit all over people if theyre good.The discussion was never whether or not the perks were mandatory. Its what makes life easier and less of a pain to play with.

It looks like wires or something are coming out of his arms at the wrists. I dont see sleeves.What Im sure of is that the killer is a male and hes an original design.    Edit I forgot to add that theres something around his neck. I cant tell if its a shirt collar or something else the assumption that it was a shirt collar along with the apron was making me lean towards Mad Scientist. Someone mentioned the possibility of a prisoner as a killer. Prisoners normally orange collared shirts and I think the head wear is a cage but that might be a bit literal to have the prisoners head in a cage.

11588566,0,t1_dg9gpbs,I like to believe that its a very small percentage of players that do it just to do it. Most do it because the way the game plays out now its usually one of the best strategies. Survivors almost always come to save their friends and staying there gets rid of the hassle of finding them  youre protecting what youve already caught.What devs should be doing is greatly punishing camping and divebombing in terms of points and objective completion. If this is done those players will not advance far in the ranking system and will be placed where they belong while the more resourceful and intelligent players move up in rank.In the end its fine its not a big deal that they removed it its just not going to fix the core problem. Its just when the game adds more and more of these kinds of limitations that the potential of new strategy is also limited.,deadbydaylight,dg9kkt8,1,t5_3cb2g

11665736,0,t3_66gczj,sighI just want survivors to stay the way they are.I like that I can just pick who I want based on looks.Because this game is overall competitive I find it very hard to knowingly use shitty perks no matter how much I try to use perks that are clearly inferior to others I just cant help but gravitate towards the best ones.  If some ridiculous method of FORCING survivors to be unique like this happens peopleespecially people like me are not going to feel like we gained any sense of individuality or uniqueness were going to be forced to play as one character that has a specific benefit that almost clearly outshines any other.  People like me are not a small minority either both on the killer side and the survivor side the top most used perks clearly hint that the average highlevel player is like me.  We use perks that work we use perks that are going to win.When you force us to pick between characters for some silly only I can have this benefit were going to pick the most superior one. In the case of the good teachables being limited youre only going to see Claudette and to a lesser extent Meg every game....how is that individuality? The average player LOSES individuality with concepts like these. Theyre always so selfdefeating in their methods.,deadbydaylight,dgibrad,12,t5_3cb2g

Its unfun for them because they cant catch me and unfun for me because they camphard patroll my teammates to death.  Now I cant do that so if Im stuck with a new killer I just have to bully them because of the matchmaking being bad.gtSounds kinda crybaby that youd block him for a one time facecamp.If he disliked me being in his game so much that he took it personal to get me out of the lobby I dont think either of us want to play with each other anymore.  So why force us to?gtInstead maybe dont get caught next time.Game went on for  minutes already.  One survivor dead two were crouching around.  Three gens were near each other so I figured Id be a bait so my mates would actually do gens.
