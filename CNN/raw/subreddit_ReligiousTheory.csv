6830376,0,t3_49aqjj,Its been a while since Ive read this but Orpheus and the Roots of Platonism by Algis Uzdavinys might be a brief its short and interesting read for you. He takes a comparative religion approach so he like many other philologists concerned with religion identifies a theological tradition from the early Orphics through Pythagoras to Plato in the context of other ancient religions in the Mediterranean and Fertile Crescent. The question where these beliefs came from is very speculative but if you want to read the idea of Anamnesis as a still relevant one even outside the context of religion I dont believe its too far fetched to assumed there are legitimate philosophical reasons for it. Plato is attempting to answer the question how is it at all possible that we can learn facts about the world and identify them as true? This ability must be in our DNA so to speak. Immanuell Kant and Noam Chomsky hold very similar beliefs but phrase their answers through more exacting argument. ,ReligiousTheory,d0qiuya,2,t5_3cgzm
