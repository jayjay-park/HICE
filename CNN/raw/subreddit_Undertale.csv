The realization of just what an experience it was hit me so hard that I had a major regret that I did not share it actually... like I REALLY should of streamed it to not only show my support for the game.. but to have recorded the most enjoyment I had from a game in a long time... I laughed.. cried... felt despair and got filled with hope.. This was truely something special I had missed out shareing with the world.. and it rocked me to the core. BUT I starting thinking of the good. As corny as it is to say.. the determination .. and general themes of friendship... and not giving up.. and fighting for what you want in life inspired me. So yeah XD even if im never going to be able to experience the game in the same light again Im doing a giveaway to share the journey with as much people as I can now . Its all about perspective..  Also this helps me validate true resetting XD Im doing it so more people can have there own journeys.. free there own timelines.. or destroy them... I hope they dont destroy them gt.gt anyway... heres a link to my giveaway XD  Im off to engross myself in more undertale by checking out fan art fan theorys..secrets.. and ect... since I dont want to reset right now gt.gt.. ,Undertale,cvc9pml,2,t5_2xdht

5227091,0,t3_3mkg5p,I think the reason for Floweys change of heart is that being soulless doesnt automatically make him evil after all he tried being nice the first time he eventually turned into a sociopath because his abilty to eternally reset left him unfulfilled without the ability to feel love and compassion but since he temporarily got to turn back into Asriel and repent for his actions I think those memories are still fresh into Floweys mind so even though he is once again uncapable to understand love and compassion he might still instinctively try to respect the wishes of his former self... until he gets yet again sickbored of his own eternal existence I guess.,Undertale,cvg20iw,2,t5_2xdht

Theyre gentle and caring in a way that was never really returned to them in the outside world. Theyre a little bit goofy and playful but above all theyre just really happy to have found this world.

5272959,0,t1_cvlmvys,For anyone other than you who stumbles across this comment just assume that all of the fanfictions here have spoilers for everything.Here are my two favorites Home a fic that takes place near the start of the game. Quality Best Undertale fanfic out there right now in my opinion. Not perfect but definitely worth a read. Without mercy a fic that covers the Sans genocide fight. Quality Adds vivid descriptions to a scene that generally lacks them. The fallen child has some lines that are honestly good. May be difficult to read for anyone like me who has trouble watching Genocide runs but worth reading anyway.If you get through those two which you will quickly theyre both pretty short and want more I listed some other decent fanfictions below. All of these are single chapter fanfictions. So far I havent come across any ongoing fics with half decent writing. You broke our spirit a fic in which Sans reflects while attempting to stop a genocide run. Quality Decent. Knock knock a retelling of sharing jokes through the ruins door. Quality Not bad. In absence of a comfortable rhythm in which Frisk and Chara are separate minds in the same body and Chara is being unusually quiet. Quality The writing could use some work but the ideas the writing expresses are good enough. The space between another fic in which Chara and Frisk have a conversation. Quality May feel a little out of character depending on your headcanons but a fairly good read anyway. The place I stop and you begin similar in concept to my favorite up there. Quality Ehhh. Talk to me the fic you read when youve run out of fanfictions and youre absolutely desperate to read anything. Romance but nothing NSFW. Quality This is the absolute worst fic on the list read as a last resort only. Once you get through the others its pretty much either this or the one where Frisk smooches a ghost. Hopefully you dont end up craving Undertale stuff so badly that you have to come to this one.,Undertale,cvlohou,4,t5_2xdht

5288640,0,t3_3nfnxc,Ive played a fair number of bullet hell shooters so Ive got a few tips.First minimise your movement. If youre moving across the whole screen to dodge a bullet youre moving into the paths of bullets you didnt even have to think about before. Second learn to recognise bullets which are targeted directly at you. Toriels hand attack is an example of this the fireballs will fly straight at you. A small movement perpendicular to the direction the bullets are coming from is enough to dodge all of them.Thirdly dont think about it as dodging bullets. This probably sounds counterintuitive but stick with me. There are so many bullets on screen that if youre focusing on getting out of their way youre keeping track of way too much stuff and youre gonna screw up. Instead focus on the gaps. Try to hit those and move through them. Navigate a path through the gaps in the bullets. Suddenly youre focused on one thing instead of a hundred and youll have a much easier time keeping up.Finally dont give up! Bullet hell games are hard theres a reason they have hell in the name. But youll get the hang of it and youll get better. And if a boss really gets too much you can always grind gold by sparing random encounters until you can fill your inventory with the best healing items you can buy.,Undertale,cvnopow,3,t5_2xdht

5292536,0,t3_3nhmgk,Bear in mind almost none of the monsters know you are even human they just think youre a weird monster if anything. Many of the fights start with hopped near or wanders by or similar. Most of them arent really attacking you per se. Theres a handful that are truly violent but pacifist doesnt always mean that its mutual the game also touches on forgiveness and second chances patience in the face of impatience. Just because a monster is angry or upset or aggressive doesnt mean you have to kill them. Empathy and all that.If you dont shoot metatons heart at all his limbs blow off anyway because hes flailing and dancing around like a total maniac.,Undertale,cvo6lqc,12,t5_2xdht

5319212,0,t3_3nubh9,I felt the neutral ending leads to a different kind of determination especially if youve spared every monster before then. Right at the beginning you ask Toriel how to get out of the ruins and how to get home. All the monsters you befriend support your journey but have no reason to believe it would involve the death of their leader and king since the beginning of monster history. You continue forward wondering about Alphyss knowledge of killing Asgore and if his life is worth taking for yours. Does her information make you determined to spare the king after your long journey of meeting all sorts of monsters? Or does your determination to return to your human world win overall? Unlike True Pacifist theres no middle ground here either you die and the monsters are free or you live and the king dies unless you plan never to meet the king or go to True Lab and complete the game.I also like thinking about the motivations of the  souls they dont know you yet they save you from Floweys onslaught again and again. Is it because they care about you a human child theyve never met? Or is it because they want freedom due to all the years of confinement in Asgores castle? Or maybe they just hate Flowey and monsters killing and using them? So many thoughts about this great game!,Undertale,cvrlb20,7,t5_2xdht

5326998,0,t3_3nzgep,Massive SPOILERS Chara was deranged entering the underground. Flowey makes reference right from the beginning of the genocide run after Toriel. Chara is the one who killed Asriel and inadvertently created Flowey. She yes Flowey refers to her as a She kills herself only to spite a child then only to take over the childs body. If Asriel didnt stop Chara when he was above ground no timeline would exist. Chara is a monster in a moral sense and equates to an evil mastermind. This was all before we had an influence on the gameworld.Unless we are missing something in her story.,Undertale,cvsl3fb,1,t5_2xdht
5329417,0,t1_cvb2vxe,Sorry for the late reply but are you aware that your theory doesnt explain any of the following facts that the game clearly states? It just explains a couple of things that arent even mentioned in the game like why Toriel doesnt recognize you which can also be explained by OPs theory.The key facts we have to consider here are the following Toriel carried Charas corpse from its coffin to the beginning of the game to fulfill monsters ritual for the death ones saving the fact that a human corpse wouldnt turn into dust and thats the key. There isnt a single cutscene actually showing Frisks body. All of them are Charas ones. Thats why we start controlling Charas body in the place Toriel left it there is also nothing stating that Asriel left Charas body on the surface after he was attacked by humans which makes it very plausible that he took it back into the underground. This character starts the game with the same bandages that Charas corpse had in its coffin and also if you dont unequip them through the whole game Sans will make a comment regarding them when its judgement time. Again the only explanation is that were playing with Charas body. Flowey mentions that Chara is in possesion of a stolen soul. That can only mean that Frisks soul is into Charas body its the soul what has been stolen not the body. Since humans cant absorb other souls its not possible that there are  souls into the characters body in case you thought about that.To sum it up just as OP said the theory that we the actual players are Frisk and our soul gets embedded into Charas corpse actually explains everything.,Undertale,cvsw6sh,1,t5_2xdht
5330803,0,t1_cvsslml,Im not sure how much you care but I dont think Frisk wears short pants.I have  reasons for this.First off is the intro sequence. On the last page you can see Chara on the floor and theyre wearing long pants. Its no secret that Chara and Frisk pretty much share the same sprite implying that they have the same type of clothing.Second off if you would look at the only other kid with arms that has a full sprite which is Asriel you can see that he too is wearing long pants. And in his overworld sprite with his big feet it looks as if he has short shorts as well.Im not sure if theres an official description of him anywhere that the wiki got it from or if it was just speculation on the writers part but these are my  cents.I also wish you good luck in getting this outfit together!,Undertale,cvt2j3e,1,t5_2xdht

5337073,0,t1_cvtl747,One thank you.  I appreciate you taking the time to write out such a thoughtful reply.And I agree I do think you shouldnt want to fight him and feel bad while doing so.  I just dont think that has to be exclusive to feeling the NEED to fight him.  You can feel like it is the necessary thing to do while at the same time regret it at every stage.  My qualm was that the game brought about the need by literally giving you no other options to progress rather than giving you enough motivation otherwise.Yes Alphys said you would have to take his soul if you wanted to cross the barrier and it was made clear that he needed yours to do one better and free the monsters.  That only one of you would make it out of the encounter.  Maybe Im different or I just had the opposite response but none of that felt like a REASON to fight only an EXCUSE.  Im not suggesting that ASGORE should have been pained in a light that makes you WANT to fight him never but the way he was portrayed before the fight his mannerisms and personality screamed that he should have been able to be talked down.  Sure you can rationalize his actions in hindsight and say he was resolute and that he had to but that wasnt conveyed.Thats why it left me with a disconnect.  For me The fight command never felt like the reluctant but necessary answer it should have been.  I had literally almost stopped playing at his encounter after a few days there because I was so invested that my Frisk didnt believe in fighting to be the solution.I only edited because my friends didnt want me to stop there but I refused to fight him.  I still think of that point as the true end of my game.That Frisk would keep trying and eventually hundreds of thousands of deaths later ASGORE would listen.,Undertale,cvtvcaj,0,t5_2xdht

This is just a pet theory that spawned with the realization that Asriels Chaos blasterbuster Omega Floweys mouth blast and Sans Gaster blasters are similar coupled with the fact that Sans is meta aware and sabotages your interface directly in his battle. What if Gasters experiments accidentally turned Sans the hardest boss in the game and yet not a Boss Monster into a very weak demigod?

5564798,0,t3_3rch7f,Thats because Toriel is weak. And I dont mean that in the sense that she doesnt have power. I mean it in the sense that she cant bear to use it. When the first human and her son died Asgore snapped wanting revenge and freedom. Hed declare war on the disgusting creatures that would harm his sons. The monsters all of which are highly sympathetic to their king and his children are absolutely on board obvously. Freedom finally justice and revenge for Asgore. Toriel knowing how terrible that is turns her back. Maybe she thinks that Asgores love for her is enough to stop those terrible plans and... hell it probably would be if he had had any time to grieve. When it comes down to it Toriel and Asgore are both that way. They dont really want to harm anyone they just want a family and settle down. When the humans come to the underground and Toriel finds them she does her best to protect them and give them a home but everyone just wants to leave. With the player being the last one way or another. It makes her angry enough to lash out but not angry enough to kill. Im fairly sure Toriel wouldnt use her powers to intervene even if she was strong enough  and I do peg Asgore a fair bit above her in any case. Hell  in one of the endings Undyne dethroned her forcibly and we know that Asgore is stronger than her. I dont think Toriels actions are rational. I think shes afraid of seeing others get hurt and even if she hates Asgores decision I dont think she hates him. ,Undertale,cwmv3pz,18,t5_2xdht

I think Undertale is a testament to how storytelling influences the lives of the ones who reads or in this case plays a great work of litterature. Theres so many areas to use and the only option to cover all the powerful aspects of this game the world itself its characters the music will require far more than just  pages. I hope I can pull it off.

Unless we alter time somehow by SAVING or through a time machine this is currently the final timeline. If people have time traveled to the past to mess things up it already has happened.To put it short those other humans couldnt save and if they could they might of lacked the ability to fully use SAVE. Maybe they could go back whenever they wanted but when they died they died.Then again this is just a theory.P.S. be as critical as you want about this theory since I honestly do have a hard time forming my thoughts into paper and especially when it comes to thoughts into speech I may have made this look like gibberish by complete accident so sorry.,Undertale,cwsn9jp,1,t5_2xdht

The people complaining saying the fandom is bad dont mean impoliteness they just mean they find the volume and extremity at which the game is praised and referenced annoying. The same thing happened with the homestuck fandom.No encouraging people to be polite isnt a bad thing but as I said doing something like this isnt going to help with that. If you see someone being impolite then you should confront them directly. Chances are even that wont help cuz the sort of person whos going to be impolite arent going to care but at least its more likely to work then this post. and for the record for the most part everyone on here are reasonable to talk to.My point of it being stupid is simply its a futile post to make. It wont effect anyone who actually is problematics actions and seems to be entirely about shaming people for being harmless and getting passionate about undertale cuz they are the only sort of person who are gunna see this and think maybe this means me maybe I should stop typing as temmie everywhereputting youre gunna have a bad time on everything mildly related to undertaleYeah that sort of constant referencing can be annoying but its harmless and shouldnt reflect badly on the game especially since many of the people who criticize the fandom for shit like this probably do the same sort of thing within fandoms they ARE part of,Undertale,cwsy2go,2,t5_2xdht

5675780,0,t1_cx0l18y,Well heres where things are less solidBecause Floweys plans backfired didnt they? Absorbing all of the souls led to him growing emotion again and thus the true pacifist ending was possible. So you could say that Flowey manipulated Papyrus but Papyrus could have easily just allowed Flowey to manipulate him because he knew the ultimate outcome would be positive. So whos manipulating who? Obviously just a possibility mind you.On that vein I think the most telling thing about Papyrus is in fact his advice for you to go to Alphys lab. The way he tells you to I FEEL STRONGLY AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON. YOU SHOULD GO... THERE. TO HER LAB... HOUSEThe fact that Papyrus directs you to her Lab before correcting his statement it seems that Papyrus knew about Alphys lab himself not forced by Flowey. After all Papyrus never speaks to you like that and Flowey had never coerced Papyrus to do things for him so it makes little sense that Papyrus would put on such a suspicious and uncharacteristic discussion because of Flowey. As in if Flowey would have coerced Papyrus to the point where he would act so suspiciously it would be when he gathered everyone in front of the Barrier to stop Asgore.And finally Sans is aware of Flowey. How does Sans learn of this? Maybe Papyrus keeps Sans filled in and they decided to keep an eye on Flowey and when you arrive they have two strange creatures to keep an eye on.,Undertale,cx0mx8k,3,t5_2xdht

I dont have anything about the Wrong Number Call thing but I still think its a crucial part of the theory since Alphys on entry  or something talks about what you two think about a blueprint Possibly Gasters Its possible that he quit the trying to save Gastro because he CANT GO BACK since he broke the machine. I do agree however about being able to stop time momentarily. I stand by everything still with the theory about the machine that it broke from overheating machines do that kind of thing. ,Undertale,cx0qwt3,1,t5_2xdht

The difference in starting out as a pacifist however is that there are two choices to make from there if one decides to go for the true ending next.ampnbsp You either reset completely and proceed to do exactly the same thing a second time... or you reload your save right before Asgore fight and go back to progress with the hidden event.ampnbspThat is how I played it and I think it actually... kind of ended my experience with this game too abruptly  which is why Ive felt it might have been for the best to begin from the start without my first run being pacifist... so that I would get to play the game again without necessarily doing things exactly the same way.ampnbspNeedless to say Im somewhat reluctant to reset now.,Undertale,cx2cj04,1,t5_2xdht

In that situation there is no way to avoid damage.However should that situation not arise it is  doable. not counting the end bit.

Mad dummy also demonstrates the ability to use his turn to filibuster. Undyne attacks first via overworld hits. Undyne The Undyings upward spear attack persists briefly into your turn and can hit you when her turn ends if youre in the wrong place. Technically all characters and objects arbitrarily change location when not onscreen in a way that corresponds to where they were going or were if not going somewhere rather than actually traversing the distance. Hypothetically possible to use this to wrongwarp. Some projectiles do not disappear when you hit them. Green attacks do not trigger invincibility frames. Player defense cannot push damage below . Papyrus does the gravity thing. Papyrus also can deal nonlethal damage damage that cant take away your last HP The Gaster blaster was presumably made by Gaster. May or may not have actually been based on the DT Extraction machine. Characters who are ready to be spared can be killed in one hit.The only trick Sans pulls that I cant source from somewhere else is his KR damageovertime ability.

Alphys could have made one last desperate stand by reviving the fallen and pushing the amalgamates into action against you which would become one giant monstrosity with the power of many monster souls and determination.  Maybe even with a goal not of killing you but simply trapping you in the underworld as they all find a way to flee for the surface and lock you back in the barrier.I think the ending was perfect as is but this would be a pretty amazing avenue for escalation it probably crossed Tobys mind at some point.,Undertale,cx6txs4,4,t5_2xdht

5740110,0,t1_cx8l954,Thats what it says but the CHECK screen has been wrong before. If he had literally infinite ATK hed be doing infinite damage to you no matter how much he held back. Infinity is a number so high that infinity is still infinity. So is infinity or infinityinfinity and so on. So even if you deliberately hold back youd still do infinite damage. Basically if he did actually have infinite power he wouldnt even be able to control it. Also itd probably crash the game if it was even possible to get a computer to somehow manage infinity. Basically the screen just says infinity while the actual number is something high but still more realistically manageable. According to ripped data on the wiki his DEF is  while his ATK is only .The CHECK screen lies sometimes.,Undertale,cx8m7jr,6,t5_2xdht
5740984,0,t3_3trx5n,Yes!! He definitely was intentional! There are several really incriminating tweets that Toby made  that reference the time machine in Sans backroom. This is a BIG part of the Gaster theory because the Grey NPCs that appear and tell you his story make reference to the fact that he was working on something when he was pushed into a machine and scattered across time and space.There are many quantum physics references.Its like the most metameta thing ever. You can only access Gaster BECAUSE hes in the code. Because he fell into the code and was scattered. There are bits of him in the pixel art Sans Gaster Blaster and the audio files like Gasters theme as well as Sans battle theme which would only play in a potential alternate universe where you fight him in a neutralpacifist run.Theres not to mention the River Lady who says Beware of the man who speaks with hands widely speculated to refer to Gaster because of the reference to Wing Ding font.Really dude it goes on. I strongly believe its just Tobys genius.,Undertale,cx8q3ta,1,t5_2xdht

In the end I lost it and sent the ones who hurt him to the hospital each in as bad or worse condition than what my little brother had suffered. Im a nice and peaceful person most of the time.

She could have done the same suggestion but I think the same thing that stopped Asgore could have stopped her  not so much cowardice as not wanting to kill more humans or repeat Asriels tragedy. Knowing how much they had loved Chara a human child Im not sure they could have mustered the killing intent to harvest more souls if theyd gone to the surface with one or more human soul. AsrielChara wasnt invincible except when he had six souls  all monster souls and even then couldnt overcome a single humans determination and they wouldnt be either without the will to kill they would have just died too.,Undertale,cxid2pn,2,t5_2xdht

5842011,0,t1_cxl9r98,I keep forgetting about that scene with Toriel. Hm.I think that if all the human souls had the same determination level as Frisk none of them would have died. What may have happened is that each human by virtue of a humans base level determination was able to harness the power of saveloadreset but they lacked the mentalemotional fortitude to die over and over again and eventually just gave in.By contrast Frisk has at least double the determination of a normal person because her soul trait is also determination.

5842139,0,t3_3v927z,I think were just asked to suspend our disbelief on this one.If I had to guess though its likely an embellishment on the part of monster history but perhaps more of an educated guess because they figured it was something Asriel kindhearted as he was would probably do. They speak of him not just as the king and queens son but as the benevolent prince the Undergrounds beacon of hope a tragic figure who died upholding the kindness his people were known for. They believe his only purpose in gaining such devastating power would be to use it to fulfill his best friends dying wish because thats who Asriel was to them  not a timid child easily coerced to violence by his troubled sibling but a martyr who held to his convictions.Its said that monster souls are by their nature filled with love. Would it not make sense then for someone embodying those ideals so faithfully to stay true to them even when faced with certain death? I dont think we could know the true story. But then maybe were not supposed to. By the time we arrive Asriels place in legend is more symbolic.,Undertale,cxlfiyj,5,t5_2xdht

None of the other monsters seemed to think that Chara was evil or troubled so they likely didnt act out.But its also possible that they hid their malice.

5877949,0,t1_cxq1e07,A good thing to remember about the batters character is that hes not a completely mindless killing machine.  He only purifies those he sees as adversaries.  For example when he first arrives in zone  to the smoke mines he only says that he is there to purify the world.  He only starts taking of purifying the world by destroying the spectres as soon as the elsen mention having problems with spectres.He also gets annoyed fairly quickly if things get in the way of his mission.  Such as evidenced by his vaguely annoyed reactions to the spectre chief not being in the auxiliary tunnel and only responding that panic in Ballville was stupid.He is also extremely terse.  Everything he says is directly to the point unless under stress or a surprising situation.  Despite this he still uses a wide vocabulary.He generally wont speak unless asked a question or already participating in by a conversation.He is EXTREMELY confident that he is the hero in his mission.  He constantly refers to his missions as sacred and also says such things as from now on there will be no more darkness.  Which is all a bit ironic considering he is literally destroying the entire existence of the game world and that theres neither going to be light or darkness.,Undertale,cxq4q8e,36,t5_2xdht

Im just trying to point out that the difference between canon and fanon is that even if theres a preponderance of evidence pointing to something being true its STILL not canon unless it is stated in the game. The problem I have with the Gaster thing as a whole is that it has led to people declaring suppositions and hunches as fact rather than theory and that kind of misinformation can confuse people new to to the fandom or character and create a situation where everyone is parroting the same suppositions as truth because if everyones saying it then it must be canon.,Undertale,cya2ca8,3,t5_2xdht

6036226,0,t3_3y65fh, This really comes down to how much of a person do you think needs to be there in order for it to still count as the same being? Monster funerals involve spreading dust on someones favorite things so some of their essence will live on through them. Floweys got Asriels memories and personality  thats enough for me IMO. He knows fighting Frisk with six souls isnt going to work by that point. I guess hes familiar enough with monsters natures that hes counting on everyones hearts being united enough to take their souls? Sanss aim with the fight is to make you  the player  want to give up and reset. Asriel talks about it a little too  every time you die I can feel your grip on this world slipping away. The more you die the more frustrated youll naturally get with a game. I dont actually have anything to say here but it felt strange to leave the number out A soul isnt required to SAVE and Flowey can always do so from the moment of his creation. Theres actually a lot of discussion about this in the murder run if you missed it in New Home. Its not til Frisk falls that he loses it. Floweys literally just a flower with a big dose of the thing that allows saving i.e. determination when it comes down to it.,Undertale,cyav2xc,2,t5_2xdht

If that human was able to overload his save with his determination he wouldnt have problem of getting out of there like Frisk Dont you think?. Why would Flowey try to see souls that Asgore has?

The original joke while not laughoutloud funny was was not bad meanspirited or irrelevant enough to be downvoted let alone to this degree.  It could have been told more clearly yes but even if someone mistook it for a legitimate question then downvoting is not the way to deal with that either.As for the second comment yes it could have been worded a bit more tactfully but neither was it meanspirited.  No attacks were made on the posts OP it was not worded because youpeople are too stupid to get it.  Jokes go over all of our heads sometimes and thats okay Im not saying that that was or wasnt the case here merely that in similar situations it isnt bad either..I dont find it terribly unlikely that utechniqucian would not have been downvoted had they merely said whoosh or even if the first person had not started the trend because this is simply an undeserved whim of chance.Please be kind.,Undertale,cyjaujf,5,t5_2xdht

6141922,0,t1_cyncrue,Im glad you like it. I hope Im able to do it justice. As uBadTimeSkeleton points out theres potential for narm here so Ill have to take care to avoid it.I agree that the genocide route is not meant to be rewarding or satisfying in the traditional sense. That being said there is something rewarding about it in a depraved way that I feel is very intentional. Ironically its the very feeling of emptiness you describe. An emptiness that you brought about. It makes you feel powerful. By changing your own behavior youre able to change the way everyone else behaves and force them to generate new content for you through their suffering.Regardless of which route you take whats truly immersive about Undertale is that it offers you the power of choice but it truly feels like you have to be determined to exercise it. Because whatever choice you make the game opposes it. In pacifist and neutral everyones trying to kill you. The game is trying to provoke you to fight back. On the other hand if you try genocide the game gives you every opportunity to turn it around.Thats an element I want to preserve in my piece opposing the games will until with enough skill and perseverance youre able to break it and then enjoying watching it break down and fall apart.It sounds sadistic but if you think about it its how you end true pacifist too you take an unstable character who represents the will of the whole game working against you and slowly urge him through a mental breakdown. The only difference is that with Asriel theres light at the end of the tunnel because youre killing him with kindness. By the time Im done with Chara theyll just be an incoherent lump of pain.,Undertale,cynrtd7,2,t5_2xdht

6154396,0,t3_3zuexa,I dont know why you feel bad about it especially if you reset and do the TPR route again with slight challenges. Essentially you dont do anything wrong.The following goes slightly offtopic Well for example I had my hopes that you actually can save someone special at the end of the game if you do a specific set of actions such as but not limited to  normal  resetting the game after exhausting his dialogue at the ruins which doesnt do anything the game treats you as if youve done a reset after the neutral ending talking to npcs in a specific order or ignoring them  using DREAM near him or any other items dropping these items etc. Why did I even bother trying? Pre credits TPR main menu screen has that gap between Asgore and the monster kid in which you can fit  kid sprites... Plus it feels rather strange that Friskspoiler a person the determination of which was strong enough to save almost everyone through all the pain and misunderstanding didnt do anything to save the last one even though its apparent it might be possible through what the game offers us as knowledge  that weird main menu screen of pre tpr ending.So again dont be afraid to true reset imagine it as if...you reset yourself too you dont remember what happened before and just live through the journey again if that helps.,Undertale,cyp6vcv,2,t5_2xdht

6159083,0,t3_3zx62o,I didnt expect the game to be any bigger than it was.If this were another RPG Id maybe expect things like recurring bosses a bigger world to explore meeting the ELITE SQUAD that is the royal guard in epic conflict. But the royal guard at most is the dogs and Undyne. So we did meet them all.But beyond that this world was honestly as big as I expected it to be. It was well paced it didnt seem to slam an end in my face when I wasnt expecting it. It didnt slam an end in my face in general. Again it felt controlled well paced exactly what I expected it to be and what it needed to be.Most of the time from other RPGs when I see that kinda stuff where you fight the same guys over and over and you have this whole mystery that they just hold behind their back prolonging the obvious it just feels like fluff. Like theyre just padding the game time for the sake of giving more character time. But like just make sure the story and game fits giving the characters enough time to exist with out pointless diversion.Thats why I felt like it worked because I got what I needed to understand from each character then when I wanted more it was there too. From dialog to the overworld sections to the battles each character was given time to be a character and to be what they needed to be. I didnt feel like a character was under developed or sidelined.So I didnt think this game was going to be bigger nor did I expect it to be. If you want more the world lets you dig with out too much backtracking. It even has a boat for fast travel.,Undertale,cypq2u6,4,t5_2xdht

6164711,0,t3_3zu5er,I have a few ideasA You gotta think about the lore in the game. Back during the war humans fought the monsters into Mt. Ebott with swords and magic so were probably looking at a medieval timeline here right? Back in those days someone could kill someone else for looking at them funny and the rest of society wouldnt care so I can see the extreme actions that were taken when the entire race could be destroyed by  monster. But thats not the mindset in our current era. If someone kills someone else in this day and age theyre labelled as morally wrong and in extreme cases killed themselves. Weve kinda went from an extreme aggression to a more passive live and let live attitude. So outright killing all the monsters is probably off the table.B Without outright running into the middle of town and screaming that theyre monsters and start blowing things up people would probably think you were a tourist in cosplay or something. Think about. If you were in a cafe drinking some coffee or something and you saw papyrus running through the streets shaking everyones hand and introducing himself would your first thought be damn thats a spoopyass skeleton man better call the cops so we can hunt down their entire race and murder them all. Probably not right? And before you say but hes literally a walking talking skeleton cant cosplay that without obviously being in a suit you have to remember that this is a universe with magic right? Someone could easily just use magic to make some fake bones move around or something of that ilk right? So worst off you might think its weird but thats it. C They probably got frisk to go into town by themselves to warn who evers in charge about what happened and to ease the people into accepting the monsters. Probably laid down some negotiations with Asgore privately or something. I doubt the monsters would be inclined to run into town all willynilly anyways. We kinda slaughtered most of them last time we met.Sorry Im a bit late to the discussion lt,Undertale,cyqd4oi,2,t5_2xdht

6177926,0,t1_cyrhetz,I holehardedly agree but allow me to play doubles advocate here for a moment. For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of preMadonnas but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words when you get down to brass stacks it doesnt take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. Its clear who makes the pants in this relationship and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mothers mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like its a peach of cake.,Undertale,cyrv6po,1,t5_2xdht

6192149,0,t3_40dspp,Have you finished or spoiled for yourself the pacifist ending and the rest of the genocide ending? If the answer is no stop reading this now. Undertale is very much a storybased game and you really dont want to spoil the story for yourself. If the answer is yes then read ahead.im spoilering the entire explanation just to make sure I dont spoil anything for anyone by accidentSo if youve completed or spoiled the pacifist run for yourself then youve completed New Home the True Lab and the final boss battle and know that Flowey is the same person as Asriel Dreemurr. You know that Asriel and Chara grew up as friends and that ultimately Chara hatched a plan supposedly to free monsterkind once and for all Chara would lethally poison himself Asriel would absorb his soul as he died and then they would cross the barrier take six more human souls and destroy the barrier once and for all but when Chara urged Asriel to kill the humans attacking them and steal their souls Asriel refused leading to their death. You also know from Asriels dialogue at the end of the pacifist boss battle and afterwards that he mistook you Frisk for Chara. We see him do this in genocide toospoilergtYoure Chara right?spoilergtWere still inseperable after all these years...spoilerHe then proposes that together you could totally destroy the Underground in the ultimate demonstration of kill or be killedspoilergtHey thats a wonderful idea!spoilerTheres something to take away here Flowey may be talking a lot about kill or be killed but hes not really practicing what he preaches. Yes he tried to kill you but now that hes convinced youre Chara he wants you to join him in his quest for world domination.spoilerThis doesnt mesh with kill or be killed. By his own logic he should simply resume trying to kill you but instead he wants you to stay with him. And thats because no matter how twisted and demented and soulless Flowey is theres still some Asriel in him deep down and Asriel loved Chara. We see this in genocide when Flowey explains how he learned he could save and loadspoilergtBut I decided... it wasnt worth living anymore.spoilergtNot in a world without love.spoilergtNot in a world without you.spoilerAnd we see it even more clearly as Asriel explains why he wants to reset everything in the final pacifist battlespoilergtIm doing this because I care about you Chara! I care about you more than anybody else!spoilergtIm not ready for this to end. Im not ready for you to leave. Im not ready to say goodbye to someone like you again...spoilerIn summary Flowey still loves Chara very much and many of his actions are nothing more than attempts to get Chara back. Flowey assumes that these feelings are mutual and seeking to rekindle their old friendship which he would kill himself and everything else in the Underground to have back lets you live when according to his own philosophy he should simply kill you.spoilerNow lets look at Floweys dialogue just before he becomes scared of youspoilergtCreatures like us...spoilergtWouldnt hesitate to KILL each other if we got in each others way.spoilergtSo thats...spoilergtSo... thats... why...spoilerNow remember what the final moments Asriel and Chara shared before their deaths were Chara is urging Asriel to fight back to kill their attackers and take their souls to carry out the plan and Asriel is steadfastly refusing. At the end of a genocide run Chara describes his interpretation of events bluntlyspoilergtOur plan had failed hadnt it?spoilerSee Flowey had assumed that his love for Chara would be reciprocated by Chara that they would still be best friends. But suddenly Flowey realizes that maybe Chara doesnt love him any more. He suddenly comes to the realization that Chara might have viewed his refusal to destroy their attackers all those years ago as him getting in Charas way and of course Chara wouldnt hesitate to kill Flowey if he got in Charas way right?spoilerSuddenly Flowey realizes his best friend is now a massively powerful serial killer who legitimately believes that its kill or be killed and who wont let any nostalgia get in the way of this doctrine and that they might very well be out to kill him as revenge.spoilerThis fear of course leads to him running away and then desperately murdering Asgore in front of you as a final attempt to convince you to spare him because hes still useful crying in fearspoilergtSee? I never betrayed you! It was all a trick see? I was waiting to kill him for you!spoilergtAfter all its me your best friend! Im helpful I can be useful I promise I wont get in your way I can help...spoilergtI can...spoilergtI can...spoilergtPlease dont kill me.spoilerFloweys fears are then validated at this point because its no longer you controlling Frisk its Chara and Chara doesnt just murder his best friend and adoptive brother they mutilate him. After all its kill or be killed right?spoilertldr Flowey suddenly realizes that Chara might want to kill him as revenge for his refusal as Asriel to carry out Charas plan and that Chara unlike him wont make any exceptions to the kill or be killed doctrine.spoiler,Undertale,cythd7g,1,t5_2xdht

But I think considering this is all one attack its gonna take a while to do  more. Even when I do all of the attacks theres still the players turn which includes trying to make the FIGHT system creating all of the ACT options and setting up the correct order creating the ITEM system and finally MERCY which actually wont require that much work once the ACT system is done.

6251966,0,t3_417rvl,You could have multiple copies of Undertale and you could have multiple Steam accounts. No matter what they share from the same save folder location if youre on the same computer. If you wanted to start up a fresh file you would need to do one of the following things. Remove the existing files from the Undertale save folder. You can remove and insert save files in this manner in order to keep multiple saves. Have multiple computer user accounts on the same computer and switch between them. They use different save folder locations. Use a different computer.And even then the Steam Cloud will store one of the Genocide completion files systeminformation. This will upload to any computer you play Undertale on making computer switching ineffective. But its pretty easy to avoid the consequences of this. By continuing the Genocide path to the very end systeminformation will eventually get replaced by systeminformation. Steam no longer stores systeminformation according to more recent reports. So all you would have to do is delete systeminformation when the time comes and youll be consequencefree. And if Steam still uploads this file there are listed fixes for removing this data from the Steam Cloud.,Undertale,cz0a4rw,2,t5_2xdht

6259191,0,t1_cz12mg4,Well then it seems youre judging it based on how many times someone was referenced in the playable game. Sans overall plot relevance is quite small compared to Asriels. Sans guides you through snowdin but doesnt do much beyond that. It is never clearly explained how he got his powers or knowledge. It is also unclear whether he even dies in the genocide run or why he bleeds after you attack himspoiler. Hell why does Sans wait until the very last moment in a genocide run to try and stop you? Wouldnt it be a whole lot more logical if you a powerful being tried to stop a villain after they spurred a massive evacuation? If you ask me Sans role was very shoehorned.Asriel on the other hand set in motion almost the entire story of Undertale by stopping Charas actions way back in the games history and dyingspoiler. Hell as Flowey he stalks you throughout the entire game and even directly assists you in certain moments in the genocide runspoiler.You may not like the way the pacifist ending was done and I can see why.

6267464,0,t3_41dy0c,Well if you ever need more help Id be glad too! As long as you have ideas Ill help with refinement. Chara is a slippery snail huh? Well I definitely say at least back for obvious reasons. The only reason I put white was because of her contract with the player. Green is definitely out for sure leaving Blue and Red. Red makes sense as a color that implies violence so thats a maybe. But blue could also work as a maybe since Chara had a plan for a long while. Its funny that you mention Akroan Mastiff since that card is literally what I was picturing! The thing is though that Akroan Mastiff just raps for that turn while Papyrus is for both turns. But how about that for Papyrus? Since Papyrus is always wanting to make friends how about a repeatable pacifism effect? Something like W Place a pasta counter on target creature. Creatures with a pasta counter cannot attack or block. That creatures controller may remove one pasta counter per turn on their upkeep. ,Undertale,cz21hih,2,t5_2xdht

Science?? Idk. plus Sans and Papyrus are brothers and have the same magic blue heart bones and yet somehow only Sans has the ability to use shortcuts which I always thought might have something to do with resets and timeline manipulation but it could just as much be just another magic ability like his blasters that papyrus doesnt have for whatever reason.But yeah he definitely doesnt remember resets or anything like what the fandom has pretty much accepted as true because otherwise he would be able to as you said remember you reseting in the hall to give the passwords. While hes good at reading faces and emotions and possibly has an outside source that can at least view timelines somehow hes not flowey.

Asriel hints that Chara already tried to commit suicide once before by jumping down the mountain. Did Chara really not feel any remorse at all for hurting the person that adopted them? I highly doubt that Chara knew what would happen to Asriel once the soul was absorbed.gtOnce Asriel crossed Charas soul intended to take over Asriel and kill all the humans in the village.and failed at that. How was it that a monsters determination overrode that of a human?gtCharas death was just a plan to kill all the humans in the village.I see it as an incredibly disturbed child that committed suicide and had absolutely no knowledge of what would happen afterIf Chara really had the determination to kill then I feel that Undertale wouldve ended a lot sooner.,Undertale,cz70cws,6,t5_2xdht
6311702,0,t3_422f6o,well the entire point of the genocide route is to make you feel like shit. youre taking these characters that most people related to resonated with and absolutely love...and youre killing them. you make friends with them make them happy and then you spit in their faces and kill em all. one of the reasons i regret going full pacifist the first time but eh thats what fanfic is for.but it doesnt want you to. it begs you not to. pleads with you. sans who seems to have the most meta knowledge spends a lot of effort trying to placate you right up until he bsods after you kill papyrus.now people will tell you that its worth it for the story its worth it for the experience and its worth it because you put out  on it. but if it makes you feel like shit its doing its job correctly. if youre still interested you can join the ranks of us sickos who watched someone on youtube do it. besides the megalovania fight is a real pain in the ass from what ive heard. i dont have that kind of determination. if you do along with the desire still pick it back up and go for it. dont let me tell you what to do.,Undertale,cz72j7j,3,t5_2xdht

6323354,0,t3_4269nw,Nice write up. I actually agree with many of your points though I have a few others to add if you dont mind.I do think that Chara saw his sacrifice as a winwin for both himself and monsters. From what little we know about Chara he hated humanity and attempted suicide or did he? Maybe he was fleeing pursuers and fell in.... I speculate that Chara hated his own humanself as well.So heres the problem Chara seesgt Humans trapped monstersgt They need a human soul to get outgt Toriel and Asgore are too soft hearted to do anything about itgt If hes absorbed by Asriel not only can Asriel free all monsters but Chara will cease to be human and in a sense be a monster like his familyChara saw his sacrifice as really the ONLY option to save monsters and he was happy to do it because he loved his family and already had a death wish.Another thing I hear cited as a reason Chara is evil is because he laughed off poisoning Asgore. This is pretty damning but hear me out. I think Chara had been plotting his sacrifice for some time but was stuck on HOW he was going to die. He couldnt ask Asriel to do it and other methods of suicide are messydifficultscary etc. He also had to make sure he didnt get caught and saved by his parents.But when he realizes that Asgore could die from a simple flower he has this Aha moment and laughs. The solution was here in plain sight the whole time! Its creepy and inappropriate and it sounds cruel but Chara wasnt thinking about Asgore he was thinking about the bigger picture.I will not deny that Chara was a messed up kid. I think they were tormented manipulative and fatalistic. But I dont think they were EVIL at least not while they were alive. After all the road to hell is paved with good intentions.,Undertale,cz8ea09,1,t5_2xdht

I think it raises the question of why videogames have struggled so much to be recognized as art or as a legitimate storytelling medium and how giving its consumers more choice in how they consume it can work against this goal. When you give people an endgame whether that endgame is  or just completing a challenge like Sans the rest of the game is a path to that endgoal the story is pushed to the side and the characters become means to that end with no actual depth of their own other than what they can do to help you toward that goal e.g. giving you items opening up new paths or dying.I definitely agree with you on Alphys texts though and I feel the same way about Hotland that you do with Waterfall. The music was cool but honestly began to grate on me after its umpteenth loop and the bright orange started to burn into my retinas.

Undertale isnt the only community to have it but due to its current high popularity there is an unfortunate number of people who are going too far in unfortunate ways.Regardless opinion on what games are good or not tends to be personal opinion so even if you think other games are better for various reasons there are going to be lots of people who dont agree.

The junior jumble people claim the gibberish at the top tells you Gaster appears off the cliffside but FUN just adds a creepy snowmanSanss phone call I want to say obvious but its more likely the two characters are strongly related but that gives the actual call no real significance and Alphyss call She is Gasters replacement either his successor or literally replaces his emptied spot in the universe so everything stayed the same without him again that has nothing to do with the actual call.,Undertale,czeo6wu,3,t5_2xdht

You really think calling them out will help anybody out? If you want to make a good video make one comparing SMT and Undertale in deep to show how much better you may make the combat system. I played the first five games in the SMT and I know that it is a great series and I know that the battle system is amazing because that game was a dungeon crawler and it needed one for a selling point. That will be an interesting video. But calling people shit because their storydriven game has an unoriginal battle system that appeared in like  years old games is only going to bring out trolls. Most people in the fanbase do realize that the combat system has you cast friendship spells for a different kind of kills. Were not all retarded.Also Toby the author of the game is a known fan of the Megami Tensei franchise. The similarity of the combat system probably isnt incidental.,Undertale,czfq9uv,3,t5_2xdht

Dadster wasnt even the most common theory boyfriendster and brotherster are more common. Then postpatch theres the note in Sanss basement.. which could mean just about anything but most people take it as being evidence towards Dadster. But to be honest Ive seen more of Gaster being more of a creator than a real father. And to that I have seen more of him needlessly torturing the two in the interests of.. evil I guess than him being a legitimate scientist.

I think that they absolutely did bad things in life but I dont think that means they were totally evil.

6444959,0,t1_czlvip8,I was thinking about Asriels flaw and downfall is his enormous ability to love and be kind. In the end it makes him go through hell.  That isnt fair right? Why should he be condemned to a fate worse than death because he had faith and love in others? It tears me to pieces to think about it. What Flowey has to say after a pacifist neutral run is startling true Dont you realize that being kind just gets you hurt? For him its very true. The fact that he knows that and then goes through with still being kind after the Asriel fight really says something about Asriels character. From my own experiences being kind has hurt me very greatly. I still sometimes regret ever being kind. It was what caused me to be thrown into a suicidal depression. But it has done much good for me also. Be it nerdy as it is Asriels aptitude and example of love and kindness after the TPE keeps me inspired to keep being kind to others to keep from becoming cynical and indifferent again. Some days Im Flowey but others Im Asriel. Depression is a perpetual battle but as long as I keep kind and try to mimic Asriels love I think I can win.Sorry for going off on a tangent there just had to speak my mind.,Undertale,czly64s,4,t5_2xdht

6463485,0,t1_czndfne,Ok my third attempt....Being trapped for all eternity in this special hell that Flowey is in is hard. I get that but the fact of the matter is is he had a choice. He chose to kill and hurt people and he has fun doing it. You cant tell me its not for fun when you fight omega flowey and he saves over your death killing you over and over again. You cant say that when he himself explains how fun it is to kill people and hurt them. Flowey is a serial murderer making the world his play thing in the process. The game makes it very clear that it and its characters feel and whether they understand these feelings or not they make it clear that theyre not ok with this. At least Chara depite all his faults has the courtesy to just destoy everything in geno. He doesnt play with the world and make it his playground or mess with people for fun he just destroys it and leaves it at that even commenting on your perverted sense of sentimentality when you create and destroy the world over and over. So while Chara didnt live through multiple timelines when faced with the same choice he just destroyed the game. Theres no broken hopes and dreams or messing with peoples emotions there. I cant say what Id do in Floweys situation. I did my TP run and didnt touch my game since so theres that.Undertale does a very good job of creating parallels and making double meaningsinterpretations for certain aspects of the game. While you are insistant that Chara is evil I have to disagree. I simply do not see it. I truly believe the buttercup incident was an accident spurring the idea for their later suicide. As for laughing off poisoning Asgore I think its a little premature to jump to the conclusion of because theyre evil. Havent you ever done something accidentally and laugh it off before? Maybe you try to give your friend a highfive and hit them in the face maybe youre pushing your niece and on the swing and you accidentally push a little hard and she falls on her face or maybe you watch someone slip on some ice and fall and hurt themselves. Would you say you were evil or sadistic for laughing in these situations? I highly doubt it. These are real life examples for me that I laughed off. I am not a sadist nor did I enjoy anyones pain. It was a nervois reaction a normal reaction a lot of people have. I support this wtih the fact that the game shows how each child takes after each parent. Asriel takes after his dad being bad with names is a bit of a pushovercoward greets you with howdy. Chara greets you with Greetings just as Toriel does and has quite the vocabulary I assume Toriel instilled in them. He also cracks a few jokes some of them a little dark but if the Chara is narrator theory is true you see instances of nervous laughter just as Toriel does when you hurtkill her. Lets make it clear that Asriel was not tricked. He knew of the plan and is heard in one of the tapes saying I dont like this plan. He knew what was going on. He understood the plan from the beginning he was just scared to lose his friend but he still went through with it.Another point Id like to bring up is if destroying all of mankind was Charas intention from the start being that they shared body and mind I dont think he and Asriel wouldve made it past the barrier. He cant hide his thoughtsintentions from him. Plus it doesnt say that anywhere in the game from what I remember. Geno run is a separate case and shouldnt be mixed with this instance. He only wanted to harm this particular village AFTER they attack them first.I think Charas original intentions were good because Asriel shows they most likely wouldnt have gotten that far if they werent. Chara hated humanity and climbed the mountain for unhappy reasons. But he loved monsters. They showed him kindeness and compassion. He inspired hope among them and he was the future of monsters and humans. I dont think he took that lightly going so far as to sacrifice his life so that Asriel can cross the barrier and go out and get more souls to break the barrier. He was doing just as Toriel had said Asgore should and was too coward to do.  I think their original plan was to show how compassionate monsters were which is why he wanted Asriel to lay his body to rest in flowers. If the world saw monsters the way Chara did that would be really touching but the plan backfired and they were motally wounded. At this point humanityhis village had given no reason to disprove Charas views of humanity and he wanted to retaliate. I think if someone were killing me I would fight back. Granted what Chara was about to do was overkill but you said it yourself youd be a liar to say you wouldnt if you had that power yes?So while Chara isnt the greatest person that doesnt make them exemot from redemption or a little sympathy in the very least. Asriel states he wasnt the greatest person. And hes right in their final moments he didnt display the best morals. His determination to live his rage wouldve destroyed what he and Asriel were working to do. Had Asriel let Chara attack those people it would go down in history that monsters are evil and not to be trusted and Asriel saved them from that. When compared to Frisk Chara isnt the greatest person.But he isnt the worst. No one says that. Despite all of this everything thats happened Asriel sees something in them something that makes him go to extreme lengths to get their friend back going so far as to wanting to reset everything way back to before all of this. So much so he fights so hard to not lose you. If Chara were truly that bad a person I dont think Asriel would do the things he did in TP.In geno run despite being a killer Chara still shows his strong love for his adoptive family. When hes narrating in new home he comments on Asgore still having the Mr. King Dad Guy sweater he made him and flower drawing. When you equip the locket he says its right where it belongs and when you look at the picture of him together with his adoptive family he is overcome with emotion and cant even speak about it despite being a killer at this point.Doesnt that warrant some consideration and speak of Charas character? As I said before if I can show compassion and understanding to Flowey I can do the same to Chara. I feel he deserves and in deoth look into his character and not hes an asshole like everyone wants to label him.,Undertale,cznva8q,1,t5_2xdht

Of course the game says that even though humans can do this it has never happened before.  It also states however that humans cannot use magic.Logically this means either one of these claims is false or that the seven magicians were not actually human themselves.  After all if we know humans can absorb Boss Monster souls it seems logical that it must have happened at some point in history right?

Gaster will be referenced occasionally but hell never show up because for one thing his purpose here doesnt call for that and for another thing he has no canon personality or visage so that would be pretty dumb.Dont worry about the certain someone.

6656995,0,t3_46te04,Help for those that need it These wont be exact but they do give a general idea.st attack There is a VERY small safe spot between the left blue knife and the falling knives. Youll under and over shoot it a lot but it is far easier than manually dodging.spoilernd attack Wait a tiny bit for the first knife that falls Not the spinning one to appear. Immediately go left and hug the edge of the box. Go down and when you are a fairly small distance from the bottom edge go diagonally towards the bottom edge. Repeat for the rest going in a circle. Note that the spinning knife may occasionally get you while doing this. Sorry if this one isnt as good as my other description its kind of a hard attack to describe.spoilerrd and onward attacks These are in no determined order they are randomGiant Knives Hide in the lower right corner first then go to the lower left corner for the next two knives. Go back to the lower right for two more. Than go to the upper right for the next one. A knife will spawn above your box and fall so make sure you move instead of just standing there and taking it.spoilerBlue Knife Attack Blue knives will move across the box. Stand there and pay close attention to the rising knife. If it stays blue do nothing. If it changes orange immediately move.spoilerSpinning Knives Aplenty Similar to his second attack but has only vertically falling knives and  homing spinning knives. Simply move left and right while avoiding the spinning knives. Feel free to move up and around them too.spoilerMay use st attack again youll probably fuck up here.Because of that he might probably use his second as well but i havent seen it just a hunch.I believe thats all of them at least the ones I saw before ragequitting.

Its the reason why I avoided both sites up until a year or two ago but it comes down to where you look and what youre willing to overlook either way in addition to encouraging people on all sides not to be toxic asses just because they can.

6712894,0,t1_d0dn2hc,Thank you for the advice! Ive always had trouble with understanding how you get better with drawing because its always seemed like I never changed at all despite all the practice I do. Her bow was a little odd to draw and I feel like I could do a little bit more to make it look better. As much as I love it I think if I had more creativity I could do something better. With the sketchy lines I started drawing like that about a year ago and I seem to be stuck with it so I tried to work around it. Is there a way I could add in darker polished lines like in other pictures without having to do it by hand? My hands are rather shaky when drawing and I cant really fix it. Thanks for the advice and do you mind if I ask something of you? Id love to see another artists style of drawing so could you show me some of your work?

6720281,0,t1_d0edslc,Depends  for individuals with little empathy it takes very little wrath to drown it out. For emotionally healthy human beings the amount of wrath required to drown out empathy would typically leave them in a state of near incoherence.As for Chara specifically. Chara laughed off their accidental poisoning of Asgore  planned a premeditated murder spree then bullied and lied their adoptive brother into acting as an accomplice.This simultaneously demonstrates extremely low empathy for other living beings and very calculated premeditated planning. The only redeeming quality here may have been that Chara did this to protect her adoptive family but this is sadly conjecture. The thing that gets me is that even severe behavioral problems such as these can be treated and they rarely develop in a vacuum. Chances are that Chara was abused or neglected somehow before before being adopted and that these issues went entirely unnoticed in their home environment. Even if true however it doesnt excuse Chara.,Undertale,d0efodc,4,t5_2xdht
6722758,0,t1_d0eep4k,I disagree. x as we learn from the opening and examining the calendars in homenew home during genocide is when Chara fell Asgore and Toriel were of course still together at this point as they adopted Chara to care for alongside Asriel. It isnt until Chara and Asriels deaths that they finally split. re the opening note that the child shown falling in x has one stripe on their shirt like Chara not two like Frisk. We are then immediately asked to name the fallen human and we know were not naming Frisk therefore were naming the kid we just saw fall Chara.So lets say that Chara lands in .  We dont know how long passed between their arrival and their death could be a year or two or more. Every year theyre alive shortens the possible timeframe the  entire history of the game leading up to its start could have taken place in. And thats assuming that they fell at the start of x if they fell during  or  or  that would leave a ridiculously small span of time for many many things to happen. That seems implausible to me. Case in point the characters feeling young. I agree with you  on that which is why I pointed out that all of them were bornraised having never known Toriel queen. We know this from the ending where both Undyne and Alphys express shock and wonder at her arrival and question if thats his ex implying that they have never seen her before. Not all the monsters having encountered the six fallen humans is plausible but all the monsters not having seen their very public and outgoing rulers isnt especially given how relatively small the underground is. Which means that either Undyne et al were newborns when Toriel left or they didnt exist yet. Undyne growing up with Asgore is also significant as that would have required several years of time to train with himget to know him as well. Same with Alphys recent appointment as we learn from Gasters follower Gaster died some time ago and only recently  did Asgore decide to get a new Royal Scientist. And the first thing Alphys is appointed to do is the research that would lead to the amalgamates and Flowey. Since no more souls fall between Floweys birth and Frisks arrival we know that Alphys had all six souls at the time of her appointment. So enough time needed to have passed for that to transpire as well. And they are the oldest of the young monsters. Below them is a generation of teens ice cap and his contemporaries as suggested by the bear in Snowdin kids monster kid the rabbit shopkeepers son and infantsvery small children cinnamon bun. So thats at least four generations who have never known Toriel as queen.Less than a decade for all of that seems impossible unless monsters have some kind of souped up aging from child to adult like the Sims. Ultimately I suppose well have to agree to disagree. ,Undertale,d0eowc4,1,t5_2xdht

The human and Flowey I guess.Sans seems to have knowledge of them but he doesnt seem to use them I think? despite being pretty friggin determined to stop you in the Genocide timeline. Undyne also is so determined that she refuses the consequences of a fatal attack and comes back stronger than she ever was.I would think if determination was the key to SAVE both Sans and Undyne would be using them.Edit Actually maybe Sans does use SAVE given the way he does that black out attack and drops you into odd moments of the fight to catch you off guard. Im not sure if that counts given that when Flowey does it it shows text along the bottom.,Undertale,d0mpqcz,2,t5_2xdht

Seriously anything with slightly sexual connotations on this sub will receive a chain of FOREBODEN replies like its some sort of echo chamber. At this point its just a rush to see who gets the hot meme out first.

6863557,0,t3_49rnte,Toriels problem is that shes non confrontational to the fault. In every ending where you killed someone her make friends policy is so unpopular that she gets dethroned without a fight.  It seems like in any situation where she knows that shes the minority opinion she wont try to defend her idea or push for authority shell just walk away quietly and simmer.  This is especially reflected in how you spare her you just stand there for  minutes and she eventually deflates and leaves.  So she has good ideas she just cant stand up for herself for shit because shes so against fighting that she wont even use her massive amount of political physical and magical power to defend her opinions even though Asgore doesnt have much of a backbone himself!At this point I realize in my ramblings that monsters really do lack determination.

6932746,0,t1_d123l2e,I never said he was and no that wasnt the point I was trying to make. Theres a huge amount of missing information regarding the journeys and fates of the six humans. If you want to believe it was the same go to barrier get killed by Asgore I cant rightly say thats wrong. It is an awfully boring interpretation though.That doesnt go into the fact that to cross the barrier and leave they would have had to take either his or Toriels soul. Should he have just rolled over and died to let them pass? We see in multiple neutral endings except I guess the dog one???? that an underground not ruled by Asgore is even worse off and solves absolutely none of the monsters problems and in fact makes things even worse for humans eventually. And what happens when the next human comes along and theres only Toriels soul to let them through the barrier? And the human after that when there are no more Boss Monster souls and theyre trapped with the monsters?But I get the feeling youre convinced theres absolutely no moral gray area possible here so Im probably wasting words.,Undertale,d125i85,1,t5_2xdht

What youve got is essentially a film. But split into a hundred parts. With a searchbox interface. Well there is a tictactoe game in the game.

Since the human SOUL went so long after death before being absorbed somehow escaping destruction the only whole thing left is a hate for humans... somewhere.

7270849,0,t1_d24j0bt,What I initially wanted to say is that there are no extremes in this game. If a person only sees the extreme in something that might mean the person havent analysed things well I usually take a stance of asking people to figure things out themselves  that way they understand how and why things happen instead of trying to explain them while they already accepted the extreme as the truth.Discussions are really good when both sides are on the same distance from the truth that way it will get extremely interesting due to both sides trying to get closer to itwithout staying too much apart from each other. Basically its the same reason why people of different age will have difficulties in keeping up the discussion healthy and interestingit may be extremely interesting or may be extremely dull  their perception the distance to the truth is abnormally different.TLDR Overall if the level of knowledgeunderstanding etc. is close the discussion will almost always be interesting while the ones with different levels may be interesting or may not be interesting mostly these are not interesting from my experience there were exceptions  each rd ones thus why I prefer not to take risks and waste a lot of time writing things that wont be accepted due to the gap between the sides be that my knowledge being lower or the other sides.,Undertale,d24n9yf,1,t5_2xdht

Im not complaining its sad I understand that it cant always be sunshine and skittles. Im saying that it leaves a huge unsatisfactory untied knot. I would have either ended with the fact that he just permanently keeps his body from his one time interaction with every soul or he fades away entirely.

In some corners of the fandom Alphys is really really hated and had Alphys been an OC tied to a specific person I dont doubt that theyd have gotten the same amount if not more hate than So Sorry did Alphys being a forced encounter and hooking up with one of the best characters in the true ending. Regardless the whole fetish angle strikes me as concern trolling considering how hard it is to find out anything about Samael without outside influence and how easy it is to find porn of any of the popular characters. In the early days of the fandom there was porn of Monster Kid of all things in the top Google Image search results. ,Undertale,d2bfyiy,10,t5_2xdht

7461156,0,t1_d2q9ijq,well technically everythings a stylistic choice but thats just being pedanticthe point of sans saying how many times youve died is to rub it in your face how many times you died. it fits with the theme of DETERMINATION. that you just keep going. its kind of the same thing with the asgore fight that youre determined to find a way to spare him. however neither asgore nor sans show any other signs that they remember anything specific from the other timelines. sans doesnt know if youre going to be a good or bad person for example. ever since the update its also implied that any memories he does have are a little on the hazy side dont forget.the only confirmed way of remembering things across timelines is to have a certain amount of determination like with flowey or the human. as for sans he probably doesnt have any determination at all and the only way hes been aware of the timelines is through... the machine? nothings confirmed. the quote i gave you is good evidence against sans remembering timelines though,Undertale,d2qackh,3,t5_2xdht

7545026,0,t1_d2zqm9m,Balloon Boy is an enemy from Five Nights at Freddys . The reference lies in the similarity between his body and Sanss and in the formers tendency to laugh as he makes the game more difficult like how Sanss text bleeping sounds like chuckling to certain ears.Another reference could be found in the similarity of their activeness BB is a passive threat in FNAF  merely disabling the use of flashlight if you dont ward him off making the night harder but becomes able to jumpscare you in FNAF  which still doesnt cause a Game Over but is much more actively threatening. Compare this to Sans who doesnt act until theres no way out of a genocide run without resetting and is a very difficult opponent to deal with.spoilerThat said other than the points I mentioned above I see little resemblance to the two characters.,Undertale,d2ztzi9,3,t5_2xdht

I know from experience that telling them to knock it off will probably only make it worse since they get a reaction out of you and thats what fuels their harassment. The most advice I can offer is get new friends because from what youve described they dont seem like true friends anyways if they pick on you for liking a game. Dont let them get you down and dont let them influence your opinion on the game. I feel for you man and I know going through this kind of thing sucks. Just stay strong keep living your life and ignore the haters. ,Undertale,d3pum3k,3,t5_2xdht

Storyshift would not and could not exist without Undertale. But now with Undertale existing Storyshift changes those roles and the dynamics within them so spectacularly that sometimes it feels like the characters feel more natural in these newer places. Chara for instance just seems like such a natural fit for the judge of the game. A perfect choice given histheir appearance similarity to you and being the only other human besides you. It gives the final judgment new weight especially considering he wont die easily like a monster. He can be the only other character with your amount of resistance. Its just really interesting all around.,Undertale,d4sbd9r,22,t5_2xdht

Because you dont like the paper its printed on it is therefore okay to take the image and copy it onto another piece of paper that the artist has no control of.Look I get not liking Tumblr theres plenty of reasons not to like Tumblr. However not liking tumblr doesnt give you the right to be impolite towards the artists hosting their works on Tumblr. Artists are constantly struggling to keep control over their creations art is constantly being stolen.

Funny part is if you were using ms per frame fps PCMR the error is around what using a single precision float or even my float trimming for netcode to store that position would cause.So whatd I say in the very first post?

So no the player doesnt kill Flowey Asgore or erase the universe when they opt not to.The player is responsible for a ton by the end of the Genocide route but if your not given an active yes or no choice in a decision you are not responsible for it period.

8752183,0,t1_d6zehad,XD I know you already got corrected by the other guy but it always cracks me up when people still think this. I dont understand why people think that. I had a bit more explanation to add...To add to his comment it would literally be impossible for a vinyl of this to have more quality than a lossless digital format because this soundtrack is all computer generated. Basically all the dataquality already exists. Copying that to vinyl doesnt add anything. Its just a copy. The myth comes from the fact that in earlier digital recording tech they couldnt sample as much data as a tape could hold so it was better quality. In the s and s... Weve gotten to the point you could record at a sample rate higher than a vinyl holds. More than double actually.The reason people still prefer vinyl is they like some of the noise and imperfections that get added in because its a physical medium rather than a digital. For me personally I hate it. I like clean sharp digital noise but what sounds good is subjective. And thats why its still a thing.Sincerely An Audio Engineer,Undertale,d6zohkg,7,t5_2xdht

8896353,0,t1_d7h5lx9,I wasnt really sure how the whole monster and humans things would go because theres not that much information about the current human world. We know its most likely at modern day possibly beyond that. They had magic at some point and might still have or know about it. And that outside Ebott is a bit citycastlestructures.But I feel like itd be something more like an indian reserve or a china town in cities. Theres so few monsters they wouldnt have much more than a town or two. I guess itd probably be best to take a look at different history examples of groups of people suddenly living in a new place and refer to that. Im not really a history buff but I know thats not a new situation. In general theres some strife and differences and those can escalate into bigger scary skirmishes but over time things settle down and people are ok. There might be racism and worse but there might be open arms and mutual learning. Probably both as is the case in real life.Determination would be a tricky issue. Not really sure how itd go. Would Frisk still have it even though theres other humans? Does it only work in the Underground or just like a radius of it? No idea. Clearly normal people werent suddenly having reset powers so it was somehow contained in the area of the Underground. I think if humans found out about it itd be treated seriously. A tool that could wipe out timeprogress. Some might be smart and realize this is something that needs to be destroyed to prevent wars with other humans and there could be some that decide to use it as a weapon or tool. Sans would probably realize that its really dangerous for human kind and hed least cover it up really well also protecting Frisk for once... in the process. If Asriel has turned back into Flowey and decides to mess it all up though... Yeah. Good story potential there.Maybe once Frisk leaves the Underground he loses the reset powers just from proximity. And it goes to the only thing left in the Underground that can use it Flowey. But maybe Flowey has actually changed and just doesnt use it. Allows time to flow normal. That could be his garden that he tends. Sad but fitting. I kind of like that ending though I do really like the endings with angry Flowey in a flower pot.,Undertale,d7h7qbj,1,t5_2xdht

Still though just seemed totally unnecessary. Hey kid I could kick your ass and woulda killed you if it wasnt for your goatmom. And Sans doesnt really do much other than that dinner. I mean come on dude this kid is being super nice and saving everyone and you think Wow this is a great time to invite the kid for dinner and threaten them. Oh yeah and he said thanks for treating me so I dunno if he even made Frisk pay for that dinner!And then he ends it off with Its just a prank bro!!. Yeah my douchebag meter was starting to tick there. Also great for you Sans you can beat up a little kid. Are you proud of yourself?This kinda sums it up But not just that just in general... while hes definitely lazy and a funny guy and a friend he also seems to have a bit of a jerkarrogant side too. That scene really showed me that he actually DOES hold himself in a high regard being perfectly aware of himself and his ability and it seems to me that its gone to his head a little.But hey I kinda think of it as Toby just using him as a tool for that purpose. So I try not to let it hurt my opinion of Sans. Hes still my favorite NPC and I can relate to him more than any of the other characters and Ill admit I have my own asshole and grandstanding moments as well so maybe I have that much in common with him too.Besides I taught him to know his place by killing him  times in a row and then resetting ltNah just kidding!Or am I?o o,Undertale,d868hwn,19,t5_2xdht

Your actions can give them that power  or you can choose to teach Chara kindness resulting in the narration on the pacifist run. Chara chooses to show you their story and encourages you to help Asriel in the final battle. And so many people dont even realize anyone was there.

Then you open up a whole can of worms about what can and cannot happen within the world and what it all means.On the subject of theme music Ive always gone with the assumption than the music is for the situation rather than any one character. Battle against a true hero has leitmotifs associated with Undyne within it others have done very indepth musical analysis into that piece. If I knew where to find the analysis I would link you it but the TLDR that I can remember is These are motifs associated with Undyne but turned up to . Why Neo uses the same music? My only guess would be that they both go full anime because they have been pushed to the edge and because of their connections with Alphys.,Undertale,d9m8s50,1,t5_2xdht

This is because Undertale is a Game Maker game and so is actually running the Game Maker engine underneath it.

9866356,0,t3_5gmoyc,I think Toriel forgave Asgore a little because she let him work at the school garden at the end of the game we know that the only reason why Asgore has declared another war against humanity was because of his anger after his son died but we dont know when Toriel left Asgore after that or we dont even know if Asgore has killed the other  humans.There is also a fact that Toriel is so unforgiving she even fired Alphys when she knew about Alphys mistakes IIRC when you talk to someone in Snowdin There is also that part where Toriel tells Asgore if he wanted to free the monsters he could have gotten one SOUL taken six SOULs then break the barrier wouldnt that solution make it worse? Because every monster in the Underground still have hatred to humans also why did she talk about that one SOUL like its not a big deal? And how can Asgore get  human SOULs? I know that human SOULs persist after death but I dont think they stay right where they are that makes it strange because from what we see from Toriel that she wants peace between monsters and humans.Also for the Soriel ship I think a lot of people support it because there is this one neutral ending if you kill Papyrus only where Sans stays with Toriel and tells you not to come back IIRC.I also think that Toriel and Asgore can go back to each other but as friends not as lovers because in the cast if the Dogis names are yellow the game says Finally NO.  Nose Nuzzle Champions. but its also hard to forgive because they cant forget Asriels death and the events occurred after that.,Undertale,datlxkt,1,t5_2xdht

And there are  possible epilogues to the neutral endings. Id recommend doing the Genocide run but not as your first time. It wont ruin your next runs or anything it does affect them tho its just not fun to do and it loses its charm if you havent done one of the other runs before. Also some of the lore you find out during the Genocide run doesnt make a lot of sense unless you know the lore a Pacifist run offers.

10855922,0,t1_ddzn6zd,If what you say is true does this mean that the monsters are depressive by nature? They each have a SOUL but they dont have DETERMINATION. And monsters themselves believe that their own souls are composed of love mercy and compassion and cannot exist without those things but theyre all flawed in some way too. If DETERMINATION is not just a supernatural power but rather also a personal quality does this mean that the monsters dont have enough DETERMINATION to find their way out of the bind theyre in? Maybe then the war of humans and monsters was lost by the monsters because the humans had the determination to win and the monsters meekly submitted to their fate. Or maybe the monsters physical forms are weaker remember they all lose to a CHILD in a genocide run and thus they are easily overpowered physically by the humans. Where physical presence is one manifestation of determination and perhaps the reason why Undine and Sans are so damned hard to defeat.A bit of an aside. I love how many things that Undertale is a commentary on.

10965396,0,t3_5wiarm,Maybe there wasnt an opening before. Ground shifts over time sinkholes can open up erosion takes place. Over millennia something like that would have happened. This could have even happened in other places in the Underground but that was the only location that had a survivable fall. Long grass will partially go across a pit so a child might end up falling because they didnt realize the edge was a few inches closer than it visibly looked or they might not have seen the pit to begin with. There was something that would be fascinating to a kid who wouldnt be cautious enough to avoid danger like an interesting tree to climb a cool rock a creek etc. When the child goes near it the child falls. I witnessed something like this almost happen to my brother as a kid.When I was a little kid my younger brother and I were out walking in the woods on our land one nice summer day. There had been a bad storm a week or so earlier. We noticed some areas that we normally walked in had changed drastically and areas near the creek were not entirely stable. For instance large pieces of the bank had fallen away. Our parents were busy I think with moving a few fallen trees so we were unattended for a bit as no one trusted two kids near chainsaws. We had the bright idea to go exploringtrespassing on the neighbors land and set off for adventure.We followed the creek as it merged with another creek and became bigger. We continued walking on the bank as it hung over the stream over  feet below. We were walking side by side and that is the reason I wasnt eaten by the hole as well. My brother dropped from sight next to me and screamed. I looked down to see that he had caught himself and was frantically trying to pull himself up grasping at the easily broken grass around him.  feet below him there were rocks several with a sharp edge and broken tree roots one that had broken as a spike and was pointing upwards. My brother would get scraped up at best and killed at worst.My brother was wearing a toy tool belt at this time around his waist. I reached down and picked him up by it with one hand showing strength that I was not normally capable of and tossed him to the side to safety. We caught our breaths he thanked me for saving his life I was very proud and we turned back. The dirt where my brother would have landed appeared loose. The dirt wouldnt have looked that way had it been exposed to the elements for awhile. I think that the storm must knocked over the tree making a hole in the ground and thus making a nice trap for unwary children. The hole was partially covered by the long nevermowed grass. Maybe an adult could have spotted the pit before landing in it or might have been able to climb out but I didnt spot it either and I dont know if I could have escaped without help had I had fallen in.,Undertale,deb04ns,3,t5_2xdht

Like in the original game he keeps his home in the Ruins open to everyone and enjoys listening to people and helping with their problems. He has tried to make the Ruins more comfortable for the monsters who live there. When Frisk tries to leave the Ruins he does not try to keep them there but instead tries giving up his SOUL feeling that it is better that he do so than Toriel.Again Im not saying you have to like what I do but just trying to point out that I do at least try to respect the characterization as seen in the original game. ,Undertale,dehe7hf,2,t5_2xdht

So dont worry all that will happen is that youll get one final reminder of what you did before. Better to accept it and move on.After all the point of Chara appearing in a Soulless Pacifist ending is to remind you that your actions have consequences.

11193124,0,t3_5zsa0n,A lot of people are saying the genocide run is for the challenge but it isnt. It is both a critique on RPG design and a drastic change in storyline and tone. The genocide route isnt supposed to be fun per se. Rather it is the antithesis to the true pacifist run. What happens after a true pacifist run? Youre supposed to let go of the game and let frisk live their lives. Thats what even flowey wants you to do. The genocide route is for those who wont let go of the game and want to see all the world has to offer. Remember why flowey started killing? Because eventually after all of his resets the people he knew started to seem less like people and more like characters he already knew exactly what they would do in almost any situation and it was boring. So he changed things up. He played the bad guy started killing everyone. Not out of malice or hate but simply because he was curious. When you do a genocide run you take floweys role in a sense. You kill not because its fun or because youre bored but because you just want to see what happens.,Undertale,df0q73t,2,t5_2xdht

11375491,0,t3_62b94k,Same. Its a simple concept yet results in huge changes. At the very least itd make a fascinating AU but I think the biggest barrier is the sheer amount of speculation involved.Beyond how Toriel would react to being killed and absorbed how would the protagonist act? How much of their actions will be influenced or even downright controlled by their passenger? Would any of their personalities change? Will they survive death or split apart like CharaAsriel did?Basically its nearly entirely new ground from that point on which is why I think no one has done it yet.,Undertale,dfle54p,2,t5_2xdht

11589279,0,t1_dg9m4oj,Papyrus is skilled but there are stronger monsters thats without including Asgore. Muffet Mercenaries Mettaton and Hotland enemies have higher stats.  Increased defence can be explained by him bracing for incoming blow as that is how monsters work. He knows that Frisk is a murderer on that route even someone who cant see them feels it and he will most likely die so he is ready to take it.Sans is also skilled but unlike Papyrus hes pathetically weak fortunately Undertales world works like a game without actually being a game and so he can cheat.,Undertale,dg9nht2,1,t5_2xdht

11617558,0,t3_65sc96,The way youre truly expected to play this game is play through blind finish feel guilty for killing replay as a pacifist get the true ending then get curious and go on a murderous rampage and finally replay as a pacifist one last time.  But really you can play however the hell you want.  Youll just miss out on stuff if you skip the two major endings.  So TLDR just keep playing.  The game has good replay value.,Undertale,dgcuzm0,5,t5_2xdht

11751863,0,t1_dgrxlhp,I dont really think the difference between a  karma hit vs a  karma hit gaster blaster first frame damage above  vs below  is minuscule but yeah probably didnt notice because youre probably not going to be above  for much of the fight.  Well unless youre not getting hit in which case you wouldnt notice because well youre not getting hit. tbh I didnt fully understand what was going on when I fought Sans either.  I noticed I was getting chunked hard when I was near full but I figured that was because I suck got overconfident and fucked up bad.  It wasnt until I saw their November post that I realized that it wasnt just because I suck.  ,Undertale,dgs3q2v,1,t5_2xdht
