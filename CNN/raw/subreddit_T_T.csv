3916124,0,t3_35ayvv,. seconds of shield is perfectly fine thats an extra . seconds we can stay up there which is fine.Phase s ticking damage is hardly an issue the damage comes from people dribbling with spears slag mines and smashes.Sending a Healer up is a shot to the foot. Were up there to kill them as fast as possible the healer will be occupied healing himself and if uses AoE heals he wont be able to keep up with the damage after  stacks his mana may have an anuerysm.We could run Kames as Disc and Punjh as Holy CoWs extend our uptime in the stands and I dont think we can handle adds with out itOther than that we do not need any changes in Phase . We wipe to three things. Slag Mines Missed spears and poor tank cooldowns.Our Tanks really need to be on the ball with cooldowns and need to communicate with healers for external cooldown usage.  Hands of Sacrife used on a  minute fight is silly  . min cd used in said  minute fight also is ridiculousWe fix that we win game,T_T,cr2o9vf,1,t5_2tlqv
