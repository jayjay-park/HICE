After a few weeks of constantly listening to Hamilton and discovering that Lin was a freakin genius I decided to check out his other Tony award winning musical and man was I blown away again. Love the music the themes and characters. I am going to London in March and In The Heights is playing there till until January ...wish it was on longer wouldve loved to go see it. ,InTheHeights,d8kb6nf,3,t5_3gsm5
