4880087,0,t1_ctl5nsj,I generally find that its the small libraries that get crammed with books while the larger ones have more and more computers or empty space. My university had just built a brand new sixstory library. The basement and the first and second floors had rows of computers which were always full. Meanwhile the other floors had the books and a lot of the shelves were empty. I asked why and the staff said they had spent the majority of their funding on computers and couldnt afford to keep up certain journal subscriptions or even buy necessary books that students read. Like they were missing certain works of William Shakespeare and Mark Twain because they couldnt afford to buy them. Im completely disgusted by this turn of events. ,bookporn,cu9o82w,1,t5_2sa5v
