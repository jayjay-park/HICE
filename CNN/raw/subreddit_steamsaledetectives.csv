Step  In the box that appears type v and select ok.That gives you a badge its not  confirmed yet but the Potato Sack ARG ended with Valve requiring everyone to earn potatoes in the Potato Sack games to unlock Portal  early.

I basically argued from the same standpoint as you though  its a Valve ARG therefore it should do X  so if you want to be exact I was pointing out your No True Scotsman. Or rather Yes True Scotsman I suppose.Unrelated side note this is why I hate naming fallacies in arguments. They lead to nothing but pointless squabble about how and whether they apply and if yes why not  and basically derail the conversation. Instead of saying thats a No True Scotsman instead point out why you think it is. Make a point not a statement. That way both parties avoid any inconsistencies andor misunderstandings.gt Obviously this is all hypothesis I notice you didnt quote the part where I specifically said exactly that.I felt no need to as that part of your post was correct. I was focusing on the parts where I thought you were not.gt I didnt claim any of my inferences as fact.Except for yknow in the title of the thread. Which is what the conversation with the previous poster was originally about and why I decided to throw in my two cents in the first place. I wasnt saying your opinion is wrong I was saying your use of the word definitely is wrong and heres why.Its not like it really matters now. Either its over or its not.
