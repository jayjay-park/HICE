7246550,0,t1_d21cirt,Howwhen do you use classic push vs top queen vs normal?I always used classic push because its sooooo broken in solo que. I add as many good jungler mains as possible and go duo with them. Then i make them babysit me and help me take  heralds first one around th minute. If i ultra push turret i deny enemey toplaner farm but i also become an easy target for enemy jungler thats why he usually insta ganks me around  as soon as he is done with his upper jungle. Thats where my premade jungle does his job. I have  shaco mains in friend list and few graves udyrs  khas and evelynns and i make them counterjungle and countergank Once enemy jungler is disabled i can continue carelessly pushing top and denying farm. In solo que enemies usually dont know how to respond to splitpushing and thats why they lose the game. When im done with st turret i take over mid and push it so my midlaner can double gank bot with our jungler vs. I used this build in all my games to climb up the rank.I have to be honest. I have normal heimerdinger mid masteries ready but i never actually played it. I started doing Top FQC build on top and when im solo bot and i had like  loses in ranked but thats only because i was experimenting my heimer win rate a bit ruined but it was worth i guess. I figured now when its best to rush FQC before getting banner and zz like i usually do and this is when i do it If they take squishyofftank toplaner like nasus or something i decide to rush FQC. Why? Cdr and mana regen cooldown reduction and dmg is crucial to wining lane vs nasuslike champions. Cooldown is op because he can easly take down your turrets if he maxes his E spell and you need it to constantly place new turrets. He is gonna run out of mana with his constant spamming E on your turrets and thats when you will start to dominate. Just push hard so he cant farm under his turret. Also Dongers W and E have big cooldown and its good to have cdr so you can keep him from getting closer to minions. Sooooo long story short i rush FQC when i play vs a champ that has no dashes and sustain and you wanna set up big dominance on lane. You have that gold per second from FQC and i get some gold per second in runes too so i can buy zz at same time i would usually buy it. The only thing why FQC would suck is that you are farm more squishy then when you rush banner or zz instead so dont rush FQC if you are playing vs enemy who can kill you in a combo.How easy is Donger jungle? Ill admit my only experience is when I roam and often scaryDonger can easly clear jungle route you have some youtube guides to help you. The biggest flaw is that Heimer is easly counterjungled so let your teammates know that they will need to ward your jungle sometimes. Jungle Heimer is best when you have laners with cc example Pantheon top lane. When Panth jumps on enemy you can  hit him with grenade and prolong the stun then you just finish him with W and Panths uses QE to finish. If i cant kill enemies i atleast get them low and send them to base. Then i push lane for  seconds with my topmid laner and get our minions under enemy turret so turret would kill them and deny opponents cs that way i also help push turret and let my laner get some time to recall before enemy pushes his minions back to our turret. I played jungle only on platgold rank tho and dont know how well it works on diamond rank. P.S. there is a way to solo dragon with turrets on lvl  but i still havent tried it.None of your pages has a CDR rune is there a reason?Im too lazy to save ip for new runes If i didnt explain something nicely please let me know so i can reformulate my answer. My English is not a topnotch and im sleepy at the moment already forgot what i wrote and dont bother reading it again and correcting it,HeimerdingerMains,d21vqci,2,t5_39cx3
8034541,0,t1_d4j50l4,If your trying to find his IGN try heisenbongna. He almost always uses the build shown in the video.,HeimerdingerMains,d4j5pb7,1,t5_39cx3

8638630,0,t3_4y6t0f,I mean in this sub youll probably hear Heimerdinger is the best he is. We might not be impartial though he is the best though.I dont see much of Muerte anymore though. The few times Ive seen him hes done pretty well iirc. But Heimer is probably the funnest champ in the game. I dont know of many other champs with the ability to turn a gank the way Heimer does.Off topic when Morde first got his rework he was often played bot with a support. Went against a mordeHeimer duo bot that did surprisingly well. After a while we just couldnt handle them in lane. Not fun,HeimerdingerMains,d6lfr3v,2,t5_39cx3
11682951,0,t1_dgk2vlu,I dont really talk with too many other high elo Heimer mains so I dont know whats going on with them and what their situation is. For me personally I was just bored of League and up until a couple of weeks ago I hadnt even played the game for  months. I have no doubt I can hit Master again playing the champ Im still shaking a little bit of the rust off after being away from the game but the climb is going alright so far. This meta is pretty favorable for Heimer right now IMO.Theres a good amount of assassins being picked which he plays well into tanks in the top lane arent bad to deal with. Ive dealt with far less enjoyable metas in season  last year Syndra was mid all the time so I couldnt lane there without a ban Ryze was a difficult matchup to deal with there was a fair amount of Quinn top going on for awhile in higher elo Kennen ADC has replaced that annoyance though and is arguably worse to play against a lot of Jayce in S as well.For my playstyle theres really only two aspects that got nerfed. You cant take a camp at level  and have an XP advantage and the stats on Rylai got a bit of a nerf. I never enjoyed ZzrotBanner so those changes dont affect me all that much. I did build Banner against very heavy AP comps but it was very infrequent. And with regards to taking a camp in half my games anyway the jungler would be a dick and demand I leash instead of letting me take the camp so I walk into lane level  with no turrets set up. At least now since Im not taking the camp I have time to set up my turrets and have a decent early lane.Edit Heisendong is essentially in Challengerhigh Master. If you look at op.gg and hit the Solo MMR button he has Master MMR and you can tell its accurate by the people hes playing against. MMR is all that really matters Did he decay maybe? so there is a Heimer representative in high elo for now. Also looking at his account it doesnt look like hes too active at the moment. Again I dont know his situation if hes taking a break from the game or maybe playing on another account or something?,HeimerdingerMains,dgka2hz,2,t5_39cx3
