2682802,0,t3_2qpcwb,As far as controlling for your variables you need simply add them to the regression. For the graph you can play with the menu interface. I honestly dont like STATA for my graphs.,stata,cn8rgmc,2,t5_2stu0
3402048,0,t3_2z56hv,I am not near my computer but to answer your question the pre test was an actual written survey administered and collected just before an education intervention basically a ppt lecture was given. The post test was administered immediately after and had basically the same questions. Two months later we emailed participants to ask that they fill out a follow up survey online  same set of questions. The purpose was to see if responses changed immediately after and if these changes were maintained in the follow up. As soon as i get home i will try to do this. Thanks for your help. I definitely need it.,stata,cpg24wu,1,t5_2stu0
3678959,0,t1_cqb7as0,that may be it but even when I run only the occupations or only the industries it still kicks it back to me. I worry that it has something to do with the volume of observations and number of fixed effects variables.,stata,cqbmj4x,1,t5_2stu0

5170239,0,t3_3ltjve,gen scale  day    week    month   will sum up the conditionals i.e. day   returns value  if day is the dummy for whether x happened in the last  hrs.This will suffice if youre simply going for frequency i.e. you dont want to distinguish between the occurrence of the event within the past day versus the past week etc.,stata,cv97czm,3,t5_2stu0

9471001,0,t3_5ah5e8,gt Male if not male and a corresponding one for female. This is literally a question for an intro to metrics quiz. I suggest going back to your text and reading the section on multicollinearity. The short answer is you need to have one binary variable for gender either   male or   female but not both. Im assuming youre missing a few observations for gender or have people coded as neither as generally stata drops redundant vars to avoid this very issue. Same thing with regions either have one factor variable or  binary variables.,stata,d9gi8al,5,t5_2stu0
