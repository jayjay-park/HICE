4536238,0,t1_ct28yx6,gt There needs to be some sort of limiting restrictions to cause players to pick and choose when and what to use. If there are no restrictions it falls into a Game Design problem called Dominant Strategy...I fail to see how dominant strategy applies here. If a superior option is available to only one kind of Dust it will theoretically be used with that kind of Dust. If the same mechanics are available with all kinds of Dust different people will use different abilities.Variety has nothing to do with the relative viability of strategies. If anything more variety means a higher chance of FUBARing something. Simplified Example . DampD. The cleric druid and wizard are more powerful than other classes but they have relative advantages and disadvantages meaning no one is terribly superior to any other and with the exception of the halforc wizard any race can do pretty well as any of the three. But introduce Monster Manual races and gray elf wizards have a serious advantage over any other raceclass combination. Bam dominant strategy by adding complexity.Im not sure how my suggestion would add any dominant strategy. Maybe if you explained what dominant strategy there might be abd why it wouldnt be in your system?,RWBYD20,ct2fals,1,t5_38jxo

5476766,0,t1_cwbp8sf,The wield also changes available attack abilities to use with the weapon. In the case you used it is a Heavy weapon and would use a D when Handed and a D Handed allowing either a Free Hand or a Shield in this case a Free Hand,RWBYD20,cwbpi58,1,t5_38jxo
