It refuces stick to the wire.I do burn the plastic from the wire and i dont really have this problem with normal wires. Just the thin ones most headphones.EDIT Did some research. Apparently you should not burn the wires to the rid of the coating rather just sandpaper them if possible. If you burn them acetone might help afterwards.,techsupportmacgyver,ceest29,1,t5_2up7a

That is also why you should not use UPS for central heating backup because it will destroy the pump. And as few people here mentioned cheap UPSes are not build for running on battery for more than couple of minutes. Just enough to power down your PC and not overheat. Youll have to look for much more expensive server models and these are usually V or V system with several batteries.But ff your device uses wall wart just buy voltage regulator and you can power the device directly from the battery this is what Im using for my router.

There are numerous applications that call for one or the other.  In uNecoras explanation a grounded metal chassis serves to protect an end user in the event that a conductor comes loose inside.  Alternatively check out the write up under the Applications heading on this Wikipedia articleIt details a very valid use case where a device phone charger is left floating and is made just as safe as a grounded metal chassis through the use of a nonconductive plastic chassis.
