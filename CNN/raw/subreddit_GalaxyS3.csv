4603123,0,t3_3e1zxy,Hi! For the same exact reasons  adding to those the fact that CM has been abandoned  I switched to CM.The version Ive been using is not official since i is unsupported for CM by the team but it runs very smoothly. It seems to have a better battery life even if it is degrading naturally due to old age...This is the versionIts a good thing it is open source so its fixable even if they stop supporting it.,GalaxyS3,ctat74s,1,t5_2u1ok

6256006,0,t1_cz0fzv6,Might still be the battery. New ones are dirt cheap on eBay worth a try. Many tales of new batteries fixing possessed phones on this sub. A bad battery corrupted my S it ran ok for a while when I reinstalled the OS but became corrupted again soon after. It would act up even when charging because of this. A new battery and another reinstall fixed the problem.,GalaxyS3,cz0qmv7,1,t5_2u1ok

7364776,0,t1_d2f92dd,Sorry I dont know of any solutions. Youll need to ask a real phone geek.Is your phone a dual or quad ban by any chance. Does your phone have a sim card slot? Ive never seen a gsmcdma dual band phone but it might be worth checking. If it does youre in luck. Ive heard of iphone users converting technologies Have you discussed this with your carrier. It seems theyre the responsible party and would should replace the phone. Other than that the only solution I can offer is to sell your new phone and buy another phone or find someone to trade it with.,GalaxyS3,d2fbor8,1,t5_2u1ok
