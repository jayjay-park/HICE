Its fascinating because it defies almost any effort to play freely through it. You have to know it its that simple. It has changes in it and theyre very strict and they have lots of real dissonant moments. So the angularity of it was fascinating to me the tonality was because its one of those things where you really have to stretch to figure out something appropriate to play to add to the tonal mood of the tune. ,grateful_dead,cj1o495,3,t5_327wk

For relevance to this sub check out this HelpSlip.

2776404,0,t1_cniv3n0,Annoyingly both the Winterland  and a lot of the  stuff is actually really problematic to work with sonically the multitracks have a wide variety of issues that make them very time consuming to address.Also frankly I feel that both runs suffer in comparison to the years around them when listened to closely as a whole. That is I dont honestly think theyre worth the work. They benefit from cherrypicking which has already been done. .. is worth an eventual official release though.The Euro  both have ownershiplicensing rights issues i.e. the band does not own them but that is not insurmountable.Since the documentary film is definitely coming out I think whatever Rhino is working on will be audio oriented though it could have video in it.As far as I know the negotiations for the return of the lates Betty boards have not yet been successful. I feel like it should happen at some point though and as soon as it does there will be an explosion of superb releases. Summer  is really only going to attract people who were seeing shows then and hardcore heads. To most listeners Garcias vocal problems and the wildly uneven performance quality from incredible to really bad within practically every show even the best ones from the year is really offputting. I can certainly agree that there need to be more releases from  especially the summer but I cant imagine a big release being a good idea.Besides one show per year you could do a one show per era defined however you like  primal classic roots rock wall of sound arena rock etc for a more reasonably scopedaffordable box or even some kind of diskorso chronology with one song or segued run of songs from each year.,grateful_dead,cnjo1a9,5,t5_327wk
