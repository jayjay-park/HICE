As was stated up threadgt Those not contributing taxes on the dolewelfare on WIC should not have the right to vote.

10701738,0,t1_ddjr67k,Sorry no.Lack of education causes unchecked nonfactual news to be believed as fact.Youve proved my point with this statementampgtNot now with the interwebs news cannot be censoredThe inherent problem is that what is factual news should be determined by supporting evidence and the failed education systems have brought up generations of people who dont have any critical thinking skills are unable to pull apart arguments and are unable or unwilling to research what is put in front of them to find out whats actually factual.The interwebs hasnt uncensored news its just given anyone the ability to post whatever bullshit they want regardless of basis in fact and social media means it gets shared thousands of times. People take the easy bait get quickly outraged and share to their friends.Never mind that the whole thing was made up as per the Clinton child Sex ring and hundreds of other examplesWhat you end up with is everything that doesnt support someones opinion being branded as fake news regardless of evidence. Everything the right disagrees with they shout fake news and similarly though to a much lesser extent everything the left disagrees with they call fake news.Theyve never been taught how to discern exactly what fake news is and how to ascertain an articles worth and veracity and more importantly theyve never been taught why its important to verify an articles veracity or the validity of their own opinion.Instead they think an opinion is equivalent to fact and many people here on this board will vehemently defend their own opinion regardless of what overwhelming evidence you might be able to throw up because theyve been brought up to think being wrong is a bad trait when in reality we should be teaching everyone that its more important to be corret than it is to not be wrong.,theredpillright,ddjszfa,2,t5_3ix0c
10953159,0,t1_de9okkh,i couldnt even see the argument its behind a pay wall for me.attacking the person is a fallacy known as ad hominem.the people in the US let this situation go to shit and the people in the EU too admittedly. the protest shouldnt be about taking on not taking the consequences of the conflict it shold be about ending the conflict for good. and punishing who started it with lies for example the wmd shitstorm,theredpillright,de9qo3f,1,t5_3ix0c
10983221,0,t3_5wrqex,On the Fairness and equality part of leftism.I liken this to everyone being in a room the room is society with no roof and only a net for a floor.People slipping through the cracks is a serious problem from a moralfairness point of view as well as a selfish point of view. I dont want roving gangs of homeless looting and pillaging because there are no homeless shelters or welfare programs. In some way welfare is paying someone not to commit crimes to survive.The trouble is that people seemingly always equate having a solid floor with a solid roof. That is restricting freedoms and limiting how high you can achieve.The flip side is limitless achievement with no roof and also no floor. Fly high but also fall deep.Id much prefer a solid floor where there is a solid baseline of fairness and equality that is the lowest point anyone can fall in society. Ideally where survival is not at risk. As well as not limiting how high you can achieve.Im probably rare in this opinion here but Im pretty bullish on the idea of basic income as it provides a survival baseline that ensures everyone will have a survival income if required.,theredpillright,decww2d,8,t5_3ix0c

11006797,0,t1_def0vb7,gt many of those traits are associated with conservative values  but dont actually translate to legislatationThis is why we have Trump. The hard working conservative voters are not at all happy with the soft left direction that GOP and Dems are going. Your criticism is not of conservatism itself but the elites and their smug manipulation of the voter. RINO sums it up. Politicians are too well paid too well bribed and legislate to persoanlly profit. We the people are being treated as slaves and idiots. Me and Trump supporters completely agree with you on that point.gt Politics is much more complex than just me making gains in life  and requires a different set of goals lenses and frameworks to solve the problems that come upGroup decisions are just decisions. You are quoting a line of thinking is intended to obfuscate clear discussion making. Politics is not a zero sum game. It is not true that for one party to gain the others must suffer. The enemy of clear decision making is compromise. From principles comes policy and the policy serves no one if it is compromised into complete inefficiency. You not agreeing with a legislation does not mean it must be neutered by guilt laden emotional issues. Some legislation you are not going to like. If the govt you didnt vote for is in power you wont like what it does. I dont like the tax laws. The world doesnt end because its not going entirely your way.gt the right is too loyal to dumbass christians.The dumbasses yes. While I am not at all religious some very good people hold beliefs I find ridiculous. They are still good people.gt Sure global warming gets a SJW attachmentBecause its BS. Sorry to break it to you but no action we are doing is harming the earth more than if Elelphants were the dominant species. You walk on sand you leave a footprint. Its all natural no doomsday. Again flawed thinking of in fact a religious nature impreganted at an early age before adult critical thought. And I really mean religious its stone age failed crops because humans displeased the gods stuff. Pretty much like creationism.gt I think many scientist and coders lean politically liberal bc it offers a wider range of solutions to fit specific problems Principles are not chosen based on the rewards. They are chosen because you believe their value is the most important. I have always been a tackler of the hard jobs. And I despise the minimum effort workers. Could have taken the easy path but my principles said no.gt  I believe in helping people and making an equal playing fieldSo do conservatives. We just believe in leaving people to excel on their own. Affirmative actions tokenism whilte guilt are all not intended to make an equal playing field but to advantage a minority and give the appearance that we are all equally capable. Of course that isnt true at all. The lefts aim is not equal playing field but equal outcome even if you didnt give a shit and make an effort.gt Even though in theory conservatives are for less spending it seems they really just care about rich people and the military if U look at policies.The only real purpose of a state is to protect its citizens. Money on defence is about the only really justifable state expenditure. Now Im not saying its wisely spent especially on foreign policy. The rich are rich no policy will really affect them. The poor contribute almost nothing. Its the middle that suffers paying for those who didnt bother along with a few genuinely misfortunate. Paying for mad schemes of ideology because lobybists think that tax money is free money.gt The fact I could go to jail for smoking a joint is beyond reasonI do not approve of the increasing dropouts of society for smoking a joint. It literally gives the smoker persmission to not take responsibility. I hate that. Very. Much. And Im talking about parents. I am glad pot is illegal in most states and federally. I hope your liberals views are not based on you wanting to smoke pot. Principles and pot do not go together.gt  I think we should agile in our politics systems and embrace change which falls in opposition with conservatismI see no sign of this. That a bit of a slur the left like to say but it isnt true. Weve had enormous fast changes in the last decades. My favorite example is electric cars and renewables. They just arent competitive yet. The moment that happens the big corporates will be all over them. The slow change to renewables isnt because the greedy polluters are slow to move its because the renewables are unreliable and uncompetitive.If you made it this far in the post I agree with much of your intentions but I feel there are a number of false arguments which you havent questioned. They are deliberate lies which are easy to swallow on the surface and easily spread but they arent actually true. I persoanlly believe that most liberals are merely misled rather than the antiChrist.,theredpillright,defl8hl,2,t5_3ix0c
11013724,0,t1_def4fl1,Government regulation causes monopoly so being proregulation and antimonopoly isnt a coherent position. Regional ISP monopolies being a good example. Its like you value rightwing principles like economic competition but you believe the narrative that the way to achieve competition is via government control which is baseless. Regulation should more aptly be described as crony capitalism regulators and large corporations feed off each other.,theredpillright,degdhyv,1,t5_3ix0c

You seem to be searching for a fight rather than adding to the discussion.In my opinion you cant fix societies. They go through natural cycles that you can only speed up or slow down. You cant reverse them. You should do what you think is best for you using current reality not some utopia.,theredpillright,dgnbjsy,3,t5_3ix0c
