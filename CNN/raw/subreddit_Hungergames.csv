1265334,0,t1_cib2mic,Actually yeah. Youre right about that. I was thinking more of the sensibilities of the characters in ASOIAF itself and how thats just a shitty fact of life for many of them. Its usually primarily the reader who is particularly disturbed by the fact that a lot of the atrocities and squicky marriage consummations etc are committed against children.In HG though most of the characters themselves see how terrible it is to force children into the games emphasized by Rue and Prims reapings and the reactions toward them including some Capitol citizens. But in GoT EVERYONE is dealing with crises and horrible abuses and some of them are unfortunately very young. In Hunger Games the entire problem is that its the children who are made to suffer the most  which brings about the entire plot. TLDR In ISOIAFGoT there are young people who have to deal with the same life and death issues as adults. In HG the bad guys target children. So a game would likely have to involve the killing of children which IMO is not a great idea.,Hungergames,cibysdv,2,t5_2sfjs

1291792,0,t1_ciex2tt,Well if you really want to know heres my review with spoilers removed.My words cant even begin to express how disappointed I am in this book. I waited for this book like a kid waits for Santa on Christmas Eve. So needless to say I was super excited for the conclusion of one of my favorite trilogies. Then I finally bought my copy. I also bought the short stories book at the same time. I decided to read the short stories to get back into things. So when I finally started on Requiem I was psyched!While I was reading I was waiting for SOMETHING to happen. It was just so boring. Then finally the action comes but it only lasts a little bit of the book and it was so rushed. There were so many loose ends left that it irked me to death. So many questions left unanswered. UGH! Its making me angry just writing this review.I had my hopes up for nearly a year for something that should have been even better than Delirium and Pandemonium but yet it was an epic fail. The characters were boring the story was boring the relationships were boring it was just BORING!Then in the end there is absolutely NO resolution to any of the major issues of the series. It was just a poorly constructed novel all around. Which is not something I expect of Lauren Oliver. This is the first time Ive ever considered returning a book to the store which I dont think you can do anyway. ,Hungergames,ciexysz,1,t5_2sfjs

1384292,0,t3_29ymf6,Well I do not really agree. First a couple of things. I think she became the it girl because of getting cast in the Hunger Games not the other way around. Second I think it would have been a bad decision to go for Emma Watson or Kirsten Stewart since they already had their own iconic teen girl roles. Third I think Emily Blunt although amazing would have been too old for the role I mean Katniss is supposed to be  when she gets reaped even Lawrence is a tad old for that.On the elevator scene yes that might be overacting but that is more the directors choice than Lawrences. In the behind the scenes they actually talk about Woody Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks overacting constantly in all kinds of ways trusting the director to pick what is right for the film.But I do believe Jennifer Lawrence was a fantastic pick for Katniss. I agree with Gary Ross who cast her that she has incredible emotional power and depth. I dont think there are a lot of young actresses that can match it especially in the role of Katniss but that last part might be hindsight speaking.I think Lawrence is a great fit for the role and I dont think many others would have been able to carry the movies and franchise as a whole like her.But coming back to my point about the elevator scene from what I read in your post you dont agree with the directing moreso than with the actress.,Hungergames,cipsygt,6,t5_2sfjs

Contrast to hardly having any nice clothes in the district  apart from wearing something smart on reaping day. You also have Katniss trying to sell Prims baby clothes. You can look at food as another comparison. Its clear everyone in  is starving. In  you will either die from undernourishment illness or coal mines. Yet on the train and whilst they stay in the holding hotel they can eat whatever they want as much as they want. I think there might be a contrast for drinks too to do with hot chocolate?

2483992,0,t3_2nzgor,Id have to agree about the maturity of the politics in the film. Ive not read the books my wife has and Ive paid only glancing attention to the previous two movies so when I accompanied my wife to see Mockingjay today I was expecting a bit of a nap to be honest. I was wrong. I sat bolt upright and barely noticed two hours had passed.In todays political climate a film which deals openly with the uses of political propaganda by the ostensible good guys who are taking up arms against a government is highly courageous. One moment in the film focuses on what label the government will apply to the insurgents and its done quite delicately avoiding sensation while still conveying the agenda behind word choice. One persons freedom fighter is another persons terrorist and this film manages to acknowledge that without heavyhandedness. Very well done.,Hungergames,cmisnvi,7,t5_2sfjs

2925569,0,t3_2tlvyc,It was to show the change that had occurred in Gale or perhaps how he truly was. He would hurt innocent people to try to hurt the Capitol  to rebel. Katniss is repulsed by this since she does want change but she refuses to hurt innocent people and only really has killed people in the Arena under lifeordeath circumstances.If you read the epilogue you know that Peeta never fully recovers  he still has to fight it from time to time he just somewhat better. Peeta fought the programming and was how he was able to warn Katniss in time. You see bits and pieces of him trying to fight through the programming after he has been rescued and through the game of realornotreal learns what is the truth and what is lies to help to try to recover. Also we dont have the full grasp of the technology Panem has so its very possible a change could happen in  weeks and Snow pretty much lets Peeta go in order for him to be sent to D to hurt Katniss.Coin was showing herself to be as bad as Snow. Snow was in custody and was going to die soon anyways. Katniss has one chance at taking out Coin and ending what would have been a dictatorship no better than Snows.,Hungergames,co0nafo,6,t5_2sfjs

10292511,0,t3_5ndhf8,Peeta was angry at Katniss for failing to tell him about president Snows visit. He had no idea that he went to her house and threatened her to play up the love story and subdue the districts. When Peeta offered Thresh and Rues family money it was the exact opposite of subduing the districts and had he known of Snows threats he wouldnt have done that which did put his family in danger. Snow cant really seek revenge directly against a victor so hed go after their family instead. In that moment his family did need him to act appropriately and protect them so they wouldnt be in danger whether they knew it or not. However their survival wasnt dependent on him. He was the youngest of three boys and by the looks of it fairly inconsequential to his mother. They had a business and a stable source of income and had he died while they would have been sad they could have gotten on without him in the long run. Katniss on the other hand was the sole provider of food for her family and helped Gales family as well. Had she died her family surely would have starved shortly after. Gale wouldnt have been able to hunt enough to feed both families. They would also have had to give up their home in the Victors Village had she died in the Quell because it was only Katniss house. ,Hungergames,dcapmzf,8,t5_2sfjs

11405329,0,t1_dfogd5i,Well Battle Royale was much more about the individual students lives leading up to the island less so in the movie since they didnt have the time. The action was made poignant because of their backstories... the fact that they were just teenagers without any training. The fact that children are fighting to the death is kind of less important in The Hunger Games. Like its an initial oh god no but forgotten about pretty quickly. Thats probably because The Hunger Games is kind of a teen action drama whereas Battle Royale is more horrorthriller drama.                          Plus Battle Royale was never These school kids were naughty so now well kill them it was Our populace is becoming less controllable so well install this lottery to keep them fearful. Which is very much what The Hunger Games is aboutthe powerful exerting their control over the weak I might be wrong but I believe the classes usually chosen for the Royale would rarely ever come from welloff areasdeemed impartial lottery. The Hunger Games extrapolates the world of Panem a lot more than Battle Royale describes the state of Japan during the story. The tributes backstories dont really exist but the districts they come from serve to tell us all we need to know about them certain ones have better training or survival skills. It definitely makes for a more colorful and interesting world but it doesnt detract from the fact that the overarching themes governmental control class systems the weak fighting against those with power or the death match lottery are in Battle Royale.                      Yes Battle Royale the movie does a kind of poor job of getting into the depth of the narrative with everyones lives... But the fact that The Hunger Games was more successful at telling the books narrative is just because the way the world is set up kind of does all of that already.                    the rest of the movie is just the crazy action. So way weaker than Hunger Games  the movie may be weaker than Hunger Games but it doesnt detract from the idea that the book The Hunger Games definitely was at least inspired by the book Battle Royale. The Hunger Games was very much written in a way that lends itself for visual storytelling...  the descriptions of the fanciful styles of the Capitol the implicit narratives built into the themes of each of the districts as well as the imagerysymbolism that goes along with them..                 Im not saying The Hunger Games is a Battle Royale ripoff Im saying that refusing to admit that The Hunger Games pulled themes or narrative points from Battle Royale is kind of refusing to see reality. ,Hungergames,dfos2ny,5,t5_2sfjs
11473752,0,t1_dfovxz3,The kids in THG know each other too. Especially the ones closer to the Capitol. And also because of the news coverage. The Battle Royale might not be televised live but there is definitely fanfare surrounding it. The opening of the movie shows all the newsmedia clamoring to see the survivor.                      The items of similarity I referenced are just the thematic elements... not even getting to narrative choices that are direct parallels. ,Hungergames,dfwjmnc,0,t5_2sfjs
