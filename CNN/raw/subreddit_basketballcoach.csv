74110,0,t1_ceml2h4,Would you recommend having them run after getting the rebound or having a few leak out on the break right as it is falling? This question might be too specific to know without seeing the matchup.,basketballcoach,cemv7oo,1,t5_2zpi3
5944002,0,t3_3woays,When I learned the basics of a jumpshot I was taught  points that I dont see included here so I just wanted your take on them. One was to shoot out of a phone booth meaning that I should be able to execute may jumpshot as if I were standing inside a phone booth. This was to make sure that you are jumping straight up and down on the shot and not front to back or side to side. It would also make sure the arm isnt going forward too much on the release but again more of a vertical motion. The second point was that prior to the release of the shot in the proper form on your shooting hand side your toe knee hip elbow and wrist should form a straight line. This would help the point of keeping your toe pointed at the target and keeping your elbow tucked in along with overall balance. Any thoughts on these points?,basketballcoach,cxysedt,1,t5_2zpi3

7408707,0,t3_4gozy4,Im in a different situation  th grade club ball so my focus is  to  years down the line. Anyhow I wanted to share and would really appreciate feedback if you guys have any as Im a new coach.Warmup  min  To start we do something simple but requires teamwork and focus. Just to get them mentally ready. Right now thats  man weave with only  passes full court. Ball cant touch the ground count out loud make  in a row. Should take  or  min but if they fail they do very intense conditioning for  minutes.Part   offensive skill  min  Then we do offensive skill work for  or so min. Always a single move the counter to that move sometimes the counters counter. Left and right side for  moves. I incorporate different kinds of finishes. We do post work maybe  of  or  practices. Would do more postwork and thus footwork but kids just want to shoot s now.Competitive vs for  min. I put them into positions where using the the stuff we just practiced helps a lot. Generally dont see the kids use them though P min intense conditioning then quick water  seconds.Part   Drills  min  Different stuff every week.  Drills for defensive fundamentals like boxing out closing out rotations communication rebounding guardinghedging screens. Right now theyre not ready for schemes or anything. Just want them to be solid fundamentally.  fundamental work. I watch a lot of coaching DVDs from college and pro guys so Im starting to collect an arsenal of defensive drills.  Offensively I dont know of many drills because Ive been almost completely focusing on defense and because I was especially offensively intelligent as a player. I just show them different reads in different situations and have them practice it live in a very controlled setting. Probably do x defensive drills compared to offense although the defensive drills do have an offensive component. I give feedback on offensive decision making there.Conditioning then  sec waterPart   More drills  min  Same as abovePart   Scrimmage  min  Gotta keep it fun.Part   Conditioning and wrap up  min  My kids are out of shape Im not sure if they dont play hard so theyre out of shape or if theyre out of shape so they dont play hard. Id like to cut this part out when they learn to play and practice harder during the rest of practice.,basketballcoach,d2kblga,2,t5_2zpi3
