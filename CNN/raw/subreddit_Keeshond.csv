6528039,0,t3_4519b8,I paid  Canadian for a mutt keeshond. Mutt in that it doesnt have papers and the parents dont have papers and it doesnt have proper keeshond characteristics. He has black feet for example and not enough spectacling. It came from a farm with a family who has  keeshonds and breeds them as a hobby.Here in Canada  to  is the going rate for a purebred anything and even mutts got for .  Also Keeshonds are on the rarer side they are going to be more expensive.That said dogs are expensive and the purchase price is just the start if you cant afford it maybe a dog isnt for you. Youre looking at another  easily in the first year for food supplies and vet visits spaying or neutering.EDIT Looking at your post history says your a pharmacist though? Where at? Ive been one in western Canada for  years now.,Keeshond,czujurn,1,t5_2sjjn
