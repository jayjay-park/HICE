10008043,0,t1_dat52ja,Those are good ideas I just dont think it would work with the amount of people we have on the subreddit currently. But for the pet finder and rescue groups I think if we were to post those they  they would outnumber the other posts and it would change the feeling from a dog focused subreddit towards a dog adoption focused subreddit. But if the community wants that then Ill shift towards changing it.,Jindo,dbc2ri5,1,t5_2v53n
10073232,0,t3_5jzv2n,Personally not a fan of jindo ranch.  There are rescues available most of the time on twodogfarms.com and I am a volunteer for the WA chapter.  They and other rescues devoted to Jindos generally have a stronger sense of the breed and temperament issues but may require a home check and I dont know about Canadian possibilities.  You might also honestly look into the other Asian breeds that may be easier to acquire where you are if you are set on the type more than the specific breed.  California has the most rescue and cross bred Jindos in the states if you are looking for an immediate animal.,Jindo,dbkkbse,2,t5_2v53n
