9918768,0,t3_5he6f7,This is a very interesting scene. It certainly drew me in. The descriptions are good but could be better in some of the delivery at the beginning. I would add some more tactile details. The roughness of the rope the glare of the sun off the water etc. The timeline seems a bit squiffy too. Saying one evening makes it sounds like more than the one or two  max? days she would have survived this. Just my opinion you can take it or leave. All in all I like this and would want to read more. Good job!,Escritoire,db0fvhp,1,t5_3gug8
