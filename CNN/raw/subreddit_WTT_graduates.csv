Combine that with Australian Shepherds tendency to be stranger shy and you have a disaster.  Training any kind of anxiety or reactive behavior is a long road. rDogtraining has been really helpful in giving me a place to start but getting a trainer is what has really helped me.  I guess I need more hands on instruction. ,WTT_graduates,d3di5bs,2,t5_3eo5u
7681707,0,t1_d3fcvim,I havent been in a hike in so long it sounds amazing. We talked online for a couple weeks because he was moving houses but our first date lasted so long he got a parking ticket. And he had the foresight to save it so he still has that memento from our first date. ,WTT_graduates,d3fd3ex,2,t5_3eo5u

Sort through clothes and store the ones that are currently too small with a pipe dream that someday they will fit again.Some of these seem like they could be really great TWW projects to keep yourself busy!,WTT_graduates,d601gex,2,t5_3eo5u
8696451,0,t1_d6rsc31,Thanks! My husband just started traveling for work in the last couple of years. Having him present at big meetings across the country tends to help his project continue to be funded. Its usually only for a few days and maybe every other month but this month its been twice.

8838324,0,t3_513x0r,Im at CD but still far from O if I follow my recent patterns around CD. Ive been kind of detached from TTC recently between the long cycle and thinking I might have bacterial vaginosis. Those symptoms have disappeared so now Im not sure if I should still see a doctor or just go along with my life.  We did BD yesterday but it didnt feel like trying just because its still so early. Early ha!Ive been drinking raspberry leaf though. Well see if that changes anything?Also its my husbands birthday!! We have plans to see a stand up comic so that should be fun. Im just kind of sad because I had hopes of getting a BFP last cycle and revealing it today. Not that I couldve waited this long. PBiggest fear... Man. I have all the fears. PPD. Not liking babies. My relationship  my husband can get standoffish and grumpy when stressed and I get critical andor avoidant. So thatll take active work to overcome with a baby in tow. ,WTT_graduates,d7a8pfq,1,t5_3eo5u
8873845,0,t3_51pwaw,Onion I am sick and worried it will kill our chances this cycle. We were trying to SMEP the crap out of this cycle but missed the second time and have to try again tonight but I dont know if I will feel up to it.

9396256,0,t3_599k4z, dpo testing Friday morning with FMU. I hope I dont forget like I did last cycle. It sucks when you remember midstream that you were going to test! Haha.

9563212,0,t1_d9rre7l,I love the name Finnegan! Finn MacCool  is a badass Gaelic hero. We  both really like the name Logan James for a boy ... and no shame its a superhero reference. But it doesnt sound like one unless youre also a nerd. ,WTT_graduates,d9rv16t,1,t5_3eo5u

11736160,0,t1_dgq0nvz,Some people have really vague CM. Like to the point that its not even that great of a tracking tool. So I wouldnt be hard on yourself for not being able to identify each type exactly. ,WTT_graduates,dgqbni8,1,t5_3eo5u
11784700,0,t1_dgvdf75,My doc prefers a lot of labs in first trimester and doesnt mind waiting to have them all done at once  because Im a new patient at this office they have to run the usuals like an STD screen AC a marker for diabetes blood type and counts metabolic panel etc.For my sore belly I didnt drink enough water before my scan putting my uterus and baby in a weird position. The tech to compensate had to push a lot harder on my abdomen than she normally would have.Baby is great! Rolls spins waves and kicks seen on ultrasound. Kid is doing headstands in there lol,WTT_graduates,dgvu1uk,2,t5_3eo5u
