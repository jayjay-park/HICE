11545937,0,t3_64rifs,I think its about to get a lot more real now that the code has been sped up and all the robots are now awake. Also I think were going to see more of that dark side now that niska knows humans arent willing to accept them also I think well see a lot more robots like Hester because theres always bad people in a group. I personally loved season  this is by far one of my top  favorite shows right now. ,Humans_tv,dg4qfum,2,t5_393ob
