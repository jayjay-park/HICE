Plus you get to check out the arcade and i know thats where i spent most of my time in sc. at  kbs that is about  megs an hour or about  gigs a day so for the full  gig install of sc thats  days max at that speed Less if its anything faster.grab this launcher Its amazing will make it so you hardly ever need to actually type in your login details and if you ever play other blizzard games would make launching them easy as well.,starcraft,cefe8br,2,t5_2qpp6

Admins work best as partners in large jobs. The buddy system works great. One guy takes care of the stream and the other takes care of the bracket. The one guy doing stream stuff helps alleviate the other work during high loads.  Takes about  months of constant work to be able to manage  people at once. Currently I would trust a few others with a large operation without needing supervision mostly individuals I either trained or helped train.Edit By saying managing  people I also mean running a stream and inviting castersplayers and setting a scoreboard whilst maintaining the bracket.

46602,0,t3_1ulngi,I have only been playin sc for about  years and I know I have been making improvements finally i can beat the very hard AI easily. But I cant for the life of me get into silver again. I made it there once or twice before but now I feel stuck in bronze. I can beat the odd gold player and destroy the bronze ppl I have played against. However I feel its wierd when I am in bronze playin a guy in bronze who was once in platinum and this happens all the time. If I check the players who I lose too they are either platinum or diamond. So why stick me in bronze forever? My point is why have a ladder system with ranks when they dont mean anything. Like ifIim in bronze forever thats cool but at least put me against other player of my own skill level and not against ppl who are a league or THREE above mine or even the highest league I have ever made it too. Lastly I just wanna say it really ruins the fun of the laddering. When u can get  wins and be stuck in bronze. Heres an idea make silver mostly for active decent player and have bronze be for ppl starting out and for the really less skilled ppl this way the leagues actually mean something unlike now where they are basically meaning less MMR is everything. This way decent players dont start in bronze and beat up on new players right away. You could ease them into it more easily. Just a thought.,starcraft,cejqil5,1,t5_2qpp6

57467,0,t1_cekfwre,Cant believe such a stupid comment is upvoted. If  of pro players were Terrans it would be because Terran is a much shittier race even though the  is winning half of their games. Think of it this way lets say there are two ways of playing v basketball. Either you play normally Protoss or you can only play with one hand Terran. People choosing to play normally would make up the great majority of the NBA . Now lets say Lebron James decides to play only with one hand Terran. He is considered an average player winning  of his v games. In this scenario is basketball balanced? Obviously not because only one player is talented enough to be able to play at the best level with only one hand. He is still at a very heavy disadvantage compared to the players playing with two hands.Now Im not saying this is actually the case with Terran and Protoss not at all. But the fact that  of players in GM are Protoss and only  are Terrans is still a bit concerning. Why? Because Terran players didnt magically disapear. In fact across all leagues the races are distributed pretty evenly. Then why all of a sudden there are  more Protoss than Terran in Grandmaster league? Because lowGM terrans became highmaster and highmaster protosses became lowGM. Why? I dont pretend I know the answer but it definitely is something that is worthy of a discussiom.,starcraft,cekz1fy,2,t5_2qpp6

65068,0,t3_1uun2p,GM here I bought starcraft . year after the release and I was REALLY scared of the game itself. I remember not understanding anything making some marines and getting totally crush in vs with the other guy raging at me saying I was the worst player hes ever seen. From that point I never played a single game of v since I was too scared of it the only games I played were marine arena and some team games where I had developped a build of  rax stim timing in v with my friend.After watching a ton of casts strategy guides and streams I felt like I was ready to play vs  year after I got the game.I got placed into platinum and I thought I was so good that I could get masters in  more games. But I unfortunatly got demoted to gold. After this I kept playing a lot and got promoted back to plat the season after then diamond for only one season where I played around  games because I had developed ladder anxiety but I was playing in peep modes all the time and also practicing with my master friends  I got lucky to have these guys to wreck me hard and make me learn a lot from it . in the  summer I finally got masters and I instantly joined a team wich helped me improve a lot more than I would have improved without a team.Since then  Ive been playing pretty much everyday around  games and  a season and I got grandmasters on the november th.Best tipsDo not stop playing. When you have free time just play ladder even if its one game or two it makes the difference.Watch your replays you will learn so much from them and you will not make the mistakes that you did previously.Have some friends to play the game with you if are looking for them join a clan or add me  koreanair .  ,starcraft,celu6bp,3,t5_2qpp6

119833,0,t1_cerwi13,Alright You can get most of if not all of the stuff you need off of amazon or your local art store. Sculpey You can grab a tool set like this one from amazon as well or you can shop around for something that works for you though. I started off just using a toothpick and my hands. The wire armature is really important and is what holds up your piece. You wont end up using all of it for one piece keep in mind. Youll want to wrap some tinfoil around that to give the clay something to stick to. I forgot to take a picture of that step unfortunately. I just use basic acrylic paint to finish it off. A set like that will last you for quite a while though. All in all thats about . to start off. If youre looking for some more stuff I also use a clay press to flatten out the armor. It makes it easier to cut shapes out of a perfectly flat surface of clay as well as making it uniformly smooth. Let me know if you have any more questions. Id be happy to answer them.

Look moving around and a kinda back and forth game is nice. But with the previous meta we had that too with . even more action and . micro. Bio is in every way more entertaining too watch. Another problem with mech is that it is so much easier to play. Just looking at production cycles alone you need to have over  times the apm as a bio player since for the cost of  tanks you can build more than  Marines and  Marauders. Then additionally the build time of MM is less than rd of the tank build time. That was the macro. Add the lack of micro necessary and you have... Terran Protoss. Surely exactly what we need.A year or two ago I played mech vs Zerg every game. It was disgustingly easy but after playing mostly protoss until then a rather nice transition compared to the switch to bio I made later on.

Maru doesnt do that every TvP he actually does a lot of kiting.Give me some fucking video evidence where Maru kites against templar and colossi give me.gt And the reason for the massive complains and balance whine are because of the design in the matchup. Its very unforgiving for the terran and makes you feel like bashing your head against a brick wall.Yeah its fucking unforgiving if you play it like a fucking retard and kite when you shouldnt. And anyone who actually tries to improve can watch a couple of progames to realize that you shouldnt kite. But the chronic fucking condition of this fucking community is to by all means not ask What can I do better? but rather ask How can I whine balance on reddit so I can continue to delude myself the reason Im losing is the game rather than an elementary mistake a fucking child can fix if you let yourself to.Not kiting and stnading in an arc isnt hard you just have to know when to do it and allow yourself to actually open up to the mistakes in your play rather than narcissistically failing to admit whatever problems that you hav ein the matchup may be your own flaws.,starcraft,cexf6qn,1,t5_2qpp6

169989,0,t1_cexlbea,Im sensing sarcasm but Ill respond anyway. SCBW was able to do all these things without streaming so no Twitch it had ZERO foreign financial backing so literally no MLG NASL Homestory Dreamhack Red Bull LAN etc. We had one thing. WCG if you made it you find a way there you find a hotel to stay in and eventually they send you enough money to compensate it all.  There was no streaming of this tournament you refreshed the bracket page when you heard someone was playing. If we wanted to watch starcraft we stayed up until am to watch a laggy p stream that was entirely in Korean. We didnt have shows like State of the Game Unfiltered Live On Three etc.  The last year or two before SC came out Day started his own show but other than that there was nothing. And BW still lasted something like  years. SC has TONS of money being pumped into it by lots of companies trying to cashin on the ESports market. You have tons of web shows tons of streamers tons of tournaments all of course in perfect High Definition. And the game is dying after only  maybe  years?  That is what I mean when I say perfect blueprint.  BW had nearly every disadvantage imaginable and still managed to accomplish all of this and last for nearly  years. SC has nearly every advantage imaginable and is dying after only a few.So why the anger towards Blizzard? Because they had the opportunity to take a golden egg BW shine it up and release the best possible RTS imaginable and they didnt. They tore a  Mustang apart to make a barely functioning tricycle.  Some people enjoy tricycles and thats fine but thats only because they dont know what used to be there.  Take it from someone who knew what used to be there Blizzard fucked up hard with SC. ,starcraft,cexsme6,2,t5_2qpp6

178538,0,t1_ceyi0et,Well said. To me the protoss race is a bore to play with and against. In diamond and masters league protoss play is extremely methodical. All you gotta do is learn a kickass build tailored to every map then wait for the opponent to make a mistake.On the contrary Zerg is a read and react race. Scouting is so crucial every single little clue the opponent reveals you must get a hold of! The ability to scout directly correlates to your chances of survival and the amount of time you have to counter cannon bunker rushes cloak air build etc. You are always making major changes to your build in order to not just counter but also to survive.I play terran mostly and I find Terranes are extremely versatile but is just a midway race always just halfassd with anything a jack of all trades. You can make drastic changes to your build midgame in relatively good speed and still not fall too behind but you will be a few steps behind in tech and upgrades. No wonder cheesiness is so wide spread. ,starcraft,ceyrqku,2,t5_2qpp6

When two casters are on equal footing in that regard it is all personal preferencethe viewer. Some people like Artosis some like Apollo. The casters cant cast against each other to see who wins.

The Zerg production however is half the map away. So the Protoss production is closer than the Zerg one. Not good for the Zerg not good at all. If there was a way to beat the allin by strategy Zergs would have figured out how to do that long ago as is the fate of every allin. Every allin but one.

To a Megalisk maybe basicly the same but more health and the fast burrowcharge ability. Or some sort of wolflike creature that jumpsor burrows into the battle from affar and as it fights it pushes units in its surroundings away banelingsplash radius cooldowned so it only happens once a fight. They are also a fast unit tier  but not all that expensive cuz of the throwaway mechanic and upon death they release broodlings. Or maybe get rid of neural parasite and reintroduce infest Broodwar queen ability to the infestor. Or maybe something like they showed in a demo video of HOTS way back in alpha with a bunkermonster of some sort You infest a bunker which then turns into a high health high armor monster that fights for you briefly.

Of course the sight range would make blink allins a lot weaker but it would change PvP and give a lot less options in the early game.  For every change that I was against I gave another option to tackle the problem instead. The only exception being the widow mine. Theres not a lot of good mech players out there so its hard for everyone to judge how good widow mines are but mixed in with tanks and vikings where they constantly snipe your obs is really hard to play against.EDIT  gt Vote.

And not because its skillless but because you cant tell players apart from each other.If I saw a TvT of BW and it would immediately be apparent who is who. For instance anyone well versed in BW could tell apart if the player is Fantasy or Flash. They both had  esque TvT at the end of BW but they had a completely different approach. Not just how and when they attacked but how they positioned their tanks.If you see a protoss playing a high level PvT you immediately know if its Stork Bisu or maybe Best.If you watched Jaedongs ZvZ  winrate for the last  years of BW so much for a coin flip match up. Youd know him by his perfect play in a  hatch vs  pool situation and muta micro.Bisus PvZ need I say more?If you watch SC players better players just do the same things but some do them slightly better than others.

They were using WoL strategies but the pros didnt have to worry about salarycareers and were just capable of showing us their best games.So in order not be arbitrary I just prefer to see no cheesesearlyish allins for these showmatches.

The difference is that in dota you tab inbetween individual units of the same type. So if you cast an EMP with a ghost youd have to tab to get to the nd ghost in your selection when casting another EMP.  In SC you use tab to switch between groups of different unit types. Casting a spell automatically chooses the caster closest in range with mana. Dota style  caster in the group is highlighted and will be the only one responding to the cast command despite you having X amount of casters selected.,starcraft,cflrsr1,7,t5_2qpp6

424097,0,t1_cfon1s4,No idea who you are but you are not posting from the account I replied to.In case you are the same person are you for real? I call you out for being unnessecarily harsh on a prominent community figure without presenting anything to back your claims up with until this post and you reply with a long winded philosophical speech about the bleak circumstances of human nature and how pessimism equals realism? Really?I wasnt aware that the concept of being a jerk on reddit is generally a bad idea since it will lead to a less inviting community was such an alien concept to you that you had to delve into the dark depths of the human psyche to come up with a justification for your attitude. You can think optimism is a shell people surround themselves with to protect them from the objectively harsh and cruel world we live in as much as you like. Fact remains that a lot of people in the Starcraft community prefer that the level of discussion lies somewhere above that guy is a childish jerk because he balance whines on stream sometimes. If you want to see what excess negativity and needless bashing does to an internet community look no further than certain parts of TL.net. In fact if you prefer a community where people are at each others throats Id recommend you to seek refuge somewhere is one of the SCIIbashing discussions in the BW subsection which should have a nice selection of angry bitter and resentful people none of which appear to be enjoying their participation in the community in the slightest.Your anger at the very notion that Artosis should get special treatment because hes famous is also really misguided I never claimed that he should and the fact that you dont give a shit about famous people interacting makes it look as if youre completely oblivious to what being part of an online community entails. It doesnt matter what you think in this case there are LOADS of people who are interested in hearing what Artosis or other prominent community members have to say. Why do you think a player or caster can do an AMA and get hundreds of replies? Why do you think people want to read a blog post from Morrow about game design rather than reading one written by someone else? How do you think someone like Artosis became famous in the first place? Answer Because people care about him and all the other members of the community who have put more time and effort into the game and have more insight than the rest of us. Artosis isnt liked just because hes famous hes liked because unlike you or me hes spent countless hours trying to make this community better.And you are angry about the Hubris in assuming people want to listen to them? Are you fucking kidding me? I dont think Ive ever actually heard him say anything to that effect but Artosis could say something like a shit ton of people want to listen to me AND HED BE RIGHT. So would TLO. Its not Hubris ITS AN ACCURATE EVALUATION OF REALITY. If you dont want to listen fine but a shit ton of people do. Deal with it.In general the fact that we have players casters tournament organisers and other members of the community interacting with the rest of us is a MASSIVE advantage. A community without the involvement of people who have some kind of actual insight would be much less appealing to most people and wouldnt be able to attract as many potential new fans of the game either. People arent just here to talk about Starcraft they are also here to listen to people with insight talk about Starcraft. You may not personally enjoy it but that doesnt mean there are people who arent The idea that we should be even harsher in critizising public figures in the community is pretty stupid considering how some community members who would otherwise take part in discussions are actively avoiding a lot of community interaction due to the intense scrutiny they are put under due to their fame. Just recently Totalbiscuit  deleted his redditaccount and stopped interacting with his subreddit almost entirely since the stress it caused made him concerned for his mental and physical health.  In the light of something like that your complaints that public figures in the community arent critizised enough seem completely off the mark. You can yell about this just being my opinion as much as youd like but if our goal is to create a community where more people can enjoy themselves and attract newcomers your attitude towards it is definitely worse. And even if you dont believe thats true even if you dont personally care about wellknown community members interacting is that really the kind of person you want to be? The kind of person who drives people away from interacting because they face too much unwarranted shitthrowing from random users on message boards?I mean yes negativity is bad is only my opinion and the opinion of a shit ton of other people but its an opinion thats based on a lot of observations of the community what makes it grow what makes it more enjoyable to interact with what brings people in and what scares them away. Having a Starcraftscene where negativity is king and everyone complains about everything would perhaps make you and a handful of others enjoy it more but trust me when I say it would make it worse for so many more. It would in the long run be detrimental to the Starcraft scene. And if cant agree that that would be a bad thing I dont think theres anything else for us to discuss.As for Artosis specifically its nice to see that you are finally backing your claims up with some actual examples but why did you think bringing stuff from the BWera up would help your case? He used to rage a lot  years ago so yeah total jerk. Your criticism of him accusing people of cheating is very valid but theres still a long step from not wanting to analyze your losses to being a whiny child. Again pointing out specific things you think he did wrong is fine but theres still a big difference between saying hes doing something stupid and he is stupid.If you want to reply again it would be nice if you could read my entire post and reply to more of it than just a few selected quotes of which some are taken slightly out of context.Also as a sidenote Im not asserting my opinion as fact I just havnt been adding an IMO at the end of each sentence since I assumed that the fact that some of the things Im writing are opinions should be obvious from context. I guess I was wrong.And as another sidenote unless Im mistaken you linked a Wikipedia article that describes a controversial hypothesis that may only hold relevance in a few special situations not something theres a scientific consensus agreeing upon as a desciption of how we percieve reality. to quote the article Some have argued that the evidence is not more conclusive because there is no standard for reality the diagnoses are dubious and the results may not apply to the real world. Since there is no consistent and valid reality standard to compare perception to we can never be too sure whose perceptions are accurate. Because many studies rely on selfreport of depressive symptoms the diagnosis of depression in these studies may not be valid as selfreports are known to often be biased necessitating the use of other objective measures. Due to most of these studies using designs that do not necessarily approximate realworld phenomena the external validity of the depressive realism hypothesis is unclear. There is also concern that the depressive realism effect is merely a byproduct of the depressed person being in a situation that agrees with his or her negative bias.Also even assuming hypothesis would be confirmed it refers to depressed individuals not necessarily negativity as a general concept.Im not a psychologist and havnt done any studies but I have more experience with depressed individuals than I would like and as far as Ive seen  their assessments of a situation are often unrealistic and more importantly not constructive. Kind of like your attitude in that last respect. I dont believe that your attitude is more real and even if it were if it doesnt help make the Starcraft scene into something better for more people than yourself and a few others with your preferences Im not interested.,starcraft,cfoq0sw,1,t5_2qpp6

435041,0,t3_1z1u0l,I dont think people should hate all Protoss players like they seem to. Until you get very very highly rated this is just a game and people have the right to enjoy it however they damn well please.Blizzard on the other hand have a certain responsibility to the playerbase and professionals who earn their living from this game. I have to wonder what StarCraft would be like if Protoss simply didnt exist.. because its gotten to a point now where the atrocious design is evident. Terran has always been since vanilla the best race of StarCraft in terms of balance. Everything clicks together so logically floating your buildings to swap addons. Biological units have lots of useful upgrades. Mechanical units have incredible diversity. There are multiple paths a Terran can take in a game ranging from mobile harassing play to slowly sieging up an entire side of the map to complete proxy aggression.You cant hold Protoss in terms of design up to Terran and even see them as from the same game. Nothing fits about Protoss the way it does with Terran and Zerg. Its like Blizzard tried to give it all the opportunities that Terran have for the sake of balance but forgot to actually make it logical. Theres something missing Protoss build orders are never as clear compare  poolCC or  rax to ImmortalSentry or Blink Stalker allin. The reason that Protoss builds are less defined like that is because Protoss lacks completion or wholeness mechanics like what Terran has with liftoff or Zerg has with larvae spawning  and countless other Terran and Zerg nuances which provide such a logical flow to their build orders that they can be refined by Korean geniuses to the point of absolute perfection look no further than that Taeja vs. Innovation game  of WCS Season  for evidence of this. Protoss has only had this to a very small extent from people like PartinG with their ImmortalSentry. Even then builds like those can have a totally different outcome based on one or two forcefields. Refined builds that a Terran might do have a completely different outcome based on literally having one less Marine at a precise time. Therein lies the problem its like Blizzard realized that Terran and Zerg are so much more accurate with their timings and simply gave up on toss. Figured they needed a way of keeping them in the game so they handed them a mechanic in this case forcefields which solves the problem on a surface level. On a deeper level though those little incongruencies bubble up until theyre ready to burst  and this comes while Terran and Zerg are closer to figuring out the game in a Brood War sense than they ever were with WoL. Then the bubbles do burst Protoss players in studying the game like a Terran or Zerg might find some little cheapy tactic which helps them win they get satisfied and they abuse it. What this does is completely devalue StarCraft as a game because Protoss simply is not as polished a race as Terran and Zerg. Their mechanics like warpin and forcefields have clearly not been thought out by Blizzard as much as Terran and Zerg mechanics and often they result in entirely unpredictable games. An unpredictable game can of course be exciting but it is infinitely moreso when the reason that its unpredictable is how the players are handling their units and resources far less so when the reason is simply that the mechanics of the game at a fundamental level dont fit in or make sense in the context. People will probably say that I am complaining too much that cheese makes a game interesting. This is true but Im not just talking about cheese. For example take Arthur vs. Bomber today. That was a fifteenminute Blink allin. By definition it really shouldnt be called a cheese because it took so incredibly long. Yet because of strange mechanics in the way the Protoss race was thought out the game simply unfolded that way. Not because of how Bomber reacted to the build or how Arthur followedup. Simply because of the very first decision that Arthur made his build order.Its a little saddening because Terran and Zerg really do embody everything that is beautiful about an RTS  Terran especially. It almost makes me wonder if the game would be far further along if Terran and Zerg didnt have to spend time figuring out a race that in its current shape isnt compatible with StarCraft and I honestly think that the answer is yes. Its regrettable because Protoss was pretty great in StarCraft I. Its hard to envision a StarCraft without that badass spiritualwarriorlaser beams race. Thats why I really hope Blizzard completely redesigns Protoss. I know that they wont but the best thing they could possibly do is hire a bunch of progamers and coaches and rebuild the race from scratch the right way.,starcraft,cfpuuze,7,t5_2qpp6

JD would win in standard games but the way SC is designed means he didnt win. The better player didnt win. Its a competitive game. The better player is supposed to win.You could make an argument that SOME cheese is necessary for viewership because apparently people dont want back and forth interesting games all the timethough interestingly enough those are always the greatest games of sc. But were not at that point. Were at the point where cheese is absolutely rampant in tournaments and even more so on ladder. Literally almost every game I play sans zvt is against some kind of allin.Id say thats a BIG reason for the games decline as of late. Its simply not fun to macro for    minutes and then.... oops theres shit in my base. oops there are DTs. oops proxy gate. Its not interesting or fun to lose like that.

499864,0,t1_cfwwa9p,While I totally agree with you about the fact that most players dont understand the concept of the metagame and how to really play starcraft I think you are conflating balance and design. What you dont understand or at least what is not coming across in your point is that this is not an issue of the community growing the game from the rails that blizzard has set for us.Yes people are too quick to demand things be changed and fail to take responsibility for their part in the meta game but the issue here is that people cant play protoss the way they want to namely with tanky gateway units that are worth the investment cost. That is the only argument that has been put up here the other ones you posted are strawmen desinged to demagogue the argument. The argument isnt that Warpgate FF mechanics hold the game back from its true potential its that it makes protoss gateway units suck and consequentially makes its players rely on bandaids zone control and aoe and that people find this emphatically unfun to play. Whether that is a legitimate argument is debatable but dont come in here telling people they just need to shake up the metagame. It will not work. Protoss tier . units literally do not have high enough stats for the expansions in thought you seem to be advocating for and you clearly do not understand what the point of an argument against the design of a unit is about.,starcraft,cfx36fm,3,t5_2qpp6

I honestly dont see why zerg or protoss would ever expand there as their third. For terran going turtle mode that might be fine tho. The agressive third option also has a really long reinforcement path so that even seems pretty rough to hold and expoing in a line would still be equally aggressive and more defensible.The biggest reason I would prefer a circle syndrome version is that mirrored maps tend to encourage split map games and imo those type of games are super boring.,starcraft,cfy7nsx,1,t5_2qpp6

When has starcraft been different? During the Hots Beta? Where a new build would win many games?

You see top Korean pros RARELY complaining about the other races and go on to say they need to practice harder on the match up. I have done my complaining about Protoss but Im just tired of doing it anymore. Metas shift and the game changes way too often for whining to actually be credible.

I say this because it has already been shown that Polt style  rax with good scouting is effective at holding blink allins even though im not saying terrans should do that every time just in case there is a blink allin but im basically trying to suggest what i think could lead to an alternative opening that could still viably defend a blink allin,starcraft,cg3mh40,2,t5_2qpp6

You will lose a bit more than you win at first but it will quickly gravitate to a  win rate. You can dip your feet in with the starter edition but matchmaking requires you to get the game proper.

BUT when they want to restructure and rebrand upon reentry because Starcraft is in our blood they will be begging and pleading the same exact people whom they snubbed during closing for help with some great up on the mountain top speech. Thats why it should be a story. How many people in Starcraft retire then change their minds next week? Thats why they should have the courtesy and BALLS explain beforehand not after the fact. Thats not business like but you want to be in business. If you know anything about it then you know how that goes.

Blizzard did awsome job since the diablo debacle and only improved since then.But blizzard wont make another expansion for sc than lotV. Campaigne games doesnt sell good. Their shareholders complain about games like sc diablo and so on. They want free to play titles where u can have a lot of microtransactions. There are many people who pay a lot more money to ftp titles than a general game. And ftp titles generally cost less to make than a campaigne where u need an excellent ai story and movies.If they make another expansion it will be a free to play sc version. I even think they will make sc work as a free to play multiplayer title. With sick inovations once they made heroes of the storm. They also plan heroes to be a competitive title and they said they will add evrything what it needs to be competitive ! EDIT They said in an interview that the campaigne for lotv is almost finished !

703908,0,t1_cgk4ke2,The stupid part is as fun as I think this game is and anyone who plays it will recognize where my name comes from. Competitive Hearthstone is a complete joke. The game was designed to be casual from the ground up and it is. Hearthstone tournaments never run a qualifier and always just invite popular streamers and those popular streamers are often not even top ranked constructed. They know damned well that if they ran a qualifier a completely different group of people would qualify each time. Its a card game the luck of the draw alone is a huge RNG factor on top of that Blizzard decided to add a tonne of RNG to the game to make it more fun. Between similarly skilled opponents games are for the most part decided by luck of the draw.Artosis is a Hearthstone pro only because his name was known already within esports and he became a popular streamer and is invited to all these tournaments as a consequence. Same with Trump Kripp Savjz Nox and all the other current HS pros. Hearthstone tournaments simply continue to invite the same group of players over and over again. People are really trying to force HS into being an esport because Blizzard made it.Edit Thats not to say that all these people arent a lot better than I or anything. Obviously Artosis is good at this game but not good as in absolute top level good that a StarCraft progamer is.,starcraft,cgkacdf,48,t5_2qpp6

Roachbane is just so easy to work into a build once you identify an agressively timed lair for mutalisks and its so crushingly powerful. Maps like Habitation promote roach play because the gold allows for income to be skewed in favor of minerals which doesnt benefit a muta player. The spore crawler change does come into play because Roach openers provide vastly superior economy to mutalisk openers in the early mid game. Investment into spores needs to just be extremely minimal because now they can in fact  shot mutalisks so from the risk in actually getting to muta to the map pool to the actual benefit in opening toward the composition you actually want instead of transitioning to roach with muta wherein youre behind on upgradessecondary tech.,starcraft,cgl7il0,1,t5_2qpp6

730391,0,t3_22iylo,If you are adamant about backlighting the Shine III is pretty much the best that you can get. The build quality is excellent and there are tons of backlighting options. I believe that it also follows a standard keycap layout  so you can easily replace the caps as they wear down you may have to get backlight compatible caps though.I have not used KeyCool keyboards though. I dont own a Shine III but I had a brief opportunity to type on one. The board is going to feel a lot more sturdy when you type on it. Compared to the BW Ultimate bottoming out is going to feel and sound different on the Shine III  almost like the keycap is running into a piece of sheet metal rather than a piece of plastic. They are both plate mounted so I guess the difference is the quality of the board and keycaps. If you are looking for compact keyboards I would also suggest a Poker II with backlighting. The KeyCool  does not look like it follows a standard keycap layout  you may regret that purchase when the keycaps get really worn and you are looking for replacements.I have a Filco MJ Leopold FCRT Leopold M DasKeyboard Ultimate Topre Realforce u and Quickfire Rapid  if you are curious about any of those models I would be able to give a better explanation.

Every single study like it makes similar conclusions places the start of the supposed decline at some arbitrary age and every time gaming journalists repeat the findings unquestioningly.The problem with every single one of these studies is that they fail absolutely to account for lifestyle differences the single most obvious and common sense factor. Players in their s live much more demanding lives than students and teenagers have less time to commit to finding efficient build orders will tend to play more casually even where hour commitments are equal will prioritise the game less than somebody without children a job etc etc. The list goes on and other. It then only stands to reason that if you were to profile bronze league by age it would peak early and decline shortly after the age at which people typically enter the fulltime workforce as in .Every one of these studies is useless because the variables they fail to account for are huge.

As Ive said before I barely ever play versus live opponents this doesnt affect me very much except as a spectator.Also Im not sure I contradicted myself. The first point is that MMA had to do scouting early in the game and try to spot everything MC was doing because anything MC did that went undetected would overrun MMA.The second point was part of MMAs answer to zealot and stalker pushes would be some Widow Mines. However the widow mines get sniped very easily thanks to MCs ability to field mobile scouts. Those scouts also counter MMAs ghosts. The presence of those scouts seems like an integrated part of the P army and is always in effect where the T player has to use active scouting with his scans and can be blind for long periods of time.Thanks for your reply.,starcraft,cgrzb02,1,t5_2qpp6

That word continues to be  not a financially viable platform.gt a great vocal group of Windows users who were gamers and they said the only thing keeping them from Linux was the fact some games SC for instance werent on the platform natively. Some of us went over anyway and used WINE even with it being a heap of shit in a lot of cases and now games are coming now to the platform we want to useYou should take a minute and think about this and what it means from a business perspective. Youre giving them money regardless of whether or not they support Linux as a platform. If you genuinely want to see Linux emerge as a contender stop doing that.

What higher level players do is that they identify them selves with parts of the game they are good at. For instance if you think of your self as someone who has really solid macro and good multitasking then you dont get that angry when you lose as your selfesteem didnt take as big of a hit as long as your macro was solid. So I would recommend that you try to write down your strenghts and weaknesss. Next step is that you make skillbased goals based on your strenghtsweaknesss. E.g. if your macro is lackluster then you can write down that you want to be able to consitently have an SQ of above  or you could just say you want average unspent of below  in a normal game. So even if you lose you wont get that angry if you managed to have a low average unspent ressource after a game. Relating this to myself after coming back to Sc after a  months break and trying to get back into master league I feel my builds arent as refined as they need to be so in games where I am able to execute the opening parts of the game flawless  but fail later on in the game  I can still feel some type of satisfaction from that game. ,starcraft,cgvq0zb,1,t5_2qpp6

Killing a turtleSH player before they reach critical mass of SH isnt something only top koreans can do. Its a skill that you can develop by trying strategies similar to the pros then analyzing losses for ways to improve.

826161,0,t3_23kwai,Ok brace for impact for my favorite ZvP cheese.  I do  Overlord  Gas  Pool  Overlord  Ling Speed  Queen  Par of Lings.  Use the lings to scout.  If he early expands then the cheese kicks in.  If not take a second base and flood it with workers.  Make lings for map control and keep P on one base.  Anyway if P fast exapands cancel ling speed and go for lair.  Make a proxy hatch somewhere close to his base.  Drone up until saturating a single base with two gases.  Its important to use lings to keep P from scouting.  As soon as Lair finishes Infestation Pit.  At proxy base make a queen a drone or two and Swarmhosts.  If done right you can have a Swarmhost picking at the nat really early.  As you keep making Swarmhosts eventually P will be overwhelmed.  I usually saturate my Proxy base as I get the chance to.  Also get an early hive to get vipers.  Its pretty silly to just have  SHs and a viper or two picking a Protoss apart.,starcraft,cgy6pgk,2,t5_2qpp6

959943,0,t1_chbcfg4,Sorry it took me so long to respond but you asked so nicely Ill leave a reply. Basically what this comes down to is why BW allowed for OP armiesunits and why SC does not allow the same. In an asymmetrical economy created by BWs mining scalibility it is expected for one side to be able to produce more units while the other can have more cost efficient engagements. This creates an incentive for the player with the better economy to attack constantly whitling down the opposing force while limiting bases your opponents bases expanding across the map yourself. Sounds similar to SC but having  bases all mining at the same time was standard in BW but pointless in SC since players could never have enough workers to make it worth it. This is why Flash said the supply cap should be made .   This is also why mech TvP worked in BW but not in SC. Mech is slow and immobile but extremely powerful in a head on engagement. Because a turtling mech player will always have a similar economy to an expanding toss player its impossible to have mech be balanced while still winning in a straight up engagement. Its a catch  slow and immobile armies cannot trade efficiently in symmetrical economies without being OP. In BW toss would just throw unit after unit trying to break the turtling terran before they crept across the map and took the toss out expanding behind their push. It meant constant action. So while its all theory crafting I really dont see it as much of a coincidence that SC never really became that big in Korea especially compared to BW although theres many many more reasons for that including UMS mapssocial not just game design. ,starcraft,chdekm0,1,t5_2qpp6

It wouldnt affect the midgame too much and in the lategame it would definitely give zergs some staying power vs. voids and skytoss like you mention.

1032512,0,t1_chlb22p,I think you could say that luck depends on the point of view. Player A has a certain amount of uncontrolled circumstances he gets thrown at him and player B has another amount of uncontrolled circumstances het gets thrown at him. The luck factor of each player is decided by the amount and outcome of those uncontrolled scenarios.I would say I am unlucky because I didnt weigh the chances of me dying. If I knew there was poison and I drank it I made the conscious controlled decision that I knew the outcome was Im going to die. I didnt make this decision to die I made the decision to drink from the bottle which then branched out into the certain outcome of me going to die. As long as I dont weighknow the possible outcomes of a scenario theres a  percent chance of either outcome if you look at my decision and thus my point of view or  in  possible outcomes etc.. If I dont suspect there to be any other outcome than nothing happening because the bottle is just a common bottle then Id say my decision was made with the  certainty that nothing would happen.Im not sure if this is a valid way of looking at it statistically speaking but I think luck is something that is human and exists because of our own imperfection. I could walk down the stairs right now in the same way everytime and walking in that fashion will always result in me not tripping. But if the scenario has changed slightly maybe the stairs are wet and I havent noticed this because well I dont notice every single detail I could still trip.About the unmicroed battle while the units move the same way in every exact same situation there always are many small differences between similar situations. Im talking about the exact positioning of each unit. The fact that all units form a perfect half circle with no units in the back trying to squeeze in is lucky unmicroed outcome.You could say that if you send the same units in the same manner each time they will move the exact same but you cannot control that deep of a branch because that means your waypoint was the exact same the units were positioned the exact same way before you gave them their waypoint maybe things like the presence of creep if you play zerg. Even just  building block worth of creep more in the scenario can break the outcome because that one unit that move over that extra piece of creep moved a tiny bit faster. I noticed this in a game yesterday where I put my  queens on my ramp to block it but the left queen had  more piece of creep and already was way ahead and nearly broke the wallformationI dont know about the engine and technical aspects but taking the above if you were to play the same game in which you and your opponent made the exact same decisions each time there could still be discrepancies that build up over time. Are they gameending? Maybe maybe not. But that does mean there is some amount of luck involved not because the game is random but because the players are never perfect and  create their own void of chancerandomnessluck.Im just writing as I think at the moment am busy with my finals so really should be studying now p. Interesting discussion though and always fun to theorycraft on games especially deeply branched games like StarCraft .,starcraft,chlngp6,2,t5_2qpp6

Should implies some kind of universal godlike imperative.gt Also you wouldnt hinder them at expressing their opinion if you just ignore them ofc you can also debate with them thats all your choice I wont but theres no fun in that I enjoy debating an opposing viewpoint.gt but beeing happy someone dies just because you dislike themdissaggree with them is horribleThats your opinion.

In addition look at so many games that have really shit support  Total War series NBA K ON PC FIFA ON PC and the list could go on and on. I mean there are planty of games that were realeased and thats the end of it no continous support. Blizzard is not up to par with Valve or Riot but is definetly not the worst developer. Yeah the HUGE difference is basically only visible between LOL and DotA even Valve in CS community is regarded as shit. I see post on HLTV praising Blizzard last one was about sueing cheaters another one was about how amazing SC reflected SCBW compared to shit job in transfering cs . to CSGO and its not rare to see Valve do shit support on some of their games. Please also understand I do agree there is much to be done by Blizzard or perhaps they actually missed their chance already. But the offensive negative stance and attacking them on every possible forum is just unfair.

1174509,1,t1_ci1o4o0,Are you joking? The only issue with TvZ is that terran cant tech switch from MMM to a composition that can deal with ultrabanemuta without dieing. Other than that its pretty much fine. The issue with TvP is that the protoss has literally nothing to worry about early game because the MSC protects you at home and the threat of an oracle keeps the terran in their base. In WOL terran could put on all sorts of pressure ranging from  rax before WG to mid game stim timings but now theres basically nothing they can do. This would be fine if terran could enter the late game on equal footing by playing equally greedy but they cant. Add to this that terran needs to be the reactive race even tho terran production is the least adaptive of the three and its just plain difficult for t to do stay on equal. This isnt about  balance so much as it is making a good matchup for spectators and equal difficulty for both races.

Im still finding my journalism voice  that is making concise and clear points in text that express my meaning. I could have done a better job with the GD part  the gist wasnt so much that people say dumb things but that the environment that harbors open communication good or bad often leads to good dialogue outside. i.e. many began to discuss women in eSports after that incident which may not have occurred outside of HSC VIII. lt That was the thing I wanted to highlight but I believe I could have done it better.

1265867,1,t1_cic0fzs,They entered the SC scene with that stability behind them. A lot of their decisions with what to do with those resources were unquestionably retarded. The Arizona team house being one of the best examples. Absolutely nothing of worth ever came out of it they had guys like Strifecro Axslav and Machine squatting there for god knows how long the legitimately promising players who went there got no extra benefit out of it because they did nothing but play on NA ladder which they could have done anywhere. They threw an absurd amount of money at HuK to pull him away from Liquid only for his results to fall off right after that. They never showed any intelligence whatsoever when it came to building or developing a roster just picking up the flavor of the month and hoping they continued to be worth it. They invested a ton in venturing into Proleague only to call it quits after a single season. EGs entire strategy can be easily summed up as throwing money at shit and hoping it pays off.

1350363,0,t1_ciljg6z,gt Explain then how toss can defend terran agression with  gateway while teching to colossus on base?base robo fac into robo bay   robo fac has been Standard since WoL sorry. The Colossus Timings didnt get faster in HotS they got slower because the MSC means  gas more needs to be invested before the robo can start.gtGetting dropped in your main? Click  button and you defended successfully  you are delusionalgtThis happens pretty much every single game I play... Double medivac drop in the main while poking the front... overcharge in main means I have to get outor risk losing medivac and UnitsIf you actually watched any progames youd know that  marauders easily take out a nexus under photon overcharge.gtProves that you have very little experience lategame. Colossustemplartempest is stronger than Ghostviking until the terran can get ravens out and by that point warp ins zealotsdts are usually already crippling the terranAlmost all people at GM level and above agree that ghost viking is stronger than any protoss army without tempests. If you actually visited TL instead of reddit only you wouldnt be oblivious to this.gtThe difference being zerg has to make a ton of units to prepare for the push while toss needs a handful of units  overcharge to defend agression. yup  queens  lings and  spines are defenitely such a huge investment. Also argueing about investments on the zerg side just shows how little you really do know about this game since you are completely disregarding the larva factor.gtThis works for people who do gate blink all ins as well you force enough of a response out of the terran that you end up ahead because the terran has to invest so much in defense that they end up behind. So you can just go home and defend whatever counter push with overcharge and the gateway units you have. This again shows how little progames you have seen and how little you actively play unless of course you happen to be retardedly bad at TvP which is more likely. rax pressure builds werent broken in WoL either even though they always gave terran the lead every single game.,starcraft,cilk5ha,-1,t5_2qpp6

1351277,0,t1_cilmlzd,I stopped at Pocketing all the cash Just how much Cash Do you think k views is worth? lol. We have not yet made a dime off of this company and I have personally pocketed .And it truly does depend when it comes to how long it takes to reach k. Obviously if you are writing about LoL it will be the fastest route as we have had one blog alone bring in k  views. SC is a bit more difficult to give an estimate because we have yet to have a constant consistent flow of blogs. Very hit in miss as far as getting the news on the site.And as a writer for our site you have advantages over a lone blogger trying to make it on his own. . The website itself is in place looking good etc.. We have an audience already Obviously it needs build upon but it is there. We effectively market your work and use the team share method. As a company we try to get you to k views as quickly as possible.Why is that in place?. People have change of hearts often or realize it was more work than they thought and we cant afford being sued over a . Cent to  Check for the  blog someone puts up. Nor would we be able to send a mass amount of  checks.. It shows commitment and the ability to set goals and go after them.We do offer more than TShirts and the Bean Bags are Xorbee  Beanbags. Obviously we cannot get those for everyone. Only for those truly commited and reaching milestones and goals.We also do a writer of the month award and are establishing gift cards and etc for the winners.We do understand that your not making a stable check that you are able to survive on. But you need to understand we are not able to provide that until we grow. As far as views can be falsified that is totally correct. We do not try to falsify any views our writers have access to all view counts. We use the views method at the moment because it directly correlates with google adsense which is the only money rG has coming in at the moment and believe me No one could live off of that. The money we have made off of adsense has been put into tournaments that our staff has asked for.  free to enter LoL Tournament coming up Augthth. We recently did a COD Charity tournament for MDA we did and Injustice free to enter tournament. etc. I personally have made nothing as the VP of Operations and Tournaments The owner of rG has made nothing. We are totally for paying our writers and they will be the st to be paid.Thats about all of the back and forth i can handle for the day. There is absolutely no way that i can convince you we are for the writers.  ,starcraft,cilo9wp,1,t5_2qpp6

1429092,0,t1_ciuqkp5,Protoss is really strong in HotS because of the Mothership Core. It allows the Protoss to easily defend lots of aggression that they used to struggle against. Protoss always naturally had the strongest late game compositions. Now with the MSC and increasingly easy to take rds. Protoss is just really strong because they consistently hit that deathball. Add onto this that Protoss has the largest variety of builds and all ins by many times over compared to other races. This makes scouting very hard for the other player as well. Since the response you need can vary so drastically. Also the MSC allows Protoss to pressure without fear of over extending because of the recall ability.Edit Yes recall existed in Brood War.

1436130,0,t1_ciwa87s,Okay let me guess youre a protoss player complaining about their precious race. Your argument lost all credibility when you mentioned that I dont have any knowledge about something Ive been playing for  years.Let me begin.st Yes marines thors and missile turrests are all able to fight mutalisks. So are hydralisks vikings void rays sentries ravens queens etc. I dont see the point in listing units that fight mutalisks.nd Phoenix has no use in late game. Almost every single unit can be used to your advantage into and throughout the late game. The phoenix is no different. Harassment picking up highdamage units such as marauders immortals and hydralisks during fights to name a few.rd Yes you do have to build phoenix before a muta switch. That is why you scout it for example you erased their army you see a spire researching an upgrade and they have excess gas income and then either take their base out completely tech switch yourself or build static defense.th Please point out my sympathetic pleas. Im not asking for symapthy from such a person as yourself Im pointing out a possible buff to help terran lategame. If you want to add anything feel free to do so but dont act like such a child when doing so.th Of course how could I forget adding splash damage to turrets something that is in thors would totally remove mutalisks in an entire matchup. If the zerg player has any experience at all they will know not to clump up their mutalisks when engaging missile towers thus increasing the skill cap for all races and making it harder for races to just a move into mineral lines as they attack from the front.Next time you say dont talk about things you dont have any knowledge about be sure not to follow it up with such stupidity  it makes you look like a clown.,starcraft,ciwanao,5,t5_2qpp6

1491597,0,t3_2b7siw,Ladder map pool used to be a lot less tournament friendly. That was the reason for a separate tournament map pool. Sometimes a ladder map was used but it was modified a bit forced cross spawns xelnaga towers removed rocks removed gold removed etc..This year Blizzard is adding and removing maps from the ladder pool so quickly  that even if we are using the ladder pool in almost every tournament we still get to see more maps played within a year in premier events than back in the days of Antiga Shipyard.It is true however that Blizzards standards for ladder maps restrict the freedom of map makers. But from a competitive stand point tournament maps shouldnt be too unique because it too often just causes imbalance which leads to vetoing the map out. I guess the flip side of having ladder maps being tournament maps is that it removes ladder as a sand box to test creative maps which could find their way to the tournament pools eventually.,starcraft,cj38vpu,1,t5_2qpp6

It can be fun to watch but at the same time watching a match and a potential detonation that is just a complete dud losing the game for a terran is just shitty. Same goes for the other way around when a lucky mine hit ends it. The only way I see this being fixed the way people would like is to fix the tank. The problem with that is that would no doubt mean some very serious muta nerfs bc as it stands mutas are too fast to even consider tank pushes. Which actually reminds me and changes my position a bit. I think we have to recall how buffed up mutas are now. Theyre are insanely fast and have ridiculous health recharge. So in a way I feel like mutas own strengths necessitates the mine buff revert. But thats not to say that mutas dying to a handful of random detonations is cool. If it were up to me Id redesign the Thor. Maybe make the AA gun fire faster with less splash? or make Thor cost slightly less? Idk. The matchup is super finicky. ,starcraft,cj5ndxl,2,t5_2qpp6

Which other Koreans other than MCs AMA have taken the time to write a post on reddit?Unlike foreigners Koreans just want to play the game. They really dont want to involve themselves in promoting themselves their sponsors or having to do anything but practice because thats the purpose of the team. During breaks of practice Koreans just want to talk to their fans friends family or whoever else is available to socialize with in the immediate vicinity. In foreignerland players dont trust their teams so they are building their own brands because foreigner teams either dont offer enough to begin with or are so immature in all facets of operation i.e. management finances long term planning incentive goals exit strategies fallbacks expansions and networking instead of practicing and actually getting good at the game. I speak to more A and B tier Koreans than I do with all foreigner players because Koreans are so welcoming and friendly towards anybody that takes an interest to them. I dont intend that statement to be bragging but Koreans have expressed to me that its important for them to talk to fans during practice to stay motivated and to constantly reinvigorate the drive to improve during their practice.,starcraft,cjbvqze,-4,t5_2qpp6

1596230,0,t1_cjgd731,The Halo effect is but a simple symptom of a far larger problem. It doesnt just pertain to people it pertains to everything. People have such a severe problem recognizing that positive and negative qualities can coexist in a single entity. If they first saw something positive they are inclined to believe everything after that is positive same for negative. This isnt just people this is cars computers political schools of thought video games chairs.Which is why I think this stupid false dilemma of classing things in either positive and negative needs to go. People should really stop asking themselves Is this positive or is this negative and just descriptively focus on what it is. Hell the English language often has two words for the very same concept which describes whether or not the speaker finds it positive or negative. Take the age old example terrorist or asymmetric freedom fighter both mean the same thing and describe the same tactics. The choice of words only communicates if they are your ideological allies or not. But heres the problem there is no neutral word if they are neither. There is no word simply to describe this set of tactics without communicating that you are either on their side or against them. Its virtually impossible to in the English language write some text about this concept and many others without communicating whether or not you think its positive or negative and when you think its neither theres just virtually no way of saying that except putting Note that I neither approve of nor deplore these tactics and even if you add that disclaimer people will still get either impression. Because everything has to be positive or negative theres just virtually no way any more to give an objective descriptive analysis of the situation without coming with a valuejudgement of some sort.See this coincidentally another symptom of the same problem and the same applies to easy to play race people find Zoo frustrating to play against thats negative therefore everything about it must be negative it must be easy to play take no skill and the people who play it are probably nasty people too. People constantly live into this simplistic delusion where they think that say maphackers must be evil people who constantly have a sinister smile are violent abrasive and whatnot but if you actually meet one of them its a normal person like everyone else is. Hell if you meet a serial killer its probably going to be a normal person too. Reality isnt like some piece of fiction where every serial killer ever speaks with a sinister voice and if hes good at his stuff probably with a British accent to top it off. This isnt Star Trek Into Darkness where you can see that Khan and Marcus are evil by their voice and speech patterns alone. Or some Disney film where everyone whos a bad guy is also ugly probably has warts and whatnot reality does not work like that. Serial killers rapists murderers you cant recognize them they arent ugly and they dont talk with a super sinister voice as well.,starcraft,cjgdhhc,8,t5_2qpp6

It does damage but so will you when its your turn.Edit  Ive faced this more in Diamond and understand your fear. To counter at  simply make slings until you secure map control. This might be like  but the Hellion gt Hellbat death push requires walking marines  marauders across the map and hellions transforming right outside expo. Sending out slings forces hellion micro and in either case the marines and marauders die. Without their support the push is worthless. And with slings chasing hellions round they have no time to convert and will retreat to home. After hellions retreat return to making drones.

In the recent past Ive seen him throw a lot of PvZs due to being TOO aggressive with his army and stepping out when he really shouldnt be so this series to me looked like a more defensivepassive HerO that really wanted to solidify his win  instead of jumping the gun and overstepping when he thought he had a lead.,starcraft,cjou8jq,1,t5_2qpp6

1700677,0,t3_2dvqyl,GSL is the korean equivalent of WCS in the NAEU the prize money for st place is bigger than the other  but the rest is the same  GSL is also the hardest of them . ProLeague is a team league where teams face all the other teams once per round where they pick players prior to the matches playing Bo and chosing ace players if it comes to that can pick a player who has already played in the same match. KeSPA stands for Korean eSports Association   can google for more. Also you may have heard of the KeSPA cup where they take the top  players of every region and from ProLeague   players that joined them through the qualifiers earlier today.EDIT Now players qualify for Code S through Code A which is again group stage where  players advance from each group while challenger leagues are Bo vs a single player do advance to premier. Some time ago Code A and Code S were a different thing meaning you could win Code A. Also there were up and down matches check liquipedia about these things.,starcraft,cjtj70c,4,t5_2qpp6

1708485,0,t1_cjuf0u4,Thanks for the screenshot... It allowed me to get to the bottom of this quickly and I can see where the misconception has come from.All Ireland Startcraft and QCon are independent organisations but AIS run StarCraft  as part of QCons eSports track. Weve many relationships of this kind with different groups. AISs policy on nb is their decision to make but we werent aware of it and dont share it.QCon have a number of official sponsors E.g. BT Microsoft GameStop Steve Jackson Games all negotiated and agreed directly with QCon. From these sponsors QCon provides prizes for all official tournaments. In addition our TOs are free and encouraged to solicit prize support from anywhere they can E.g. Books Toys vouchers. QCon doesnt really keep track of prize support garnered by TOs. Via AIS nb Gaming donated prize support for the Starcraft  tournament at QCon and Id like to thank them for this  but this could not in any way be considered as helped out quite a bit with regards to QCon.The only official contact QCon has had with nb Gaming was whenever their event in Cork was cancelled. We didnt know the reasons at the time but have seen similar events fall down on things like volunteers network power safety etc. We frequently support other groups and events on these kinds of issues and so offered to deploy staff logistical and technical support to whatever level they needed to bolster them through the event. Unfortunately the reasons for cancellations were not down to deficiencies in these areas.TLDR  AIS and QCon are independent organisations. They have a policy about nb posts QCon doesnt. Nb Gaming donated a prize via an affiliate but had nothing to do with organising or running QCon XXI .,starcraft,cjuilhz,2,t5_2qpp6

Anything I remotely disagreed with I was absolutely crazy willing to fight arguments just to claim a victory over someone on the internet.Now I only pick the battles that I feel will either benefit me or the person Im arguing with this case I feel I have no benefit and you do not want to see any.gt what have I been wrong about game wise during any of the shows? I have never mentioned in my original statement about you being completely wrong. I was trying to offer advice.I said you was negative and angsty.,starcraft,ck29hfy,1,t5_2qpp6

He had the better unit composition he defended drops betteryeah Flash killed a nexus but MC killed way more worker with his runby  drop and he denied the third of Flash for so long. Flash took better engagements and hit some sick emps but other than that MC wasnt worse. And in game  Flash pretty much allined MC with MC waiting too long to tech for aoe.

1875782,0,t1_ckexqk8,gt You realize that the lock will make people train harder right?Conjecture and pretty unlikely in my opinion.gt The problem with NA is there is a stigma about it that it sucks.A stigma that is true.gt Well it only sucks because all the top pros abandoned it. yet when you have TBs tournament where ladder matters suddenly the quality becomes great because people are playing on it and trying.great is a relative term.Besides its not an issue that it sucks because people who live in NA have acceptable latency with KR and can just train there. And any NA pro who takes it seriously would do that the problem is they dont take it seriously.Also a thing Koreans who practice directedly understand but what many NA pros dont seem to get is that playing to win and playing to improve are two entirely different things. NA pros ladder trying to win every single game and place high on the ladder rather than using the ladder to get a quick game trying to eliminate the flaws in your gameplay.Training means purposefully doing a strat you are bad at to improve weaknesses in your play quite often this of course lads to a lower winrate.I also cant take people like Catz seriously who say the ladder should be real and non Barcode that just shows you arent in it to actually improve. Anyone whos serious about using the ladder to improve and eventually winning tournaments will use a barcode and will make it has hard as possible to be recognized on the ladder.

It cant possibly be easy dealing with the constant everything surrounding him or used to be at least.But I simply cant find the space in my heart to pour over someone unwilling to reflect upon themselves and make an effort at understanding better the effects of their behaviour. If he was anyone close to me personally it would be a completely different story. I may have the opportunity to possibly say some stuff and have it heard. And more importantly offer an ear to listen to the troubles. Maybe I could help him with the opportunity to learn more about himself through introspection alongside someone he can feel comfortable and trustworthy with.But he isnt anyone to me and Im not anyone to him. I dont have the emotion to spare for someone who isnt anything to me and vice versa. However just sometimes I cant let the opportunity pass to point out what there is to be critical of.Again I sincerely do hope for better things in his future.

Mainly Hearthstone and Heroes of the Storm. So when those games have more following WCS will be somewhat of a long last brand to further give them the necessary boost.

1967704,0,t1_ckqauqk,Banelings and storm actually require offensive micro not just defensive micro. In other words the Banelings have to be moved split and detonate only if needed while storm requires the positioning of slow ass high templar and storm aimpredict. Mines you just burrow and hope they hit something good. You can target fire mines but lets be real here if you have mines are you going to target fire every one of them and hope their target doesnt run out of range while you have chargelotsBanelings rolling up on your army? Probably not unless youre someone like teaja. Even then you still have to hope it hits its target before the target leaves the range. Furthermore defensive micro isnt that well highlighted. Sure you can split but you are unable to determine where the single strong blast of damage will hit as the defender. Sometimes it will go to that single sacrificial probe othertimes to the  others you pulled back.  It is for this reason  that I would be in favor of making the widow minds target turn red like seeker missile. However that would probably make the unit terrible which goes to show just how much the unit relies on hope from both sides.

1971571,0,t1_ckqrn89,gt They start by saying that I dont know about their field Theyd be right to do so considering you use the most flagrant example of bad science and then imply that every contemporary psychology scholar is painfully ignorant of how to science. gt I dont they quite understand that when I say rigour I mean rigour. Not human inductive reasoning but rigorous deduction. Scholars in psyc rip on each others designs all the time just as scholars in other discplines do to each other. We have rigour to the extent that theories are constantly put to the test and only those that survive the gauntlet of theoretical and methodological criticism can be taken seriously. gt You cannot deny the simple difference that never has a mathematical result after proven been disproven  My respect for math as a discpline does not need lead me to the conclusion that psychology as a discpline is devoid of merit and that the scholars of psychology are fucking retarded as you implied in your original post. Furthermore your premise that harder discplines like mathematics never undergo revision is silly as well. For example takes Johannes Kepler and his ideas regarding celestial astronomy. The man was brilliant but the data he was provided was flawed and in turn his theory and postulations were in turn flawed. As measurement was improved and refined so too were advances in the accuracy and precision of astronomy etc. The same parallels can be drawn to any given field  as collection of higher quality data becomes more feasible it can only be expected that a fields consensus will change in the direction of higher accuracy. gt while mainstream consensus in psychology flips  degrees  What are the best examples of this  degree flipping? If youre going to cite psychoanalysis and freud and all that bullshit bear in mind that that shit predates the actual scholarly pursuit that is psychology. I repeat psychoanalysis and psychodynamic theory bullshit predates psychology as a scientific endeavour. Theories are often refined yes but that is the whole point of a science. Nothing is taken as dogma or unchanging fact. If we examine astronomy many ideas about the cosmos have been subjected to change e.g. revolution of sun around the planets to revolution of planets around the sun whether or not pluto ought to be considered a planet. The relative importance of proteins vs. nucleic acids is another example in biology although one I dont remember very well. Or how about in Chemistry when it was originally proposed that acids were best defined as proton donors? Then when certain exceptions to this rule appeared the theory was refined such that acids would be best defined as electron acceptors instead. gt  if you demonstrate something rigorously theres no way to later go back on it.If our field was defined by being unable to go back despite being faced with waves of new evidence itd be quite the pseudoscience. gt thats what being rigorous means For us being rigorous means following the scientific method Formulate a theory extrapolate from that theory a series of TESTABLE predictions propose a test of your predictions carry it out collect the data and make it public as you interpret it. Someone else may disagree with your jump from theory to predictions or perhaps they will disgaree with how you carried out the test maybe they will disagree with how you analyzed the data or how you interpreted the results. The beauty is through disagreement and bloody criticism we emerge a little wiser with insights that have practical applications.This is a far cry from devoid of merits.There are problems with psychology as a discipline but you are grossly mistaken if you think you have correctly identified what they are. The recent social psyc scandal re falsification of data is the greatest indictment of our field in recent times. Of course this is a problem regarding academic dishonesty moreso than research ineptitude as you had suggested. ,starcraft,ckqrwjk,9,t5_2qpp6

1977816,0,t1_ckriphl,Thanks for the response.  Didnt want to make it too obvious what I was prodding for in the text submission above  but the idea is that its already proven that high spikes in tournament viewership leads to increased playsinterest in a game as shown here by valve and CSGO  You can definitely attribute a lot of this to being able to view the tournament inclient but its still worth talking about.  I was trying to get a feel for how the inverse goes  does signs that a community is stagnating actually discourage from watching subsequent tournaments or playing more of the game take place?  And if not  what is most important in keeping interest?  The gameplay itself or the tournaments watched?  Theres the big obvious concern that Im fielding this to rstarcraft users who have clearly stuck with the game and community through some of the ups and downs but nobody else would have taken the survey to begin with so I thought Id see what the results were.

Its a problem in every competitive game that allows the player to turn a small early advantage into a large later advantage. Some games try to introduce catchup features  in the case of both Dota and Lol the losing team gets more money for player kills  but really its either massive catchup features or limited player influence over macro.And Im not sure how youd implement catchup in an RTS.,starcraft,ckwiudm,1,t5_2qpp6

All the siege units in SC have at least  which is probably due to how finicky  range siege units were in brood war if their pathing pushed them slightly apart theyd take cannon damage.  So...at least .I dont know that they necessarily need to be like  so that they counter siege tanks vipers and brood lords exist for screwing over tanks.  In brood war siege tank vs lurker micro was pretty interesting where tanks would move forward siege and lurkers would respond by retreating just out of range burrow.  Note also that due to being a singletarget nonsplash unit their DPS and HP are higher so there would also be YOLO moves where you run your impalers forward into a tank line and burrow them all relying on their higher stats to bust the tanks which wont be dodging the shots if theyre sieged.

2075646,0,t1_cl3n83j,I think thats something that I liked that youve cleared up.Not wanting to feel like you arent good enough but when Unfiltered wrapped up I think A lot of people were looking for where they would get similar sort of content and you happened to be bringing a show that had Destiny so I had this expectation that this is the Unfiltered replacement which it just simple isnt. And people going in expecting that its probably disappointing.In some respects of the show when you talk about Balance or WCS or whatever upcoming event it says to me well clearly this is a show about SC. But then you bring guest on like Redeye Richard and col.Beef and then that says clearly you want to diversify to all of esports which is more of what Unfiltered was.I guess what Im saying is that If you are an Esports show and ARE trying to be the Unfiltered replacement then to me it needs to be rebranded as such and the topics need to be focused around current events and not meta things unless its huge like Dotas last patch. If you are instead an SC show You need SC guest you cant just bring in the same people Chanman had because though we love them lt Richard they arent meant for your show. At the moment It feels like your floating somewhere in between touching topics that relate to all of esports Like last weeks talk on Unions in esports but still trying to shift it onto SC and it feels forced like Hey look we are an sc show.What you choose is up to you and dont think that this is an opinion that you have something to live up to you absolutely dont but I think you need time to Make sure you know what kind of show you want to be and then all decisions should focus on that.,starcraft,cl3nri4,5,t5_2qpp6

2078631,0,t3_2iomu8,holyshit this guy has his head up his ass.gt Secondly if we want to address the statement literally I would say that everyone in the world has an existential hole in their life. Except you singled them out and you said the reason they have that existential hole is BECAUSE THEY ARE POLISH.  If he had said these polish people have an existential hole to fill in their life or even people have a hole to fill then MAYBE Id buy his bullshit.gt...problem of being a human being alive in the st century and outside of the natural environment human beings apparently originated from.Ah yes if its natural it must be better.  For someone who opened his letter by explaining that hating on him is a logical fallacy poisoning the well this dude sure does love the appeal to nature fallacy!  Hell it sounds like hes basing his whole fucking life around it.  His existential hole exists because nature is better than society.  YUP.Oh and when he starts talking about Africa I hope this dumbass realizes that Africa is not a third world country like he believes it to be.  ITS NOT EVEN A COUNTRY.  But he makes a comparison between poland and what he believes to be a third world country.  Funny how he later gets mad at steven for comparing it to other countries despite steven saying compared to france it looks like a shithole and then takes steven compared the two to mean steven said the two are exactly the same.  So using Thorin being mad at steven logic he is saying poland is a third world country not some bullshit commentary on how big events are used to mask the problems of a country.  Dont be fooled.A bit off topic because well the first hour of read of his  page book here was pretty off topic these countries are taking funds that could have been used to make things better! and instead using them to attract forefingers to stimulate their economy and bring more revenue in hoping that they make their investment back  and then some.  This way instead of just throwing money into a hole and hoping that the hole closes up they can get other people to throw money at their problems too and this way the amount of money they throw is more than the initial amount they had.  Its like....imagine you arent mining any mineralsgas so you build a fucking command center and someone goes but youre supply blocked you should fix that first! well I only have  minerals if I build this command center I can build supply depots after that and this money can make me more money.  Sure something might come over and fuck up your plan but its not like theyre trying to trick the rest of the world into thinking everything is good so they can win some popularity contest.gtI am Thorin and I have quite a blunt way of speakingYes and that gets you fired.  It doesnt excuse you from shit.  If someone doesnt want to give you money because youre an asshole then you need to ask do I want to be an asshole? or do I want money?.  I could only imagine this dude as a teenager at his first job as a cashier cursing out people  getting fired  and telling his boss well thats just the way I am mI cant read any more of this bullshit.,starcraft,cl41ffi,153,t5_2qpp6

2080500,0,t1_cl40802,TLDRAfter his comments were spread Thorin was told to not publicly say anything about the matter and to let it die down naturally. He wasnt allowed to address this topic which led to people taking his opinions out of context.Any apology he does make is going to seem like a fake apology. He doesnt care about them and is only speaking now so that some people who want to listen would have context about the issues.Thorin doesnt like eSports events or travelling. He only went to meet people and produce content.He calls his trips to Germany the worst weeks of his life. He doesnt enjoy French food or culture. And doesnt particularly like the US either.When he was asked to appear on Unfiltered he had a heavy workload and only did it to help out someone else in the eSports scene.He spent around  hours researching teams and watching VODS of CSGO. He had to combine this with his own show and analyzing stuff for ROCCAT.Drinks energy drinks before talk shows and energy drinks make him irritable.Holy shit this is a lot longer than I realized...TLDR of TLDR Part  Doesnt enjoy travelling comments taken out of context extremely busy workload prior to the talkshow.Part Received the wrong time of when talkshow starts so he didnt get pretalk time with the other hosts.Prior experience with Poland is that its a formerly rundown country trying to become developed again. His idea of Poland also influenced by his Polish friends.His comments towards the Polish having nothing in their country was a joke because he believes everyones perception is still in s communist Poland.Also said his comments because he didnt want to get peoples hopes up.His comments about it being cheap are because Poland rarely holds international events and its economical situation means that its going to be free or cheap.Existential hole statement is a joke and is serious ?. Starts trying to sound philosophical or something... I think he says until Poland accepts that theyre not that hyped theyre going to be consistently disappointed.Olympics in Africa was a metaphor and he has no knowledge of any Olympics even being in Africa. He said this because governments waste a shit ton of money trying to make their country seem better than it really is.Worst country in Europe. He exaggerated this and based his entire comment off of what he heard from others.Ukraine is worse. Terrible experiences there when he visited. Player abuse by police.Polish are racist. Once again this generalization is from people he knows or from what they say.Destinys style of argument helped contribute to the reason why he made such exaggerated and hyperbolic points.Even if you scape goat him for these comments many Polish people acknowledge these problems in their country. Him being blamed wont solve them.Hes said things like this before about other countries and no one said anything.Polish people he knows dont seem affected by it and this situation doesnt change his opinion about Poland.Hell probably never go to Poland again.Discuss Regi and his relationship later.Oh lordy.TLDR of TLDR Part  Wont change his opinions. Knowledge of Poland comes from Polish friends and the worlds perception of Poland. He was joking and slightly serious though most of his statements are exaggerations.

2115996,0,t3_2j52ls,Im super happy to see more community figures come out in support of microtransactions. Trying to explain why microtransactions are ultimately beneficial to everyone as well as to all the arbitrary features everyone wants implemented is sometimes like talking to a brick wall. Everyone wants the instant gratification of this or that easy implementation or improvement often not realizing theyre essentially asking Blizzard to develop at a loss. If you look at most of the other wishlist items theres nothing we could realistically expect to expand the current playerbase except FP but thats contingent upon microtransactions anyway yet we ask Blizzard to change their approach? Why should they? Their success is in no way threatened by middling sales of Legacy of the Void. And if were being honest with ourselves sales of Legacy of the Void are going to be pretty damn good no matter what you or I think were owed as patrons of StarCraft. I really hope Blizzard opts to take a chance on the community and allow us to build ongoing revenue for them. To be clear theres nothing easy about implementing microtransactionsits a tremendous development effort in and of itself. But I suspect it would eventually turn a healthy profit and inherently grow the playerbase more rapidly than weve ever seen in the history of StarCraft .

Some very hot and skilled blood is moving in to regions where only a few people can compete. However when the bar is set so high team practice vamps up with these players and money starts flowing heavier it will merely make up an coming foreigners that much more driven and that much better. ,starcraft,cliks4x,1,t5_2qpp6

This is what guys do and youre entering into a male dominated area and trying to shit everything up.I wouldnt go to a yoga class and demand they start playing death metal and using more foul language to make me more comfortable.

Pull your fucking heads out of your cunts and find a sense of humor. Or dont find a sense of humor but dont go hysterical like a little child when someone shit talks you in game.Its funny the more the SJWs fight for their rights in gaming the more people despise them. If they werent so fucking annoying needy and sensitive nobody would give a fuck what gender they are. The only reason female gamers are a thing is because theyre fucking annoying and nobody wants to listen to their bullshit.

2410922,0,t1_cm9gz31,In this context rape means killing an opponent without him having power to fight back or somethign similar so I dont really see the point.Also there is a lot more aggrevated assault than there is rape. I dont think that the current hysteria about the subject is based in reality especially considering that rape rates as well as other forms of violent crime have been decreasing since  years. The statistical approach is flawed anyways though. The rape of  man is just as bad as the rape of  woman no matter how often it happens to one gender or the other.Saying that one thing is ok and the other is not is basically the same as saying that one is worse than the other and that the sensibilities of only one of the groups matter.Besides you can just choose to not follow someone on twitter. Is it really that hard? Does every twitter account and every twitch stream need to cater to your personal sensibilities? Because most already do just by themselves. Why does it need to be EVERY SINGLE ONE of them? Thats why your analogy in your previous post is flawed. Most people will cater to peoples sensibilities anyways just not ALWAYS in EVERY situationgroupetc.gtAnd its so silly because the same people would probably be a lot more respectful and understanding in real life but dont wish to show the same courtesy in the gaming culture. There is a big difference between someone asking someone else to behave a certain way and demanding it with possible repercussions if they dont change their behavior.

Sonic uses a resolution hack which increases the resolution meaing more viewing space! but at the fixed aspect ratio  then afreeca stretches it. thats why in the two pictures I posted at the bottom the  looks much closer to the original proportions in game compared to the . This all goes back to what Ive been saying from the beginning to someone who doesnt play the game regularly Im not saying that you have never played! just saying your eyes are not already used to one thing!  looks fine! As a matter of fact I showed my brother a sonic stream before and he hasnt touched BW in..  years and he thought the  looked great. Its just for regular players who dislike the widescreen because it is different from what they are used to seeing. But this true  you were talking about is something a majority of the people would back for a spectator mode as in actually adding more pixels in to the sides to fill up a  aspect ratio instead of merely stretching it. If it looked like this I think it would be freakin BEAUTIFUL for a viewing experience. But the current SSL stream in  looks very stretched for me so I watch it in  because afreeca has that option to change aspect ratios.,starcraft,cmgsrhy,1,t5_2qpp6

The last game was tense and score went to  excluding this the series wasnt even good.Also your kind of people that argue while you werent even following the scene at the time is pretty annoying.

Unless mines hit the field because mines just slaughter that composition so hard its not even funny.But lets be real its  in the game did the Protoss start his proxy at min? Also his macro he has  bank so he cant get a good amount of DT or archons here which might also have to do with the lack of rd or th gas but if he went for blink he would not have a critical mass of stalkers because by the looks of it its  gates right now.

And later when you have a grasp on the flow of the game you will notice that optimization is a great way to get a lead. I wouldnt bother with builds before plat. Edit of course knowing what to make against certain races is a good thing. And looking up some key scoutingproduction information is a great way to help your play.

2512621,0,t1_cmlxvj5,gt i think SC and more widely RTS games are never going to be leading esports games.I really cant disagree more. I watched Brood War VODs religiously in a language I cant even understand because the games were interesting and almost every day youd see something unique or innovative that you could directly apply to your own play. Oh yeah I used to also play StarCraft. Nowadays Ill watch CSGO Dota and even Street Fighter before Ill throw on an SC match and Im fucking terrible at Street Fighter.SC isnt very popular because for the most part the games have become boring to watch. The map differences are completely negligible compared to what they were like in BW and then you throw in the insane predictability of builds... what percentage of games go to base vs. base and then someone wins or loses as they expand...   ? Thats with players almost unilaterally having maxed out armies of one of maybe two or three different compositions tops depending on what the flavor of the month is or what units Blizzard hasnt neutered recently.I actually thought the Dreamhack Finals were one of the best series Ive seen in years but I still have very little interest in following the games until LotV comes out because it was the exception not the rule.,starcraft,cmmjdqg,1,t5_2qpp6

An increased emphasis on team play in order to get more people playing. Many in this subreddit have mentioned this would be essential for a larger player base. Even a simple UI change could do so even though the arcade isnt huge the new UI really did increase the number of open games and players playing.A LANmode to appease the LAN crowd and to making running tournaments more smooth. A constant issue from WCS to Dreamhack are obnoxious and unnecessary downtimes.More interaction with the community on the ground level. As an SC player I feel like Blizzard is this invisible entity that runs WCS and releases patches. For Riot LoL or Valve DOTA  I feel I can post on forums on reddit etc. and someone from the company will give me a personal response regarding my issue in a reasonable amount of time.I understand they cant and should not respond to every balance complaint but it seems ridiculous it took a massive rstarcraft postcommunity whining to get a hacking clan off the ladder.,starcraft,cmni16c,0,t5_2qpp6

2521131,0,t3_2oj8y0,Agreed. LotV is the right time to consider this.While this will make blings weaker better prespread for marines it will also make lings stronger better melee concaves and better prepositioning against AoE  think against widow mines tanks and colossi for instance to preposition  different lings to take the initial shots or to preconcave lings against bunkers. It will shift a lot of things especially AoE power. Which is cool with me  imo AoE is a little too good and melee units are a little too weak.If you think it will screw up Protoss you are wrong. You can place for instance colossi in the back zealots in the front Amove and expect the army to keep that order which it wont now. You can make a much more efficient clump put a lot more intelligence into your army and expect that intelligence to stay intact.The main point of this is that it preserves intelligence in positioning which SC does not do now.I like the clumping tendency in SC from a certain point of view I like that Starcraft has swarms but you could make it optional for instance making amove conserve position and normal move causing a clump or add a third movement mode.,starcraft,cmnnefu,29,t5_2qpp6

Casters want to make their show as accessible as possible and pumping up the crowd when a player is fucking up the other one teaches viewers that this is when to be excited someone is playing well here etc. etc.Home story cup feels so wonderful because the players are talking to each other not as much the audience and dont feel any pressure to make a super casualfriendly cast.

The reason they dont want to give out watchable streams for free is because too many people wont pay if they can get something good enough.

The locusts do a LOT of damage though when they reach a base.  can wipe out half of the base from my experience if they get close enoughA lot of overreaction are peiple mistakingly assuming th current SH role just slotting neatly into updated SH.

To tell you the truth Ive found that SC just isnt the game for me and Ive moved on to Dota .Im sure youve played a game or two of Dota in WC which is how I got into the game in the first place. I admit I played more footmen frenzy and murder at panda mansion than Dota but I still played a fair bit.Ive always felt like Dota  was the spiritual successor to WC though I have never played World of Warcraft.

2896001,0,t3_2t9p61,IMO perfect way to fix this issue. You still play  placements at the start. For your first game and all others as well you can choose what skill lvl opponent you want bronze to gold. If you win a match against the highest league possible you could have chosen your cap increases one league. So chosing the highest one everytime and winning all would be play against gold plat diamond master gm. This wouldnt be a problem for new players either since they wouldnt win against gold players so they would never get the chance to choose any opponent higher than gold league. This is ofcourse never gonna happen cause it wouldnt just be able to be done by a hotfix and theirby blizzard wouldnt invest into this.,starcraft,cnxa2mz,0,t5_2qpp6

2989281,0,t1_co7rt3r,Im not ignoring anything. The fact is he was down like  supply and had a huge bank. If the terran is semi concomitant then that will be a loss  of the time. At High diamond  you can turn it around with good banelign micro but the way he engage showed he wasnt high diamond plus so it wasnt really the widow mines that killed him in the end. They helped but the fact he didnt have units is what killed him. He wasnt supply blocked in the little clip and he still had a huge bank. That means he either wasnt injecting so that means bad macro. Also it was bad micro because his engagement was terrible and the mines got a shot off. When the mistake is you are not spending your money not injecting especially against terran I can look at that one mistake and say he lost because of that because the truth is he did. Had he spent that bank he would have crushed that army. I didnt see the game so I have no idea what the terran. As a zerg player I can look at zerg and say X because Ive been there where I am down  supply and I know that I cant really comeback the widow mine was just the straw that broke the camels back and ended it. I can write zerg off because he didnt even try and split vs all the mines and that is never going to end well for zerg. ,starcraft,co7u47k,1,t5_2qpp6

Obviously it wouldnt be useful past that once the opponent knows of itNowhere in my post did I even say the upgrade should be removed. Once the upgrade is done gateways serve little purpose outside of making them into warpgates which might as well be made into a separate building entirely once the upgrade is researched. Obviously you shouldnt be able to warp in warpgates without having the upgrade.Just because its hard to do doesnt mean it shouldnt be done. Of course I dont expect it to be easy but if it makes for a better game then I dont see the problem in trying it. Just give each a different role and there wont be much to consider when deciding what to use. More defensive play? Should stick with gateways. More offensive? Warpgates. Of course its true that warpgates are superior in both areas right now but Id still rather have it so while it may be objectively better the choice of which to use it up to a players playstyle or the situation in the game.I would say the same thing for the archon thing. Going zealot heavy? Use HTs to save minerals. Going more gas heavy? Go with DTs.

3102988,0,t1_cojm5se,Blind naturals can still be punished. Having  bases for either side provides more options for aggression. The problem with aggression in sc is not at  or  bases. Its everything after that. Daedelus is the perfect example for some sort of wallable natural. That map was brutal. It was a mistake. Making a third harder to take makes any expansion based aggression very anti zerg. It requires rocks to block expos and long distances to deny fast creep spread. This necessarily puts Z on a clock effectively and puts pressure on them to be extremely aggressive vs P and T making the basically go all in. Dream pool was disliked by a lot of the pro scene as well.Look I get it you want aggressive maps. But aggressive isnt synonymous with making naturals very hard to take. Its just not the same thing. You can be aggressive off of  base and prevent thirds etc and this will be more pronounced in LotV where third bases will need to be take. More aggressively.You and I will just never agree though so sorry have a nice day.,starcraft,cojmggq,2,t5_2qpp6

3113105,0,t1_coklcfj,I think you misunderstand my position.  Looking realistic is more important than the mechanics being realistic.  For the medivac Id actually prefer it if the medivac had some smoke coming out of it because its a bit weird for a hp unit to appear identical to a full hp unit.  I understand though there are probably performancelaziness issues with doing that though.  I guess for the widow mine it would be fine if the missile could fissile out and fall on the ground after it loses the target.   Magically disappearing is the part that looks really sloppy and makes people think its a glitch.  Id say its sloppier than the hp medivac but then it doesnt appear as often.Also just because a topic is science fiction does not mean you abandon your intuition.  For example Ive never seen an alien spaceship but if an alien spaceship slams into an asteroid I expect it to break into smaller pieces rather than turn into a pink liquid. ,starcraft,coko7rd,1,t5_2qpp6

3158427,0,t1_copcy1u,gtYou do not need all races having the same strength perfect end game compositions. You just need similar strength compositions that can actually be reached in a real game. The entire crux of my argument is that without relying on freeunits BLs ITs Locusts and microstopping spells FG zerg does not have the similar strength you are talking about. I agree with you that if zerg late game armies were pound for pound as strong as terran and protoss it would not be balanced. Zerg economy and mechanics mean a completely even end game fight means zerg has a huge advantage due to tech switches and fastest remax. That is why I think needs an additional tier of unit. To give a zerg army that doesnt rely on free units and microstopping to ability to at least stand there long enough. As I said LoTV economy changes could render my opinion obsolete.

I understand the sentiment and the concept but without Blizzards approval and implementation this is getting into very murky waters.Neverminding the fact that most players are not capable enough to determine who is hacking and who either smurfing or just lucky. Besides outside of being labeled a hacker in this database what will it do? Findinglabeling a player a hacker will not change their status. In other games where the tribunal system exists it actually has an effect on the players standing. Such a system also offers an appeals system and is subject to final verification by the developers themselves. Therefore every ban is subject to at least some professionalexpert oversight. I know you are all frustrated by the lack of action on blizzards part but this is the reason why bans come in waves. Their system allows them to make informed decisions based on the actions of the players at an expert level so that bans remain consistent and based on reasonable evidence. Not witchhunting by amateur players. Depending on who youre banning and why this comes perilously close to legal line. I cant at all recommend that this is the way to do things.

Because you dont seem to understand what role different units play in a unit composition.gtPast that though everything you mentioned will be gone with the patch too. Good at zoning capital ships? Li mean sortof but significantly less so after the patch.Good.gt DPS vs massive? Well thats significantly less once they lose the bonus I would even say worse than a lot of units in the game once its gone Its approximately dps without the massive only slightly  less than a stimmed marine. Seems appropriate for a unit  with  range and hp   shields. x what a marine hasgt Good vs static defense? That strat is being ripped apart with the removal of turtle SH.If that strategy doesnt exist anymore then who cares if the tempest is weaker against it? What do you expect? That they were just going to nerf swarmhosts and leave everything else in the game alone and just let zerg auto lose to any toss that gets an air ball up and running?,starcraft,coy5yyh,1,t5_2qpp6

Making fun of someone like that just makes me feel like im back in middle school.To be fair Avilo can be entertaining to watch. You get to see mech vs Protoss and other things that get played out on a GM ladder that you dont normally get to see in tournaments because its not as viable. And he sticks to his Mech play style because its just the way he likes to play. The mech guides on his website are fun to read if you enjoy mech. Is Avilo capable of winning tournaments or being a top player? Not at all. I doubt he could ever take a game off Major. Avilo IS immature and has a bad mentality about balance but to be honest I do enjoy watching his stream just for the entertaining games and perspective on mech.,starcraft,coyqva9,8,t5_2qpp6

For those of you at work I have tried to extract the text of the blue post from the us.battle.net forumsgtgt Ladder League Distribution Update  March  gtgtPsione  Community ManagergtgtgtgtgtgtgtWell be applying some adjustments to the Heart of the Swarm ladder later today in all regions. We previously announced the changes that will be made during this maintenance earlier this week. Weve copied the relevant details for todays update below.gtgtgtgtAdjust league distributiongtgtAs mentioned weve identified that the current league distribution percentages arent in line with our target percentages. The upcoming distribution changes should allow many more players to be in the correct league and for each league to have the correct percentage of players based on the figures we announced for Heart of the Swarm. Once this adjustment is made some players will see a change in their current league placement.gtgtgtgtAdjust the starting point for new playersgtgtDue to the dynamic behavior of the StarCraft II ladder we also saw that the new player starting point had drifted over time. This resulted in new players facing higher skilled opponents than in previous seasons. Adjusting the starting point for new players should improve the new player experience as theyll be initially matched against lower league opponents once again.gtgtgtgtMaintenance to apply this update will begin around  p.m PST in the SEA region and be deployed at a staggered rate to all other regions throughout the day. During this update matchmaking functionality may become unavailable for a short period of time. We apologize for the inconvenience and will work to ensure this period of unavailability is as brief as possible. Players ingame during this time should be unaffected. gtgtgtgtWell look to provide further updates as maintenance is completed.gtgtgtgtRegion Status in expected deploy ordergtgtSEA PendinggtgtUS PendinggtgtKR PendinggtgtCN PendinggtgtEU Pendinggt,starcraft,cp5kj9f,4,t5_2qpp6

3339616,0,t3_2ydcrq,While that sounds great I would still rather have them remove divisions and put all the players in one ranking per league so you could be rank   etc..The reason is that right now rank only matters within your division. You cant compare your rank with your friends there actually is a Friends tab ingame where you have a custom leaderboard with your friends but its based on rank thus its useless. We can only use points. And that makes the rank useless. To know where we stand on a serverwide scale we have to resort to thrid party websites like nios.

3372190,0,t1_cpcmghj,I dont think its either. The problem stems from the decisions they made around interface when they created the game. They left in a bunch of tedious tasks and added some  larvae injecting mule dropping chrono boosting etc that are solved via better interface to increase skill cap making the game much less enjoyable to newer and casual players.  Everyone I talk to that no longer plays starcraft or never got interested is in pretty much the same camp. I honestly think the game would have been so much better if they automated a bunch of things right click on a unit to continue creating auto drop mule or chrono boost a building etc. There would be a lot less time required by players to devote to tasks that are literally just there to increase APM and more time to be creative with strategies or micro armies or anything else to further push the meta.   Ill end my rant now... I am not sure if the same sentiment is voiced here a lot or not but I just recently picked up SC again after switching to DotA and remembered why I didnt enjoy it. As a disclaimer I used to play a lot and climbed to Masters and then just burned out because the game didnt feel rewarding.,starcraft,cpcnkph,0,t5_2qpp6

3385928,0,t3_2yykae, Because he consistently smurfs in lower leagues and tries to justify this as educating his viewers. Obviously all his strategies are going to work in Silver or Gold league when you are a Master level player. Those people dont know how to deal with what you are doing and it makes everything youre doing look good. The bullshit he does wouldnt be nearly as successful if he played people of his own skill level. He denies that smurfing is a major issue while it is in fact ruining the game for casual players. Not everybody has hours on end to spend playing StarCraft II. Some people might just want to play a couple of games in the evening after getting home from work against opponents of similar skill. Running into somebody like Winter smurfing it up in Silver or Gold will result in these players just quit playing. He is view botting. If at this point you still believe his viewers are legit you might be mentally retarded. I think somewhere between like k and .k viewers are fake. I doubt he would get more than  viewers if he didnt view bot. Without the view bots he wouldnt be as high on Twitch in the streamer list and less people would tune into him. He was streaming today during IEM when Flash was playing Trap. He had . viewers and his chat was dead as fuck.

3399502,0,t1_cpfniw3,Oh no youre absolutely right I didnt understand it very well and what I did learn was from more casual players. At the time I couldnt really appreciate it whether it was actually great or not. Aside from being a game where you want to be shooting people in the face quickly and purchasing guns I couldnt really differentiate it from other realistic military shooters at the time. Perhaps those types of games werent overly prevalent at the time but I do recall having a lot of fun playing Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon the earlier iterations. It was probably due to being brought in by casual peers and also being drawn to other games.At first I really didnt like SCs multiplayer when compared to BW but the things I realized I didnt like about SC were the things that were put in place to separate the bad from the great the added macro mechanics basically. After getting into competitive SC these things quickly went from lame tackedon inconveniences to measuring sticks of skill and hard practice.

3403811,0,t1_cpg5cna,Man just read this post. Kinda depressing. You cant ever blame any failures or feelings of not getting what you deserve on other people. I highly doubt your a no life looser with no talets outside of the eworld. I bet you could make stuff happen for you in the real world if you really set your heart to it. Fact is that viewbots or not Winter gets viewers because he is a good streamer. Hes not incredible at the game but he is very good at constantly talking and attempting to entertain his audience. Looking at top twitch streamers you get by if your really fucking good at the game are already a name in the community or by gimmicks giveaways boobs being avilo etc etc.  I have no doubt winter would still be one of the top streamers if he had never had a viewbot. I have watched him smurf while drunk and been entertained. I saw him get GM and saw that the passion was definitely real. I tried streaming thinking it would be the easiest shit ever. Well fuck me the minute I was in game with a webcam on me I realised how hard it is to be entertaining and chatty with basically only yourself. Seems that right now you may not be an entertaining streamer just by the way you doubt yourself and put yourself down in your post. You can do anything you want if you set your mind to it just keep at it and keep in mind that being cool and successful in the eworld but being a nolife looser in real life is mutually exclusive. edit whats your twitch account?

Hell just have to see those tweets with daytv and naniwa wonder what are they about then click view conversation. It is Naniwa who had to go out of his way to check whether or not day has banned him by manually going to daytv. We dont know how many times he did it before day banned him.gtThe chances hell get so pissed off hell ban a pro player?What does being a pro player have to do with it? He never even followed him.

Mining has been completely automated. Adding the gas button feature will allow the user to control how many workers are selected at a time which still requires clicking and thought. If anything you can still do shift clicking the gas button just streamlines the process.gt The backlash youre getting in the thread is because your suggestion goes against what all SC players feel on a fundamental level...I appreciate the criticism but I dont appreciate my idea being called stupid by other posters.

3465639,0,t1_cpn9teq,I never said anything about toss needing to all in without photon overcharge that was your belief just like I never assumed anything about your play. The changes from WOL are also what you said. With photon overcharge no toss needs to turtle which is my point. You say oracle expand but you actually mean  gate fe into oracle proxy or not because I really doubt that you wait for the stargate to come down with enough gas before putting down the nexus. Terran is forced to either choose to expand and then tech or tech then expand. Hence you see the  rax fe into a second rax or  rax into factory for the  fe or even  then fe. In the first scenario most terrans build a reactor which I guess you are calling teching when it is really just expanding your production infrastructure and in the other scenario they decide to forgo production in favor of teching to a factory. Protoss doesnt have this qualm because of warp gate so no matter what they will always have units appear whenever they want. So even if I tech first I can just warp in my defense later where as with terran I actually need to build my defense and time out the production. Thats why in a lot of WOL games you saw a moveout without medivacs from the terran because they built alot of army units that are putting them behind economically but because of the photon overcharge you see a fake poke to force the overcharge into a double drop from with stim combat shields and  attack at around  minutes.  minutes is the first time in HOTS when you see any form of terran attack if they choose to fe at all otherwise you are dealing with a  which is an allin from the terran because they cannot catchup if the attack fails to do any economic damage.I also like how every time you are kinda outmaneuvered in this trolling session you just pick something else to talk about. Like how I havent addressed your point. Your point keeps changing every chance you get and you also like to make up arguments from me. My point in the very beginning was that this defense was only made possible because of photon overcharge. I never suggested anything about removing it from the game that was your interpretation based on the thread but I didnt say it. The parent comment above me said that the defense was not only due to photon overcharge because lilbow did something sick but in fact the defense was only possible because photon overcharge existed seeing as you are desperate to say that photon overcharge is balanced and dont want to see it removed from the game. I get the feeling that you rely on it very heavily to do a lazy man defense rather than being on point with forcefields and army positioning.,starcraft,cpnb386,0,t5_2qpp6

3489042,0,t1_cppwnmv,Its pretty simple.  They have to take into account single core computers running v games.  The way the engine works all parties in a game basically run in parallel which is why you have the drop screen when one of the players falls too far outside the accepted lag radius.  The benefit of this is that basically anybody can play StarCraft on low settings.  The cost of this is that even if you have a K youll be running on one core and thus have massive limitations on what you can do at once.  If Blizzard upgrades their engine to be optimized towards multicore GPUs CPUs they will open the opportunity to execute a lot of things that are being requested at the cost of abandoning support for the lowest tier computers.Im on honestly on board with that just leaving behind the LCD but as it currently stands the way they designed their game engine  doesnt give them a lot of breathing room.

Youll also see stuff like  reaper or  mins which is shorthand for when a reaper a terran unit is finished or you have  minerals.edit Some more advice builds are just strong openings that people have developed.

Storms banelings archons colossus and melee units you have to stutter step all pose threats if you cant micro. All of whom are a good comp against bio and are often present in equal army supply banelings excluded but more deadly against the bad microer.And while I see your point I cant but to still help feel it is about the comp and the ability to adapt.

No one said that last part at all obviously itll get shit done my point is that in every league up until GMpro level itll almost always be cost effective which is a problem.But my whole point to this comment train is that it gets the job done TOO WELL.  Many higher players have pointed out that it seems to be just replacing the collossus and adding EVEN MORE aoe to the Protoss arsenal.  Its getting nerfed counterplay that relies totally and completely on the Protoss player messing up isnt counterplay at all.Look at the other units even.  The cyclone is obviously getting nerfed its like they made the warhound into an RC car.  And the ravenger is in a weird spot as well in that theres no point in NOT upgrading a roach if you have the money.  It needs a drawback because right now its just a better roach.OK I KEEP FEELING LIKE THE BADGUY BECAUSE IM SHITTING ON THE NEW UNITS SO ILL END THIS HEREI think the cyclone is the most broken right now its getting nerfed.  I think the adept is cool but should be tweaked so that its more than a protoss take on the reaper.  The disrupter is also too strong it needs to have a more reliable way to stop it especially with the changes to the Warpprism range Im iffy on this but as long as the disrupter changes I think itll be ok.  I think the Ravenger is also cool counterplay to forcefields is great and I love the morphing mechanic as a whole but it needs a damage or tankiness nerf to flesh out its roll as a supportzoning unit not a godroach.  The lurker is cool people just need to figure out how to use it base defense? idk  And finally all the other changes seem ok like the viper spell carrier speed etc. we just have to see how they play out from here as its only early beta.,starcraft,cpz5raw,2,t5_2qpp6

3600642,0,t1_cq2cwqv,I havent mentioned the definition of overpowered because I thought that would be common knowledge nor did I think itd be necessary to list all the reasons because its not exactly the first time wm balance is discussed. Wm being OP was an offshot from the topic to boot. But Ill oblige.Something is overpowered when there is an unfair advantage be it in cost skillrequirements health range attack etc. Of course when comparing different units it can be difficult to determine what makes something unfair since most units are not alike but widow mine and banelings share very similar traits when it comes to function and so they shouldnt differentiate too much in other values as well but they do. The only advantages that banelings have over widow mines are. they dont deal friendly fire. they have slightly larger splash radius. they dont take as much supply. they can attack when unburrowed. they can attack buildings.In every other aspect widow mines beats banelings hard. Widow mines. ranged . antiair . more damage . more health . have lower attack priority when unburrowed. attack ignores armor . no max damage cap banelings are suicide units so theres a cap on how much damage possible they can deal widow mines can be reused so no damage cap . high single target damage making them good against almost any unit as long as they can hit. costs less.Now you may be thinking costs less?! NO THEY DONT! Widow mines cost  minerals more! but thats not making a fair comparison not to mention  minerals is pocket change in that regard. Yes a baneling costs  while a widow mine costs  but notice that Im emphasizing units in singular. A baneling cant kill shit without upgrades a widow mine is basically at maximum performance from the getgo. So to actually kill anything with banelings you need at least  which would total to  minerals and  gas. I.e. widow mines are cheaper. The only bad thing about them is the friendly fire. And even so some of the advantages banelings have is not that big of a deal. Takes less supply? They are suicide units so you have to constantly resupply. Factor that in and zergs have to spend more supply on banelings than terrans do on widow mines anyway. Can attack buildings? The army value to kill any building costs more than the building they kill. It also makes no difference that widow mines cant kill buildings if the enemy dont have units to kill buildings with which clearly widow mines can do better. Then theres of course balance regarding forcing splits and such but that is skill based and as such its a subjective thing so Ive left that out of the list my stance is widow mines outperformes banelings even here.Sooooo do they sound balanced to you?Edit formatting,starcraft,cq2p6g0,1,t5_2qpp6

Sorry with the former I happen to like their consoles and dislike the PC master race mentality and thus take offense with his anger and with the latter Ive been hoping for better visual novels to come to Steam and theyve been the exception rather than the rule.

If no missile turrets are up the game is basically over.Thats one of the biggest problems with banshee play.  Zerg with only a mineral investment can push all that back and stall you until the allimportant mutas hit the field.  Once that happens basically say goodbye to your harass.

Point  is easy to refute as blind counters against build orders happen ALL the time. I guess people at the GSL should get accused every time they get blind countered. For point  scanning a gold base is feasible for various reasons. Was Avilo behind in the game with his only chance of winning to ninja a gold base?

Roach vs Roach in ZvZ tends to go something like this.... both players max out on roaches and start to trade then they slowly add in infestorshydras and eventually vipers. Sometimes a player will skip vipers and go straight to broodlords however which usually just wins the game assuming they get to broodlords before being hit with the roachhydraviper timing. Once the other player has broodlords its too late to just throw down a spire and try to make corruptors... At least if vipers could abduct the other player would still have a chance to win.,starcraft,cqp7d47,1,t5_2qpp6

3826569,0,t1_cqsgjfs,there are several possible answers but here are some of the reasons the map on maps that have  possible spawns you will sometimes want to send your reaper directly to the right base thats why you send an SCV early per example on a map such as Catallena Deadwing or Merry Go Round. Another reason to that would be a metagame reason Zergs have taken the habit of sometimes opening pool first and making  Zerglings to cancel the lowground CC the SCV is there to scout it so that the CC can be put on the highground. Mindgames if you are sending an SCV you can sometimes trick the Zerg in not making zerglings so that your reapers can do some drone damage. This is the less credible option at the top level though since Zergs are so good about mitigating those damages via spore cancels.,starcraft,cqsglzj,1,t5_2qpp6

When you see in this particular exemple a terran starting to load his medivac when he wants to drop youll see the marines go in and a white bar fill up under the hp of the medivac.

People complain all the time about widow mines  not just shitty players  because something so effortless can just end a game.Disruptors are the same way. Banelings are not.Hearthstone and LoL are popular for a reason  simplicity yet still requiring skill.Starcraft simply put requires too much skill to even play at a basic level and thus its dying in favor of more simple games. Everyone wants to posture and say get better because the SC scene is all about shitting on bronzies or Goldies or whatever.

For example the Novel Starcraft II Heavens Devils came out before the game SC and explains how Rayner came to know Tychus thus also explaining why he trusts him so much. Also it gets loosely mentioned in the campaign if I remember correctly. Havent seen more yet so that should suffice for now.Also your general argumentation is pretty weak. It IS explained during the campaign why Mengsk and Raynor are now enemies.

3910852,0,t1_cr21z0p,Thanks the reply!! Didnt expect to get a quick respond. After the approval would it still consider season  top ? or should I start working on season  NA ladder instead?? For future invites?This invite wave can create confusion as I wouldve rather grind the relative easier region. Without any way to check out own MMR how would we be able to know if we will get in or not? For scenario like this it actually makes me think it is a good idea Blizzard to have MMR rating for players to look at on ladder. If MMR really can be higher than someone in a high league than you then this really defeats the whole purpose of laddering. Is there data really showing that this is the case?I think everyone is really eager to get into BETA and more transparency would really help.

3967643,0,t3_35w0cy,I got some coaching from QXC a while ago one of the main things I asked him was how I can break through my peak and become more effective at improving my skill without having to grind crazy amounts of game. He basically said thisPlay in spurts and have your goal be to play your absolute best not the goal of just winning games or reaching a ladder rank. When you get the time play quite a handful of games in a day. About . hours of really intense play like do not let your foot off the gas play HARD and then stop when you start feeling burnt out or youre just playing bad. Then take a day or two away from the game completely dont even think about StarCraft. Then when you come back youll be able to play at that level and add on a little more into your play. He said what this does is give time for your brain to adjust and recover from the intense mental fatigue that comes from playing a game like StarCraft that hard kind of like a body builder who is doing really heavy weight training. If you continue to lift really hard with no breaks every day or you just grind average weight constantly with no breaks you wont improve at least not effectively.Needless to say this simple method of onoff hard playing has worked for me.

4102046,0,t1_crnou5k,I think your perspective is quite biased. SC is far from being an RTS masterpiece.The game has been plagued with core game design flaws since the first days of beta. Back in the day when LoL didnt even exist on twitchjustin.tv and SC was the No. viewed game with zero competition. HoN was the only popular moba back then but it was no match for the hype and momentum SC had. Sometimes I wonder if anyone here remembers those times.Fast forward to this day and the game has been in a steady and brutal decline while other competitive games  like Dota LoL CSGO  have been steadily growing. And this is only logical since twitch and esports are becoming more popular. Dont you think this contradiction is a bit strange?Can you really attribute this decline in the starcraft is too hard and not a game for everyone catchphrase? I wont specifically mention the game design issues that people have brought up a hundred thousand times on the official forums and on this subreddit during the last four years. But to sum it up the game is volatile and becomes stale very easily. Its nervewracking to play not because its demanding but because losing feels cheap for the amount of effort the game requires and watching it becomes boring very quickly. Its so easy to tell who will win before theres even a battle while  of the games immediately end after one big engagement. ,starcraft,crnuwyn,4,t5_2qpp6

4125504,0,t1_crqispc,if youd have stalked me harder youd have seen me play. Most of the time when i lose against someone of equalish skill level as me its because i severely botch an engagement then lose directly afterwards. Like i said my micro isnt great. If hes worse than me i generally lose to some sort of cheese. If hes better than me its because he just has more stuff and i cnat take super efficient head on engagements because again my micro is fairly ass. Its a reoccuring theme. please note that i use the word generally generally means not all the time just most of the time.You remind me a bit of someone who talked to me a little while ago. He was trying to say i was a plat player and dilusional for thinking im high diamond which is where im currently ranked and have been ranked for  seasons. His only evidence was having watched me play a few games on my stream in january. January. The difference between you and him though is that you dont have any evidence other than one conversation a bit of internetstalking and a whole lot of assumptions. I stopped talking to him because it was an excercise in futility. I feel like this is turning into the same thing.

4176081,0,t1_crvr12t,I can kinda see the point in it when you lose a game due to events outside of your control  for example another lane in DotA  League feeding extremely early on making mistakes dying and giving the enemy team gold by that someone keeps getting caught alone and dying repeating the same mistake over and over again or a completely random effect in Hearthstone losing you the game Ragnaros hitting face for lethal when you had  minions on the board. In such situations its possible that you had barely any impact on the game and while you mightve been able to prevent it early gank to aid that lane having more minions out to improve your chances of survival the events that led to the loss were very unlikely.In Starcraft? Absolutely no point maybe when you get matched up against a Diamond  Master as Bronze  Silver and get completely outplayed thats probably not really enjoyable but otherwise you could make an impact on everything that happens in the game and as such losing is at least partially your fault.,starcraft,crwa24s,0,t5_2qpp6

From Silver I climbed to rank  platinum within a few months it was tougher than it sounds because of all the smurf accounts.

4224062,0,t1_cs14cmh,The volatility of ZvZ is non issue PvP has similar aspects with hard BO counters and lack of overall perfectly safe play with plenty of chance involved. One could argue that PvP is more applicable to what youre saying in regard to chance than ZvZ.I still disagree with the notion that basic deduction is too difficult. You state it is next to impossible to get lings or drones in at the exact moment that lings spawn  I agree. However this is not a necessity as the overlord that should be sitting both behind the natural spotting drone count and the overlord at the front of the natural combined with ling pokes and scouts is more than enough scouting to know if your opponent is flooding lings there are soooo many tell tale signs. You seem to be completely ignoring facts of scouting that I am laying out right in front of you so that you can claim there is no way to figure out what a zerg is making. With that mentality we might as well make sure muta switches cant kill protoss by allowing them to know exactly when mutas are being produced post spire with different colours for muta eggs. Or maybe we do not want terrans to die to roach all ins so lets change the colour of eggs for roaches so that reapers can easily scout them.The difference between luckily spotting an egg that is a different colour with a pair of lings that just so happens to make it past queens and lings at a perfectly integral point of the game and seeing lings exiting the natural is so minute that it does not really make much of a difference in terms of defending it. The likelihood of a pair of lings getting in proximity of eggs when your opponent is doing a cheeky ling all in is not very high. If they do then you have a perfect example of someone who is not as well versed in execution or scouting denial  an integral aspect of ZvZ.If you need an example of skill being a measurable metric in terms of the better player succeeding take a look at Jaedong vs Gungfupanda. Jaedong being the better player between the two was able to hold off an attack that was literally a build order loss for him. Skill is a measurable metric. I myself numerous times have held off  pools and  pool banes with  hatch  pool which are considered  build order losses for the vast majority of people. In those games I was a better player. To excuse the concept of skill and understanding and attempt to validate your argument based on high level statistical metrics without examining the context of those games very thoroughly is incredibly naive. Judging by your current understanding of ZvZ I honestly dont think examining the context yourself would do much anyway.These kinds of things need to exist to maintain depth in the game. If as you are proposing early ling floods and timings were completely removed from ZvZ what would be left with? Games where the first  minutes are just drones. Then what happens well both sides will make roaches and well see macro into mass roach vs roach fights every ZvZ with little to no action prior. There will be no reason to be that cautious anymore and no way for players participating in best ofs to throw their opponent off and  or punish them for greed making for incredibly linear game play where those builds are no longer viable.To remove inherent complexity from a game designed to be strategic and require you to think in favour of making things easier for the player would drastically reduce the watchability of the game in terms of esports. Many people enjoy watching this game far more than playing it I myself have recently quit SC in favour of Brood War as I enjoy playing that game much more however I still enjoy watching SC because of things like this. Brood War has stagnated in many ways in terms of watchability the match ups have become linear albeit still exciting and just not as on the edge of your seat inducing while watching. So it is literally one or the other.,starcraft,cs1pzdy,1,t5_2qpp6

4243106,1,t3_39ha9a,my largest issue with the GSL is this web page  and it lists that if you have over K WCS points and over K that you have to per the blizzard license offer a free p english stream. keep in mind that is a REQUIREMENT of the blizzard license to see GSL flaunt the fact that they arent obeying the terms of their license makes me wonder why others arent similarly. Blizzard needs to start enforcing the license terms.the issue is that while the GSL may not see advertising revenue from me they have a global audience they once were a korean broadcast but they arent limited to that scope anymore.They have access to global brands i.e. mcdonalds cocacola etc. A great example of that iswas the fragbite masters sponsered by colmhem and mcdonalds. they played ads for both and they are a considerably smaller tournament and a smaller audience but still had an international sponsor. it seems to me to be a nearly xenophobic response to anything that isnt their specific culture this is not just a korean thing but seems to be a general asian belief that only their culturenationality matters. japan has a similar culture. its almost engrained in most asian communities that if its an outside influence it doesnt need to be followed or that it isnt as good as the current way. again this is a general statement. but its time that BLIZZARD started to enforce the terms of their license and im sure that the terms include public demonstrations in the TOS which would effectively shut down GSL. blizzard has hit a point where the GSL needs blizzard not the other way around.IMHO we should start looking to the future and the more that they want to be isolated the more we should give them what they want and leave them alone.,starcraft,cs3wl70,4,t5_2qpp6
4244102,0,t3_39k132,You have to consider that Smash Brothers was never planned to be a competitive game and the skill of the players resulted from those players finding bugs and learning that animations can be cancelled.

4256089,0,t1_cs5c2pc,Ok. I see what you mean though I disagree that luck is necessarily something that will please casual players. I think its more that players want to win or at least feel powerful with minimal effort on their part people just want to get in the game kill a lot of things and distinctively feel like theyre the ones killing said things. Its part of why MOBAs are so popular heroes are powerful units right from the get go and theyre also easy to relate to as they are singular characters.I thought a little bit about luck in the context of the modern iterations of CoD. When players get unlucky and die it provides the main source of frustration on the other hand lucky players quickly feel a disconnect between their own skill level and the kills they accrue. CoD and MW remain the most beloved in the series and I think its because they provided players with plenty of effortless powerful killing methods which also were directly controllable by the player themselves and scaled with skill or knowledge.In other words I think the experience has to both feel more rewarding and be easy at the entry level in order for casual players to be attracted to gameplay. This would have the effect of losing having minimal impact as alluded to by uwildfyre when winning a match is not the only obvious feeling of satisfaction available and people can have fun just by playing and killing a lot of stuff,starcraft,cs5dn7o,1,t5_2qpp6

If its so much more like BW and a lot more fun then SCII then Id like to see what kind of an impact this mod could have.Maybe it could attract the current BW scene Bisu Effort Last etc. or even compete the current SCII scene in Korea.Id rather see a back and forth match like the ones in Starbow the the current way SCII is being played where everything has a time windowTvZ Great matchup that requires a lot of agression from both sides to take the advantage. Zerg needs to deal enough damage to deny the Terran victorypush while Terran cannot leave the Zergs Macro unhindered.ZvP Zerg has to try and kill Protoss before they can either push to victory or deathball the Zerg to Death.TvP Terran has to defend Protoss Agressive Allins while also having to deal enough damage pick the Protoss apart with drops or SCVpull Allin before P can build up their AoE Deathball which is extremely difficult when P is Turteling on base.Mirror matchups are a different story ZvZ and PvP have boring Metas basically they will always fall back to the same composistions.

4272977,0,t1_cs6f9v7,So far Ive not found any of them to be bad overall apart from the fact that pretty much every one of them is a variant on the stock standard ones that have been made for the last few years and I havent played much since  so I would imagine they have not suddenly become worse.  My opinion is that peoples opinions on the maps are based on the new design changes and units which are showing flaws in the HOTS style of map design.  An example of this is flat ground chokes near expansions that  allow a Terran to abuse the new tank pickup mechanic by blocking the choke with bunkers and microing tanks back and forth to pick at the expansion.  Ive done this several times to test it and it is incredibly strong which IMO is a map problem BUT rewards good macro players and punishes bads who will stockpile a buttload of resources if they are not quick enough to spend their shit without dying to a bust.  The new tank lift is not imbalanced at least not in TvT or TvZ in fact it makes tanks MUCH more viable against mutaling banes by giving an escape option from the now faster mutas that were buffed back in .,starcraft,cs7a5y0,1,t5_2qpp6

The only real strain on the computer at that point is just a network call to retrieve data and some library calls to render the visuals. I cant imagine it being firewall cpu or gpu related if its only happening there. Its more than likely a hdd issue or software issue and in a rare circumstance an amd driver issue.I recommend running chkdsk first then use the battle.net launcher to repair the game.

4297019,0,t3_3a7jfm,His post for those who cant view forums some of the best stuff in bold. gtWe wanted to touch on the chat channel topic a bit here. We know we havent provided a lot of details on this and we wanted to give some more information on these changes and let you know what to expect in future beta patches.  gtThe chat changes have been something weve planned since the start of beta. Wed seen a lot of feedback from players looking for ways to improve the social experience and we wanted help address this by starting with the chat channel changes. When looking at the changes we wanted to make we felt implementing a modified version of the chat style used in Heroes of the Storm would be a good starting point. It has a lot of the basic elements we were looking for and had already been extensively tested in this engine. However from there we had planned to diverge from the functionality that existed in Heroes and make changes that would be directed towards the StarCraft experience. Were currently working on some of these changes and we plan to have some implemented in the major beta patch. gtSome of the upcoming changes actually address a few of the points mentioned earlier.gtgt  PMPosted by TheSkunkgtgtThe ability to condense chats but still have the option to split them off into separate tabs because both the old gtgtchat and the new chat can get messygtWell still have channels but youll now have the option to isolate to a single channel through a drop down menu at the top left corner of the chat. It will list all the channels youre currently a part of. You wont be able to break out into separate windows but this new versions keeps everything tidy while also making it very clear which channels you are in and allows you to quickly move around to them.gtgt  PMPosted by TheSkunkLet players resize the chat andor make it larger by default as long as that can be done without blockingcovering up other UI elements. Many players complain the new chat is too smallhard to read and the small size necessitates the removal of useful features like the channel member list additionally the small size makes it feel unimportant.gtThe width of the chat window will be increased as well as the height. Additionally there will be an option to make the height even larger than the new default size. Along with this we plan to adjust some of the UI elements around the chat window so the increased chat window size doesnt interfere with key functionality. The channel member list will also be readded. The new list will be contained in the single chat window but it will show the participants of all channels youre currently a part of. There will be a header for each chat channel youre in with the members list for that channel underneath. You can expand or collapse these headers depending on which member lists youd like visible. This makes it easy to quickly figure out who is in each channel.gtWe hope that this new version will introduce some new improvements to the new functionality introduced in the last patch. Well continue to iterate and add polish to this feature and we welcome your continued feedback in this area.,starcraft,cs9zwfk,2,t5_2qpp6

4313757,0,t1_csbjxx4,Ghost was perfect the maps were at fault. They were OP against Zerg because claustrophobic maps meant slow units like the ghost can sit in one location and dominate everywhere. With a larger map the original ghosts wouldnt look so overpowered as flocks of mutalisks run rings around the slow moving ghosts and one moment caught out of position means banelings crashing into your expensive tier  bio. Even in the current meta mutas are able to outposition and do damage against stimmed marines and speedboosted medivacs. Ghosts are not overpowered MVP was just better than the competition at that point in time and the map design helped make it unstoppable.Then they nerfed snipe so theres no reason to get them in TvZ. Then they changed it from  to  so its not even economical to build them with bio vs. Protoss hence why almost nobody at a high level makes them anymore. In the process of balancing the ghost they also made it extinct in TvTs.

But assuming players are playing badly is very strange.gtHave  marines which isnt hardMost common terran builds cant even get out  marines in time for a fast oracle. Marines are fine for later ones though.gtwidow mines actually kill fighting units where oracles cant really stand up to army unitsUnupgraded marines cant even fight toetotoe with oracles which are harassment units and shouldnt be strong straightup.gtFinally theres asymmetric balance. A Terran loses  SCVs thats bad. A Protoss loses  SCVs its game over.This is true.  Another thing is that mines rely on protoss mistakes to do real damage. If mines are unscouted protoss can sorta salvage the situation with good crisis management.

Being it economic greed by only getting one reaper which you then  have to scv scout if you go for a low ground expand or being aggressive with multiple reapers because zerg does not build that many zerglings.The most important difference between  and  is your hellion timing after going for  reapers.  Reapers is the norm at the moment if you go for reapers at all. I do not want to cover every single possibility but just showcase what this one opening transitions into and how it react to all the stuff zerg can do to you.Also if you are not at least GM I personally think the difference between a  and  in terms of workers is totally irrelevant as you will miss workers anyways I actually covered the  reaper into marine opening in another Forsaken Favorites Episode but I think it was in german at that time Dthanks for your feedback though highly appreciated glhf!Edit Also if you see pool before hatch into gas you can stop at  reapers  no need to get  then!Edit Lastly with safe I mean can defend anything reasonably well. ,starcraft,cstvpa4,3,t5_2qpp6

I think to some degree thats a function of time once LotV is completely balanced around  years after its release it should get a lot less random as the skill of players starts to plateau and the meta starts to stabilize a bit more. In beta right now its really hard to understand the ZvP meta for instance I hardly ever hit Protosses. It seems clear that the matchup is still in its infancy borrowing a lot from HotS still.

Bomber and Polt are comparable players and Bomber has improved over last year by returning to Korean. As for BunnyLilbow yea...

The siege tank pickup is crucial because its the only midgame option that terran has to lurkers and it allows them to escape if they get flooded. And when im optimistic the siege drop gets removed it allows the terran to completely cancel the unsiege animation which is in my opinion good healthy micro.Oh yeah and another reason I want lurkers to unburrow slower is because a ravagers memeblast can be avoided. The way I see it ravagers are good siege units earlymid game but they might need a few buffs.

4595664,0,t1_ct9to45,gtMost notably WG removes defenders advantage for Z and T by allowing P to instantly get a batch of gateway units to the frontline in the event of a fight whereas Z and T reinforcements must physically travel to the fight. This makes fighting Protoss very difficult as you have fight  supply plus another  supply five seconds after the start of the fight while your reinforcements will have to be built and walk there taking much longer to actually make an impact.A fair point but since you can only warp in gateway units if you run out of other units run out of FFs run out of storms any of these factors then theres no amount of things you can warp in that would help you. Zerg and Terran with enough production will also produce units in bursts and if theyre under attack they will come out at roughly the same rate as Protoss units if not faster especially in the case of Zerg. If anything warpins are weaker on the front lines but stronger at home where they can be reinforced with stronger units that have to be produced normally.gtWG is such a powerful tool PvP matches in WoL hinged entirely on those early proxy pylons and gate cheeses to the point that Blizz had to introduce the MSC and nexus cannon  and the host of design issues it came with for ZvP and TvP  just to give P some element of defenders advantage in PvP.I dont understand the design issues of the MSC. It was a great tool that added a lot of versatility to all the matchups. Protoss actually has multiple viable openings and transitions now. Even in LotV it was given more options by making Recall cheaper.gtForcefields are also a major problem because unlike other forms of micro there is nothing the other player can do about it for most of the game. Most notably good or bad forcefields are what the entirety of the ZvP matchup can hinge on as the only Z solution to FF  Ultras  are bad against Immortals and can be kited by Colossi especially with good use of cliff walk.FFs are on a fragile unit with less range than a Hydra. Just watch Snutes games against Rain and Classic and tell me how much of a problem FFs are. Good flanking baiting out FFs theyre all interesting tactics and Im not sure they would exist otherwise. In LotV theyre weak enough to barely be featured in games at all.I mean the fact you say other races cant deal with FFs without UltraThor is just such an uninformed opinion. I have barely seen any pro games where the players did what you described. If that was truly the only solution we would see it every game that went late. The solution to FFs is use the mobility of your race to not be put into a bad position. If you allow Protoss to get inside your base and FF you out its the same as them zoning you out with disruptors storms or colo. Its your own fault for letting them up there. Zerg and Terran are also very tough to deal with when theyre camping your production.Youre framing these issues as balance concerns but the balance is fine right now. Youre not talking about design at all and Im not convinced that the things youve mentioned are design problems. In fact the only thing youve really said about them is that they annoy you.Also you didnt mention it but the thing you linked mentions nerfing colo range and damage. They did that in LotV and now theyre WORTHLESS. I think theres a huge disconenct between what people think is a good idea and what actually happens. When they nerfed warpgate in LotV they made it so difficult for protoss that they unnerfed it. The community finally got what they wanted and realized it was terrible for the game.,starcraft,ct9vihw,1,t5_2qpp6

If the drones did  damage you could pull all the drones mineral walk them to get them to hit the supply wall eventually cracking it and letting the zerglings true.

Send out to harass Terran early.       Recall is a spell Protoss must have. It has endless utility. Just not as it is in SCII.      Saves Protoss from being inept in the early game.                  Bad          Only allowed one of the unit with recall.        Recall sucks as it is.         Promotes turtling and does best in a deathball.

4641098,0,t1_ctfk519,I agree with you as well as with the post youre responding to.Youre right in the sense that maps need to be changed to accomodate Protoss play that Protoss has weaknesses that require fixing in a design perspective which would make the game better for all three races instead of just for Protoss. Personally I wouldnt mind one bit losing the MSC Ive never liked the unit. Ive never liked being required to use it because its so important.The thing is though that Protoss also has qualities that people like about the race. Using all kinds of different caster units in perfect sync to completely decimate an army is hard to do but also very fun. People say forcefielding off part of an army has no counter play but there are several ways you can get out of it. Just because some might not be available to you at that point might not be the Protoss players fault. When a Terran stims bio and snipes colossi is that because Stimpack has no counter play or because the position of the Protoss was bad? I feel like some hate towards the Protoss is being blamed on design whereas thats not always where the problem lies.So in short  while I agree with you that the MSC isnt good and with its removal opens up interesting different design changes to Protoss. The parent post is right in the sense that people hate on Protoss so much and the talk is so extremely negative that its super demoralizing for players who like certain aspects of current Protoss play. Its not like a complete makeover into a different race is necessary yet thats what many people say in this reddit.,starcraft,ctfksa6,2,t5_2qpp6

4704770,0,t3_3fbnzb,I prefer Option  of the macro choicesHowever I would say get rid of the Inject larvae alltogether but rather allow individual hatcheries spend a low cost    or   . This upgrade on the individual upgrade increases the spawn rate of larvae on that specific hatchery. This would allow for production for Zerg to feel more spread out such as  hatcheries in a main meaning drops become less damaging should a hatchery get sniped. This would ALSO give room for making queens a more solid unit a more interesting unit. This allows for buffing the Queen in areas suchas AntiAir damage maybe adding an upgrade for the Queen to have an offcreep speed bonus strengthening the areas of Zerg where they feel their AA is weak.Having an autocast spell seems.. odd to me out of place. It doesnt showcase skill very much and I feel like with more hatcheries you can share the feeling you get with creep spread example Wow Life has over  hatcheries and  of the map is covered in Creep he is SUPER ahead. So now you have the visual of macro as well as the creep spread mechanic both being shown.,starcraft,ctnko98,4,t5_2qpp6

4713479,0,t1_ctonocb,Wow. That was extremely informative thank you very much. Now sort of related but when you said gtthe bandwith usage during the game is virtually non existentThis surprises me. I have a pretty good computer that should theoretically I think? run sc easily at high maybe even ultra without FPS issues.  Yet even with medium I get FPS drops and general latency when I play and Ive always attributed it to having background applications that use bandwith like Skype youtubetwitterreddit on Chrome running hogging my bandwith and choking idk if this is the correct use of the term StarCraft.  Is this just my internet connection speed or is this related to what you say about the SC using only  cores?Aside from that although a lot to process again it was an extremely informative post so thank you. As a sort of comprehension check is it fair to make a summary like this?SC is run on each users computer instead of on a single server so their computers have the burden of performance but will not necessarily perform better with more cores in their CPUs.  This also allows for maphacks which can only be stopped by raising the performance standard to an unreasonable level.,starcraft,ctoo8lh,1,t5_2qpp6

4717142,0,t1_ctowuj3,You make good points but I dont think making something new will be less time consuming unless its more or less identical for each race and  quite simple. With the game having hardly any certainty right now itd be hard to balance new mechanics anyways. But lets entertain that ideaCB inject and mules are gone. What happens to Zerg? Open up with a macro hatch or instant  bases? Or does Zerg now automatically get all these larva which is an insane buff because they can make  drones in stead of each queen in the early game. For Terran it seems simpler scvs should produce faster and they will not upgrade to orbital for a while. Protoss could remain the same but maybe also decrease probe build time a bit. Id like to try it ingame but to me it sounds bland.No more queen snipes killing larvae contaminating hatches building queens in general is more questionable which to me is a shame considering Zerg anti air in the early game and the decision to pull a queen off macro duty to defend is gone. Automated injects would partially solve this but Zerg macro seems simpler as it is already unless you focus heavily on creep. Protoss has less flexibility in builds scouting for chrono or nexus energy is over. Terran never has to save for scans and sniping mules in the early game is over. Terran comeback potential will be shattered using mules for repair is gone. No more manner mules.What do we gain? More opportunity to micro units. But this can also be gained by tweaking the existing mechanics while retaining a lot of these fun aspects of the game. Im not sold on removing them even though in an ideal world the game could be better of. Its just not a practical way to go about it unless Blizzard has it figured out already.,starcraft,ctp4ucb,1,t5_2qpp6

4723904,0,t3_3fmmuq,I think its a brilliant idea and one that Ive been thinking about how it could be implemented.You could do placements whereby everyone starts at easy level but because the better players will do everything a lot cleaner have better micro better macro management etc they will be placed in the higher leagues but all players have the option to decline and be placed in bronze league.Then you could have an option whereby if a player is promoted say from silver to gold they can decline if they dont want to improve their skill ceiling and learn new mechanics. But since they have qualified for the higher league they should always have the option during that season to be promoted and until they take the option they can use unranked to play with the new mechanics while still laddering normally. This gives lower level players the knowledge that they can play at a higher league but also gives them time to learn the new mechanics instead of being battered by platsdiamonds depending on their MMR.,starcraft,ctpzkni,1,t5_2qpp6

4727519,0,t1_ctqbcw3,gt The only unaddressed issue of the article was the lack of choice Zergs have to use injects. Protoss and Terran can play at a much higher level without using their macro mechanic at all while Zerg would be much more gimped.Actually the article addresses this point in Zerg a special case. Macro mechanics is not just injects mules and chrono but includes all base building and production. For example zerg can create supplyoverlords without looking at their bases but terran and protoss have to look at their base and shift queue the workers back to mining each time they want to build supply there is a similar lack of choice in constantly having to look back at your base and place buildings and the other two races also have do a lot more base building that zerg. The queen inject forces zerg to imitate the macro requirements of the other races. Meaning zerg would be a whole lot easier than the other races if the inject requirement is removed and everything left as it is now.,starcraft,ctqg00j,1,t5_2qpp6

Yes some strategies can be annoying but the same could be said about OKW. Sturmpioneers Kubelwagen Puma etc.... The randomness is stupid. I cant agree more. Not killing the tank just because the last missle missed a grenade having the potential to either kill a whole squad or almost nothing and your example are great examples for one of the biggest flaws in COH. When I read  your answer though I think you are way too OKW biased. For you it seems like nothing negative happens to allies PThe meta gets more and more figured out.

The hack relies on the fact that the multiplayer is PP so both clients have full access to all the data in the current game instead of only the data of the units you can see. In SC the data is sent from your client to the enemys client via Battle.net servers but the data is not modified in any way by the Battle.net servers. In other games the data is collected by the server and then only the data relevant to each client is sent out in Dota and LoL you never have access to data concerning units outside of visual range you do in SC.

Its a competition of the best players in Europe China and the Americas plus a half a dozen Korean players that spend most of the year in the best training environment in the world that none of the other players have the slightest bit of access to one of whom will inevitably win this tournament.

Forcing queens to be there create an impactful harassment target as well as forces as investment from the zerg to get this production bump ie your method might produce scary allins.I agree with the harassment point but not the investment point. I dont understand why you think OPs method will produce scary allins.Building a macro hatch is quite the investment actually whereas Queens are not an investment as were more or less forced to build them.Off of hatch  queen in about  seconds the hatches naturally spawn  larva each and the queens inject once each for  additional larva so larvaseconds. It costs  hatchdrone  x  total of  minerals takes up  supply with lost mining from  drone. With say  hatches youre getting  larva seconds. It costs  minerals lost mining from  drones and give you  supply.Even if natural larva could be banked up to  the banking capability of Queens is still higher.Anyway the point is that Queens are no more of an investment than macro hatches and I dont understand why you think macro hatches with banking up to  is going to produce scary allins.,starcraft,cu66u29,0,t5_2qpp6

Against skytoss a single carrier would completely drain a PDD in ltsecond and the PDD would only block dmg.  Typically PDDs mostly only activate vs tempests where they block gtdmg over a long period of time.In much the same way when queen groundattack switched from melee to projectile it was a nerf to PDD as queen ground dps is irrelevant and it drains the charges that could have been used against the powerful corruptorssporehydra attacks.  When PDD stopped working vs broodlords it was a buff to terran as it allowed PDD to protect vikings from corruptors rather than be drained by the broodlords.,starcraft,cu68o3s,9,t5_2qpp6

4883747,0,t3_3hsa9l,It certainly is the biggest patch  so if you look at it from purely a magnitude standpoint  it might be the best patch.Otherwise about the changes that is only going to be subjective but yes i am very fucking worried that people are trying to rip the hearth of Starcraft  my lowering the skill ceiling  especially when LotV made the game much faster and less casual friendly in a big way.So  after the ultra fast expanding and look at your army or it all dies  abilities who in their right mind would think that removing macro mechanics would make the game casual friendlyAfter raising the skill ceiling in general and lowering the macro complexity the emphasis on micro is raised over macro. Who in their right mind can think that this does not change the core of Starcraft what makes it different from the other RTS titles. What seperated RTS titles on the most basic level is  races  complexity and the balance between macro and micro. Put emphasis on macro over micro and you get the AoE kind put emphasis on micro over macro and you get the Warcraft  kind. Starcrafts balance was just in the middle and not it is tilting to micro. It is unfortunate that there are not many RTS titles but people are trying to reflect what kind of RTS they prefer on Starcraft and shifting the core of it. And above all it is just sad that people believe macro mechanics are the solution to every problem  when it is not and the game has much deeper problems to fix and they are being kept awayThis game does not have fucking skirmishes goddamn it. Most of the action in it is Harassment and they are still buffing harassment to the point that it is always better to harass yourself rather than defending it since harassment is much harder to defend than to inflict. EVERYTHING IS MADE TO MASSACRE WORKERS!The economy in the game didnt not allow out expanding and saturation to break a turtling opponent. Right now it just does not allow turtling at all. Turtling is a strategy they only had to make it breakable instead they just deleted it.The units clump up and armies scale much better in high numbers than in low. That leads to deathballing and instead of making scaling different  they added antideathball units to discourage people from deathballing.

4889834,0,t3_3hvhym,I am a bot. For those of you at work I have tried to extract the text of the blue post from the us.battle.net forumsgtgt Community Feedback Update  August  gtgtDayvie  DevelopergtgtgtgtgtgtgtBefore we begin wed like to send a shoutout to the highest level progamers out there in Korea who are always looking to find new strategies counters to those strategies and doing all they can to find solutions to obstacles within the game. It is both inspiring and admirable to see top end players who work through significant adversity to adapt and find new strategies and tactics. In many of the topend prolevel HotS games this week we saw lots of interesting counters to certain strategies that were seen as unbeatable and it was awesome to be reminded that there are players out there who will explore things to find their own solutions rather than immediately jumping to extreme conclusions.gtgtgtgtHeart of the Swarm MechSwarm Host Balance Test MapgtgtWeve seen your feedback regarding TvZ mech play and we agree that certain mech games are dragging on too long. Weve seen a lot of potential in this area as well as some mech games have been packed with action. These have cultivated in unique max vs. max battles with heavy tech switches on the Zerg side.gtgtgtgtWith that said were testing these Swarm Host changesgtgtgtgt   Supply cost decreased from  to gtgtgtgt   Cost changed from  to gtgtgtgt   Locusts can fly without having the upgradegtgtgtgt   Locust health down from  to gtgt gtgtWe believe this could be a good change that helps against Terran mech and against Protoss in a fun way. To reiterate we dont want to jump to conclusions and we dont know if Zerg is underpowered against mech. With this test map we can prepare a patch if that turns out to be the case. Well try to get the test map up next week.gtgtgtgtNow lets talk about Legacy of the Void.gtgtgtgtProtoss Feels Gimmicky Compared to Other RacesgtgtThank you for discussions in this area this week. The main points that could contribute to the gimmicky feelings point toward offensive warpins which should be addressed with this weeks patch. So overall this is potentially a nonissue if testing goes smoothly with the new changes.gtgtgtgtWe didnt quite agree with some of the other main arguments in this area. We feel that the consequences of not scouting if the opponent is going for Oracles or a Dark Shrine is just StarCraft II not a case of Protoss being gimmicky. For example if Im going mech and I dont scout that the opponent is going fast Spire I could be at a huge disadvantage because my AA isnt out yet. The same goes for things like proxy cloaked Banshee Baneling bust or any strategy any race can do that requires scouting and reacting. Scouting is a critical component of StarCraft II and we want to increase its importance in Legacy of the Void. gtgtgtgtOur goal is to give players plenty of strategically viable openers in Void in order to have more action throughout the course of the game. Thats why were adding tools to other races including individual Overlord transport Liberator harassment Nydus changes Siege Tank Siege Mode drops and so on.gtgtgtgtWith that said more options arent always better. If a race just has so many options that they cant be effectively scouted we would obviously look into ways to either increase scouting capabilities for the other races or reduce some options on a race. We will definitely need to do a pass at this before the game launch so please remember to not be too quick to judge. Previous experience has shown that learning to defend something takes more time than going on the offensive with new tools. gtgtgtgtDuring beta tests small groups of players often arrive at conclusions concerning a topic and even though their assertion may no longer be the case they just cant let go. We encourage everyone to be more open minded in actually discussing and testing changes during this beta so that we can work towards having the best possible StarCraft II. gtgtgtgtIts one of the main reasons why were communicating with you more than ever beforeits unproductive to focus on preconceived notions while not paying attention to the actual state of the game.gtgtgtgtMothership Core Photon OverchargegtgtWeve been exploring a change to how this ability works based on your suggestions. Our current change is for the ability costs less to only be cast on Pylons and to no longer have siege range. Were seeing a lot more interaction with this ability use due to this change because now there are lots of decisions to be made on both sides. For example gtgtgtgtHow many Pylons need to be overcharged? gtgtHow many and what type of Pylon building placement is optimal in case Overcharge needs to be used?gtgtDo you avoid their firing radius kill the Pylon or run away? gtgtgtgtWe havent been too focused on this change recently but we will continue testing and hopefully make a call before the next balance update.gtgtgtgtColossusgtgtWe heard your feedback that the Colossus nerf was too much and regarding Colossi having a more general role like they do in Heart of the Swarm. Weve been testing Colossus in combination with Disruptors and the results are cool so far. We started playtesting with their upgraded range back to  and the combination of the redesigned Disruptors supported by Colossi looks to be going well. gtgtgtgtAdeptgtgtWe agree that early game Adepts can be a bit too powerful and we would like to see a greater variety in Protoss army compositions. We have been trying various suggestions internally and are leaning towards changing their cost from  to . This will slow down how many Adepts can be massed early on and in the later stages of the game itll be more of a commitment when going heavy Adepts. Another benefit that were seeing in the late game is that the army composition becomes more diverse due to the mineralstogas ratio. We will continue reviewing this internally and hopefully get it out to the beta if testing continues to go well.gtgtgtgtCarrier Interceptor BehaviorgtgtWed like to thank you for your suggestions in this area. Based on your feedback weve been exploring a change to issuing orders to the Interceptor. Even when Interceptors are starting to return to the Carrier it is now possible to issue a new order to have them instantly attack another target without having to first return to the Carrier. Weve put this change in this weeks balance patch.gtgtgtgtImmortalgtgtWe agree with your feedback in that the new ability is quite difficult to use for a majority of players and this ability might only impact the highestlevel of players out there. Therefore weve been trying out having the ability autocast by default. Were noticing that this change is allowing Protoss to be able to focus on the more important parts of engagements while Immortals continue to function at a high efficiency. At the same time in order to use the ability for maximum efficiency the highestlevel players who have the extra micro to spare should turn this off. Thank you for this suggestion and we will continue testing this change internally before making the call to have it go out to the beta.gtgtgtgtRavager UpgradegtgtWere playing around with a new Ravager upgrade internally that increases the cast range of Corrosive Bile from  to . The idea here is to have a stronger counter to Siege Tank and entice Terran players to use different unit compositions depending on how the Zerg is playing. For example if Zerg is going heavy HydraLurkers units like Liberators or Siege Tanks would be stronger whereas if Zerg is going heavy RoachRavagers Siege Tanks or Liberators might not be as strong as other units such as Cyclones or speedupgraded Banshees. gtgtgtgtFurther Learnings From Internal TestinggtgtFinally wed like to talk about a couple major changes suggested by our community that didnt quite turn out to have as positive of an effect as we had hoped. Weve been discussing and playtesting the following two areas internally and have decided that both are not fit for beta testing. gtgtgtgtgtgt   Reducing the number of workers per base so that army sizes become bigger gtgt gtgtgtgtWhen trying out this change we determined that reducing the workers needed per base isnt good for the game because many of the coolest moments i,starcraft,cuawhxs,4,t5_2qpp6

A better solution would be to keep manual injects but make them less punishing by moving some of the larva they produce over to the natural larva production of the hatchery. With this solution the net larva would be the same on players that hit all their injects but it would not be so punishing on those players that miss them from time to time. ,starcraft,cuu93kk,10,t5_2qpp6

Which this could be one possibility of control.The other major potential is with the xelnaga influence on Aiur Amon is controlling them from some form of temple or what not.Another one with the wild theory is that they still have their last directive from the original invasion of Aiur while wild they are still following that directive. As I would imagine feral zerg to be similar to that of what the other feral zerg did in previous campaigns. Which were pretty much just inactive chilling with no organization.

5146547,0,t1_cv6a2pq,Logically if you are saying that there is no skill in macro then you are implying the game is too easy for zerg if the game is too easy for zerg then they are overpowered? Complete nonsense. First of all the difficulty of a race has no implication on balance. A race could be super easy to master and still be the weakest. Secondly saying that a race is easy in one area does not necessarily mean that its easy overall. And lastly saying that autoinjects are a bad idea in no way implies that I think zerg is overpowered. It simply implies that I think its a bad idea in terms of game design. If you actually played some high level legacy during the auto inject patches you would know that the skill cap was simply too low for zerg macro. It just was. How could it not be? Injects were always by far the hardest part of Zerg macro. Arguably  of it. Removing that without compensation has to make the race way too easy in terms of macro. Maybe top players can squeez out some extra units every once in a while but that doesnt mean the skill cap wasnt too low. Ask any pro player and they will tell you the same. Auto injects were a bad Idea and Im glad they are gone. The new inject is a good compromise imo and was the way to go.,starcraft,cv6con7,1,t5_2qpp6
5148716,0,t1_cv6l8me,No youre wrong to think that the difficulty in the macro mechanics is about performing the actual task. It really has little or nothing to do with it. It might take less than a second for a pro and  full second for basically everybody else it doesnt matter. Thats not what separates good mechanical players. Its about doing it consistently throughout the game. People dont have extra energy on their queens because it takes an extra half second to do an inject cycle they have extra energy on their queens because theyre not doing it consistently.Because its NOT an arbitrary button. You cant just call something you dont like arbitrary. I enjoy injecting so why is it arbitrary? Why should be say that having to produce units from a rax is arbitrary or remember to get your upgrades when your previous upgrades finish or anything else in the game. Theres nothing arbitrary about macro mechanics.gtInjects are hard for the sake of being hard but if the game will be hard anyway why have them?Because the game wont be AS hard and more importantly it will shift the difficulty away from mechanics and onto microstrategyetc. So whats wrong with that? Whats wrong with it is it disenfranchises people who like macro mechanics. Why is this so complicated?,starcraft,cv6m43m,1,t5_2qpp6

5164127,0,t1_cv8ew00,Suppose both Zerg and Protoss are at max supply.  Suppose that the Zerg has  minerals banked and Protoss has very little banked.  In the current system I imagine that the Zerg would want to slowly trade off supply to get a better engagement and Protoss would want to turtle and get into a longer game.  With the supply change I think that Zerg would just be able to quickly get a  army and overrun the  protoss army.  I think that it would lead to less turtling because the player with more bases and more income could build a larger army to overcome a turtling player with fewer bases and less income.

5232327,0,t1_cvgj8k1,gt I agree though removing manual injects is not the right thing to do. Nerfing larvae from injects or making it a faster stream of larvae over the duration of the inject rather than  larvae popping out at once is a much better way to look at it.Isnt that precisely what happens by removing injects though? Without injects you have to build more macro hatcheries which give you a faster stream of larvae compared to how many hatches you had before and which you have to use quickly since you cant store more than .You have more pressure to be on top of your production and you have to manage the spread of your potentially very numerous hatcheries over the map. Which also give the opponent more places to hit. Thats both more interesting and more strategical for both sides. With the side effect of being much better for players whod rather play the game than mindlessly click every x seconds.One of the main issues is the same with all three macro boosters being able to store them up. Whether its mass mules mass chrono or mass larvae theyre all problematic. And then theres their impact on the pace of the game big irregular speed bumps along the way. Why is there this need to bend over backwards in order to keep these boosters in the game? Fixing terran and protoss without mules and chrono is a numbers game. Fixing zerg without injects... may not even need fixing in relation to the removal of the two others. Theres already everything necessary right here in the game to make zerg macro both harder and more interesting.,starcraft,cvgopsr,-1,t5_2qpp6

Kurt Vonnegut famously wrote a short story about the philosophical problem with trying to level the playing field in order to accommodate some wider audience  namely that it holds back those who thrive under circumstances that the rabble finds difficult.With the above and below posts I made I kinda just wanted to gauge more expert players opinions about how accessible the game is for us normies or whether its accessibility is even important in the first place.

5346921,0,t3_3o8xh7,summary   I was really excited when they announced it but now I am not as hyped as before. I think they did too many compromises and the outcome feels very similar to ladder but with more waiting time.   long version   They did a lot of compromises to keep the waiting time down like    Not have best of     Not have one giant bracked with hundredsthousands of players.  Both would have been more exciting and very different to ladder mind games use of different buildorders against the same opponent blind counters etc. but it would have increased the potential of waiting time.   The fun thing about watching real tournaments is to follow your favourite players or players that you know through the bracket. Since I know nobody in my tournament bracket I dont think it is very interesting to follow the progress of other players. I dont feel any connection to the players in my tournament. There would be no difference between giving me the opponent that is in my tournament or a player from another tournament. If it is not one giant tournament why am I waiting for one specific opponent? If my goal is to keep the waiting time low it would be better to give me the opponent who just finished his game no matter in which tournament he is. It only makes sense to have predetermined opponents if there is only one tournament.If they introduce incentives for the winner that would be nice but I think i would still rather play ladder than play best of ones in a small tournament with waiting time. I just doesnt feel any different than ladder to me.Even if it meant even more waiting time I would have loved to see them do one giant single tournament for each league with best of  instead of lots of best of  tournaments with only  players.,starcraft,cvv4o96,1,t5_2qpp6

5418560,0,t3_3p8r8b,air units in an RTS should be restricted to support positions or be very fragile  important to control individually banshee oracles medevacs are good examples. You can probably list a muta flock there because its practically one mobile mapcontrol exploiting group of units that moves as one and has to be properly controlled. Its also important to note that its a midgame unit and not an ultimate capital ship meaning you have to eventually transition out of it.Massing Tempest Raven Viking BC Carriers just doesnt feel right. It is even more deathbally with emphasis on the ball than any ground unbeatable army just because how it controls.

5420078,0,t1_cw4d8xw,This!Everyone here seems to want to point out that there were heavy damage BW units...... What people are ignoring is that in BW you could have a battle extend as a line across the entire map. That means that you may have spectacular damage done here and there but not onto your entire army.Interestingly this allows for very exciting moments huge AOE happening on multiple fronts without having entire armies wiped out and thus resting the game on a knifes edge where one moment ends the game.But... How to achieve that in the SC engine... Thats the question. Theyve attempted to recreate this dynamic in LOTV by requiring you to spread across the map quickly due to mining out... In theory this would mean multiple fronts... But time will tell... ,starcraft,cw4h0id,12,t5_2qpp6

5473252,0,t1_cwb3tcn,My advice would be to learn a safe build with a timing attack. Practice it against ai to figure out how to manage ur economy have some fun. Play some games with it until u are bored at this point u should be winning games through sheer timing against people your old level you could also be losing but that should tell you how to adjust based on others build ie get spores when u see a starport with the lab then learn a build per matchup.

5506225,0,t1_cweyov0,I dont think its a band aid solution at all. Originally Photon Overcharge was but I think the change is to add more depth.The original Photon Overcharge was very linear and also antiaction and antimicro. What often happens is the opponent moves in Photon Overcharge is cast and then they back out and everyone just waits. Its like a big lets stop fighting spell.With it being on a Pylon it adds another dimension. You can defend the forward Pylon you can use it as a part of cheese and you can still use it for defence. The old Photon Overcharge could only really be used for  of them and occasionally for cheese but to far a lesser extent. Thats what makes it linear.A large push can also shut the Pylon down. That in turn means you should think about where you position your Pylons in regards to Photon Overcharge. That adds depth.Its nice in theory but all the proxy pylons is a bit silly.,starcraft,cwfgz4u,9,t5_2qpp6

5507692,0,t1_cwfmn2s,cannons from the game which were more cool more strategic and needed more skillA static defense structure requires skill? What? At the very least pylon overcharge makes you think about pylon positioning and forces you to keep in mind the whereabouts of your MSC.

Protoss is more about multi pronged harassment while getting up to a big enough base count to where you can do a frontal push to severely cripple or outright win the game.  On the flip side its very possible to engage Protoss in multiple locations to attempt to wear away at his main army and reduce the amount that they can invest into harass.  ,starcraft,cwzlyqq,-2,t5_2qpp6

5680878,0,t1_cx14hlg,I upvoted you because its a mistake I made at first too.GG technically just means you enjoyed the game and thought it went well both sides but up a good fight etc. But it also means game over. Therefore for most people you are telling them that the game over before they were finished trying to win they would have said gg and left if they didnt think somewhere that they might still make it. Think of a chess game where you realize that you won  turns before you do and you say something along the lines of you lose only adding to their growing frustration.  It would seem passive aggressive to them. The primary meaning only a poor attempt to veil the insult. Like the phrase in all due respect. Remember the point of what you are saying.

5690964,0,t1_cx2f4j6,Id like to see something like the followingGM top Master Diamond .Sapphire .Ruby .Emerald .Platinum .Gold .Silver .Bronze .TinCopperWoodwhatever Putting every league at roughly  of the population except the top and bottom feels like it would lead to greater differentiation between leagues. Separating the bottom half and the top half with the metalsgems distinction feels pretty good to me and with this there would be more feeling of progression as you rank up and the rank ups would happen more often giving players more feedback on how well theyre doing. Then with the already proposed numbering system your rank almost corresponds to your percentile ranking on the ladder. A Gold  would be somewhere in the range of the th percentile while a Gold  would be something like the th or st percentile.The league names could be changed to something more intuitive if RubyEmeraldSapphire are too confusing since they dont have an obvious ranking like BronzeSilverGold.,starcraft,cx2iplz,27,t5_2qpp6

5699170,0,t1_cwxnewk,gtThe original Starcraft was a political epic that pitted different races and race factions against each other  it was believable in the SciFi sense of the term meaning it did not violate the suspension of disbelief.For what its worth getting rid of Kerrigan Amon and even Raynor leaves the SC franchise with a clean slate.Zagara as pointed out in her slide at the end claims worlds for the swarm and does not seem to be one that is too concerned with human rights or whatever. So the Zerg may not be the apocalyptic army it seemed to be under the Queen of Blades in WoL but at least it still has the potential of a serious threat.The Dominion now under control of people who are not giant dicks doesnt mean that there is no potential for Terran factions doing shady stuff and starting conflict. I mean unrest within the Terran factions has been a constant in the entirety of SC lore.And the Protoss with the TalDarim not being on Aiur and doing their own thing and having this rather different approach also open the possibility for unrest within the Protoss.So in the end we have unburdened SC from all these divine plotlines i.e. end of the universe etc. and can now come back to the believable gritty scifi plot lines we  or at least I  love.,starcraft,cx3jcg5,4,t5_2qpp6

5701461,0,t3_3t7r92,I do think that scouting is a bit difficult for Zerg to scout or at least early overlords to get into position. But it might be dangerous to just straight up speed buff. One solution I thought of would be to give the overlord an ability called birthing speed. This would give the overlord a speed boost for the first  or so seconds after it hatches  starting overlord counts as just hatched that way if would really only affect the first few overlords. Its slower than a speed overlord. It allows it to be a bit controlled and not make scouting ezpz for Zerg. ,starcraft,cx3tl32,4,t5_2qpp6

5704757,0,t1_cx45p2g,Currently we have to admit zerg has the most ineffective aa outside of PB. Secondly we have to admit that terran has a boss new air unit that lends itself to massing. When looking at an idea such as is pb broken I have to say that Im honestly uncertain.  Until I see it in the hands of a pro Ill never be able to have an intelligent well formed opinion. Furthermore until I see how pros deal with being on the receiving end of it how they react I dont know if the spell is even going to have the impact everyone believes. However you want to discuss it in theory  fine.  if we just look at the numbers  its  over  seconds or about  a second. The only similar spell was irradate which was  which is  or . The benefit of having more damage over more time is that people can micro out of the aoe of the ability. So while youre going to decimate one unit the group as a whole is affected less so. Broodwar was also a much slower game over all. So my tiny bronzeleague brain can generate  hypothetical solutions some more workable than others....The best solution would be ramping the damage up over the seven seconds      Rather than having it tick for  a second. Im aware its a constant drain but that doesnt mean increasing damage per tick gradually  at the milisecond scale isnt possible. This allows the spell to keep its damage effect and makes it more fair to the recipient.....Copying the broodwar model. Making it tick for  over  seconds ot  over . However this creates another drastic consequence. A liberator has  hp. Currently two chain bombs on the same target eliminate one. If we ramp the damage up to  seconds its a guaranteed kill. Im sure they picked  for good reason and  seconds because the game goes at a specific speed. This meathod is a much more intense rebalance....Another last socalled easy fix dont let the aoe stack. Seems like the obvious no brainer. So if there are  units in a cloud and the first two get bombed. The two with bombs are taking  damage but the one without the bomb is only taking . Or you could take it a step further and not have it stack at all but I think that is an over nerf of the spell....Finally and this last idea is awful. Mimic the seeker missle effect. Still make the bomb work the same way but give it a slower travel time to its target so they have an ability to micro out before the dot hits the enemy unit ball. I dont like it because it doesnt have the initial spike damage a seeker misslile does.,starcraft,cx48bfo,2,t5_2qpp6

There are a lot of exceptions that make it hard to understand what an unit does unless you know the numbers. For example why does the hellbat have more health than the hellion something that does not happen with siege tanks? Damage bonuses are random SC had orderly system of the  of bonus damage based on types. Tempest do different damage to ground and air despite the attack looking the same. The liberator has some strange siege mode that shoots ground only and otherwise shoots air only. In addition it cant shoot buildings for no reason.

5736691,0,t3_3tod4p,You shouldnt make fun of a reviewer just because you dont agree with what hes saying. While not the best this is a completely fair review and a fair score as well. Being outraged because he gave the game an  instead of a  because he thought the competitive aspect of the game was too difficult is the most retarded thing you could ever do.Yes the competitive aspect of the game is brutally complex and thats how its supposed to be thats the blood and pride of the game. Thats why people love this game so much.As they should. What you all seem to fail to realize or just simply dismiss because it fits your agenda is the fact that these reviews are never focused on the hardcore demographic of gamers. Reviews in general are mostly made for your every day gamer that wants and likes to play different games instead of sitting down and perfecting a single game. On top of that the reviewers dont have the time to play the competitive part of the game to the point where they understand its intricacies and feel the game for what it really is which would most likely lead them to give the game a higher score.I dont know whether youre all that stupid in here or not capable of your own thought but seriously you all need to sit the fuck down and use your head once in a while instead of tripping yourselves over to be outraged by something thats a normal fucking thing. Its no secret that the competitive side of star craft completely shits on your typical gamer nowadays and thats fine. But the score shouldnt be higher because thats how the game is supposed to be thats not how these fucking things work.TLDR  These reviews are aimed at a casual demographic of players and you should all shut the fuck up being outraged because you spent months or years playing the game and got to feel for what this game really is.,starcraft,cx86y65,2,t5_2qpp6

5767374,0,t1_cxbl7mu,The whole endgame mindset I believe came from the MMO scene where the final boss is locked away in raidtier content and represents the hardest challenge requiring months of gearing upback in the old days in order to even stand a ghost of a chance of challenging him due to attunement mechanics and such.With respect to endgame stuff as it relates to Diablo  Reaper of Souls and more pertinently this game  my understanding is that more missions are coming our way.  Not tomorrow not next week or even next month but surely at some point next year.For the endtier content I fully expect that the highest difficulties will absolutely require your chosen hero to be maxed out in level with all the perks and perhaps some modes would be nigh impossible without the proper hero and unit composition.  Now that to me is the ultimate challenge.  We have to wait and see what they come up with in the near future.Coop missions as they exist today will probably never see Diablo  RoS levels of progression.  I dont feel they were necessarily designed to be that way.  And there are only so many different mission types and to be honest many of them are already going stale.  We would need a good  different mission maps at the very minimum and plus the achievement system to add portraits to reflect if youve beaten all modes on brutalextremeand hopefully soon to come the final boss modes.All that said the brutal modes are tough as they are if you are playing with just a teammate who you were randomly assigned who is level  or less.

5777459,0,t1_cxbw888,Really glad its not just me in that case. My PC was high end..... years ago ew that feels dirty to say. Agreed on that I was watching the Day  daily on how to be a better SCII player and he said his biggest tip is to just focus completely on the minimap the entire time  so you definitely dont need s of colors localized in your small fog of war walled off minimap box!So Im a bit slow for you as far as my speech goes in the beginning? Im horrible at this talking bit especially recording something Ive written I tend to be very robotic so I try not go just completely on script during recording to get a more natural speaking feeling but I guess doing that and improvising certain lines while keeping to a more general point makes me talk a bit slow naturally. Ill try to develop a faster speaking cadence that feels a bit more natural at the same time without so many pauses.Hmm youre right haha I didnt notice how long it literally took from me to get to the review title card to the actual review of the game itself. I kind of rambled for  minutes or so about nonsense. Oh my gosh thats really embarrassing. I just wanted to sound like a normal human being haha! Yeah its all me making units and footage of me playing along with people in the coop I think I threw in one vs. match got embarrassed at how slow I was I havent played competitively in SCII since WoL Im an exdiamond who would probably barely make Silver as it stands right now playing then decided to stop. Blizzard made the footage for Tassadar readily available I think they included it in that cinematic at the beginning of the Legacy of the Void campaign great idea and youre probably right on that one as well.It wasnt super micro intensive so you would have preferred something a bit more intensive and eye catching as opposed to the single force field on the ramp to abuse the Stalker attack ranges?I actually didnt play any of the Arcade I forgot all about it. I have random bits of time from work to play definitely no excuse but after so many times coming back and forth from playing to editing I think I forgot entirely about the arcade as a feature to the multiplayer. Its not something I normally do anyways and I was kind of excited about the coop missions which I felt were a great way for people to make friends.Thank you very much for taking the time to comment on all this I know it was probably a pain to go step by step through the video like this and respond but I very much appreciate it. Ill take all this to heart and hopefully in the next reviewthing I decide to do I can put forth some of these critiques into something positive. Thanks again LonaQQ youre awesome!,starcraft,cxd8y58,1,t5_2qpp6

But if I want to warp in stalkers I just have to select my warp gates hit S and hold shift then hold down Z and tada stalkers. If you dont mind going into the txt file on your computer tho you can make more then  key rapid fire instead.

Or should the Terran just swap some addons so that they have less marauder production less banshee production say they opened banshee and more medivacmarine production? previous tech labs to go on factories maybe.All  players on  team could rush but depending on map size layout and the build order of the  opposing players this may be a build order win or loss a loss or win not due to skill but due to  teams build directly countering another teams build blindly not scouting.In general the team with the overall better mechanics will win spending resources multitasking and also a team that plays together on teamspeak or skype generally does better as they dont have to waste time typing when they could be microing and macroing and can talk and point things out to eachother DTs incoming Ill make Corruptors to deal with the BCs maybe someone else can make something to deal with the mass tanks etc.I dont think there is a single guide for WoL HotS or LotV for v or v I think there are a few videos on v strats as v is limited enough in number of matchups that its possible to come up with strategies.And dont forget passing resources a player can be on  base but afford to produce Carriers off  Stargates if their teammates are for example Terran and Zerg they just go pure marineling but they take their gases and pass all their gas to the Carrier player.,starcraft,cxorhui,1,t5_2qpp6
5867783,0,t3_3vme1p,Its totally worth starting. I started playing multiplayer in this game just a few weeks ago and Im a complete noob when it comes to RTS games. Im very high in silver at the moment which means there is plenty of competition at the low levels if I can win almost half of my games even at this low rank. It can be discouraging to pick up a new game and lose  games in a row until matchmaking puts you in the right league. Thankfully that is not the state of this game right now and youll quickly be put in the league where you belong after your first  or so games competing against people just as new and clueless. ,starcraft,cxospnr,27,t5_2qpp6

5894928,0,t3_3w0j4n,An allin is a build that usually cuts corners on economy to increase its potency. If executed properly its damage should at least equalize you and your opponents economies by its completion. The reason it is allin is because if it fails you will probably be so far behind economically that you may as well gg and leave.It is important to realize that at a certain point any build can be an allin. Some can be way way less effective so the discovery of builds that are strong and that net an outright win or at least an advantage is one of my favorite aspects of sc.

5906883,0,t1_cxtlx61,When talking about Esports I think its more accurate to talk genres rather than specific titles. Do you believe the gamemode Counter Strike will be gone in  years? or MOBAs? or RTS? Sure it might not be CSGO League of Legends Dota or Starcraft  that are the incarnations of the genre in  years and as long as there are graphical or engine improvements to be made videogames need to renew themselves every so often.As a side note they did make a balance change to Football in  when they changed the offside rule so it does happen in regular sports. This is the infancy of esports videogames have never been more popular and we are really only now starting to explore the longevity of esports games. If a title can keep a high userbase and renew itself to stay ahead of competing titles I dont really see a reason why it cant be around for a long time but in either case the genre will live on I think.,starcraft,cxtxbpk,1,t5_2qpp6

If you spread creep towards your opponent you can see their army positioning and when they decide to attack you and if you spread creep around your base perimeters supplemented by overlords in areas where you cannot spread creep such as the very edges of the map you can spot incoming drops.,starcraft,cxvv1f6,1,t5_2qpp6

5941860,0,t1_cxyhu2v,You can just equate minutes to lotv seconds and seconds to blizz time. Theyre scalars. Scalars dont affect percent changes because percents are relative. This is kinda basic math. I can show it to you too.The WoL and HoTS zergling has a base attack speed of .. This is relative to the HoTS blizztime clock. This means it attacks every . blizztime seconds. With adrenal glands this speeds up to . which is  faster than original .. The LoTV zergling has an attack speed of . relative to the in game clock. This means it attacks every . real seconds. This is however the exact same base attack speed as the HoTS version just with the appropriate time scalar between blizztime and real time applied. With adrenal glands this increases to . which is . faster than the original .. Hots increase  Lotv increase. They arent the same. The time scalar is completely irrelevant percentages are percentages regardless of unit of measurement. The buff is more than twice as strong in LoTV as it is in HoTS. As a note blizzard somewhat oddly computes their percentages with regard to the new number rather than the original. This doesnt at all change the outcome of the math when comparing the boosts but does throw off the numerical balues of the percentage numbers you come up with at the end. ,starcraft,cxyiai7,7,t5_2qpp6

5977561,0,t1_cy36fpo,Before they didnt. There was no massive competition. Was being the keyword. Think of the idea of not having every tournament you attend ending stacked with koreans and the possibility of winning for once. Incentive breeds competition. Competition breeds skill. Hopefully this will work out and we wont have to say best foreigner but simply best. Yea thats a bit of a snowball but thats the aim. And ill be straight with you I dont think any of the foreigners will ever claim to be the best. Its not like people cant do a quick google search and call the biggest load of bullshit on that XD. I dont think they are trying to take anything away from anyone. There will still be global unlocked tournies and they still have the  or so major tournaments in Kr. They really are just giving the foreign scene a breeding ground where they can grow and prosper so it wont always be Koreans that are the best. Also that small random tourny doesnt work.

5983911,0,t3_3xeo81,Wow really surprised about the number of considered changes. Despite what has been previously stated about being more proactive with changes than during WoL and HotS I expected them to be much more cautious.Most of the changes sound good. I would have liked to see them test an Ultralisk armor nerf and maybe a Liberator AA nerf as well would be cool to see some more Muta play. I think  damage Photon overcharge will be overkill but it makes sense to buff it a bit to compensate for the doubled energy cost.As for the ladder stuff Id actually personally prefer if we could get back to being demoted whenever as opposed to only during season shifts. Knowing that the ranking will always be the highest you have achieved throughout the season makes it feel artificial and less representative of your actual level of skill. Other than that Im looking forward to tiered leagues. I dont think visible MMR will be as useful and revealing as people expect but still not a bad change.,starcraft,cy40t4q,1,t5_2qpp6

6000704,0,t3_3xn9vn,Ill try my best to make sense of it in my holiday stupor.The Terran magistrate might be looking into a contained room with intergalactic communications devices. These devices use highly radioactive material for transmission. Honestly the Confederate and other Terran are industrial in their implementation of space travel.I think that at this point in time the broodwar Terran are a race thrust into survival mode at all costs. Scrappy engineers and ruthless everymanforhimself cowboys are amuck while pursuing the zerg and protoss for the betterment of themselves over anyone and anything else. A poorly designed meeting room fits this bill I think.Or something...As for the nydus canal all zerg units travel through nydus while on terrestrial planets or space stations. This leads me to believe that the strongest zerg are the ones that last long enough to not only touch creep but also travel through a nydus. Maybe theres some link they share while riding the overmind express. Maybe theres some strange secretion of my mind controlling ooze stronger than creep that helps keep zerg in check.The part about the meeting room for zerg that boggles me is that there are screens attached. Does that mean the cerebrate is a humanoid and needs tvs hijacked by the overmind to communicate with other species or perform intergalactic comms? The protoss one is through crystals. The zerg and Terran one look near identical so maybe the zerg one is a hijacked vessel for communications.,starcraft,cy6814o,1,t5_2qpp6

6005920,0,t3_3xqghh,I dont understand this change. It barely affects adept drops cyclones and marauders are more effective but instead simply removes adepts from Protoss compositions. Mass Marauder becomes a thing again to counter both Adepts AND Stalkers and as mentioned before Zealots dont play nice with Disruptors.The consequences are even more dire in PvP where adepts frequently disappear altogether after the early game.,starcraft,cy6wnlw,23,t5_2qpp6

But then again Im no terran player I only know what Ive seen from GSL and Polt.I have no idea what youre talking about here. My point is that youre complaining about a  unit composition being the best whilst praising an idea that will make mass marauder the best TvP comp by a long way due to it countering every protoss ground unit pretty hard.,starcraft,cy79cis,1,t5_2qpp6

In fact in lower leagues  the more he is microingthe higher his apm probably the worse he is playing. Similarly stutter stepping marines actually isnt any more skilful than a variety of other micro techniques but yields a far greater APM and if done to the exclusion of macro could actually be the reason you are being outplayed by lower apms. ,starcraft,cyhy8og,7,t5_2qpp6

The advise Thorzain would continue to give was just turtle up and get an unbeatable army in TvP and ride it out there was a phase where Protoss had an advantage but after a while it flipped back into Terrans favour.There was this match of ThorZaIN vs Naniwa where Naniwa had  mining bases to ThorZaINs single mining base but Naniwa instead of just killing ThorZaIN allowed him to build his ultimate army and got smashed. Its not a balance poblem per se there is a solution dont let it come that far.

How else do you deal with chat asking you questions about someone all day every day? Destiny should really have just let that go and stopped watching her stream like a fucking idiot.gt does not give you right to calls out someones kidWhat naniwa said was along the lines of think of your child when you use autistic as an insult which is questioning his parenting not calling out or insulting his kid.gtDestiny hates Naniwa and Naniwa hates Destiny but you are always forgetting to add thatNaniwa hates destiny because destiny wont leave him alone.

6173421,0,t3_402y71,I know they will not do it but the main problem with this game is the crappy economy. Units scale too fast with the initial worker base and therefore the meta suffers. It is not a question of adapting it a question of not having sufficient time to adapt.  Furthermore its terrible from a spectators perspective. Literally the observers cannot keep up. In HoTS a lot of the discussion was about he meta because the casters could sit back and watch the builds. Now the observers spend  percent of their time in the center of the map.  gas or  gas... well we dont know.... its like a shitty version of dota. The economic changes to this game have been disastrous in terms of making it a spectator sport. Also it is terrible from a tournament perspective.

6248103,0,t3_415tg6,overall I think there was lots of frustrations and bitterness among korean interviewees today surprising since korean interviews in general tend to be more roundabout in addressing issues.Seed expressed his discontent on Blizzard not listening to their feedback and addressing issues by buffing wrong areas and added that adepts are too strong atm among other issues. BByong literally said he was forced into going bio since mech was unusable. Bit of shame as a mech player since I was expecting some good mech vs zerg games on GSL. He also expressed discontent at TvP state atm stating adepts arent the only problem. Bit of funny remark at end telling protoss players to stop bullshitting. ,starcraft,cyzubgn,1,t5_2qpp6

But if marines have upgrades they counter stalkers and kill alot losing minimal amount. But if stalkers have blink they can counter marines once again if your blinkmicro is good. But if terran has awesome targetfire even with blink upgrade stalkers can do practically nothing.Same with tanks and immortals adepts and marines vipers and air units zerglings and banelings disruptors and ground units etc. It all really depends on the situations you put yourself in.Thats why SC is so complex and beautiful.,starcraft,cz95xbo,1,t5_2qpp6

They have to trade well because their economy is bad compared to the other races. In a perfect world there would be a set of units that were great for a moving for each race but could easily be killed by higher skill ceiling units . Every other game took this into account . Starcraft decided to have units like the ultra and broodlord be very strong with no control so that even high skill players would want to get them . I think they realized this with toss by nerfing the collosus . Not sure why they buffed the ultra when its essentially the same issue as the collusus .,starcraft,czjpxwz,1,t5_2qpp6

Both definitions could certainly apply and I dont believe the sentence would particularly change. The first definition explicitly conveys negativity while the second and original definition as far as I know became so associated with negativity it created the first. While its mostly inconsequential additional definitions seem unnecessary in these situations.The example sentence he received a lot of criticism. shows the ridiculousness of the first definition. Receiving a lot of criticism. implies negativity because one may be less likely to provide advice pertaining to an already strong work piece idea etc. It is difficult to improve upon good and generally easier to understand and convey the faults of a mediocre or subpar thing whatever that thing may be.Its like the oftencomplainedabout recent redefinition of the word literally. The redefinition to mean in effect virtually is unnecessary because the word used in this regard with intentional hyperbole. The meaning of the word has never changed and in fact its use as a nonliteral expression relies on its definition as being exact otherwise the phrase has no potency or comedy.Whats annoying is that the first definition of criticism adds unnecessary redundancy to my post. A mocking criticism. is a judgement or analysis that is intended to be mocking and is therefor an expression of disapproval. Anyways fun observation gg.,starcraft,czjw3nx,1,t5_2qpp6

They are absolutely essential to all Terran matchups.  |gt simply didnt have his priorities straight.Or maybe you just didnt watch the game but want to sound like you know enough about to game to be right in your assumptions which you are not.  What cost the Terran the game was throwing a group of marines into the gold rd base of Zerg to try and snipe it.

To be frank youre a bit out of line to suggest you know what can be easily done. For all we know SC engine code is a nightmare to deal with I doubt this is the case overall but given the nature of bugs in the system I suspect some key modules have some fundamental problems that nothing short of a rewrite would fix unfortunatelyand these fundamental problems manifest as the inconsistent issues that appear in SC client.I dont know if when they say  developers that they mean  native code programmers engine coders but even if that was the case they could be split into various teams such as frontend UI  client backend server  BNet service tools SC editor etc. Regardless its probably safe to say some large subset of all people assigned to SC are working on Nova Covert Ops campaign right now.Edit inserted a missing not,starcraft,czu0v8b,54,t5_2qpp6

Also SH come out too late for a  SH harass to mean much worker kills at the beginning of the game are more impactful  early Oracle than later in the game when Infestation Pit is done.Mutas expensive?

It baffles my mind to see this hatred towards bttv and especially rifkin to grow to this point. Anyone with a grain of common sense and has followed the scene at least for the  years have seen how much bbtv has contributed to the starcraft scene. I noticed them a few years back and thought to myself alright these guys can improve on their casting but damn their production quality is really good...unfortunately Im pretty sure they would move on from the sc community cause obviously pulling in only a couple hundred viewers with such high production value cant last long financially. Fast forward today these guys rack in the most viewership aside from professional productions such as esl and blizzard and sometimes Destiny. Even if you dont know the numbers it was obvious that BTTV financially tanked for so long and quite possibly even now they face financial problems but they stuck with the community simply because they have passion for the game. Instead of crying over how you dislike rifkins casting or some small harmless thing he did how about you guys ask yourself what have you done for this community? Cause quite frankly without bttv we dont really have any other good production streamers that is full time sc in NA. ,starcraft,czx0zrm,2,t5_2qpp6

Thats the amount of production he needs to produce optimally. If you need more just building more after that point defeats the purpose the build is designed to say get  barracks and a starport going  if you eventually need to end up with  barracks and a starport the entire reason for using the build is missed.So really copying pro builds is utterly useless if youre not fairly high GM.,starcraft,czxknvz,0,t5_2qpp6

6562683,0,t3_45hyfb,Been playing Protoss since Wings of Liberty  month per expansion and then I quit. I was under the assumption that I liked the race and while I was winning about   of my matches I didnt particularly enjoy being cheesed. Shortly before LotV got out I began to experiment with Zerg and to my surprise playing this race seemed a lot more intuitive and fun there is something enormously  satisfying about making Drones even though my games became like  hatches and tech to Mutas mostly in Teamgames because thats where it worked best obviously this doesnt work that well in ladder but it did give me somewhat good knowledge about a matchup i had struggled in and now when I hear people complain about PvZ or ZvP exactly the other way around I realize that its easy for neither of them. I then proceeded to play Random which worked well but Zerg just had some sort of magic about it that I had never felt with Protoss I considered switching for a while there but in the end I fell back to Toss because now Im having a go again at becoming good Adepts and stuff help with multitasking efforts a lot. I dont like Terran at all so playing Random didnt make me very happy its not only that I dont know a single BO except for reapers and  rax but also the infrastructure and the way buildings are swapped its something you dont really do in an efficient manner unless youve looked it up or otherwise somebody has taught it to you stream replay coach so Id say if you cant make a decision play random for a while if you arent rushing for a higher league that is get chill with the game basic macro and know the openers lots of work in front of you with this as youll need at least  openers I also suggest that you set your hotkeys up in a way that they are VERY similar to the ones of the other races and enjoy the ride. Once youve played a few dozens of games Im sure youll be able to make a decision there is Random GMs too. I also saw a guy in Plat the other day who had  as Random! and I checked out his games there were no cheesy strats in the games I looked up just perfect execution of different macrooriented builds for each race which is totally cool.

6607140,0,t3_465yxb,Man you had a really good chance to win that game but you made a couple of critical mistakes. . That fight on the cliff at your third  The rocks need to be taken down asap. You should start taking down the rocks with your first couple of zerglings once youve pushed back the reapers as its such an abusable position for the Terran. You also needed to split your army in half and attack the position at the top of the cliff and the bottom at the same time while right clicking all the liberators with your mutas and then focusing the medivacs down that try to escape. You also needed more than  mutas you could have had around  mutas in that fight with about  more banelings with all the gas you had when the fight started. You would have crushed that army.. Once you successfully beat his first push just focus on expanding again spreading creep getting  ultras adrenal glands and most importantly Chitinous Plating. Chitinous Plating is actually the most important upgrade for Ultras as they become almost unstoppable without a disgusting amount of liberators or ghosts. In that counter attack with the  Ultras you only had  armour upgrades plus  base armour for a total of  armour Ultras. Thats why they melted to the marine stutter stepping. If you had  plus  base armour PLUS  Chitinous Plating which gives Ultras an extra  armour for a total of  armour you could have almost won the game outright with  Ultras alone. Unupgraded Ultras are pretty bad tbh but they become immortal tanking gods against marine heavy comps like his with the upgrades.So yeah with a little fine tuning you definitely could have saved the rd hatch and crushed his army and then a few minutes later with fully upgraded ultras and adrenal glands lings with more banelings it would basically be gg for the Terran. Youre definitely improving and I look forward to seeing your progress.,starcraft,d02qfgx,3,t5_2qpp6

Abusive styles are the norm and balancing parrying your opponents bullshit while dealing your own terrible terrible damage is what RTS is all about.Pick whatever is cool gives you satisfaction or is easiest to win with. Watch some proleague and see who you like how they play what excites you. The casters will tell you whats going on what people are trying to do. Then just jump in and play with the same pieces. Just dont expect yourself to figure it out on the first try and expect things to stump you for a while. With time things like builds and stuff will get figured out as you need them. ,starcraft,d02zkw8,1,t5_2qpp6

The reason Zerg usually uses hatchtech units roach or ling even in lategame lineups is because those units are good mineral sinks to include with the more gasheavy units and they benefit from the same upgrades as your highertech units.That said this is also at least partly because of design and not balance.,starcraft,d053frt,3,t5_2qpp6

I know this Ive been to masters so many times in the past few months. If you cant get to masters within the  game limit then your MMR isnt good enough to be promoted.Like a previous person suggested head over to nios.kr click on diamond and thatll list all the diamond players by points disregarding division. A lot of the times promotion off nonMMR will be based off you reaching the rank  spot on overall Diamond then winning a few.I cannot stress this enough rank is not skill. Id put my focus as much as possible on improvement rather than chasing achievements. Once you get derailed over your rank you start experiencing ladder anxiety unwilling to play and resort to a few dirty tricks such as queueing at an odd timezone for players in your region only playing off bonus pool etc the game loses purpose.

Then adjust the research time to the timing of a Starport with reactor.In the early game Bio would also have access to Vikings so I dont really know whats the problem about banshees. Whether Banshees are a starport or a factory unit they still get  shotted by Vikings. Making a Banshee stops Viking and Medivac production which can be painful for Bio. If the Viking is in the factory Bio have more space for banshee production as it only stops Medivac Production giving Bio a reason to go Banshee once they have good Medivac count.The Zerg problem can be fixed with research and Research time. That way Terran has to have the Factory with a Tech Lab for a while and just make Tanks before getting the Vikings or else they can just die to early pushes...,starcraft,d0j699r,1,t5_2qpp6

6772482,0,t3_48h4rm,Starcraft is one of the hardest games in the world to play. Its normal to feel overwhelmed because you have hundreds of things to do. What you have to do is build your mechanics up by building muscle memory. You have to do the fundamental actions thousands of times so you dont have to think about them.As a Zerg Ive injected hatcheries thousands of times its no longer something I think about its automatic.When you make visible improvement its like a drug. The serotonin drip I get when I execute a build order or when I improve is exhilarating. A year in and Im doing things I thought was impossible when I started that keeps me going. With this game you get what you put in. Pro gamers are amazing but thats because they put in  hours a day for years practicing and theory crafting strategies with the best players in the world. If you put in  games a day a couple days a week. You shouldnt expect to be anywhere close to adequate. You need to put in more time exercising moderation of course and you need to work on your fundamentals never getting supply blocked keeping your money low constantly producing from your production.Also dont get caught in the trap of perfectionism. The perfect game of Starcraft is impossible everyone strives for it no one has ever achieved it. You will make mistakes dont be scared to make a move for fear of making the wrong one.

6851160,0,t1_d0sv0yt,I am open to new ideas for Mech. But what people have been talking about are compositions that still prioritize Bio upgrades. The design of Terran segregates Mech and Bio upgrades and all of these Bio Mech comps focus heavily on Bio units and Bio upgrades. On the other hand Ghost Mech against Protoss for example has Bio units but is still Mech centric and Im fine with that. gt Factory lacks amazing AA? Build a Starport the best mech builds from WoL to HotS to LotV involve both the factory and starport. The problem is that this limits your options severely. Of course you need a Starport but the only way to counter for example Brood Lords or Tempests is Vikings and that limits what you can actually do. Shouldnt the Thor be good against those units? gtAlso the idea tankivacs arent mech is confusing to me.Tankivacs only work with smaller numbers of tanks. With Mech you have a lot more Tanks and no Bio units to heal Other than Hellbats I guess so getting Medivacs is usually not worth it. ,starcraft,d0svxo3,1,t5_2qpp6

6872198,0,t1_d0v9gjc,Poker bots  calculate probability for  the unknown. If you do not have all the data available you have to calculate each and every possible state. Doing the same thing for something as complex as starcraft would just be non realistic. It is really similar to having a part of the Go board blackened.So without all the information available you really have to calculate each possibility which brings back your atoms of the universe scenario. Otherwise the AI can only learn what has been implemented prior and would have no spesific response if it encounters something new. In starcraft with the real time element this something new can be changes in a few seconds of which has very high complexity. If you approach this as a turn based game your turns are in milinano seconds which is not sufficent time for probability calculations. At that point  you have to sacrifice consistency which puts them further from their goal To create an AI that consistently beats pro players,starcraft,d0v9xff,1,t5_2qpp6

6883763,0,t1_d0wfxg1,I think youve identified one of the most important challenges that of visual judgement. Its very difficult to ask a computer to recognize visual clues thats part of the reason Go is so hard for AIs. But its the incredibly human way that alphago learns that really sways me. It played millions of games against both people and older versions of itself. Its learned to play like a human learns to play it even plays in a remarkably human way. There are theories that it thinks of all the stones separately not as a connected group like humans do which goes some way to helping us understand how it makes the moves it makes and why. There could be some really groundbreaking or at least interesting innovations if it can get going with starcraft.Im very hopeful I think its certainly doable I reckon its only a year or two away if they can get good players to work with it.,starcraft,d0wla07,2,t5_2qpp6
6883968,0,t1_d0whbhu,Only thing I have to comment on is about Poker. The big difference with Poker and Go which Lee Sedol mentioned as opposed to Starcraft is that a lot of moves are determined by the opponents facial expressions. This is where the computer as a big advantage. It works off of information alone and doesnt take into account emotion. This is something players like Lee and top Poker players are not used to. They are more accustomed to taking advantage of their opponents facial expressions and emotional responses.And in Poker the cards in your hand affect what cards the opponent will have. So the information isnt as hidden as it may seem.,starcraft,d0wm482,1,t5_2qpp6

You can always choose to not play Matchmaking and join a league or find people you can queue with. You cannot ever improve by playing only Matchmaking and Starcraft while you wont have Teammates who hold you back is as punishing as CS is talents like better than average aim wont save your ass here you are constantly clutching v its the same feeling but on a whole new level. Youre gonna lose your first  matches until you have the controls down then youre gonna realize that cheesing doesnt make you a better player then you will try to learn how to macro and expand and in the meantime you will start to struggle because its difficult.One thing Ive noticed though and Ive said time and time again if you play Starcraft for a while and really try your decision making will improve overall and give you a significant confidence boost in CS you will be noticing certain patterns players go for and while your aim will stay the same your senses will somewhat sharpen playing pub CS will be much easier.The fact that youre stating that your teammates is whats holding you back in your very first post just proofs that you are the type who looks for excuses and it isnt anything bad its just a general human mistake almost everybody makes all the time the few who manage to fix that stand out and become decent and I wish you luck with that but youre gonna have to shed that blaming others because in CS its your teammates and in Starcraft its going to be balance race OP tankivacs etc. youre changing one mind prison for another.,starcraft,d0y833g,0,t5_2qpp6

6946055,0,t1_d13lb6g,Blizzards statements that theyve seen balanced winrates across the maps is relatively new news to me.  I never intended to imply that I was reading it as only balanced on the new maps but I can easily see why you thought as much.  My wording was questionable.  My apologies.As far as balance goes in general.  Im willing to acknowledge that my perception of balance may be skewed by watching games on crappy maps and seeing numbers that show an imbalance and also being weak in my PvZ game personally.  This is why when I read that Blizzard is seeing relatively balanced numbers Im willing to back off on my complaints with the matchup.  On top of that Blizzard has admitted that theyre seeing an issue with strategic diversity my original point that we disagreed upon and theyre making moves to fix it.  These two things together have lowered my frustration with the situation.With all of that said I dont think the matchup is PEACHY.  I think the matchup has a long ways to go and I believe that fundamental changes to Protoss early game need to happen so that they can function outside of best case scenario maps.  I dont think Zombie Toss is overpowered and I think that its perfectly fine for Zerg to have to tech switch and move to Tier  units to counter it.,starcraft,d13nzcv,1,t5_2qpp6

6964675,0,t3_4b2nfz,The design flaw with the old Swarm Host was that after Locust upgrades there was never a window of opportunity where you could actually assault the Swarm Host directly since Locusts spawned every  seconds and would last  seconds if fully upgraded. This meant that the Swarm Host could indefinitely stall your opponent and force an indefinite stalemate.Having said this the old Swarm Host was a very fun passive playstyle from the Zerg perspective and there was a lot of satisfaction in locking down max supply armies with as few actions as possible. The new Swarm Host is shit and is not fit for purpose as a harassment or support unit.Id like to see a return to the old Swarm Host except with a slightly lengthened cooldown so that there is actually a several second window where the Swarm Hosts are exposed and have to be backed up.So instead of Locusts spawning every  seconds how about every  seconds? That way you get a  second window of opportunity where no Locusts are active and you can attack into the Swarm Hosts directly and unless backed up by a small army you can chip away at  or  Swarm Hosts. Either that or make the Locust upgrade increase their longevity by  instead of  seconds to at least bring that window of opportunity another way.,starcraft,d15s5av,4,t5_2qpp6

7073631,0,t1_d1hikbu, gt It does look like I got side tracked here. I was never talking about the Korean audience being so racist as to rejectrestrict white people from playing in their professional scene we were talking about the other side of the coin. White people being racist against Koreans. Take in mind that white people do not have the greatest track record when talking about racism.  I said myself that I got side tracked. Calm down.  Kaeldor? A minority of Koreans didnt like him. Okay. Is it not possible that they just didnt like him in particular? Is it not possible that he was being rude to them in the first place? He definitely has no fault in how he was being treated in Korea because social interaction entirely depends on one person right? Its not like it takes two to tango right? Anyways it looks like you are not a fan of reading so I hope you will read this to understand my point. The foreign SC  community dont want to see international events turn into a Korean event despite being an event where the best of the best are supposed to go against each other. For some reason they want to see foreigners qualify in an event they dont deserve to be in. Why? Cant they just accept that their favorite players are simply not good enough? Why do they have to go as far as to limit the amount of Koreans they can have in the event? My opinion on this is because the foreign SC community is racist.  I dont wish for my opinion to be true. I too wish to live in a world without racism. However if we are to accept reality we also have to accept the influence that racism has. Just because people dont want to see Koreans dominating in the top level of play doesnt mean that they should be restricting the Koreans from playing in these events. Thats racist. ,starcraft,d1i5r01,1,t5_2qpp6

But having them as a side story on such a small scale doesnt do them credit.Personally Im hoping that the Defenders of Man are exclusively a Confederate remnant.

When people say most of all strategies they mean most of all the strategies that Ive seen on any of the current mapsGiven that most maps are standard which is course why it is called standard and thus use the same strategies of course most of the strategies you know and are exposed to are going to be viable on those maps.If all maps were completely diferent a greater number of strategies would be known to you and youd be accustomed to and suddenly Overgrowth would have a very limited set of strategies viable in the grand scheme of things as a result.,starcraft,d1qpqhk,2,t5_2qpp6

7189887,0,t1_d1vf8b9,gt Depending on how easily it is deflected it may cause almost the complete removal of the strategy anyway. Increasing defense in early ZvP could also impact aggressive zerg strategies that arent ling drops as well. That completely neglects the fact that what Im asking for is the opportunity to invest in defense.  Not a free defense here button.The option to do a risky strategy is still an option.  The option to invest in defense is still an option.  And just by having the option to invest in defense ... doesnt mean that all aggressive ZvP strategies will disappear.  It just means theres a safer way to reach the midgame and still greedy ways to do so.  Aggression will still work versus the second.Removing hatcherytech Overlords removes all options.gt Adding and removing diversity are two sides of the same coin.Absolutely.  But adding and removing capabilities are not.  The second which is the OL change just removes things.  The first increases the possibilities for one side ... without removing the possibilities for the other even if the risk  reward factor changes.And honestly its only the risk  reward factor that needs to be changed.  OL drops at hatchtech are cool.  They could be used esp on different maps depending to great effect in either of the other matchups even if theyre uncommon today  but not if this change goes through.,starcraft,d1vfgi3,2,t5_2qpp6

7267766,0,t3_4exs5y,I think Blizzard is understanding  the current PvZ a bit wrong. Sure phoenix are great against overlord drops and ravagers but that is not the reason why we make phoenix. Opening blink is fine against either of those.The reason is that unscouted spire will kill us if we dont have phoenix ready. Before PICA became the standard build pros tried to do reactive stargate after scouting spire. You only need to watch some of Solars games to see how that worked out. He made a spire and a hydra den and then either made muta or lurker after seeing what protoss scoutedreacted to. After having to commit to phoenix going immortal is the only choice to combat zerg ground. You cant fight with just gateway units and disruptors take longer to make and arent as effective in low numbers.If Blizzard wants to see nonphoenix openers became anywhere close to standard it would require either making defending mutas without easier or making mutas harder to get.Either one of these solutions would require either changing stalkers or mutas both of which would obviously have severe implications to other match ups. Imo there is no small  or even anywhere near to small change that could make nonphoenix opener viable in anything else than allin or trying to metagame your opponent.,starcraft,d24am54,63,t5_2qpp6

7301686,0,t3_4fcmm4,One thing id like to recommend is a system like in csgo. If you dont play a ranked game in a month? you are removed from the ladder rankings but retain your MMR. All you have to do is play  more match and youre placed back in where you should be. This would help alleviate the ladder shift that he talked about near the end. I would honestly go so far as to say at least a third of the people in higher leagues diamond and masters have  ladder points because they played  game to place then never played again. It probably gets worse in lower leagues. Again i have no real numbers to back that up but just go check your division and see how many people are sitting at the bottom with  win or  loss and little to no ladder points.I realize much of this is irrelevant if the changes jakatak suggests which i wholeheartedly agree with are implemented but blizzard has been known to be a very safe and tentative team when it comes to changing aspects of the game so if they decide not to go drastic this is at least an option.,starcraft,d285hn2,2,t5_2qpp6

Weve been busy testing various things this week and we realized we didnt give you guys a heads up yet. gtThe main gist of it is to have a version of the Swarm Host that is straight up much stronger than right now but make sure that mass Swarm Hosts arent a thing still. We can do a straight up power buff such as a cost reduction in combination with a nerf such as supply cost nerf to prevent mass Swarm Hosts to be too effective in the maxed out army scenarios. gtLets work together on testing the changes quickly because wed like to aim for testinglocking down the specific changes for the actual patch to go live  weeks after that.,starcraft,d29dfz1,1,t5_2qpp6

7313808,0,t3_4fiqib,Just before LotV came out i bought Acer Aspire E.Basicly my modelE is probably  lvl below the one youre looking atE. The only difference is my processor is iM with .GHzFeddback I played the campaign on ultra settings. I had a few framedrops but nothing that made me lower the graphics. I used to play ladder on mediumish settings. I stoped cause of internet issues but i think the laptop itself was handling the game prety well.Also i search in the website  Can you run it is there any games that i wont beable to run on my laptop. It gave my result that GTA V amp the newest Batman are not gonna run on it. Ofc i install GTA V to try it. I had problems only with the highest graphics settings but when i lowered them to medium i had absolutely no problems with GTA V.Also i had been told that with my laptop i wont be able to stream. That may be right. I tryed to stream SC with lowest graphics settings amp i had a lot of lag. Then i tryed to stream Life is Strange amp that went much better. I had no problems with it. Although as i said before my internet is shit so some droped frames happened but i think the laptop handled Life is Strange just fine. IMPORTANT NOTE Still i wouldnt recommend streaming from such laptop. I was advised by ppl who understand these things much beter than me that even if I am able to stream something with my laptop that will just kill it in just a few months. So i havent streamed anything at all after the initial atempt.Hope ive been helpfull,starcraft,d29j3lk,1,t5_2qpp6
7315752,0,t3_4fk28k,Im going to post what I posted on TL.net less than two weeks agogt Heres my suggestion Integrate the PTR public test realm matchmaking and experimental mapmaking together. Call it Uncharted Space. Basically matchmaking would fall into three categories each with their own lore namesgt gt Safe SpaceGreen Zone  Unrankedgtgt Contested SpaceYellow Zone  Rankedgtgt Uncharted SpaceRed Zone  PTR all the crazy maps and balance changes that David Kim wants to test with the benefit of matchmaking to find willing Guinea Pigs.gt gt Unranked and Ranked would work the same way as it does now. A combination of old and proven maps and new and experimental maps.gt gt The PTR would now have its own matchmaking queue with the warning that the commanderexecutorbroodmother is entering uncharted space with unpredictable results blah blah blah. The point is that the PTRUncharted SpaceRed Zone queue would be updated far more regularly than normal queue and would have more nonstandard maps and other crazy balance changes that can be tested by a large number of players.gt gt Abandon all MMR all ye who enter.gt gt You could reward them something similar to the tournament portraits of Warcraft . IIRC you got portraits for tournament wins separate from race wins and random wins in WC. In SC youd get portraits for venturing forth into dangerous territory in the name of ValerianArtanisZagara.gt gt The current system of voluntary balance testing just isnt working. Theres no reward for participating in the balance maps and theres not enough people who are even aware of them let alone how to play on them with people at their level.

7337431,0,t3_4fts99,I completely agree implementing changes is going waaaay too slow. Theres so many problems at the moment to the point where I would like to see Blizzard just TRY stuff instead of keep testing small changes for months before something actually happens.I think the most important thing that Blizzard has gotten completely wrong is the units. LotV is so much faster paced and has the potential to create such intense games with amazing engagements. The economy is designed for players to get units faster so the action gets going quicker. The early game is interesting as this is where most timings hit and both players usually try to harass eachother. This setup for an amazing midlategame is however completely ruined in my opinion by siege units. Units like lurkers liberators now also swarmhosts and to some extend tankivacs really dulls down the gameplay. Midgame pretty much skipped in LotV aswell as people tend to get relatively early tempests and broodlords. In my personal opinion theres nothing fun in watching players being sieged by a single kind of unit and being forced to take Amove engagements. It wasnt fun in HotS it isnt fun now. I get that its a strategy game and its supposed to be like Ooooh amazing build and armycomposition he knew just how to make the lurkers and swarmhosts right! but things like disruptor fights even tho it might seem stupid at times makes for some sick highlights and intense moments. One moment everything seems okay the next a player loses  vital units to  shot. Or with widowmine hits against lingbling. These are the moments that make for great highlights and hype situations. Not siegeunits. We see it in CSGO for example. People like spontaneous moments wallbangs double kills aces etc more than Ts planting the bomb flashingsmoking the CT away CT saves weapons. That shit is not nearly as hyped.Sorry for the rant but Im pretty tilted atm. Just threw my thoughts down on the keyboard.TLDR Agree faster and more bold changes. I think siegeunits are killing SC  People say Hey did you see Harstems disruptor hits against puCK yesterday?? That was sooo sick! not Hey did you see Snute sieging the shit out of Zest for  minutes yesterday?? That was sooo sick! Just used random players.,starcraft,d2c7rny,-1,t5_2qpp6

But its not as simple as type a few lines to fix a bug as you naive children of Reddit seem to believe. We do get a lot of bug fixes on the regular some bugs never get fixed because they cannot find the cause. Even though I said If you cant replicate a bug you cant fix it doesnt mean if you can replicate a bug you can fix it. Just because you can replicate it doesnt mean you can find out why its happening. That bug I cant think of a reason for why its happening and evidently neither can Blizzard since it hasnt gotten fixed.

7381703,0,t3_4gg3kl,Glad to see feedback from people who actually played on the test map rather than just talk without testing. From my own experience playing random  . I agree I like the new Thor AA.  . As Terran I loved the new Banshees already but this made them viable early game rather than just mid or late game. I didnt really see them much as Protoss and as Zerg I agree they can be crippling. I wouldnt call them bad yet since I only played a few ZvT and maybe with time it wont be an issue.  . While I think only one nerf is needed Id prefer the AA nerf over radius I think both is managable but makes everything much harder since Libs are key unit in every build right now.  . I personally like the change it brings it in line with how other races respond to Mutas while also adding a bit defense against other early game units. I found FFE was pretty strong actually in all three matchups. I actually saw no downside since Mutas still worked but you couldnt succeed with just  mutas against  cannon you needed to actually think ahead with mutas which I liked both as Protoss and Zerg.  . I tested these a lot with some of the ideas CatZ introduced and found them to be better when used creatively. I used  within my late game HydraLurker comp against Ultras to very good effect and the lower cost actually mattered. They are still strong against Protoss in harass with with the lower cost I didnt feel like they were a big investment in the mid game the was obviously going late game. I found the raised supply hurt much more late game when each supply counts the most and they still suck against Terran with Marines Thors and Libs. I do think more creativity by players will help the SH more than other changes but I think going back to  supply with the current cost would be the best way to go.

Well raptor strain would be amazingly powerful so you have to make it lategame but thats when Lings falloff in power thus Adrenal glands too give them just some lategame power. I think in most the comments the power of Raptors is being a little overestimated. Raptors gained  dmg over normal lings Adrenal gives bonus attack speed. I would merge the raptor upgrade to have both these but tone down the attack speed.The end result would be a cancer unit in the lategame that could rat your base out from under you . I think this could be a thing in a fictional version of starcraft lings are squishy they die really easily the power of this ling would be ratting bases and it wouldnt be good for the game.,starcraft,d2kequf,1,t5_2qpp6

Tennis simply does not attract the same amount of eyes.And yet tennis is in no danger of dying as a sport. Not even close. The top athletes are still rich with sponsorship deals and become household names.Starcraft  was the top esport when it was still new. Hell it even gave birth to Twitch but that is all because of the esport climate at the time which was rather lacking in the West. Starcraft doesnt need to be the number  esport for me to be happy with it. Im happy with it as long as I can still watch tournaments and high level play.

7426626,0,t1_d2m555u,for real people latch on to the skill issue  thats not what drives people in or out.  in  starcraft  was one of the hottest topics in gaming with articles and attention from gaming media like IGN and gamespot and many content creators were proud to broadcast their silver league adventures just to be part of the craze.  thousands of people had fun cheesing each other and being collectively bad in bronze league and the game was cool.  i mean people each had  supply at  minutes and didnt realize how bad they were but still played.  the game just got unpopular to follow because it wasnt cool anymore and its probably cuz other stuff got cooler and the game couldnt catch upa more recent example  lots of people were convinced archon mode would revive the game because that would be a crutch for hard skill floor and people playing better would enjoy the game more.  RIGHT???  well the problem is at least in my anecdotal case my friends would rather be independently bad or just ok with their own armies while playing with a friend than be good or perfect together with one army.  why? because being perfect is boring and its practically the same mode as v which people dont like anyway.being hard to play does not make something not fun being not fun makes it not fun.  this often gets lost in the discussion from aspiring prostars who forget there is a whole subset of people playing not to be the next foreigner hope,starcraft,d2mcyex,3,t5_2qpp6

7634533,0,t1_d39gf4j,Well in some ways yes trying to solve starcraft using a search tree would be completely impossible there are thousands of possible moves each second youd have to search through even searching say  seconds ahead is INSANE. Maybe if you abstract the game a ton you could use limited treesearch for macro purposes but I agree that it seems very difficult to do so.However while SCII is a lot more complex than go it is also a hell of a lot easier for computers to understand. Most decisions in starcraft can be made using maths and datarendering searchtrees and such unneccesary. You can use formulae and lists of builds etc. to determine the optimal thing to spend your money on. You can abstract the game as a series of graphs covering armyvalue economytech etc.Applying deeplearning to that would be quite easy though perhaps not even neccesary as you could simply use already known functions instead.  Manipulating maths formulas and comparing to known builds etc. is incredibly easy for a computer while understanding abstract patterns in go is extremely difficult.Add to that a very sophisticated microAI like the one on display here with the added challenge of limiting APM to say  and determining how to efficiently use those  moves per minute is also a very easy task for a computer you should be able to simply calculate which moves are the most important using once again maths  not search trees and you have an AI which should be easily capable of competing at the highest level.Not saying coding this AI wouldnt be a great challenge but Id guess it would be significantly easier than go was.,starcraft,d3a061f,1,t5_2qpp6

Terran has been balanced around this unit an airtoground nerf would be akin to the infestor treatment and there appear to be no corresponding Terran buffs. So uh whats the plan for Terran there? Never allow the game to get past  minutes?Edit I fully understand that this is just kespas feedback but how does kespa suggest this with a straight face? Zerg would overpower Terran without it and Protoss no longer needs AoE to defeat a groundbased Terran army. The liberator is vital against Protoss in the midgame.

7742330,0,t3_4lc1sq,I actually really do like TvT in LotV when it doesnt end by a blind counter in early game. I really like the fast paced keep engaging type of gameplay. And the new TvT is very very explosive and very versatile. One big mistake can cost you the game without removing all of the strategic aspects. I actually feel like there still is a lot of strategy with the Tankivacs its just in a very different.Overall i really like the new fast paced gameplay and i really feel like its almost always the better player that wins whenever it goes to midgame. The negative side is that it has really become a cheesefest meta kinda like the gas first period. ,starcraft,d3m8w5o,1,t5_2qpp6
7743524,0,t1_d3md17h,Thats fine but at your level its a subconscious thing that you dont really need to think about. Your mind is on unit comp what the opponent is up to and how you can deal damage to them. Masters players are the top  or so of players in the entire world. Diamond is about  I think.You need to understand that the other  and I think Im being generously low on that of player population are struggling just to make buildings on time. We dont have the spare apm to micro manage our bases and count the workers were flat out just trying to make units and not put them in a place where they are going to be annihilated by two well played banes or widow mines.At the moment i cant even remember to BUILD workers never mind getting them to a specific number and then evenly spread them across all bases at the same time constantly making army placing new buildings on time scouting the enemy understanding the enemies actions microing my army placing expansions defending those expansions harassing the enemy building the RIGHT unit comp  its extremely overwhelming. A game should never be difficult due to complexity of the interface thats artificial game difficulty and its frustrating to new players like myself. Its not a game breaking change it just tells you what you already know but faster  which is unbelievably important in a game like sc. Its a quality of life change and if you want to be technical it makes sense to show. For a low level zerg I could imagine this being invaluable to gauge your position in the game and help prevent over droning without having manually add up your worker count. This is not a change that gives you new information it only displays what you already know just more conveniently. Its a quality of life change that helps lower the stupidly high barrier of entry to the game. It doesnt suddenly make the game easy to play there is still a ridiculous amount of complexity left without having to fight the ui for basic information.,starcraft,d3mds0w,3,t5_2qpp6

I agree with him and a majority of people in SC that are smart do as well.Been complaining about this shit forever now but blizzard wont change it because they think its exciting to watch.It may be exciting to watch but its frustrating as fuck to play.An invincible nydus worm spawning in my base that i can see and not do anything about is incredibly fucking frustrating and stupid as hell to play against and this is coming from me as a GM player and other GMpros feel the same.Invincible adept shades warp prism  range pickup tankivac  armor ultra liberator behind mineral line mass reaper early game...theres a ton of stupid shit blizzard put in LOTV that hasnt been tweaked or fixed and is stupid to play against.The amount of autolosses via build order and terrible gameplay mechanics in LOTV is much higher than it was in HOTS.  Your friend isnt wrong to be incredibly annoyed  frustrated by that shit because it frustrates even people that have played the game over a decade.  But you should get him to play again the game in general is still fun As a Terran player i honestly thought blizzard should not have nerfed the liberators damage in any way.  They should have just removed the liberator range upgrade from the game so its not so abusive vs every race and even in the mirror matchup where it out ranges every unit in the game lol.,starcraft,d3n73nx,0,t5_2qpp6

Almost every standard Terran build is not focused on defending and building econtech. They focus on harass with tech units and big powerful mobile midgame bio armies.    When people say zerg is unbeatable lategame they forget to mention that this is only after Terran fails with their midgame focused strategy. Zerg kills a bio army in the midgame and suddenly they are ahead in econ armysize and tech.

7765267,0,t3_4lmwbj,Siege tanks are pretty much the answer for canon rush. Build a factory as far away from the canons as posibble and then have the factory make a tech lab. I usually lift off and build the addon by my minerals. One tank usually does it for me but if you think you need more Id say have no more than three out at any given time as long as the canon rush lasts that is. You might need to defend you tank if he tries to melee with a probe or zealot. If this happens get a couple SCVs to defend the tank and one or two to repair it. When your tank is out the canon rush will eventually fail. Keep in mind that a canon rush is very costly and when youve succesfully defended your self hell have almost nothing.Edit when all is said and donedid I use that phrase correctly? just lift off your factory and repurpose the tech lab with a barracks. Your opponent will likely try to take down your barracks. Keep it alive long enough for you to get your tank out. If hes distracted with the barracks he probably wont care about your factory.Typed from my phone I apologize for any spelling grammar or format errors I mightve missed.

Yeah amazing storyline.gt a consistent classificationXXX is the best zerg  terran  protoss in the world was always the go to blabla if someone pulled out a great performance.gt doesnt promote competitionIn fact it promotes a competition where everyone is around the same level. The old system did not do that. At all.And last but not least The old system was not a sustainable solution for the foreign scene. It wouldve died off within a year or two or three if things continued to go that way. It is sad for koreans that were able to travel yes. But people always forget that IEM Dreamhack etc. are foreign events with foreign sponsors. Are you really thinking thered be even a single SC IEM or DH without foreign players?!Yes it would be cool to see a few! korean v foreign matches other than the dozen or so online cups that show us these kind of matches pretty often but its obviously not feasable at the moment.

7766483,0,t3_4loqce,Arcade requires searching or prior information Coop requires you pick a hero and play.Many people Like objective based vs AI and many arcade maps are PvP player v player not protoss v protoss with strange rules not everyone wants strange rules or PvP. Also cooperative gt competitive in terms of number of people willing to play these days and while there are coop arcade maps see point .Its also a bit of a self fullfiling thing. People try arcade search for a bit and find something cool. No one playing it so they try again with another map takes forever to find a game. So they decide no one plays arcade and therefore there is now  less person to play arcade meaning its more likely the next guy comes along and believes no one plays arcade.Also while the best arcade maps do tend to give a brief crash course on how to play many dont which makes them unfriendly to new players and the issue is many of the players who consistently play a single map in arcade get pretty damn elitist and BM when other players dont play perfectly cause it ruins their game or some shit. All combines to make it pretty hard to learn what youre meant to do and the issue is many of those elitist players dont want you to play well they basically dont leave you alone till you play perfect in their eyes. Take ladder BM and now imagine a ladder where you wherent placed against someone of similar skill so when they say you suck theyre right assholes but right and what motivation do you have to get better when its to play with dicks like him what resources can you google to get better when even the creator didnt put a guide in who can you ask for help when the other dudes are the ones saying you suck.

Since high queue time will deter players from playing the game specially new players. Of course i didnt mention previously that the average game duration does factor into how reasonable queue times are. But yeah if it takes  mins to find a good game regardless of its playerbase it becomes a major detractor to playing the game. your other example once again if there are only  players you will not have consistent low queue times and good matchmaking.

How is keeping players from facing cheeses until they play against better players going to solve anything? Not only are they going to have no idea how to play against them but also have to go against players who practice and for the most part properly execute them. It will only make cheeses more frustrating for new players because theyll be so much worse versus them once they finally do face them.gtAnd maps doesnt teach how to play SC so that argument is just wrong.

7920668,0,t1_d46cemk,The visa itself is a loophole. These rules were formed with the intent of keeping Koreans OUT. If you think thats not the case look at the history of restrictions. Simply put Blizzard underestimated Koreans with each WCS iteration. Each year they realized they fucked up and each year they made restrictions for Korean participation tighter.History repeats itself. Blizzard underestimated them they thought applying for a visa wasnt a realistic option for Koreans. When it was only viOlet that was still okay. Now theres four soon to be five.Honestly I wish people at psistorm envyus and root all the misfortune in the world for abusing this system but ultimately its Blizzard that I need to blame.

7993989,0,t1_d4ekt1d,Well they dont need to be  Supply could be . I mean u are right it would be to many but they wouldnt be as powerfull as now.  Hydralisk now deals  damage per shot and has very fast attack speed. But with my Idea they only would have . So One Hydra needs like  shots to kill  Marine Zergling and much more for killing a ZealotAdept.Changing its  attack every . second to  every . is a really small upgrade.Only  health on a  unit is way too low it means that any kind of AoE will decimate those expensive units in no time.  supply makes this only worse.with its DPS cost and health the Hydralisk is not even a glass cannon it is just glass.  Marines dont cost gas have more HP between them can be healed are faster have almost same range and deal almost twice as much damage.So i think my Idea isnt that bad.  Health would be ok for such a unit. It would be like a Roach with an AA attack and FINALLY faster as a Worker.,starcraft,d4elmep,1,t5_2qpp6

8002328,1,t3_4ot2d4,I really dislike the way game have gone at least for a viewer. Its the same monotony of biolib PICA roach ravager in the match ups and the game is extremely slow on any forseeable changes that would change this. At least in hots you had ling bing muta vs m monotony that provided better form of action. Maybe even odd mech thrown in. Now you have nurtured lbm vs terran all in before hive or boring boring roach ravager.Tvz is a mess and poor game to watch. Without any reliable anti ait zergs just wait in their base trying to endlessly defend terrain bio drops after bio drops while roach ravage clumsily waddle between bases slowly  what can they do? Muta cant do much due to liberator marine so drops reign the match up and ling bane isnt really good because of  larva beibg so inefficient early game. All zeros do is survive to hive or all in while terrans only option is bio drop to hyper drops before hive to end it. Its not really enjoyable match up to watch or play on both sides. Match up revolves around getting to hive and I think blizzard should rebalance matchup so its more even at all times. Right now its terran favored at mid then zerg at late with matchup purely hanging over hive.Tvt is a mess to watch in my opinions. Takivacs are flat out boring to watch after the initial rush of excitement when it was introduced. Tvt used to be very varied mirror but it just feels chore to watch now with strong early game counters than before leading to same old Takivacs marine that drops tanks bypassing all position advantage,starcraft,d4fjcur,0,t5_2qpp6

Sometimes if I havent been playing that much the same. But if Im laddering and playing constantly DT is always on my mind when I go up against Protoss. So never causes any major problem.As for the other games Hamster was taking early macro advantage constantly. And in midgame it seems Scarlett was playing way too offensively. Like not really turtlling enough. Such as lack of spines in position to protect her bases. Like in Dusk Towers it looked like the spines came down later.I also dont really get some players using one spore against alot of Phoenix and lose so many peasant rather than just get a next spore.Congrats to Hamster. He did really well. He also won in China against a similar lineup of players with other Chinese players.,starcraft,d4pyl1t,1,t5_2qpp6

8125587,0,t1_d4scnfh,gt This is only true for LBM. RR and ultracorruptor is not larva starved nor are they cheap disposable.Nor does it appear to be able to win games.gtThere is also issues with scaling. Its much easier to give a higher percentage with small numbers like larva count. By your method an increase of larva count by  the smallest incremental would mean a huge percentage change.The goal here is to increase it marginally.  The problem with queens is exactly that.  Zerg production lacks granularity.   Extra larvainject is the equvalent of  a production facility and would be an extremely powerful buff.  Thats why I didnt recommend it.  I recommended increasing the hatchery larva spawn rate from  seconds to .  Apparently this might be too strong but I think that is actually because of an interaction between spawn larva and natural larva production that is causing resulting in an issue where instead of  larva in  seconds zerg is getting  larva.  The change to  seconds actually results in a  larvaminute buff when the theoretical change should only be a . larvaminute buff.,starcraft,d4te0pt,0,t5_2qpp6

8128881,0,t3_4qi5kp,Hey always good to hear that someone dares to push the ladder with no experience gj     A few things to add to that  Unrankedranked is exactly the same the only difference is you will not get or lose ladder points while doing unranked. And even if it werent peoples skill levels would still be there.    Also Its a competitive pvp which mean people will try to do potent stuff against you there is no builtin rule to protect your back. You just need to learn about some strong openers like you mentioned and try something out that is safe against most things or that can counter attack faster then them.  In competitive PvP you always need to adapt to what your opponents are doing to some degree or need to use a somewhat solid build If anything there shold be a few guides against the most common cheeses.  Once you can fight a little bit of room for yourself you will be able to do pretty much whatever you want.      The ladder is not just a place for Korea worshipping tryhards. But its a bit more intense than an idler game.      GL HF hope you will get thorough the first hard steps.PS. General advice  Bunkersmarines and pull SCVs against early attacks.Turret in each mineral line maybe even a viking against air harass.Try to have less than  minerals without queing production in the first  mins. against optimized stuff.

8195831,0,t3_4rknue,Lets get real here for a second.Apotheosis is too damn long and will create constant boring macro games.  It takes players for fucking ever to move from north side to south side.  Its extremely hard to do any type of aggression especially terran since parading up the map literally takes  seconds but one snipe on the warp prism and protoss are fucked too.  It isnt that friendly for zerg either because unless you have a ton of creep itll take them forever to reinforce unless its just speedlings or mutas hah! and there are so many chokes that even the bigger units wont be great.  Dasan  Did any of the games even get watched?  It was a garbage map from the start and will produce nothing but cheese and gimmicky games.  Instant Veto after  at most  game from the majority of players.Galactic Process  Since they are already reusing Frost amp KSS why not just bring back Cloud Kingdom instead of this map?  The only changes it does is adding a shitty backdoor that was never used in the BTTV tournament makes it a much more vulernable natural but rocks block off  of the  paths! Yeah doesnt matter.  It basically the same exact pathing except a few spots are wider.  Garbage rip off map.  Just bring back Blink Kingdom especially considering Blink stalkers arent in a good position right now.Gettysberg  The changes they did to this map make it better and opens it up more.  One of the better maps in the pool.As for the maps remaining in the pool?  Why the hell keep Frost amp KSS?  There were a ton of other TLMC finalists as well as tons of other good maps that would be better used.  There you got your short season to try out these old maps now lets try some new shit already.  Hence why I said bring Cloud Kingdom back instead of Galactic to try it out for the season then lets get rid of that too.  So many good maps out there and we get to use old shit.We know youre trying Blizzard youre doing a hell of a lot better.

To explore this notion in greater details weve pinged Kespa to get the stance of all the top players in KR to gauge the prostance as a whole. We have no actions planned yet but we wanted to let you know so that we can all watch together to see if the situation actually is bad and to discuss further moves together if they prove necessary. gtgtThe leading suggestion to test on this front so far is bringing the spawn larva count up from  to . We believe that this could be a good change if Zerg is really weak against Terran and because we know that Protoss could very easily still be slightly ahead of Zerg in ZvP it could be a good change there as well.PLEASE link where it said kespa reccommended the change and not specific Korean pro players that could be literally anyone. ,starcraft,d52thda,1,t5_2qpp6

This probably has a lot to do with the fact that both races have so few options.  Theoretically if both races had more unit diversity almost any imba strat could be balanced out by the metagame and wed just watch the balance swing back and forth without Blizzard changing anything.  But terran has to make bio because mech is too slow and expensive for LotV and similarly Zerg is limited to roachrav because they dont have the larva for mutalingbane and hydralurker is awful against terran because hydras melt against terran dps and lurkers are not effective vs terran because of scan and all the range of terran.,starcraft,d584v2s,7,t5_2qpp6

As hard of a pill it is to swallow ga by sponsoring all these streamers tournaments etc is bringing a lot of money to the sc scene. Only real way to get rid of ga would be to find other sponsors not turning off adblock.Also if streamerstournaments are sponsored by ga but no one in the their audience actually buys anything from ga then no harm has been done.

He might be planning something to transition the Dominion from an aristocracy to a more democratic government.Unfortunately Davis and her minions threw a spanner in the works complicating things. It could even be that Davis doesnt want Valerian to bring democracy to the Dominion. Her being loyal to the Mengsk family specifically Arcturus might mean that she finds freedom to be detrimental to the Terran race.What better way to get the government to restrict freedom than an outside threat? It worked after  it worked after Pearl Harbor etc. Thats where the psi emitters come in. They draw in the Zerg to ravage Terran worlds.And just to make sure the DoM attacked the TalDarim and drew them back to Terran space to ensure an even bigger clusterfuck.Two alien races attacking humanity once again.

8724740,0,t1_d6vtp3x,Thats the way you can create your control groups. If you just create one the units also stay in the groups they were previously in. That is good for binding widowmines or for example medivacs in your main army. But if you need to quickly split up units  for drop for runby for defence  its better to use CreateSteal function it can be bound to Shift or Alt for example. If you are dealing with harassment at home or just adding units to your main army its better to use AddSteal function same can be bound to CtrlShift or Alt so the units will be removed from all the other control groups without needing to deselect them.You can see on streams like all top terrans are struggling with deselecting their units especially if they F. They hover over each individual unit with their mouse and click on each and every one of them and then rebind their control group without those units attached  just to send them to drop or to scout on the map. This can be easily avoided by using CreateSteal or AddSteal. One click and done.Unfortunately most SC player dont know much about mechanics of the game so they dont use the tools that are avaliable. I for example very much respect Xenosider and he is now firmly in top NA GM but he didnt even know he could press the Return Cargo hotkey on SCV to make it go back to the CC and then automatically to the mineral patch it came from.Honestly as Zerg you should be the race that knows best about this stuff.,starcraft,d6w8g14,1,t5_2qpp6

8737652,0,t1_d6xumtt,Im not confused about anything mate. The harass youre talking about did not determine the result of the game it was already effectively over and TY was doing harass long before he scouted the fourth. Scouting or not scouting the fourth would have made no impact on the game. Dear took it because he knew it would be safe in the first place. Youre pretending Dear held an economic advantage when that wasnt the case and TY held a tech and upgrade advantage and still couldnt press forward across the map to end the game.

8881328,0,t1_d7f7e9s,I think total annihilation was a fantastic game that really nailed physicsbased large scale RTS.  It was way ahead of its time and it  still impresses me today. Yes it sacrificed precise micromanagement for slowerpaced overall strategy but I just feel Blizzard has the capability of defining a new kind of RTS that marries elements of both sides.  Lets not be so defeatist.  I actually think Supreme Commander  already achieved great strides in streamlining gameplay while maintaining its sense of scale.  IMO the main issues with the Supreme Commander series are storytelling and developer commitment to competitive play. And these are precisely the two components Blizzard excels at.

Over the years the community has gotten so much better. Ive seen silver players with  APM that play their heart out and they cant move up because there are just too many solid players above them. It almost seems like all the higher rank players have stayed and the gold and below were the first to leave the game.In the ladder you play vs other people and usually your goal is to get better  depends how seriously you try. Of course over longer time periods this leads to overall increase of skill happens in pretty much anything.gtOne last thing that might be a problem with new players is starting off with  workers. I know I like it this way but for someone learning to play the game it creates a situation where people are struggling to spend minerals and getting destroyed by early game pressurecheese.Your income per minute on same worker count hasnt changed during sc. Sure you might get start with  workers now while in hots you had  workers after one minute. It only changes how fast you start to fail pretty fast in either case if you cant handle  workers.I dont see how the economy has any relevance to cheese play being very strong in lower leagues  as such bad execution of cheese doesnt really rely on game balancedesign but rather to their opponents inability to react there are multiple reasons for this.gtThis game is very unforgiving and not very noob friendly. For the first part That is the beauty of the game.For the second part Imo sc is a lot simpler than most rts games to get into simple tech tree simple spellsabilties simple economy simple armordamage system etc. Of course getting into rts genre in general can require you to learn a certain mindset.,starcraft,d7jg1xe,1,t5_2qpp6

8990422,0,t3_53cgtb,You can one base a zerg that is greedy and not paying attention and get an easy win with a combo of hellioncyclones.  But if they catch wind of it theyll make more zerglings creep and queens.Cyclones annhilate ccnexushatch quickly even if you only have  of them.  Combine cyclones with hellions and you can have a mobile strike force that is hard to engage.Try  fac like avilo vs protoss or zerg but before getting to making tanks with the damage buff start out with some hellioncyclone and you can be annoying.Interesting enough and counterintuitively one basing against a terran is tougher since you cant just marinehellionlibtank them since you cant fight outside your base if they have the more powerful composition of having some cyclones.A hellioncyclone pack make the perfect harassment run by group because the cyclones can kill stuff the hellions would just tickle.  If youre out numbered just run away.   I always used to park my unused hellions just outside their base hidden in the fog of war.  And when roaches came Id run by and fry drones.   Now you can pop the hatch and get reinforcements too.   The fact that you have speed vs zerg and protoss means a bad engagement that you can get away.  Cyclones wreck stalkers and do pretty okay vs non upgraded adepts.And a final tip send a repair scv or two.

The foreign scene is a bunch of pros living in different parts of the world. A large majority of the money spent by teams is spent on travel and hotels. The pro player population density in Korea makes it so that players actually get salaries. Only in Korea is it possible for long form weekly tournaments like GSLSSLProleague to exist because it is financially feasible for players to travel to the studio and play live. Without the Korean scene we will be left only with these once a month tournaments where teams and sponsors spend thousands of dollars on flights and hotels events where players with lucky brackets make money and players with an unlucky bracket dont even have a salary they can rely on.

9112818,0,t1_d876sa7,gt The WCS regions are supposed to stop koreans from taking WCS points from foreigns tournaments without contributing to the regional scene by playing on the ladder and living there.No iNcontrol has already debunked this myth publically. The WCS system as it is today happened because of several things but the primary one was that tournament organizers such as Dreamhack and ESL demanded it from Blizzard. Its got nothing to do with WCS points being taken away from foreigners but rather the game having such bad viewership at weekend events and WCS being an unprofitable venture for ESL to continue to produce it that they had to change something.Maybe the thought of Koreans coming over and being forced to contribute sounds nice and all probably doesnt to them! in practice whats happening is that players still regularly fly to South Korea before any major tournament and have not been fulfilling their Ladder quotas under the conditions stated in the rules. HydrA outright admitted he doesnt play  games on NA each month. Blizzard has probably only now given him a warning for a firsttime offense not that well learn about it anyway when this offense has been going on for  months already.gt Thats why they even made the ForGG rule for a player who did just that.No they made the ForGG rule because Blizzard felt sorry for his situation.

To Vorazun the scenario probably seemed callous or lazy of Zeratul just accepting that the Queen of Blades was telling the truth about Raszagal being completely under her control and totally beyond being saved. Without consulting anyone he killed her mother and then just disappeared afterward with no explanation.Another point is that Zeratul caught the rap for the Overmind finding Aiur even though he couldnt have known that killing a Cerebrate would have that result. Tassadar is really just as responsible but he got a pass for doing a heroic sacrifice. So when Vorazun spent the last few years damning Zeratul she probably had very few Protoss telling her she was wrong to think of him as a traitor.Finally Zeratul pretty much vanished from Protoss society in general without explanation so he wasnt around to present his perspective or defend himself and almost no one knew what he was doing or why he disappeared. ,starcraft,d8a3c4z,2,t5_2qpp6

It enables the game to be more accessible for newer more casual players and allows more advanced players to focus their apm on more exciting tasks. Adding useless actions goes against Blizzards main goals for starcraft avoiding apm that doesnt contribute to the games excitement when playing or viewing. Although Im really glad Blizzard decided to make this information available I think they really ought to take it one step further and make it always visible.

At a time when zergs are really struggling at the top level no sorry the foreign scene is not the top level and I do lament that fact you cast purely from the viewpoint of the terran.  During one of the Shoutcraft kings matches the terrans early attack failed and you said the only thing the terran has going for him is  and the you said it again and then you said it again and again.  You listed several things that were in favor of the terran as if that was the only thing.  Its just an example.  On your stream Ive heard you put down protoss players in general and Zerg players in general saying easy race and amove race and adepts all day everyday one could just as easily say marines all day every day and your tone just is so negative.

He had never made it through a GSL qualifier what made him so unbeatable?

Morale was likely at an all time low. Even so he went  against a kid hes likely never even saw an actual game of in a style Koreans almost never used before this in probably the worst moment of his career. And yet he still made it a grueling series for neeb who  I mean stats rain and zest were  the inspiration for neeb.

If the game was popular then koreans would not care at all if there is even wcs same as they didnt care in time of bw back then the game was popular so leagues and teams were created there was huge viewership and demand for the game and therefore big corporation come with support. starcraft is no longer popular in korea and thats why this is happening. wcs region lock had zero impact on it. wcs region lock had impact only on korean players who were not good enough to compete in korean leagues while having the option to play in foreign leagues.

Its not about the skill floor or the skill ceiling or team based vs solo its about the fact that SC is a volatile mess.

In your head there should be a queue of actions that need to be performed. When you can perform an action quickly and then switch to the next immediately you get into a flow kind of state where you dont linger more than you need on a specific task. Once you play more certain things become engrained and free up mental resources for other things and you will find yourself playing faster and faster. This may not be helpful to you but I raised my APM by simply playing the SC and BW campaigns. The macro there is so much more difficult that you have to remember to do stuff and you have to have much more accuracy.

Also the grit of the art was a huge pro to BroodWar and finally even the shitty game mechanics like unit pathing eventually became a feature and made BroodWar fun.I would love to play BroodWar HD Remaster  p or k but these days Blizzard really has lost their soul their vision and then cause. Their new stuff is a affirmation that they are just a corporate machine fabricating games using their own internal formula that tastes like store mixed cookies with extra baking soda.... disgusting.Stargus is just interesting to watch and I noticed they came to Github recently and had some new development going on so I thought it might grow which is cool.,starcraft,d93vyuo,3,t5_2qpp6

9459357,0,t1_d9ewuim,It depends on what you are expecting from your work and the overall mood of the moment community wise if there are too many nonstandard maps on the ladder then you can see tournament organizers try and reach Mapmakers or better put they become more sensible and responsive when a Mapmaker tries to reach them in order to have his map used. But overall these last few years? Yes TLMC is the only contest and also is the only way you can get a map to ladderWCSBig Tournaments. Otherwise you are relegated to the smaller tournaments that pop up two to three times a year. BasetradeTV does not count as small tournament But like I mentioned it depends on what you are expecting from your work a new guy making maps will be thrilled for his map to be used on a  players tournament yet this also means that sadly those Melee Mapmakers that put hundreds and hundreds of hours into a single map while perfecting their skills and understanding of the game become disenfranchised and jaded seeing that the now days yearly mapmaking TLMC is highly volatile by changes on taste of the judges and direction the DevTeam wants to go which we dont know before hand.As a small example of volatility and Mapmaking work timeframes for the last TLMC TLMC which iirc occurred on Mayish of this year I had been preparing for it ever since late  novdecember. And I did so by making and improving my work on making interesting yet balanced nonstandard maps seeing that on the previous TLMC TLMC the DevTeam had been highly positive and interested on getting more of that type of maps I started working on nonstandard maps in order to deliver them cool things that they might like I worked for idk November  to until  month before the TLMC only on nonstandard maps I say  month before it because  weeks before the TLMC announced we were told that Nonstandard maps wouldnt be highly sought after. So yeah  weeks before the thing I was forced to basically trash months of work and start from scratch only this time with a  week timeframe I had to make  new maps where a single map can take that same amount of time to flesh out balance and iterate on. Same thing happened to other highly experimented mapmakers who were also working on more nonstandard layouts.The funny thing is that this very same thing had happened to me on the TLMC only the other way around on TLMC we were told that on TLMC the judges and DevTeam would also be seeking more standard maps only that this wasnt the case DevTeam changed its mind and now wanted nonstandard maps the thing that time is that no one told us that so many people delivered standard maps expecting that the st stage judges actually were seeking said maps only to our horror later learn that basically all good standard maps were immediately disqualified as soon as they were submitted. And thats the tale of how Bridgehead Terraform Dash And Terminal amp Moonlight Madness made it to the ladders map pool.Sometimes you see Mapmakers like Meavis above who responded you on a less than friendly fashion sadly there are reasons behind that. Making maps for SC is stupidly rough but it is stupidly rough for all the wrong reasons what I wrote here are just a couple examples among many many many other instances of terribly exasperating things happening onto the mapmaking scene.It is not my intention to discourage you making maps is tons of fun there is a reason I have been doing it for ish years and there are a couple other guys that have been making maps from BW times that are still around. Making them is a blast tho getting people to test them or trying to get them actually be played once they are done is a bitch.,starcraft,d9f1h3a,3,t5_2qpp6

9467992,0,t3_5adqgk,I agree and disagree. I absolutely agree that fourplayer maps are unfair in the current iteration of SCII. I agree that OPs suggestions would probably fix this. however I disagree with all the balance design choices which led us to this mess.Daedalus Point expanded the natural choke by  hexes and broke the game. Korhal Floating Island introduced  natural chokes and broke the game. Its a recurring theme in SCII. SCII units and build orders require extremely specific map conditions in order for the game to play out fairly. to me this is testament to bad game design.I come from a WCIII background where you have   and even  player maps in competitive v. each map is completely different from the next and there is a dominant strategy for each map. for example on Melting Valley orc players always open Blade Master to creep the Goblin Merchant then abuse the health fountains to get an edge in the midgame. however on Twisted Meadows the dominant orc strategy would be completely different. I only watch Brood War as a spectator but there is a lot of variation there too for example aironly maps and downward chokes.thats my main gripe really... WCIII design improved slowly over the years and opened itself to incredible map variation and strategy. SCII map conditions have tightened and there is little variation in strategy.,starcraft,d9g4vb2,1,t5_2qpp6

The largest part of the game based on player participation has always been the campaign and within the past year coop mode. There are countless players who only play singleplayer and maybe a bit of coop and arcade and never touch the ladder.Because offering free samples at the grocery store actually encourages people to buy the product. Sure you get lots of people who just show up for the free food but you also get a lot of people who buy it who would never have even considered buying it had they not had a sample.Because somehow games like DotA and LoL which have no paywalls against smurfing somehow maintain their ladder integrity and esports scenes.Because I want other players to play with and it gets really lonely being the only person in my Battle.net friends list who actually plays this game.,starcraft,dak1bnl,4,t5_2qpp6

9819159,0,t3_5fvvr4,Quite enjoyed this one. I think many of the designs that are talked about have been the case since WoL Protoss at that time Protoss representation wasnt a problem.I think the  most relevant points are that of too many abilities and Chrono Boost.Personally I love Protoss because it is the race with the most special case abilities and find joy in executing them all together. There are abilities however that dont have much decision making to them at all and just convolutes the problem. Void Rays as an ex. could easily have had a autotoggle on its Prism Alligntment ability as soon as it starts attacking any armoured unit or building. Though Blizzard did mention that some players in FFAs or team games enjoy massing Void Rays and then find joy in pressing that single button that makes things blow up.As for Chrono Boost this new LotV one really only feels like a chore you often find it Chronoing a building that is not in use but youre scared to Chrono something else since youre not sure which building will switch its Chrono target and theres an army just outside of your base!I waaay prefer the old Chrono Boost and find it more intuitive to use and I think for more experienced players its also easier to use. Couple this with the autoinject so that you can queue up Chronos on the same building to help out new users and I think Chrono Boost would be in a great place. It obviously would need to not be as strong as the old  increase but rather be something along the lines of .,starcraft,dange2p,46,t5_2qpp6

Someone said I shouldnt be doing brutal as low level too when leveled Stukov.  gt Its downright disrespectful to waste other peoples time.  This goes other way too. They think youre doing that to them. I personally think that about people who search brutal mutation without any chance of doing their part. Ive often left the game at min mark when I see my ally already proving by their buildorder to not be capable of beating the mutation that is harder than usual. Such as the previous week on Jinara mission. They are the ones who waste min of my time if I try my hardest to carry the game when eventually its not possible with allies who shouldnt even search hard.,starcraft,dbbhybl,4,t5_2qpp6

10009496,0,t1_dbbayre,gt The proposal I made to my friend is to just fix fast warp in. As it stands now slow warping is so annoying when you just have slow pylons. The area for fast warp in is so small around the nexus that if you have a pylon at your ramp on some maps the pylon isnt in the fast fast range area... It is so fucking annoying imo they should just increase the radius of fast warp around the nexus to cover pylons all around the base. Then they can remove fast warpin on pylons next to warpgates.Im pretty sure what determines if a Pylon provides fast or slow warpins is if theres either a Nexus or a Gatewaywarpgame within that Pylons psionic matrix range so Im not sure they CAN increase the radius a nexus specifically gives fast warpins.gtThe problem with fast warp gate next to gateways is that in most warpgate allins you will just place a gateway next to your proxy pylon which essentually breaks the home field advantage idea anyways. The gateway change is dumb and pylon warp speed design right noe is dumb.Requiring a proxy gatewaywarpgate is still a lot better than just a Pylon. It takes longer and is more resources lost ifwhen an opponent discovers your proxy and destroys it. I also think the idea is for it to work similar to a proxybarracks.However I can add that I think its a really unclear and almost Hidden mechanic what controls warpin speed. Its not very intuitive and something a new player needs to spend a bit of effort on learning since it isnt really something that is naturally and clearly conveyed ingame.gtWith warpprisms I guess they would have to remove them and add dropships which I dont even mind if they still have the same speed and pick up range. The warp prism is crazy fast and mobile so it doesnt even need proxy warp ins.I feel it would be too drastic to remove warpprism warpin capabilities entirely but I do wonder why warpprisms provide fast warpins.I think Warpprisms should provide slow warpins and then regain fast warpins after getting the warpprism upgrade.  ,starcraft,dbc9lc3,1,t5_2qpp6

I also wouldnt even say LoLCSGOetc have a community. People on reddit and twitch making memes accusing people of hacks and yelling at their games developers for bad choices isnt really a community its just people shouting in the same room. I would say it more or less feels more tight knit because you have to play in a team to play the games competitive mode. SC feels more empty because you never have to work cooperatively with people or even talk to them. Also community is probably the most overused term of recent years. Everything is a community now.

10093555,0,t1_dbn6ccu,Can you say a little more about this lack of map presence early game? Im a Protoss myself but what I find hardest are the Muta switches Alluton mentioned and dealing with mass HydrasLurkers. I find PvP and PvT extremely fun and engaging.For early game I dont find there is a paucity of options at all. PvP is replete with options so Ill ignore it.For PvZ there are a number of options from going Canons ZealotsVoids see Pigs youtube vid on it early Allins Adept pressure with Oracles Mass Oracles Oracles followed by Phoenix DT harass.I think the biggest problem is people are afraid to explore and try a wide variety of builds and are overly focussed with their ladder standing rather than building up a good base of skills.PvT VoidStalker timing see Stats vs Innovation in IEM it only failed because Inno scouted the forward pylon and had time to bunker up forward Pylon rushes OraclesPhoenix Harass Blink timings.If you took on bad habits from the HoTS days and just played macro at home until a death ball I can see how the game isnt fun since that doesnt really work anymore. A lot of the builds I mentioned dont require a crazy amount of micro except maybe DT harass with warp prism. They are simple compositions that are effective. The hard part is identifying if your opponent has the right counter and changing up your plan accordingly.What I love about Protoss is precisely the wide variety of options available that makes the game fun precisely because I dont just do the same thing over and over like a robot until I have it down to perfection.,starcraft,dbn7fb2,1,t5_2qpp6

10111427,0,t3_5kmpjy,Not in the slightest. They didnt really dig down and address some of the issues people are complaining about. Sure we got a lot of changes but they were not as drastic as they made it seem. Sure the changes will impact the meta but theu are not the big changes a lotpf people were hoping for. Then they kind of gave up they didnt try anything real crazy during this time. I would have loved for them to for example test cutting the mothership core and experiment with other ways to help protoss. Really hope they do more passes. There are still units wib subpar spells Infestor Ghost Raven. Still units that need help Mutas need an evolution carrier Still a heavy focus on killing workers and heavy harass gameplay. Really want to see them take an approach like heroes of the storm where if something isnt working they drill down and go through a heroes talents and home in on what makes the hero cool and how to bring that out. Right now the Balance team has more of a smooth things over for another  months approach.

10178131,0,t3_5lqgn5,Not knowing the maps all that well was the cause of more than a few losses for me early on when I got back into SC recently. I can remember clearly a bunch of siege tanks hitting my natural from a place I had no way to get to quickly because I hadnt even realized such an attack was possible from there. The good news is if you play more games the maps will become very familiar to you and even rather boring to be honest.Skip the shower and cake and instead watch the replay. Put it on a slower speed if you need to so you dont miss anything. Look at where you made mistakes and look and see where your opponent made mistakes too many people overlook this but youre missing out on half of what you can learn if you dont also study your opponents missteps. Key questions to ask yourself are Was I building enough workers? Because a worker will pay for itself fairly quickly a worker is pretty much the best unit in the game you can build. Hows my spending? If Im floating extra resources what could I have spent them on at that time that wouldve helped? When youve got extra resources its best to expand build more production buildings or build more units. Generally whoever is spending best wins. Did I always know where the enemy army was? What attacks didnt I scout? If I had scouted them what could I have done to defeat them? What telltale signs in the enemy base would have told me what units they were going to attack me with? Knowing where and what your enemy is and what theyre doing is critical. For each engagement did I choose the best place to fight? Did I need to fight then? Would it have been better to retreat and at what point? Not every fight is worth it and often preserving your army is a better move than destroying or hurting the enemys army. Was I remembering to upgrade my troops? Was I planning for my next level of tech while fighting with my current tech level? Timing attacks with upgrades finishing is a key skill in winning engagements. Who in the game was in control over the map and had the most freedom of movement? If it wasnt me what could I have done to win control? The player with the ability to expand at will and keep their economy going is generally going to win against the player who is trapped in their base.,starcraft,dbxqwwl,8,t5_2qpp6

10236785,0,t1_dc4dr1k,One tank? For sure. However the attack seems to depend on two things Zealots being at the front to absorb the initial hits which allows the DTs to get into range for blink.  DTs are in a group to create high damage output. Defensive force in a clump that the Zealots can shepherd comfortably. Spreading out especially with more than one tank will force the DTs to take damage and will prevent your forces from clumping which is good for preventing a sudden burst of charge damage. It also allows for kiting the DTs after the initial blink.  ,starcraft,dc4eaii,1,t5_2qpp6

To continue with my other points though So you can get  after  seconds at that time terran will still have  for  seconds making the timing still possible. I never talked about a  vs  timing or something like that but about a  vs  timing which gives the toss a  upgrade lead. Something else to think about is that when you get those forges at the same time as the terran ebay you will have about  workes as toss so you dont really need the chrono for more workers at that point. ,starcraft,dc72cjr,2,t5_2qpp6

Melee and Smash  both have big competitive scenes and there are a handful of top players who will compete in both games.  Generally a Smash tournament will have brackets for both Melee and Smash  including singles and doubles.EDIT  I will also note that there is very limited competition between Melee and Smash .  Generally Smash fans have a favorite game but wholly support the other game as wellthey just dont follow it as closely or play it as much.  I will make a pretty stark contrast between Smash and Starcraft here in that I see so much more hate for SC from the Brood War fans than I see for Smash  from Melee fans.

I know they cant hit libs with range but I often see Protosses dying or complaining that they rely so much on the MSC positioning. The way they used to deal with drops before Pylon OC was with cannons in the edge instead of pylons and quick reaction.Thats something that bothers me alot Yeah drops are really hard to deffend if you are not in position or close Fuck yes Im Zerg and Drops are hard but static deffense was put in the game for a reason and its not only to cannon rush people.,starcraft,dcmrljx,-2,t5_2qpp6

Heres a transcript of the linked blue post for those of you at work Community Feedback Update  January  Traysent  Community Manager Posted on behalf of Lead Multiplayer Designer David Dayvie KimLiberator Concord Cannon damage changed from  to .While there has been a lot of great feedback regarding suggestions for PvT this change looks to be the solution proposed by many players out there. However we wanted to confirm with you before making this move. Because a change like this targets the specific problem and is a very small change outside of that we wanted to get your thoughts on possibly pushing this out to the live game as early as next week.  Further ChangesThe above change will definitely make a difference in PvT so we want to make sure things are looking good before making other balance calls. So any further changes will most likely go to the Balance Test Map first. We are currently still seeing discussions around Carrier strength in PvZ Widow Mine strength in PvT and Hydra health changes. If further changes are needed we will take action on them as well. This balance test map can go live as early as next week as well so please give us your thoughts.

10534246,0,t3_5qtffq,What youre missing is that balance needs to consider when a race has certain tools at its disposal.  If Terran literally cannot get detection in time thats a balance issue.  And much around RTS games is about timing.  Who can get more units quicker who can get a tech advantage quicker who can get an economic advantage quicker.  Everything is based around this idea.  If you arent doing this then youre falling behind and will lose.  When Lurkers were OP it wasnt necessarily the unit itself but how early the unit was available. Lurkers were popping out before Protoss really could respond to it.  Now you might argue then change Protoss units.  Except this will then unbalance other areas of the game such as PvT simply to solve an issue with Lurkers.,starcraft,dd268qg,1,t5_2qpp6

As tedious and mundane as it is these types of mechanics do draw a lot of attention from Zerg players as well as Terran and Protoss players from their own macro mechanics and nuisances. Im sure all players would like some of their own racial mechanics to become easier or more automated.The age old argument is whether we want to make the game harder or easier and in what ways. A lot of SC enthusiasts especially the older ones always like to compare BW to SC and BW obviously has a lot of these small quirky problems that makes everything a lot more difficult. Those difficulties are the bare minimal APM requirements that really set the different between being a DCBA player. ,starcraft,ddez5rw,9,t5_2qpp6

10751645,0,t1_ddo665v,I did read the whole post actually. Im sympathetic to how hard it is to control your observers during a fight without losing them. But thats exactly how I feel with my overseers when I have to fight skytoss. Detection and its control is an important component of the game. If you consider losses due to lack of detection gimmicky that invalidates swathes of dt banshee and burrow play. Observers require a separate hotkey and should be on follow command. Thats easy to say here but obviously in the chaos of battle things dont always play out in the desired way. And that is the beauty and the exasperation of SC. However I feel Protoss already hold the ascendancy in this matchup. Im loathe to make it any easier for you! ,starcraft,ddoy7d5,1,t5_2qpp6

Do you know the standard  Nexus opener?.CIA should crush lurkers in a normal fight. Make sure to spread your army before engaging to reduce as much lurker splash damage as possible. Disruptors are also good if combined with blink stalkers but it needs way more micro the CIA..I cant give a concrete answer here. If your opponent is playing mech you should engage with pure blink stalkers. Get a second Robo and go ChargelotImmortal or go Skytoss against mech armys. If your opponent goes biotank then get Colossi Adepts with glaives AND blink stalkers. Wach any given pro game to get an idea for the unit comp. .You will have to transition into Disruptors at one point in PvP. You shouldnt die to nonDisruptorcompositions as soon as you have  Disruptors because you can blow up the entire enemy army so fast. Also pls dont go storm in PvP if you dont face mass void ray compositions.The most important thing is that you scout! Scout if your opponent goes all in if he does a weird transition etc...

Showtime is playing stripes and hes  balls ahead of Gumiho but at the end of the game he scratches while sinking the ball and Gumiho wins.  Do you think that mechanic should be removed from billiards because clearly Showtime deserved to win?Showtime majorly fucked up by inexplicably walking his entire army away from the only building in the game that he needed to protect when he KNEW that Gumiho had forces in medivacs and he was punished for it by receiving a draw.

What I said and Im still right is we need a T option vs air units that trades well what I said was add hunter killers to the game a T morph unlocked at hive for the hydra to make them useful late game. It would cost to upgrade the hydra to the hunter killer but it would have much more HP and be able to trade well vs the protoss ball. Then we have infestors and hunter killers vs the protoss ball. Use the infestors to fungal the ball of units trade spore shots and hunter killer DPS for interceptors and be cost efficient.

The boy did this same thing every day for a week and every time the men of the village would run to him to help and every time he would laugh in there face because it was just a prank. Then one day the boy went into the woods to do his joke when a wolf actually chases him out of the forest the boy runs into town yelling A WOLF IS COMING! A WOLF IS COMING! But this time the town knew the boys tricks and this time they didnt go to check because they figured the boy was just lying again. The boy was then eaten by the wolf because no one believed there was even a wolf in the first place because of the jokes or in avilos case Memes and tricks he had done previously.

Else go  hatch lurkers to secure early gas third expo while getting swarm as soon as possible.Why so many pro zerg go  hatch muta still is because it gives you somewhat of mapcontrol and you can hold off  rax if your micro is very good  you dont miss a beat in macro. ZvT is probably the hardest there is in Broodwar until th minute where you should have swarm already with th gas base going from which on you should be secure but if you fall behind it is GG.

According to the video however executing certain builds timing attacks allins will result only in short term improvement whereas the player that ignores them will improve more in the long term. That seems incorrect. Having the threat of a well executed timing attack keeps opponents from getting too greedy and cutting corners.

11455408,0,t1_dfufcgg,And how exactly might I ask do you know what the hell my intentions and motivations are?When I play vs my students I always try my best to win to illustrate the entire point that strategy and micro especially in the lower leagues is a giant red herring and that understanding the basic rules of macro such as dont build things unless you can use them such as forges before you have enough gas or the opposite gasses before you can use gas is far more important.Are you suggesting I should have simply let the student in that example kill all my buildings with his superior army?  What is there to be learned from that?  Already the lower leagues are plagued by people playing glorified Unit Tester and doing things like massing  Void Rays by the  minute mark and winning simply because they got to reach a deathball and the opponents at their level had an inferior deathball.This replay is an excellent example of a relatively high league player gold for the lower leagues going into a hard counter composition and despite numerous very very obvious mistakes still nearly being able to win simply based off of the fact that their composition being a hard counter.  However they werent able to beat what is objectively a terrible strategy.  Its a great replay for making it very clear that the numerous decision making mistakes wouldnt have even mattered had the ginormous macro mistakes had not been present.GGtrackers spending quotient for the protoss puts it at Bronze at   whereas mine that game was Grandmaster at .  Had the tosss spending quotient been at a gold level he would have wiped the floor of that game easily.The casting super emphasized these points like the early gas the  supply put into probes etc.Youre the one thats making the random assumption that I sent in the replay to bully one random student.  Then posted to reddit to bully further.  How does that benefit me at all in that Im trying to advertise out for more students to teach?This replay and casting is a perfect example of how even with virtually no micro no upgrades whatsoever being hard countered but with only pure macro you can beat even Gold players.Its something thats super not intuitive as most of the students I interact with in the lower leagues are under the assumption that such a thing is literally impossible and that unless their micro game sense scouting and all these other things improve  that they dont need to address their macro as its either good enough or as good as their opponents and not a major factor in their losses.No other game has this problem as widespread as the starcraft community and we need more videos like this on this subreddit to hammer home this point that just improve your macro isnt just a meme but its literally the entire language of REALTIME strategy gamesTell me a single comment ive left in this thread that leads you to believe that im posting this so everyone can just make fun of one person?,starcraft,dfugnil,1,t5_2qpp6

11464892,0,t3_63nlxb,Id disagree that Zerg is always harder to play than Protoss. I agree Zerg is the hardest to start so different from other RTS and Terran the easiest closest to other RTS. At Diamond where I am Id say P is harder than Z I have  ZvP but thats because I suck as I can sit back and make ling bane ravager while my opponent has to worry about good forcefields and storms and applying pressure with Adepts to not let me just sit back and macro. At pro level its different its too easy to micro a warp prism and  Archons and do free damage as you wont lose the WP or the Archons. Its easy enough to micro  WP that pro players sometimes doing double WP harass while macroing while Zerg cant do much counter play to this they can just mitigate their losses. I also dont think Terran becomes the hardest until high tier Korean Pro level. Many agree Terran has the highest skill cap but nobody really gets near that except your InnoVation tier players so less than  players. Masters is for sure not the factor where Terran becomes harder Masters is way waaaaaaaaaaay below top korean pro.,starcraft,dfvjejy,2,t5_2qpp6

11469413,0,t1_dfw0f4q,It likely has to do with his skill level.  If you are in the lowest tier or the very highest tier Matchmaking will take longer because there are not many players in the game at your skilllevelnot to mention low level players dont play as much as diamondmasterGM players.  The VAST majority of people are either in Gold Plat or Diamond.  If youre below or above these ranks your MM time can be highersometimes a couple  higher.  I dont think its as bad at the low ranks as it is at the highestGM.Also it depends the gamemode.  Not many people play archon mode.  Not many play v for lagperformance reasons.  Most serious players dont take v seriously because its too many potential matchups to consider.  v is the most popular and v is in second with a big drop off after that.Ever since CoOp v v v ranked have taken a hit.  I suspect that a lot of Casual ranked players like myself who used to ONLY play v v v switched over to CoOp.

11551922,0,t1_dg5e8x5,gt to give some perspectiveNot sure why I need perspective.  This Protoss player was on two bases versus four or five ... or six.  Juicy shots or no his opponent was far far ahead and rightfully should be planning to win with a tech switch after trading armies.He didnt exactly trade successfully so his switch should be immediate and desperate.  If he had the bank he should have had on so many more bases before attacking then the results are a foregone conclusion.Either that situation obtains or likely both players suck and the shown attack was the zerg with his entire army as soon as he was maxed out fighting in a poor position with immobile units versus disruptors  and seeing as this is quite possibly the worst possible situation he probably didnt have much of a bank behind it when attacking.Then the game would be long and drawn out because the opponent has much more economy and could bear an allin barely which would invite the counterattack and the inevitable countercounter attack and so on.Or Im wrong.

Having said all that mate I really cant understand the suggestions you made above and to be honest cant work out if theyre not just trolling for the sake of it.I think widow mines are quite fine to be honest. There are several layers of counter possible when they get dropped in your base. Another point theyve just had the mine nerfed you want to be that guy calling for another nerf on same unit? Isnt that what were complaining about? The Lib also just got a nerf so same point there. And cmon you want to make tanks fucking seige tanks mate take  shots to kill infantry units? Its a fucking tank mate.I dont know enough about Zerg to have strong comment about their drop tech but maybe just let them keep it mate? Sounds like something they can have fun with in the early game. Regards Muta maybe just fill your line with stalker and StaticD seems to work fine for me nothing too crazy there. For the lings I think youve just got ot use the tech youve got out to fend them off?Protoss is always going to get the stick and its because of the way they work. We have a lot of units that do crazy niche super powerful shit. Use it right youll wreck the place. Drop attention miss that moment let your shit get killed for free or fumble your control were as much dead weight.

11801286,1,t1_dgxpkuj,I havent seen him cast since forever but I remember him from back in the day as having a super whiney stream and thinking he wasnt going to last long as a caster. Since hes still around Im guessing he keeps it most in his personal stream still. ,starcraft,dgxpt83,-1,t5_2qpp6

11806412,0,t3_68ghe5,Honestly this was more of a mistake on SpeCials part rather than a big play by Neeb but Neeb sure did take advantage of that mistake. ,starcraft,dgyapyw,-6,t5_2qpp6
11806485,0,t1_dgyapyw,Hmm? I disagree. He needed his widow mines to get a bigger hit than one stalker since he was so far behind anyways so he unburrowed to cancel the shot. Not to mention that Need smartly had the targeted stalker following the liberator so it wouldve hit that as well.,starcraft,dgyb0ol,9,t5_2qpp6
11806884,0,t1_dgybfc1,One stalker blinked forward to bait a shot from the  mines. The friendly splash damage wouldve been devastating.,starcraft,dgycn9e,8,t5_2qpp6
11809172,0,t1_dgylu5y,I dont want the devs to tell me what the best strategies are. I want them to say something like we want the zergs to have very good defense and aim for getting tier  as fast as possible. So our balance will be towards that not towards say buffing lings. Im not looking for strategies or the meta. ,starcraft,dgylzsr,1,t5_2qpp6
