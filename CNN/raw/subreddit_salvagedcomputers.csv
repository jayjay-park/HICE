Here is a cast full of actors required to be silly while keeping a straight face and somehow they have developed a faith that the screenplay is funny and of course their belief makes it funny and there you are. And it would be worth renting the video just to study Peet s face and listen to her voice during her early encounters with the Tulip. She makes it all look so easy we forget that what she accomplishes is just about impossible She is funny because of her personality without resorting to a funny personality. They don t teach that in acting school.The material was quite interesting but it should have been reworked to really make it a standout film. I really wanted to enjoy this but I was disappointed with the result we got. Some parts are funny but most of the time the gags falls flat and halfway through the film everything just falls apart. I had heard some good things about this one but overall it fails and it has minimal laughs. This could have been something great given a rewrite or two but the plot ends up being tiresome and tedious with no sense of how it should conclude in an effective way.It turns out that Frankie and Jimmy are old friends and together are planning to take out Janni and Cynthia. Oz returns to work and tells Jill about the events in Chicago. Jill is extremely excited when she finds out Jimmy the Tulip is Oz s neighbor and makes Oz take her to meet him. Jill tells Jimmy that he s her hero and the reason she wants to be a contract killer.Synopsis Oz is a Montral dentist paying off debts so he can divorce his wife the dislike is mutual. All of the principal cast members are back as. I say it is perfect because it exactly matches what is required and then adds a level of heedless glee. They then put the cop s body and Janni s into Oz s car and set it on fire rendering the bodies unidentifiable except by dental records. One of the reasons for that reaction is a perfect performance by Amanda Peet.He tells Jimmy that it s obvious he s in love with her. Jimmy acts confused thinking Oz is referring to Cynthia. In the next shot Jill runs on the boat and jumps into Jimmy s arms. Oz leaves to meet Cynthia..   ,salvagedcomputers,cx81j3x,1,t5_2wd5q
