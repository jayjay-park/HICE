68130,0,t3_1uvy2d,I found Sonic CD an excellent entry but a little too complex for my fumbling child hands. Too many odd platforms to jump to and too much effort spent on trying to travel back to destroy robot generators and that mechanical monstrosity.

As others have said theres a Generations PC mod The Unleashed Project that... well youve read what uCaptainL said haha but itd be sweet if somebody took the time to hack the Werehog levels and potentially create a setting for removing medal requirements and whatnot etc. out of a PSXbox image of the game which could then be emulatedburnt back onto disc to be played on a cracked console so that people like yourself could have another whack at the game with less of the BS. Wouldnt mind attempting something like that at some point though my hacking knowledge is pretty minimal asis.

Our recent reports confirm that it blowsgtNo good sonic games ever come out its too inconsistent!gtEtc.Everyone of these pisses me off for every imaginable reason.Sonic will never... EVER be sold under any circumstance. I would go so far as to say that even if SEGA goes under the franchise will die with it.   Imagine if Nintendo continued to bomb after  and went under selling Mario off to Valve?Just think of how stupid that would be. Plus somebody somewhere wants to keep those sweet sweet merchandising rights.As for games media shitting on our favorite poo covered rodent Its easy revenue to poke us by saying that Sonic is crashing and burning because we ARE such a large and loud fanbase. We provide them with tons of view cash money and keep them relevant. The behavior that people come to expect from us makes it just as entertaining to entertain this idea. What media says and what is true are often very wrong on purpose or by misinformation.As for not being optimistic about SEGA well...If we werent optimistic about hundreds of thousands of our soldiers and dollars being lost for a war in a foreign continent WWII would have gone a lot differently eh?

5228554,0,t1_cvg4av4,I wasnt being a dick I was being real with him. If you truly like something that is that horrible then you need to be told that your tastes are poor. He says that Chris is indeed whiny and annoying but not overwhelming. Yes he is overwhelming. A lot of people say The show should be called Chris X for a reason. Hes in every episode and it can be argued that he is the shows protagonist not sonic. That being said if we get that whiny and annoying garbage every episode it IS overwhelming.Second thing is the voice acting. Its absolute trash. You COULD attribute this to kids considering they direct their voice actors to talk a certain way so that kids can more easily grasp the dialogue but its still corny and poorly done. Jason Griffith is a great voice for Sonic but his acting upon until Unleashed was just poor. I think that he improved a lot once he got to Unleashed. But back at Sonic X it was awful. Not to mention other cheesy voice actors like Dan Green. The only exception is of course Mike Pollock. The only thing I can agree on was it was kind of cool seeing the Adventure games animated. It wasnt done properly but what they did was at least interesting to see. That is the ONLY part of Sonic X that I would remotely find enjoyable. Once you get to the Metarex saga is exactly where the show tanks to its fullest. Its Star Trek with furries where they shoot Sonic out of a canon over and over to solve their problems. Also the plot beyond the entire season is cliched as all hell and The Metarexs motives as an antagonist are LAUGHABLE. A race of Cybernetic beings come to destroy all organics....yeah thats never been done before. There is NO character development for anyone except for Tails when he starts getting a crush on Cosmo probably one of the only interesting parts of the shows third season. Not to mention all the overall poorer aspects of the show Bland music reusing animation to the point of it being ridiculous poor writing and character dialogue plot holes ESPECIALLY in the Adventure arc the censorship kids fault not the show and EVERYTHING mentioned before all mixed into this...makes for one giant stinker of an anime. I apologize for being rude before. But this show is THAT bad and I just cant get my head around anyone actually enjoying it unless they either just have poor taste or havent been exposed to enough GOOD media to know what is shit what is mediocre and what is amazing. And before you say Its a kids show that is not an excuse for mediocrity.,SonicTheHedgehog,cvg8cv5,-2,t5_2rh21

Not because because I think its a bad game heck Im sure its a great perfectly functional game. No what I hate about it is what it stands for.It was made during a time when we were still healing from the wounds of Sonic  which to be honest is not the worst game out there. Heck its not even the worst Sonic game Ive ever played  that award goes to Sonic  on the Game Gear where the notion of something like multiple playable characters was seen as a bad idea because it was in  and therefore it could never work s. And while they could have just built on what made Sonic ampK so great because it incorporated multiple playing styles throughout all of its levels the developers decided to go screw that and just make a Sonic  clone. It wouldntve annoyed me so much if it wasnt for everyone else lapping it up as if was the way it was always meant to be.Theres a reason I still call it the Classic Trilogy I like to regard Sonic  and Sonic amp Knuckles as just two halves of the same game. If anything Sonic Advance  is more of a sequel to Sonic ampK than Sonic  since that game built on and expanded upon the formula.,SonicTheHedgehog,cx29fpx,-1,t5_2rh21

6279348,0,t3_41jcn1,The gameplay was total crap in both games but they did have some pretty cool premises. I wouldnt mind them being revived if they simply just made them play like the typical Sonic game and just set within these particular worlds. No motion controls no bizarre gimmicks.To answer your question though if a poll Sega did years back is anything to go by Greek mythology was the most popular choice for a new Storybook setting.That could have been interesting if only to see which Sonic characters would fill the roles of various gods and the like.

8366855,0,t3_4u6t0l,BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA.....And the mystery game was GENERATIONS !!! SEGA and Sonic Team showed us the future and thats taking the easy way out!! MMMMMMM.....The butt hurt from the SA fags feels soo good!Real talk though this was the smartest move they couldve done they needs games that will win back the love of the casual gaming community because Sonic fans are already in the palm of their hands No matter how much they bite and scratch. The emphasis on Classic Sonic has been pretty telegraphed since last year and it shows how much his appearance just elevates the brand just be association. TShirts Plushies Comic Books Mobile Phones Video Games if you wanna make bank outta Sonic then Classic  is the way to go. Modern only appeals to the faction of the fanbase that grew up during the dawn of the internet and they dont have enough financial influence to sway casuals from constantly shitting on Sonics failures as of yet. So SEGA wisely chose to return to their last real big hit and expand on it. Anything else even if it was something the fans wanted would have met in failure. Like everyone already said SEGA covered all their bases and have something good for everyone...well everyone except those looking for SA.This whole presentation was actually nicely balanced There was no real major hype for the fans but SEGA managed to listened to a few of their suggestions such as giving Chris Whitehead an original Sonic game to work on slowing down development time to give priority and going back to perfect the Boost formula after abandoning it for something else. However its clear that SEGAs marketing since the Twitter page began wasnt about making an impact or changing the game but winning back the trust of the gaming community. For Sonic fans though this may have been a pill too tough for some to stomach. But I bet you all the selfdeprecating memes cartoony humor and lack of respect will be worth it when Sonic Mania and Generations  get decent scores and make good money helping regain that lost boost of momentum.,SonicTheHedgehog,d5nep49,-13,t5_2rh21

I dont want Mania having remixed stages of classic stages or it will be Sonic  all over again. Yeah Sonic  stages had different names but once you started playing them you couldnt help but draw comparisons to the classics. I want Mania to have remixes of modern stages that we havent seen in D. I feel like that will make the game fresher. If you look at Green Hill Zone it almost looks exactly like the original. Yeah theres changes but its still the same old Green Hill Zone. I dont want to see that with Classic Sonic levels. If theyre gonna remake stages remake ones that havent been in D. Yeah it sure wont make sense in terms of canon since Mania takes place after ampK but who cares? Finally I dont want an abundance of reimagined stages.

9862525,0,t3_5gjjgt,I have a headcanon about Hyper Sonic and the Super Emeralds. I dont think the Super Emeralds need to come back both as a mechanic and as a story point because I dont think they ever left.Before Sonic  and Knuckles the chaos emeralds looked like this They then transformed into the super emeralds and looked like thisSince Sonic  and Knuckles they have kept their brilliant diamond cut forms rather than their Sonic  and  forms.I think that since becoming the Super Emeralds in Sonic  and Knuckles the Chaos Emeralds have always been the Super Emeralds characters only to refer to them as Chaos Emeralds because Super Emeralds was only something only we use out of universe. To the characters theyve only ever been the Chaos Emeralds.While Hyper Sonic does have more raw power than SaK Super Sonic it was a lot less efficient. Hyper Sonic wasted a lot of energy shown by the way he continually changed color. PostSonic  and Knuckles Sonic has more control over the raw power of the Super Emeralds and is now able to use their power while using the more efficient more in control Super Form. SaK Super SonicltSaK Hyper SonicltPostSaK Super SonicTherefore Hyper Sonic is no longer a thing.

10490039,0,t3_5q5cfl,Im a decently big Sonic fan but I think your argument lines could use some work. I dont quite know where I stand on Sonic Adventure . The game is decently good but it has lots of flaws that are not only exclusive to the game but seem to be of the era. Anyways Im going to see if I cant help out OPs argument here.gt Reason   Children dont like everything.So I write a good amount of essays on literature as I am doing an English minor. Now Im not going to proof read this post so you can probably get back at me for that but anyways. In an argument you can not make a claim such as your reason number one. You only speak for yourself. Also you can not back your claim. Essentially dont tell people what they may or may not think.A claim you can make is Sonic Adventure  had high reviews at its release. I dont know if its true or not. Notice how it still gets the point across that the game was praised among its release but you can back it up.gt  A childs opinion is just as valuable and meaningful as any adults opinion.I guess? personally I go back on my own opinions. I was ecstatic when my mother got my brother and I SA out of the  dollar bargain bin because we were good. I put hours into the game but I do not think I critically thought about the game or the game design. But I digress. This is a claim I would never make because I do not know how to possibly make it and do it well.I think what you are getting at is that the game is fun. So maybe write The game is shown to be fun even though it has some mechanical issues. I dont think that is a good claim either though. How to prove something is fun? We can prove mechanical problems but I dont know how anyone would give evidence that the game is fun. Maybe a claim such as Though the main narrative and game play is rather shallow the Chao garden mini game is mechanically deep. You can kind of prove both of those claims and I still think they prove your point that the game is fun for children and people returning to play it as an adult.gt Reason   There have been adults that never played the game as kids and still love the game.You could refine this point but I think you can prove it. If you were to cite authors of positive reviews who are adults then it would be acceptable. Still it is pretty weak and I think your whole argument is inherently flawed but well get to that.gt Reason   What about all of the fans of the Classic games then?You are correct. Those people are hypocritical. This feels a little bit gate keeperish though. This claim is good though because you can cite evidence to prove your point. Just remember that someone who is a fan of Sonic does not need to like every single game. Sonic and the secret rings in my opinion is not a good game. But overall I would call myself a Sonic fan and the Sega Genesis Sonic games are a part of my collection that Im happy to own. Id say overall this argument works but I would not make it. I would not make it because it is not inline with your original point that SA is good without nostalgia.A huge lesson I learned when I write is to keep my argument grounded to the point I am trying to make. Stay on track and do not add random out of focus stuff like this.gt  Reason   It has plenty of things in it that people enjoy.   This is not bad writing. This point is obviously something you could prove by citing reviews. The Chao garden was amazing.All in all though your argument is pretty flawed and here is why. Your post saysgt No Sonic Adventure  is NOT praised because of blind nostalgia.And then only your final point talks about how the game was good. I would suggest you revise this post in such a way that you stick to the game as the topic.What I would suggest is that you write about how the game has many design decisions of the era it was released in. So the idea that their are three level types which is really different than todays standards. To my understanding at least. Now in literature some scholars say that the author is dead and that you only look at the narrative and not the context is was released in. But that is only with contemporary literature and I think that writing about gaming you need to add the context of the industry and the games of the era.Then Id probably write how the controls and the game design are still relevant and work well or something in todays context. I do not know if we are trying to say that the game is good in todays standards or by its own standards. Im assuming by todays standards.Finally I think the best argument you can make and it disregards my entire post but. The game is fun. Which is suggestive. So you it is a claim that you can not prove in a satisfactory way anyways. But all and all if you like the game then it doesnt matter what other people think.Finally using caps to emphasis words is tacky and makes me hurt in a place I promised to never let people hurt me at.If you made it this far down my post than I guess congratulations. Personally I enjoy SA and I love writing especially about video games. I also need some warm up before writing some essays this term and this post looked like it could get my creative juices flowing. Anyways if you are passionate about games write about. Ask you teachers or profs about being able to tie your love of gaming into your writing. So many students hate English because its not applicable but I swear its fun when you love the topic. If anyone has any questions comments concerns and or anything else about my post just hit me up. OP if I wasnt poor Id buy you gold for allowing me go through your post.TDLR Some crazy English student goes through a post on SA to try and help OPs writing. I swear its on topic.,SonicTheHedgehog,dcx5mq8,6,t5_2rh21

10538251,0,t3_5qpcow,I think Unleashed is part of the modern era. There are things it shares with Dreamcast and Dark Age games but previous eras started with radical game changes. Adventure was the first D game so the classic era ended.

10551170,0,t1_dd379iz,Heres a good list of mods to look through.Out of all the character mods I personally like the Classic Sonic mod. But the animations are buggy in the version youll download there. I fixed them myself but I should probably ask the original author of the mod before I upload anything. Theres another version that only uses the normal lost world animations with the Classic model but I cant seem to find a working download link for that. But there are plenty of other character mods to choose from so you might find something else that looks better for you whether its an improved default model or something else.The other one Id highly recommend would be the minimal hud mod. It just removes some of the clutter.If you want to play the game without any of the bosses they can drag on the levels then I suggest the Nonexistent Six Edition mod.,SonicTheHedgehog,dd43dr9,1,t5_2rh21

Yours is different than mine and thats cool you are entitled to have that opinion. But the relative quality of the two games wasnt even my point.My point was that Lost World represents a similar level of experimental lack of refinement to Unleashed bugs and flaws in the core gameplay and level design gameplay ideas poorly shoehorned in from other popular games of the time that sort of thing. The flaws in Unleashed were more or less eliminated in the more refined Colours and Generations and I was just suggesting that it would have been interesting to see if a second game on the Lost World engine could have learnt similar lessons and improved on the original.
