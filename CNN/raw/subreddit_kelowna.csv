The cable box has always been snappy and I prefer their interface by far.  As for internet Im on HS .  I do a fair bit of downloading but for my I required the higher upload speeds for my work.  So far it hasnt let me down.A word of caution...where you live can tremendously impact what services you get.  I live in a little wartime house downtown and for the first six months I was limited to their most basic internet offerings however the next block over had no such problem.  The Telus tech I spoke with said theyre almost constantly improving their areas but just be forewarned. ,kelowna,cnlb0aa,1,t5_2rtgc

I am talking about full roundabouts which have a dedicated circular lane and medians at the entranceexit points that make entry a default option without any other choices. Kelowna has no traffic circles only roundabouts.With roundabouts signalling should only ever occur for exiting and would be the right turn signal. Period.,kelowna,d0musok,2,t5_2rtgc
