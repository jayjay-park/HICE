If I know nothing more I know your random seed will be selected in a pool of about  million choices. It will take me a while to try all of the seeds but I will crack whatever it is that you are trying to protect fairly quickly.If I know more about the temperature such that it is somewhere between  degrees C where you are measuring I narrow it even further.

What I meant was that acknowledging that heroin has a stigma associated with it it may take a lot to convince people to use that as a treatment for addiction.  So while it may be intuitive that those risks decline with heroin administered under an addiction program my guess is that it would have to be demonstrated in a randomized trial and shown to be different than the methadone group.  Another reason aside from the stigma is that there are clearly more problems with people selfadministering an injectable medication.  The authors of that paper point out overdosing and seizures but there is a table in the fulltext which includes smaller numbers of things like various bacterial infections.  So there is a risk associated with it and the only true benefit shown is that those patients are more likely to stay in a program.  Its a soft outcome to base revamping the entire approach to addiction.

Say the rod breaks at stress S.The weight of the rod is Wg  density  length  area and so SWarea. So we see S gt g  density  length in order for the rod to not break. That is for a given material the only variable that determines whether a given material will break is the length.This is a first order approximation meaning it is ballpark correct. But tricky things can happen if the material has a more complex stressstrain relationship or the column shape is odd.

The first is that the moon is really close to us. As Snuggler explained that makes the earthmoon attraction substantially stronger on the side of the earth closest to the moon.  As a result water literally bulges outward on this side of the earth causing one tide each day.The second key is more subtle because the moon is a pretty massive object compared to our planet the center of mass of the earthmoon combo is actually not at the earths center. As a result the earth actually spins around this offcentered axis creating a water bulge on the far side of the planet away from the moon. Consequently our planet experiences two tides per day as the planet surfs underneath these two water bulges.Credit all to Galileo a rock star in any age.,askscience,cefkx1z,8,t5_2qm4e10647,0,t1_cefm5sv,Awesome!

If we set up a quantum computer correctly we can force it to find that answer for us using entangle particles.This is possible because entangled particles act like they are in all states at once.  It is like they are everything at once.  We can place certain constraints on the particles and they will tend to fit together in a certain way.  Measuring the way the particles interfere with each other after we tweak other particles in certain ways gives us the answer we were looking for.This allows us to solve problems that would normally involve checking many different things when looking for our answer.

Unfortunately virtually all of these encryption systems there are different ones for GSM vs. G vs LTE vs etc. are relatively weak in that they contain multiple known security holes.  It makes the interchange between the handset and the tower fairly safe from many attackers but probably not from a very capable hacker.    To provide endtoend encryption of a call youd need to have a system that provided interoperability between different systems. After a call makes it to the tower it can be passed on through landlines to different networks and eventually perhaps to a cellphone user on a different network using a different standard.    With a smartphone you could reasonably have this.  If both parties used a smartphone with an encryption program using the same system then it should be possible to do endtoend encryption and make it reasonably secure. You can also do this with computerbased VOIP systems like Skype.  PGPfone for example.    Of course you can also create the same kind of thing using hardware. Special STUIII phones have been used by government agencies for example which contain an encryption function. As long as they are communicating with a phone with the same hardware function the phone can have endtoend encryption which is strong.

One could have a string theory that did not predict Higgs bosons and one could have a particle theory with Higgs bosons without requiring that it be extended to a string theory.  Let me explain and also correct some misconceptions in your question.The Higgs boson is NOT the smallest particle.  The Higgs boson is one of several particles that are as far as we know fundamental these include  types of quarks  types of neutrinos electrons muons taus  types of gluon and the W and Z bosons.The Higgs boson does not make up everything else nor does it give anything mass.  The Higgs boson is a particle that arises from the existence of something called the Higgs field the default value of the Higgs field throughout space is nonzero and this gives certain things such as electrons mass.  The Higgs bosons are a kind of deviation of the Higgs field away from its default value.String theory is a proposed replacement for particle physics in which the fundamental entities are not little points but little strings.  The different ways the string can oscillate would correspond to the different particles we already know the Higgs boson being one of these as well as electrons photons etc..The Higgs boson is a wellestablished piece of science.

These endotoxins will then meet a macrophage WBC the white blood cell will them release cytokines ILamp and TNFalpha. These create local and systemic inflammation through various cascades involving neutrophil activation leading to chemotaxis as well hypothalamic activation via CNS leading to hormonal release of GH ACTH ADH activation of the sympathetic nervous system and NAA release.  creating an proinflammatory bomb most localised around the site of infection.During the night this process is able to continue relatively uninterrupted. During the day cortisol release spikes notably mineral and glucocorticoids it is the steroid release that palliates the nighttime symptoms. Steroids affect almost every system in the body and are under tight regulation they affect protein fat and sugars metabolism and water and mineral movement. Glucocorticoids in particular affect the immune system. Glucocorticoids inhibited the recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes. They affect the neutrophils ability to promote chemotaxis via  mechanisms. They block both intracellular and endothelial adhesion molecules  and they induce an enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis  ultimately they decrease the synthesis prostaglandin mediators. They can stabilise lysosomes in macrophages reducing endotoxin release and reduce cytokine agent release. All of this reduces the bodies immunological response to infection   of which is what you experience as symptoms of a condition.edit sorry steroid release at night is much lower  therefore proinflammatory processes may advance relatively unopposed  this leads to symptoms plus plus steroid production is higher during the waking hours suppressing symptoms.I am sure pooling of pulmonary fluids whilst lying leading to coughing and difficulty breathing but this does not account for feeling more unwell and this is due to the bodies systemic and local inflammation process.,askscience,ceo17pi,6,t5_2qm4e85000,0,t3_1v1mbk,It is actually the perfect number . it is balances and it stays balances as it spins and blades see different wind speeds.

It is more like a slow moving fluid circuit in hydraulics the individual water molecules dont move very far but a lot of work is done at the end actuator. A common drift velocity in an electric circuit is around mms. Just like in the hydraulic analogy the electrons are bouncing around very fast just like the thermal velocity of the water molecules but they are forced in one general direction or another slowly.The speed that a signal can propagate down a wire is limited by how fast the electrons bounce around. One electron does not pass from one end of the cable to another they jostle each other. This is equivalent to the speed of sound in water a force wave passes through the closely touching water molecules to transmit a signal. ,askscience,cep0kzd,1,t5_2qm4e94744,0,t3_1v6ay0,Everyone has a blind spot in each eye where the optic nerve attaches.

The Bolivian species in particular is  miles away from any estuarine habitats in a straight line ignoring the thousands of extra miles of meanders of the river and trapped in an area of the country that is  m above sea level.All species apart from La Plata are adapted to live in freshwater rivers and not oceanic or brackish waters they can no longer cope with the salt levels for long periods.

When electrons are removed from an atom the most common force acting on it is the electromagnetic force. You seem to have a giant uniform electrostatic field in mind but such a field is no different in principle than light knocking off an electron seeing as light consists of electromagnetic waves. Also when two atoms collide and an electron gets ripped off the collision interaction is really just the electromagnetic force. So whether we are talking about static cling on clothes just out of the dryer salty water lightning the ionosphere or doped computer chips the electrons were ripped of and the ions were created because of the electromagnetic force. Ripping off a few outer electrons is fairly easy. You do it every time you turn on a fluorescent light bulb. Ripping off all the electrons is much harder especially for the heavier elements and therefore requires stronger fields.,askscience,ceqhlpj,2,t5_2qm4e107345,0,t1_cem71cr,deleted,askscience,ceqnig6,1,t5_2qm4e107654,0,t1_ceq2j3u,deleted,askscience,ceqos6i,1,t5_2qm4e107780,0,t1_ceqomwc,deleted,askscience,ceqpaub,21,t5_2qm4e107834,0,t1_ceqp8ba,deleted,askscience,ceqpiu7,1,t5_2qm4e107899,0,t1_ceqkb1x,Theres no restriction on nonidentical particles.Whether theres an approachable derivation of the SpinStatistics Theorem would depend on your background.

It is not exact by any means or even all that close. But rats are cheap to house in large numbers easy to breed and simple to take care of. Legally there are many exceptions for rats and mice that do not apply to animal testing on dogs cats pigs horses and nonhuman primates which are all models used after testing on rats. Since rats are so abundant its not a huge deal if a bunch are killed from whatever testing is done on them. That being said ALL animal testing is first approved by an IRB institutional review board and IACUC institutional animal care and use committee to ensure the most ethical practices. Additionally animals that are used in experiments are kept in a vivarium with inhouse veterinarians that monitor animal health and ensure compliance. I work with rats everyday some of my colleagues use other animals but rats are the best for basic science research. Once an idea is vetted and properly investigated for longterm potential in humans further animal testing in more physiologically similar animals will proceed.

As a result of different aging times different wood used how many times the cask has been refilled conditions in which the cask has been stored etc. this value will be slightly different each time.

The left side of the table tends to hold elements with metallic properties atroom temperature as you shift from left to right you progress through various types of metals towards the nonmetals. Now metals are interesting in that they undergo what is referred to as metallic bonding in which the atoms of the metal are attracted to other atoms of the same metal forming a crystal lattice of sorts. Fun fact the bonding results in decentralized electrons which form an electron sea this electron sea is what permits electrical flow current through a metal. As a result of this bonding the metal species have massive interatomic forces which act on them keeping them in solid form. Essentially to overcome them requires a massive amount of energy. Heat Now when we get into the nonmetals take halogens for example while when cooled they do form crystals for example the brownpurple crystals of iodine these lattice structures are held together much less so as the interatomic forces acting on the atoms is weaker. These crystal structures are much easier to break and often break at room temperature.TLDR Essentially it is not the position on the table which dictates the state but the kind of interatomic forces which the elemental species is subjected to which does. ,askscience,cesu9pi,1,t5_2qm4e127280,0,t1_ceswhst,deleted,askscience,cesxbqe,1,t5_2qm4e127793,0,t1_cesnygk,What about Garborators?

Scientists will very rarely call this zero gravity instead they call it microgravity. But why do they float around if they are feeling almost the same gravity that Im feeling on the surface of Earth? you may be thinking. The reason they are floating is because they are constantly falling towards the center of the Earth but they are moving so fast that they actually miss the planet! I find that amazing. I dont know about you but when I first learned that it blew my mind. And thats exactly what an orbit is constantly falling towards the Earth but missing it so you keep falling. The ISS is moving east at about  miles per hour thats  miles a second. If it wasnt moving at all it would just fall straight down to the Earth. But it moves fast enough that it misses the Earth then it tries to fall to the Earth again and misses again this keeps happening and thats what an orbit is.As for finding a place with absolutely no gravity that isnt possible. Space is not a perfect vacuum so there are little specs of dust and atoms and all kinds of material floating around and all those have gravity. Even if you went outside of the galaxy you would feel the gravity from the Milky Way if you came to a complete stop you would fall back towards it.I had it explained to me this way the only reason everything in space floats is because its constantly falling. The moon is falling around the Earth the Earth around the Sun the Sun around the Milky Way the Milky Way around other galaxies and through space.

I dont have access to the majority of the articles but the abstracts often provide a lot of information Im looking for.Neural correlates of performance variability during motor sequence acquisitionThis paper seems to be more of the basic research type looking at the regions of the brain activated at various stages of motor learning for a task involving the nondominant hand. As learning occurs response in the precuneus decreases whereas the caudate nucleus increases. In the middle  between the initial awkward phase and the learned phase  there is a period of highly variable results that are associated with increased interaction between the hippocampus and frontoparietal areas and between the striatum and frontal areas. Someone is going to have to explain this one to me.Switching handedness fMRI study of hand motor control in righthanders lefthanders and converted lefthandersThis study looked at differences in brain organization between lefthanders righthanders and people who were lefthanded but were forced to switch to righthanded. The long and the short of it is that brain activity associated with motor control of the dominant side in what Ill call cishandedness is typically on the contralateral hemisphere e.g. righthanders use their lefthemisphere. With the nondominant side in cishanded individuals brain activity is more evenly distributed. Activity in transhanded individuals tends to be controlled by both hemispheres and shares features of both right and lefthanders.Dynamic gray matter changes within cortex and striatum after short motor skill training are associated with their increased functional interactionThis study had people learn a task with their nondominant hand. It showed increase of functional coupling between the striatum and cortex over training days. The abstract ends by stating that current data demonstrate traininginduced short GM plasticity is paralleled by their temporally dynamical process of functional interaction between the cortex and the striatum in response to a motor skill training.Effects of Combining  Weeks of Passive Sensory Stimulation with Active Hand Motor Training in Healthy AdultsI like this one. Researchers used electric stimulation on the individuals nondominant hands. Individuals showed substantially improved motor performance of the left hand trained by  but also showed a relevant transfer to the untrained right hand by .Interlimb transfer of ballistic motor skill following nondominant limb training in young and older adultsThis is probably the closest to what I was wondering. They trained righthanders in a lefthanded ballistic motor skill. Both young and old participants showed significant performance improvements in the trained left hand... the extent of interlimb transfer was substantial and indistinguishable between the two age groups... both age groups exhibited bilateral increases in cortical excitability following unilateral training indicating that unilateral training affects both the trained and untrained hemisphere. So it sounds like training with a nondominant hand generates increased activity in both sides of the brain.Brain activation associated with practiced left hand mirror writingAfter training with the nondominant hand researchers saw signal increases in visual right lateral and medial premotor areas and in right anterior and posterior perisylvian areas corresponding to language areas. They suggest that the ability to do lefthanded mirror writing may actually be a latent ability. If thats the case then training lefthanded mirror writing may reduce transhemispheric suppression.So those are all the articles I was able to find. Im left with the impression that training does indeed change brain activity patterns by increasing bilaterality. I would be interested to see longitudinally how long such effects last if the individual doesnt keep in practice and if there is a measurable effect on dominant hand motor control after extensive training. It sounds to me like because the nondominant training transferred to the dominant side you would see an improvement in motor skills overall. I found the degree of limbtransfer to be quite striking and I would be interested if the extent of skill improvement would have been seen in the dominant hand in individuals who ONLY trained on the dominant side. That is is use of the nondominant hand a way to improve acquisition of skills in the dominant side?,askscience,cewjxnx,2,t5_2qm4e159286,0,t1_cewkjz3,deleted,askscience,cewkqjo,1,t5_2qm4e160024,0,t3_1vw6mc,deleted,askscience,cewnrkt,1,t5_2qm4e160037,0,t1_cewn3b2,deleted,askscience,cewnthu,1,t5_2qm4e160071,0,t1_cewkjz3,deleted,askscience,cewnyil,1,t5_2qm4e160816,0,t1_cewp6o6,deleted,askscience,cewr0e3,1,t5_2qm4e161187,0,t3_1vxf6n,deleted,askscience,cewsj3y,1,t5_2qm4e161640,0,t1_cewu8v3,gtfrom your perspective it would seem like you are traveling forward in time faster than usual.

Viruses are tremendously diverse and have a large number of mechanisms to regulate translation. Your question about the energy required to is not hugely relevant because there is usually an excess of it in the cell. Also to address your point of cleavage of polyproteins being less efficient this isnt necessarily true. In fact some viruses such as picornaviruses use internal cleavage signals which automatically fold up on themselves and prevent catalysis of peptide bonds in a very efficient fashion so that two proteins from a polypeptide can be cleaved without any external factors. Mechanisms like these and others like internal ribosomal entry sites ribosomal slippage and promoters of various strengths all play a much larger role in viral fitness than the energy required to produce or cleave proteins.,askscience,ceyc09l,2,t5_2qm4e178848,0,t1_ceynbp6,It is possible but unlikely that we will ever have a correct theory.

In the beginning when the universe was extremely hot we had up and down quarks and many other particles flying around extremely fast. As the quarks were travelling extremely fast they overcame the repulsion of other quarks and came close enough that the strong nuclear force could hold them together as protons and neutrons. And as energy and mass are linked by einsteins equation we have found that the majority of the mass of a proton and neutron is in this bond between the quarks.

Taken together these tendencies could be considered their personality. Individuals of the same species can act consistently differently from each other in some way while acting consistently similar to individuals of another species.As for why interactions seem to fit cleanly into categories thats because interactions between two real animals can fit into categories. When one animal meets another there might be aggression if theyre defending territory mates or young for example there might be avoidance many animals dont actively defend their home range but they avoid conspecifics they may totally ignore the other animal or there may be a social interaction if its a more gregarious species.If an animal cant recognize themselves in the mirror they interact with their reflection similarly to how they would react to a real conspecific. A dog for example could perform any of the interactions depending on its behavioral phenotype. An aggressive territorial dog might bark at its reflection and try to drive the other dog out of its territory. A friendly dog might try to play with its new friend and you see the patty cake interaction. A very submissive dog see the other dog and think its intruding on the other dogs territory and avoid the mirror.,askscience,cf8jiwr,2,t5_2qm4e269322,0,t3_1x6tae,deleted,askscience,cf8obsu,0,t5_2qm4e269552,0,t1_cf8byqp,deleted,askscience,cf8p6nf,1,t5_2qm4e271704,0,t3_1x7kjw,deleted,askscience,cf8x82v,-1,t5_2qm4e272467,0,t3_1x6q3i,deleted,askscience,cf902w6,1,t5_2qm4e272558,0,t3_1x6lsv,To absolutely qualify and quantify the degree of abnormality a cardiopulmonary exercise stress test is used to determine a patients exercise tolerance. It obtains a variety of physiological measures during the testing and compares them to an expected maximum value for that patient. If they score significantly below their expected values then they can be considered to have intolerance. But it is important to recognise that there is a MAX  that is just because you get breathless running a marathon does not indicate early disease. Also important to remember that these are unlikely to be used if you are just short of breath while running  unless its a significant deterioration from previous tolerance.Parameters obtained includesPeak oxygen uptake PkVo The highest Vo achieved during the CPX and generally occurs at or near peak exercise. Reported as a weightadjusted parameter in mLkg per minute. Maximal oxygen uptake Vomax The value achieved when Vo remains stable despite a progressive increase in the intensity of exercise. This is synonymous with peak aerobic capacity. Breathing reserve BR The reserve capacity of the ventilatory system calculated as  minus the ratio of peak exercise minute ventilation Ve to maximal voluntary ventilation. A normal value would be . Anaerobic threshold AT The highest oxygen uptake attained without a sustained increase in blood lactate concentration and lactatepyruvate ratio. Reported as a weightadjusted parameter in mLkg per minute. Respiratory exchange ratio RER Related but not equivalent to its cellular counterpart the respiratory quotient and is defined as the ratio of Vco to Vo. Oxygen saturation SpO The percentage of hemoglobin that is saturated with oxygen. Typically measured by pulse oximetry. O pulse The amount of O consumed from the volume of blood delivered to tissues by each heartbeat is calculated as O pulseVoheart rate. Ventilationcarbon dioxide production ratio VeVco Also known as the ventilatory equivalent for CO this represents a respiratory control function that reflects chemoreceptor sensitivity acidbase balance and ventilatory efficiency. Peak Volean The peak oxygen uptake adjusted for lean body mass.

It is strange that almost all of our orifices appear to be wet while the ear seems to remain dry as a bone...so it seeeeeems!In fact the ear canal does have a number of mucus membranes! The ear consists of three parts the outer ear the visible part the middle ear and the inner ear. The most common mucus youll encounter is ear wax which lubricates the outer and middle ear while blocking pesky bacterium bugs and other nasty things from entering the ear canal. Its theorized that the canal walls dont produce a more liquidy mucus because of the limited space of the ear region doesnt leave much room for glands to produce that sort of stuff. Plus a solid wall would be better for acoustic purposes.Next the tympanic membrane commonly known as the ear drum is a thin membrane located in the middle ear that closes off canal to the outside world outside of the ear yet wiggly enough to vibrate and transmit sound waves to the inner ear. It also protects the ossicles or three tiny bones that transmit the vibrations of the drum to the inner ear via the cochlea a fluidfilled labyrinth that houses the actual auditory sensory organ.In short there is mucus and fluid all over the place in the ears its just deeper and less mucuslike.,askscience,cfamjur,2,t5_2qm4e288356,0,t1_cfan3nu,deleted,askscience,cfanhwr,1,t5_2qm4e289276,0,t1_cfapt4h,What about putting duck legs on a gyrocopter Rc copter landing it in fish eggs and flying it around for a set amount of time and then landing in a secondary pond with no fish eggs. ,askscience,cfaqxv8,184,t5_2qm4e289922,0,t3_1xd8ix,We do the same in the Netherlands.

Specific isotopes of uranium will decay to specific isotopes of lead with a known half life independent of external conditions. Zircon eagerly incorporates uranium into its crystal lattice when forming but excludes lead therefore all lead within a sample must have started life as uranium. This is enough to determine how old a rock is. Since the earth was molten when formed and any subsequent impacts by zircon crystals formed elsewhere would probably have melted the crystals it is safe to assume the crystal formed on earth after the earth began to cool so the earth is at least as old as your rock.

Those electrons are owned by that atom and stick to it as long as nothing comes along that pulls them hard enough to separate them from the atom or strike them loose from the atoms. Molecules like HO are similar to atoms in that there electrons that stay localized around the molecule most of the time.  Metals are different. Instead of sharing electrons with another atom to achieve a stable configuration metal atoms release their electrons and these delocalized not part of a specific bond or atom electrons will spread throughout the metal in a way that is as electrically neutral as possible i.e. no clumps of electrons in one area unless the atoms in that area are really positively charged.  A generator works by creating areas of negative charge or positive charge. By plugging a metal wire into a positively charged object we will draw electrons toward that object. By plugging a metal wire into a negatively charged object the electrons making that object negatively charged will move into our wire and in the process their negative charge will repel other electrons in the wire away.  An AC generator produces alternative positive and negative charges about  times a second. Plugging a wire into this will cause electrons to move back and forth quickly as one end draws then repels them.  In the process the electrons will interact with the inner electrons of metal atoms which do not become delocalized and cause those inner electrons to become momentarily excited before falling back down and producing a photon which we may feel as infrared light see as visible light or not detect if it is any of the other wavelengths generally nothing higher than UV is produced.,askscience,cfelfqk,4,t5_2qm4e326345,0,t1_cfdwaha,Example Plastic carrier bags.

When speeds are slow momentum is roughly pmv and the rate of change of that when mass isnt changing is Fmdvdt  mass times rate change in velocity  ma because acceleration is the rate change in velocity.But more properly speaking momentum is defined as gammamv where gamma  vc  . Again if vltltc then vc is approximately zero and gamma is approximately . But as velocity increases toward the speed of light the change in velocity it can deliver is smaller and smaller and smaller. Essentially if a force increases me one unit of momentum at low speed and a unit of momentum at high speed at low speed it may provide me  unit of velocity.

Parent organisms assuming they had distinguishable mouths would chew food and spit it into the mouths of their young in the early stages of their lives At a point where they couldnt chew their own food.  This can be seen especially with penguins and similar birds.  Because of the fact the interaction was between the likes of a mother and her young mouth feeding turned into a sign of comfort trust and eventually love.As for other cultures kissing can either be interpreted in a plethora of manners.  For example in Europe a peck on the cheek is a polite formal greeting with the same significance as a handshake might be in the United States As an American living in Europe this took a while to get used to.  Other cultures such as the cultures of Japan and China might see such physical contact as taboo.So to sum things up kissing is not solely a human action and was developed as a result of biological means.

The hotter something gets the more radiation it outputs and the more energy that output has. Think of a piece of metal at room temp it isnt glowing in the visible light spectrum but is actually still radiating at lower energy levels infrared if you were to heat it up it would slowly start to glow red visibly. In space some things can get super hot like a collapsing star and have huge energy radiation in Xray energy levels. The corollary to this is that an object also receives radiation from surrounding objects also. So if there are two pieces of metal one is room temp and the other is red hot. The red hot one is giving out more energy than it is gaining from the other one so it is having a net loss of heat or cooling down. The room temp one is receiving more radiation from the red hot metal than it is radiating out itself so it starts to heat up with the gain of energy.,askscience,cfgi5vj,1,t5_2qm4e345649,0,t1_cfgb3f3,Youre misunderstanding what theyre saying.

Weve now know that the effect were seeing is not caused by the structure or geometry of the plasma ball!  So heres my guess as to what is going onThese plasma balls work by applying a voltage difference between the center node and the glass.  The plasma you see is from electrons flowing from the inside to the glass outside.  When you touch the glass you create an ideal path for the electrons to flow.However when the electrons flow through the gas inside it heats up the gas.  That region of hot gas is ideal for electrons to go through since its already ionized.  But we know that hot gas rises!  So what we have is an ideal place for the beam to go your hand and an ideal path along the hot gas.  The problem is that as the gas rises the path length from the center to your hand gets longer and becomes less optimal.  There becomes a point where it becomes easier to forge a new direct beam from the center to your hand.When your hand is on top the rising gas moves along the electron beam!  So there is no disturbance!Thats just my guess as Im not an expert in plasma physics!  This was a great question driven by a keen observation.

This turns out to be important because it means what is and what isnt a vacuum largely depends on what kind of threshold you can tolerate.Water boils easier at lower temperatures pressure because the random thermal motion of the fluid eventually imparts enough kinetic energy that a few molecules break free from the fluid and float off.  Left alone youll eventually end up in an equilibrium where the amount of water being jettisoned off equals the amount that returns back because the molecules are bouncing around and fall back into the liquid state.  This is the vapor pressure   Pa or . atm at  Celsius.If that vapor pressure exceeds your tolerance of what defines a vacuum then an open sample of water would effectively destroy it.  If your tolerance is not one single atom bouncing around then youll never create a vacuum to start with and its a moot point.e Should be mentioned that the vacuum pressure equilibrium depends on you not running the vacuum pump continuously.  If you keep removing molecules from the system it wont stay at that pressure as some of the vapor exits the chamber and disrupts the equilibrium.,askscience,cfikf2i,4,t5_2qm4e364747,0,t1_cfid8u2,Not really related but Im curious Do medications typically need to be combined with HCl when delivered in capsule form?

There are three common types resistive capacitive and acoustic wave.  For the resistive and capacitive versions there are orthogonal grids that run in the vertical and horizontal directions directly beneath the topmost glass layer.  When your skin touches the screen in the resistive system the two overlapping grids come into contact and current is able to pass between them and is detected by the electronics.  In the capacitive system theres a dielectric layer between the surface glass and the grids.  This dielectric layer functions exactly like a capacitor hence the name.  When your finger touches down a small amount of charge passes to your finger and thereby changes the capacitance of the areas outlined by the horizontalvertical grids beneath where you touched.  Those changes are then detected by the electronics yielding a point.  Im glossing over some subtleties here... in reality no charge actually passes into your finger rather an electrical double layer forms from the ions in your skin that offsets the charge from the phones dielectric layer allowing additional charge to pass.  The effect is very small in macroscopic terms but well within the detection limits of the phones electronics.You can out which type you have by trying to touch with something insulating like a piece of plastic e.g. ball point pen or a wooden spoon etc.  If it doesnt work its capacitive.  If it works its resistive.  You might have the acoustic transducer system in either case but those are very expensive and are not very common.So to answer the question... as it turns out drops of water also have metal ions that are ever present in tap water things like calcium Ca and iron Fe.  Rainwater btw also has ions predominantly organic owing to pollution e.g. acid rain sulfuric acid HSO.  These same ions are also present in your skin and all of your bodys cells as they are fundamental to proper cell function.  So whether within your skin or within the water those ions change the capacitance of the dielectric layer.  This is why your phone most likely is of the capacitive variety and should not function touchwise with an insulating material.TLDR both water and skin have elemental and molecular ionic species these ions change the capacitance of the dielectric layer under the touchscreen which is how the touch is identified.,askscience,cfj13x3,4,t5_2qm4e369277,0,t1_cfiz0d9,deleted,askscience,cfj1hlw,0,t5_2qm4e371934,0,t3_1yb3tc,deleted,askscience,cfjbebn,0,t5_2qm4e372641,0,t3_1yagub,HelloAll the points brought up here are really good and spot on.

You find that no matter how dim the beam some electrons are still emitted with a dimmer beam they are emitted less often but the energies of the electrons emitted are distributed in the same way for a dim beam or a bright beam.  This is explicable if the beam is made up of photons.  Each time a photon hits an electron can be emitted with the photon picture we see that the same energy is available at each interaction just that as a beam becomes dimmer or brighter its just that youve got fewer or more photons.

In and of themselves this is relatively trivial to compute hence realisticlooking ragdoll effects.The hard part is what those videos reference as AI. Consider someone pushing you in the chest if its relatively weak you just kind of sway back and get back to equilibrium. If its more forceful youll actually lift a foot and move it behind you to regain balance. The biological guts of this action is an incredibly complex function of your senses and conscious and unconscious decision making  mathematically its highly nonlinear to the point that direct simulation of the process is out of the question.

For example many films use motion capture to animate characters think Avatar or Golum in Lord of the Rings and dont suffer from the uncanny valley unless the characters are also made to look too humanlike think Polar Express. In general procedural animation problems are probably less uncanny valley and more just not realistic if not done correctly.

If youre getting contention when running several jobs at the same time the reason on our system is generally locking for data protection which is unavoidable to a degree if your jobs are updating  writing  deleting. You can still read while these operations are occurring to a degree but if youre trying to access the same object in  different jobs at the same time youre going to have to wait. This isnt necessarily a deadlock situation though..thats just standard locking  blocking. Deadlocking is a different issue though where JobA needs Object  and Object  with a lock on Ob JobB needs Ob amp Ob with a lock on Ob. Our software has some deadlock detection that will abort one of the queries should the deadlock be detected after X minutes but there isnt a real way to avoid this type of contention that I am aware of anyway except for proper job scheduling. ,askscience,cfox6fe,1,t5_2qm4e427141,0,t1_cfnpzyi,From a quick search it seems that the physiological mechanisms of tolerance might be the answer to that chronic arsenic exposure leads to a change in the geneexpression of the exposed cells leading to a higher rate of metabolism.Acute arsenic toxicity stems partly from the similarity of arsenate and phosphate which is used to great extent in transferases and kinases in the metabolic pathways. ,askscience,cfp1e5n,1,t5_2qm4e427878,0,t3_1ywllu,Youre both right there are proofs for both positions.

Some people might think of her from Friends while others might think of her in a movie role with dark hair. Maybe some would think of her with short hair or maybe her nude picture on the cover of that magazine. How do our brains pull up these separate ideas of this same concept?

Thanks. ,askscience,cfyurp1,1,t5_2qm4e517120,0,t3_2005ho,well depends. First nearly all these ideas require a vacuum so you have the attendant issues of pumping vacuum. Now the simplest design is to just build two plates and put them at a potential difference of  kiloVolts. And thats not unreasonable high voltage power lines could easily do  kV. Youd probably have to build a really solid stepup transformer and youd want to rectify the current so that it doesnt alternate from V to V on a plate youd prefer something as close to DC as possible. Alternatively you could use magnetic fields after the plate accelerators to divert any electrons that hadnt been accelerated to  kV so youd just end up with bunches of electrons that were approximately accelerated to the right kinetic energy. The next more complicated design would be to use a magnet and turn the particle around and pass it through the plates multiple times. Maybe you pass it through a  kV separation  times and you get your particle out. Problem here is that when you turn charged particles they emit synchrotron radiation so youre going to lose some energy to that and you also should shield your detector for safety. And since electrons are so light theyre particularly prone to it. But  kV isnt... terribly high so its not as bad as other modern accelerators.Most complicated but probably one of the more efficient ways is to build an RF cavity where standing waves can add up and amplify how much they push the electron during acceleration. Most modern accelerator design just beads together many superconducting RF cavities in a long chain bumping the electron up at each cavity. Also on the horizon is some of the neatest stuff. Plasma wakefield technology is one really super neat technology that uses variations in a plasma to produce one very highly accelerated bunch of electrons out of it. ,askscience,cfz1toy,1,t5_2qm4e518430,0,t1_cfz74bx,Im with you and by no means hate the show.

But not Alzheimers per se as that relates to a specific subtype of dementia but a dementia syndrome that clinically and histopathologically can resemble Alzheimers.For example in the dialysis setting aluminium toxicity is a real and previouslycommon thing from the days of using aluminiumcontaining antacid preparations as phosphate binders. Nowadays calciumbased agents and newer medications are used instead. Additionally improved filtering of the dialysate has all but eliminated aluminium toxicity in that population.However aluminium in high doses does cause acute neurotoxicity and so called dialysis dementia was thought to be aluminiumrelated. Of course dementia in dialysis patients is confounded by multiple common risk factors.However there is a marked difference between a dialysis patient on highdoses of aluminium for a longtime and drawing broad conclusions as some propose about the safety of aluminium as a cooking material water container etc.Suffice to say that I would have no concerns about aluminium cookware and the like and that doses of other toxins in day to day life would far exceed that piddly exposure.

First your innate immune cells have things called PRRs pattern recognition receptors that are able to detect PAMPs pathogenassociated molecular patterns. PAMPs are structures that are found in many pathogens and that are essential and highly conserved i.e. unlikely to change in the pathogen. Second there are different places in your body where your adaptive immune system screens for foreign antigens. An antigen is literally anything that is antibody generating hence antigen. This is accomplished through the use of immunoglobulin Ig molecules which is a family of molecule that antibodies belongs to. Your body theoretically has Igs that target every foreign antigen. About your second question this mechanism is kind of counterintuitive. You can also think of why your body doesnt attack the food you eat because it is mostly foreign too. In your gut immune cells are bathed in immunorepresive molecules so its harder to accidentally activate them. In addition to this for an immune cell to be activated by an antigen in the gut there has to be not too much of it. It sounds odd but when a pathogen infects you there really isnt a lot of it compared to the amount of YOU there is therefore your body knows to attack it. On the other hand when you eat a meal there is so much antigen food that your body doesnt attack it in fact your body will start to be desensitized to it killing off immune cells that are reactive to the food. For good bacteria it is a combination of numbers having grown up with them the bacteria staying away from immune cells not crossing your intestine wall and the bacteria not doing anything harmful.,askscience,cg38ikc,3,t5_2qm4e554604,0,t3_20h0kz,deleted,askscience,cg3bct8,1,t5_2qm4e555208,0,t3_20h2in,deleted,askscience,cg3dtnm,1,t5_2qm4e556128,0,t1_cg3ffuw,You can get a reasonable feel for the scale here with estimates...Volume of Milky Way.

AFAIK Dark matter is matter that do not react with anything except through gravity its like a very thin fog or ether that we move through is this correct?Earth would never turn into a black hole as the electromagnetic forces acting upon the atoms of Earth are far stronger than gravity. The internal pressure of the planet can easily hold against gravity. Only when you have large enough masses does gravity overtake the electromagnetic forces and the mass collapses into a singularity hence all black holes comes from very large stars. If normal matter were not hold apart like this I assume all accumulations of matter would collapse to small black holes instead of planets suns etc. as nothing would stop it collapsing in on itself there is no internal pressure so all matter just falls into the centre of gravity and  creates a singularity no matter how small mass. Everything would be black holes of varying masses. the sun wold be a big black hole with  smaller black holes in orbit plus millions if not more tiny black holes from the asteroid belt Oorths cloud etc.What is it that stops dark matter using the gravity of a planet or just a local higher  density of dark matter as a seed to build up and create a black hole and as its not hold apart by the electromagnetic forces?I assume there must be something that stops this form happening?,askscience,cg6dkag,1,t5_2qm4e581732,0,t1_cg6det5,I always thought the same thing but its been so drilled into my head I figured it must be true...Though I would imagine that having a strong secondary gravity well would certainly help expel smaller bodies.

This entire process causes the heart rate to increase to compensate and keep blood flowing fast enough for adequate circulation and respiration. Increased heart rate from a drug isnt going to have the system wide effects of exercise so the increase in heart rate and blood pressure isnt being compensated by the physical effects of exercise.

Air only travels in one direction through the lungs yes. It moves in both directions in the trachea.Mammals have what is called tidal breathing. When we breathe in we pull air into our lungs. It travels into the trachea and then successively forking bronchi. These end in structures called alveolar sacs which are made up of a cluster of alveoli. Each alveolus the singular of alveoli is covered in blood vessels carrying deoxygenated blood. Oxygen from the air we inhale diffuses over a semipermeable membrane as long as there is more oxygen in the air than in the blood. Meanwhile carbon dioxide is diffusing the other way. Then we exhale our deoxygenated air rinse and repeat. In archosaur lungs rather than have these terminal alveolar sacs they have structures called parabronchi. These are tubeshaped rather than little culdesacs. Having these tubes means that oxygen can diffuse over that semipermeable membrane for longer. The deoxygenated blood is flowing in the opposite direction of the air so the least oxygenated blood encounters the least oxygenated air first. In other words the deoxygenated blood is flowing into the lungs where the deoxygenated air is leaving it. This means that the air still has a higher oxygen level than the blood so diffusion occurs. Towards the point where the air enters the parabronchi both the blood and air again flowing in opposite directions are at their most oxygenated but diffusion still occurs because theres slightly more oxygen in the blood. This maximizes the amount of oxygen that can be pulled from the air and its a wonderful example of countercurrent exchange Its part of what makes this system so efficient.To be able to have this unidirectional airflow requires some anatomical finagling. Air is moved through the lungs using sets of anterior and posterior air sacs with the sacs acting as bellows. The trachea does connect to the lungs and to the air sacs via the main bronchi which are what the trachea forks into to get to each lung. Different oneway valves close off within the bronchi depending on which direction the air is going.Your breakdown is close although you skipped the second inhalation. So its Inhale  air enters the trachea and moves into posterior air sacs.  Exhale  air moves from posterior air sacs into the lungs.  Inhale  air moves from the lungs into the anterior air sacs.  Exhale  air moves from the anterior air sacs out through the trachea.Thats how one breath of air moves through the lungs. Except in reality Inhale  and  are both going on at the same time as are Exhale  and . Otherwise they wouldnt be bringing in any air on the second inhale which doesnt make sense. In a diagram like this youre seeing the steps occurring simultaneously. So in reality its more like this On inhalation air is pulled down the trachea into the main bronchi and into the posterior air sacs. Air also goes from the lungs and therefore parabronchi and into the anterior air sacs.  On exhalation air from the posterior sacs is pushed through the lungs and air from the anterior sacs is pushed out into the trachea and exhaled. This means that air is always moving through the lungs and gas exchange is occurring on both inhalation and exhalation. Thats another part of what makes this system so efficient.,askscience,cg9migq,3,t5_2qm4e610914,0,t1_cg9pgxm,deleted,askscience,cg9porp,17,t5_2qm4e611404,0,t1_cg9p2e7,deleted,askscience,cg9rouo,1,t5_2qm4e611695,0,t1_cg9sblb,deleted,askscience,cg9svm1,1,t5_2qm4e613567,0,t3_215cm2,deleted,askscience,cga0ith,1,t5_2qm4e614676,0,t1_cga2u3q,deleted,askscience,cga51wf,1,t5_2qm4e614844,0,t1_cga5koc,deleted,askscience,cga5qmj,1,t5_2qm4e616790,0,t1_cgadcxp,deleted,askscience,cgadp3z,1,t5_2qm4e617358,0,t1_cga8q3e,There are lots of stars in both galaxies but theyre very far away from each other.

Blood group antibodies are either naturally occurring or immune stimulated.  AntiA and antiB the antibodies against A and B antigens fall into the naturally occurring category.  Oligosaccharides found in the environment share the same structure as these A and B antigens so people who are exposed to these plantbased oligosaccharides which includes everybody will form these antibodies depending on their own blood type.  People who are type A wont form antiA as it would destroy their own cells but they do form antiB.  The opposite is true for type B people and type O people will form both antiA and antiB.  This happens regardless of transfusion status.Its the presence of these naturally occurring antiAantiB that allow for reverse typing of cells.  In a forward type the patients cells are added to solutions of antiA antiB and antiD.  Agglutination with these sera indicate the presence of those antigens.  In a reverse type the patients serum or plasma is added to A cells and B cells.  Someone with type A will show no reaction with the A cells the same youd see in a compatible crossmatch and will agglutinate with the B cells due to the presence of naturally occurring antiB.  Most standard blood typing will include both the forward and reverse type except when typing cord blood cells from a newborn.  Why?

The energy of the wind is translated into surface waves and storms usually involve high winds making for choppy seas.  As these waves interact they can grow together especially if they happen to be travelling in the same direction.Other ways to create waves in open water are large differences in air pressure  higher atmospheric pressure that usually accompanies clear skies literally depresses the water.  As storm fronts roll in with their lower air pressures there is a pressure differential that rolls in and can appear as waves.  These can become very large because they are less likely to be chaotic like the waves from high winds and are all moving in the same direction.  Over time if their directions are right and they interact with other waves they can become rogue waves.  The surface energy of the wave has to be dissipated through dispersion or by encountering fixed objects near or around the surface such as shoals continental shelves islands and shorelines.,askscience,cgc1b3h,2,t5_2qm4e631405,0,t3_21ca21,Lightning leaves a very specific trait in the rocks in that it fuses silica largely along the surface of the stone while metamorphic rocks are more uniform throughout.

No matter how fast you travel the speed of light you measure is the same.It behaves fundamentally different from the ball you throw inside a train. If youre standing inside the train and you throw the ball forward the ball has some minor speed for you  the speed you threw if forward.  But if youre standing outside of the train seeing it flying by the speed of the ball would be huge The speed of the train PLUS the speed of the throw.This is not the case with light. If you turn on a flashlight while standing inside of the train and you measure the speed of the light you measure the same as someone standing outside the train for your light measures that you emit off your flashlight. This was figured out by experiment.This leads to a formula that shows that velocities are not really additive so you cant simply add them. In most cases you get a good enough estimate though. In this case you simply use the classical non relativistic laws of physics where the speed of the ball seen from outside the train v is simply the speed of the train V plus the speed of the throw vv  V  vBut when you increase velocities this formula is not correct anymore i.e. does not give a good estimate. The formula actually looks like thisv      Vvc   VvNow as you increase the velocity of the train this formula gets farther and father away from just simply V  v until you reach something that is very uncomfortable.

This is limited by the carrier mobility. You can increase the average carrier mobility by increasing the electric field eg by increasing the voltage whilst collisions between electrons or holes and dopants or defects in the transistor channel reduce the mobility. Imagine driving down the road with the accelerator at maximum but colliding with a lamp post and coming to a stop every few metres before starting to accelerate again.Increasing the electric field is what then leads to excessive heat due to leakage of electrons ie the transistor is actually carrying a current even though it is registering a logical . So the other things you can do are make the device smaller or reduce the number of dopants. Making the device smaller works up to a point but below a certain scale the gains are offset. In previous generation chips the oxide layer between the gate and the transistor channel was so thin that there was a significant leakage problem even at low voltage. That is why a new architecture FinFETTrigate was introduced for current generation devices. It allows a higher field with less leakage. So the other thing you can do is reduce the number of collisions. The dopants are there in a semiconductor to generate free electrons or holes in the first place so in standard silicon this is difficult. But there are some other things you can do. For instance High Elecron Mobility Transistors rely on the excess electrons created at the interface between two semiconductors with different bandgaps eg GaAs and AlGaAs. Because there is no dopant in the area where the electrons travel you can treat these electrons as quasi ballistic. Thus the electrons travel with few or no scattering events. These have shown switching frequencies up to almost  THz.Beyond this there is research in to fully ballistic transport of electrons. This could be either  or D quantum objects eg silicon nanowires graphene or superconductors actually ballistic transport and superconducting transport are different but for the sake of this argument they have the same noscattering property. Transistors have been made from all of these including superconducting  note that these dont necessarily rely on suppressing the superconduction to switch but for instance on coupling the cooper pairs from one superconducting film into a second or not but thus far these truly ballistic devices are still at the early stages  frequencies are up to low s GHz although simulations suggest graphene for instance might be capable well into the low THz.   ,askscience,cgi406e,1,t5_2qm4e686451,0,t1_cgia73m,deleted,askscience,cgiaub4,3,t5_2qm4e687746,0,t1_cgiftsc,gt Japanese Yes it is.Nihongo the Japanese word for well Japanese is absolutley an independent and fully comprehensive language.Youre correct about Chinese though which is a label provided to a handful of China based languages e.g. Mandarin.,askscience,cgig5dy,8,t5_2qm4e688038,0,t1_cgicp0s,deleted,askscience,cgihccw,1,t5_2qm4e688198,0,t1_cgihpfe,deleted,askscience,cgihzxs,1,t5_2qm4e688626,0,t1_cgie2gq,deleted,askscience,cgijqyo,1,t5_2qm4e690137,0,t1_cgipl40,Basically yes.

We specifically send traffic to Comcast Business customers over Comcast and traffic to Road Runner customers over Time Warner.It will work if you have to change networking providers. This is call peering and all the providers have agreements with each other on how much they charge each other to pass traffic between themselves. Generally tho this peering connection will be slower and add latency to the end to end transmission. ,askscience,cgipy6o,1,t5_2qm4e693127,0,t3_223aat,Well according to that researchers unpublished notyetpeerreviewed research yes.Without the study its difficult to comment but theres a few things we do know. They do not have a mechanism.  They propose wear and tear but thats just a obvious hypothesis they dont really know why it happens.  This is an important step in establishing causality. Which brings me to...  They do not know its causal.  That is they see an association with running a lot and shorter lifespan but they dont know if its the running thats doing it. For example maybe runners are more likely to be hit by cars and therefore their lives are shortened but not really because of the running.  Although establishing correlation is an important first step in research and sometimes its the best you can do without experimenting on people its not as definitive as causation. I havent seen but assume they have numbers on how impactful the running is.  They say up to hrsweek is beneficial but they dont tell me if running up to  hours a week is still ok or only slightly bad.  Another interesting question is how much do you have to run to make it so its as bad as being sedentary... I suspect a lot.  In other words youre probably better off running too much rather than too little.Its really important to keep these things in perspective.  We all know drinking is bad for us but many of us do it anyway. If you love running a lot you might as well keep doing it until theres bettermore evidence that its harmful and even then you might want to do it anyway.  If you run solely for heath reasons and you run gt hoursweek you might want to cut back andor replace it with a different type of exercise. ,askscience,cgj26wg,14,t5_2qm4e694549,0,t3_223psk,deleted,askscience,cgj80cs,1,t5_2qm4e694932,0,t1_cgiszh5,haha wow I didnt know that.

In this model light always travels in a straight path and if its location is deep within the well from an outside perspective its path appears to curve around the central object. Note that in the case of black holes the downward slope of the well would approach vertical as the event horizon is approached.Depending on how the light enters this region it may or may not make it back out.

This is true for all objects and distances.Your second question whether the sun weakens the Earths gravitational pull on the day side or not can be answered solely with no but its a bit more complicated than that. The sun itself doesnt weaken the Earths gravitational pull however you an object on the sunny side may feel as if youre less attracted to the Earth. This is because even though youre feeling the same pull from the Earth no matter what side of it youre on youll be feeling an opposing pull from the sun on the day side which makes you overall feel a net lesser pull on one side versus the other.Forces obey something called the superposition principle which means that the force you feel is the sum of all of the forces acting on you. Just because you feel less attracted to something doesnt mean you are less attracted to itindeed there may just be an opposing force that youre not considering.And in practice the differences in r are so small compared to the other scales involved its more or less a moot point for everyday experience.

This is an amazing coincidence that makes Einsteins argument possible. The same is not true for electric or any other kind of charge.Mathematically if you write down F  ma the m there is the inertial mass.

In general if we allow any directrix then a parabola is given by the equation     P  A x  B xy  C y  Dx  Ey  F       satisfying the equation  B AC    moreover we require it to not be a union of two lines.This means that there are only finitely many parabolas passing through any four given points. The condition for existence of such a parabola is that none of the four points is contained inside the triangle formed by the other three. In general there will be exactly two parabolas going through such four points because the condition  B AC    is quadratic and this makes sense given that parabolas intersect in up to  points by Bezouts theorem but there might be only one a multiplicity  situation.    Hence four points with no one point contained in the triangle formed by the other three determine one or two parabolas. You can thus pick three noncollinear points and let the fourth vary to get infinitely many distinct parabolas going through three points.,askscience,cglmn50,4,t5_2qm4e716178,0,t1_cgloi94,gtIf I were at home I could give you the references if you are interested.Id love to see them if you would revisit this post later!Now you said at the site of the cut there would be a tumor.

If you had a car with big or heavy wheels relative to the car then absolutely you must consider the energy int he wheels to have a complete survey of the energy in a car. You also have to remember that the wheels are both rotating and translating so the mass of the wheels has to be accounted for in the calculation of translational energy.The energy can be calculated but not at a highschool level. You need to use moments of force like torque but not quite which you learn in first year statics moments of inertia like translational inertia but with spinning and angular velocity which you may or may not have covered. In the simplest terms a moment is the rotational force around an axis. It can be found by multiplying the applied force by the distance to the axis of rotation  Nm  lbft . ltalso where the principle of leverage come fromTo answer that question with your background would take a few full length lectures to bring you up to speed.

This means that they are composed of various frequencies both visible and invisible. The part of the frequencies that are visible is the visible spectrum with each frequency corresponding to one colour of the rainbow. Higher frequencies are closer to violet and lower frequencies are closer to red.To understand rainbows you need first to understand  phenomena reflection and refraction.When light generally crosses from one material to the next  things happen. . some portion of the energy is reflected . some portion of the energy is refracted crossing into the second material but generally altering its direction.Refraction You ever seen a piece of straw in a glass of water? It appears broken when in fact its not. This is refraction at work. There is such a thing called a refractive index and it is a property of every material. If light comes from a material of refractive index n to a material with a refractive index n with n ! n it will undergo refraction. It will change direction and then continue a new straight course. The angle of the new ray can be computed as follows Lets say that there is a line normal to the boundary plane of the two materials. If the ray out of the drop has a  angle with that line and the ray inside the drop has an angle of  with that same line then sinn  sinn gt arcnsinnbut n changes with frequency so every colour of the rainbow is refracted with a different angle within a raindrop making the single white ray spread out into its constituents. This is why you see that phenomenon depicted in the cover of dark side of the moon. The raindrop sort of acts like the prism in that setup.Reflection You ever noticed how you can only see the rainbow when the sun it as your back and the rain is at the front? but since the light is at your back how can there be something illuminating in front of you? is the rain magically emitting energy? no there is reflection at work. When the light inside a raindrop tries to get out of it some of it is indeed refracted and exits the raindrop but some of it is reflected back. since rays of different frequency reach the surface of the back of the drop with a different angle they again are reflected with a different angle.For brevitys sake lets also only say that again light undergoes a second refractionreflection when it finally comes out of the raindrop and ending up in your eyes.To summarize for a ray that belongs to rainbow to reach your eyes what it does is this. It travels from the sun in a straight line it is refracted in a raindrop it is reflected in its back surface and then refracted again coming out of it.Every frequency has a specific geometry required to reach your eyes it requires to attack the raindrops in a certain angle. If you sit down and draw this youll notice that there are several raindrops with the correct angle for every frequency and these are all in an arc. So basically the higher frequencies are refracted more and the lower frequencies are refracted less. But the family of raindrops that have the correct angle for a given frequency of light is in the form of the arc of that rainbow. White light contains all the frequencies of the visible spectrum and more there is an invisible rainbow underneath and below it made out of infrared and ultraviolet rays above and beneath it. But since there is a band of frequencies you can see there is a band of frequencies reflected back to you each from its appropriate family of raindrops. Therefore you see a band of arcs each with each own frequency.I hope I was clear the concept is difficult to explain without some kind of board. Try to find pictures.

It has been proven that the halting problem cannot be checked by a turing maching And modern day computers are as powerful as turing machinesThere exist some tools for program verification but they normally only result in logic formulas that then can be checked by SAT or other logic solvers Which in itself is a NPhard problem.

Theres a population of thousands using various strategies to improve on the metrics of interest and youre suggesting we should ignore them because they arent in a laboratory setting? Do you think the ceiling is higher than what they can achieve? The only question is to what extent those numbers are higher than they should be given theres probably a proportion of those populations slipping past the PED screenings but they cant be much higher than the natural ceiling.

The difference you speak of is more to do with independence of the single cell that allows it to survive outside of a network of cells. Each cell be it a bacteria or a human skin cell requires nutrients for its survival. In a multicellular organism the cells work in unison to form networks that allow them to support each other and provide nutrients eg. through vascular networks. Bacteria can only survive as long as they have access to their nutrient of choice. Human cells can too survive outside of the body if given the correct medium and supply of nutrients this is commonly done in scientific labs in order to test properties of human or animal cells under various conditions.Bacteria are often able to survive longer outside a body due to their more simplistic requirement of nutrients some bacteria dont even require oxygen!. Indeed their DNA RNA and proteins are quite different from that of animals and plants. Finally the brain you refer to exists in animal plant and bacterial cells and is known as the nucleus. The nucleus contains DNA which is transcribed into RNA that is translated  finally into proteins. Both proteins and also small RNA molecules are responsible for driving the complex events of metabolism movement and cell division reproduction. Additionally in a chicken and egg sort of situation RNA and proteins are what controls DNA transcription in the nucleus and translation of proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum.

The latter question is relevant beyond just can they say that they remember everything because the mind will seamlessly and unconsciously fill in gaps in memory perception etc. This is why people with dementia will make up things that never happened  their brain uses whatever memory is available then fills in the gaps as best it can. There is also the question about the level of detail  do these people remember exactly how many steps they took walking to the bathroom each morning? How many strokes they made shaving face legs whatever? When you dig deeper the actual people you are likely to run into wont be able to recall that level of detail at least not accurately and there is often no objective source of information at that level of detail.

And that the current status of that derivation is that with the parameters of our universe as they are now metric expansion simply doesnt happen on those scales. OPs question like the many others of the same results in this separated picture people have in their mind. That the universe is expanding and that forces including gravitation exist as two separate phenomena. And thats the picture thats inaccurate on both a scientific and pedagogical level. Where there is gravitation there is not metric expansion. You cant have two separate solutions to the EFEs that apply in one region. The behaviour of spacetime in our area here is overwhelmingly gravitational in nature not expansive. So what it means for space to expand is that there exist regions of space where the mass density ltlt dark energy density and the EFE solution in these regions is one of metric expansion and not gravitation. There probably is some region where the length scales put dark energy density on the order of mass density and then the EFE solution is just a mess.

This is not the s when classification systems were all stuck in books and manuals. We have this amazing thing called the internet. Some groups are taking full advantage of the web by making xml and csv files and search features part of their websites and allowing anyone to use their classification systems freely.  Last I checked those WHO publications were proprietary required an agreement to access and are even harder to share.  There are amazing online classification systems being used today that anyone can access and use.  IRAC has done a great job making it easy to classify pesticides  and see just how many pesticides german cochroaches resist  And ITIS has done a great job showing how those cockroaches are related to  different species on the planet. And that list grows each month. And those ITIS lists links to all kinds of resources so people can find out if a species is endangered or not and how many are estimated to still be around and where do they live. And anyone anywhere on the planet can use these lists for free without having to create a user name or having to sign a form because they are mean to be used and shared. And these lists are logical and taxonomically correct with no duplication and everything is being counted and nothing is being ignored.  So yes there are lists in oncology but they do not compare favorably to the lists being used in biology and chemistry today.   I have to disagree with you on the microscope comment. We are dealing with same conditions when they look the same under the microscope at least at the tissue level.  If the cells on a slide are invading nearby tissue and they look like smooth muscle it is a leiomyosarcoma. It does not matter if they formed in the uterus or in the vas deferens they are all leiomyosarcomas.  That is not enough to tell whether or not they will respond to treatment e.g. doxorubicin.  That takes more than a microscope. But it is enough to say that these are the same conditions at the tissue level and should not be treated as if they were carcinomas. ,askscience,ch2kr1h,1,t5_2qm4e864760,0,t3_2417pk,Thank you for your submission!

Think of it like a th grade biology experiment.  You grow  trees.  Once they are of the proposed space travel size say a year or two you subject them to wild swings between F and F.  They all die of course.So you try again.  Another  trees.  Another sequence of temperature swings.  Another immediate dieoff.Youre hoping for a random mutation that will magically make one of those trees resistant to the Martian environmental conditions.  Theres probably a whole collection of mutations that would have to occur at the same time in the same organism by complete chance to even get close to having one potentially viable tree.  But it happens to express some other mutation that prevents it from surviving the second season or perhaps from reproducing.  Back to the drawing board.Gene splicing and recombining with genetic material from other organisms that have the desired traits would probably be a path worth pursuing.  For example identify the genes that result in antifreeze properties in some arctic plants and try to introduce those in some way that gives your Mars tree similar properties.

The best answer I can give is that these mutations are extremely rare. As hox genes are so important there are probably only a couple of DNA sequence changes that can be tolerated. Another thing to mention is that in lobsters and shrimp the duplications happen in small segments with few internal organs that are already quite numerous. It seems likely to me that adding an extra pair of swimmerets would be much less deleterious than adding an extra digestive system or other crucial organs. Insects have really important organs in all  of their segments so perhaps duplicating any of these creates a system that is too out of balance to survive just a hypothesis!Another factor to take into account is that we still estimate that there are millions of insect species still uncharacterised. Until we really know them all the possibility of species with duplicated segments is still posssible ,askscience,ch8jfd2,2,t5_2qm4e917639,0,t1_ch8kycd,This Wikipedia page goes more into depth of the model of a photons particleness based on its wave nature.Its important to remember that a photon is a packet of waves which summed up behave as a particle when viewed from a distance.

So Adenosine TriPhosphate ATP is the energy within the cell. Consider it the fuel. When it gets used it is attached to a protein for instance an enzyme and has high energy. This alters the protein usually changing its shape andor function to make it active. The enzyme will do whatever its function is and the ATP is converted to ADP DiPhosphate which has less energy. Consider ADP the CO emitted from a car exhaust after the fuel has been burned.Now in the case of the cytoskeleton there are proteins which can attach to and walk along actin andor microtubules. These proteins literally look like a pair of legs and are called motor proteins. For these motor proteins an ATP molecule will bind and they will quite literally take one step forwards along the actin filament or microtubule. Then ADP gets released and another ATP molecule needs to bind for the next step to be taken. And where the pelvis would be on the motor proteins is a docking site for cargo. This can attach all sorts of things such as fixing proteins I mentioned in the other comment or organelles as the redditor above mentioned and shuttle them to a particular site. ,askscience,chaf7it,1,t5_2qm4e934428,0,t1_chagwfl,With difficulty as were sexual multicellular organisms.

I suspect no one has scientifically looked at whether this is convergent evolution or a single origin but the relative paucity of nonmammal species for which yawning has been observed suggests that different animals evolved it independently just my guessAs for the second part of your question the first thing to address is whether or not their are any nonvertebrates that yawn.

As soon as cytosin reacts to uracil theres a mismatching base pair of UG instead of UA or CG. The cell has repair mechanisms for taking care of these kinds of problems. Now if the genetic code of the DNA was made up of AUGC and not ATGC as is the case in RNA the repairing proteins have no idea if the Uracil or the Guanin in the mismatched UG base pair was originally there so all they have left is picking them at random. This is of course problematic because of how many proteins would be left dysfunctional by chance as changing one base can have a lot of consequences for the proteins integrity  let alone being confronted with a lot of those punctual mutations at once. However since DNA does only encode via ATGC there should be no reason for Uracil to be there at all so repairing proteins only have to excise Uracil and replace it with Cytosin. So Id say thats also one major factor as to why DNA with ATGC is a lot more reliable in storing information.,askscience,chc1vq7,11,t5_2qm4e948286,0,t1_chc1wnj,gtDoes it rotate so slowly because its correcting and going back to a regular rotation?Theres no regular rotation angular momentum is conserved.  Planets rotate the way they do because the mass from which they were constructed ie protoplanetary disk around the sun had angular momentum X when the material collapsed the momentum was preserved and the planet kept rotating.  The impactor theory relating to Venuss rotation is similar  Venus had angular momentum of X then it was struck by an object that transferred angular momentum to it of Xw.

Well if there are so many dipoles that the system is spherically symmetric you end up getting no multipole moments whatsoever much less a monopole moment.Theres two ways of showing that this configuration produces no outside BfieldThe first way is to use Maxwells equations specifically that the surface integral of the Bfield over any closed surface is .  The system is spherically symmetric so the Bfield can only have a radial component.  Take your surface to be a sphere concentric with the dipole sphere.  Well the surface integral is  but the entire system is spherically symmetric so the net Bfield must be  everywhere.  That explanation is a bit mathy and not very intuitive.  An easier but technically incorrect due to fundamental differences between electric and magnetic dipoles way to think about it is to think about doing the same thing with electric dipoles.  If you do this with electric dipoles you get a spherical shell with total charge Q just outside another shell with total charge Q and the distance between the two shells is negligible.  So inside and outside the concentric shells you get no net field.EDIT Food for thought check out diracs monopole,askscience,chh5hft,4,t5_2qm4e993500,0,t1_chh7fhr,Youre right.

No energy could be harvested if the tides stopped.Rather the goal would be to maximize tidal drag. If the tides could flow unimpeded they would not slow earths rotation. By adding additional drag we would increase the rotational deceleration.But yeah.

As you correctly pointed out hot air rises to the ceiling of a room while cool air sinks to the ground.

There was certainly some protoeukaryal ancestor that eventually branched off to become the animal and plant lineages. Looking at the extant eukaryotic phyla there are the common ones we typically think of plants animals and fungi but alongside these are a very large number phyla which we cant easily place in the Eukaryotic phylogeny. They are usually placed into an ill defined phylogentic bucket labelled the protists.Protists are often unicellular and they may or may not photosynthesis. Some like algae can range from unicellular species all the way to obligate and fully multicellular organisms. Its somewhat accepted that something protistlike would be a good candidate for the protoeukaryal ancestor. So algae fungi and the many and assorted branches of protist phyla are all good examples of other life forms which also branched off from the protoeukaryal other than plants and animals,askscience,chhn9vb,15,t5_2qm4e997596,0,t3_25f0ok,deleted,askscience,chhoms7,1,t5_2qm4e998293,0,t1_chhqs7m,Thanks.

Circadian rhythms control sleepwake cycles in our bodies and after enough rest our bodies begin to return to an active state. This active state involves many different processes such as an increase in HR and respiration the circulatory system due to HR begins to increase in activity various hormones are released which help us wake up and signal to other organs organs start working at an increased level and most importantly your brain starts producing different brain waves. While you are in deep sleep you experience delta waves which have long wavelengths and move slowly leading to a relaxed slumber. When you start to wake up your brain produces alpha and beta waves which have short wavelengths and move faster during the day you are mainly experiencing alpha and beta waves.HOWEVER if you are suddenly woken up by an alarm clock earlier than normal your body most likely will not have been prepared for awakening and thus must complete all the processes I have listed above which can lead to grogginess or the still asleep feeling. Thus its a multitude of processes which are going on even before we start to wake up. Most of these processes involve raising BP HR respiration and organ function as when we wake we will need to utilize all of these. An alarm clock may not give your body enough time to drift out of sleep naturally leading to some processes having to be completed as we get out of bed. Good news most of these processes can happen fairly quickly so the pace between awakening naturally versus alarm clock wakening if timing from the moment a process starts to end will be similar.,askscience,chiagh3,2,t5_2qm4e1003289,0,t1_chhwcnq,The statement that the Earth revolves around the sun isnt falsifiable either because you can obviously do physics perfectly fine if inconveniently in any frame you choose.

A few days ago there was quite an active thread. You can read it hereI think my toplevel comment summarizes what they are and what damage they do as well as well as how touching on their frequency.Since everyone asks for different specifics to answer your post specifically brieflyIt is true a sufficiently powerful flare can damage power infrastructure but sufficiently powerful isnt that well defined certainly the most powerful ever observed flare would cause extensive damage fairly powerful recent geomagnetic storms have already caused damaged halloween storm bastille day event march .Such damage could absolutely take years to repair. Transformers are not particularly interchangeable each is different. They and replacement parts are not stockpiled. Not many companies can make them. All of this could lead to a long period of problems. I doubt the country would be without power for a very long time there are smart people that would work on getting some kind of system back in place and it is unlikely the entire network would be destroyed.gtHow common are solar flares of the this magnitude?The strongest ever solar flare the Carrington event is estimated at a once every  year or so event.gt What new technology or change to the grid is necessary to prevent grid failureI must have typed this a few dozen times on reddit but...nothing drastic we need to improve our forecasting for flares  CMEs as well as improve our modelling of CMEs and their effect on the magnetosphere. We also need to improve our modelling on how space weather affects our electrical infrastructure. We need to recognize that this is a risk and we can gradually tweak the grid using existing technologies after we know where risks are and what changes can prevent them we do not need superconductors or any advanced technology. ,askscience,chmshn9,2,t5_2qm4e1044077,0,t3_2628qx,deleted,askscience,chmyskd,1,t5_2qm4e1044096,0,t3_261hpv,It can have a huge effect in some small ways.

This causes problems in the immediate area in the form of chemicals and the pollution of city life working its way into the little ground there is.

Temperature is the average amount of kinetic energy each molecule of the sample you are measuring has. These amounts will likely be different for each atom and will also be constantly changing as molecules collide and transfer energy to each other. This explains why water will evaporate in notboiling conditions some molecules with above average kinetic energy will have enough energy to overcome the intermolecular bonds and vaporise.So the boiling point of a substance is essentially when the average kinetic energy of each molecule in a substance has enough kinetic energy to overcome IM bonds. But of course by the time a sample reaches this specific temperature many of the molecules will already have evaporated.TLDR temperature is only the average kinetic energy lots of molecules will have enough energy to evaporate before the liquid reaches its boiling point.

You can read more in depth about it here.Secondly its not entirely clear to my knowledge that the rings are maintained in the sense of a single physical entity.

For example if s    s then   . You cant give these series values then expect all the rules of arithmetic to work. The real reason we feel comfortable assigning values to certain divergent series is based on a property of complex functions called analytic extension. Some complex functions have a series form in some region of their domain that diverges in a different region. However they can sometimes be defined to extend uniquely to other the domain of divergence and one could say that that extension assigns a value to the divergent sum. This has the advantage of being uniquely defined.Both sums you proposed happen to formally represent values of the Riemann zeta functionZs  sum nsZ has a pole at s  . There is no way to define sum n to converge. However it extends analytically to the rest of the complex plane including the negative numbers. Thats where we get the identitiesZ  sum   Z  sum n  Now we can also evaluate these sums with arithmetic if we carefully restrict the allowed operations. Thens            ...  s  s          ...    ss  s  edit Im not actually sure what the allowed operations are but you should at least be able to add and subtract like terms of two sequences to obtain a third sequence or multiple all terms by some constant since this can be translated to a statement about formal series.

The direction of the current is such that its magnetic field opposes the change in magnetic flux so the magnetic field created by the current is in the opposite direction as the magnetic field in front of the magnet Lenzs Law.

Figure  shows left ventricular hypertrophy in a female patient with Fabry disease exemplifying that high penetrance of the disease is possible in heterozygotes. This is largely due to random Xchromosome inactivation which affects almost an entire X chromosome in human females. In a process known as Lyonization one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated during early embryonic stages and becomes visible as the Barr body under the nuclear membrane. As the descendants of each cell keep the same pattern of inactivation a heterozygote for an Xlinked disease will be a mosaic with two cell populations one of which will express the normal and the other the abnormal X chromosome. As a consequence some disorders demonstrate mosaic or patchy symptoms in heterozygous females. More often variability in X inactivation can lead to a milder and more variable clinical and biochemical phenotype in females than in males.Pulled from,askscience,chzxxe2,1,t5_2qm4e1158542,0,t1_chzwxm5,deleted,askscience,chzyc65,2,t5_2qm4e1160104,0,t1_ci02k6c,Yeah its not the best written link in the world.Lonechipmunk has vision pretty well covered.

The sun transfers heat solely by radiation. When sunlight hits a greenhouse it passes through the glass without heating it and then hits objects inside the greenhouse which heat up and over time also heat up the air inside the greenhouse.The heated air cant shed the heat through radiation.

I hope this isnt rude or breaking rules or something but Ive been researching this for a while and its hard to find anything concrete plus I reckon those of you interested in rust would probably be interested in this depending on your depth of knowledge on the subject.For an assignment we were testing rusting of iron in different pHs. We filled test tubes with potassium ferricyanide added a few drops of NaOH to each and dropped iron strips in. Four days later no prussian blue as would be expected if rusting had occurred although there was a small amount of clear liquid at the bottom. But we add HCl and then the solution turns blue at the top where we dripped in the acid and a moment later more precipiate burst from the iron in a little puff. We then had to leave it overnight and the next day it appeared gas had formed because the parafilm we covered the tubes with was stretching and the solution at the bottom of the tubes was transparent.Anyway on the small hope someone here is interested enough to help me its greatly appreciated.

The reason astrobiologists look for planets in a certain range is because they look for environments that are conducive to those reactions.  In chemistry you generally react substances in a solvent.  In this case liquid water is a very good solvent better than say alcohol or liquid methane.  The reasons for this are rather complicated but it means that chemical reactions can take place more effectively in water than in these other substances.Other reasons are that chemical reactions slow down or speed up with temperature.  If a planet is too cold where everything is frozen no chemical reaction will be able to take place and life there cannot occur.  Conversely if the temperature of a planet is too hot the molecules will be broken down before life can evolve.Of course once life has been produced in ideal conditions it can evolve to live in conditions different such as the pressure and cold of the deep oceans and poles on Earth.,askscience,ci4y6zw,3,t5_2qm4e1203867,0,t1_ci51p1k,Yeah just based on what Ive read and discussed here it seems odd that green would be the oly color. If it were to hyperspecialize in some forms of light rather than others it seems that green and blue would be preferential to blue and red.Obviously evolution is not a perfection based system and green is good enough is both entirely possible and seemingly likely  I would think that color is evolutionarily speaking a relatively minor mutation as it seems to be in a lot of other species like random blue lobsters or other such things where there could be the potential for a few isolated species of plants that were highly efficient at absorbing green light in particular might be able to benefit and proliferate in small pockets even if the majority of plants were green simply because it was the first that sprung up and was good enough because of a large presence of white light which includes red green and blue.Given the sheer number of plants that are out there that all seem to follow this same chlorophyll rule it seems kind of odd to me that a mutation like this hasnt occurred somewhere that we know of and that got me to wondering if there was something particularly bad about green light.,askscience,ci51x9i,1,t5_2qm4e1205400,0,t3_27wr2d,deleted,askscience,ci584sk,1,t5_2qm4e1206629,0,t1_ci5cmdy,Help me understand a bit.

This is one of Stephen Jay Goulds arguments which I find much more convincing than most of his other attempts.  Think of the number of individual mutations in all the genes needed to get from brown to polar.  Each new mutation is random so to recreate a polar bear youd have to hope for ten thousand random effects to happen repeatedly.  Whats more each new mutation for its effects depends on the previous mutations because they too alter  the genes environment.  So not only would the bears have to recreate the same mutations theyd have to do it in the same order.  Thats not to say the outcome would be utterly unlike a polar bear.  Convergent evolution happens similar environmental drivers can lead to similar responses.  But there are many ways of reaching a similar effect.  Birds bats and pterosaurs all fly or flew beautifully and have highly effective wings but the structure of those wings is very very different as soon as you look closely.  So you may have something that looks polarbearlike white large hydrodynamic but as soon as you looked more closely would be very different.For example polar bear fur appears white even though the individual hairs are hollow and colorless the white color comes from scattering not pigment.  Most species didnt find the same solution they just have white fur.  A new attempt at polar bears would probably do the same so theyd be different at this basic level.  Almost certainly just about everything that is unique and interesting about polar bears would be lost.,askscience,ci636ab,2,t5_2qm4e1213330,0,t1_ci5yf1h,deleted,askscience,ci6499c,1,t5_2qm4e1214453,0,t1_ci5w0yg,To be pedantic white holes are valid solutions to the vacuum Einstein equations just like Schwarzschild black holes no exotic matter needed you can also get spacelike wormholes.

For the earth to grow you need to have something fueling that new matter being created. They argued this in contrast to the current theory which we hold to be true and have the evidence to support it that the continents are created through plate tectonics.As for the size of the earth it only went through size changes during the very early beginnings of its creation. This was when the earth was just a disk of dust circling the sun which had to slowly build up over time.You can make the argument that the size changed after the moon was knocked off of earths crust. The moon is actually the remnants of a piece of the earths crust which got knocked off when a large planetary body thought to be Marslike in size collided with us. This knocked off a huge chunk of crush which got caught in earths gravity and slowly took shape over time. it actually thought that this helped shape the earth as wellYou can probably argue that the earth lost a bit of mass from that piece of crust getting knocked off though we have no measurements from then to compare.

Even for youtube engineers with google money to burn.         First you can often serve content to several orders of magnitude more users if that content is identical for all users.  This is because serving a copy of the completed page as one object out of a cache is so much cheaper than rebuilding the page by first gathering possibly hundreds of different components across disks and databases and then running it through hundreds or thousands of lines of code to calculate the result.      Youtube clearly doesnt serve the same front page to all users but even caching components of it and caching across similar users can massively reduce their cost and complexity.   Second just considering the database alone the query required is slow and difficult to properly design for exactly the reason you say the sheer number of videos versus users.  In general databases can perform very well looking up information from one table with an index.     For example youtube can say Give me rizlahs email address from the user account table and although its still difficult to do this quickly for millions of users its relatively quick and easy.  But as soon as you want to join information from rizlahs past views with suggested views for this video it is far more difficult.    But it isnt impossible.

Regardless of what you see clinically cocaine does have clinical uses as a topical vasoconstrictor I think receptorligand binding is the basis of all drug action. Most methylxanthines including aminophyline and caffeine work as competetive antagonists on the adenosine A receptor. Diuresis is the direct result of that antagonistic effect by inhibiting the resultant signaling pathways. That is the reason drugs of the same class have similar mechanisms of action despite differences in molecular conformation. Of course the relative potency and efficacy could be different.

Theres some interesting research done on cats regarding neural plasticity in the visual cortex with the takeaway being that theres critical periods when youre young when the brain is able to train and learn things we consider instinctual or so automatic were not aware of it. Language has critical periods as well feral children are a good example of it. Vision auditory processing and memory also have critical periods. In developmental psychology and developmental biology a critical period is a phase in the life span during which an organism has heightened sensitivity to exogenous stimuli that are compulsory for the development of a particular skill. If the organism does not receive the appropriate stimulus during this critical period it may be difficult ultimately less successful or even impossible to develop some functions later in life. The general idea is that failure to learn a particular skill allows the cortical areas normally allocated for that function to fall into disuse as a result these unused brain areas will eventually adapt to perform a different function and therefore will no longer be available to perform other functions. The concurrence of critical periods for the auditory visual and vestibular systems suggests that the time period may be universal for emergent sensory systemsAs related to neural plasticity it is noted that for the rearrangement of synaptic transmission within the visual cortex to occur researchers had to expose the research subjects at a young age Bishop . As is commonly known about the brains plasticity it is most plastic at a young age. This is also true concerning visual perception in which alterations to it can be made at a young age. This realization also means that visual perception is shaped within the visual cortex of the brain during a young age or more specifically during the critical period in the brains development.a PDFCats were raised from birth with one eye viewing horizontal lines and one eye viewing vertical lines. Elongated receptive fields of cells in the visual cortex were horizontally or vertically orientedno oblique fields were found.

I think a lot of the confusion here stems from underappreciation of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Fundamentally an integral is limit of sums of areas of rectangles just sticking with the Riemann integral for now. Theres no a priori relationship between integration and differentiation.The fundamental theorem of calculus then states a very fortunate relationship between the two ideas gives you a new way to calculate integrals via antiderivatives instead of Riemann sums then for the remainder of the calculus course the Riemann sums are subsequently completely forgotten about and the statement of the FTC is eventually taken for granted. One thing that is usually misremembered though is the stern warning You wont be able to integrate everything!. The truth of course is merely that not everything has a basic antiderivative. in fact like ubruin notes you can integrate far more things than you can differentiate. Similarly in the differential calculus course the limit definition of a derivative is talked about then forgotten as you learn all the rules for the courses particular zoo of functions xn ex sinx etc..The irony of this is that most practical applications of calculus compute their integrals and derivatives using something like Riemann sums and difference quotients and not antiderivatives or symbolic formulas. ,askscience,cicxfa6,3,t5_2qm4e1274246,0,t3_28mxt9,deleted,askscience,cicyxgf,1,t5_2qm4e1275085,0,t3_28opwv,A cool fact about cold water is that when it freezes the salinity increases and so does the density of water.

The only information Mass  can receive from the black hole is the mass of everything inside of it acting as a gravitational pull towards it center.On the other hand the sudden disappearance of a gravitational field doesnt quite make sense to me. Wouldnt there be gravitational wave ripples if the origins of such such fields suddenly snapped from a position at the event horizon to the position of the center of the black hole any time something crossed its event horizon?And lastly in the diagrams when Mass  crosses the event horizon would force Fm still exist?

Ill concede that weve been using the same basic idea of large wing engines hanging off from the wing long cylindrical fuselage and horizontal and vertical tail configuration for passenger aircraft since at least the s. But its a matter of opinion as to what kind of design changes youd consider significantly different. The aerodynamic design of a s DC wing crosssection is markedly different from that on a modern transonic airliner and the structural layout is quite different as well. The DC was using physical cables to connect the pilot controls to the control surfaces today were using flybywire electronics. The state of avionics has also obviously progressed rapidly autopilot GPS instrument landing etc.  There are also a lot of humanfactors constraints aircraft designers would love to have passengers all lie facedown and motionless packed as small and thin as possible in a thin crosssection for the entire flight. But people want seats they want windows they want aisles they can walk down to the bathroom and more importantly stewardesses to bring them food and drink. This practically forces on you a fuselage thats laid out something like a bus. It should also be considered in the context of how technology advances. Think of the computermicroprocessor industry. A modern CPU isnt really drastically different in technology than the original xs the primary advancement has just been in manufacturing technology. And thats an industry where chip manufacturers can rapidly prototype new ideas and create new lines of chips on the order of a few months to a year. Compare this to a full size aircraft where development of a new aircraft like a  takes on the order of a decade or more at absolutely massive financial investment cost and risk high financial risk also equates to an aversion to drastically new design ideas. When it takes  years to development a new passenger aircraft its not surprising that we havent seen dramatic shifts in design ideas since the s although the advent of high bypass turbines transonic flight and modern avionics are fairly dramatic. Id also argue that by your metric the same question could be asked why are current generations of trains still using the same designs as the steam locomotives of the s  All that in mind you should look into blended wingbody BWB and boxwing concepts for ideas of pretty different looking airliners of the future.,askscience,cixaua0,13,t5_2qm4e1445224,0,t3_2angov,Nuclear engineer here.The nuclear fission reaction used in nuclear power and weapons applications is a selfsustaining chain reaction. The criteria for a self sustaining reaction means that the neutrons released by the reaction need to cause  or more subsequent reactions. If the neutron output of the reaction is not enough to drive the same number of reactions then the nuclear reactor will shut down.When the atom is split a neutron is born. For the majority of nuclear power applications we utilize thermal fission. The neutron that is born from a fission reaction has too much energy to cause another thermal fission. It needs to slow down. As the neutron is slowing down there is a probability that the neutron will leak out of the system a probability that it will be absorbed by something that is not fuel a probability that it will be absorbed and not cause another reaction a probability that that it will undergo a resonance absorption into the moderator and a number of other possibilities. Not every neutron that is born is capable of making it all the way through the process of slowing down and getting absorb properly into the fuel to cause another fission reaction however as long as we can maintain the reaction  that is for every neutron that causes a fission  neutron from the next generation is capable of causing fission we can maintain a criticalselfsustaining chain reaction.Now earlier I said that nuclear power reactors utilize thermal fission. Of the two natural uranium isotopes only U is fissile in the thermal region. U is not fissile with thermal neutrons however U tends to not absorb a lot of neutrons less losses and it has a possibility to breed into Pu which IS fissile and can be used as fuel later in the reactors fuel cycle. This makes U a good filler material for these types of reactors. The U is the primary fuel. The concentration enrichment of U is chosen based on the probability that neutrons are lost between generations. For a light water based reactor natural uranium does not have a sufficient concentration of U to allow for a selfsustaining chain reaction. The light water will absorb too many neutrons. However if you increase the enrichment you now have a greater number of targets that can absorb a neutron and fission this increases the probability that a neutron is absorbed in the fuel versus something else which increases the number of fissions that occur in the reactor and the number of neutrons you get out will greatly exceed the number of neutrons being absorbed by water or lost to other means.In some reactor types like heavy water reactors CANDU design they do not need to enrich their uranium. They utilize heavy water deuterium which has a very low probability of absorbing a neutron. This means that more neutrons will be available in the core because less are absorbed by other stuff and it means you can have a critical reaction with a lower fuel enrichment.gt If anything I would expect the opposite U has a heavier nucleus so it should be more likely to fall apart.U has an even atomic mass number. This reduces the probability of fission. U has an odd number. There are other subatomic properties due to the specific configuration of UUPu the primary fissile elements which improve the chances of them undergoing thermal fission. This reason for this is a little more out of my expertise but odd numbers have a greater probability to fission.,askscience,cixfocl,2,t5_2qm4e1445784,0,t1_cix9cqx,deleted,askscience,cixi78a,0,t5_2qm4e1446654,0,t3_2apz0o,deleted,askscience,cixm4hz,1,t5_2qm4e1450697,0,t1_ciy47m5,deleted,askscience,ciy4ccc,1,t5_2qm4e1454841,0,t1_ciye446,On cats okay.

Your chances of being a match with a sibling is due to only sharing about  of your genes on average. Spread that over multiple MHC genes and the odds become pretty low of an exact match. The thing that improves the odds with siblings is that within a given ethnic group the number of MHC variants at specific genes can be fairly low. For example at one MHC locus your parents could have only one variant making it a  chance youll match at that locus. Add to that the fact that some MHC genes are much more important for rejection than others and it greatly improves the chances of matching a sibling over the general population.MHC genes tend to diverge quickly among different populations probably due in part to novel pathogens encountered in different parts of the world. The end result is that matching a donor at random is partly a matter of how many people from your ethnic group have registered as donors. If your ancestors mostly hail from a small tribe in South America the chances of matching a donor in the United States where a majority of the donors are of European ancestry is pretty small. ,askscience,ciz96ls,1,t5_2qm4e1460397,0,t3_2avv1y,deleted,askscience,cizc451,1,t5_2qm4e1460398,0,t3_2avjtl,deleted,askscience,cizc4av,1,t5_2qm4e1460682,0,t3_2asyv5,deleted,askscience,cizdejo,1,t5_2qm4e1461721,0,t1_cizga7g,If youre most interested in doing pharmacology and developing psychopharmaceuticals the chem degree is going to be the most interesting and helpful class for you.

One is the kinetic temperature of the gas  basically the mean speed of all the particles in some region of space.

But allow me to give a slightly more complex answer and provide support for this answer by breaking down how the new heavier elements actually form.First and foremost no current physics or even mathematics can accurately describe the processes that are occurring inside of a black hole. For the purposes of this discussion we will be considering the accretion disk of the black hole instead. As several other posts have described the accretion disk is VERY energetic. Any system that can generate Xrays is theoretically capable of producing heavy elements just like any random atom is theoretically capable of spontaneously transforming into a gold atom. This essentially means that it is possible but highly unlikely. In our case the likelihood is primarily a function of pressure. Since the accretion disks of black holes produce xrays we can make the assumption that the energy required to form new heavier elements is present but we still need to account for the way that this energy prefers to disperse or rather manifest. In an accretion disk we may see high temperature and high energy but there are no processes at work that contain or hold the matter in place. This means that as the matterenergy begins to disperse it will preferentially manifest as radiation which is why we see so many xrays in these systems. But wait a minute were talking about a black hole here. How can you say there isnt a mechanism to hold the matterenergy in place?Well it is certainly true that the accretion disk is bound by the black hole but we need to think more locally within the disk. The black hole is at the center of the disk. Though it gravitational binds the disk itself it is not actively compressing the disk in a way that prevents material from leaving the system. In other words material can leave the system. When we are looking at processes that preferentially generate new heavier elements we need a system where matter and energy cannot easily leave the system. The creation of heavy elements is somewhat akin to a snowball effect. To show this lets look at a rather massive star as it fuses to Iron.First we have hydrogen which fuses to helium which combines with more hydrogen to form helium which then combines to form beryllium which then combines with helium to form carbon which then combines with helium to form oxygen which then combines with oxygen to form silicon at which point silicon meltingburning begins to occur and through another complicated series of interactions Iron begins to form. If you are interested in silicon melting I recommend this book Alas I digress.It is easy to see that the procession REQUIRES pieces of the system to remain in the system. But that only provides part of the picture. Eventually once nucleosynthesis has achieved Iron it will stop producing heavier elements as it is no longer an efficient use of energy or perhaps there just is not enough energy. Thus Iron begins to build up in the core of the star.Eventually there is enough Iron to produce a gravitational collapse. This is where the heavier elements form. As the star collapses under its own weight not only does it continue to contain the matter in its system but it actively compresses it supplying even more energy to the matter in the system. Under such intense compression it is no longer energy efficient for matter to remain as Iron and so the Iron is fused with all the other constituents of the star to form the heavier elements we have seen. This presumably is where the new heavier elements are produced.So to come full circle it is unlikely that the accretion disk will generate any kind of new heavier element because for this to happen all of the steps described above must be met in one way or another. It is more likely that we will see the generation of lighter elements which are then ejected very energetically into space and radiated away from the system before they are allowed to snowball and form new heavier elements.That being said in an infinite universe anything that can happen WILL happen given enough time.Thus yes a black hole should be able to indirectly generate new heavier elements but it is highly unlikely. It would also be intensely difficult to prove this as these new heavier elements would decay into more stable matter very quickly and measuring anything within the disk would be extremely difficult.TLDR  Yes.,askscience,cj8hval,13,t5_2qm4e1533501,0,t3_2bs0br,deleted,askscience,cj8i14t,1,t5_2qm4e1535902,0,t3_2bs4gt,The guys at Freakonomics think its pretty safe and the dangers are overblownWikipedia claims there arent good statistics because nobody tracks how many hitchhikers there are per year.

However consider the following scenario An ant is born into a colony and because of the quality and quantity of food it is fed as a larvae by other workers or the queen it does not develop into a reproductively mature adult.In the above scenario natural selection would certainly favor a genetic factor that has that worker help out the rest of the colony her half sisters versus dieing or wandering off but it would be difficult to call such assistance altruistic and it is certainly not a case of an organism helping relatives at the cost of his or her own reproduction i.e. kin selection since it is strictly unable to mate note not all helpers are permanently sterile. Further consider the possibility that the queencolony caused the worker to become sterile by manipulating its food supply. If the sterile worker helps the colony in any way natural selection would favor behaviors in the queen that cause workers to become sterile.I hope that clarifies my view somewhat.

So the typical ant in the nest already doesnt feed itself.  Sure a queen or brood  tender theoretically could feed itself but in practice as long as it is in the nest it doesnt get the chance.  So warriors who fight instead of foraging will already be fed by other ants.  From there jaws could easily become so adapted for fighting that they are no longer even capable of foraging for food and have to be fed.  ,askscience,cjgteub,1,t5_2qm4e1599997,0,t1_cjgszxw,deleted,askscience,cjguke9,1,t5_2qm4e1600481,0,t1_cjgw4jg,deleted,askscience,cjgwrci,1,t5_2qm4e1600708,0,t1_cjgv68u,Thanks for the suggestion I will try my luck there.,askscience,cjgxsg2,1,t5_2qm4e1604740,0,t1_cjhevd1,deleted,askscience,cjhg1ye,1,t5_2qm4e1605258,0,t1_cjhf3h0,You are thinking about evolution the wrong way.

However we know that Europa is primarily made of silicate rock with perhaps an iron core.  If it has a liquid ocean underneath the icy surface scientists dont agree on whether it actually does and we dont have any proof but there are good theories to explain why it could be possible it would only extend down to the rocky surface.  Since Europa is much less massive than earth gravitational acceleration is only . ms the required depth of water to get  MPa is  m or  km.  Since Europas radius is only  km that would require the oceans to go down almost  of the way down to the center of the moon and the oceans certainly arent that deep.Besides as you start going down to depths that are not small with respect to the radius of the moonplanet gravitational acceleration is no longer constant and actually decreases as you go down so the ocean would have to be even deeper than that!,askscience,cjiiojs,2,t5_2qm4e1613975,0,t1_cjil9rj,even then still implies some brief passage of time.

This is cupped by another tube that wraps around the glomerulus called the Bowmans capsule which is the smallest part of the urinary collection system. The cells in the Bowmans capsule that directly contact the glomerulus are called podocytes which have a very specialized intercellular connection system that serves as a sort of sieve.The blood comes into the glomerulus and the driving pressure pushes a fraction of the plasma through the glomerular wall and through the podocytes. This gives a glomerular filtrate in the Bowmans capsule which is then extensively resorbed through the rest of the nephron to make urine.The raw glomerular filtrate is composed of low molecular weight compounds lt kDa which excludes almost all plasma proteins and so forth that easily pass between the endothelial cells of the glomerulus and the podocytes of the Bowmans capsule. We use things like creatinine and urea as blood urea nitrogen or BUN small molecules that are metabolic byproducts as proxies of measurement of how quickly the glomeruli are filtering things the glomerular filtration rate or GFR. Sometimes we use a marker administered experimentally like inulin. These molecules pass right through the glomerulus into the capsule and then significantly arent largely touched by the rest of the nephron. So the lower the concentration of these in the blood the higher the GFR. GFR is a basic measurement of how well the kidneys are working. Theres a number of ways that you can screw things up in the kidney and the vast majority hit the glomerulus. For instance scarring or inflammation can reduce GFR by reducing the number of nephrons. Or having an abundance of high molecular weight proteins in the blood can clog up the fine sieve of the glomerular wallpodocytes. One needs to be careful though because things that increase metabolic waste like for instance digesting a protein load can increase blood urea nitrogen as well. Or dehydration can increase BUN and Cr although dehydration is a common cause of true reduced GFR in a number of respects.BUN and Cr are two of the most common lab tests we run.

As the number of particles involved becomes very large the chance of the network being connected ends up having a very sharply defined critical point where the probability flips from  to  based on the Kolmogorov zeroone law. This is just a mathematical result in graph theory and probability but it applies to a lot of real world cases.As an example as you heat a block of ice you increase the chance of any given bond in the crystal will be broken. At a certain critical temperature you cross a threshold where it goes from being very likely that the crystal is connected together to being very likely that the crystal is disconnected.I believe this is the common reason you have well defined critical points between phases of matter as well as in a number of other scenarios such as the Curie temperature.,askscience,cjnpp54,3,t5_2qm4e1656955,0,t1_cjnzubu,deleted,askscience,cjo0tei,1,t5_2qm4e1657136,0,t3_2dc0dc,Its always metric so you should always use Celcius.

Many people believe that a pvalue of lets say . means that there is a  chance that the null hypothesis is true. This is incorrect. A pvalue of . merely means that there is a  chance that your sample would come out differing by as much or more from the null hypothesis as it did. Many people do not understand that there is a difference between these  sentences.I am at work so I cant spend a lot of time on a response. I recently wrote a response about someone trying to prove an item drop rate in a game using pvalues. I will post my response below so that you can read it as it is very relevant but different information.gtThere are clearly a lot of people here including OP who do not understand PValues. A while back I stumbled across this article. It describes a logical fallacy with pvalues that many people even scientists running experiments overlook.A pvalue describes the probability that a random sample taken using the same criteria of the sample used to form the pvalue will have a statistic greater than or equal to the statistic in the sample used to calculate the pvalue assuming that the null hypothesis is true.In this case the null hypothesis is that the probability of demimateria drop is the same on day  and day . This can be defined as the sample probability on day   sample probability on day   . The sample statistic is the value of the probability on day   the probability on day  in this case .. Now we can construct a test based on the samples parameters these parameters being the number of samples on each day. Doing so gives us a pvalue of . as the author says. I am not going to check his math I will believe it.This does not mean that there is a  chance that the drop rates are the same and therefore a  chance they are not. What this means is that If the null hypothesis is true then  of samples like this one will show results equal to or with more difference in their probabilities then this one.While this is evidence that the  probabilities are not the same it does not in any way what so ever constitute an academic level of proof that they are not.The math only tells us that  of samples will show this difference if the means are the same. The point is how do we know this is not one of those . The answer is that more trials must be run using a similar sample.,askscience,cjpl1dz,2,t5_2qm4e1669622,0,t1_cjplu3t,If you go too close to the nest the mama bird will hold her wing out at an angle and sometimes the tail feathers too.

The planets motion doesnt actually have much at all to do with this its just because of the specific simplified example in Wikipedia that you end up with the planets velocity being added to the space crafts velocity.Lets mark the space crafts initial heliocentric velocity v a vector as are all the other following velocities and the planets heliocentric velocity u. Then the space crafts velocity relative to the planet is vvu. The space craft swings around the planet in any direction really and the velocity relative to the planet after this is v. Lets write dvvv so dv is the change of velocity of the space craft in the reference frame of the planet. Now the velocity relative to the Sun is     vvu      vdvu      vudvu      vdvIn other words the final heliocentric velocity is the initial heliocentric velocity plus the change of velocity in the reference frame of the planet not that the reference frame matters for dv. As long as that change of velocity is not against your initial heliocentric velocity the magnitude of your final velocity will increase. It is quite clearly possible to increase your momentum for example upwards. You only need to swing around the planets south pole. And as you may have noticed u does not appear there at all in the end.,askscience,cjt0keb,3,t5_2qm4e1696935,0,t1_cjt21ad,deleted,askscience,cjt28la,5,t5_2qm4e1696997,0,t3_2dt6ns,deleted,askscience,cjt2ir4,1,t5_2qm4e1697072,0,t3_2dt6ns,deleted,askscience,cjt2v0c,1,t5_2qm4e1697363,0,t3_2dr9fp,deleted,askscience,cjt46kv,1,t5_2qm4e1697559,0,t1_cjt3cff,gtPeople have been without shoes for s of thousands years.People have also dumped human waste in their water supply and eaten undercooked or poorly preserved meat for hundreds of thousands of years.

Clouds are made of tiny droplets of water or ice. They are formed when water vapor condenses within pockets of rising air. Under the right conditions the air continues to be uplifted causing the cloud to build higher and higher. The tiny water droplets and ice crystals in clouds are just the right size to scatter all colors of light compared with the smaller molecules of air that scatter blue light most effectively. When light contains all colors we perceive it as white.When clouds are thin they let a large portion of the light through and appear white. But like any objects that transmit light the thicker they are the less light makes it through. As their thickness increases the bottoms of clouds look darker but still scatter all colors.

Due to this mixture of components mixed in the liquid the flow behaviour rheology of inks is nonNewtonian which essentially means its viscosity changes with shear stress and possibly time. More specifically in the case of inks they typically have a small yield stress that prevents them from flowing below a given shear stress. They are also thixotropic which means that once the ink has begun to flow at a given shear stress it will become thinner less viscous with time.A number of of mechanisms will prevent the ink from flowing through the nib of the pen. Firstly surface tension probably plays a significant role as the gap in the nib of the pen is very small.

I know that there are at least some theories of spacetime that attempt to quantize space and it occurred to me that if this is the case then these quanta of space themselves must have some sort of intrinsic spacial measurement. If that were the case then mustnt any motion be relative to this underlying structural matrix and as such that there is actually an absolute reference grid.This would depend on this underlying structure being measureable and not merely some probabilistic sea though. As you can see this isnt a well thoughtout line of pursuit merely some interesting questions which popped into my mind and I was hoping to find educated answers to.To the concept that the universe has no absolute center does that mean that if you travel in a straight line though at the number of dimensions space occupies this definition may need adjustment youd eventually end up back in the same place again?

Current research points to sleep as the time the brain performs certain housekeeping tasks such as removal of metabolic byproducts conversion of shortterm memory to longterm and degradation of amyloid protein. Some theories suggest that long term low level sleep deprivation is a risk factor for Alzheimers dementia. There is also a disease called familial fatal insomnia which is an autosomal dominant prion disease which leads to inability to sleep. The average survival from the onset of insomnia is about a year and a half. It isnt known if the actual lack of sleep is fatal but the symptoms progressing toward death are the same as those in sleep deprivation.

They typically have emission energies of  MeV which gives them a speed around  the speed of light. The alpha particle leaves so fast the electrons dont have a chance to join the party. Wait for me!  These extra electrons will usually just leave eventually because the radioactive atom will exchange them with neighboring atoms. They could also be scattered away by the alpha particle if they happen to be close enough.  And what makes the alpha particle so destructive is that it will knock electrons loose from innocent bystanders ionizing atoms along the way.As for beta decay the atom does become positively charged.

Both the origin and decay of magnetic fields in neutron stars is not understood and its an active field of research. Ive recently started working on this problem in my own research. As other posters stated neutron stars arent just pure neutrons theres other stuff there too. The crust for example is a solid lattice of heavy ions and the core is probably some sort of exotic quarkgluon plasma. The mantle is probably a very large fraction of neutrons but the crust has a weird mess of neutrons with some protons and electrons that are in equilibrium with the neutrons neutrons beta decay into a proton electron and antineutrino and protons and electrons merge to make neutrons at the same rate.Anyway even with twenty times as many neutrons as protons the density of neutron stars are so high that the density of charged bodies is absurd. We think that the inner crust of the star may be able to host electric currents that are strong enough to create their massive magnetic fields and were calculating the electrical conductivity of the inner crust to see how resistive the material might be to get an idea for how big of a field this mechanism could support and how long it would take to decay away by resistive losses to the crust.

Our sun for example can become a black hole if it is squeezed into a sphere of km.During the normal life of a massive star its core produces enough heat to keep its atoms separated. This means that while the core has fuel it will never reach the density required to collapse into a black hole. Once it runs out of fuel to burn the outer layers of the star will start to fall down onto the core. This increases the pressure on the core which in turn increases its density.

One is gravitational mass and determines how strong gravity attracts you. So in this case yes adding another person will increase the Force of Gravity on you guys. The second type of mass is inertial mass which essentially measures how much resistance you have against being accelerated. Since two people have more mass this means you guys will resist the Earths gravitational force more than you would alone.These two masses have  the exact same values. And so essentially they cancel each other out The extra gravitational force due to the second person will be cancelled out by the fact that two people have more inertia and are harder to accelerate.

You can come up with as many reasons why Im wrong as you want In my experience in the professional world what Im saying is true.gtI think the problem is the assumption that people who get this can understand people who dont. In fact I would argue that each person who doesnt understand has a different incorrect idea.Again you are and have been this whole time seeing the trees but not the forest. The original question Why dont we use Bels instead of decibels? And my original answer  Because decibels fit our general use scale better so people tend to gravitate towards it remain true in my experience. Maybe your boss responds better to an exact answer reduced to smallest scale ie Bels instead of deciBels but in my experience the wide majority of people get deciBels better and understand the scaling better in decibels. Again this is just my experience with my bosses none of whom are stupid or cant compute logartihms or any of that but certainly dont understand the finer points of what a decibel is measuring or would immediately relate dB to half power. We have a lot of examples of using a scale that works.. but we always like to stick to whole numbersavoid fractions and keep a minimum from that point. For instance you likely dont measure your height in yards nor do you measure your houses ceiling heights nor would you measure the distance to the atlantic ocean in meters unless you live on the coast in that case use the pacific ocean. In each case we try our best to reduce our scale to a convenient point which tends to be whole numbers. ie you are  taller than me not . feet.Again remember we are talkign about communicating an idea to the general populace. Not that theyre stupid just that they will understand your meaning a lot better on average if you a stick to a consistent scale and btry to use whole numbers,askscience,ckkhkbp,1,t5_2qm4e1920002,0,t1_ckkeyd5,Although ADP has some energy to it the end product of fat metabolism is to make ATP not ADP.

Just because there is not yet a unifying theory does not mean that the general theory of relativity is invalidated. There are competing theories of evolution for example many learned people discussing the validity of multiple different avenues which all explain a given series of observations.Laws describe only very specialized situations ohms law for example can be said to describe only linear networks  that is to say it will apply  of the time under very constrained conditions there are no discussions of competing variants of ohms law. The disagreement over whether or not they are similar is a semantic one. They are useful for entirely different purposes but in the context of a laymans discussion of the development of scientific understanding I argue they can be viewed as similar. Theories are based to a degree upon laws laws say what does happen then theories are a mechanism for describing how and why it does happen.

Each oxygen in both molecules is has two covalent bonds the black lines in a basic molecular diagram. In addition to this the oxygens have two lone pairs of electrons. These lone pairs have negative interactions with the other atoms in the molecule and thus want to get as far away as possible to minimize their energy. Since oxygen is highly electronegative it doesnt mind having alot of electrons clustered around it. As a result even though each atom has a full valence shell of electrons the oxygens have a slightly negative charge while the hydrogens have a slightly positive charge. The hydrogen bond is then the electrostatic interaction between the partially positive hydrogen of one molecule and lone pair of electrons of a different molecules oxygen. These are the strongest type noncovalent interactions between molecules. Both dipoledipole and london dispersion forces are at play but relatively weak. Since water has two hydrogens and two lone pairs on each molecule there are tons on hydrogen bonds. This gives water its high boiling point for a molecule with such a low molecular mass. Hydrogen peroxide has very similar characteristics with four lone pairs and two hydrogens that can all engage in Hbonds even more so than water. Its melting point is slightly lower as some hydrogen bonds are disrupted in the freezing process an unfavorable process. ,askscience,ckmk0sn,2,t5_2qm4e1937161,0,t1_ckmkxve,Australia has the largest natural Uranium reserves in the world and is one of the worlds biggest Uranium exporters. ,askscience,ckmmb23,2,t5_2qm4e1937616,0,t1_ckmnout,Dont those create Waste material suitable for nuclear bombs?,askscience,ckmoaop,3,t5_2qm4e1937818,0,t1_ckmoyjz,deleted,askscience,ckmp6es,1,t5_2qm4e1938054,0,t1_ckmo0oa,To simplify it a person would freeze to death in the winter but if they sit near a fire they will live.

Where had one single variable been different at the conception of the Universe everything now could be totally different?Well we dont know.  The initial conditions of the universe are obscure to us  we have almost no idea what the fundamental inputs were.  We can talk about many of the early conditions density temperature  distribution etc. but even those variables are likely derivative of whatever the true inputs were they are more consequences of the inputs than the inputs themselves.In my opinion probably there are some initial conditions which vary chaotically and probably there are other initial conditions which do not.  It is of course also possible that none of the initial conditions are chaotic but that chaos arose spontaneously during early phase transitions.  The opposite might even be true as well.  We really have no idea.gtif we somehow hypothetically had a way to know EVERY single variable that there was in a situation I know this isnt possible then we could accurately predict every event.Youre basically asking is the universe fully deterministic or is there some degree of stochasticism probabilistic randomness?  In absolute terms we dont know.  This goes to the heart of our best theories of quantum mechanics  and there are some interpretations that take it to be fully deterministic and others that reject full determinism.However it is worth saying that there are certain kinds of fully deterministic theories which have been almost definitively ruled out.  You might say there are  kinds of theories studied today   local hidden variable theories  global hidden variable theories and  quantum mechanics which has been the most successful of all three types in terms of making predictions.Einstein was a big supporter of the first kind which includes deterministic theories where in principle we could make perfect predictions but that there are some ordinary variables which we have not yet identified and are not aware of.  Unfortunately local hidden variable theories have basically been ruled out by tests of something called Bells theorem  Bells theorem asks can local hidden variable theories reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics? and it provides a means to test whether that is possible.  This is also a test of whether nature obeys classical statistics or quantummechanical statistics.  After dozens of experiments all of them have come back unanimously that nature obeys quantummechanical statistics and no local hidden variables cant reproduce all the predictions of quantum mechanics even in principle.  In other words there is no local hidden variable theory that will describe nature as accurately as quantum mechanics does.On that note there have been some objections to the experimental Bell tests that have been done.  A fistful of loopholes have been identified by which a local hidden variable theory might actually be able to reproduce quantum mechanical predictions unless the loophole is closed.  Of the dozens of Bell tests that have been done every loophole has been closed by at least one experiment however no experiment has been performed that has closed all loopholes at the same time.  Consequently the general consensus is that nobody really expects local hidden variable theories to possibly be successful but nobody has proven beyond the shadow of all doubt that this is true.  We will just have to wait and see.Now ... Bells theorem is avoided by the other case  global hidden variable theories.  In a local theory the missing information that is needed to make perfect predictions is local meaning that information is only accessible in the vicinity of the system being studied and that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light.  An example of a local variable would be the position of a particle or its momentum or its energy.  In a global hidden variable theory the missing information is accessible everywhere at all points in space and there is no need for the information to travel.  A good example would be the gravitational constant G which has the same value for all points in space.Bells theorem doesnt apply to global hidden variable theories.  However it is somewhat widely regarded that global hidden variable theories are objectionable  because then there are many local variables which are fully determined by global variables and its basically impossible to distinguish what those global variables might be or how many there are.One of the best examples of a global hidden variable theory is called de BroglieBohm theory also known as pilot wave theory.Quantum mechanics is centered on the idea of the wavefunction and many interpretations regard the wavefunction as physically real and that it determines or represents the actual state of a system.In pilotwave theory the wavefunction is also considered physically real but in addition to the wavefunction a global configuration is proposed which includes all of the local state variables for all particles in the universe.  In other words the evolution of particle states is partly determined by the state of all other particles in the universe.  As you can imagine that this idea gets taken seriously is upsetting to a lot of people  it basically promotes all local variables into global variables with no reason they cannot change on a whim due to changes in distant systems.  Yet in nature we observe that some local variables do seem to obey local physics very strongly.Interestingly pilotwave theory has started gaining more traction as of late and a growing number of scientists think it needs to be reconsidered.  A chief motivation is the fact that an experimental researcher has been able to reproduce quantum correlations in an entirely classical system he reproduced the statistics of the doubleslit experiment but with macroscopic objects!  Its really very interesting  you can check out a couple of the videos below for yourself.

Scrolling is something that can be tracked. Theres offtheshelf software that can provide that functionality like  I think that tool also tracks mouse hovers. JavaScript has an onScroll event that you can attach handlers to its not really all that complicated.Facebook in particular can most certainly track scroll behavior because they lazyload their page i.e. more content loads as you scroll down. They can look at their own servers and see what requests are being made. If they want to instrument their page further they could track every scroll event individually and look at timestamp differences to tell timeoncontent.Do they actually do this? Probably at least some of it. What do they use it for? Hells if I know. They most certainly use it for ops loadbalancing servers and projecting how much bandwidth they are using.

So as it rotates around the probability of a point going off to infinity is higher if the point is closer to the real al line.  So the complex component at the nth step determines the probability of the point escaping to infinity at the nth step.I put probability in quotes because its not truly a random process  its pseudorandom and the true probability is always exactly  or  its just that you cant know that until you finish the computation  thanks to the halting problem.  In fact problems like these are what the halting problem is all about its basically a proof that you cant know what certain recursive functions are going to do without actually doing them.Its because of the Halting problem that you cant really ever understand exactly whats going on in a fractal. Its essentially pseudorandom.  The probability of a point rotating so that its close the real line at step n is also determined by the imaginary component at step n. So you can imagine it as a point on a line that passes through the origin and rotates by a random pseudorandom amount for each iteration n.  If its close to the real line at n then it has a higher probability of escaping if the overall length is large component is large.  Anyway this is really just meant to try to describe a way to think about it  I dont really know if its totally correct I could be missing something. In fact in general I kind of think is that you cant really explain math just using a bunch of words unless theyre highly technical words that have precise mathematical definitions.If you really want to understand it I would recommend trying a few examples on paper to see how the imaginary component actually affects things as you do the computation. That way youll be able to see for yourself how it works and get an intuitive sense of whats happening.  Writing a computer program like AsAChemicalEngineer did is also a good idea you can have the program print out each step of an iteration to see whats happening to specific points as theyre computed. ,askscience,ckp8cpc,3,t5_2qm4e1958928,0,t3_2h22az,deleted,askscience,ckp949k,1,t5_2qm4e1959643,0,t1_ckonph8,deleted,askscience,ckpc7vc,1,t5_2qm4e1959923,0,t1_ckp2giv,The exact question was Why is Ebola so successful this time around?.

Then the flip would occur after that with the normal northsouth configuration reforming only in the reverse orientation.This reorientation could happen over the course of only a few decades if I recall correctly.I think there wouldnt be much of an increase in harmful radiation as a result of the weakening of the earths magnetic field because the earths atmosphere does such a great job of shielding the surface from ionizing radiation. Remember that the geomagnetic field shifts and concentrates the incoming charged subatomic particles from the CME towards each of the polar regions where they interact with the upper atmosphere ionizing the atmospheric gasses and causing them to flouress resulting in the auroras. Most of the energy from the radiation is absorbed by the upper atmosphere and reradiated as visible light. Inuit and Siberian people dont as far as I know suffer from increased cancer rates even though they live under the northern lights all through the dark of winter months of every year.Dont confuse the auroras with the ozone holes in the polar regions. Cancer rates might be increased in polar regions as the result of increased ultraviolate light as a component of sunlight during the summer but not from the types of ionizing radiation that were talking about from coronal mass ejections that cause auroras.The scientists who were interviewed for the NOVA episode didnt seem to be too worried about negative economic impacts. They said our presentday electrical grid would be vulnerable to the kind of blackout that happened in Montreal but we could adapt with enough advanced notice. Satellites would be vulnerable as well but future satellites could be hardened against any increase in radiation that might occur in space.They seemed to be more excited about the prospect of having the stunning auroras all over the globe every night than fearful of any possibly negative consequences from it.,askscience,cksp0oa,11,t5_2qm4e1987817,0,t1_cks9nbh,Not to mention that even if we couldnt have detected such a planet through the effects of gravity it would be easily observable from other celestial bodies such as from the moon or Mars,askscience,cksqdxt,1,t5_2qm4e1987999,0,t3_2hf6tu,deleted,askscience,cksr6c8,1,t5_2qm4e1990585,0,t1_ckt0z8g,Ive been meaning to get a sonic reader that can hear my rats...

I do not know of a more modern study.As someone that has performed at a very high level in endurance sports I would challenge your assumption that these players have good cardiovascular fitness.  They are unbelievably strong but the kinds of efforts they perform do not really put much load on the cardiovascular system when compared to sports that are primarily focused on aerobic exertion.My suspicion is that they are cardiovascularly fitter than the average sedentary person but they are hopelessly short of athletes whose sports are largely cardio driven running rowing cycling xc skiing etc.  Big reductions in CVD are seen in those populations.  I suspect the extra body mass carried by NFL players during their sedentary times is a net negative for longterm health outcomes.That plus all the injuries.,askscience,ckt9wci,71,t5_2qm4e1992697,0,t3_2hirpz,As with any other chemical  you can often make them yourself using cheaper precursors.

Depending on the capacity and number of cylinders this will vary but its mostly around one third of maximum engine speed with about three quarters of wide open throttle. As the engine moves out of this operating zone it becomes progressively less efficient with the worst performance in partial load small throttle angle and high engine speed. This relationship is expressed as a property named Brake Specific Fuel Consumption BSFC. Engines are typically more efficient under load but auto makers mostly implement fixed discrete gear ratios so we dont have a huge amount of control over the engine speed for a given throttle position. To answer your question specifically road gradient puts the engine under load causing the driver to open up the throttle and move the engine into a more efficient zone. The problem here is that the driver may go into wide open throttle andor move the engine out of the optimal speed range in order to maintain a set speed. If the hill is very steep it may be a better strategy to build speed in the optimal range and then let that speed dissipate as the vehicle makes its way up the hill then build up to set speed before backing off to cruise at the set speed on the flat again.Obviously this only applies to petroleum powered engines which generally have a throttle rather than diesel powered which dont have a throttle but similar principles apply.

You already know about the AT and GC base pairs. A sequence of bases can either be coding e.g. a template for a protein or RNA or it can be noncoding e.g. a binding site for enhancers or  junk DNA. If we look at both protein and RNAcoding regions there will be repetitions based simply on the structural requirements for each macromolecule. The picture is pretty complicated and not very well understood for RNA but we know a lot about that of proteins. DNA coding for a protein determines the proteins amino acid sequence each amino acid is encoded by a base triplet such as ATG for methionine or GGG for glycine. These codon triplets will obviously be repeated in a genome since almost all proteins utilize the same codons and since one protein can obviously contain several of the same amino acid for the sake of example encoded by the same codon.Another feature is that there are repetitive regions in the DNA. Sometimes they may code for a protein domain and sometimes there are many of the same domains lined up after each other. Sometimes they are repetitive DNA regions without any known function. In these cases you usually have a longer stretch of bases which repeat a n number of times. Am I on the right track on what you are asking here? I can give a more thorough answer once I know what you are looking after.,askscience,cl091wv,1,t5_2qm4e2048958,0,t1_cl09b80,What youre describing is simply the normal placebo effect. ,askscience,cl09n0y,16,t5_2qm4e2049391,0,t3_2iah4m,Thank you for your submission!

For an observer outside of the car they may appear to be moving faster or slower depending on the movement of the car and the propagation direction of the sound than the speed of sound since the air inside the air is moving relative to him.

Adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and the object so napkin and cohesion is the force between the water molecules i.e the adhesion is strong forces joining water molecule to object then cohesion attaches a water molecule to THAT water molecule As long as cohesion and adhesion are stronger than gravity it will go up the napkin because of the water potential gradient.,askscience,cl5ezo8,1,t5_2qm4e2091001,0,t1_cl5ec5u,Yes by definition. Additional energy must be supplied from the gun or the pusher in order to exert the same force at a higher velocity and in return the object gains additional energy. Energy as usual is conserved.

Which is why it is kept in sealed containers the pressure of which is greater than atmospheric pressure due to the dissolution of CO to the point of equilibrium. If you cool down a bottle of coke youll notice it get fizzier. This is because the solubility of CO is reduced by reducing the temperature which also increases the pressure in the bottle because of this.EDIT  You know... I think Ive made this mistake before! Its because we degas solvents at low temperature. But the low temperature is just to stop them boiling when reducing the pressure and the reduction of pressure is what causes the degasification not the low temperature. Lower temperature decreases the rate of dissolution but not the solubility.The fizz over ice cubes is due to roughness as stated below.

Once the immune system makes the antibodies they are able to make those again faster next time they are infected they do not make all antibodies all the time leading to improved ability to detect and therefore fight the disease. Not all proteins are antigens. The most successful viruses coat their outer layer with nonantigenic proteins or with lipids to prevent the host immune system from recognizing them. In this case simply putting dead viruses in water wouldnt work. The key is figuring out which proteins on the virus lead to antibody production in humans and making that in to an effective  but still safe  vaccine. If you want to be specific you dont even need the whole protein to be antigenic  just a specific region of the protein known as the ectopic region. If the immune system reacted to any foreign presence youd be allergic to everything. The immune system if its working properly can figure out which proteins are indicative of a threat and react only to those. ,askscience,cl5srph,9,t5_2qm4e2092704,0,t1_cl5qsd3,No theres no minimal size to those disturbances theres a minimal action namely Plancks constant.To understand this think about swinging on a swing.

There has been no association since then with flu vaccines and as with most of the other side effects a child is much more likely to develop the condition as a result of contracting influenza.Due to the rarity of adverse events following immunisation its very difficult to prove that the vaccine actually caused the reaction. There are also a range of common and mild side effects associated with vaccination such as low fever aches and pains and swelling around the injection site.

See for example this map on wikipedia. Because primary producers are the base of the food web more primary production means more secondary and therefore tertiary production which eventually results in more fish production.To simplify primary production is higher towards the polls because there are more nutrients available. In the tropics there is a big temperature differential between the warm surface layer where primary production occurs because that is where there is light which powers photosynthesis and the cold deep layers. Some of the biomass which contains nutrients that is produced in the upper layer the euphotic zone sinks. This produces a net loss of nutrients to the deeper layers. Because of the greater temperature differential there is less mixing so the surface becomes nutrient depleted while the depths become enriched. However there is no primary productivity in the depths because there is no light. Closer to the polls the more similar temperatures between the depths and the surface allows more mixing and so less nutrient depletion in the euphotic zone and higher productivity.A more detailed explanation can be found here,askscience,cl6y7ib,3,t5_2qm4e2104915,0,t3_2j18ph,Thank you for your submission!

It has nothing to do with the speed of light. The reason smaller circuits are faster than larger ones is because the time constants in the circuits are smaller. The transistors are driving smaller capacitances and resistances. The fMAX of a transistor is a good figure of merit in determining its switching time. fMAX is roughly inversely proportional to Cgs which is the parasitic capacitance from the Gate to the Source. In a larger transistor this Cgs is much larger.

This organism is estimated to have lived between . to . billion years ago. This ancestral organism would have had to possess a set of predicted characteristics. Genetic code based on DNA.

Just the the lower you go the more likely you are to have all electrons in their normal levels rather than a few electrons in the higher energy levels.Interetingly this principle applies to all semiconductor devices. Image sensors for example are quite often cooled to reduce what is known as dark current or the random electrons that cross the band gap just through temperature related excitation. If you have access to a small sensor you dont mind potentially destroying trying taking it up to around C take an image then down as low as you can go.

Refer to this image The fertilized egg goes through a number of divisions and already has some basic specialization when it implants itself in the uterine wall. One of the first factors in cell signaling is after only a few cell multiplications as shown at day . Cells simply being in the center and surrounded by other cells is enough for various signaling molecules to differentiate these cells.On the topic of signaling molecules they can activate inhibit or do both to various genes. Lets say a particular cell at the front of the organism has a gene turned on that releases a signaling molecule. This signaling molecule will spread out from the cell in a gradient so nearby cells get a higher dosage than farther cells. If for example this signaling molecule interacts enough times with a neighboring cell a threshold will be passed and a gene will be activated or inhibited. There could also be a true gene product gradient if the amount of signaling molecules interacting with a cell determined the amount of times a gene was activated. For example each time a signaling molecule interacts with a cell the cell makes one new gene product. This is less likely in development because youre eventually trying to make a group of specialized cell i.e. an organ or tissue so it helps if there is a clear cut off for gene activation. A lot of these genes are only activated at particular times in development and then never used again for the rest of our lives.

First lets start with basic concepts.  Everyone has two copies of every chromosome with a few exceptions one from mom one from dad.  When mom and dad produce offspring they randomly give one of each of their chromosomes to their offspring.  Mom and dads matching chromosomes mix together and recombine a little and the offspring ends up with his or her own set of two chromosomes which are made up of moms and dads genetic material.  Lets say your mom has a random mutation on one her chromosomes that inactivates a gene which codes for a protein found in your eye.  This protein is required for your eyes to work.  Fortunately for mom she has two chromosomes and only one of them is mutated so her other chromosome is still able to provide the code necessary to produce the protein.  Hence your mom still produces the protein and is not blind.  Now your mom and your dad get together and they have a you a boy and your sister.  Your mom happens to pass on this mutated gene to both you and your sister  chance for each of you to end up with this gene.  Now you and your sister mate and produce offspring.  Because you both have  chromosome with the mutated gene you each have a  chance of passing on this mutated gene to your offspring.  Therefore there is a  chance overall  for you multiplied by  for your sister that your offspring will end up with both a mutated gene from you and a mutated gene from your sister.  If this happens your offspring has the mutated genetic code on both chromosomes and therefore cannot produce the protein at all.  Thus your offspring is blind.  If you were to mate with someone outside of your family it would be highly unlikely that they would have the same random mutation but you and your sister each have a  chance.  This is a simplified example of how inbreeding can lead to genetic defects.  Edit In response to your question inbreeding doesnt create genetic defects it leads to a situation where preexisting genetic defects are more likely to be present on BOTH chromosomes rather than just one chromosome.  ,askscience,clb7gnd,7,t5_2qm4e2135359,0,t1_clauakw,My B.S. is in developmental biology so I would like to add to your already excellent post.

Pieces from higher satellites would take much longer to slow enough to reenter and pieces from the highest satellites would remain in orbit essentially forever.,askscience,clf3dpj,8,t5_2qm4e2165662,0,t3_2jt9v5,Symmetry and conservation laws are useful tools in physics because they often let you figure things out about your system such as an equilibrium state in an easier way than by more direct but complicated methods such as figuring out exactly how the system gets to the equilibrium state from some initial state.Consider a much more intuitive system such as a ball resting on a Ushaped slope like a halfcircle or a parabola. Suppose that the system includes friction so that as the ball rolls it dissipates energy. We know that if the ball is given an initial velocity it will roll around for a while but eventually come to rest at the bottom of the slope. We know this because we can use the concept of energy. The ball can convert its potential energy to kinetic engery by rolling downhill but as its rolling its loosing total energy to friction and thus it cant roll back up hill as high as it started. We expect that as the ball rolls its maximum height will decrease until it eventually stops at the lowest point in the slope.Now you could have done the problem in a different way by calculating the exact path of the ball as it rolls by consideirng the forces that are exerted on it. You would be able to solve for the exact position of the ball at all times after you gave it its initial velocity and you should find that the final position after a long enough time will be at the bottom of the slope.You can now ask why the ball stopped at the bottom of the hill. Is it because the complicated series of forces which eventually pushed it to that position or was it because of energy conservation and dissipation? Of course both are valid explanations that use different mathematical tools. The first explanation is a dynamical explanation where you figure out how a system evolves over time and the second is a explanation that uses the concept of energy. If you take an upperyear classical mechacnics course you will learn that energy and energy conservation are related to an abstract kind of symmetry and so I would say that the second explanation takes advantage of the symmetries of the system.Back to your question about entropy and protein folding the situation is analagous. Its true that the shape of a protein is ultimately determined by the electromagnetic forces that the different atoms exert on each other and in principle it should be possible to calculate the shapes of proteins this way. Of course in practice this is stupidly complicated and not a very efficient way to figure out the shape. Ultimately you dont care how the protein got to the shape it ended up in you just want to know what the shape will be similar to the way you dont really care how the ball rolled to its eventual resting potision you just want to know what that position is. Similar to the way that energy is a concept that is useful in the study of mechanical systems entropy is useful in the study of thermodynamical systems. We were able to ague that the ball on the hill wanted to end up at the lowest point on the slope i.e. the point that minimized its potential energy. By using ideas of thermodynamics you can argue that a protein will want to end up in a position that maximizes its entropy.The point is that dynamical explanations are just as valid as explanations that use concepts like energy and entropy but the later are often much more efficient depending on what kind of questions youre asking.,askscience,clf3tju,8,t5_2qm4e2166240,0,t3_2juhik,Thank you for your submission!

It is roughly  compared to the aerodynamic loads at max loads.Current wind turbines have a constant rotational speed above rated wind speed  ms. So centrifugal forces do not increase above this wind speed. The aerodynamic loads also decrease above this speed because of the pitching of the blades to keep the torque and RPM constant.The reason turbines are capped at  ms is because of gusts. Gusts are proportional to the wind speed therefore at  ms the gusts are pretty severe and cause large peaks in loads.

MB of data is under M digits of either  or zero or to save timespace I would do a vertical line and a horizontal line on graph paper.At  wide by  deep you get  digits per page so you will need less than  pageseven with error correcting bits.Laminating  sheets of paper should not add too much cost and a smallish fireproof safe and a shovel would be good enough to protect it verses virtually any event.Now if you didnt have to generate the info yourself you could probably do it much cheaper by just printing out the  MB of data in some form on high quality paper and you could probably get it down to  sheets of paper. Which would basically be free. Then laminate and store in fireproof buried safe.Also If I wanted to guarantee it I would place it in multiple locations  should be fineOr even better for a relatively cheap method would be to pay a well known author to add  pages to the end of hisher book and then have millions of copies made of which many will survive  years. I imagine you can convince an author to do it for less than k plus whatever the extra cost would be for printing.If the goal is to do it for the absolute cheapest with a relatively guaranteed  year lifetime then I would speculate the best way would be to spend time finding the best way to propagate the data. if have multiple law firmsbanks store the data in independent locations to not be revealed until  years later to prevent potential sabotoge. This is a great question.Short answer I think I would be willing to bet at a  to  odds I could store  MB of agreed upon data for less than  dollars total.

It was pretty successful though presumably not as costeffective or as efficient as regular jet fuel at the time or they would be using it routinely but obviously all that work went back into RampD and there are some hydrocarbonbiofuel blends.If fossil fuels ran out tomorrow there are ways to produce hydrocarbons using electricity and as biofuels. You could certainly use these for longhaul flights but costs would almost certainly rise.Electricity could be provided from fuel cells which can be more energy dense than batteries. This would probably be most appropriate to domestic and shorthaul routes which cant be serviced by road or rail where relatively lowperformance electric aircraft can fill a niche role.

Certain cells such as macrophages neutrophils monocytes which turn into macrophages upon entering tissues and dendritic cells of the immune system are considered professional phagocytes because that is their primary role but others can perform phagocytosis as well. Additionally some pathogens can actually resist being engulfed or resist killing from the digestive enzymes and then escape the phagolysosome and replicate within the cytoplasm of the immune cell.

In the absence of gravity but the presence of atmosphere these planes would looptheloop until they either hit something or drag caused them to slow down and stop.Some paper airplanes arent gliders but are rather darts. These have roughly symmetrical airfoils behind their center of gravity and thus they behave like shuttlecocks  they follow a ballistic trajectory modulo drag.

Then we discovered quantum field theory and in this context GR does seem like an odd man out since its so unnatural to think of spacetime curvature in terms of quantum fields. Feynman then considers the perspective of a hypothetical alien species he calls them Venutians from Venus who discover all of the the quantum forces quantum field theory first. They understand the complete Standard Model Im updating Feynman here because his book is from the s and then they discover gravity. They naturally try to fit gravity into their framework of quantum field theory using the methods they know. It turns out that they are successful. Feynman considers the measurable experimental consequences of gravityGR and then attempts to build up various quantum field theories showing how certain attempts fail. Eventually he reaches the theory of massless spin particles gravitons as the simplest QFT which gives all of the correct predictions and then uses this as his definition of GR for the rest of the book which covers the standard material in a GR course from the graviton theory.

If you follow the link you will see that body size is also an important contributing factor in metabolic rate. In general increasing metabolic rate means having to eat more to sustain that increased rate. This means being able to find food more often and as there is typically less food available as temperatures decrease it is evolutionarily unfavorable to have or require high metabolism. There specific cases however which may interest you. Very neat case of emperor penguins for oneFor another this is the concluding statement from an old paper published in Science The results of the present work suggest that the more a system approaches the integration of a balanced ecosystem the less its respiration is affected by temperature. Such a hypothesis could be readily explained by postulating that within a highly integrated community where the physiological and geological cycles have evolved an almost complete interdependence the multiplicity of metabolic pathways assures the cyclic flow of energy and material regardless of the temporary closing of one or several pathways by temperature extremes. In a single organism or a group of organisms which are less well adapted to each other and to their environment the fewer pathways may be more easily affected by temperature. ,askscience,cm4oge1,2,t5_2qm4e2370502,0,t3_2mfcra,deleted,askscience,cm4patq,1,t5_2qm4e2372975,0,t1_cm4g40c,Exactly.

As truly massive stars age they run out of hydrogen and start to create shells of different elements around the core... oxygen carbon silicon neon etc. as heavier and heavier elements fuse in a desperate attempt to keep going. At some point this reaches a critical second where the star tries to fuse iron and the neighborhood goes bad. The energy needed to sustain fusion in iron takes more energy than it makes. At that second the core energy output can no longer balance the inward crush of gravity.  Gravity wins and the star collapses inward in a matter of seconds. The core is crushed rapidly. At some point this crushing phase reaches a critical point and a rebound occurs due to the sudden release of epic amounts of energy in the form of neutrinos as the core is crushed into  stupidly massive densities. It is this outward rebound shockwave which creates the supernova explosion. This outward compression shockwave wave compresses the matter and heavy elements surrounding the core fusing them into the heavier elements like gold and platinum blowing them out into space along with the rest of the debris. The denser the element is the harder it is to make and the bigger the shockwave needs to be. This is why heavy elements are rare. And since every action has an equal and opposite reaction the rebound explosion creates an inward crushing force as well and at that point the remainder of the core has only a few things which can happen to it depending on how massive the star is and the density of things. It can continue to be crushed only to a certain point where the crushing force cant overcome resistance and you get a neutron star. In a truly MASSIVE star say  times that of the sun the shockwaves is so massive it does overcome the neutron densitys ability to resist being crushed further and it keeps getting crushed forever.... Thus you get a black hole and theoretical physicists get headaches...or a show on PBS which I watch and hopefully describe the above correctly. ,askscience,cmbviao,13,t5_2qm4e2429056,0,t3_2n9a53,They do called the de Broglie wavelength Its a function of the electrons momentum.

Now allow me to get a little bit technical. Your heart basically beats on its own. The brain modulates the rate and force of that beating via sensory afferents which are integrated in a part of the brain called the nucleus solitary tract The NTS. The NTS receives information on blood pressure via baroreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid sinus These signals mediate the baroreceptor reflex modulation of heart rate and force of contraction in response to body needs. Afferent nerves in the carotid sinus travel via the glossopharyngeal nerve cranial nerve IX while afferents from the aortic arch travel via the vagus nerve cranial nerve X. As these are cranial nerves they are not within the spinal cord and not affected generally by focal spinal trauma. That being said the vagus nerve provides the parasympathetic drive to the heart. The sympathetic nervous system may exhibit control over the heart hormonally in the form of circulating epinephrine colloquially known as adrenaline or by inhibiting activity in vagal efferents at higher levels. Alternatively modulation may be conveyed more directly via cardiac splanchnic nerves which CAN be damaged by spinal injury. As stated previously the heart can largely beat without the brain telling it to do so although patients with spinal trauma may show cardiovascular abnormalities or pathologies and this may put them at further risk. These abnormalities are usually limited to the first two weeks after spinal trauma sourceRespiration is a little bit different. There are many parts of the brain which control respiratory pattern rate and rhythym. Notable among them is the prebotzinger complex preBotC if you were curious. The brain then sends the impulse to breathe primarily via the phrenic nerve. Unlike the nerves discussed previously the phrenic nerve does branch from roots of the cervical spinal cord in your neck specifically nerves exiting below vertebrae C C and C with C providing the largest contribution.Now to be quadriplegic you by definition have no use of any of your limbs so we will assume the damage is at the lowest point possible which still prevents all upper limb function. The nerves of the upper limb are collectively termed the brachial plexus which receives input from C C C C and T which eventually give rise to named nerves musculocutaneous axillary radial ulnar and median. Clearly based on C contributing to both the brachial plexus and the phrenic nerve there is a bit of respiratory activity which is mediated by a nerve that has ceased functioning in quadriplegics. However as stated The most important part of the phrenic nerve derives from C. That being said damage to C can result in problems with respiration although not always source Many patients who initially may require a ventilator may learn to breathe without the use of C.

The very early telegraph cables are inoperable because of insulation failures and breaks what we call external aggression.  The old analog coax cables actually had tubes in them.  They were super reliable actually had gold pins and anodes  they were beautiful.  I still have one and Id guess theyd still work if powered but the terminal systems what we call the dry plant on the shore are long since scrapped.The first optical fiber systems used regenerators  meaning the optical signal was detected converted to electrical cleaned up with filtering amplification and reclocking and then squirted back in to the fiber as shiny new clean bits.  Those electronics were very narrowband and carefully tuned.  The first optical fiber systems ran at . MBs per fiber on six fibers  East  West two active and one spare in each direction.  Of the . MBs only  MBs was usable the rest was for signalling overhead.  It could never be run at other than . Mbs and thats bits not bytes per second.  These are glacial speeds for this day and age so that kind of system is just abandoned.  Since the mids systems were deployed using Erbiumdoped optical amplifiers.  These can both transmit several optical wavelengths simultaneously but the the undersea repeaters are largely bit rate independent no filters or digital regeneration so you can change the speed by changing out the shore terminal equipment.

Jupitermass planets are much rarer around smaller stars than they are around solar mass stars. And stars bigger than the sun seem to host more and bigger giant planets.The general reasoning behind this is that small stars have smaller protoplanetary disks. Theres just less stuff around to make planets out of so its tough to get enough of it together to form Jupitertype planets. Neptunes and Earths are much more common around the small stars and that generally seems to be as big as it gets.

Asteroids are rocky andor metallic but they almost always contain water After all most of the water on Earth was delivered from comets and asteroids during the heavy bombardment period.  When the asteroid heats up from air compression pockets of ice and frozen carbon dioxide inside the asteroid vaporize creating pressure that has nowhere to vent.  These pressures can build up to exceptionally high levels in metallic asteroids with ice trapped within.  When the pressure finally overcomes the forces holding the asteroid together the result is a catastrophic rupture in the form of a massive explosion of steam and molten metal amp rock.

Lets pretend we have a constant thrust our fuel is massless the engine is perfect and so forth.gtIt outputs a constant amount of trust which would give it constant acceleration.This is the misconception that leads to the incorrect answer. The reason this is incorrect is in some sense very Newtonian. Ill touch on this in the end but try to keep this in mind as you read further.When were doing just special relativity  our metric is the Minkowski metric  we like to do physics in inertial reference frames. In such a frame an observer looks at the accelerating rocket and notices that its wordline is curved. In particular it notices that its relativistic mass is changing. This is definitional and Ill explain whyIll begin with a lightningfast introduction to special relativity. An inertial reference frame is defined so that the fourvelocity is constant. The fourvelocity is like the threevelocity youre used to thinking about only now it contains a timelike component because were doing relativity. If you look at the components of the fourvelocity theyre all multiplied by this factor of  gamma  That factor is the Lorentz factor which depends on the velocity of the object relative to an observer. As the object tries to reach c relative to the observer  gamma  goes to infinity. Maybe you can start to see where this is going.There are two force vectors we need to talk about. The first is F the fourforce that the rocket sees from the engines. The second is f the threeforce that tells us information about the actual acceleration of the rocket in the spatial coordinates. Notice that the fouracceleration A which is related to F by FmA depends on the three acceleration a. But a is directly related to f in the Newtonian sense that fma. All throughout this Ive assumed m is a constant because Im using massless fuel.Now when we fix the thrust F its true that we fix the force we apply to the rocket with the engines. Its not true however that the spatial acceleration a of the rocket is likewise fixed. In Newtonian mechanics the thing resisting acceleration is the mass of the object. You probably know this from experience pushing a box full of textbooks is harder than pushing an empty box. However in Newtonian mechanics you can in principle apply the same spatial acceleration forever. Mechanics in special relativity differs from Newtonian mechanics here. In special relativity accelerating an object becomes increasingly more difficult as it speeds up because its relativistic mass textmrelgamma mrest  is increasing and this is the thing that the threeforce the term we called f sees. In order for the spatial component of A  gammabfubfagammabfufracbfacdotbfucbfu  to remain constant a must go to zero as  gamma  goes to infinity and a is the spatial acceleration of the rocket. In short weve fixed A but we did not fix a. Thus the rocket does not keep accelerating spatially at a constant rate despite the application of a constant thrust by the engines. Indeed a will approach zero as the speed of the rocket approaches c.You may be wondering why we cant fix a. The reason is this A what we call the proper acceleration is the fundamental quantity. Its the true acceleration that the engines apply to the rocket. Its the thing we have control over. Its the thing accelerometers measure. You cant get a uniform a without an infinite force.NB Physicists dont like talking about the relativistic mass of an object because its frame dependent and because it comes from treating the fourmomentum like the threemomentum. Physicists like frame invariant things like the rest mass what we now just call the mass. They also like to distinguish the properties of the fourmomentum from the threemomentum. I appreciate and agree with these points but I think for the sake of brevity its better to talk about relativistic masses here than to get distracted with the nature of fourvectors and so forth. Suffice it to say that rockets dont actually gain mass and relativistic mass is conceptually misleading. The math is all the same but the interpretation differs. The utility of the above explanation is in the analogy to Newtonian mechanics.,askscience,cn6t3y8,11,t5_2qm4e2667863,0,t1_cn6t7fd,deleted,askscience,cn6tbk0,20,t5_2qm4e2668000,0,t1_cn6t7fd,deleted,askscience,cn6tyob,19,t5_2qm4e2668208,0,t1_cn6usuu,There are an infinite number of them.

I think I agree with that  its not exceptional that these things work the way they do rather they work the way they do because we choose those workings as useful. And thats another good point I suppose I do sound creationist. Im slow to say you mightve totally changed my thought on the matter but your point is really convincing.I suppose in a sense mathematics must be invented since it all comes up from ZFC axioms and if we take a broader approach ours is not the only mathematics there has ever been. But then again hasnt math been not so susceptible to Kuhns revolutions? Euclid picked up a thread that were still following today. The concept of parallel lines is borne out of nature  arent we just starting there and following the logic where itll take us?If we talk about it in terms of a knowledge production then consider mathematics research compared with say art criticism. Art criticism is  invented  its the product of critical minds thinking about art and then responding to others ideas about art. But math isnt like that so much. When the world receives a mathematical paper it cant usually these days be critiqued or refuted or called outdated. Math production has always seemed to me as this worldwide effort to solve a puzzle. I do agree that for some very axiomatized branches of math esp. linear and abstract algebra we are inventing and then finding the useful elements. But maybe for analysis its a bit more inspired more exploratory. We are given the reals and then told to figure it out and from there we pull out properties and from there derive relations between properties.

There are other factors like currents moving effecting ice formation the Antarctic circumpolar current is a good example of this and the Gulf Stream which warms the North Atlantic and keeps the UK and parts of Canada from getting as cold as they otherwise would as well as ice formation being a negative feedback loop where ice reflects solar radiation and thus less energy enters the system to counteract the formation of ice.

The far end of the rubber band will be moving away from you at the fastest speed. The point next to your feet will barely be moving at all. On the other hand if you were standing in the middle of the rubber band both ends will be moving away from you at the same speed. So the speed of expansion depends where you are standing and what you are looking at.

The standard idea behind integration is to sum up a lot of smaller and smaller pieces to get better and better approximations of the area like this When the length of these pieces tend to zero the sum will tend to the correct area and this limit is what we call the integral.This is why the integral sign looks like an S. Similarly if you want to compute the length of a given curve you can and I would say possibly must do that by splitting your curve into smaller and smaller straight lines like this As these pieces become smaller and smaller the limit will again turn into an integral.From a pure mathematical viewpoint you have to do something like this to be able to define what we mean by the length of a curve. How else could we define it? I mean sure we can both agree how long that straight line is Ill just pick up my ruler and measure it. And if your curve is just a bunch of straight lines put together also no problem. We can both agree that the length is then the sum of the length of these straight lines. But what if your curve is actually curvy? How can we then come to an agreement on how long it is? One possible way is to fetch a string put it down along the curve cut off the ends and then measure it. But if you want to turn that into mathematical rigour things quickly get messy. How do we know that we do not change the length of the string by bending it? How can I make sure that you didnt fetch a rubber band to do your measuring? These questions arent easy to answer when we dont have a way to measure curvy things yet.Another far mathematically simpler and cleancut way is to define the length of a curve as an integral. As we both agree on what the length of a bunch of line segments are what if we just cut our curve up into line segments? And then we can surely agree that if these cuts are made smaller and smaller the length of all these line segments must approximate the real length better and better. And voil we have an integral.

The human body does have the capacity of sensing oxygen deprivation in the carotic arteries and aorta but the respiratory drive is usually dominated by the CO sensing system which severely desensitizes the oxygen sensors to the point of almost no functionality. However if the central CO sensing system gets deactivated  atrophied for example in the case of late stage COPD the oxygen sensing system takes on an active role to the point that the respiratory drive is primarily driven by oxygen. In fact people with this condition should be treated with caution when supplying with external oxygen as the surplus of oxygen might incapacitate the respiratory drive  in other words the person stops unconsciously breathing and may suffocate as a consequence.Interestingly even in healthy people oxygen deprivation may actually cause a reaction that is usually not directly perceived. While CO accumulation hypercapnia leads to the very strong sensation of dyspnea oxygen deprivation hypoxia may lead to euphoria.,askscience,cnhvhp9,2,t5_2qm4e2761277,0,t1_cnhnrnl,Place the mirrors in orbit and have the mirrors be operated by individual craft.

This is how noise canceling headphones like the ones produced by Bose operate.However that cancellation is only at a specific location or set of locations and doesnt cover all of space. This is because the sound wave is still there its just being masked by another wave at the same location. The only way to ensure that the wave is being canceled everywhere is to have the oppositephase source in the same exact location as the original source which is impossible.That said you often only care about the sound in a certain location like how noise canceling headphones only cancel the noise around your ears.

The reason why requires a quick foray into statistical thermodynamics.But the basic idea is this liquid water is already the lowest energy state at room temperature. If you rearrange the molecules into a different configuration this would necessarily be a higher energy configuration and the system would try to relax back to the lowest energy state which is liquid water.That said the speed of relaxation is not always fast. This is the reason why annealing and quenching are so important for metalurgy. For many metals especially Iron Bronze and Copper the preferred state at room temperature is relatively soft and malleable. This is great for shaping the metal into whatever device you want. However you can make the metal transition into a more brittle state by heating it up and thus rearranging the metal lattice then quickly cooling it. In theory the quenched metal should gradually approach the annealed state but in practice this would take more time than we can measure at least on the order of millions of years.Here is the statistical thermodynamics explanationAll systems try to increase their entropy. In truth entropy is just a measure of the number of microstates a given setup has. For example if I had a pair of dice I would expect their sum to be  as that is the most likely macrostate in other words the macrostate with the most associated microstates. In the case of dice  is only moderately more likely than other outcomes. But as the number of dice or atoms in the case of an extended material grows the probability that you are close to the average case grows very quickly. In statistics this is called the Law of Large NumbersNow I have argued for why all systems should have lots of entropy. Why does high entropy mean low energy? Its because there is more than one way to divide energy. In addition to the crystal arrangement energy there is also radiation lattice vibrations or phonons dislocations and so on. Most of these other methods for splitting up energy have higher entropy than whatever exotic crystal structure you may be thinking of so the thermal energy will end up in one of those states instead.I have tried to keep this discussion as nonmathematical as possible and I may have explained things incorrectly as a result. If you want to know more I strongly recommend taking a course on statistical thermodynamics.,askscience,cnjtxqw,2,t5_2qm4e2777988,0,t1_cnjr8b8,Scale from one to ten how scary are some of the pox viruses you get to work with in the lab?,askscience,cnjuj4q,0,t5_2qm4e2778775,0,t1_cnjmkjm,deleted,askscience,cnjxr81,0,t5_2qm4e2778913,0,t1_cnjwgqv,deleted,askscience,cnjybjw,190,t5_2qm4e2779352,0,t3_2rv68l,deleted,askscience,cnk046w,1,t5_2qm4e2779921,0,t1_cnjzl35,Well theyre not exactly foreign proteins theyre misfolded versions of endogenous protein.

But if you heat something itll expand  like the gas in a hotairballoon. This expansion of hot gas is what keeps gravity from compressing the star further. At a certain point in a stars life the fusion in its core dies out because it takes a lot more energy to fuse larger atoms together while at the same time the energy released becomes lower. Therefore the stellar core cools down and theres less internal force that counteracts gravity. In a normal star  one thats not undergoing supernova  the balance between the internal pressure of the hot gas and the pressure of gravity acts like a thermostat keeping the fusion rate roughly constant  for some reason fusion rate decreases the core cools and compacts  but if its more compact fusion rate increases again if the fusion rate increases too much the core heats and expands thus reducing the chance of two particles colliding and undergoing fusion rate decreases again,askscience,cnl2gtu,6,t5_2qm4e2789206,0,t3_2rv68l,deleted,askscience,cnl4frg,1,t5_2qm4e2789921,0,t1_cnkvd6c,We are watching for this right?,askscience,cnl7cvm,3,t5_2qm4e2790124,0,t1_cnkla5y,Regardless of the length of time that is required for the nova to occur internally wouldnt the nova as observed from earth occur very quickly?

OP is asking for damage on liver and paracetamol has a VERY significant effect on the liver when compared to aspirin. In the liver some of the Paracetamol is metabolised into NAPQI. NAPQI is usually metabolised into mercapturic acid rapidly which is nontoxic but when too much paracetamol is taken NAPQI accumulates in the liver which covalently bonds to the liver destroying the cells.Aspirin is metabolised in the blood into many different products but mainly salicylic acid.

These include lactose galactosemaltose and starch and they were reported to be less effective than either sucrose or glucose the latter was similarly more effective than fructose considering that glucose is utilized by the cells in the beginning followed by fructoseThis is not to say that it is effective if applied directly to your outdoor or soil garden microorganisms would utilize the sugars much faster than your plants roots. But to be clear there is very compelling evidence that the statement by udblowe is inaccurate.

Because of this in the far future stars will cough up more planets including planets that are small and rocky like Earth. Quote from articlegt Despite the diminishing rate of star formation perhaps half or two thirds of all the planets that will ever exist have yet to be born.In addition stars will be smaller because of less available hydrogen to form new stars. Smaller stars are not a problem though for life the habitable zone will just be closer to the star so in the far future the universe will be more hospitable for life because there will be more habitable planets. Quote from articlegt At first the proliferation of planets does not seem promising for life. Most of the stars of the far future will be much less massive and less luminous than the sun. Fortunately even a lowmass dim star can allow life to flourish. A star with as little as one onethousandth of the suns luminosity can maintain temperatures that allow liquids to exist on closein planets satisfying what seems to be a requirement for living things to exist.And moregt Planets should not only grow generally more common but also be enriched in the stuff of life. In addition to requiring a liquid bath life on Earth as well as almost all other forms of life that scientists speculate about depends on the existence of carbon nitrogen and oxygen. As time goes on the increasing relative abundance of these elements should yield planets more hospitable to life. Therefore as star formation steadily diminishes every newborn star should appear with a progressively greater probability of lighting one or more potential lifebearing planets. Some of these new stars will have the low masses and tiny luminosities that allow them to last for hundreds or thousands of billions of years not that such immense lifetimes seem necessary for the origin and evolution of life.

I remember that to outside observers nothing seems to manage to cross the horizon but rather freezes as it tries to do so. Wouldnt the point of their center of mass similarly cease to move towards the center too? And since the black hole is made from mater falling into it atleast to outsiders nothing reaches the center. There is some result I think about Newtonian gravity that moving inside a hollow sphere will not experience net gravity and outside of it you can condired it as all being at its center as far as gravitation goes.As you move inside the black hole the horizon seems to retract nearer to the center. And the in falling matter seems less frozen in time. Woulnt it be possible in principle to accelerate with enough fuel past everything that has fallen into the hole before you? that way eventually the horizon will reduce to a point and then vanish.

So like... gt hash gt compare to hashed password gt hash gt compare to hashed passworduntil you find the right one. The hashing part takes some time though so in certain instances people use pre computed lookup tables. People have made giant tables where they have computed the hash of every possible password. To prevent this some hashing algorithms include what they call salting which makes the hash more unique. E.g. WPA wifi networks salt password hashes with the name of the wifi network. This way even if two WPA wifi networks have the same password they have different hashes. Now hackers have made those same giant lookup tables for the top  most common wifi network names. Which is why when comcast or ATT installs a wifi router now they set the network name to something unique like your address instead of ATTNEWROUTER like they used to. This way a hacker trying to brute force your WPA password has to compute the hashes of ever possible password for your semiunique network name instead of being able to look them up in a table they downloaded. This can take years without access to serious computing power.

Eg. cells like that of the brain or even heart cells dont divide as much as say hepatocytes liver cells or lung cells. So the likelihood of them getting a mutation is less than these other types.

In fact its the field Im doing my doctoral research in.The study youre referring to was a nice demonstrator of the impact of diet on epigenetics which is the overlay of instructions on top of our DNA that tell cells which bits of underlying information to read and how often  its what stops nerve cells turning on genes for hair production for example.  The study removed a vital chemical needed for applying these instructions from the mothers diet during pregnancy.  As a result some of the epigenetic markers werent added during development which permanently changed how these variable genes were turned on and off.  Adding the chemical back in during development solves the issue.This study is nice because it shows an overt single impact with the removal of a single dietary component but life isnt so straightforward and these single issues are very rare.  What we see in everyday life is developmental response to diet and maternal health throughout pregnancy.  There isnt necessarily a standard setup  the fetus adapts its development to be in tune with the environment in the womb whether that be the womb of a healthyeating exercising fit young woman or the womb of a highfathighsugar diet consuming sedentary older woman.  Looking at offspring of obese or diabetic women or women who lost lots of weight between pregnancies we can show that offspring of these women are much more likely to be obese and develop metabolic or cardiovascular disease than children from healthy mothers.  We dont see the same associations if the father is obese suggesting the impact is passed by the mother.Its hard to dissociate the individual contributions of diet i.e. eating an unhealthy highfathighsugar diet from the contributions of the metabolic status of the mother i.e. obesity or malnourishment in humans.  However in animal models we can see that Giving overweight monkeys a normal diet just during their pregnancy tends to protect their offspring from the detrimental impacts of their mothers overweight suggesting overnourishment itself produces many of the adverse adaptations Giving mice antioxidants tends to protect their offspring from maternal obesity suggesting inflammation caused by maternal obesity is a contributing factor too. Genetically altering mice to produce more of their own Omega s also tended to protect their offspring suggesting composition of diet and antiinflammatory nutrients might reduce the impact of maternal obesity. Giving mother mice different types of fats in their diets during pregnancy changes how their offspring develop fatty liver disease in later life  giving margarine doesnt increase the risk but butter does.   Giving an anti diabetic drug metformin to obese mothers also protects their offspring.  This is the field of my research not this particular group mind  whether we can limit the effects we see in offspring of obese mothers by giving a demonstrably safe well known drug during pregnancy.This review is an excellent overview by two of the leaders in the field if you fancy a chunkier read.

This concentration will depend on temperature pressure what else is dissolved in the water and the oxygen concentration in the air. Surface area doesnt change the final concentration of DO you reach but will change the rate at which you get there. The more surface area the more opportunity for oxygen to cross from the air into the water so the faster it will reach equilibrium. So if you measure right away you might see a difference but given enough time both should reach the same DO point. Caveat  Im assuming youre in open air the oxygen that goes in to the liquid doesnt affect the amount of oxygen remaining outside to any meaningful degree. This is true if youre outside or even in closed room but if you only had puffs of gas sealed in a container with the water you might see that depletion of oxygen from the air has an effect on the equilibrium.Big Caveat  I ignored the fact that you mention putting the same amount of material into the small or large water volumes hence why I wrote short answer to headline. This means that in the smaller volume of water you have a higher concentration of stuff dissolved and concentration of other stuff dissolved can affect the DO. So the answer in that case is that yes if you put the same amount of material in different volumes of water this could affect the DO reading of the water because the fertilizer in this case would have a different concentration. As to what is higher or lower will depend on the chemistry of exactly what that fertilizer is and hard to predict without knowing. ,askscience,coa0ibh,3,t5_2qm4e3010301,0,t1_coa02iw,Ill just reply this one time because this often is raised and Ive replied to these accusations before which frankly is offtopic to the matter at handChristian as I am Christian.Defence as I love discussions about life philosophy including those pertaining to Christian thought.

In the vast majority of animals there is absolutely no negative consequence of vaccinating when the animal already has high titers against a pathogen. However there is a possibility that the repeated irritation caused by the adjuvant the vaccine is mixed with can increase the likelihood of cancer. To my knowledge this has only ever been proven in cats In response vaccine makers have started making vaccines that dont contain adjuvant to prevent any sort of repeated irritation.

The reason for this is that vaccination allows your body to mount a rapid strong response to a particular antigen.  Booster shots basically work by poking the bear to keep it active.  Once youre vaccinated repeatedly injecting more of that antigen can provoke an overreaction at the site of injection.However... This is not a problem for somebody getting lots of different vaccines because the immune system is being exposed to a variety of antigens and not the same ones over and over.

Why introduce something entirely new and unrelated to i to be the square root of  when the complex numbers already contain  square roots of ?Heres the deal the complex numbers are really nice. Theyre even nicer than the real numbers. The are superior algebraically. First they maintain all of the nice basic algebraic properties of the arithmetic operations over the reals commutativity associativity and inversion of both operations and distribution. Second and more importantly we can factor every single polynomial over the real or complex numbers completely into linear factors or equivalently every polynomial has exactly n roots counting multiplicity. This is huge by simply adding i to the reals we dont just get square roots for  or just square roots for all negative numbers or just roots for all quadratic polynomials or even just roots for every real polynomialwe get all of the roots for every single polynomial we can imagine.The complex numbers are also superior geometrically and analytically. Although the real numbers have the nice property of having an order that respects the arithmetic operations the complex numbers can be identified with the Euclidean plane and we suddenly have all of the tools of plane geometry at our disposal and it this geometric representation of the complex numbers is intimately tied into their algebraic properties. Furthermore calculus turns out to work even better over the complex numbers than it does over the reals. For example every complex differentiable function can be represented by power series which is not true over the reals.In short the complex numbers are really nice and we dont want to leave them if we dont have to. Since  already has a square root in the complex numbers we have no reason to toss in another thing to be its square rootwere just messing with perfection.So what does happen if we throw caution to the wind and add an additional element say j such that j   and j is not a complex number? ucafeanons comment showed that we have to throw away some algebraic property if we want this to happen. If we assume commutativity and no zero divisors then were forced to identify j with i. To avoid this we have to sacrifice commutativity accept zero divisors or both. In the first case we get the Hamiltonian quaternions in the second if I recall correctly the result is a split algebra and in the last we get an algebraic object equivalent to x matrices over the reals. The first and last of these are particularly nice objects to work with and certainly have their applications but theyre frankly not as nice as the complex numbers.,askscience,cod43mq,2,t5_2qm4e3040387,0,t1_cocyhsn,The three initial crops of farming wheat maize and rice all formed on three river valleys.  One in Asia one in America and one in the middle east I believe.  I think with the accumulation of resources and fighting for those resources there was need for a ruler and people wouldve deferred to the smartest person to make the decisions and be the selected ruler.  Peoples with strong humans better weaponsmaybe they were longer maybe the stones that much sharper and a smart leader could defeat competing peoples some of these people might have joined up with their opponent when they lost this increased size of the close quartered group.  I believe agriculture came out of observing the environment and basically putting  together and because of this increase in group sizeas people have already said larger groups make for more ideas and more things to remember.  Someone else pointed out that we dont have any indication of rulers or dictators or kings before the accumulation of resources and I believe thats because humans didnt need it.  I believe everything that developed in human culture even some of the tech for today are things humans need to survive in the environment at the time.  Because agriculture developed globally and not just locally it would imply that there was a global reason to grow crops and to me the only one that makes sense given the about of work primitive farming wouldve been was population density increase and climate change.If you think about this in the context of modern society as humans develop and get smarter and we still maintain this choose the smartbestbetter suited leaders strategy for dividing up resources its no wonder in todays time thier is civil unrest revolution war etc.  There are enough smartbestcapable people who can convince other people they can do things better than the person in charge.  Consider the declaration of independence and the constitution separation of powers etc. They give the power to voice your opinion elect new leaders etc. its an evolved form of past ruling its what humanity needed.  Think of modern dictators and how the people that are subjected usually rebel.  I believe that as long as humans are on this earth things that happen in human society the developments are purposeful.  ,askscience,cod4utb,1,t5_2qm4e3040391,0,t3_2uxmsf,deleted,askscience,cod4vcl,1,t5_2qm4e3041176,0,t1_cocythg,Also an Alcubierre drive would still allow for time travel if you could use it in the way people actually want to.

When the electrons jump into the conduction band they are free to move around because they are no longer bound to the donor atoms.

Infact it has been observed that the timescale at which the separation occurs is at least much longer in space since this was an experiment run on the ISS for outreach purposes it was not let sit until separation so we dont know what happens in the long run. It is entirely possible that the temperature at which kinetic energy dominates over the energy cost of mixing is at or below room temperature in freefall although I have not been able to find results in the literature studying this citations would be appreciated.I completely disagree. I think its clear they have made an emulsion and not a solution since it scatters light. The stable state of an emulsion will be bulk phase separation. Interfaces are never energetically favorable except maybe block copolymers or things like that.

Every light switch actually called a transistor has three wires attached the sink the source and the flip. The source Ia always wired to positive voltage and the sink will connect to the ground. The switch when powered causes the voltage to pass through to the sink. This lets you turn anything on or off shortened to  or .You build these switches aka transistors in a variety of ways but the common approach today is to take a layer of silicon on its own electrically neutral then add impurities of boron or lithium iirc please correct in comments which make sections either electrically over or under charged. The wires are typically gold and now there are holes and peaks in the silicon for electricity to jump around. Anyway once we have  and  we can start using boolean logic. The simplest boolean operation is not which takes the input signal and flips it. So if the wire coming in has voltage high the wire going out will have low and vice versa. There are twobit gates most commonly and and or. If both inputs to and are high you get high coming out. If only a single or neither are high low comes out. You can combine gates as well take the output of and and feed it to not and you have nand which behaves just about as you expect!The next thing we need to add to make a processor is some kind of arithmetic.

In some sense you witness this every time you drop something since gravity is a manifestation of spacetime curvature. The production of gravitational waves however usually requires much more massive and energetic objects in order to be noticeable.I was actually referring to the subject of strongly interacting quantum field theories. Quantum Field Theories describe our current understanding of particle physicsHeres an analogy Imagine watching water waves calmly hitting the beach. If the waves are far enough apart its pretty easy to talk about this wave or that wave without too much confusion. But if you were in the middle of a violent storm in the middle of the ocean with water blowing all about it wouldnt make much sense to talk about single isolated waves.The same situation can happen in particle physics. In fact this is happening all the time inside of a neutron or proton. Its typically said that neutrons and protons are comprised of three quarks although this is only approximately correct. In reality the quantum state of a proton is a very complicated one and it does not correspond to a definite number of quarks.

Newton just picked examples he could solve geometrically.He wrote the  Principia in the style of Euclids elements.  Newton thought that Euclidian geometry was perfect wellproved math whereas the nascent calculus was suspect and prone to being questioned.

The reason that you seemed to see a whole lot more of them is that theyre most visible when you are A looking at a blank monochromatic surface or B looking at a bright light.  Looking at a blank surface allows you to more easily pick out the visual distortion of the floaters.  Looking at a bright light causes your pupils to constrict which makes the floaters less blurry and more distinct.  Normally people report an experience like yours when looking up at a bright clear blue sky.  But looking at a whole bunch of tanning booths would do the trick too.,askscience,cojn3qa,8,t5_2qm4e3104112,0,t1_cojisnm,Well the softer the material the easier the drilling mostly. Fine silt thats highly micaceous though puffs up to the point where it seems like twice as much comes up out of the ground that what there should be. When you have to shovel spoils out of your way its a bit tiring. Running sands are probably the trickiest. Sand can have so much water in it that it flows. When youre drilling with hollow stem augers it wants to flow up into them. Took a lot of headaches to figure out how to drill that. When Im coring rock I think limestone is the easiest. It pinnacles so you can go in and out of it as you go down and you have to exercise extreme caution but when coring with wireline I have the barrel spinning as fast as it can go and can hear the rock sing. Excellent moneymaker there.  But the easiest drilling is moist coarse silt. It isnt packed too hard in the ground its so soft I can almost push augers into it and backfilling is quick and easy.editgrmmr,askscience,cojqngc,3,t5_2qm4e3104714,0,t1_cojfps0,In our human experience freezing is almost always associated with water phase change due to lowering temperature.

This is different from the random human cancer which first needs to be diagnosed and maybe sequenced to understand exactly what youre dealing with. The mouse though? Oh hes p KO  it says so on the box. I dont have to spend years figuring out which set of mutations predisposes one to this type of cancer which proteins are messed up. Its easier to hit a target you picked.Obviously we cant design the human to have certain genetic or immunological flaws. Or maybe its a virus? Or some workrelated exposure to odd chemicals. Some get lucky at diagnosis oh I recognize your mutationsyndrome from this database and theres a drug that addresses this exactly but others dont.We might do it just as easily in humans if we were willing to pump them us? full of random chemicals and see what works but were less willing to damage and outright kill the necessary hundreds an experiment might take. And were less tolerant of sideeffects in humans  if a mouse doesnt fall over there are no lesions on autopsy and fertility looks ok this is a success. But who really knows  perhaps its done something to the quality of life of the mouse that would only be apparent if its lifetime were extended something years.Ive been reading recently for example that a common acne medication might or might not be associated with inflammatory bowel disorder   We can afford to risk this in rats  were far less willing to do the same thing in humans.

Helioseismology studies have shown that this differential rotation continues deep within the sun all the way down to the bottom of the convection zone. Below that the sun is rotating at the same rate at all latitudes. The transition region from full differential rotation to zero differential rotation is called the tachocline and it is very thin  only about  of the suns radius.

I belive I have an answer.When any two tones are played a third tone is produced and heard alongside the first two.  The frequency of this third tone is the difference in Hertz between the frequencies of the first two.  This tone is often called beats because of the beating pulsing sound it makes when the first two tones are almost the same but slightly out of tune.  If the first two tones are carefully chosen the resulting tone can be a musical note.When a chord is played beats are produced between all the notes of the chord.  Both the notes played and the beats they produce are heard together.  What makes the chord special from any random group of three notes is that the beats produced are themselves notes in the chord from other octaves.When you play a chord beats are created between the notes which cause you to hear not only the chord asplayed but also the chord in a myriad of other octaves all at the same time.I must admit I have only tested this hypothesis with the Cmajor chord.

So far I can find bipedal Ostriches taller than humans with vertical necks and with absolutely stunning poundforpound leg powers.Kangaroos are bipedal and Id suggest are mostly upright when breathing and while Im sure they might have need to select a weaker throat muscle gene to go from their previous ancestors they didnt give up animal strength. Indeed Kangaroos are frightfully strong poundforpound even in their surprisingly humanlike arms with decent motion range.But here Id have far less trouble with your explanation IF the difference in strength came down muscle grouping or even length of muscles. But so Im told the reason chimps and other animals are much much stronger than humans isnt size density or length or even biomechanical attachment and leverage but to them having unique and much strong muscle fibers woven together. And its like that with most any other animals but us. and no it doesnt seem obvious that a week ape that can stand upright would have any good advantage over apes X stronger and this has been tested about  times in recent times where Chimps Vs Humans. Humans despite their locomotion and ability to see further from a higher difference didnt just lose any kind of battles but were absolutely EASILY smashed as prey with their faces genitals eyes and even their feet removed by chimps. Easily.So EVEN IF I accept weaker muscle fiber mutations get selected because it allows the ape to stand upright based on observation that just means a slow moving weakling thats popping its weak little neck above the grass before something half its size advertizing it wants to be smashed by just about any other living thing half its size. ,askscience,copg0ez,-5,t5_2qm4e3159455,0,t1_copggc8,deleted,askscience,coph4mc,0,t5_2qm4e3161226,0,t1_copnl68,For most physical processes its useful to assume so.

Pions are used in a simple model of the strong nuclear force if you dont want to get into what protons and neutrons are made of.Most stable baryons are made up of two quarks the up quark charge  and the down quark charge . A proton is uud charge  while a neutron is udd charge . A pion will take an up quark and a down quark and trade them at the same time again this means that one of the quarks is going to have to travel back in time and become an antiquark. Pions are therefore either upantidown or downantiup. Since charge changes sign with antiparticles these make up a positive pion and a negative pion.There are also upantiup and downantidown pions neutral which make neutrons interact with other neutrons and protons interact with other protons.Remember that the whole gluon thing is all going on inside each proton each neutron and each pion while this is happening.

What isnt the same in all frames of reference are durations between events.  So if you measure the duration between two events to be one Planck time and then compared that measurement to one made in a different frame of reference the duration measured in the other frame might be less than or greater than one Planck time.  But the value of a single Planck time would be unchanged between frames just like the length of one metre is the same.gtso if you were travelling at some arbitrary value close to c an outside obvserver of your system would be able to observe you infinitely slowly and thus work out if time were quantised to any great degree or not?Sadly no  that observer would merely see the duration between two events become arbitrarily long much longer than one Planck time.,askscience,couze2t,2,t5_2qm4e3213718,0,t3_2wvvp9,Its been a while since chemistry... but Ill give this question a shot.

If you keep adding energy to some solid eventually there will be enough energy so that the molecules can overcome some the van der Waals forces between them and separate from each other. Thus stronger forces will cause higher melting points. For example ice has a melting point that is higher than would be predicted purely from its molecular mass  thats because the hydrogen bonding that exists between water molecules is relatively strong.,askscience,cov3pw2,1,t5_2qm4e3215590,0,t3_2wwlmm,It might help to think of it first in terms of the domestication of the wolf. Suppose there is a genetic component which dictates how far a wolf will get to another species without responding with flight or flight. Wolf A might respond with flight or flight if it is  meters from another animal say humans. Wolf B might only be  meters.If there is some benefit for a wolf living closer to humans like eating scraps then we would expect for the population of wolves with those genes to be found near humans.The situation is somewhat mirrored on the side of humans. Humans that have a flight or flight response of  meters will not let any wolves near them with lower responses. But if there were some humans whose flight or flight responses matched that of the wolves say  meters then they could live in closer proximity. If there was some benefit to humans say the wolves kept away certain predators and pests then wed expect humans with those genes to let wolves with similar flight or flight responses closer in.Over the course of time we might expect these humans and wolves to live closer and closer together especially if there was some benefit for both.To make a few guesses about plovers and crocodiles it is doubtful that crocs have much of a flight or response to most birds but rather they have a how close till I try to eat it response. The ancestor to the plover might have scavenged leftover meat from a crocs dinner. The birds that got closest to the crocs had access to more and fresher meat and this increased their survival. The crocs that did not go after the birds might have had some survival advantage. Maybe the birds would eat the meat before it rotted. This might have given them an advantage because rotting meat was probably a large warning sign to the crocs potential prey. So although they missed a small potential meal without the rotting carcass to worry about they were able to get a much bigger meal.Over time the Plovers flight response gets shortened and shortened while the crocs eat response gets shortened as well. It gets to the point where the Plover can get close enough to pick left over meat out of the crocs teeth without their flight response being triggered and without the crocs eat it response being triggered. This ends up with an added unexpected benefit of increased hygiene in the crocs teeth.I may not have explained this well I certainly didnt use the right terminology. My guess about how it happened might be wrong especially since the plover crocodile relationship might not even exist but I think that gives the basic idea of how something like this would happen.Here is a source about the domestication of the dog.,askscience,covaqbq,1,t5_2qm4e3216422,0,t1_cov16k7,So its not so much a shell being filled more a field which becomes stable given the forces at a given distance from the nucleus?,askscience,covdu62,1,t5_2qm4e3224437,0,t1_covxwmc,deleted,askscience,cow7szv,1,t5_2qm4e3225335,0,t1_cowaxes,deleted,askscience,cowb62g,1,t5_2qm4e3228631,0,t3_2x3znr,Thank you for your submission!

Let me explain.Mathematically dimension is defined to be the number of numbers you need to fully describe something. For example to describe the size of a sheet of paper you need two numbers the length and the width ignoring the thickness of the paper. Therefore we say that the paper is two dimensional. In three spacial dimensions three numbers are necessary. That is to describe the size of a box one needs the length width and height.Now if we include time we see that we need four numbers. We not only talk about length width and height but we also talk about how long something has existed. So for our box we say that it is  foot by  foot by  foot by  week meaning that it was made a week ago. It is in this sense that time is the fourth dimension. This should more or less make sense. All were doing is just deciding to provide more information.The weirdness is that time doesnt quite get treated the same way as space.In space we measure distances with the Pythagorean theorem. For example in two dimensions lets say you walk from your house to a friends house down the street and on the other side of the road and pretend that the road is straight and flat for simplicity. You will walk a certain distance down the road. Lets call that distance x. You will also walk a certain distance across the road. Lets call that distance y. Now suppose instead of walking down the road and then crossing it you take the shortest path and walk directly from your house to your friends house cutting diagonally across the road. Lets call that distance d. Then the Pythagorean theorem tells us that d  x  y. In relates the straightline distance d to distance moving along one way x then the other y.Now if their house is up a hill along our straight road then you also need to account for the height upward that you walk in the distance between the houses and lets call that upward distance z. The the distance between your house and your friends house in this case is d  x  y  z where x is still the distance that you would have walked along the road if there were no hill. This is the three dimensional case where we talk about x and y being the distance along a flat D surface then include z the distance above that surface.Now suppose we want to include also how long it took to make the walk. Then we would now be measuring distance in four dimensional spacetime. What distance means in this case is harder to understand but we can still talk about it mathematically. If lengths of time were just like distances of space then we would say that distance in spacetime is d  x  y  z  t where t is time. However this is not correct because if it were we could move through time like we do space. Instead what Einsteins theory of relativity tells us is that for distances in spacetime d  x  y  z  t. Instead of adding t we subtract it. And that makes all the difference. That minus sign when you work through the math is what implies that you can only move in one direction through time. The entire theory of special relativity ultimately boils down to that one minus sign.You may have heard that in general relativity space and time are bent by planets and stars. All that means is that the numbers appearing in front of the x y z and t in the above equation can be different. For example the number in front of the t can change depending on your height above a planet. At a given place and time near some planets and stars you might have something like d   x  . y  z  . t. However note that time will still always be subtracted. This dependence of d on position and time explains why we feel gravity though explaining why those two things are related is a somewhat difficult and long job well beyond the scope of the initial question.,askscience,cp06g7p,8,t5_2qm4e3263694,0,t1_cp03sqx,deleted,askscience,cp0akty,1,t5_2qm4e3263707,0,t1_cp02mku,To expand all mass is energy.

So long as the charge of the particles electrons and protons in the case of matter positrons and antiprotons for antimatter is the same and the mass is the same then the spectrum produced will be the same.  this movement of charged particles is why hot things glow increased temperature means increased movement which gives us light.The second source of light is the release of discrete wavelengths of light when an electron drops from one energy level to a lower one.  This energy creates the discrete emission lines that is unique to each element since the energy difference between levels is different for each element.  So long as the attraction between a positron and an antiproton is the same as electron and proton then these emission lines should be identical.TLDR no they should look the same to my knowledge.I kind of rushed the answer here since I have lecture to get to in  minutes but hopefully that made sense.,askscience,cp21wky,1,t5_2qm4e3279270,0,t1_cp162rm,FYI you can do triple asterisk for bold and italics.,askscience,cp22a77,3,t5_2qm4e3280007,0,t1_cp23f5y,Reread the question.

The magnet magnetizes the metal in the  pence coin making it a magnet while it is in the presence of the magnetic field of the permanent magnet.Longer answer All magnetic fields are caused by moving electric charges. The electrons that are in all atoms carry an electric charge. These electrons orbit their atoms and they also in some sense spin. Both of these effects cause atoms to have small weak magnetic fields.Usually all these weak magnetic fields are pointed randomly and cancel each other out. In some cases in some materials it is possible to get large numbers of atoms to all have the magnetic fields align. The special materials that can do this are called ferromagnets.A common way to make a permanent is to take a block of a ferromagnetic material and put it in a huge magnetic field. This large external field will cause all the internal atomic magnetic fields to align. Then when you take your block out of the field a given atoms field will be locked into place by the surrounding atoms fields.Now a similar thing happens with your coin. When you put it in the field of that magnet all the atoms fields align and it become magnetic. Then it sticks to your  pence piece which in turn becomes slightly magnetic.Because the field from your permanent magnetic is relatively weak and because the atoms in the coin are jiggling around a lot it doesnt hold the field very much when you take it far enough out of the field.An experiment to do would be to cool down your coin a lot. A freezer might be sufficient Im not sure. Then without warming it up so you certainly cant touch it with your fingers touch it to your permanent magnet. When you take it away now it might be able to hold its own magnetic field better and you might get it to stick to things well away from your permanent magnet. Thats because when its colder the atoms are jiggling around a lot less and are more easy to force into alignment. When it warms up or even when you knock it about too much the atoms will be jiggled back into their random positions.The reverse experiment is also possible. If heat up a permanent magnet a lot such as by boiling DONT PUT IT IN THE MICROWAVE the atoms will jiggle around and be able to break free of their uniform locked position. The atoms will then jiggle into random positions and the magnet will lose its magnetism. When it cools back down the atoms will still be in their random positions so the field will not recover and youve ruined your magnet.,askscience,cp2nnef,3,t5_2qm4e3285914,0,t3_2xpje8,There are two possible reasons for this. First it could prevent the plume from hitting the hull which is likely to reduce efficiency similarly be noisy and possibly damage it.The second effect and possibly main reason is that it introduces a certain redundancy.

Because the two devices are running at the same power they are both adding the same amount of energy to the system to a good approximation your house in a given unit of time and ultimately virtually all of this energy will effectively end up as heat. In this sense the internal structure of the device doesnt particularly matter for the sake of this problem you can just treat them as block boxes that put out that much power. From the point of view of heat generation it doesnt particularly matter that your computer is a complicated system internally at the end of the day it puts out heat exactly as though it was essentially just a big resistor like your heater. The same goes for your light bulb or for pretty much any other appliance operating at that power. The only small difference in the case of a light bulb is that if there are windows or other openings then part of the emitted flux will leave your house and thus wont contribute to local heating although this energy will also eventually be dissipated as heat elsewhere. However all of the light and infrared radiation that bounces around the house will ultimately be converted to heat and thus will again be equivalent to the heating caused by a simple heater.,askscience,cp3q352,319,t5_2qm4e3295385,0,t1_cp36otc,Yep typo.

Additionally the ground under the water is probably not frozen as the frost layer is usually only a meter or so deep. Heat transfer will continue to happen but eventually the groundwatericeair system will come to a stable state and the ice will remain constant thickness. Colder weather will result in thicker ice. Lake ice can easily get  or more feet thick. Also a shallow pond that is not much deeper than the frost layer can freeze solid.

As we know light moves at the speed of light haha tautology! so the term with mass is .  But light has energy. We know that on a basic level because of things like chemical reactions that produce light always go from high energy molecules gasoline etc to low energy molecules water or CO. So energy is being carried away from the reaction in the form of light.So the left side must be a positive number if light has energy. Therefore the momentum term must also be nonzero.Specifically Ehv so phvc. The argument in English that goes with special relativity is then this. All things that have energy must by definition have mass or momentum or both.

The first is measured by two angles and a range distance.  The two angles are celestial latitude and celestial longitude.  Celestial latitude is the measure of the angle of the orbiting body relative to the ecliptic plane of the central body and celestial longitude is the measure of the angle from a primary direction like the vernal equinox to the orbiting body.  The range for your purpose would be the radius of the orbit at a certain point in time.The second main method would be a rectangular coordinate system defined by a vector of three dimensions like radius  xyz.  This system would probably be easier to code because it is an inertial frame and doesnt require any coordinate transformations.  The downside is that it requires numerical integration or iterative Keplers Equation solving.  The good news for your purpose is that the orbits for all the planets are well known so all you really need is a point in time to start from and all the orbital information at that time semimajor axis eccentricity radius vector etc...Just my last two cents.  This topic orbits and orbital mechanics is often taught as upperdivision university courses and for many people the learning curve is steep but once you get over the initial hump its a very fun topic.

For example Ive readheard multiple reports saying things like when two particles are entangled changing one particle changes the other. This is simply not true in the slightest.In QE you have two or possibly more separate particles that are effectively part of a single quantum state. Say you have a process that is guaranteed to generate pairs of photons with identical but random polarization. For any given pair you can be certain that their polarization is the same but you dont know what the polarization is. You can then send those photons off in different directions until they are separated in space.What QE says is that if you then measure the polarization of one of the photons at one location you will be guaranteed to get the same result if you measure the other at its distant location. Making one photon decide what its polarization is instantaneously decides the polarization of the other.That might sound trivial given that we knew all along that they had the same polarization right? The thing is at a quantum level when we say the polarization is random we dont mean that it was decided when the photons were generated and we just didnt bother to check. We mean that at a very fundamental level the polarization of the photons is completely undecided until it is measured. Until that moment of measurement the photons quite literally have all possible polarizations. It is thus still kind of spooky that measuring one instantaneously causes the universe to lock down the polarization of the other.As you can see though all you find out by measuring one of the pair is what the people on the other end will measure when they get around to it.

With a conventional automatic thats not true.

This is why a conventional automatic will roll forward while idling in gear. Since the s or so automatics are also equipped with a clutch called a torque converter clutch which locks the engine output shaft to the transmission input shaft so that less energy is wasted in the torque converter but this only engages once you are already moving at a decent clip.The torque converter is what allows the car to stop in gear.

The rocket is accelerating constantly however as it approaches the speed of light  in their example the speed stops increasing and just gets closer and closer to  no matter how much time the ship spends accelerating. Essentially the energy of acceleration goes into altering your perception of time and space rather than simply increasing your speed.,askscience,cpm3lr4,1,t5_2qm4e3455504,0,t3_2zq9q7,To add on to this question is there any way of knowing how rare or common this situation is throughout the universe?

More complicated answer The waterfall itself isnt falling at one speed the water droplets are accelerating as they fall. However air resistance and collisions would become a major factor pretty quickly and some kind of terminal velocity would be reached. But this would be changing all the time for each droplet through based on its size how well it was holding together running into other parts of the waterfall rocks etc etc. Probably theres some kind of average behaviour and mathematical model of a waterfall thats at least possible if not already worked out.,askscience,cpmfzc5,5,t5_2qm4e3459585,0,t3_2zur4x,What youre missing here is the reason we cant travel faster than light. Its not an issue of a lack of efficiency fuel or power something science could develop or improve. Special Relativity tells us and we have many measurements to confirm it that the faster you go the more energy it takes to go a little faster. So the closer you get to the speed of light the more energy you need to speed up. It gets harder and harder to speed up unt for anything with mass to reach the speed of light from a speed slightly less than the speed of light would take an infinite amount of energy.,askscience,cpmm9re,10,t5_2qm4e3461457,0,t1_cpmtmtj,Wow thats amazing.

Science is the models that best describe reality. Its not reality itself. Many even argue that reality has no real inner core hidden from us.

The zerogravity effects would be the same for spending a year on the ISS or a year on a space ship going to Mars. This includes bone and muscle loss fluid redistribution throughout the body and a host of other related health challenges. The effects of radiation are very different for a Mars missions and being on the ISS. For the ISS astronauts are outside of the protection of the atmosphere but still within the Earths magnetic field so the health risk from the increased radiation is minor. For a Mars mission astronauts would also be outside of the Earths magnetic field and thus the risk from radiation is much higher. Note that radiation would also be a threat for surface activity on Mars because Mars does not have a global magnetic field and its atmosphere is very thin. For more on the effects of microgravity and radiation see here and hereIn my opinion coming up with a way to protect astronauts from harmful radiation is the largest technological hurdle that must be overcome to enable a mission to Mars. Most of the other challenges could be resolved with current technology or technology that will soon be available simply by investing enough money. To my knowledge there is not yet a clear solution to the radiation problem with current or foreseeable technology although there are a lot of ideas and people working on it. I should also add that there are a few other health differences between a Mars journey and the ISS. First the psychological impact may be larger for a year long trip to Mars in which you know you are millions of miles from home with no hope of returning in less than several months in the even of a contingency. In contrast on the ISS the astronauts are a few hours away from Earth in the event of a contingency. This also clearly has huge implications should a medical emergency arise. Lastly the communications time delay would become significant  min. for a Mars journey such that live conversations with familyfriends on Earth would become impossible which may also affect the astronauts psychological health.,askscience,cppri1r,2,t5_2qm4e3487239,0,t1_cppjbjb,So no more memory engrams?,askscience,cpprqxe,1,t5_2qm4e3487735,0,t1_cppt5cf,Muriatic is usually the name in the hardware store because it has been the name longer than the systematic name.

Oneness and interconnectedness and so on are really vague concepts that have no significance in physics. Its human nature to search for patterns so you can look at physics and eastern religion and western religion and literary criticism and anything else and find some semblance of the search for interconnectedness in all these fields. It doesnt necessarily mean anything useful for the science.I havent read the book Dancing WuLi Masters so I cant really say anything about it specifically but again I suspect it would be silly to expect it to make sense as a physical argument.

The more you make this observation the more reliable this statement becomes.Also the state of progress can be taken into account. Now we need to look at how much A has progressed already. Say we know that untreated A is deadly. We simply record a lot of health parameters of the patients and thus get a storyline what A does to the patient and how it progresses. With a new patient we get this data and compare it to the averaged out story lines we recorded in the past. Since we cant treat A we can at least spot where on this storyline of A the patient currently is and how much time is left to the typical end. In technology there is equations for this like the MeanTimeBeforeFailure and similar. On a very abstract level people are like spare parts that fail according to predictable patterns.Only difficulty might be to spot in the absence of exact data the progression of A in the patient or take into account crossinfluences from for example other ailments or detrimental habits such as smoking thatd kill off the patient earlier. But doctors are trained for that specifically. Also I guess they often give an optimistic outlook as giving a pessimistic number will get the spirits down and if you take peoples hope they sure die very early.,askscience,cppznbg,2,t5_2qm4e3489382,0,t1_cppuyt5,gt Firstly no doctor should ever be saying You have x amount of time to live.

Sometimes people are told exactly what you say but dont get it so the doctor summarized. When asked later they might say I have  months to live.

As to the CO part of it Im assuming your asking this because on earth CO is a very small percentage of the atmosphere yet contributes to climate change. CO is linked to temperature increases both today and historically but this is because of our atmosphere the reradiation of thermal radiation and the relatively long period of time carbon stays in our atmosphere.

So if a study maintains that married women have fewer affairs than married men there would need to be more unmarried women who have affairs with these men.

After the big bang the was universe made up of hydrogen helium and a bit of lithium sprinkled on top. Heavier elements wont come until stars fuse them together during their lifetimes and elements heavier than iron when they go supernova.So the very first stellar systems would not have any of the rocky planets that we observe today. No solid moons comets or asteroids. Gas giants like our Jupiter could have formed though.That being said heavier elements would form relatively quickly after the formation of first stars. Very massive stars burn out very quickly. An Otype star measures its lifespan in millions of years.

If you go into a gravitational well and come back out you literally have not aged as much and we can measure this easily with GPS satellites which need to take this effect into account to work properly. It is a common misconception that relativity of simultaneity time dilation and other effects of relativity are just optical illusions caused by the finite time light takes to travel places. They are real effects and you dont technically need to mention light at all to describe them. Light does not have to exist for these features of relativity to work. There are also new optical effects on top of those but the basic time dilation stuff has objective consequences. The thing you are calling time and the thing a stationary observer are calling time are differentits like two people calling different directions forwardand so the statement that you measure things differently is totally sensible because youre not measuring the same thing. ,askscience,cpwdx3e,5,t5_2qm4e3545912,0,t1_cpwg9bq,deleted,askscience,cpwgg8p,1,t5_2qm4e3547320,0,t3_30x20y,Would you please include a sample paragraph of scientific writing one version passive and one active?

I think a wellwritten title is essential to attracting an audienceand the right audienceto your papers and talks.  I have two main rules for titles  .  Keep them shortunder  words if possible.  Twelve is about the number of words a readers eyes can take in while scanning down a list and nobodys going to remember more than about  words anyway..  No introductory fluff.  Get the important key words at the beginning of the title so theyre on the top line and along the left margin.

Some lizards instead detach tails but hey if ur quick and you can stay a tail length away fitness bonus.I prefer a different scenario. The tail no longer impacts fitness in a significant way. Natural pressures are ambiguous on the tail. Mutation has led to populations of tailless beings live peacefully amongst the tailfulls. Then an enviormental change occurs all of a sudden tailless monkeys are being selected for somewhere in close proximity to where the tailless live. The tailless thrive and eventually diverge significantly from the main branch.One last thing I want to point out dont fall into the trap of saying that because so and so animal didnt need so and so part it like fell off or something.

Some people with synesthesia mentally recolor black and white letters into colors based on what letter they represent. However to my knowledge they only use the standard colors you can get from mixing the three primary colors.If you would feed a brain a new sense data stream it would try to copmherend it from scracth. Thus it would aquire a look and feel appropriate for that kind of data which is very unlikely to be colorlike.The maximal chance to make the brain aquire a color look and feel fo rthe new data woul dbe to have it appear in the context of visual information or have a task that is rewarded for very visual stimulus like calculations. Those could be doing shading and lightning reverse calculations. If one were to stick a extra camera attuned to different wavelengths than natural eyes then the received data would pretty much be interpreted visually in away because it is visual data given adequate integration and getting used to the standard sense.I have practised some echolocation and I made a cool transition where I abandoned stereo type pointed hearing and achieved a D volumous understanding of the auditory respondce of my surroundings. That is a significant portion of the look and feel of seeing but unluckily its not the color part of it. Because of my lack of familiaritytraining my texture information was very crude. Why for example windows present them very differently via echolocaiton than standard walls the feel difference was more tactile or sound like. While there was a correspondence an occasionally differences to the echolocaiton information and visual information I still concieved them separately ie an object would be red and hard not a shade of hardred.I see your question as two parts. Can brains be made see new colors? and Can brains be forced to replace perception of one color with the perception of another color? The latter part seems uninteresting and weird question to me.Unfortunately echolocation demands some mental concentration. While I was motivated to whether it is possible and what it feels like I was willing to put in the effort. However since I have gotten very rusty as living a visual stimuli guided life kinda supresses the attention the other sense are getting and my question already got answered. After all most humans do not accidentally pick up echolocation the way that they pick up smelling or tasting. There are plenty of blind people that understandably have the skill honed much better but those could not provide helpful answers to this curiocity as many of them have not had visual color perceptions and thus cant compare even subjectively whether they are similar or not to their auditory experiences.In theory an objects echo responce would not need to be uniform over all frequencies. Thus different objects would ring as slightly different notes  colors and thus genuine sound color would exist to be percieved. However the timing resolution accuracy to uphold a D view instead of a stereo one is usually something that is beyond the untrained ear. The ear would need to be able to compare the relative volumes of two notes that are heard simultaneously to pick up on the color. Its pretty easy to identify which musical instrument is playing even if they play the same note that is after all the attractiveness of having differnt instruments in the first place but echo responces are very likely to be very much more subtle. The auditory world is probably way more grey and differences of small shades than the visual world.Its also interesting that while we have  visual color receptors we additionally have a broad spectrum noncolor receptor. At least for me it seems very whiteish when it could be a color of its own. The reason might be that on good lighting conditions the standard colored perception dominates and the broad spectrum signal is unlikely to give any addiotionalcontradictory information than the combined color perception. However in dim lightning both systems might be on somewhat level relevance. However humans tradiotionally dont spend that much time in that kind of conditions. One could also deliberately try to make two lamps one that maximally stimulates the colored perception while tyring to minimize the broad spectrum responce and a second lamp that tries to minimise the colored responce but maximise the board spectrum responce a clear cut is hard because the frequencies overlap so much. In theory the brain has enough sensory data to be able to grow to recognise colored white light from noncolored whiteligth. Propably the whites would not stay looking the same way and a creation of a fourth color channel is likely. One could for example be in an otherwise black room with only one lamp as the light source which would be randomly switched to one of the white lamps every  minutes or you could have one lamp for each white with alternating periods of which lamp is brighter. Otherwise this could be carried out by anyone that volunteers their time for such it helps that you can do reading or your normal stuff while under the conditions just as long as it doesnt involve light generation so reddit via a standard monitor would be ruled out but the light bulbs would need to be custom made. There might be some color differences in ordinary lamps but generally being colored is considred a fault in them so its unlikely to by chance to find a lamp pair with signficant enough white types difference which would still have the same white balance on the color cells.,askscience,cq1h18e,0,t5_2qm4e3590853,0,t3_31gmgv,This happens due to the influence of the sun and the moon called Earth Tides not the same as water tides but is more due to the reshaping of the Earth rather than the pull of the object itself.

We can follow them through the body and too specific receptors. We can test their affinity at those receptors but how those receptors influence the perception of pain and consciousness as a whole is poorly understood beyond they reduce it. I tried my best but the vast majority of data on desomorphine relates to clinical use rather than method of action. The issue is that it was deemed as less effective than morphine not due to potency but the much shorter duration and larger side effects with no practical medical use and made illegal and as such there was very little reason to study it in significant detail. Its potency is very likely tied to higher lipid solubility although again I was unable to find specific values or greater protein binding etc allowing it to cross the blood brain barrier more effectively resulting in greater concentrations in the brain or just simply having a greater receptor affinityefficacy once inside the CNS. Receptor affinity is how likely a given concentration is to trigger a receptor and efficacy is when that trigger occurs is it a full trigger or a partial trigger. Even a minor change in a molecules structure can have a large influence in its receptor affinityefficacy.   Unfortunately this is a very broad speculatory explanation simply due to how little information I can find on the drug. The small structural change could have a significant effect on both its ability to cross the blood brain barrier and its receptor binding. It seems logical the increase in potency is weighted towards better crossing of the blood brain barrier as suggested by the faster breakdown... morphine is metabolised primarily in the liver and an increased ability to cross the blood brain barrier would mean desomorphine reaches the brain at increased concentrations but also leaves the brain faster as the liver breaks down the desomorphine in the rest of the body.

Thanks,askscience,cq7rj5d,2,t5_2qm4e3645130,0,t1_cq7r2pt,technically yes its beyond the speed of light. space can expand faster than the speed of light which is why galaxies are redshifted and explains certain things like how a warp drive would actually work IRL but light itself and in fact the matter carried within that space wouldnt move relative to the space it is contained faster than light. Its a weird concept to grasp imagine two stickers on a balloons outer surface. as the baloon inflates those stickers move farther away. they arent really moving relative to their location on the balloon but as the baloon exapands so to the distance between stickers expands. except in this case the baloon is empty space and the stickers are two massive objects. by the time the expansion of space overcomes gravity that space is expanding faster than the speed of light.

By adjusting the pupils diameter your eyes can take in just the right amount of light to accurately measure whats around you.

We are not physically placing the object in our eyes. Light can come from an object in two ways. Either the object can reflecttransmit light that was created by some other source or the object can emit its own light. For reflectiontransmission the color of the light that enters our eyes is a function of both the color content of the original light and the reflectiontransmission properties of the object. So the light that you see coming from an object does indeed contain some color information about the intrinsic properties of the object but it also contains information about the color content of the light source. That is why to see an objects true color we shine white light on it which is a combination of all visible light colors. It takes intelligent human brains in order to separate out the intrinsic object color information from the light source color content information.For instance a standard orange fruit has the color orange. If you shine a purely blue light on an orange fruit it will look black. But our brains are usually smart enough to realize that the orange is not really black its just that the original light is not white. Note that an object does not really have a single true color. Even if we assume perfectly white original light shining on an object the color of an object can change depending on its temperature structure and shape. For instance liquid water in large volumes is clear with a faint hint of blue. Small drops of liquid water such as in a cloud are white. For emission such as from a light bulb or candle flame the color of the light depends only on the object and its state. In this case the light coming to our eyes is  composed of information about the nature and state of the object. But note that the color content of the light emitted can change depending on the state of the object.

The process of naming species can be quite complicated but there are a few general things to consider Previous literature How has the classification of your group changed over time? What is the taxonomic history? This information will become important further down the line when you get to the actual naming component. The last thing you want to do is give a name to something that has already been described synonymy. Material What is the distribution of your species? You need to be able to account for any possible natural variation across their ranges so your taxon sampling should ideally be dense. Oftentimes you can get large quantities of material from museums and personal collections. Species Concept How do you personally define a species? The types of analyses you conduct will depend on what criteria you feel are important or diagnostic. In the past decade or so theres been a push to move beyond a single species concept and to adopt a more integrated approach using multiple lines of evidence to reach a wellsupported conclusion. Analyses If you employ an integrated taxonomic approach youll need to test various species criteria. You could ask for instance  Do they form distinct genetic clusters and if so do they occur in sympatry?  Do they inhabit unique sets of ecological niches?  Are they any diagnostic morphological characters?  Is there reproductive isolation? The list goes on and on. Some approaches will be easier to use than others. Judgement Once youve analyzed the data and the literature you need to make a judgement call. What is the bestsupported classification for your group? It is almost never clearcut nor unanimous. Naming Once you have decided upon a classification you have to give names. These names have to follow a strict set of guidelines such as the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature. This is where knowing the literature is important. You cant give a new name to a species that is already described that name has seniority or rather is the senior synonym. Description You have to write up a formal description of your species including how it can be distinguished from related forms where it can be found etc. Types You should designate a series of individuals that you based your species description on and deposit them in a museum. This is primarily for future studies of the group. Having a record of exactly what is considered a particular species is vitally important.,askscience,cqsp3sw,4,t5_2qm4e3828852,0,t1_cqsnf3i,This is the right answer.

If you look at what elements living things use youll see that the most common elements used are also the most abundant elements in the universe. Because theres so much of these elements around life is more likely to generate out of these elements. Life will also evolve to use common elements because that makes growth easier.Chemical properties also matter in ion systems and coordinate chemistry. Youll find that free metal ions in living things are usually light alkali or alkali earth metals. They are good at staying as a solution in water and are able to carry electrical charges easily since they are not heavy. For example two of the lightest ions sodium and potassium are used for cell gradients. Other transition metal ions are also used because they can have lots of different oxidation states and can thus react with proteins to form useful chemicalmechanical complexes. For example iron also super common due to terminal fusion in hemoglobin will change oxidation state if bound to oxygen and change the shape of the whole molecule to absorb more oxygen.You may wonder why lithium helium and silicon arent used. Lithium is relatively rare due to how stars do fusion and is also hard to come by since it reacts so easily with oxygen. Helium is a noble gas and doesnt react with anything and is rare on earth since most of it floated into space. Some organisms use silicon but it is so different from carbon and so similar to carbon at the same time that accidentally using it with carbon basically breaks some things.Tldr Metal ions that are easy to find on earth are used because its easy to find and use them. Metal ions that do useful things like act as electricity carriers are used because they provided an advantage to organisms. Some elements dont follow the rules due to specific properties or because they arent found on Earth much.,askscience,cqx8lzr,4,t5_2qm4e3868469,0,t3_34qyxy,Thank you for your submission!

Definitions of health are tricky.    Men in my family have been rugged in their younger years say under  but have issues of late onset diabetes heart problems and other ailments in their older years.  Do you call them healthy?  If their kids follow their path do you call the kids healthy?. There are physical factors genetic amp epigenetic. There are social amp economic factors.. There are cultural  national factorsTrying to sort out these often conflicting factors could be an exercise in chaos theory.Here are some quick guesses.. Definitions of health are tricky.  Lets replace healthy with successful  prosperous.  Look at the most successful  prosperous people and see if there is a link in age of parents at time of giving birth.  I assume older parents tend to give children all kinds of social economic educational and other advantages.  I assume studies would find that children of younger parents have less prosperous and less healthy lives.. There are physical factors genetic amp epigenetic   Egg and sperm CAN be damaged with age and exposure to toxins.  If you do not get one of these bad outcomes or if it is recessive and not expressed you have all the benefits of older parents without the physical drawback.. There are social amp economic factors.  My experience is that there are more young parents in situations of poverty.  Poverty is a significant predictor of health in infancy and childhood.  Smoking and poverty are also significantly linked and the smoking and poverty of the parents will cause many problems for the children.. There are cultural  national factors.   This comparison between USA and Canada for various issues of health shows that a border makes a difference.  Canadians are slightly more likely to be smokers.  Americans are way more likely to be obese.  My assumption is that poverty which is linked to age of parenting magnifies these affects for that part of the populationAssuming your folks have helped you with education and a stable home single biggest predictor of child poverty in Canada is parental divorce you are way better off with older parents.,askscience,cqxzbuy,4,t5_2qm4e3875455,0,t1_cqxxuuj,deleted,askscience,cqy1a34,1,t5_2qm4e3875524,0,t3_34sijg,deleted,askscience,cqy1k9j,1,t5_2qm4e3876122,0,t1_cqxxgi1,deleted,askscience,cqy40o8,3,t5_2qm4e3877743,0,t1_cqyab8y,In our  dimensions there are ways to determine distances and such.

We turn our heads to look at things because we have a narrow field of view. Radar is similar  it only gets information from in front of it and so needs to be turned to look at everything around it. You could however build an onmidirectional radar. It would put out a pulse in all directions and then listen for reflected radio signals from all directions. But there would be two big issues Youd not get in an normal radar design any information about what direction the detected object was in. You could tell how far away it was and how fast it was moving towards you but not at what angle it was. You could add this information by having a group of antennae that effectively triangulate. Youd need a lot of power as unlike a normal radar youd be sending the radio power in all directions. If you didnt give more power youd have a much weaker return signal and thus a harder time to detect small or distant objects..Edit bullet points ftw,askscience,cqyyvws,7,t5_2qm4e3883787,0,t1_cqyryz5,Why not at perigee instead of apogee?,askscience,cqyzgun,1,t5_2qm4e3887128,0,t1_cqz5gtj,Open source.

The main principle with KAr dating is that Ar is a gas so if you have a liquid magma or lava any argon present will just leave before the lava or magma cools and forms crystals. This means that at the time of crystallization there will be no argon in the crystals. Potassium is very common and will be present some of the potassium will be radioactive and will disintegrate into argon.

But it also depends on the stereo and if the tone adjustment is in the preamp or after it. If you are talking about a stereo with physical knobs. Usually that are passive components a potentiometer and a capacitor that just attenuate the signal in a certain frequency range as you turn down the knob. But depending on the overlap of frequencies between low mid and high you will get some nonlinear affects in the in between frequencies. For example is low is like hz mid is hz. So as you adust the low and mid the frequencys around hz will not change the same amount as those around hz or hz. So there is one way that its not exactly like just turning up the volume.Another is if you push the preamp into saturation. This means that as you increase the level of a particular range it may reach the max amplitude of the preamp and you end up getting some interesting affects. If you have an older tube amp than you get compression as you get close to saturation. Compression compresses the higher amplitude parts of the signal reducing the decibel difference between the highs and lows See this Some people really like this others dont But if you keep going to far you end up with straight up distortion which is only good if you are trying to recreate the Who on your guitar amp. Newer solid state amp will just clip which ultimately will just sound like shit.

Super capacitors store large amounts of charge in what is known as a capacitave double layer around an electrode.  These electrodes must be highly porous in the nanoscale to allow diffusion of ionic charge carries through double layers and adsorbing to electrode surfaces to transfer charge electrons.  Actually now that I think of it capacitors are actually MUCH more robust than a typical battery.  Many can be reenergized millions of times with little wear.

This results in a shifting of the water on the surface to be aligned with the moons gravity the tides and also a daily reshaping of the Earth that we as humans dont notice but can detect.Then you consider what happens when an elongated object due to the moons tidal field tries to rotate through that field. The aligned configuration is closer to equilibrium than having the long part of the planet aligned perpendicular to the tidal field so theres a torque that tries to keep this alignment and resist this rotation. This is called tidal friction and it is very slowly slowing down the rotation of the Earth. The same effect is responsible for the moon being tidally locked to us.Now if the Earth starts to slow down its rotation its angular momentum will increase. But angular momentum is conserved so the moon getting farther away in effect increases the orbital angular momentum to compensate for the loss of spin angular momentum.Now I havent read the recent internal wave paper yet but generally these effects are enhanced by the squishiness of the planet e.g. its ability to realign its structure under a tidal field.,askscience,cr22vhm,3,t5_2qm4e3913283,0,t1_cr2c8ha,deleted,askscience,cr2clbv,1,t5_2qm4e3914064,0,t3_3569v1,deleted,askscience,cr2fsge,1,t5_2qm4e3914572,1,t3_358jy2,The basic idea is that metalloids such as silicon can behave both like metals and non metals i.e. conducting or nonconducting.

This energy is in the end what is captured by the earth and the plants and the solar cells to turn into other forms of energy. There are two reasons why the temperature in the Himalayas is still lower First of all the energy of this beam does not really depend on how far it has traveled. This because the air does not absorb a lot of its energy. The energy density will slightly decrease since the rays are divergent but comparing the height of the Mt. Everest km to the average distance from the earth to the sun M km this effect will be negligible. So the energy of the rays is the same at both positions However energy is proportional to pressure and the pressure decreases with altitude. This because temperature is nothing more than the average velocity of the particles. With more particles more particles will bump into you and in this way transfer energy to you. This is why in the Himalayas its cold.So for your second question its not so much friction friction is not really the right word between the rays and air its between the rays and more solid absorbing surfaces these surfaces will transfer the heat to the air which will in turn transfer it to you.,askscience,crg77q7,4,t5_2qm4e4034935,0,t3_36psn6,There is no such thing as an amount of space that has to be conserved.,askscience,crg7oir,1,t5_2qm4e4036178,0,t1_creg7v9,Yes but its more complicated than this.

You could for instance use peltierelements to cool solid structures and let the heat away through conduction or radiation. Doing so is a lot less efficient than using helium but in principle possible. Hydrogen can also be used for cooling down to K or so which may be enough for some applications. The main problem is that cryogenic hydrogen is a serious firehazard in the case of leaks.You can also do things like having a small cooler with a minimal amount of helium in it and partially freeze nitrogen into a slurry of liquid and frozen nitrogen for transporting heat to the element that does the cooling. All of these techniques have costs and limitations associated with them and preserving our helium reserves is likely to be the more cost efficient solution but at least in principle we are not completely screwed if helium becomes unaffordable.,askscience,crh5jq4,12,t5_2qm4e4045146,0,t1_crh9y31,Yeah I was a little overenthusiastic and answering the general question of can helium be recovered and OP was specifically talking about a quench which is definitely a rare and specific circumstance.,askscience,crhdl06,2,t5_2qm4e4046743,0,t3_36uun5,deleted,askscience,crhk5o9,1,t5_2qm4e4046900,0,t1_crhkolf,deleted,askscience,crhksy7,1,t5_2qm4e4047090,0,t3_36vq2m,I am pretty sure a b and c are explained by the fact that this is actually two separate explosions spliced together for the gif without any fade or other way to separate the explosions.  has the same two explosions but in the reverse order.The blue stuff is likely an aurora effect,askscience,crhll3x,11,t5_2qm4e4047266,0,t1_crh8nmt,deleted,askscience,crhmb5u,1,t5_2qm4e4047314,0,t1_crhj3mw,Oh sorry.

All our eyes know about a grouping of light though is how much of each of our three different cones are being stimulated the state of this system can be represented as a  dimensional space with one dimension for each cone type. Conveniently this is the number of spatial dimensions or in any case how many our brains naturally use to represent space so its easy to think about and draw this space but thats just by coincidence nothing special about the number . And the mantis shrimps experience of that same grouping of light the shrimp having  different types of cones could be represented in a  dimensional space.One consequence as uAxelBoldt pointed out is that information is lost there is necessarily more information in the higher dimensional space than the lower dimensional space with respect to combinations. Same as how the same exact  dimensional photograph could be produced with many different arrays of objects in  dimensional space e.g a large sphere far away a small one close up. So in uAxelBoldts example of yellow in the infinite dimensional space there are many different points e.g. pure yellow and nothing else or pure red and pure green or  that will all occupy the same point in our eyes  dimensional space because they activate our cones in the same way as each other.,askscience,crk1f8z,1,t5_2qm4e4068598,0,t1_crjzhz2,Biophysical chemist here dilute protein solutions are usually colorless.

Esperanto is the perfect successful failure if what you read can be believed. Im summarising but in the cases where there are argued to be native speakers of Esperanto who were raised speaking it by adult speakers and in peer groups theyve changed the language undoing some of the artificiality.Im not sure if theres truth to it because I havent spent any time looking into L Esperantists but even if its entirely made up its still got a bit of truth.Any conlang that you could successfully get a community to speak would be incredibly different by the second generation of speakers and eventually it would change so much as to annoy the creator to death if they werent dead already.Languages reflect cultures and vice versa. You cant magically make people stop being sexist jerks just by inventing and propagating a language that lacks the ability to be a sexist jerk.What would be needed It would have to truly be apolitical acultural and objectively easy for anyone to learn no matter what their language background which means itd have to also be equally difficult for anyone else to learn which is a big strike against it being learned. In addition youd need some major cultural push to popularise it. Like what Scientology tried to do with movies like Battlefield Earth only successful. The problem is that using America as an example its already hard enough to get the average person to learn a foreign language like Spanish that would actually be useful and enrich their lives so I kinda doubt youd be able to get those same people to start learning a conlang even if Brad Pitts new movie is entirely in Lojban.I have more to say but gotta run.,askscience,crm1fjd,3,t5_2qm4e4087140,0,t1_crm34aq,Thank you for coming back to answer me!

Solar wind doesnt tend to reach the Earths atmosphere since it consists entirely of charged particles its deflected by the Earths magnetic field. The exception to this is when the particles in the wind move along the magnetic field lines which intersect the atmosphere near the poles which causes aurora.In terms of extracting energy youd be much better off using radiation. Ignoring other ways of getting energy from radiation i.e. photovoltaics the Suns radiation pressure is around  N at Earths distance while the pressure from solar wind is around  nN,askscience,crubej2,3,t5_2qm4e4159384,0,t3_38d444,deleted,askscience,crudpct,-5,t5_2qm4e4159597,0,t1_crudvu2,This is right. The original question seems to misunderstand what a conservative field is. In a conservative field any path you take that ends up where you started i.e. any closed loop requires net zero energy. Think of this like a roller coaster with no friction if you start at the highest point all your potential energy becomes kinetic energy at the bottom and then goes back to potential energy when you get back to the top with no losses or extra energy.For a magnetic field this is not the case. Moving a charged object in a closed loop in a clockwise direction for an appropriately oriented field could result in the net loss of energy by a charged object with total energy still being conserved in the system while moving the same object in the same loop but in a counterclockwise direction would result in a net gain of energy to the charged object again with total energy in the system being conserved.,askscience,cruekot,4,t5_2qm4e4160224,0,t1_crugh99,I wonder if aircraft structures could be improved by introducing a vacuum to their interiors?

The Med is kind of a strange beast because of the prevalence of coupled extension and subduction i.e. many of the subduction zones within the Mediterranean are retreating meaning that the rate that the trench moves away from the overriding plate is faster than the rate of subduction leading to extension in the overriding plate.

After a few years of testing a release of the predators is attempted with varying levels  of success.The original collection of predators may be even smaller as it may include cryptic species which will not interbreed. It is not uncommon that this original population is not augmented ie.  it is challenging to go to the original host range and collect MORE individuals in part because it is challenging to ensure they are of the exact species.Not all biocontrol attempts are successful of course but some are very successful and establish in the introduced range. The original  or so individuals start the lab populations which are reared in quarantine for years then mass reared to produce hundreds of thousands of individuals for release in the introduced range.tldr We have dozens of insect populations in labs started with  or so individuals kept for   years  at  days per generation that means they have remained viable for hundreds  of generations.,askscience,cs465df,35,t5_2qm4e4245654,1,t1_cs46zgs,gtchanging a bit in the process.The human chromosomes are near identical save for inconsequential variations amp minor mutations.

This high energy molecule can undergo changes in vibrational or rotational energy dropping he excited electron to a lower energy level which effectively increases the heat of the molecule.  Since the excitrd electron lost some energy when it drops back to ground it will not have the same energetic distance to travel and the emitted photon will this have less energy than the incident photon.This is my understanding of what hes trying to say.,askscience,cs579gg,1,t5_2qm4e4254656,0,t1_cs57ddg,deleted,askscience,cs57stm,1,t5_2qm4e4254671,0,t3_39p1cv,deleted,askscience,cs57v14,1,t5_2qm4e4254904,0,t1_cs5601d,deleted,askscience,cs58t8x,1,t5_2qm4e4255155,0,t1_cs580r8,As Feynman puts it in his quantum electrodynamics lecture We know that light is made of particles because we can take a very sensitive instrument that makes clicks when light shines on it and if the light gets dimmer the clicks remain just as loudthere are just fewer of them.

Sure most of them are brown and fluffy but what about humans or whales or elephants etc. Theres a lot of variation out there.Yes tons of dinosaurs had feathers and remember theres lots of different feather types too  chicks look very different to adults and wing feathers are not like body feathers. We do have numerous dinosaurs preserved with feathers and many of their near relatives would have been feathered too multiple tyrannosaurs are known to have feathers so more likely than not Tyrannosaur rex did too. Feathers do not rule out scales so theres scope for feathered and scaled animals.Currently only the theropods the bipeds mostly carnivores are known with feathers and this pattern extends to cover about rds of the known species. Earlier forms may also have had feathers.The sauropods and relatives the longnecked giants are currently only known to have had scales. Side note theres lots of scale types out there too both on these and other dinosaurs.The ornithischians everything else seem to have been primarily scaled based on various fossils but at least some had various hairlike filaments on them. Some were downright fluffy others more like odd spikes and quills a very little like a porcupine and quite how far this extends into various other groups we dont know. Its not know if these structures have some deep evolutionary relationship with feathers in which case a lot more dinosaurs had some kind of nonscale feathering or not.

Some object with charge Q is d meters away from some object with charge Q the force between them is kQQd where k is Coulombs constant .   NmC.  We can pretend that the force simply exists according to this formula.But when we do much more involved experiments at much higher precision we notice really weird things.  Like we notice that the force between two charged objects appears to propagate at the speed of light.Whats actually happening is that photons are being sent out by both objects in all directions the photons actually carry the energy required to exert work on the other object.  As soon as a photon emitted by object Q strikes object Q it transfers the tiniest amount of energy either pulling Q in the direction of Q if the charges are opposite or pushing Q away from Q if the charges are the same.And when you take ALL the many many photon interactions between Q and Q into account everything adds up to roughly the mathematical equation above.  Thats what is meant by the electromagnetic force being mediated by photons.  Photons are the force carriers for that force.Likewise gravitons are a hypothetical particle doing the same thing for gravity.,askscience,csbs07l,6,t5_2qm4e4312973,0,t1_csbm0lo,We dont know if anything is even mediated by particles we only describe mass and energy with particles but they just represent a model.

By information in this case we usually mean that some sort of particle has travelled out of the black hole and back to us.  Theres not need to invoke a asofyet hypothetical particle in the graviton photons do not have mass.  The issue isnt with the particle and its mass the issue is with the severe curvature of spacetime in the vicinity of a black hole.  In General Relativity you have to understand that gravity is not really an attractive force as it is simply that mass and energy curve spacetime.  Let me see if I can explain a bit better with an analogy  Imagine you have a bowling ball and youre trying to roll it down the lane toward the pins.  Now imagine that the lane curves upward in a steep slope.  Now imagine that this steep slope continues getting steeper and steeper and longer and longer and eventually curves back on itself.  This is somewhat of an idea of the spacetime geometry we would expect in an event horizon.  No matter how fast you can throw that bowling ball it will never ever reach the pins.  In the absence of the black hole or any other gravity well this region of space  our bowling lane  would be much like any other flat unwarped and boring.

So if youre interested in identifying a human for example your goal is not to sequence the entire humans genome.  Instead you extract whatever DNA you can and then using a cool molecular amplification procedure called PCR you single out and amplify a specific region of DNA that would be particularly helpful for identification.  It would be a region that only humans have and a region that could be used to identify individuals.  Having the PCR product allows you to then get the DNA region sequenced and if you get back more than one sequence you know youve got multiple people and you can compare them to your suspects DNA in that region.

We know where the peak should be but theres a whole load of noise and background around it. We have a lot of other detectors that are correlated with the spectrum content so we can set conditions on that detector information eg. if the peak only appears when the particle is in the middle of a certain detector then we can look at that detector and count out everything where the particle hit the edge. Now the problem is that sometimes these correlations arent linear. In fact a lot of the time the correlations make sense but arent tremendously clear in precise practical terms. For linear correlations I have already produced a method that will analyse the integral of the peak above background and provide an evaluation of precisely where to set the condition. It works amazingly well but it doesnt help when the condition needs to be multidimensional. In both cases there are complications and conditions when it comes to making these cuts and the eventuality is that creating a code to do this very quickly becomes immensely complicated.Here is an example of the algorithm doing a testrun in a simplified scenario and its... well not quite working but its a start. There are one or two glitches present but the core is doing what it should be which is nice.The whole thing sounds a bit contrived when more often than not its sufficient to simply make a graphical cut by eye where most of the particles are in each detector but even the linear correlation method I created has demonstrated that if shown how a computer will more often than not produce a far better result than a human can.Edit Its finished!

If they went straight up they would either come right back down or fly away forever depending on how much energy they used.  To get into a circular or not very eccentric elliptical orbit they need to be going almost entirely sideways by the time they get up there.  To go straight up and then straight to the side would be the least efficient way.  The efficient way to do it is to start the rocket leaning slightly and then allow the force of gravity to gradually pull the trajectory down to the side as the rocket keeps firing forward along that changing trajectory.  This is called a gravity turn  Acceleration can go towards changing your direction or changing your speed and both take fuel if you only have the rocket engine to work with.  Relying on gravity for the direction part means all your fuel can be used for increasing speed.uericwdhs makes an important point about the atmosphere creating drag.

LED lamps are somewhere around  watts if I recall correctly yet they shine as brightly as  watt lights. That  watt difference is the difference between a hot incandescent bulb and a room temperature LED. To answer your question no. The energy is not lost. However the energy is not usable as a heater. This is because heat infrared radiation happens because molecules are vibrating and the wavelength of the light is the right size to interact with those vibrations.  Visible light cannot interact with these particular vibrations the wavelength is too short so although it carries energy it doesnt transfer the heat directly.A  watt bulb would function as a ish watt heater.,askscience,csuo45t,1,t5_2qm4e4474924,0,t1_csumozn,deleted,askscience,csuqhcr,1,t5_2qm4e4476586,0,t1_csuaaxg,deleted,askscience,csuxz4u,1,t5_2qm4e4478151,0,t1_csv2s5w,Versions of this question come up fairly often.

This means one molecule of a polysaccharide contains about  times a sugar molecule. Those polysaccharides are bound to proteins. One protein is about kDa  atoms big. Several polysaccharides bind to one protein. So one molecule of a glykoprotein what the molecule consisting of polysaccharides and proteins is called does have about   atoms or even more.

This wont happen both because the thermal expansion between  K meaning that a one squre meter glass plate would expand about  micron in each direction per K which wouldnt create enough tension to break the glass even in a perfect frame secondly the glass sits fairly loosely in its frame except from the front and back windows but they both sit in rubber frames and they have a bit of curvature that would be able to take a lot more thermal expansion that any weather related temperatures could provide.The other thing that could cause this is the expansion of the air in the car but again this would never happen. firstly because no commercial car is air tight making it impossible to create a pressure difference in the car by only changing the temperature. and secondly even if the car was completely air tight then the pressure difference would still be very small. Lets get out our calculators for this one. lets assume that the temperature in the car is  o C when youre driving it and lets then assume that its  o C when its been standing out for a while both fairly extreme temperature that would probably never happen then lets look at the ideal gas law pVNRT. The only thing that has changed is the T which is the temperature in Kelvin well then get the pressure difference in bar by dividing the new temperature with the old temperature ..  . bar. That is the absolute highest pressure difference youll get in this imagined example and that wouldnt be near enough to blow out the windows.,askscience,ct54qf2,3,t5_2qm4e4559620,0,t3_3dgt1f,deleted,askscience,ct5cw2f,1,t5_2qm4e4559745,0,t1_ct51yva,deleted,askscience,ct5dgf9,1,t5_2qm4e4560292,0,t1_ct554ze,Does it mean that floating somewhere in that supercritical fluid is the Galileo Space Probe?

It is a learned behavior.When you start out driving a car you make a lot of mistakes because your mind has not yet learned how the motion of the wheel and pressing of pedals correspond to changes in the behavior of the car. This means that you have to actively think about what you are doing.As you build more experience you no longer need to think carefully about how to move the wheel any more than you have to think about how to move your arm to grab something.Eventually the actions you take become automatic i.e they are take over by the part of your brain I believe the cerebellum responsible for performing actions youve learned to do well.Muscle memory has very little to do with the muscles and a whole lot to do with parts of your brain. edit spelling,askscience,ct5hbaf,4,t5_2qm4e4561874,0,t1_ct554ze,Love the finish.

Also depending on what you mean this covers about  different topics. Its especially interesting that as we examine thought this rarely works without rudimentary formation of language even just basic vocalization. There is certainly plenty of evidence that human without the formation of language have rudimentary thought but clearly language is required for most higherorder thinking.So why is that important? Because deep thought or complex thought requires the interactions of many different regions of the brain including the corpus collusum the frontal lobe the Wyrnicks area Brocas area and many more. But language areas are key in the formation of complex thought. Then there are mood centers sensory centers and more. They all interact to create thought even while asleep in many cases. Looking at thought more broadly we find that even the concept of thought is absurdly complex and interesting.There are philosophies of thought established in the time of the Greeks and carried by philosophers today.

You can do trials with one group of people who are on SSRIs and monitor how many take their own lives or attempt to compared with those who do not take SSRIs.The difficulty is it would be unethical to use doubleblind placebo trials in these kinds of cases  as it could be argued that people taking sugar pills who kill themselves may not have done it if they had been taking the real drug.

Seems to me like it would be as simple as having one of the quarks switch spin but surely theres a reason why that cant be.To be perfectly honest I have wondered this question myself and done a bit of searching about it in the past without getting a really convincing answer.  So this morning I did a little more searching and I found an interesting StackExchange answer that seems to give a pretty convincing explanation based around the Pauli exclusion principle.  You may already know this much but in case you dont  the Pauli exclusion principle is a quantummechanical requirement that the wavefunction for a fermionic particle halfinteger spin must always be antisymmetric and therefore multiple such particles cannot occupy the same quantum state.  Since both the individual valence quarks and the whole baryon are fermions they must all have antisymmetric wavefunctions.According to that given answer the quarks inside a baryon have four degrees of freedom flavor the type of quark like up or down color charge red green or blue spin projection  or  for quarks or possibly also  or  for the whole baryon and orbital angular momentum.The StackExchange answer takes the approach of assuming that the uuu or ddd baryon is a ground state meaning its a lowestenergy state we want to know why it doesnt exist with a spin projection of  rather than  and then sort of shows a proof by contradiction where a spin projection of  forces the wavefunction to be symmetric and thus disallowed by the Pauli exclusion principle. Flavor  Since the baryon has all the same type of quark uuu or ddd the flavor part of the wavefunction is symmetric. Color  Since each quark must have a different color the color part of the wavefunction is antisymmetric. Orbital angular momentum  Since we assume that it is a ground state all of the quarks are assumed to have no orbital angular momentum and therefore the orbital part of the wavefunction is symmetric.So above two parts of the wavefunction are symmetric and the last part is antisymmetric.  We know the total wavefunction must be antisymmetric so that means that the only remaining degree of freedom spin projection must also be symmetric  each of the quarks must have the same spin projection.  If they dont then the spin part of the wavefunction is antisymmetric and the total wavefunction is symmetric which we cant have due to Pauli exclusion.So apparently if you relax the requirement that the baryon is in a ground state this allows each of the quarks to have orbital angular momentum which in turn allows for the orbital angular momentum part of the wavefunction to be antisymmetric rather than symmetric.  That means that the spin part can now be antisymmetric too while keeping the total wavefunction antisymmetric.Hence it is possible to have a delta baryon with a total spin of  but not in a ground state the ground state is forbidden by the Pauli exclusion principle.  So the delta baryons with spin of  end up being more massive than both the proton and neutron and the other delta baryons that have spin .  The proton and neutron each have a mass of roughly  MeV while the spin  delta baryons all have a mass of roughly  MeV.  The spin  delta baryons then end up with a mass of roughly  MeV or  MeV for even furtherexcited states I believe.  Presumably a lot of this mass comes from the strong interaction dynamics related to the configuration of angular momentum but I dont think we know that for sure yet its just the most viable hypothesis I think.  Like I think I mentioned in my last post we dont have a reliable idea of how angular momentum is distributed inside of a baryon yet.Hope that helps!,askscience,ct7q7vy,2,t5_2qm4e4578751,0,t1_ct7qswu,The energy to move something into the sun is massive because of orbital mechanics that Im not qualified to explain. ,askscience,ct7r9fm,55,t5_2qm4e4579035,0,t1_ct7shcl,deleted,askscience,ct7sjic,1,t5_2qm4e4579069,0,t1_ct7p235,deleted,askscience,ct7sp0q,1,t5_2qm4e4579719,0,t1_ct7qm12,it has a huge eccentric orbit.

The ratio of reflected to incident light is the albedo which is about . for the moonThe amount of light from the Sun incident on a celestial object is determined by how far that object is from the Sun and how large that object is. Since both the Earth and Moon and similar distances from the Sun lets focus on the latter. The amount of light incident on a spherical object is proportional to the square of the objects radius.  So the ratio of the light incident on the Moon to the light incident on the Earth is the square of ratio of their radii which is about .Going back to the albedo point since a fraction of that light incident to the moon is reflected back we can multiply that result by . to get an orderofmagnitude comparison to the light from moon vs. the light from the Sun. It ends up being  .

Youll find that as the rotor magnet passes the stator magnet the tangential force will reverse somewhat before it passes center and any acceleration produced as it approaches will be counteracted.It will not spin it will stop with the  rotor magnets slightly on the  side of the stator magnets.,askscience,cthz67a,9,t5_2qm4e4663618,0,t1_cthtwp9,So were the people of the s all wrong for having a scientific consensus on Eugenics that was later proven false to many degrees?

Theres paralytics amnesiacs sedatives analgesics and more. Paralytics work at a the level of the muscular ACh receptor through various ways so if given one then you could be entirely conscious and still not move a single muscle. We also give medicines like midazolam to reduce anxiety and prevent memory formation.  However generally when people speak of anesthesia they mean general anesthetic agents like propofol or various volitive gaseous agents.  We do know general anesthetic agents like propofol do more than simple paralysis and memory prevention.  First of all these tend to cause paralysis at the level of the brain not at the level of the muscles. You dont move with those because you simply arent conscious to send signals to the part of your brain that tells your somatic nervous system to move.  Muscular paralysis is achieved through action on the acetylcholine receptor in various ways competitive inhibition irreversible inhibition etc..  You can be fully conscious with those drugs on board and not move however thats not the case as much with propofol since it acts on the brain.  For instance if youre conscious with propofol you can move. Im an anesthesia tech and a college student in the sciences so I can speak to this from a practical level.

To put it simplyThe Pulsar emits light over a certain range of radio frequencies. As the photons travel towards us they interact with mainly free electrons in interstellar space. This interaction slightly prolongs their travel time. The kicker here is that lower frequency photons get slowed down more than higher frequency ones resulting in frequency dispersion of the measured signal. By carefully measuring the degree of this dispersion we can calculate the total massnumber of interacting electrons between us and the pulsar. If we then make educated assumptions about the average density of these free electrons in the space between us and the pulsar we can calculate the distance.,askscience,ctvuwlp,2,t5_2qm4e4771075,0,t1_ctvuh4a,deleted,askscience,ctvxqhd,1,t5_2qm4e4773856,0,t1_ctw9qhb,deleted,askscience,ctwachs,17,t5_2qm4e4773902,0,t3_3g9y1t,deleted,askscience,ctwak0f,19,t5_2qm4e4774871,0,t1_ctw81k4,deleted,askscience,ctweybv,22,t5_2qm4e4775559,0,t3_3gb4ro,Hi evoketheforms if your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

It is a consequence of the way the fundamental forces work and a proper treatment of it requires the use of the standard model of particle physics which is based on quantum field theory. ,askscience,ctwok0l,2,t5_2qm4e4777005,0,t3_3gbtbo,deleted,askscience,ctwom4j,1,t5_2qm4e4777213,0,t1_ctwah85,deleted,askscience,ctwpjwc,1,t5_2qm4e4778011,0,t1_ctwsozk,deleted,askscience,ctwt5t8,2,t5_2qm4e4778735,0,t3_3g9qws,deleted,askscience,ctwwfsb,1,t5_2qm4e4780056,0,t3_3gdc7s,Hi OV if your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Trawls can only collect so much and a lot of organisms can be damagedlost during the pulls so these ROV dives give amazing insight into whats going on down there. We can even carefully collect specimens on this trip to bring up carefully! Fishes tend to have the greatest diversity in the deep sea between  and  meters when you get deeper the abundance and the diversity tends to fall off. This is especially true in hard surface areas without loose substrate less places to find food etc. I think we have seen a fair amount of fishes but I expect we will see more on shallower dives and those around sea mounts.As for the carcasses of whales etc. The ocean is a really big place. finding whale falls or the carcasses of large organisms is fairly rare even though there may be many out there just because of the magnitude of the oceans size. As for anthropocentric disturbances the closer you get to human shipping lanes and civilization you increase the chances of seeing human effects. on this mission so far we have seen relatively little debris but on our last expedition to the Caribbean we saw quite a bit of trash etc. Acidification is harder to observe via video but with samples and future collections and studies Im sure it will be possible to measure.

The entropy of a system is a measure of the number of different ways energy can be distributed in the system. Thats why people describe it as a measure of disorder. The number of molecules present in a system the heat capacity of those molecules the spacing between the molecules  the structure of the molecules these are all things that play a role in entropy. The more common saying that Ive heard used is that the Entropy of the Universe is always positive. Which in general is true. This doesnt necessarily mean that for all changes of state the change in entropy will be positive. For example if you put two pieces of metal together one at  degrees C and the other at  degrees C the entropy change associated with the two reaching equilibrium will be positive overall. However assuming constant volume the entropy change of the metal piece that was originally at  degrees C will be negative. ,askscience,cu2yc4e,1,t5_2qm4e4827222,0,t3_3gy1sc,A hypothesis is This is what I think might actually be going on.

Whereas in the SternGerlach experiment the electron wavefunction is a wave packet. The trajectory of a wave packet is very similar to a classical trajectory through the system.

But of course thats totally unappealing. The real question is why does a meter have the length it does compared to a second?Well a meter is going to be defined by how many atoms you can pack into a lattice that makes up your meterstick.And a second is going to be defined by the rate at which various atomic and interatomic processes occur. I mean fundamentally thats what youre asking. If atoms were  the size and everything else stayed the same the apparent speed of light would increase by a factor of .So ultimately the answer for why is c the value it is in some given set of units is ultimately because c drives the fundamental physical processes that give atoms their size and govern how fast electromagnetic processes between atoms occur. c as the unit you think you know is this complex interaction of c and h and the mass of an electron and the charge of an electron and a whole mess of fundamental physical constants that build our scales of space and time up from there. Humanish length scales are meters because thats how much space it takes for all the atoms to make up a thing roughly as big as us. Humanish time scales are seconds because thats roughly a length of time within say a factor of  that we think of as being short because of the rates of the chemical reactions in our brains that make up our thoughts.

I hope you have a bit of a physics background because Ill be using a little of that.Say we have a particle. This particles total energy can be split up in kinetic and potential energy. As the particle moves faster it gains kinetic energy. As the particle rolls higher up a hill it gets potential energy energy can get released as it rolls back down. Beware this climbing and rolling down has to be done in discrete steps as this analogy only works without velocity in the energy direction. Energy is conserved that means that if a particle moves up a hill it trades kinetic energy for potential energy. If we have a mountain that requires a potential of  J to summit that means that if the particle somehow happens to get there it will have a potential energy of  J. With a set amount of energy to start with this gives us    Ekin  E  EpotNow the fun part start when we consider the case where the potential energy is somehow higher than the energy this particle has. This is weird and leaves us to conclude that somehow the particle has negative kinetic energy. That seems impossible so lets evaluate the math classical kinetic energy is given by Ekin  mv .Mathematically this can only turn negative with an imaginary velocity and well that truly doesnt make sense.Good thing we have quantum physics to help us out which gives us a quantum version of energy given by something called the Hamiltonian. This operator is used in the Schrdinger equation that describes how a particle moves and if you plug in a potential energy higher than the particles total energy it actually does have a solution. Now to finally answer your question this solution is an ordinary differential equation that you can plug numbers into and find an exact answer to.To expand on this answer ordinary solutions of the Schrdinger equation are imaginary exponents waves but solutions with negative kinetic energy are ordinary exponents that decay. When you have a wall the particle cant go through you have to glue equations before in and after the wall together. So youll get a wave function that switches to an exponential decay in the wall and whats left continues as a wave function again.,askscience,cu8nszi,1,t5_2qm4e4872944,0,t1_cu8mqdh,gt This makes sense. Thanks!  But as Feynman said the problem is now just moved to why cant two fermions occupy the same state?Any quantum mechanical system e.g. a set of one or multiple particles is described by an abstract mathematical quantity called the wavefunction or quantum mechanical state. Think of it as a number or a set of numbers. The only thing we can measure is the absolute value of these numbers.There are two types of quantum mechanical particles in three or higher dimensional space bosons and fermions. They are distinguished by the way exchanging two equal particles affects the wavefunction.If you exchange two equal bosons for one another nothing happens to the wavefunction at all. A wavefunction of two bosons must be symmetric with respect to change of the particle labels.If you exchange two equal fermions for one another the wavefunction gets a minus sign. A wavefunction of two fermions must be antisymmetric w.r.t. particle exchange. So suppose two fermions labelled  and  were in the exact same quantum state call it p. Since the wavefunction must be antisymmetric it would be something like pp  pp  . Since a wavefunction   means something doesnt exist two fermions in the same state cannot exist.I dont believe a less mathematical explanation exists.You can also ask why fermions and bosons are the two types of particles and that can also be explained the explanation involves the representation theory of symmetries.EDIT Formatting thanks uskratchx,askscience,cu8rtg4,11,t5_2qm4e4872971,0,t3_3hn09s,deleted,askscience,cu8rxvp,1,t5_2qm4e4872973,0,t1_cu8mb4n,deleted,askscience,cu8ry7e,1,t5_2qm4e4873147,0,t1_cu8mqpr,deleted,askscience,cu8sqqv,1,t5_2qm4e4873815,0,t1_cu8bxu2,I think its actually not so much cost as its just not selected for. For a complex trait like slowing aging which requires all sorts of cellular machinery to evolve it needs to confer some kind of evolutionary advantage. Evolution is not directed so the repair systems are never making any decision about whether something is worth it or too costly but natural selection is doing this in a larger sense. The way any trait develops is through random mutation and then it is selected for based on whether that mutation makes you more likely to spread your genes on to future generations.  So imagine that life span is controlled by a single gene its not but lets imagine for simplicitys sake. Now imagine that a mouse that has a life expectancy of about  months before its eaten by something bigger develops a mutation that lets it live an extra  years on top of its natural lifespan which maxes out around  years for a mouse in captivity. Will that mutation confer any evolutionary advantage? No the mouse will get eaten long before it even lives out the natural lifespan it already has much less a much longer one. So having the long life mutation does not allow the mouse to produce more offspring and therefore the trait is not selected for. Now imagine the same mutation cropping up the parrot. The parrot is unlikely to be killed at an early age so living an extra  years would confer an advantage assuming the mutation kept their reproductive systems from aging as well theyd have a lot more time to create lots of offspring and spread their genes on. Their offspring who got the long life mutation would do the same and also produce lots more babies who would in turn be selected for. Thus natural selection chooses a positive trait when it is useful but ignores it when its not useful.  ,askscience,cu8vs6n,1,t5_2qm4e4874461,0,t1_cu8yj1p,deleted,askscience,cu8ypx4,112,t5_2qm4e4875082,0,t1_cu90pxu,deleted,askscience,cu91jmt,1,t5_2qm4e4875312,0,t1_cu8w55f,deleted,askscience,cu92l7h,3,t5_2qm4e4876342,0,t1_cu95pot,From wikipedia so a grain of salt as always Except for helium and probably neon all gases that can be breathed have a narcotic effect although widely varying in degree.

That means thrusting around on the imaginary surface of a sphere  AU in diameter centered on the sun.So after waiting  years for it to get out there and getting one picture you have to wait another few decades to get a picture of the next thing.

Easiest way to imagine that answer is if you are sitting in a spinning computer chair with your arms out and someone suddenly materialized a medicine ball with your own weight into one of your hands.    The problem I have with that simplification is that the chair exists in a frame of reference being acted upon by the force of the Earths gravity. If Earth were to suddenly sprout another Earthmass around the equator it would completely throw off the center of mass and therefore rotation.  The result of all of that is probably a really weird dance where the Earths rotation slows as large portions of it are eaten away and further distorting the rotation.

Even so the reason rearwheeldrive layouts tend to feel better is that as the car squats back due to inertia it puts weight over the driven axle whereas in a front wheel drive car it unloads the driven axle.

They both fall down and hit the ground at the same time.Scenario  You drop a bowling ball from some height and time it. Then you drop a feather and you time that. The bowling ball hits the ground sooner but the difference is so imperceptibly small that no stopwatch in the world will be able to tell the difference.The force of gravity between two objects is FGMmr where M is the mass of the earth and m is the mass of the object. Since Newtons second law states that FMA A being acceleration its easy to see that the acceleration of the object is therefore GMr ... or that the mass of the object doesnt affect its own acceleration so the feather and the bowling ball will accelerate at the same rate.HOWEVER... this neglects the fact that as the Earth pulls on the object the object also pulls on the Earth with the same force. Which means that the Earth is also falling towards the object...slightly. As a result since the bowling ball pulls harder on the Earth than the feather does it will hit the Earth slightly sooner. Usually we can ignore this since the Earth is so much more massive than any object we would ever consider dropping from any height. How significant is this difference? Well a quick trip to Wolfram Alpha tells me that the difference when dropped from  meter above the ground will be on the order of  seconds a time period so short that we cannot possibly hope to measure it with any current technology.This exercise will be left to the reader. ,askscience,cuxey43,16,t5_2qm4e5072721,0,t3_3khj9o,Hi aspiringaplicant thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

This is rare and only likely when we havent been able to import enough electricity from mainland Europe.The UK is currently trialling a large battery backup system essentially a huge bank of batteries that can instantly pickup load.

However if a sudden increased load creates a change in frequency its because youve suddenly introduced additional resistance in the rotation of the generator motor. Increasing the resistance in the coils of the motor would cause it to spin more slowly thus creating a lower frequency.Im assuming you understand the principals of electricity generation. If not you may want to watch a video on how we physically turn rotational motion into electricity. Youll see magnets spinning past coils of wire. Each magnet is either N or S in polarity. Each magnet is half of one sine wave. The frequency is the distance between sine waves. So if you slow the motor you slow the frequency just a bit. The power generating system only uses as much energy from its source coal oil nuclear hydro etc to overcome the resistance of the magnets passing the coils and keep everything spinning in time. When timing drops due to increased load resistance the system consumes additional power and converts it into electricity.

If the generator was running at a constant speed before the drop outputting Hz then there would have been a  net torque on the shaft.  After the lights shut off the counter torque would drop and the net torque on the shaft would increase... causing and increase in both frequency AND voltage.At this point the generator controller would try to slow down the generator speed but for things like nuclear it could take a while.,askscience,cv34yt9,1,t5_2qm4e5120953,0,t3_3l56ku,Thank you for your submission!

Using checksumming.But N cant protect you against simultaneous failure of two of your pieces of data to do that you need N etc. So what you generally do is figure out how often your data fails and then design your redundancy system to balance the overhead of additional copies vs data reliability that you need. More durability is more expensive. For example Amazon S guarantees . durability on it standard storage but you can pay less and get Reduced Redundancy Storage which comes with a guarantee of . durability.In other words Amazon and Google lose data all the time.

Insofar as the scheme you propose its certainly one option  it could be that production of the final product is actually deleterious to the cell and you just wind up generating a lot of a metabolic intermediate which you harvest and then convert separately.

In brief Type I are the slow twitch fibers they are fatigue resistant They are the fibers that keep working in  endurance exercises. Type IIa are  fast oxidativeglycolitic fibers. They are less fatigue resistant than Type I fibers but more than Type IIb fibers. They can gernate more force than Type I fibers and tend the be the muscles used in intense sprint level exercise. Type IIb fibers are not fatigue resistant but are very fast and powerful so they tend to be the fibers used in hard sprints and power lifting. They also have the greatest capacity for hypertrophy. And that is where we finally get back to your question because hypertrophy is the term for increasing muscle size. Most muscles are made up of about  Type I fiber with an equal mix of Type IIa and Type IIb making up the rest. But the muscles of your neck back and legs have a higher proportion of Type I because they are mostly used to hold up your body so they need to maintain tension over long periods of time. Your muscles do respond to the type off strain put on them its why so many sprinters are huge while so many marathoners are slender.Power lift type exercise will increase the number and size of Type II fibers relative to Type I fibers. Im afraid thats as close as I can get to answering your question.

Different levels of the same gene? Yes absolutely. High energy tissues will have comparatively higher expression of the mitochondrially encoded components of the electron transport chain. Mitochondrial mRNA and tRNAs are also post transcriptionally regulated with respect to demand. So while uMitaines is correct is saying that the origin and character of mtDNA transcription necessitates roughly equal levels of transcription. However if you go in an quantitate different mRNAtRNA levels you might get different ratios between tissues due to posttranscriptional regulation. In fact there is extensive literature showing this occurs in disease states and mouse models of mtDisease where levels of specific mtDNA derived RNA transcripts are downup regulated compared to others in a post transcriptional manner.Bear in mind mitochondria have other roles beyond simple energy production although the mitochondrial genome only contains components of the electron transport chain and associated translational machinery. However in mitochondrial disease you can actually have cells with different mitochondrial DNA. Some mitochondrial diseases are what we can heteroplasic in that above a certain threshold a  of mutated mtDNA in a particular mitochondrion cell or tissue can cause disease. So you could say in this case they have different genes the majority are just point mutations. You can get different ratios of mutatedwt mtDNA due to the nature of mitochondrial replication i.e. genetic drift occurs as well as certain bottlenecks during zygoteblastocyst development and this can change during life and development.,askscience,cvcctfv,2,t5_2qm4e5197505,0,t3_3m2clx,removed,askscience,cvchqxw,1,t5_2qm4e5198186,0,t1_cvcjndj,gt inject informationWhat about the opposite?

As the cancer progresses the genome of the cancer cells becomes more unstable more mutations happen more quickly and the cancer cells become more heterogenous.

And you are correct C geochronometers are useless outside a rather narrow range of values down to about   years. Much if not most geochronology is carried out with UPb methods on zircons in igneous rocks. Those get accuracies in the order of about  My all the way down to the earlier terrestrial materials dated at . Gy they would presumably still be reliable on older samples if we had any. But there are other methods as well depending on the nature of the materials at hand.Normally most chemical processes will not discriminate between isotopes. The reaction products of these mostly inorganic processes will present C C ratios which are pretty close to those of a standard Say the PDB and within a very narrow range of values within about  . But some biological processes photosynthesis in particular see Park amp Epstein  Usdowski  do discriminate between isotopes and integrate C and C at different rates leading to much greater variation of C C ratios which might be as far from the standard as say   and within a quite larger range of variation. This ratio has been used for a lot of things such as a proxy of paleooceanic tempratures Grossman amp Ku  and for quantifying the composition of the diets of extinct creatures de Niro amp Epstein The end result is that when considering carboncontaining rocks and minerals it is quite straightforward to discriminate between biogenic and abiogenic materials particularly for carbonates shells limestone and like that from the signature of their carbon stable isotopes. And that this is completely independent of what happens with the unstable isotope C ...For some reason the applications of stable isotope geochemistry receive considerably less press than the applications of unstable isotopes.

When using various ionization and extraction techniques to overcome ionization efficiency changes and or changes in extraction efficiencies you will often use an internal standard.  The best internal standard is an isotopically labeled version of the same compound  you are analyzing for. This is ideal as it has the same ionization efficiency and extraction efficiency as the compound of interest.So what you do is spike your sample with a known amount of the isotopically labeled compound and then during analysis you use the ratio of the labeled compound to the measured compound that is the way you make up your standard curve. So if the ionization efficiency of the instrument drifts during analysis the ratio remains the same.Since the internal standard has a different mass to charge ratio it is isotopically labeled it can be separated during analysis.As far as double spiking I would assume one spike before preparation and then one before analysis so that you can determine changes.,askscience,cvq7c8h,2,t5_2qm4e5309000,0,t1_cvqa2qd,removed,askscience,cvqabip,1,t5_2qm4e5310154,0,t1_cvqfi86,removed,askscience,cvqfmg9,1,t5_2qm4e5312047,0,t1_cvqnxxi,I take your points and dont disagree with what youre saying.

Good quality sound is achieved by taking a signal which is usually quite weak and boosting it in stages. This allows a few things to happen finer control over which frequencies are boosted and which noise are filtered less opportunity for noise from the components to seep in easier to use each component at its optimal level.When you apply too much gain early on in the path the signal can get clipped. Imagine the smooth curve of a sine wave hitting a ceiling and turning square at the top. Thats literally one of the most common things youd see in an oscilloscope in the scenario youre describing. If you turn up your tv all the way the signal coming into your stereo will be closer to the ceiling of what your stereo can handle coming in and youll hear distortion. On the other hand set too low your stereo will amplify any incoming noise along with the weak signal and youll hear hiss.

When you weigh the earth in this way you are measuring the normal force between it and the scale which is really just the weight of the scale since our concept of weight on earth is based on earths gravitational field.

Einstein himself said in many interviews that he visualized the speed of light from a photons perspective.  Source. If you want to argue with Einstein be my guest. The user did say he was speaking in laymans terms  he wasnt devising a mathematical proof. Thats not how OP framed the question.

And in this case the analogy wasnt that misleading considering the nature of the question and the difficulties people encounter when trying to grasp these concepts.gt time slows as you approach c which is also a very incorrect statementIts not very incorrect.

Put enough energy into a small space you get particles which appear to move slower  but this is most likely the result of some statistical arrangement. Light travels at C  but when light moves through a medium is travels slower because it bumps and zigzags absorption emission. An atom stays as an atom and does not degenerate into photons because it is more stable as an atom  but that doesnt mean that it cant. Obviously this hasnt been proven but imagine it this way You have a hollow ball with a hole in it. Light enters but whenever it hits a wall it moves in some random direction. Now imagine there is also random stuff floating around in the ball to absorb reflect reemit the light. Now imagine that not only is the hole barely large enough for the light to enter but it also moves. Anyway.. light enters assuming it keeps bouncing eventually it will bounce out. The speed of light being finite forces the entrance and exit of the light to be some time span. If light traveled infinitely fast then this process would be instantaneous. Im talking very handy wavy but as far as I know this analogy extends to every process that has any time span. Scientists know that matter is made out of energy and they know that energy travels at c they dont know however why all of a sudden putting energy in some arrangement causes an inertia aspect to appear and for the stuff to slow down. Sure there are theories higgs etc...but whatever you end up naming it it all seems to boil down to the world being a giant complex system run by chaotic statistical events who at the smallest level of energy must have components moving at the speed of light.so its a good thing that speed or the universe forces that speed to appear finite ,askscience,cvy8i4e,1,t5_2qm4e5371533,0,t1_cvy7gm6,removed,askscience,cvy9v4u,1,t5_2qm4e5371769,0,t1_cvy9zk6,Thanks this is great info.

For instance very commonly asked questions are of the ilk if the Sun disappeared...? if Earth suddenly split in two...? etc. Just like questions about time travel and fasterthanlight travel those questions are also impossible to answer. There is a place for hypothetical questions but questions like those give up too much physics just to entertain them. So it is difficult or nigh impossible to answer them because its unclear which physics we should give up and which we should keep.I prefer just to leave those impossible questions unanswered particularly on this sub which is for accurate and expert science.

Yes but no. Sjostrom found significant differences in fiber counts by dominant side in a cadaver study which has become the basis of ongoing research in human muscle hyperplasia. This study  while not outright advocating human muscle hyperplasia wont rule it out.. Good but vague. Neuromuscular strength gains are based on motor unit synchronization  and rate coding  the increased firing rate of amotor neurons.. For sure! This is very dependent on the movement and training status of the athlete.. Superfluous  this has nothing to do with absolute strength levels.. Yes  this is a neural inhibitionprotection mechanism. Feedback regarding the length  and tension  in a muscle reduce firing of amotor neurons via Renshaw inhibition in the dorsal horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord. Its essentially so you dont overcontract and hurt yourself. The best example is that of a deadlift  try with straps I bet you can lift more.. Spot on.. Yes...but why? What mechanical and metabolic characteristics cause differences in muscle fibers and how do these relate to performance of a contraction? Lacking detail. Youd be doing ok in my class. I think you can do better  focus on the question! Is the strength of muscles proportional to their diameter crosssectional area or volume? Or is it not linear?Proportional to PCSA which is reflective of myofibrillar protein content. Early strength gains are due to neuromuscular adaptations and after  weeks of training hypertrophic adaptations play major role in continuing performance increases. Fiber types have no bearing on strength  muscle creates nearequal force per cross sectional area regardless of type. Type II fibers contract faster increasing power output.

The images that we have through telescopes is of course completely untarnished and simply absorbed directly by our imaging tools.

Im a postdoc at the University of Washington studying clinical psychology.  You can check out my post history for a bit of context. The advice you get should really be tailored to what you want to do.  As a whole Ph.Ds in clinical are more research focused.  Thats not to say you dont get excellent clinical training but there are programs that will have more clinical focus.  As Ratwhowouldbeking mentioned theres something called a Psy.D. program which focuses on clinical practice over research.   Problematically a lot of these programs have a reputation for giving less than ideal trainingeducation.    You might be interested in looking into these Rutgers is one of the reputable programs.  You can get a PsyD and be considered a psychologist.  Research will help you get into a Ph.D. program as mentioned usually you can take courses and get credit for this.  This is more or less just confirmation of what was said before.  Below Ill add new stuff.GPA on average is about a . to get into a program.  On top of that study for your GRE and actually put some work into it.  People procrastinate on that way too much. My biggest piece of advice is figure out how youre going to approach the science and learn that.  Im a behaviorist.  It makes sense to me from a scientific approach.  I learned all about behavioral approaches to psychology and was able to speak in a sophisticated way about them.  If you dont have an approach you adhere to finding a graduate school that A. you want to go to and B. wants you there is going to be a lot harder.  I also suggest if youre going to look into a Ph.D. program figuring out what youre passionate about.  Im passionate about treatments I dont really care about the problem.  Some people are more passionate about the problems such as sexual assault and how alcohol contributes to it or disorders understanding depression.  Start reading journal articlesbookswhatever even if you dont understand it all.  Thats kind of rambly because Im at the end of a long day at work.

It is in a  stoichiometric ratio. But as more methane is released to the atmosphere the more hydroxyl radicals will be consumed. As the concentration of hydroxyl radicals go down the lifetime of methane in the atmosphere will go up which is explained by kinetics. I am operating under the assumption that the hydroxyl radical formation is slower than the amount of methane released to the atmosphere that make it to the stratosphere and troposphere. Knowing this will methane became a larger issue in the future if we dont keep it in check now versus later?

Check again if you can.If you did then it certainly is odd that a weak acid reacted faster than two strong acids. My best guess is that although the pKa of acetic acid is larger than of the other two acids this just tells you the thermodynamics of the process not the kinetics.

Its excellent for explaining circuit analysis to the point that there are real working hydraulic equivalents of pretty complex circuits called boost converters called ram pumps. In the hydraulic analogy while the milkshake doesnt move as quickly through a straw the pressure wave when you start trying to drink your milkshake does move at the speed of sound in milkshake. Unless milkshakes are some weird non Newtonian fluid.To get into things like latency and bandwidth you need to know about how electromagnetic waves propagate. The hydraulic analogy isnt really useful anymore here.Physical properties of a material set the speed of light in that material. This is also the speed that a voltage change will propogate through that material. In air and free space it is x ms and in a wire it is somewhere around x ms. This sets latency.Bandwidth is more abstract. There are all sorts of ways to transmit information through a wire ranging from simple Morse code to very complicated G cell phone networks. Annoyingly bandwidth is used to refer to two different things  the width of frequency band used by a signal or the amount of data that can be sent in one second. But data speed bandwidth seems to be what you are talking about. The amount of data you can send per second depends on how quickly you can input data symbols limited by the line itself  after a certain point faster pulses will just smear together and how much information you send per symbol. This isnt something that the garden hose analogy is useful for anymore.

Assuming the light source is much hotter its emissions will peak at shorter wavelengths. Then the grey body absorbs part of it heating up to some temperature but it cant get as hot as the source by mere absorption in part because its reflecting a fraction of the light and in part because its not covering the whole solid angle.

This means that life would have a head start at forming on a place like mars which would have been habitable before the earth was.  This means life could have gotten its start on mars or deep inside a comet while the earth was still cooling off thus when it found its way here it flourished.  In the meantime mars died as a planet so it can no longer support an ecosystem.  this is a personal opinion but I know of some others who share it with me...  Its kind of emotional and rather up lifting to think of our ecosystem our lineage as being larger than just the earth.  It makes you feel a bit more connected to the universe around you if you can think that life can spring up virtually all around you.  It makes our world just a little bit less lonely...Of course that second point is NOT the reasoning for such a theory to develop and it should NOT be taken as evidence for such a theory.  But you asked why some people prefer the theory...  So I gave you a scientific and an emotional reason why some can prefer it.,askscience,cxap5gq,29,t5_2qm4e5759526,0,t3_3tymym,removed,askscience,cxb0up7,1,t5_2qm4e5762641,0,t3_3u30r1,Hi ASKABOUTINITIUM thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

However when you look at the actual GR solutions to black holes the mass is located nowhere but the singularity so defining density like this is unwise.  While the mass is located presumably in the singularity this isnt really helpful considering that the density is undefined or infinite if we want to be loose with our wording. Further still theres good reason to believe GR is incomplete and that the singularity is not physical and will be replaced in a future theory.,askscience,cxl3jhh,13,t5_2qm4e5840317,0,t3_3v5z8g,Thank you for your submission!

People sometimes get confused by cardinality because their intuition says that these sets are not the same size. Indeed the natural numbers are a proper subset of the integers. So in SOME sense at least there are fewer naturals than integers.When we say that the integers and the naturals have the same number of elements remember that this is actually an abuse of terminology and what we REALLY mean to say if we are wearing our pedantic hats is There is a bijection between the two sets. Thats ALL it means. It does NOT mean the sets have the same size. It means that for purposes of this conversation we define two sets to be the same size if theres a bijection.That way nobody ever has to object that bijection doesnt match our intuition. Thats perfectly ok. Its just a definition.Now it turns out that proper subsets do NOT give us an acceptable theory of ordering sets as smaller or greater. For example if Z is the integers then Z all the integer multiples of  is a proper subset of Z the even numbers. And Z is a proper subset of Z. But Z is bijective with Z. So proper subsets do not play nice with cardinalities and for reasons of convenience and according to the judgment of decades of professional mathematicians we use the idea of bijection.But its not Godgiven. Does that make sense? Its just one particular way to assign a size of some kind to a set. Its not the only one for example measure theory is yet an entirely different way of assigning sizes to sets. In measure theory there can be countable and uncountable sets having the same size. It also turns out that the subset relation is extremely important sometimes. Its common to have some set X and to consider the power set of X ordered by set inclusion. Its not a total order but its an interesting partial order. You can see that its a tree structure so computer scientists are interested and a Boolean algebra so algebraists and logicians are interested.Thats an example where sometimes we care MORE about the subset relation than we do about cardinality.So if we can take bijection off its pedestal we can see it as one tool in a whole toolbox full of different ways to measure and organize infinite collections. ,askscience,cxl91n1,9,t5_2qm4e5842097,0,t1_cxlezb8,removed,askscience,cxlfbui,1,t5_2qm4e5842129,0,t1_cxl75uj,Add to that stopping radio waves is why subs must surface or nearly surface to communicate with surface ships and home base.

I  fact a coal power plant puts out more radiation than a nuclear plant. This is because there are many materials on the earths crust that are slightly radioactive. Hell even uranium is a lot more common than you expect.

A long halflife means the material takes a long time to decay and thus it produces less radiation. Thats the important bit the consequences areIsotopes with halflifes of thousands or even millions of years you could eat these or hold them in your hands and never notice. Because they produce so little radiation these isotopes arent really that dangerous to people. You could build your house out of Iron for example and live a perfectly healthy life.Theres also isotopes that have short halflifes in the order of minutes or less. These are extremely dangerous but disappear very quickly too. If there was a box with a kilogram of radioactive waste in your room with a halflife of  minutes youd only have to wait a couple of hours after that it would be safe to enter the room and toss the waste in the bin barehanded.Then theres the decenniarange halflifes which are the nastiest. If you have material with a halflife of say  years it will be a hazard because it gives off significant amounts of radiation on top of that it will also remain radioactive for about a century.

The expansion of the Universe operates on the same basic principles as an object thrown into the air on Earth. So lets think about a baseball. I throw it up. If I dont throw it that hard it will go up for a bit slow down due to gravity and eventually slow to a complete halt. At that point it falls back down to the ground. This is analogous to a universe that expands then recollapses in a big crunch.On the other hand if you throw the ball up hard enough  faster than the escape velocity  it wont ever slow to a complete stop and will just keep moving up and up. This is analogous to a universe that doesnt collapse in a big crunch but keeps expanding forever. Our Universe is very much like this although not exactly like it  we also have something called dark energy which can be fit into this story but requires a bit more thought.So what about the situation where some regions of the Universe have collapsed to form massive objects while the whole keeps expanding? This is like throwing up a whole bunch of baseballs all with slightly varying speeds. The faster ones keep moving up while the slower ones fall to the ground. Those slower ones are like the regions of our Universe that collapsed. And theres no remaining expansion in those regions just like theres no remaining upward motion on the balls that fell back down.So this thing youd heard was a common misconception  the expansion is not some universal force which is overcome locally by gravity. The expansion is an effect of gravity itself and when things arent moving away from each other theres no expansion.,askscience,cxrmyiu,3,t5_2qm4e5890178,0,t3_3vydf2,Thank you for your submission!

Even getting the electrical detonators to work reliably within the simultaneity requirements took months to work out. The other thing to keep in mind here is that standard wartime quality requirements were not as high as for the atomic bomb  if  out of  conventional bombs you drop out of a bomber fail to fuze correctly its not a huge problem but you only have one or two atomic bombs so they needed the failure rate to be almost zero.With modern electronics this sort of thing is more straightforward but they were paving new territory with tolerances that high.

One way of convincing you of this is defining them the wrong way round a complex number is a pair r with r a nonnegative real number and  an angle and multiplication is rr  rr. Then it is easy to see that The set of numbers r behave just like usual real positive numbers with multiplication while r are the negative numbers It is easy to check that    which we said is like the negative number  so  is actually i! Our complex numbers are equivalent to vectors in D so we can add them and we can represent them as a linear combination of any noncollinear vectors so each complex number is really in the form a  bi.A very important fact is the Euler formula which in our notation can be expressed as eix  x. You can understand how this looks way easier than sine and cosine if we use this to describe stuff we only need simple arithmetic and exponentiation rules which are way easier than trigonometric formulas. Or which one do you prefer? eab  ea eb sinab  sinacosb  sinbcosaClearly the former is better and indeed we use complex numbers in electrical engineering to greatly simplify the analysis of AC circuits instead of sines and cosines we use the function eix to represent a sinusoidal waveeven though only the real or the imaginary part has actual physical meaning so a complex currentvoltage not only represents the actual current or voltage but also its phase and differential equations turn into simple arithmetic because eix is that easy to derive. Quantum mechanics uses complex numbers for similar reasons since its all about waves there.,askscience,cyd4mv0,1,t5_2qm4e6053952,0,t1_cycztut,gtYou lost me here though. What exactly isnt correct?I interpreted your phrasing to imply that the moving watch somehow had its experience of time be objectively slower in its own reference frame because it is moving in some absolute way which is a common misconception but it sounds like you understand that is not the case so you can go ahead and just ignore my objection. gtI can perfectly well accept that causality cant have a reference frame if thats the truthIm afraid I dont understand here ... this is the second time youve talked about causality having a reference frame and I really dont think I am grasping what that would mean.  Causality is not an object itself nor is it a measurable quantity or other kind of entity physical or otherwise.  Causality is simply a relationship between two events whereby the cause event necessitates the existence of the effect event.  I dont believe it makes sense for a relationship between two events to have a reference frame ... can you explain a little more about your intended meaning here?gtbut I just... need to know what would physically happen if we tried to force a reference frame to travel the speed of light.Hehe ... then Im afraid you will undoubtedly perish before your need is fulfilled as such a thing is simply not possible.   You can take the limit as you approach c and that limit is indeed zero but the actual quantities are undefined at exactly c in analogy to how the equation x is undefined at x.gtI just have this burning desire to explore and learn and figure out and know these very interesting complex aspects of physics especially when it comes to space and time.I think its good to have that burning desire  never give that up.  But its also important to temper that desire by accepting that some questions simply do not have answers even in principle and also that other questions might actually have answers but those answers are inherently unknowable.  For both practical and theoretical reasons sometimes the answer needs to be there is no answer  much like how in math some systems of linear equations have no solutions!gtgtmassive objects are always travelling at c through spacetimegtActually I quite understand this. Im familiar with spacetime.Er ... are you sure you understood that point?  Notice I said massive not massless.gtgtphotons are always at rest in spacetimegtThis however is making  sense to me.This statement is why I ask whether you understood the former one hehe  since its the same theory that gives rise to both.gtuhh... drool Sorry my brain is melting. Up until now I thought it was a  b  c where a is space b is time and c is spacetime. Im going to need to think about what you said here a bunch before I can give a meaningful reply. Maybe you could expand on this.Sure.  So the actual formula for a spacetime interval is thiss  r  ctwhere s is the spacetime interval r is the spatial distance and t is the temporal distance c is the speed of light just a conversion factor between units. Notice the minus sign in the equation above  that is important as it is the minus sign that guarantees that the quantity s is invariant in all reference frames.  This is related to the signature of the metric for Minkowski spacetime the spacetime manifold used in special relativity.  For a lightlike spacetime interval r and ct are always equal so s is always zero.  The Wikipedia article I linked to previously has a good summary of what a spacetime interval is and why it is important link again for referencegtCertain types of world lines are called geodesics of the spacetime  straight lines in the case of Minkowski space and their closest equivalent in the curved spacetime of general relativity. In the case of purely timelike paths geodesics are locally the paths of greatest separation spacetime interval as measured along the path between two events whereas in Euclidean space and Riemannian manifolds geodesics are paths of shortest distance between two points. The concept of geodesics becomes central in general relativity since geodesic motion may be thought of as pure motion inertial motion in spacetime that is free from any external influences.So in Euclidean space this is basically just the distance between two points.  But in Minkowski space such as used in relativity this invariant quantity is related to inertialgeodesic motion.  Another way of writing the formula above would be to expand r into its three spatial coordinates.  In that case you would gets  x  y  z  ctWhere again you directly see the metric signature at play in the above equation as that is what determines the signs of each squared term.  For Minkowski space the signature is  for a normal dimensional Euclidean space it would simply be  and you would get a purely Pythagorean relationship between each of the coordinates.,askscience,cyd687l,1,t5_2qm4e6054283,0,t1_cyd6qir,We are actually.

This vibrational mode is easily excited by a sound source at that frequency located above the string in that image.If the speaker instead produces a  Hz tone this could potentially excite the second harmonic of our string.  However if the entirety of the string is approximately equidistant to the speaker then the speaker pushes equally on the left and right halves of the string see image.The mode shape of the second harmonic is the left and right halves of the string moving in opposite directions.  One half is moving up while the other moves down then they reverse directions.  Pushing on both halves in the same direction therefore does not excite this mode.If the speaker produces a  Hz tone it would excite the third harmonic of our string.  Because this vibrational mode is lopsided  of the string is moving upwards while  is moving downwards then the directions reverse it is still easily excited by a relatively distant sound source.A  Hz tone corresponds to the fourth harmonic but because this again involves exactly half the string moving upwards while the other half moves downwards it shouldnt be excited much by a relatively distant sound source.,askscience,cyejoxx,5,t5_2qm4e6067185,0,t1_cyczygh,removed,askscience,cyewd4a,1,t5_2qm4e6069353,0,t1_cyf4bzn,I keep wanting to say more things.

In that case the mass is believed to be zero for all the reasons outlined elsewhere in other peoples posts.  However in addition to rest mass you can also talk about the relativistic mass of a particle.  A photon does have an associated energy and energy always carries with it a certain amount of mass as given by Einsteins famous equation E  mc.  Since the energy of a photon is given by E  hf we can figure out the mass that the photon carries a very small amount that is proportional to the frequency of the photon.

Note there are functions whose derivative is not continuous If Cab is all differentiable functions on the interval ab and Cab then we can view differentiation as a function DCabgtCab. This map is not an isomorphism as fxx and gxx are sent to the same function hx. Ie we have DfDgh and f!g.Typically we view integration as a linear function from the set of continuous functions on the interval ab call it Cab into the real numbers. If a or b are infinity we need to adjust things a bit. This is definitely an onto function but it is not injective. Many functions can have the same area underneath them.If differentiation and integration are not isomorphisms how can we say that they are inverses of each other? Lets make a new function from the continuous function on ab Cab into the differentiable functions on ab Cab. This function will take the continuous function Fx and output the function fxIntegral from tc to tx of Ftdt. Since this depends on the starting point c lets call this function Ic. Now the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that fIcF is an antiderivative of F. This means that DfF. Since this works for all F in Cab it follows that DIcIdentity. How can this be? D is definitely not an isomorphism yet it looks like we have an inverse? It also turns out that Ic is not unique I can change c to get different functions yet they all satisfy this relationship. It turns out that if you compose them in the opposite direction IcD you do not get the identity function. The function IcDf is just be a function that has the same derivative of f but it doesnt have to be f. We call Ic then a section of D.As an aside...Indefinite Integrals are poorly named things. The indefinite integral of a function is just the collection of all antiderivatives of a function. It really has nothing to do with integration. If F is a function in Cab then the indefinite integral of F is the inverse image of the set F ie DF. Its just that if we can find one function f in the set DF then any other function in the indefinite integral will be of the form gxfxc for some real number c. This means that as long as we know one antiderivative fx then we can write the indefinite integral as  DFfxc | c is a real numberTo avoid having to write this clunky notation we just simply write fxc where the c means that it is understood that we mean the entire set fxc | c is a real number. So indefinite integrals are not functions and they have nothing to do with integrals. In the special case that Fx is continuous the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus gives us a recipe to find a single antiderivate as the function fxIntegral from tc to tx of Ftdt is an antiderivative when altcltb. So all antiderivatives of F are of the form fxC. In other words the different sections Ic pick out different representatives of of the indefinite integral. But morally indefinite integrals are not integrals.,askscience,cyhxt6o,6,t5_2qm4e6092258,0,t3_3yzk0v,removed,askscience,cyi4kmb,1,t5_2qm4e6092312,0,t3_3yzy4h,removed,askscience,cyi4skz,1,t5_2qm4e6093289,0,t3_3z0ht6,removed,askscience,cyi8sr0,1,t5_2qm4e6094286,0,t1_cyi4gmc,I had the exact same experience I got a hole of a fx as well without knowing the pin was broken.

But here is a trick in text mining one way would be to use naive bayes classification which effectively treats all of the factors as independent and its much easier to estimate the conditional probabilities this way. However as you can imagine there are many scenarios where this wouldnt lead to accurate estimations.Same thing with our minds and I see people do this all the time. Take for example on reddit there was a gif posted of a guy trying to close the glass door while a gunman was chasing after him. And so the the gunman blasts him through the glass door no problem.So what do you think some people commented along the lines of this guy isnt intelligent if he thought he could hide behind a glass door. But this is exactly where they had messed up in their way of thinking they are claiming they understand what was going through the guys mind.In which they recollect on possibly similar moments in their life nothing like a gunman but maybe an enraged person. They thought in this instance they wouldnt try holding a paper in front of this enraged guy would be pointless therefore the guy in the gif should of had a similar natural instinct. However they didnt think of combination effects there is a combination effect of panic and what kind of state of mind which gets loss in the above thinking similar to assuming independence and losing structure. If they were actually in a situation where a gunman is chasing them possibly already wounded they cant accurately understand what they would have done in that situation,askscience,cymgwam,5,t5_2qm4e6131002,0,t1_cymbes3,But what if the series of same results is pointing to something that is causing the same result such as the amount of force produced by my thumb as I flip the coin?,askscience,cymj4or,1,t5_2qm4e6131341,0,t1_cylxlnk,removed,askscience,cymkijj,1,t5_2qm4e6131401,0,t1_cym379z,removed,askscience,cymkrcp,1,t5_2qm4e6131963,0,t3_3zghfk,It really depends on the philosophy you use... both ways are right this is really a matter of what is the truth and since this does not exist....

Now because all individual outcomes have equal probability the probability that the outcome belongs to some class of outcomes is directly proportional to the size of that class. Since there are only very few outcomes that are allsequential such as  or  or  the probability that the outcome will be any of these sequential ones is much lower than the probability that it wont be. The incorrect conclusion is that you should therefore avoid picking sequential numbers. It is incorrect because you still have to correctly pick the actual outcome. You dont get any reward for correctly predicting whether or not the outcome will be sequential or not. I can show that with a simple example. Imagine you have two dice one is colored red one is colored blue. There are      different outcomes for rolling those die and each of these outcomes has the same probability. Note Im talking about individual outcomes not the sum of the eyes. That is rolling a  and  is different from rolling a  and a . And because of the different colors rolling a  on the red and a  on the blue is different from rolling a  on the red and a  on the blue.So lets say you get rewarded for exactly predicting the dice roll What does the red one show what does the blue one show?In that case any guess is as good as any other! The lottery fallacy then would be to say But having both die show the same number of eyes is less likely than having them show different numbers. Therefore you should pick different numbers. It is correct that out of the  outcomes theres only  outcomes that show the same number of eyes on both dice. But so what? The chance for  is     . Same as the chance for . Or .If you want to get fancy you can do some math with conditional probabilities and then see that they cancel out The chance to get same eyes is .

Its not obvious to me that such a method would be useful even if it existed. All mixtures are contaminated by small amounts of basically everything and having a device that detects those impurities would not help my work at all. For instance every liter of surface water groundwater and tap water in Europe contains a few nanograms of cocaine a fun fact that is utterly irrelevant in nearly all applications. The closest weve come to an allinone detector is I think mass spectrometry coupled to some kind of chromatography. You stick a few drops of the mixture into the machine then the components are separated in the chromatographic column then the mass spectrometer ionizes them and reads out a mass spectrum. With perfect separation which is impossible arbitrary mass resolution even more impossible a detection limit of  probably possible! and preexisting knowledge of the retention times mass spectra and detector efficiencies of every species in existence laughably impossible I think you could conclusively quantify everything down to the individual atom. In a more realistic world you have to choose some species to look for say mercury or dopamine and then choose a tool appropriate for quantifying it say plasma mass spectrometry or voltammetry.,askscience,cyywcxq,1,t5_2qm4e6240843,0,t1_cyyzzta,Thanks a lot,askscience,cyz0lla,1,t5_2qm4e6241143,0,t3_412ill,Thank you for your submission!

The interaction cross section of neutrinos increases rapidly with energy For example the electroweak cross section electronneutrino  electron scattering rises from e mb ate eV typical of neutrinos from supernovas to e mb at e eV particle accelerators to e mb at .e eV Wparticle resonance. So the latter kind of neutrino interacts  billion times more readily and deposits much more energy as it does so.Such highenergy neutrinos are not just a theoretical footnote. The Ice Cube neutrino observatory has observed neutrinos up to e eV and the muons in the proposed muon collider would decay to neutrinos with sufficient energy and flux that they would actually poses a significant radiation hazardSo if you wanted to kill somebody with neutrinos one way would be to build a huge muon accelerator pointed at their house and let the resulting highenergy neutrino stream give them radiation poisoning. It would be among the most impractical and expensive forms of assassination possible. And unlike lowenergy neutrino beams this one wouldnt have the advantage that it can fly though the whole earth without stopping. The same high cross section that would make this beam dangerous unhealthy also makes it relatively easy to stop it. If I recall correctly km of soil will remove most of it. So the collider would have to be built next door to the victim too.,askscience,cz1hjpt,1,t5_2qm4e6264696,0,t3_41epc7,Hi ZulDjin thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Pregnant women arent immunosuppressed in the same way that an AIDS patient a leukemia patient or someone with a congenital immunodeficiency is.  The effects of pregnancy on the immune system are significant but much more mild than the extreme cases I just listed.This study shows that lymphoma risk one of the most worrying effects of true immunosuppression is if anything decreased by having more children In fact pregnancy can reduce the risk of some cancers breastovarianendometrial are the best studied that are related to estrogen exposure in other words women who never have children are at higher risk.  This is thought to be because pregnancy temporarily stops the monthly cycle and you dont get the accompanying estrogen bump instead you stay in a progesteroneheavy state for  months.  Longer length of breast feeding also is a factor for the same reason.  Thats all an extreme oversimplification and not always the case but you get the idea.This study suggests that pregnancy decreases risk of colon cancer However more pregnancies can increase the risk of cervical cancerTheres lots of theories on that it could be because you generally have to have unprotected sex to get pregnant so more pregnancies is more chances for exposure to HPV.  It could be related to hormonal changes in pregnancy.  And some do suspect it could be the pregnancyinduced immune depression.

And since orbit is the qualification for being part of the solar system the edge of the solar system could be defined at some spherical point where an object and the sun exert enough gravity on each other to maintain a stable orbit around the sun but the relationship is not the opposite and the objects have less gravity than the sun.  For example the galactic center would not be considered part of the solar system since the sun is orbiting it.  But in reality you probably would have already found evidence of an object that would be large enough to produce fusion of deuterium i.e. a star which would emit energy we could detect easily.  And conveniently the definition of a planet at the largest end of the spectrum is something that does not have enough mass to produce fusion.  So if you take the largest possible planet and the Sun and find the furthest point where their interacting gravity can maintain an orbit that would be the real theoretical edge of the solar system.  Anything beyond this point would have to be emitting energy as a star to be large enough to maintain an orbit around the sun e.g. a binary solar system and we know we dont have that.Unfortunately I dont have the knowledge necessary to calculate this distance without a lot of research but maybe someone else does.Edit oh and youd have to take into account the escape velocity of such an object and balance that with the gravitational forces to find that theoretical limit.  Note that this limit might not be a single point in a sphere but a range of distances based on the velocity and mass of the theoretical edge object and youd then have to find the outer limit.

First off any piece of software can be compiled on any machine provided someone has built a compiler to generate the proper set of instructions corresponding to the program this includes operating systems. I should mention there are also two ways to do this. The first involves compiling the program right there on the computer itself. The second is called crosscompiling which involves identifying important environment settings of the machine the program will run on and compiling the code into an executable which can just be transferred and run on that machine.Now to answer your questions.The main morale of the story is and as few people have mentioned here ARM prioritizes literal power efficiency in Watts whereas traditional x architectures prioritize performance. Things like this  are now on the rise. They are embedded boards that behave exactly like a desktop computer. You can install full on Ubuntu . for it if youd like. These things are definitely on the rise but they can be much more of a headache to work with. For example compiling large programs on them is a little slow which means sometimes you want to cross compile programs for it this process is not fun. When building them they do use something along the lines of flops per what when benchmarking and comparing. The issue is ARM processors are designed with a different issue in mind. I dont see them replacing all x based architectures because you will just have instances were performance is much more important than power. Even if x stops becoming fruitful relative to ARM who is to say that a new architecture wont be created to push out the performance ceiling.

Instead all the noise it produces is one continuous oscillation of the air pressure around it which produces all the sounds you can hear. If this fact sounds surprising it will appear more clear when you go back and think about how sound works in the first place. A sound wave is simply a pressure wave as shown in this diagram where areas of low pressure follow areas of high pressure in a specific way. Because the speaker and your ears are separated by the same medium the air these pressure changes must encode all the sound information that you can hear. So now how does that work with different sounds? Well if you hear sound from two sources then what your ear will pick up is actually the sum of the waves from each source. This idea is called the superposition principle In other words the two sounds will effectively stack and what you get is what we call the waveform which shows how the sound pressure varies in time which may look something like this. A good speaker will then be able to take this waveform and turn into pressure oscillations around it which your ears will then pick up and your brain will recognize as the original sounds.,askscience,cz8znty,13,t5_2qm4e6328740,0,t3_42av75,Here is an answer from when this question was asked previously. ,askscience,cz90b9y,82,t5_2qm4e6329646,0,t1_cz92ttr,This might help.

That means there is a thermodynamic equilibrium for freezing of a submixture of this mixture. Likewise for a frozen mixture its complement is the first to melt. For polymers and their gels it is common for the apparent melting point and freezing point to differ substantially for tens of degrees depending on composition. This is because polymers consist of molecules of multiple molar masses which are technically different substances. Also for substances that are pure the real purity is often something like  which is definitely not .For the distinction between thermodynamics and kinetics for a material to freeze it must undergo the reaction of crystallization or solidification. This has its own kinetics. For a simple molecule it is usually pretty fast but for polymers it can take even months for a material to relax to its thermodynamic ground state.For frozen gels dont necessarily have just solid and liquid states since they dont actually crystallize. This means there isnt that much of melting point but a solgel transition point where the storage modulus quantifying elasticity is equal to the loss modulus quantifying plasticity or ability to flow. In effect this softening from a stiff fully elastic material from a flowing liquid can take tens of degrees with a smooth transition between them.,askscience,cz94jzd,1,t5_2qm4e6329805,0,t1_cz942xw,removed,askscience,cz94nya,1,t5_2qm4e6329995,0,t1_cz949nb,Low Energy Nuclear Reactions is another way of saying cold fusion.

However a sinusoid is more than just a frequency it is a frequency and a phase. This is often not the most convenient expression to work with so you can apply a trig identity and instead represent the sinusoid as a sinewave plus a cosine each having the same frequency but a different amplitude. This is also not the most convenient expression to work with so you can apply Eulers identity and write the sinusoid as a complex exponential. There is your esomething.The transform gives the amount of the function present at a given frequency. This is obtained by correlating the function with a sinusoid of the frequency of interest.

It can also consist of the materials used to generate the explosion but this isnt that big a factor. This radioactive material is pushed into the upper atmosphere and will fall gradually depending on meteorological conditions. Many people within buildings will be sheltered from the blast so long as they arent too close to the point of detonation saving them from very horrible burns. Frankly the best way to endure fallout is to get away from the area if you have a rapid means of transport from rescue. If you are stuck? Stay underground or in shelters. Dont drink any exposed water which can and probably is contaminated and take shelter within buildings and basements which will offer the most protection from gamma radiation. Underground is best the more material between you and possible fallout the less radiation you are exposed to. In this situation any well covering clothes will protect you from Alpha radiation which cannot penetrate far at all. Gamma radiation is the more dangerous possible form of exposure. In nuclear facilities any personnel who are at significant risk of exposure to radioactive material wear clothing that covers them fully and are thoroughly decontaminated this is really just a shower that washes off as much material as possible that may have got on you. There is no dietary or nutritional treatment for ingestion of radioactive material that will make any meaningful difference. Fallout will decay rapidly with the first several hours being the most intense possible radiation exposure. This is one of the reasons its best to either not be there or be underground if you can minimise the exposure early on youre in a much better condition. ,askscience,czbowq7,2,t5_2qm4e6354494,0,t1_czbqwaa,gt Do gravitrons just travel in a straight line forever?

Theres a concept called Amdahls Law which relates speedup to increasing resources usually by adding multiple processors or analogously making a singlethreaded program multithreaded on a multicore machine.  Generally only part of a program can be improved by increasing parallelism parts of it are still effectively serial.Theres a cost to increasing parallelism.  Synchronization mechanisms are generally expensive for multiple reasons.  Sometimes you have to wait for threads to all reach the same point before you can continue which can lead to threads just waiting around.  And even assuming youre using a welldesigned locking algorithm without much contention locks generally require memory barriers which force the processor to finish executing all instructions up to the barrier superscalar system  In applications where theres not much to be gained from parallelizing the computation these overheads can be substantial enough to make the parallelization not worth it.,askscience,czc3vtk,8,t5_2qm4e6356479,0,t1_czc4zkp,removed,askscience,czc5tzc,1,t5_2qm4e6356612,0,t1_czbbixa,I think the biggest misconception about the range being infinite is that graphically speaking after a certain point the curvature of the equivalent equation approaches towards infinity. That also means that as distance increases so do the affects. One of my professors used an example of a bowling ball on a large bedsheet thats been drawn tight and dropping it into the middle of the bedsheet. Now imagine that bedsheet is the size of a small town. Sure it may cause an indent in the bedsheet where it landed but the sheet will still be pretty unaffected the further away from the ball is. Gravity is better thought of as a foamy fabric than as a force as it affects the very foundation upon which particles rest which we refer to as space.

If youve ever seen a very tall flagpole you probably know how much those move around at the top.

They can mimic the interactions of the transition state but without the added molecular strains involved in an actual reaction. For example you can have a tetrahedral hemiacetal to mimic the transition state of a carbonyl.So the pertinent part of the diagram to draw attention to should be the dip in the ES and EP complexes which more closely describe the interactions youre alluding to. The hump while being the actual transition state describes why it is chemically unfavourable to be in that state  because it is a transition state of a reaction. So a diagram like this one shows a more detailed energy landscape of the binding event.,askscience,czlm25n,3,t5_2qm4e6443404,0,t3_43vx7k,abstract in what sense? there are men and women everywhere...,askscience,czlsd6m,1,t5_2qm4e6444082,0,t3_43wqok,removed,askscience,czluwd6,0,t5_2qm4e6446924,0,t1_czjxo4o,The steam has to be as dry as possible because else the salts in the water will corrode the turbine at the temperatures it runs at.,askscience,czm5hee,1,t5_2qm4e6448255,0,t1_czm93bn,removed,askscience,czmafst,1,t5_2qm4e6452976,0,t3_440dpk,removed,askscience,czms2lh,1,t5_2qm4e6453077,0,t1_czmqcud,removed,askscience,czmsg51,1,t5_2qm4e6453189,0,t1_czms1hd,Well try most everything from Asimov.

The most general summary is that acetylation promotes open DNA aka active or euchromatic chromatin while methylation promotes both open or closed DNA aka repressive or heterochromatic chromatin depending on the kind of methylation.  Generally all modifications work by attracting additional factors other proteins and transcription factors so the effect of the modification will depend on the function of the proteins it attracts.  Additionally acetylation may promote open chromatin by neutralizing the histones positive charge making it less attractive to the negatively charged DNA.So while we can generalize about acetylation and assume that it usually promotes open DNA unfortunately you cant do the same with methylation. The only way I can remember what some of them do is by reading about them all the time but there are a few that are more commonly studied.  For example HKme attracts the repressive protein HP HKme attracts the repressive Polycomb proteins HKme is activating and found at promoters HKme is activating and found within gene bodies.There are many of relevant review articles from just the past few years that discuss these things Ill link to a few recent ones The interplay of histone modifications  writers that read. EMBO Rep.  Chromatin dynamics interplay between remodeling enzymes and histone modifications. Biochim Biophys Acta.  Comprehensive Catalog of Currently Documented Histone Modifications.

As a writer whose current project deals a lot with memory this is a topic Im very keen on learning more about. I have a few questions which Im not sure can be answered definitively but Id love to hear your thoughts about Im interested in your thoughts regarding the implantation of false memories in individuals whose memory is already impaired in some way. For example in cases of anterograde amnesia Im thinking  specifically of cases like Henry Molaison would implanting a new memory be impossible due to the the inability to form new memories? Would amnesia then be a kind of defense against memory implantation? Or can these false memories be planted directly into what wed call longterm memory?  Also and this may be a bit of a baselevel question what were the bounds of the memory implantation? How close to the present could these false memories be implanted? Could you take someone from room A to room B and implant a false memory of an event that occurred in Room A? Could it be about someone they knew very well? Could the event have been something theyve already recalled several times or was the act of true recollection a defense against this of false implantation? sort of the opposite of the above line of thinking Additionally Im curious as to whether or not you noted any negative effects on an individuals ability to operate in the present and future. If we think of memory as retrieving stored information about past events were there any increased doubts in regards to the storing of present or future events?

The record currently belongs to a group in Finland who cooled down a piece of rhodium metal to pK To realize how cold that is that is K or just . degrees above the absolute zero!As for how such low temperatures are actually achieved in lab things here get a bit more complicated but since you asked... The cooling is usually done in multiple stages for practical reasons. At earlier stages you just pump a cold gas such as nitrogen or helium to quickly cool the sample down to K or K in this case. Next you use a second stage which may be similar to your refrigerator at home where you allow the expansion of a gas to such out the heat from a system. Finally the last stage is usually something fancier including a variety of magnetic refrigeration techniques For example the Finns I mentioned above used something called nuclear demagnetization to achieve this effect. While that name sounds complicated in reality the scheme looks something like this The basic idea is that  you put a chunk of metal in a magnetic field which makes the spins in the metal align and which heats up the material.  You allow the heat to dissipate by transferring it to a coolant.  You separate the metal and coolant and the spins reshuffle again absorbing the thermal energy in the process so you end up with something colder than what you started out with.By the way to get back to your original question when cool something this low the cosmic background radiation is the least of your worries unless you are in deep space. Here on Earth there are for more important thermal sources you have to fight against.,askscience,d071igy,46,t5_2qm4e6649488,0,t1_d0739kk,removed,askscience,d074506,1,t5_2qm4e6651219,0,t1_d077gt2,gt a letter alphanumeric password has    trillionWouldnt a letter alphanumeric have either  or  depending on whether case matters?,askscience,d07akrw,2,t5_2qm4e6654137,0,t1_d07bb59,So if I stuck my finger in supercooled water Id basically have my finger stuck in a block of ice immediately?,askscience,d07lg14,42,t5_2qm4e6654924,0,t1_d07lou3,removed,askscience,d07odlx,1,t5_2qm4e6654973,0,t1_d07ghz4,Gravitational waves squeeze and stretch space transverse to the direction of propagation of the wave and in such a way that preserves volume. They can transfer energy through mechanisms like the one in Feynmans sticky beads thought experiment where something that is free to move gets pushed and pulled along something that is not free to move which can result in dissipation of energy from the gravitational wave through frictional effects.However in the absence of such frictional dissipation which is in reality quite contrived given the extremely tiny amplitude of gravitational waves outside the immediate vicinity of cataclysmic astronomical events then there is no net transfer of energy from a gravitational wave to the matter that it passes through just like there is no net transfer of energy from an ocean wave to a buoy floating on the water.For the same reason its thought that gravitational waves should not have been limited by the opacity of the early universe and so should in principle it should be possible to detect the gravitational waves produced in the very earliest moments of the universe even earlier than the supposed neutrino background  possibly even from the very beginning depending on high energyquantum effects that we are obviously ignorant about. This is essentially the same argument that based on our current models of quantum gravity it is basically impossible to directly detect a graviton i.e. to absorb one removing energy from the gravitational wave. If you had a perfectly efficient detector the size of Jupiter in a close orbit around a neutron star youd only expect to see only one event every  to  years which would be indistinguishable from the vastly larger background signal from neutrinos which are in practice impossible to shield your jupitersized detector from for obvious reasons.Gravitational waves can in principle lose energy as it passes through matter but in practice the effect is extremely tiny even by the standards of gravitational waves. ,askscience,d07ok5o,2,t5_2qm4e6655001,0,t3_46t7sp,Hi fakeyfakefakefaker thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

The designers were no going beyond just fighting deflection and aiming for stability to tuning the rubber compound which could be different in different parts of the tyre to deflect in a calculated and desirable way. This could be used to make the tyre heat up quickly a cold tyre is dangerous on a motorcycle but then hold a steady temperature.A recent development has been silica additive in the rubber which helps wet weather adhesion and grip generally without having to necessarily use a soft rubber. So more tyre life for a given amount of grip.Computers were now helping design too. Kevlar was lighter less circulating mass and stronger. Some tyres were made not with a fabric sandwich but with single strands of Kevlar precisely embedded in the rubber.  In the mids tyres became much lighter.For your car old rubber goes hard and becomes dangerous.,askscience,d0bkuda,15,t5_2qm4e6694121,0,t1_d0bcbdz,Ive got as anyone else no idea on the real answer but I always saw time as a constant flow and we just got with it experiencing the current state of where we find ourselves in the flow.,askscience,d0bqays,1,t5_2qm4e6696478,0,t1_d0byh21,removed,askscience,d0bz2dk,1,t5_2qm4e6702160,0,t1_d0cdjmd,Why cant humans develop resistance to being carried away by a tsunami like we can to various diseases?It depends on whether your point of attack is an evolvable trait.

A black hole is the solution to the field equations under certain precise conditions. For instance a Schwarzschild black hole is a solution based on the assumption of spherical symmetry a Kerr black hole is a solution based on the assumption of axisymmetry etc. A single particle moving on some path with some velocity lets forget that velocity of faraway objects is not defined in GR has neither of these symmetries and so the solution to the field equations cannot be attained in the same way.If you want to use these solutions you have to boost into a frame which has the required symmetries. If the particle has zero proper acceleration we can boost into a locally inertial frame in which the object is at rest. Now we can use spherical symmetry or whatever other condition you want. Its not a black hole in this frame so its not a black hole in any frame.This is somewhat related to the common question why did the universe not collapse into a black hole at the big bang? Short answer the conditions at the big bang are not the same as those of a spherically symmetric mass in a vacuum. So you should not expect the two solutions to be the same.,askscience,d0fxggt,44,t5_2qm4e6736966,0,t3_47y2ge,Thank you for your submission!

The problem is that the advantages it has over Earthbased solar cells the ability to initially collect more light are more than offset by its drawbacks especially the complicated equipment and the high installationoperational costs. If you want to dig deeper lets start by looking at how SBSP would work in practice. The basic idea behind such a system is summarized in this diagram. First large solar cell arrays possibly aided by additional concentrating mirrors would collect sunlight in space converting this energy to electricity.. The electricity would be used to pump another emitter of EM radiation towards the Earth e.g. in the microwave range.. Receivers on Earth would convert this energy back to electricity.AdvantagesSBSP does have certain important advantages.  First much of incoming solar energy  is lost through atmospheric absorptionreflection even before it can reach the ground as shown here Collecting the energy in space would bypass this problem boosting the energy that could be collected.  In addition the satellites could collect light close to hrs so again you can collect more energy each day.ProblemsHowever the problem is that there also several important drawbacks that have made this technology largely impractical.  There will be significant energy losses in going from EM radiation gt electricity gt EM radiation gt electricity.  The final beam received on Earth will be very large on the order of kms making collection challenging.  There are huge costs associated with sending these panels out in space and maintaining them.All in all so far the cons have made this technology prohibitive especially the cost aspect. Personally I dont see this math changing in the foreseeable future. All in all sticking to solar panels here on Earth makes a lot more sense for now.  ,askscience,d0jcht2,52,t5_2qm4e6767850,0,t3_48edsu,removed,askscience,d0jezf7,1,t5_2qm4e6768366,0,t1_d0j59i8,How dangerous would an ice covered equator be to cross?

That would still be .Nope. One head and one tails is twice as likely as HH.I think the issue is that you are fixing one of the coins as H then thinking that the other coin has a  chance. Thats not the whole story.To separate it out think of there being a game show with two contestants. A random coin flipper determines who wins  H for a win and T for a loss. However it throws out any outcome with more than one winner. If no H appear then the host wins.There are only three outcomes each equally likely person  wins person  wins or the host wins. So  chance that someone wins.If you have  contestants maybe its even more clear. There are  possibilities each equally likely  either one of the  wins or the host wins. So  likelihood that one of the contestants wins.Maybe a better analogy would be lets say you have a random number generator thats  digits and you Lets say its a nickel and a dime. If you require the nickel to be heads then yes it is  that the dime will be heads.But that isnt the requirement.

Right?,askscience,d0le7hm,1,t5_2qm4e6786102,0,t3_48ozfn,Its sort of complicated because it involves electron capture.Consider a free neutron for example. It can decay into a proton by emitting an electron because the total massenergy of a proton plus an electron is less than the massenergy of a free neutron. However its also necessary to keep lepton number balanced so an antielectron neutrino is also generated which has very low restmass so its a trivial component to the reaction. Similarly its possible for a big nucleus with excess protons to decay by emitting an antielectron positron as well as an electronneutrino converting a proton into a neutron in the process.The equivalent reaction to emitting an antielectron is absorbing or capturing an electron. That can happen if theres not enough excess massenergy in the nucleus to make emission of a positron possible.Anyway what happens is that a proton and an electron combine producing a neutron while emitting an electronneutrino. But things dont stop there because the system is not yet in a low energy state. Firstly you have a lot of excess energy in the nucleus which will get emitted as one or more gamma rays. But youve also got an empty slot in the electron shell around the atom due to the loss of the captured electron often in a very low energy shell. Another electron will fall into that shell and the electrons will reconfigure themselves until theyre in the lowest energy state. But electrons changing energy also releases energy in the form of photons and because an electron very near the nucleus is the most likely to be captured this can be a lot of energy which can be absorbed by other electrons and is potentially enough to cause other electrons to be ejected from the atom.All in all this leads to a variety of things being emitted by the atom. A neutron gamma rays several other photons ranging in energy up to xrays and highenergy Auger electrons. For Iodine an average of about  Auger electrons are emitted during a decay for example nearly  of all the electrons the atom has.,askscience,d0lhpqf,7,t5_2qm4e6788940,0,t1_d0lqudl,removed,askscience,d0ltc00,2,t5_2qm4e6788969,0,t3_48oyk5,Genuine question so please dont hate on me too much.Ive not read the article but I was just wondering what the problem is with a scientific journal publishing something suggesting a theory of evidence for some kind of creator?Isnt science about considering all the options?

Some of the physics of these islands is independent of device so that by doing research on one configuration others are better understood.

Well firstly we can observe that points are getting further apart from each other. Galaxies are getting further from each other and they get further from each other evenly in a way that there is no center but the distances get longer constantly everywhere.Secondly we can measure how light traveling in space is itself stretching. Like if you have an elastic fabric and you draw an one centimeter wave on it. Now if you stretch that fabric the wave on the fabric also gets longer. We can measure this happening to light which travels in space.gtWhat if its just light longer to travel those distances.Light has a constant speed. So light always travels with the same speed. So if light takes longer to travel its because distances are longer.gtMaybe time is changing?Time is relative itself so it changes according to the frame of reference and speed. For example time in the ISS moves at a different speed than time on Earth.gtWhat is matter is shrinking?If matter would be shrinking all the known fundamental forces should be weakening too for example electromagnetism should be getting at the same rate matter is shrinking. Likewise gravity should be getting weaker constantly. This is not the case.gtAll we know is that something is changing in relation to something else we think we know.Science as a whole is what we think we know. Science is a theoretical model explaining observations. The idea of space expanding is the best theoretical model which explains the observations the best.

So lets say that the Sun delivers  units of energy to a bunch of vegetables. If we feed those vegetables to some pigs those pigs arent  efficient. They might only end up with  units of energy. And humans arent  efficient either. If we eat those pigs we might end up with just  unit of energy. So energy is lost with each step you take.If we stopped eating meat it means we would no longer have to breed a lot of animals. So instead of providing energy for those animals and then eating THEM we can cut out the middle man. Get rid of the pigs and just have humans eat the vegetables.In the first scenario the Sun provides  units of energy to a patch of vegetables. Then  is lost to in the transfer to pigs and  is lost in the transfer to humans  gt  gt . That patch of vegetables only provided humans with  unit of energy.

The velocity of the bullet would be  ms sqrt   compared to  for the ISS so it might not reach enough atmosphere to matter and instead would go into an orbit slightly more elliptical than the ISS.To look at it another way it would take about  minutes for something going  ms to go  km. During that time the horizontal velocity will take it around  km so thats like  degrees around the orbit which means the Earth has fallen away by very roughly  km. Thats a really rough estimate but I think it means that the bullet wouldnt be able to make up in downward velocity what its losing in horizontal velocity so the altitude would never get low enough to hit the atmosphere.

Im a vet tech in a clinic that specializes in repairing this injury specifically. There are typically two types of repairs one referred to as the traditional where the ACL is replaced with an artificial nylon ligament less effective the other called the TPLO Tibial Plateau Levelling Osteotomy. I believe veterinarians require some very specialized training and equipment to perform a TPLO so depending on where youre living it may be more difficult to find a specialist. Now Im not sure if your dog is still with you or this happened quite some time ago but the TPLO usually results in full recovery and a return to athletic ability. I see it every day its wonderful! If not treated the joint will develop osteoarthritis incredibly fast due to something called tibial thrust. The surgery shouldnt be horribly painful for your dog if your veterinarian has good drug protocols. The downside is the surgery is expensive and dogs are incredibly likely to tear the other ACL at some point.

Some vaccines target viruses some bacteria and others target only the toxins produced by the infectious organism. There have been sporadic successes of vaccines to treat cancer as well but there arent any large scale successes.Older vaccines werent designed so much as developed. Passing an infection through an animal that doesnt normally get infected can generate weaker strains or strains of virus from other animals can be close enough to protect people without actively infecting them cowpoxsmallpox. Trial and error can isolate some toxins like tetanus or diptheria that can be treated to no longer harm us but still allow our immune system to recognize them. Bacteria and whole viruses can be killed in gentle ways that leave structures intact and used as vaccines as well.For the most part these older methods have more antigens and unneeded extra proteins etc. that make them much more likely to cause reactions like fever or pain and swelling at the injection site.Most vaccines developed now try to use parts of the organism that are thought to be good targets. We know what parts of proteins by sequence that the immune system tends to recognize and we often know which protein structures are on the surface and needed for infection. Combine one or a few of those pieces into a vaccine and hopefully the body will develop specific defences to prevent infection. The problem is its not a perfect science. Fewer antigens make it easier for the infectious organism to mutate and evade. Often the vaccine doesnt raise a response or the response doesnt work. Rarely it can make things worse and raise a response that doesnt work but interferes with generating a new protective response or causes autoimmunity etc.If small parts fail and its possible to grow the virus in culture mutants that only grow in culture or are severely defective are sometimes used live chickenpox vaccine.Influenza is down to a kind of science. We know which proteins change to make new strains we know which ones are protective and we know how to make tons of them for vaccination. The hard part is have only months to figure out which strain is coming and make all the vaccine.There are other methods but I think those are the main ones. The other important thing is these vaccines are tested at every step for safety and effectiveness. Unless its something like ebola where the risks of infection and death to people in active areas are so high. So getting vaccinated is an incredibly low risk even compared to the risk of getting something like measles that is almost wiped out in many countries.,askscience,d19byu7,2,t5_2qm4e6996659,0,t1_d18y3b5,We do have UDPIP ICMPIP and many other IP based protocols which are not TCP.

So if we now dump a bunch of fresh water into this area of the ocean it could theoretically cap off the area and stop the salty water from forming and sinking thus disrupting the overturning current.,askscience,d1azqxi,2,t5_2qm4e7014110,0,t1_d1axvdk,removed,askscience,d1beblp,11,t5_2qm4e7015129,0,t3_4bqlve,Hi Neguse thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

And therefore that a transistor doesnt work based on entanglement.  Or perhaps that entanglement is not an essential ingredient in the operation of a transistor.The Fermi energy of something like a semiconductor is on the order of a few eV lets say  eV to be the most conservative.  The thermal energy at room temperature is about . eV. If your picture of what band theory is is just bands  no PEP then your idea of band theory is a bunch of Fermions sitting   kT below this fabled band gap after all if its a  kT jump it might as well be fantasy to them and doing basically nothing.  The number of carriers in the conduction band is effectively zero for all intents and purposes an electron would need to have  kT to get up there . eV is the bandgap of silicon.  It aint happening.  If this is band theory then okay.  But this band theory has nothing to do with what happens in a semiconductor channel in reality.If instead we consider band theory as an idea brought up in regards to transistor technology and lasers to be some idea of weakly interacting electrons with an effective mass and parabolic dispersions then PEP and thus entanglement is an enormous part of the story.In a nutshell if youre John Bardeen and youre writing down a model for transport in this thing youre inventing what is that math?

So do the phospholipids that compose the lipid bilayer of cell membranes of all living things. When exposed to these molecules dissolved in water the membranes incorporate them into their structure disrupting normal chain packing destabilizing the bilayer causing it to break like a bubble. The cornea of the eye that covers the front has only a singlecell thick very thin and fragile epithelium covering it and below that a crystalline meshwork of collagen fibers within which penetrate and arborize naked nerve endings. Some of these easily accessed endings detect painful stimuli and when activated lead to the experience of pain. The soap breaks down the epithelium and diffuses to the nerve endings for pain located a few hundred microns below the surface disrupting them.

If Coriolis and Euler forces are involved I assume youre talking about a rotating frame of reference about earth if Im wrong please do correct me. In which case again Im assuming that space itself is applying some kind of force to keep the planets in their epicycles. This still wouldnt explain the force behind the planets bouncing wildly perpendicular to the celestial equator. If the same force is involved space itself is not only rotating but seesawing around parallel to the ecliptic.This whole thing raises three main problems which I can see Why doesnt this rotating and bouncing space cause any noticable change in the atmosphere. This force extends out to the far reaches of the solar system Id expect to see space exerting a force on it in this case. Even if the strength is directly proportional to the distance from earth it should be measurable. Weve not detected any such uniform global windspeed. It could be abused heartily by satellites. Why not let the space do the work of carrying your satellite into orbit? Point your rocket away from earth launch your satellite into space and watch as it heads west without changing the direction of thrust circling earth once a day. Clearly this doesnt happen. How does gravity or the EM force the only two forces relevant in this case explain any of this? They explain attraction between two objects. What kind of objects generates a field like this? To use the previous diagram what object goes in the center of a planets rotation or indeed the suns? How can we detect them? On a related note what is the mechanism by which space seesaws around and what force causes it to pull the planets around?Geocentrism has a lot of problems and one explanation must work for all cases to which it is applicable. In my experience geocentrists can proffer an explanation for one thing which fails to explain anything else within a geocentrist universe and causes even more problems. As far as I can tell this is why they dont use a unified mathematical model like the other accepted models. If they did theyd have plenty of credibility within scientific circles.,askscience,d1i2bqo,0,t5_2qm4e7074194,0,t3_4chkmy,Thank you for your submission!

A darkened solar cell will allow almost no current to flow in the negative direction at least until its break down voltage and will also allow almost no current flow in the positive direction either at least until a voltage approaching Voc is applied this is the turnon voltage of the diode. However their is some small current flow what would be called leakage current in the diode world and so it is prudent to use a second blocking diode with a much smaller leakage current to prevent this. Take a look at the dark and light IV curves here Also please note that industrial solar cells are often fairly poor quality diodes so the leakage current can be significant as you can see here So it shows a diode shape but with significant flow even when the diode is off.  In my work as a PV researcher I spend more time with IIIV devices with much better curves so sometimes I forget how bad it is for industrial Si cellsIf you still dont believe me see many other posters in this thread or on this page of PV education where it says A solar cell in the dark is a large flat diode.  or google solar cell equivalent circuit. Also please consider that the solar cell is really just a Light Emitting Diode being used backwards. Seriously LEDs can be used to sense light.,askscience,d1ojqy6,7,t5_2qm4e7129549,0,t1_d1ocipy,Thank you.

From what Ive observed its not intrinsically that hard. What makes it difficult is the speed. Once you take the donated tissue off ice and start to hook up the vessels the tissue is not perfused with blood until you finish connecting the vessels. This means the organ starts to really get starved of oxygen. The longer you take the greater chance it will not function properly. You want to hook it up as fast as possible to limit its time spent off ice without good blood flow.

Another equivalent way of looking at it is that in the tennis ball case you and the person in the car disagree on the energy momentum and speed of the tennis ball which are all covariant. If they shine a flashlight you disagree on the energymomentum of the light covariant but not the speed invariant. No laws are broken because its energy and momentum which must be conserved and thus be covariant if the energy and momentum arent functions of speed which they arent for light the speed is free to be an invariant.The consequence of this reasoning is that distance and time are covariant which is weird but fine.edit Also not  faster you have to use the Lorentz factor but generally yes.,askscience,d1rpwp4,2,t5_2qm4e7157715,0,t1_d1rhv95,The attacker could just use a browser that doesnt enforce same origin policy.

Its also a staple of most engineering programs. Not really the key aspect of control theory isnt finding the solution to a specific set of equations its studying how these solutions change if the parameters of the system changes and often system properties depend more on things like is the solution positive or negative is it imaginary or real etc rather than the exact value. This is the cool part though without having a more than a coarse estimate for the actual dynamic parameters you can still say that as long as the parameters do not cross specific values the system is still controllable for example. Another cool thing is that if a controller is designed for a controllable system it will work even if the values arent exact as long as they are within the ranges you know beforehand. Once you learn to ride a bike you can ride other bikes too. Controlsystems theory is old Watt isnt famous for inventing the steam machine  he didnt  he is famous for applying controlsystems theory to create a regulator for a steam engine which was stable under a much wider range of parameters. So its possible that atleast some bike models where designed intentionally according to such principles. On the other hand experimentation will slowly show which designs have desirable properties and this cam be faster for simple systems such as bikes compared to theoretical permutation and modeling.

Certainly a quick glance does seem to imply coding. But if you look at the scientific article it is pretty clear that it considers physical size first and foremost from the abstractgtUsing DNA to archive data is an attractive possibility because it is extremely dense with a raw limit of  exabytemm  GBmm  and longlasting with observed halflife of over  years.Also this happens to be a reason I dislike reading articles. edit The paper does happen to be about error correction and how they store the data. It looks like DNA is exceptionally error prone and they have to do some work to remove these errors in a quick method given how they can read the information. I really do not see why they just do not use capacity achieving codes I also could have linked turbo codes . Or burst error correction codes. But to figure that out I would have to read the paper. So their work is basically we have to add redundancy to make this method work so DNA does not allow for more efficient information storage but the size trade off means that even with the redundant information it is still more dense. ,askscience,d1uu7ns,3,t5_2qm4e7189133,0,t3_4dy23v,Hi virjog thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Theres very few cases if any that couldnt also be explained by genetic causes. Thats not to say epigenetic inheritance isnt real in animals but Id argue that the studies as of now dont rule out other explanations. At the very least these epigenetic changes could be transient and fade after a few generations. Can you find me an animal study on epigenetic inheritance that goes past F? I have looked and I dont think such a study exists. Considering that third generation egg cells are already developing inside a second generation baby exposure from the first generation the grandmother could explain a lot of this. Thats not inheritance as much as superearly exposure. And I dont agree that the field isnt about natural selection. If epigenetic inheritance cant stick in a population beyond a few transient generations then its just environmental exposure. If it can then its a form of inheritance and is subject to and can influence selection.

In order for either ion to pass through the channel the water molecules forming the hydration shell must be stripped from the ion which requires some energy.  The inside walls of the channel are lined with the double bonded oxygen from the carboxyl group of the peptide backbone which has a partial negative charge.  The ion channel has a diameter that closely matches the K ions diameter so the conformation which includes a K ion inside the channel is energetically stable.  This means the energy released when a K ion enters the channel because free floating K without a hydration shell is a high energy state is about the same as the energy it took to strip the hydration shell making the K ions entrance into the channel energetically favorable.Conversely a Na ion is too small for the channel so the conformation consisting of a Na ion being in the channel is not very energetically stable.  Not much energy is gained by a Na ion entering the channel so it is not energetically favorable for Na ions to go into the channel.,askscience,d23vxdb,2,t5_2qm4e7267682,0,t3_4exh9b,Thank you for your submission!

This is related to another conserved quantity called the RungeLenz vector This generates another symmetry which rotates the different  states into each other provided they have the same value of n. This extra symmetry makes the r potential very special and is part of what allows it to have an exact solution. Theres a way you can combine these symmetries with rotations and show that the total symmetry group is equivalent to rotations in an abstract D space. As an aside the harmonic oscillator potential V  r also has a lot of extra symmetries in addition to rotations and its spectrum also has a highly degenerate structure.When you add in the firstorder fine structure effects to Hydrogen you still end up with a lot of symmetry causing extra degeneracies though it isnt as large of a symmetry group anymore.

Thanks for having me and for your insightful questions.To circumvent the BBB problem in local drug delivery recent approaches have focused on bypassing it. A common method is the use of Gliadel wafers a polymer implant impregnated with the agent BCNU and placed intraoperatively in the resection cavity to evade the BBB. This approach resulted in a statistically significant but modest survival advantage in both newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM. The modest benefit of Gliadel could be due to the short duration of drug delivery  most BCNU is released over a period of  days. However the fact that direct delivery of a cytotoxic drug into the resection cavity for as little as  days could improve survival of GBM patients to a degree approaching that achieved by  months of systemic chemotherapy is remarkable in itself supporting the theory that the BBB is critical to cytotoxic chemotherapy effect. Unfortunately Gliadel is not widely utilized as it requires a major surgery and can impair wound healing. Another approach of bypassing the BBB is the convection enhanced delivery system in which a catheter is surgically inserted into the tumor to deliver chemotherapy. This invasive procedure requires prolonged hospitalization meticulous maintenance of the external catheter to prevent serious complications and as a result remains investigational and is rarely used.About immunotherapy in brain tumors it is still unclear whether certain immunotherapy drugs need to get into the brain to be effective.  As you pointed that a PD inhibitor may not need to enter the brain to work as it may work in the periphery.  However in the case laser ablation and what happens afterward a potentially perfect environment is created for an in situ vaccine.   Here the entire tumor which has been killed by heat remains in situ. The ensuing peritumoral bloodbrain barrier disruption may allow for the release of inactivated tumor proteins with unique and potentially highly immunogenic mutations neoantigens into the blood stream so that they may be picked up by immune cells to generate an effective antitumor immune reaction. At the same time the disrupted peritumoral bloodbrain barrier may also allow these newly generated antitumor immune cells to get access to the peritumoral region where they can seek out and potentially eliminate tumor cells. This potential phenomenon presents an attractive rationale combining this technology with other immunotherapy to further augment the immune reactions generated by both approaches. This is an area that will be examined very carefully going forward and has excellent potential to result in improved survival.  In terms of antibodies gaining access to the brain Im not aware of any definitive data that demonstrates easy access of antibodies to the brain with an intact BBB.  In fact even with a disrupted BBB it may still be difficult for antibodies to access the brain due to the high pressure within the brain.  We have not demonstrated definitively that antibodies did gain access to the peritumoral region in our report but are working on that.  In animal models of LITT antibodies clearly got in easily.,askscience,d2ahlj0,30,t5_2qm4e7322339,0,t1_d2a8eax,Josh Thanks everybody for your questions and comments. Some of the responses below are very good. Temozolomide is our current standard of care but does not work for everyone and prognosis for GBM remains very poor. The hope is that by opening the BBB at least temporarily we can deliver other agents that may be promising. Another important point is that GBMs and other glial tumors spread locally so even after resection or ablation we know that there are tumor cells hiding beyond the margin of the resection. The BBB breakdown by the laser ablation is well focused to exactly this area and the hope is that the delivery of the agent will be locally directed and thus have fewer side effects and have increased efficacy. ,askscience,d2ahzzv,15,t5_2qm4e7323202,0,t1_d2adckp,Yes there were different speciation dynamics at work depending on the different group of dinosaur.

Conversely ceratopsids and hadrosauriforms did not show any signs of slowdowns or declines.It is not clear whether these differences were due to inherent factors but ceratopsids and hadrosauriforms had unique independently acquired jaw functional morphological adaptations that allowed them to process food very efficiently and perhaps this key innovation allowed them to speciate quickly.,askscience,d2alj44,2,t5_2qm4e7324090,0,t1_d2aodhg,removed,askscience,d2ap5yu,1,t5_2qm4e7324914,0,t3_4fpb3x,Thank you for your submission!

If you zoom in on those absorption peaks you will see they have a finite width to them. For atoms moving in a dilute gas the width is determined the natural linewidth this is related to the uncertainty principle and some extra Doppler broadening from the motion of the atoms. The Doppler broadening comes from the fact that moving atoms see a red or blue shifted photon so depending on their relative motion to the light source each atom absorbs at a slightly different peak wavelength. When you average over many atoms you get get a smooth function that is broader than the natural linewidth.If you tune a laser so that its wavelength is slightly longer than the peak of an absorption line only the atoms moving towards the light source will absorb the photons because those atoms see the photons as slightly blue shifted. After absorbing a photon the atom then emits a photon in a random direction. On average this means the photon pushes the atom away from the light source. Since we selected for the atoms that were moving towards the light source with the wavelength that means the atom loses some kinetic energy on average if the photon momentum is smaller than the atoms momentum.In a laser cooling setup you ensure there are beams coming at the sample from every direction. That way no matter which direction the atom is moving there is a laser beam pointing at it and it can only absorb photons from that laser. The net effect is to create optical molasses so that fast atoms are slowed down.I think that covers  and  on your list. As for the other questions Doppler cooling alone can only cool you to the Doppler temperature. Basically once the Doppler broadening is smaller than the natural linewidth your laser will scatter off every atom equally so you cant select for the fast moving atoms anymore. There is also a recoil temperature below which the recoil from the photon will actually reverse the direction of the atom rather than just slowing it down. To get colder than these limits you need other techniques e.g. evaporative cooling. Doppler cooling is a big piece of forming a BoseEinstein condensate. It can also be used to reduce Doppler broadening for more accurate atomic clocks. You dont need too much quantum to understand Doppler cooling. If you understand why atoms have absorption spectra you are almost there. The electrons in an atom are only allowed to exist at specific energy levels so atoms only absorb photons that move the electron between two allowed levels. If you want to understand why there is a natural linewidth associated with this process this is a good resource.,askscience,d2glfqy,3,t5_2qm4e7378810,0,t3_4g0s9l,Its not that it sounds better but rather it tends to be preferred by most people. You seem to be saying you prefer music with more dynamic range no?Its because the majority of people like simpler more forward obvious things.You have the same problem with TV and monitors. Most computer monitors and TVs are waaaay too blue from the factory. But blue looks brighter in the showroom and people tend to prefer the brighter looking TV. A properly color calibrated screen has a wider color gamut skin tones look way better but the whole screen will appear dimmer and slightly pink next to the cold blue factory calibrations.

Obviously light isnt conserved so it doesnt satisfy requirement .  And in general a process can be considered photocatalytic even if it doesnt lower the activation energy e.g. a semiconductor may capture a photon and transfer either the electron of hole to a photoinactive adsorbate so it doesnt always satisfy  either.In fact theres a few people in the field who get annoyed by the term photocatalysis and make a point of correcting the misuse of the term.  But the fact of the matter is that photocatalysis is a broadlyaccepted term.

Over the past couple decades there have been major discoveries made in genomics in terms of procaryotes one of the major issues is gene swapping making it impossible to create pure monophyletic clades this even happens in complex life forms for instance placental mammals have placentas which are built using viral protiens that were introduced to an ancient organism through infection so placentals in some sense are partialy descendants of ancient  viruses.  The effect is simply more extreme in many procaryote groups.Ultimately the answer to your question has to do with history.  In the late th and th centuries researchers were busy discovering identifying and organizing bacteria and they followed Lineaus model to do so.  Its important to note here these microbiologists were not being dumb they simply didnt have all the information we have now they did the best they could with what they had.  Now though we we are stuck in a situation where procaryote classification is archaic and messy and arguably more importantly there is no clearcut way to fix it because the decent and ancestory of procaryotes is messy not to mention trying to impose a classification system built for sexually reproducing eukaryotes runs into all sorts of problems when applied to asexual procaryotes that swap genes all willy nilly.So tldr  you are correct that the concept of species doesnt work very well for bacteria but we use it because of historical precedent and its still really the only system we have.,askscience,d2r9jd1,4,t5_2qm4e7470541,0,t3_4hn7ss,removed,askscience,d2rcsro,1,t5_2qm4e7470829,0,t1_d2rd4sc,I agree.

Any time you store energy you must convert it between different states of energy electrical chemical heat light ect and by doing these conversions you will lose energy because not  of the energy is converted to the type you want.  With lithium ion betteries the loss isnt too high.  kwh Roadster battery takes kwh to charge   Hydroelectric plants are very efficient at converting mechanical power to electric power up to  according to   But you also lose energy when you lift the water up for storage which would probably be more than  loss. So the total energy loss from a water gravity battery would be higher than the  loss from charging the lithium ion battery.Another reason is cost and space. Batteries are small and price is relatively low. The cost of the high precision turbines needed to get that  efficiency are very expensive. Lifting water to a great height means you need to have a tall storage tank probably outdoors as well where batteries can be put in a much smaller space and can be made to any size needed. The Roadster battery has a capacity of kwh  megajoules to get the same amount of storage from a water tower  meters tall it would need to hold a lot of water.gtx kg  . ms   m   MJ  Where x is the amount of water . is the acceleration due to gravity  m is the height of the tower and  MJ is the potential energy.If I did my math right that means you would need a water tower that can hold about  metric tons.

Especially because the effects of dark energy would basically just make the target destination farther than you expect so you would really just need to travel for a bit longer rather than change course.gtOh and it says friedman calculated a negative spatial curvature in  meaning the universe should expand forever not ever collapse. Way before the discovery of dark energy.Thats not what it says it says that he derived the equations describing a negatively curved universe in  not that he demonstrated that our universe possesses such a property. As far as we can tell our universe is actually flat. In such a universe youre right that the universe wouldnt ever collapse on itself but rather it would continue expanding forever but at an asymptotically decreasing rate even in the absence of dark energy. So the correct statement is that if our universe were flat and there were no dark energy then the expansion of the universe would be slowing down. But since it appears to be flat but there is dark energy it is instead accelerating due to the negative pressure of dark energy!,askscience,d2voj2q,2,t5_2qm4e7511921,0,t1_d2w2diz,removed,askscience,d2w2gk0,1,t5_2qm4e7513433,0,t1_d2w86bk,removed,askscience,d2w8n7k,1,t5_2qm4e7514246,0,t3_4ia0op,removed,askscience,d2wbz41,1,t5_2qm4e7516034,0,t3_4iavua,Hi fllr thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

That means if we take the lowest temperatures currently recorded  C and take the lowest variance noted  C the lowest temperatures in an ice age we might expect would be around  C. Granted there is likely some variation so the real value might be higher or lower but that gets us in the ballpark. Given that dry ice sublimates at . C at atmospheric pressure that should be more than enough to get us dry ice formation given the proper conditions. In fact we could even get dry ice formation in the present day at the coldest temperatures found like  C!Sadly though no dry ice has been found in Antarctica and even if you went back to the ice age you wouldnt find any. Why is that? The answer is the partial pressure of CO is too low meaning that there arent enough CO particles in the air to freeze and accumulate as they will sublimate much faster than they are deposited. This article does a good job of explaining it in some more detail. So while you unfortunately couldnt and cant find CO in Antarctica I hope your curiosity was satisfied.,askscience,d310td9,11,t5_2qm4e7555485,0,t3_4itor3,Thank you for your submission!

This defines a map from the evens to the odds and taking the inverse function gn  n   on the odds it defines a map from the odds to the evens.

Those functions have wacky zeros and are very useful in fluid dynamics controls and electrical engineering.Theres actually a really interesting property of the zeros of a parabola like yx.  The zeros of the function are   i.  If you assume the zeros are real so x y and x y and you know a third point  in this case you can plot the parabola.  Youll end up with a mirror of the parabola which if youre graphing it by hand based on the imaginary intercepts speeds up the graph of the parabola by a huge factor.  It works and will always work for parabolas because youre effectively rotating about the complex plane.  You can think of imaginary numbers as where the function would intercept an axis where it to actually intersect.

Freud was one of the first to link psychological problems with memory which today is all the rage known as Trauma Informed Care.Many theoretical approaches that have evolved since Freud say much of the same things in different ways or from different perspectives.  I personally see them all as different paths up the same mountain that at times may intersect or share a tributary towards the same summit.  Freuds work is definitely not given proper respect in most universitycollege programs something I have not learned myself until some  years since my first college psychology class.One thought about a more modern perspective of the unconscious that comes to mind for me although not a direct corralative would be current theories stemming from Paul Mcleans Triune Brain Theory.  This approach emphasizes the differences between the brain stem area think heartbeat endocrine system breathing the stuff that makes us biological robots the Limbic System think survival brain fightflightfreeze emotions sensory input and the Cerebral Cortex think rational brain language premise premise conclusion.Another emerging theory is call Network Theory which suggests consciousness is no singular part of the brain but a gestalt of processes similar to a network of computer servers may represent a single entity. The research suggests that consciousness is likely a product of this widespread communication and that we can only report things that we have seen once they are being represented in the brain in this manner. Thus no one part of the brain is truly the seat of the soul as Ren Descartes once wrote in a hypothesis about the pineal gland but rather consciousness appears to be an emergent property of how information that needs to be acted upon gets propagated throughout the brain. ,askscience,d3bbuj7,4,t5_2qm4e7646357,0,t3_4k1e1x,Hi endridfps thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

These come in the form of  amphipathic triglycerides with a waterloving end and waterfearing end. They like to normally align in what is called a micelle in the normal solution keeping the polar waterend near the aqueous environment and the hydrophobic waterfearing end away prewhipping.Once whipping begins you begin to rupture these precious micelles that protect the hydrophobic portion of these molecules. When this occurs these recently exposed molecules seek each other out and in certain situations they form smaller or similarly sized not significant micelles around a pocket of air. As you continue to whip more and more of these form and after enough time you get what you considered whipped cream which is essentially just these now airfilled micelles.Butter actually comes from continuing to whip further damaging these membranes that have formed around air sometimes releasing it. When enough of this air has been released and the triglycerides can reform around each other. This when done correctly leads to butter.,askscience,d3g1pho,4,t5_2qm4e7687759,0,t1_d3g1hc4,Strawberries break down really easily.

Larger stars burn hot live fast and die young. Smaller stars live longer. In your hypothetical binary system the larger star would almost certainly die off first.If the larger star were to capture a much older smaller star then it would work out.

This was once a major interpretation of quantum mechanics which Ill call local hidden variables. Unfortunately it turns out that this interpretation leads to different experimental consequences than quantum mechanics and experiments seem to show that quantum mechanics is correct. This is in contrast to Copenhagenlike interpretations which claim that it doesnt make sense to assign one or the other coin to heads or tails until they are measured. This is the usual picture of what you call quantum weirdness though as you point out entanglement cant be used to communicate. Let me go over why local hidden variables do not work using a thought experiment Im using an edited version of a previous post of mine here. the TLDR is that using very basic assumptions of probabilities you cant assign the same kinds of probabilities to a local hidden variable theory that you can assign with a quantum mechanical theory and experiments have shown that quantum mechanics is correct in these cases.The thought experiment involves a pair of electrons with entangled spins. After being created at the same point the electrons go in opposite directions towards two detectors A and B. Unless there is some way for them to communicate at a distance they cannot send any information to each other after they are separated. When A and B measure the spin of their individual electrons along any axis they always get either up or down with  probability each. However if they measure their spins along the same direction they always get opposite values from each other.Lets try to explain this using a probability theory like flipping a coin. If we could solve the classical dynamics of a flipped coin exactly we could always predict whether it is heads or tails. However we dont have this info so we assign some probability P and P of it being heads and tails respectively probability of heads  probability of tails   of course you must get some answer. After flipping the same coin many times youll be able to reconstruct the probability P. For a fair coin P  . but you could have a rigged coin where P is anything between  and .Correspondingly we assume that the two spins have some definite function telling them what their actual spin is at any angle which was determined when they were created but we cant figure it out. However we can replace the exact values with some probabilities which successive experiments will converge to. Lets assume that A and B both only measure their particles along the angles   and  with respect to the zaxis. We assume that A has some unknown probabilities for measuring spin up for her particle at these anglesPAup  XPAup  YPAup  Zwhere X Y and Z are between  and  and of course PAdown    PAup    X etc. since each probability must add to one with certainty either up or down will be measured. Finally since the distribution for particle B needs to be opposite that for A the two electron spins are perfectly anticorrelated in any given direction we havePBdown  XPBdown  YPBdown  Z.Ok so weve set up a theory and we can now try to fit experiments to this. Notice importantly that we have to specify all three angles for both particles because the angles can be changed en route between when the particles are created and detected  unless the particles know what is going on somewhere else they need to have all of the above information specified at the start.Lets ask a simple question. What is the total probability that the A and B spins have opposite spins across any two distinct angles? That is P  PA at  opposite of B at   PA at  opposite of B at   PA at  opposite of B at . This isP  XY  XY  XZ  XZ  YZ  YZ.I hope its clear how I computed this probability from the above definitions. After some simple algebraP    XYZ  XYZ  .Here the final inequality follows because X Y and Z are between  and  since they are probabilities so both terms are just positive numbers. This is called a Bell inequality and it is totally independent of what X Y and Z are. It applies for any hidden variable theory given the assumptions Ive made throughout mostly locality.Of course the punchline is the quantum calculation which agrees with experimentPquantum   lt .QED. No matter what probability distribution you give me whatever values of X Y and Z it will fail to describe quantum mechanics and experiments.How do we reconcile this? One easy way is to allow FTL communication. Maybe the particles know what the detector will measure infinitesimally before they reach it and they change their distribution then. Maybe the particles communicate with each other faster than light to make their probabilities change. The other way is not to assign probabilities to events which arent measured so you do not have any sort of probability distribution like I wrote above. Essentially each classical probability PA at  opposite of B at  assumes that there is some probabilities assigned to the  angles but in local quantum mechanics you simply dont assign values to the unmeasured angle. But this is precisely the weirdness that local hidden variables is trying to get rid of.,askscience,d3ieedn,11,t5_2qm4e7709762,0,t3_4ktcww,Hey Dr. Wright a bit late to this.

First lets get straight what the uncertainty principle actually is. There are many uncertainty principles but the one you are referencing is the classic xp   where x is uncertainty in the position p is the uncertainty in the momentum and  is Plancks constant divided by . This says very simply that the product of the uncertainty in the position and the uncertainty in the momentum must always meet or exceed this minimal value.  This is true for all particleswaves not just light. Its true for electrons and protons gluons neutrinos whatever. The thing is  is very very very small on everyday scales much less intergalactic ones. Its about x m kg  s. Just treating a baseball as a single particle to get a feel for the size of the effect go ahead and calculate the minimal positional uncertainty for a fastball with a speed known to  decimal places. Its much much less than the size of an atom. Our uncertainty in the distances of other galaxies is generally .

It has a particle size ranging from less than  micrometres to more than  millimetre but typically  to  micrometres. Depending on the granularity this powder can have an abrasive feel similar to pumice powder and has a low density as a result of its high porosity. The typical chemical composition of ovendried diatomaceous earth is  to  silica with  to  alumina attributed mostly to clay minerals and . to  iron oxide.Diatomaceous earth consists of fossilized remains of diatoms a type of hardshelled algae.

Im really interested in understanding it but I have no idea what is going on or even what is officially assumed to be going on.Is it just a bunch of magnets pointed in the same direction?  And what is being accelerated just the magnetism?  Or is a partical manually tossed into the machine to ride the magnetic field around the collider?  Or is it assumed that some particle in the air gets caught in the magnetic flow and zooms around the collider? Or is it assumed that a chain of particles forms a long train that extends throughout the length of the collider which carries the wave through the collider?  And then what is physically observed at the end? Why do we think anything traveled around the collider?   If radiation is detected at the end how do we know its not just a wave traveling down a long chain or just coming from one of the particles at the end of the collider being shoved into another one nearby by having all that magnetism focused on it?  Are there any manual steps taken that would affect the timing of the result besides just turning on the magnets?Thank you.,askscience,d3kdjno,1,t5_2qm4e7726656,0,t1_d3jx8lq,But what about before and after people?

In fact they have a whole lot of them just as a xylophone produces many sounds or a pick on a guitar string but the resonance of one particular frequency well many of them when you get into harmonics but still same sound in a sense is what allows our brains to lock into a pitch.So thats the short answer.,askscience,d3z6gnv,2,t5_2qm4e7857171,0,t1_d3v4tya,This is the conclusion I came to after a lot of thought over the weekend!

The liquid surface just gets fuzzy and disappears which is pretty cool.Ive employed the critical point to dry delicate microfabricated structures without destroying them from surface tension.

Take a bunch of objects  baseballs say  in vacuum and push them apart so theyre initially expanding away from one another. Well think of gravity as being described by good old Newtonian forces so theres no metric expansion or curvature of spacetime or any other weirdness to worry about.What happens to these baseballs after their initial push? Theyll keep expanding apart for a while at least. But because gravity is attractive their expansion will slow down. Depending on their initial speed corresponding effectively to whether they were pushed apart above or below escape velocity they might even slow down so much that they stop expanding apart altogether and then recollapse towards each other.This is what until  most cosmologists thought the Universe was going to do. In fact if you work out the equations the baseballs obey in this Newtonian gravity setup and then work out the equations that govern the expansion of a universe made of normal matter in Einsteins gravity youll find they are exactly the same equations!The trick as uParax mentioned is incorporating nonnormal matter like dark energy into this picture. You could just say this works in the absence of dark energy or cosmic strings domain walls scalar fields with funny potentials and other types of exotic matter but we can do a bit better. We just need to allow gravity to not always behave in precisely the way that Newton said it did.In particular Newtonian gravity with its r force law reproduces the right metric expansion for a universe made up only of normal matter. To incorporate dark energy you need to add a repulsive component to the gravitational force and the strength of the force has to grow the further apart things are. The simplest kind of dark energy a cosmological constant corresponds to including a force proportional to r.,askscience,d4cu2d9,2,t5_2qm4e7980130,0,t1_d4bxeev,So you seem to be the authority on all things bee related so I will ask you this if you dont mind because I need serious help.I have pretty bad entomophobia insects in general and absolutely crippling melissophobia bees also wasps too.

At low energies QM should be ok but the technical difficulties get intense. The Schrodinger equation doesnt change but the Hamiltonian becomes extremely difficult to work with. The Dirac Hamiltonian takes a different form due to needing to use something called the spin connection which gives the coupling of spin to curvature. Also most scattering equations in QFT use the fact that the states are asymptotically in flat space so the expansion of space obviously violates this and the formalism requires some corrections if the expansion is enough to affect scattering experiments. ,askscience,d4iyrff,1,t5_2qm4e8033445,0,t3_4p91in,Thank you for your submission!

You cant neither assume right off the bat that OP or anybody who reads this is not a musical aspirant just because its not specified in the question but that isnt even the main point of the subject. There are some qualities in voice that are considered to be desirable and enjoyable and those qualities define the comparison between two voices. Being those qualities biologically or can be achieved by practice or other factors is what OP is asking and the correct answer is that although natural talent exists and you can born with specific characteristics that make your voice sound good to other people is the listener in the end who determines which of those qualities makes your voice better than other and those qualities can be biological or acquired over training.

Add a quantum at time t. ltpgt is nonzero. Therefore the graph of ltptgt has a kink at t. You might object that adding a quantum at t is only an approximation to more complicated field dynamics but we know this cant invalidate the argument since we know that by conservation of energy and energy quantization there is no time at which there is half a quantum of energy. You might object with the timeenergy uncertainty relation however time is not an operator in QM the relation merely tells us the shortest time scale on which we are capable of experimentally distinguishing changes in P to more than a standard deviation. Finally you might object something to do with superposition something about perturbation theory and a sum over processes happening at slightly different times. However there is no rule in QFT that realistic interactions have to smooth out your ltptgt distribution! At the end of the day it is a multiparticle theory with creation and annihilation operators and there is nothing forbidding processes that create or annihilate particles at some time t  in fact thats kind of the whole point. Analogs of Ehrenfests theorem get pretty complicated in QFT but the intuition from QM still holds that ltdVdxgt is singular at the first moment of pair creation and therefore dltpgtdt can be as well. Ultimately the situation is not all that different from classical mechanics where working with generalized functions is totally kosher point particles to wit but we dont know whether they will be appropriate when a UVcomplete theory is ultimately found. ,askscience,d4tb1o8,1,t5_2qm4e8124974,0,t1_d4sk2na,Fun thing to imagine If youd drill a hole all the way through the core and to the other side and then jump in on one side ignoring air resistance of course youd just fly back and forth between the two entrances.,askscience,d4tbj69,5,t5_2qm4e8126254,0,t3_4qjcom,Hi birkinrug thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

As such the tea with no milk should cool off quicker then adding milk should make it drop even more as opposed to make it drop by adding milk then waiting.Of course you can consider some scenarios in which this isnt true for example when the milk is actually hotter than the tea when the temperature of the room is much lower than the milk etc... but in common scenarios it should work as explained.,askscience,d54915y,1,t5_2qm4e8213580,0,t1_d543zh0,removed,askscience,d5492xw,2,t5_2qm4e8213978,0,t1_d547kc3,removed,askscience,d54avgl,1,t5_2qm4e8215508,0,t1_d54f00b,removed,askscience,d54hrrj,0,t5_2qm4e8221505,0,t1_d54x49z,So what if you included time?Im trying to picture how youd even begin to calculate the timevolume of a simple hypercube.

The only way it could actually hurt you would be if you got really unlucky and it hit a cell in just the right state in just the right part of the DNA to cause the cell to become cancerous.

People like to use virtual particles to describe this to laymen which I dont like because virtual particles are more particular to a method of calculation than what is really going on.gt I have read that the Highs Higgs field is everywhere in the universe even in the vacuumThis is related to a special property of our universe. It turns out that the Standard Model has a symmetry which the ground state of our universe does not have. To explain a simpler version of this one usually compares this to magnetism the interactions which describe magnetism are all rotationally invariant but the lowestenergy configuration of a magnet is for all the magnetic moments in the magnet to point in a single direction. By picking out a special direction one says that rotation symmetry is spontaneously broken. So to steal an analogy due to Sidney Coleman if youre a tiny person living inside the magnet it would appear that the direction the magnetic moments is special and there is no rotation symmetry. But actually the fundamental laws of physics are completely rotationally symmetric this just isnt satisfied by the lowest energy state. It turns out that there is a more complicated symmetry in the Standard Model which is spontaneously broken in our universe by the lowestenergy configuration of the Higgs field. ,askscience,d5gns5z,6,t5_2qm4e8313282,0,t1_d5goqr9,removed,askscience,d5gptdy,0,t5_2qm4e8313670,0,t1_d5gqrsm,removed,askscience,d5grk4s,1,t5_2qm4e8314516,0,t1_d5gtqws,Really?

If you replaced the bone marrow of someone with type A blood with the marrow of someone who was type AB for example there is almost no risk of the newly generated white cells attacking the current red cells. Your body is more complicated than this in real life and there will be other related problems other antigens outside of ABO existing plasma antibodies etc. but your basic idea is correct.This blood type switching is seen all the time in bone marrow transplants BMTs. Your red and white cells all come from specialized cells called hematopoietic stem cells HSCs but the primary consideration in a transplant is how the white cells will react since they are more immunologically active in the body and will be responsible for any major catastrophic autoimmune events. This is controlled through human leukocyte antigen HLA matching when looking at BMTs.ABO matching is a secondary consideration and mismatches do place the patient at higher risks of harmful events such as uncontrolled destruction of the red cells but these risks disappear within a few months as new compatible red cells are generated by the bone marrow.,askscience,d5iw3r2,12,t5_2qm4e8333585,1,t3_4toqcl,You know we have a search function right?

We apply the same in some robotics applications  I dont work in robotics myself but some colleagues that do say this strategy is pretty effective in controlling movement of say a robotic manipulator.

Where are those galaxies now?Simply calculate the light years. If its  light years away thats where it was  years ago so  in the future can be predicted based on its movement if we can figure out the direction that its moving.gtIf warp drive FTL etc were a reality and we could quickly get to other galaxies how would we know where they are if were seeing where they were?You would have to calculate roughly where it would be based on the answer to question . If you could somehow travel  light years in an instant you will have actually gone back in time  years too. So youve built a time machine using its speed which breaks the laws of physics. This then leads to implications where things start to not make sense anymore. What happens if you now warp back to Earth instantly? You will be stuck  years in the Earths past. So now the question is how do you move time forward faster?

It has effect of sealing the collagen in the bone and protecting it from contamination. Archaeologists prefer to collect charred bones e.g. from a cooking fire for radiocarbon dating for that the very reason. If the fire is very hot like in a cremation the collagen might be completely burned away. Thats not ideal but its still possible to date carbonate produced by the bone burning.Its important to remember that radiocarbon dating literally dates carbon. Interpreting the result correctly comes down to where the carbon came from. If I understand you correctly youre saying the bone was burnt recently. In that case if the lab managed to recover collagen then the date should be an accurate indication of when the individual died. If the collagen was gone and they dated carbonate again it should be a reliable date but carbonate is a bit more susceptible to contamination. The contamination would be in the form of carbon from the fuel of the firein this case modern cropsand so would have the effect of skewing the date to be more recent. Contamination does happen and with just one sample theres no way of telling if it did. Standard practise in archaeology is to obtain multiple dates and crosscheck them against each other and against any available contextual information on age. That may not have been possible here though.tldr Burning actually makes radiocarbon dating more reliable not less. The date is most likely to be accurate but theres a slight possibility that contamination could have made the sample appear to be more recent than it really is.,askscience,d5zjdrw,1,t5_2qm4e8464676,0,t3_4vcqfx,Anemia is primarily going to lead you down the path of looking at MCV values to see what is causing the patients anemia.MCV is going to be the average size of your RBCs...whether they are large or small. Here is a nice diagram to show you the typical flow chart that you can follow when seeing the MCV values Flow ChartSo if the cell is small low MCV it can be caused by an ironhemoglobin issue...but if it is a large cell high MCV you can think B deficiency which doesnt allow the reticulocyte a baby RBC to properly form into an RBC adult version that is smaller in size. If MCV is normal that means that you are either not producing enough RBC losing blood bleeding out kidney issue etc.This is how I think of it. You need iron to make hemoglobin Hg. If you dont have iron you wont have enough Hg in the RBC making it smaller. Also if you have an issue that improperly makes your Hg ThalassemiaSideroblastic Anemia youll have a smaller RBC for the same reason. Nice way to understand the difference between those  is that Thalassemia is able to use the right amount of iron so your serum iron will be normal. However Sideroblastic is unable to use the correct amount of iron and thus youll have high amounts of iron in the blood decreasing your TIBC.Hopefully that helps.,askscience,d5zmdqs,3,t5_2qm4e8465669,0,t1_d5zohv8,giant laser destroying us seems more convincing than itll get C warmer unfortunately,askscience,d5zqvbx,1,t5_2qm4e8466568,0,t1_d5zetts,gt  its entirely possible that tomorrow an intergalactic janitor comes to replace the suns light bulb with a pink disco ball.Since its technically possible and granted that we live in a single universe existing alongside an infinite number of other universes ie multiverse for the sake of this question only I am well aware that there is no concrete answer either way would it be correct to say that in some universe this has already happened?,askscience,d5zuxqi,-1,t5_2qm4e8466590,0,t3_4vnq93,Hi rangatayng thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

But it would generally break down to what youre trying to look at. For example in my lab we look at several types of data when doing an experiment. Sometimes it would just be what we consider behavioral data such as answering questions that come up on a computer screen. That would be in the realm of cognitive psych.  When you venture into cognitive neuro you start looking at the physiological data. So you could have the participant do the same task as before such as memorizing words or answering questions but at the same time you run an EEG on them gathering the electrophysiological data to overlay onto the behavioral data. This along with other methods like fMRI and things of that nature are more in the realm of cognitive neuro.

We do have animal models of mental disorders however our current conceptions of mental disorders are uniquely human constructions.  It is a bit of a leap anthropomorphizing animals to have mental disorders   applying constructs created to describe human experiences to animals.  Our mental disorders really are constructs  not things that physically exist but rather a useful concept made to describe explain or predict something that does physically exist in this case human behaviour thought and feeling.  These constructs have and will continue to change over time to better reflect more useful conceptualizations of mental disorders.  Since in my opinion the value of a construct is based on how useful it is it doesnt automatically follow that a construct that is useful to describe human behaviour or thought will be useful to describe the behaviour and thoughts of other animals and I dont think its entirely appropriate to do so.While we have biological correlates of most if not all mental disorders and our basic assumption is that these disorders are due to some brain differences our current conceptions and diagnoses are mostly behavioural  we cant give a brain scan and be informed about depression or ADHD for example.  That being said I dont know too much about animal behaviour or animal models of human psychopathology  they do exist and are useful for studying human psychopathology.  We have mice that act similar to depressed humans and other disorders.  I do imagine it depends on the specific disorder  Id be pleasantly surprised if I discovered there were animal models of personality disorders for example but it doesnt surprise me that we have animal models of depression for example.So I guess my answer is animals may suffer from mental disorders but it may not be fully appropriate to apply human constructs to animal psychopathology.  The concept of human psychopathology may not be fully applicable to animal behaviour.,askscience,d6isvnr,2,t5_2qm4e8619106,0,t1_d6iwkv8,removed,askscience,d6izkzd,0,t5_2qm4e8619262,0,t1_d6iwadf,removed,askscience,d6j0adu,1,t5_2qm4e8621514,0,t1_d6jaags,removed,askscience,d6jagr9,1,t5_2qm4e8622166,0,t1_d6isubt,removed,askscience,d6jdepu,1,t5_2qm4e8626194,0,t3_4y0e3p,Hi AADARSHSINGH thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

The way flash memory works is very cool. Basically you use electrical energy at a point in time to charge or lose the charge on a specific gate which corresponds to a  or . When power is turned off that charge or lack of charge stays. Another analogy is that imagine you have land and a nearby islands with water separating them. You as a person are on land and represent a charge and cant get across the other side to the island. Every now and then with some power applied you can get the water to freeze into a walkway that you can run across and when the freezing power goes away you are left on that island.

Interestingly perhaps the greatest influence we see in psychology today aside from Freud is another famed psychoanalyst. Someone who many lay people have never heard of John Bowlby Bowlbys work on Attachment Theory has spawned more research than virtually any other theory in psychology. Google Scholar search since  results forpsychoanalytic OR psychoanalysis  KCBT OR Cognitive Behavior therapy  K umbrella term of many theoriestherapiesAttachment Theory  K k all timeDespite the narrative of CBT dominating psychoanalytic thinking continues to have a very strong influence on research today AS WELL AS cognitive and behavioral theories. Attachment theory is the underlying basis for  of what is taught in psychotherapy training programs today. Relationships are CRITICAL to helping people get better. No amount of skill teaching will help someones mental health without a skilled clinician to whom this person can relate. It is these experiences that have a dramatic impact on therapys effectiveness see Norcross and Wampold   And as it turns out CBTs are perhaps not all that we once thought they were. While they benefited greatly in the beginning of these orientation wars because of the ability to publish quickly they have suffered over the longterm as more heterogeneous groups are studied. And the exact components that lead to better outcomes have also been called into question Personally I feel that the field is actually starting to come together and there are unifying forces at play. Psychodynamic and relational models have finally gotten their act together and started studying brief models testing manualized treatments codifying and evaluating methodologies and interventions. In addition mindfulness and buddhist psychology inspired treatments are all the rage. Mindfulness fits very well into CBT models but also into psychoanalytic models. I believe that we are going to see a great joining of forces in the near future as all camps begin to integrate all that the broad field of psychology has to offerand mindfulnessbuddhist psychology is very likely to be the glue. ,askscience,d6qdmd1,1,t5_2qm4e8678446,0,t3_4yu1s4,removed,askscience,d6qfgy6,1,t5_2qm4e8678584,0,t3_4ycf5l,On a side note at depths over  feet in complete darkness we have recently discovered bacteria that eats rock to live.

Define connected.Just because gas molecules arent connected in the sense of a crystal lattice in some kind of solid or some other intermolecular bond doesnt mean that they dont interact. There is the concept of the mean free path which is a measure of the average distance a particle travels before it collides with another particle. Now air molecules dont really collide like an instantaneous collision they interact through the electromagnetic force electrons repelling each other over a nonzero distance so this collision is more of a threshold value.You can think of this as a collection of billiard balls flying around if there are more billiard balls in a given volume the mean free path will be lower  i.e. higher density. And if the billiard balls are movingvibrating faster higher temperature the mean free path will again be lower.From this mean free path you can actually work out the speed of sound  the bulk averaged motion of a disturbance propagating through a fluid in this way.,askscience,d6ryme1,4,t5_2qm4e8691113,0,t1_d6rz7to,removed,askscience,d6s0n77,1,t5_2qm4e8696667,0,t3_4z3zr2,removed,askscience,d6spq8u,1,t5_2qm4e8697505,0,t1_d6sn9j1,gt Birkhoffs theorem tells us that any spherically symmetric metric for a vacuum must be both static and asymptotically flat.Isnt that true only with out a cosmological constant?

The same is true of basketball soccer etc. In most strategy games that same error component is ramped up by making it computationally complex.Any game approaches zero chance when played by an expert and a novice. The chance of a game of chess  therefore depends less on the properties of chess itself and more on the skill difference of the players. ,askscience,d6ya1g9,1,t5_2qm4e8741532,0,t1_d6yb8c4,Youre on the right track but the concept of chance can be easily defined. It is simply variation among outcomes. If thats surprising compare it to certainty. Chance is simply the absence of certainty.gt Presumably the winrate of matches between the highest MMR gapped players would be mostly indicative of how much chance is fundamental to the game.See my other post for details but actually the highest gapped players have the lowest element of chance in outcomes.

A little harder to visualize so bare with me and let me know if I lose you at any point. When you have a large number of objects moving around and pulling each other the sum of the angular momentum has to point in one direction. I dont know if you did this experiment in high school but if you take fabric and weight down the center then dump a bunch of marbles into this stretched fabric from multiple directions youre left with marbles all going in the same direction at one point or another. This happens on a galactic scale where things moving every which way slams into each other and cancels each other out leaving the planets and stars that didnt collide into each other all going in the same direction seemingly on the same plane.,askscience,d73cm7q,4,t5_2qm4e8782114,0,t1_d72zdj3,Here is a neat demonstration of the latter effect which is called the Magnus Effect.

Really depends on the explosion. Blast overpressure is the main concern when youre very close but thats a factor of the net explosive weight and the relative equivalent factor to TNT. Some explosives are more brisant than others and will create different overpressure characteristics for the same weight as others. Comparatively you can be very close to Hollywood style pyrotechnics but much farther for something like C. However once you start getting out of blast overpressure range the next thing that will kill you is fragmentation. Our calculations for fragmentation are based on how heavy we judge the metal casing on the bomb to be. Ie a bomb vs an artillery round vs a hand grenade. Imagine  pounds of TNT all alone on the flat ground where you wont have to worry about fragmentation. Theres various levels of how injured you can expect to be within certain blast overpressure values but you can very safely expect to be completely okay at  ft away from that  lbs if you cover your ears. However if that  lbs of TNT is inside of an artillery round you have a  chance of being hit by a potentially lethal piece of fragmentation  feet away. We also have something called rogue fragmentation which tend to be parts of bomb casings that are much thicker than others and like to stay together in one big heavy piece. Things like lifting lugs strongbacks and baseplates. Rogue frag is known to reach as far as  feet and has even killed EOD techs not too long ago. TLDRDepends on the bomb. Could be a couple feet could be thousands. ,askscience,d74syz0,3,t5_2qm4e8793853,0,t3_50l0en,Thank you for your submission!

Transforming coordinate systems makes certain geometric problems comically easy to solve and can make representation of certain behaviors much more clear. Computers dont really care how easy a problem is to solve.  They dont care what the solution or work involved to get there looks like.  They simply do the adds and then report the result.  I think the only reason youd use a nonlinear coordinate system in a computational environment was if there was a human consumer of the data involved ie actually interpreting data not just looking at display output.  As for floats  Im not sure what youre getting at here.  In a nonlinear system eg spherical coordinates some values might be integer v. decimal in a linear system but one of the advantages of a computer in data analysis is that you get as much precision as you want.  I guess if you were extremely performance dependent an integeronly situation would be preferable to a situation with a lot of floats but when youre dealing with a simulation of the real world I think most problems are going to involve a lot of floats regardless and the performance speedup probably is not as dramatic as you might expect floats might be a few times slower but not orders of magnitude slower.  ,askscience,d793n73,3,t5_2qm4e8830137,0,t1_d78wuvj,To elaborate on this not all objects in motion observe kinetic friction.

The universe expansion is accelerating but not the strength of the force that put galaxy away from each other. Take the electromagnetism vs nuclear strong interaction. You can levitate with electromagnetism some atoms in the air. But you cant have two electromagnetic field strong enough to split an atom in two. The strong interection is  times stronger than electromagnetism at the rang of an atom. But pass this distance the electromagnetic force become stronger.Same with electromagnitsm vs gravity. On the surface you can levitate stuff with electromanetism making a force stronger than gravity can. But after a couple of meter you cant do it anymore the strenght of the force drop with distance and will eventually be weaker than gravity.It seem to be the same with gravtity vs the accelerating forces. The best hypothesis right now for that force seem to be the cosmological constant. Basically it would be a fundamental characteristic of spacetime. Meaning that the density of repulsive force never drop and stay the same. But we know that gravity effect decrease with distance. The earth pull us stronger than the sun can but the sun create more gravity. At a some distance the gravity become weaker than the constant and thats where we see an expansion but inside gravitational system like galaxy or super cluster the constant dont really affect it.,askscience,d7bm6tk,1,t5_2qm4e8850734,0,t3_51d0nh,Thank you for your submission!

I get that this is the most likely answer.  However we cant detect heat from it.  We cant detect any form of radiation from it.  To the best of my knowledge the only reason we think anything is there is the gravitational lensing we can see around it.  And its convenient to shoehorn DM into our observation that a large amount of mass seems to be missing from the observable universe.  To me this seems to imply that possibly we are missing something from our understanding of how gravity works rather than there is some form of almost totally invisible matter out there.,askscience,d7e98p2,-1,t5_2qm4e8871737,0,t1_d7e98p2,removed,askscience,d7e9aeq,1,t5_2qm4e8872783,0,t3_51s1m4,No the atmospheric density would simply decay exponentially with altitude.In fact this assumption is already made in deriving the barometric formula because over the length scales were interested it gravity is approximately constant anyway.,askscience,d7edtdg,16,t5_2qm4e8873957,0,t1_d7e99io,deleted,askscience,d7eiw71,0,t5_2qm4e8876556,0,t3_51t6ri,Thats the hard disk light. It flashes when the disk is in use. It doesnt really have much to do with thinking as you can imagine  you can have intense disk activity and little processing or a lot of processing and pretty much zero disk activity. But its usually a good sign that things are going to get slow if it stays lit as the hard disk is a dreadfully slow component. SSDs have fortunately improved matters by a lot.By the way the once per bit thing did happen with old network hardware. There were hubs with  sent on the network line  LED is on logic. This actually made it possible to spy on network traffic by watching the light if you pointed the right hardware at it. And such an approach doesnt make it stay lit as LEDs can be toggled really fast. A LED being toggled on and off thousands of times per second just looks dimmer than at full power depending on the ratio of on and off times.

Here are three different grants for different labs currently working on this. Its not at all close to my area of research so someone else could comment more in depth but I took a quick look into a paper published by the first group. They genotyped a bunch of people from Tibet and found differences between high and lowaltitude populations including a clear statistical signal for SNPs in two specific genes EGLN and EPAS. So to add to the above comment there is certainly more to it than just changes in blood biochemistry but the new stuff is just starting to be worked out.Also they seem to plan to take this further specifically looking to work out the history of how these genetic differences came to be We will sequence the genome of  Sherpa and  Dai and will use these data to model the demographic history of Tibetans and of the ancestral populations contributing to their gene pool. from the first groups grant linkEdit whitespace formatting,askscience,d7fqpvi,0,t5_2qm4e8884371,0,t1_d7fpnkw,Thank you for answering!

So from an engineering perspective a stress tensor takes the normal vector of a plane through a point and gives you the resultant force on that plane. Because there may be shear involved the force vector may not be parallel to the normal vector so it is not a simple scaling but can involve rotations. Even though a tensor can be represented as matrix it is important to recognize that it is not actually a matrix just as a vector is not just a column of numbers. A vector is an object with a magnitude and direction and the representation as a column of numbers can change with changing coordinate basis but the vector itself is the same. A tensor is the same but now there are two directions and a magnitude.There are also higher order tensors. A third rank tensor linearly transforms a second rank tensor which is what is described above. Tensors are commonly used in fields like continuum mechanics and general relativity. I dont know how they would be applied to computer graphics in a way that simple rotation matrices would not but maybe there are ways.,askscience,d7glk4c,2,t5_2qm4e8891761,0,t3_521r0f,removed,askscience,d7gnwbg,1,t5_2qm4e8891782,0,t1_d7g6vvw,Thats what happens when you switch to metric.

Infinities are different applies to the cardinality of sets not the convergence of a series  a series will always either diverge or converge to a real number so infinity is not even in its codomain.So a series does not converge to a countable or uncountable infinity it only diverges in a way that its always growing.,askscience,d7n9t8p,1,t5_2qm4e8949252,0,t3_52v5zv,removed,askscience,d7nkfo0,1,t5_2qm4e8949475,0,t1_d7nk634,removed,askscience,d7nle8y,1,t5_2qm4e8950078,0,t1_d7niyca,What do you mean wasted?

What xa does is get you past the critical energy peak and once you are past it the slope of the energy graph is reversed meaning the particles now want to be pulled together instead of repulsed things always want to be lower on the potential energy graphYoure last paragraph also sounds like you are saying that there are enough particles with energy greater than critical energy to heat up the sun and maintain fusion. This is not true almost all of the heat and energy comes from those particles that have quantum tunneled through. As OP said NGT said its not hot enough in the sun for this to happen and that is taking into account the distribution of energy that individual particles will have. Lastly the actual formulas that you reference to with distance  xa and energy is y b are determined by Schrdinger equations  The graphs on that page show some of the solutions to the equation which show probability densities and even a good graph of quantum tunneling. ,askscience,d7tg9zx,2,t5_2qm4e9000912,0,t3_53iy6y,Thank you for your submission!

Im not sure why anyone would ever propose it is let alone use that fact as a premise in an argument. Esepcially if you are going by the big bang theory. At which point would the universe suddenly become infinite?IF the universe is infinite it didnt suddenly become infinite it always was infinite. Its worth noting that this is completely consistent with the big bang theory as well. Remember the big bang was not an explosion but a rapid expansion of spacetime. This can occur even if you begin with an infinite universe! Im not sure I can really do this concept justice but you might be interested in reading about inflation theory Its unproven but quite intriguing.I think youd find that if you forced cosmologists or physicists to guess whether the universe is infinite or finite since we have no scientific data to rely on they would mostly probably want to stay agnostic but if you pushed hard enough most would bet on it being infinite in extent.gtPotential energy is a real sort of thing. Its not energy vanishing and the reappearing maybe.Energy is not what you likely learned it was in high school or even in college depending on what you studied. It is far more subtle than you realize and many people would argue that its more of an accounting device rather than a thing of any sort. The simplest most fundamental definition of energy is the quantity that is conserved by time reversal invariant processes. Since an accelerating universe is not time reversal invariant the process does not conserve energy. Since the whole universe is expanding that means the whole universe does not conserve energy globally. And there is nothing wrong with that even if it sounds crazy!Its not actually that crazy its just that physics is a lot more complex than people are led to believe in school. Its drilled into us that energy is conserved and you never see a counterexample except for open systems maybe but those dont count. Quantum mechanics is also crazy but we grow up hearing about it and how weird it is so were willing to accept its oddities. But when someone questions that simplified conservation law that was drilled in as an absolute truth its hard to shake.

It has to do that change in internal energy is equal to work and heat removed or added to the system. If there is nothing to conduct its heat away heat is zero and if there is nothing for the gas to do work on that is also zero. Also since in a vacuum the external pressure is zero no work would be done.  Change in internal energy is therefore zero and the temperature of the gas remains constant. This would also be an irreversible process because there would not be a way to get the gas back to its original state without adding work to the system and changing its temperature since in a vacuum no heat could be lost except by radiation. ,askscience,d85e0hv,2,t5_2qm4e9100302,0,t3_54xce0,Hi your submission has been removed for failure to include a descriptive question in the title.

The sources for these elements to the ocean is from the weathering of rocks on land like all other major constituents of seawater. The difference between sodium and chloride is their sinks from seawater a pretty different than other elements. The largest sink exist mechanism from seawater for these elements is basically drying up of ocean basins at the end of the Wilson cycle the life cycle of oceans. This as you can probably imagine takes hundreds of millions of years. They are not significantly used in biological functions like other major constituents in seawater. Other major constitutes of seawater like calcium magnesium sulphate ect. can get incorporated in the shells of phytoplankton or in their cells. That means these elements when the plankton die or are consumed by the higher food chain and nicely packaged into fecal pellets are heavy enough to sink out of seawater and into ocean sediments.

Therefore the DNA reading would count a mutation expressed by a single cell but not the other  in the sample as statistical noise. If the mutations occurred in stem cells or some other incompletely differentiated cell so that a significant proportion of the sample had this mutation then the signalnoise ratio may be overcome but this is unlikely due to the number of cells used and the heterogenous mix of cells in any given sample. When analysing a given sample for identification purposes only a small number of genes are checked so unless in the very rare occasion that the signalnoise ratio is overcome the mutation occurs on one of the identification genes then the sample would read identically at both time points. I imagine the likelihood of this occurring is so small that saying impossible is fair. Even sequencing the genome in situations like andme ect where the whole genome is assessed. The whole genome is not actually assessed but rather Large colllections of gene variants Called SNPs and these represent about . of the whole genome are assessed in such a way that areas of the genome are flagged rather than specific mutations identified.

We can certainly use this process or other similar techniques to do this and we have known how to do this for decades with similar methods.  Ill try to go through the problems as I see them as to why we dont do this nowFirstly is the fact that CO is a very stable molecule and that is partially why we love our fossil fuels so much as it is the basis of how much energy we get out of the stuff when we burn them.  Thermodynamically this means that we need to put in a ton of energy to convert that CO back into a liquid fuel where is has that high chemical potential energy again.  What this means practically is that you need a lot of power to get any useful quantities of the stuff.  Just pulling a few kW of power off some unused renewable source and you are still only generating ethanol on the L and kg scales even without considering the rest of the parasitic plant costs.Secondly is that CO is still rather dilute.   ppm is a lot for climate warming purposes but when you are trying to work with a starting material at . you are going to have a bad time.  Your thermodynamics are likely not going to work until you significantly concentrate the stuff and so then you are doing things like running base scrubbers that run millions of cubic feet per day of air through them just to gather enough CO to use the free power that you are trying to use.  Something on that scale is both expensive and rather large not just something that fits on a small trailer mounted skid.  Generally we dont consider these types of technology too seriously and would rather build something to stick at the exhaust end of a power plant to gather high concentration CO instead.What looks better right now?  Batteries even if we never come up with higher density or lower cost batteries.  They work off the grid as it already exists high capital cost but low operating costs and incredibly flexible in what you eventually use the energy for.  They dont directly reduce the CO in the atmosphere but even thousands of ethanol producing plants wont either.,askscience,d8zakdm,3,t5_2qm4e9339818,0,t1_d8zvpwn,removed,askscience,d8zw1jt,1,t5_2qm4e9340194,0,t3_58br4g,removed,askscience,d8zxr83,1,t5_2qm4e9341227,0,t3_58dyb8,removed,askscience,d902gj8,1,t5_2qm4e9341738,0,t1_d904874,Induced radiation?,askscience,d904s8l,9,t5_2qm4e9343224,0,t1_d90bi7n,Wow!

When this happens in messenger RNA no big deal one protein might be defective. When it happens in DNA however there may be a problem as that change will be passed down generation to generation and to every protein encoded by the affected gene. Because DNA uses Thymine however the cell knows that every Uracil it finds in the DNA is wrong leading to the replacement of uracil with the correct base cytosine.I think you have similar responses but I hope mine is a little more clear than some others.,askscience,d91gzkj,5,t5_2qm4e9353250,0,t3_58mkpt,removed,askscience,d91lb21,1,t5_2qm4e9354248,0,t1_d91paji,Now I get it.

Aside from electrical power that has a maximum due to solar array degradation there is also the problem of heat rejection for the new modules which is already going to be an issue for the existing modules in the future. More modules also changes the center of mass and affects the loads imparted on the rest of the station during reboosts and debris avoidance maneuvers so fatigue would still be an issue as it is on the current ISS design.

This is not an aspect that is exclusive to airplanes only.  Rockets mostly go horizontal.  Anyways  do you remember what the point of this thread is?   Why bother?   As you say  even gravity drag is only a fraction of the energy need to get a rocket into orbit.Do we have any guarantee that flying an airplane up to  km and up to . kms  is less than that gravity drag of the rocket when you add in all the extra energy needed for drag for much longer flying times through the first  km etc?  Add in the extra weight for the airplane fuel solid rocket boosters are very efficient and all the extra mass to make it an airplane and a rocket.For it to become a viable option  it will have to be able to do it much better than a rocket can. ,askscience,d9ayia3,2,t5_2qm4e9427550,0,t3_59siod,Hi xbq thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Whats upside down to us is right side up in many other systems. Even the rotations of galaxies cannot be known to be clockwise or counterclockwise.

The difference in pressure between the top and bottom of existing tall buildings is greater than the horizontal pressure differences that drive major storms but there are no vertical winds. Its actually normally pretty difficult to get air to move vertically you would have to mechanically force it or make it unstable by heating at the bottom or cooling at the top to get your chimney effect.,askscience,d9lba15,1,t5_2qm4e9510974,0,t1_d9kvl1y,removed,askscience,d9lfh0w,1,t5_2qm4e9513248,0,t1_d9l7m44,Perfect answer.

How the hell did they weld those gigantic sheets of steel together? The sheets were formed with pointed edges. These formed a triangular groove into which a weld could be made reducing the effective thickness of the plate to be welded. The sheets were also preheated making them melt more easily. However riveting was far more commonly used to join armour plates on Royal Navy battleships  welding was mainly used on the ships structure and on cruisers carriers and escorts which used thinner plates.,askscience,d9rfbnd,2,t5_2qm4e9561575,0,t1_d9rlv57,removed,askscience,d9rns4d,1,t5_2qm4e9561948,0,t3_5btfcs,removed,askscience,d9rpfk2,1,t5_2qm4e9564935,0,t1_d9rx0t0,removed,askscience,d9s2okq,1,t5_2qm4e9573847,0,t1_d9s7hgm,Is this true for potential energy too?

I am a master electrician and I do have quite a bit of experience with variable speed motors in industrial settings. The answer to your question would depend on whether the motor is DC or AC. If it is DC the speed of the motor would be controlled by some sort of rectifier controlling the voltage.  I would assume that this would be the case in cars.  In an AC motor the speed of large motors are controlled by a frequency drive.  It alters the frequency of the electricity entering the windings.  Smaller AC motors are regulated by current limiting devices like resistors ,askscience,d9y0op2,2,t5_2qm4e9613235,0,t1_d9y04on,gtFission will occur if a nucleus can decrease its energy by splitting into smaller constituents and fusion will occur if nuclei can reduce their energy by combining.Well both fission and fusion can be exothermic or endothermic.So you can force light nuclei to split apart or heavy nuclei to fuse you just have to put in energy.This is how most known nuclides were originally discovered fusionevaporation reactions using particle accelerators.,askscience,d9y112q,8,t5_2qm4e9614103,0,t3_5com06,removed,askscience,d9y4wfx,1,t5_2qm4e9616051,0,t3_5cobkg,removed,askscience,d9ydjt3,1,t5_2qm4e9618446,0,t1_d9yh024,deleted,askscience,d9yo6eg,1,t5_2qm4e9619943,0,t1_d9yfnee,removed,askscience,d9yutox,1,t5_2qm4e9621275,0,t1_d9z0o6w,removed,askscience,d9z0qhn,1,t5_2qm4e9623481,0,t3_5ctnar,Hi vertawillwin thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.,askscience,da2l0v0,1,t5_2qm4e9650624,0,t3_5d8bcm,This is a good question but Im going to start off by changing perspectives a bit which will hopefully give a clearer understanding of what happened in those early years after the Big Bang.The easiest way to look at the initial conditions just after the Big Bang is to imagine a sea of pure energy. No such thing can exist but its a useful conceit to get us where were going. All of the mass and matter of the Universe came out of that energy and as the early Universe expanded it reduced the density and also the temperature of that energy sea which resulted in a lot of consequential changes as a result. In the very earliest moments of the Big Bang  of a second and earlier the Universe underwent a process called inflation which I wont touch on but had the result of sort of smoothing out the energy distribution in any given corner.At this time the energy level  temperature of the Universe is so high that all fundamental forces are unified meaning they basically all act the same and are just different aspects of a unified force. The energy of the Universe at this time exists in basically a roiling cauldron of cycling particle reactions particles are continually being created and then smashed apart and transformed into other particles because the density of high energy particles is just so high. Its fairly likely that around this time a certain kind of particle that was weakly interacting started being created. These particles can only be created at super high energy conditions where these force unification physics are prevalent but they have the unusual property in that they dont interact with other particles except maybe only extremely rarely. As a consequence of this these particles would start to be precipitated out of the early Universe as energy drains away into their population since production of the particles is basically a one way street. The Universe is still expanding and cooling and its also being cooled by production of these weakly interacting particles and at some point it cools sufficiently that the conditions to create the particles the unification energy levels no longer exist and energy stops being pumped into that population of particles.Those weakly interacting particles that peaced out from the early Universe would carry away most of the energy of the Universe and would go on to form the dark matter of the later Universe interacting with regular matter almost exclusively through gravity.Next different forces basically start falling out of the unified forces until within the first second after the Big Bang all the forces as we know them are separate. There is still a roiling fury of particles being blipped into and out of existence due to the extreme temperatures but now there are somewhat more familiar particles including protons neutrons and other hadrons. At about  second after the Big Bang neutrinos decouple which means that the average energy of neutrinos being created along with the average temperature and density of the Universe favors neutrinos not interacting with matter rather than reacting. Some of the energy of the Universe at this point then escapes into what will become the cosmic neutrino background. Which still exists today though red shifted to much lower neutrino energies and consequently very difficult to detect with neutrino detectors.Up to about  seconds after the Big Bang the majority of hadrons and antihadrons annihilate leaving leptons electrons muons Taus and antileptons to dominate the remaining energy balance of the Universe because the energy level  temperature of the Universe at that point is still high enough to create leptonantilepton pairs easily. After about  seconds that changes the Universe cools beyond the point where pair creation is common and most of the remaining leptonsantileptons annihilate. For reasons we dont entirely understand yet these hadron and lepton annihilation periods leave behind some residue of matter. At this point the Universe is a hot dense plasma and most of the remaining energy of the Universe is actually in the form of photons. After a few minutes the temperature of the Universe drops enough to allow nuclei to form prior to that the average energy of photons is so high that they disintegrate nuclei as soon as they are formed. The hot dense plasma of the Universe is hot enough and dense enough to cause fusion Protons and neutrons combine to form Deuterium which fuses into Helium. This period of fusion only lasts a few minutes but it creates a substantial amount of Helium as well as some Lithium and almost no higher elements. This results in an abundance of roughly  Hydrogen  Helium nuclei of course and trace amounts of Lithium and Deuterium.For the next several tens of thousands of years the Universe continues to exist as a plasma of primarily HydrogenHelium nuclei free electrons and high energy photons. Plasma is extremely opaque to light because the electronsnuclei arent constrained into a very narrow range of energy levels. It would take over a third of a million years for the Universe to cool down enough through expansion to allow the free electrons to combine with the free HydrogenHelium nuclei and form neutral atoms that werent instantly ionized again. At which point the Universe stops being primarily opaque to light and the photons that had been bouncing around between ionized atoms now travel arbitrary distances. This is the formation of the cosmic microwave background radiation. At the time it would have been an intense visible light glow at a temperature level just slightly below that of the ionization energy of Hydrogen several thousand degrees after being redshifted over nearly  billions years of continuing spacetime expansion shifted to a temperature of under  Kelvin and into microwave radio frequencies. Afterwards the dark matter and atoms of the Universe coalesced into galaxies stars planets etc.In short before neutral atoms there were atomic nuclei and electrons in a plasma before the plasma was a sea of particles including not just protons electrons etc. but all sorts of things in a roiling soup of particles most of them shortlived not because they would decay but because theyd get destroyed in a high energy collision in the same way that a particle accelerator destroys particles.,askscience,da2n0yt,22,t5_2qm4e9651393,0,t3_5d914m,removed,askscience,da2qg3b,1,t5_2qm4e9652426,0,t1_da2tvp2,Xrays yellow light and microwaves all travel at the same speed.

From what I understand it is approaching point P due to the inflation of space within the horizon. The increasing distance increases with time until the speed that an object and point P are separating is faster than the speed of light. After the point in time where the horizon passes an object light given off from that object will never reach point P but light already in transit will continue to be redshifted and the light reaching P will slowly approach  until it is no longer detectable.If that is roughly correct then I understand that concept and I also understand the particle horizon with regards to CMBR but something breaks in my brain when I try to imagine how they would interact together. If the particle horizon is marching outwards as time goes on then the cosmic event horizon must be beyond that right?

Actually you could just think of it as Parenthesis Exponents Multiplication Addition  then its clear that we are descending some ordered list. We could have Parenthesis Double Exponents Exponents Multiplication Addition. But Double exponents are rare in basic applications.But I want to underline that this is arbitrary from another point of view. There is no theorem that says this order is correct and that doing a calculation in another order leads to an incorrect answer.

How big of a sphere of bananas would you need to sit in before the radiation field is as bad as that given of the source in say the Goinia accidentWe will build the sphere of bananas up a thin shell at a time. Interestingly radiation flux falls off as r but its area goes up as r so each shell contributes the same. The radiation flux at the center is therefore rhoalphaR where alpha is the activity and rho is the density of the potassium.Looking up numbers Rho is something like . Kgm for bananas. Activity of natural potassium is  per second per kg. The source in the Goinia accident was e per second but it was mostly beta which is  times more ionising than gamma so we actually want something like e per second from our bananas.R  e   .     .   Km. Call that accurate to  s.f.  million kmSo the answer is you need more than a planetary sized mass of bananas to produce a really dangerous radiation field at the center. I guess this is good as we live of a planetary sized source of natural background radiation and it doesnt kill us.However honestly while bananas arent lead they are going to provide shielding and  million km is a long way so actually I think the answer is that it isnt possible to pile up enough bananas to be dangerous because they would start acting as a radiation shield first.Note I assumed a human has a cross section of m so that I could make fluxes and absolute activities equivalent. I also couldnt find the density of bananas so I assumed they were as dense as water.,askscience,da9ihrw,3,t5_2qm4e9706829,0,t1_da8tjub,gt A rocket ship for instance need never reach the local escape speed at all.Nitpicking a great response.

What the octane rating is trying to measure is its tendency to detonate under compression.  In a normal car engine you spray the fuel into the cylinder compress it ignite it and then harvest the power as the piston rises from the combustion.  If the fuel combusts during the compression part and before the spark plug is supposed to kick it off then you get a phenomenon called engine knocking and that can be extremely detrimental to the engine.The octane rating is then important as engineers who design car engines will design a certain operating temperature and compression ratio into the engine.  In some cases for performance vehicles they want to increase the compression ratio and as such they need to specify a higher octane gas to avoid knocking.Note if your car manual or gas cap does not specify a higher octane fuel you should probably just use the cheapest grade.  A higher ability to withstand compression does nothing for you if your engine doesnt compress that much anyway.Also as a secondary point some different grades of gasoline will have different amounts of blended in ethanol.  Most cars shouldnt have any compatibility issues but it is important to note that you will get slightly worse gas mileage per volume with ethanol that with gasoline roughly  as much.  This means a gas with  ethanol will give you approx  of the gas mileage that unblended gas should give.  This is only really important if the different grades available to you have different compositions.,askscience,da9zqdt,10,t5_2qm4e9714802,0,t1_daa0cj3,Many modern cars can actively adjust timing to account for the difference. ,askscience,daak607,1,t5_2qm4e9716466,0,t1_da962e7,removed,askscience,daark4n,1,t5_2qm4e9717945,0,t1_daatnu0,removed,askscience,daay4fv,1,t5_2qm4e9719027,0,t1_dab09st,i say you quit while youre behind and figure out some of the grammar and spelling errors that confuse the point youre trying to make.,askscience,dab2xk7,2,t5_2qm4e9719301,0,t3_5eanmz,How soon and in what forms do you see advanced AI having a place in the everyday lives of laymen?,askscience,dab45gn,8,t5_2qm4e9720067,0,t3_5e79c7,The energy of the vacuum does actually interact gravitationally with objects. In fact it is a contribution to dark energy. However it does not attract but push because in addition to a large mass it has an equally large pressure. Pressure in general relativity repels  times stronger than mass attracts so the overall effect is repulsive.So does this violate momentum or energy conservation? Yes. These conservation laws are associated to symmetries of flat spacetime the gravitational effect of dark energy is also representable as dark energy curving spacetime into a particular shape de Sitter space without these symmetries so energy and momentum are not conserved.,askscience,dab7k5r,6,t5_2qm4e9720429,0,t3_5ec5nw,Thank you for your submission!

Ill focus on this pointgt Is it practical to do for your average website like Reddit?No. You need each user to have a private key. You cannot generate it for them because it wouldnt be private by definition. And once they have it you need to make sure that the key really belongs to its stated user. How can you achieve that? Usually by having the public key signed by a wellknown trusted entity.Such a mechanism has been put in place to authenticate websites to their users. Today if a fake website tried to disguise itself as the real reddit then you wouldnt see the green lock icon in the address bar never type a password or credit card number if theres anything wrong with such green lock icon. The X standard defined public key certificates signed by certification authorities. PGP used a simpler approach in which anyone can sign anyone elses key  how much you trust them in that case is a bit limitedAll in all if there are thousands of users for the average website its definitely possible but I wouldt call it practical.Edit SSLHTTPS does define client authentication though. This might change in the future if an appropriate infrastructure is put in place so that getting a signed public key as an average user becomes as easy as creating an account.,askscience,daf0d7g,2,t5_2qm4e9750888,0,t3_5erkj5,removed,askscience,daf0glg,1,t5_2qm4e9753602,0,t1_daenyk7,Damn.. thank you.,askscience,dafckz8,1,t5_2qm4e9757197,0,t1_dafdmka,Could someone provide a simpler explanation please?,askscience,dafsjxo,1,t5_2qm4e9758296,0,t3_5expn6,Hi FNA thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Additionally the density change of air will cause light to get slower the closer to the ground.

As for the wiring thats also hard to say especially since its hard to do research on such a taboo subject matter. We know female sexual responses are quite different from those of males especially in terms of orgasm. However anatomically these organ are more similar than one would expect the female sex organs could be describe as like the male sex organs inside out or vice versa for the male sex organs. A great deal of the muscles and other structure that make them up are developed from the same precursors and have identical scientific names such as bulbospongiosus which in males helps produce erection and in females helps with the contraction of the vaginaclitoris. Both genitalia are innervated by both the lumbar and sacral spine. What specifically do you mean by receptors that are different between sexes?

In general leukocytes search for substances known as antigens which exist on the surface of cells. Some types check your own cells either for viral antigens left when the virus enters the cell or produced by the cell as a call for help or for the lack of your own antigens which suggests that the cell is cancerous and too busy being cancer to produce the chemicals that show that I am me. Other cells such as the eosinophils shown in the gif look for molecular patterns common to the type of invader theyre made for. In this case eosinophils are primarily for defending against parasites so they look for chemical compounds common on the surface of those parasites.,askscience,dan9z00,2,t5_2qm4e9819119,0,t1_dandfej,Best answer so far.

This can be partly grasped by considering relativity  in the Suns reference frame it isnt moving so it couldnt make sense for the Earth to be attracted anywhere other than directly towards it.From the Earths reference frame it seems a bit odd. The Sun was over there  minutes ago where we see it in the sky but were being pulled to the point where we would see it if the speed of light was infinite.Whats even weirder is that this continues to hold even if the attracting object is accelerating uniformly. Somehow an objects velocity and acceleration is encoded in the gravitational data it imprints on spacetime.If Ive got this wrong Id really appreciate being put right because as I say I dont think Ive quite grasped it but I thought it fascinating enough to mention.,askscience,dao97nj,2,t5_2qm4e9828978,0,t1_dans64p,gt Why does the bolt just go out into air and not physically touch the ground?A tesla coil produces high frequency AC typically at around a few hundreds KHz . What happens is that at such frequencies the capacitive coupling between the ionised air of the bolt and the ground passes sufficient current to keep the bolt hot and ionized. Arc and the ground form a capacitor which is being charged and discharged hundreds of thousands times per second. The charging and discharging current keeps the bolt alive.At the tip of the bolt you have very high electric field which causes new electrical breakdown in the air making the bolt longer until the bolt loads the coil sufficiently that it cant keep a longer bolt hot. There is some tendency to go towards ground but when ground is not too close it will just continue into which ever direction the air happens to breakdown.The bolt typically starts from a sharp metal point on the Tesla coil. The electric field near a sharp point is very high and causes electrical breakdown in the air ionizing it then as the coil continues to oscillate it keeps feeding and expanding that bolt.Meanwhile when you get a DC discharge it can not sustain a free hanging arc because it can only charge the capacitance between said arc and the ground once which will only briefly deliver a little energy. It can only discharge into something conductive but not into empty air.,askscience,daoqk7v,1,t5_2qm4e9834332,0,t1_dap6a1y,Thank you for the response.

The first is the chance of failure during launch.  Unlike most other forms of transport when a rocket fails the results are usually catastrophic.  The possibility of scattering nuclear waste across the landscape is just too risky.The other one is mass.  Nuclear fuel and by virtue nuclear waste is generally very heavy.  The amount of fuel used in reactors is generally classified but the estimated amount of waste generated by a typical power plant is  metric tons per year .  Power plants are typically refueled every  to  months .  This means were looking at a  to  ton bare payload.  Were already in superheavy launch vehicle territory and we havent even added the actual vehicle that would carry the waste.However this would only launch the waste to LEO.  This is very dangerous because the orbit will likely eventually degrade and the waste will one day fall back to Earth in some random location along its orbital plane.  Not good.So we need to launch into an escape velocity.  This requires much more dV and thus a much larger rocket.You could of course break up the spent fuel between multiple launches but this means youre spending more time handling nuclear waste.And none of this takes into account the order of magnitude more nonfuel nuclear waste generated.  We still have to take care of that waste.Finally that nuclear waste might not be worth anything today but its entirely possible that it could be reprocessed into usable fuel and other useful products.  This is especially true of the waste being generated right now.  We almost certainly wont be able to dig up and launch longsince buried waste so well only be launching the most potentially useful waste into space.     ,askscience,dapp3ft,11,t5_2qm4e9837018,0,t3_5g66g8,Hi xLegitBrit thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Finally analysis indicates that the total cost of batteries is unlikely to change much if the price of Li increases.

Outside in the normal flatish universe space is a fixed coordinate grid and time flows inexorably forwards. Inside a black hole time stops and space flows unstopably towards the singularity.Put another way the singularity isnt a point in space at the center of a black hole it is a point in the future. The event horizon is defined as the radius within which all of your possible futures end at the singularity. Once you are within the event horizon there is no direction you can turn which is out. All directions are in towards the singularity in your future. In fact if your goal is to survive as long as possible your best move is just to free fall. Because the singularity is in every direction any attempt to accelerate in any direction only gets you there sooner than had you done nothing at all. There is literally no way out without going backwards in time.With this being said it is difficult to envision any object with properties that allow it to escape unless it inherently travels backward in time which tends to violate cause and effect and so is not generally expected to exist.,askscience,db2suqg,159,t5_2qm4e9937592,0,t3_5htov9,removed,askscience,db2w6gl,1,t5_2qm4e9938047,0,t1_db1bj2y,gt Ive never heard that.Not entirely sure why you got so downvoted  Ive never heard that either...but maybe its dependent on the field?

For example while beef has a terrible carbon footprint pork and chicken is alarmingly low  by many estimates less than fruit.  For example I see this page linked often by people proudly proclaiming how good their vegan diet is for the environment.  Indeed the splash picture up top certainly suggests that.  But just a little further down is a far more nuanced breakdown of different diets sourced to the USDA and EIOLCA.  The good news is that yes your vegan diet is indeed almost inarguably going to be better than a steaklovers.  However its not going to necessarily be all that much better than a healthy balanced chickenandpork eaters diet.  Measurably perhaps but not the biggest help in combating climate change.  As well it is more than possible to be extremely irresponsible with a vegan diet.  For example as this now infamous study asserts its entirely possible for a fruitheavy diet relying on worldwide shipping and questionable agriculture practices to be worse for the environment than a porkheavy diet.  I would argue that these risks are manageable and you can do a lot by buying local and having a good understanding of your food supply chain.  I cant speak for you of course but many vegans or vegetarians just assume that their diet is better because they cut out the worst things.

Its not secretly hiding waiting for us to measure so it can tell us where it is it is everywhere simultaneously. Dont think of particles as things think of them more like vibrations. Particles are like the vibrations in a drum head and the different patterns in the vibration are the different possible states for the particle. You cant really ask a vibration in a drum where it is or how its moving because its a vibration. Similarly asking an electron where it is is kinda illposed because a single location is not a property of a vibration. It tries to answer though. The instant a drumstick hits the drum there is only vibration at that one point and after any time has passed it spreads out. When you ask to measure the location of an electron it is put in a vibrating state similar to this and then spreads out. The weirdness of QM is a result of us asking about quantities that are not natural things to ask of quantum objects like location and momentum etc.The Schrodinger Equation tells us how these vibrations spread out evolve and interact with other particles. It is common to mainly work with the TimeIndependent Schrodinger Equation in introductory courses but thats just a special case the full one tells us how these vibrations spread out its actually a Heat Equation. The Schrodinger Equation makes QM deterministic. If you have two particles given by two wavefunctions that are interacting then we can use the Schrodinger Equation to know exactly how these wavefunctions will combine interact evolve. Everything. QM is deterministic but deterministic as wavefunctions. The supposed randomness comes from us trying to predict the behavior of things that arent the wave function as a whole.Overall though measurement is an odd thing in QM. Its not really understood and is actually an important problem for various interpretations of QM. How I see it is that particles are indifferent to us or the concept of measurement. Instead particles just interact as they interact and this interaction is completely predictable in a closed system.  But when we do try to measure a system we have to open it to the rest of the universe. In this way the wave function of the previously closed system leaks out into the rest of the universe which is unpredictable. This gives the illusion that wavefunction collapses when in reality it is interacting with the outside wavefunction of the universe. We say that the quantum state loses its coherence with itself. Quantum Decoherence is a mechanism used in many interpretations of QM to avoid the problem of measurement by saying that wavefunction collapse doesnt actually happen.So there arent tiny particles or packets bouncing around and we just dont know it particles are their wave functions and wave functions evolve and interact in a deterministic way via the Schrodinger Equation.  Just as the heat on a rod evolves predictably based on the Heat Equation so do particles via the Schrodinger Equation. Asking what a wave function is is like asking what the stuff one of these nonexistent discrete electron balls is made out of it doesnt make sense.,askscience,db75t6l,53,t5_2qm4e9971348,0,t3_5idf4o,removed,askscience,db7akwb,1,t5_2qm4e9973102,0,t3_5iee1l,removed,askscience,db7itby,1,t5_2qm4e9974842,0,t3_5ifdev,Thank you for your submission!

In this I mean even though you cannot count the real numbers between  and  you can still come up with a method for picking a number between any a and b between  and  including the two. Consider the midpoint method. These methods are not chaotic. They are not sensitive to initial conditions and in a general sense this means there is an order in the general sense of the definition as you can systematically generate the reals to any given level of a desired precision.

They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earths surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica. So we have to use fireelectrolysis to extract the pure form from the rocks they love to form.However planets can form from oxygenpoor planetary discs creating what are known as carbon planetsThese planets would not have the same issues as our oxygenrich world and alkali metal could occur naturally in their pure form.Pure alkali metals could provide civilisations that arise on these worlds with a fireless energy source.,askscience,db89238,29,t5_2qm4e9983087,0,t1_db7v955,removed,askscience,db8tov7,1,t5_2qm4e9986959,0,t1_db9bfgp,removed,askscience,db9buft,0,t5_2qm4e9986983,0,t3_5imhh8,removed,askscience,db9byhj,1,t5_2qm4e9987430,0,t1_db9dz81,removed,askscience,db9e1wn,-9,t5_2qm4e9988260,0,t3_5ina2f,Hi CMPunkISGOAT thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

If the gasses are also trapped in with or very close to the lava the air will slowly press through the microscopic cracks and crevices between dirt and rock.  Relieving the pressure before it can replenish itself van cause a pressure void.  The problem is what happens as the pressure void grows? Earth is pushing down on it and releasing the gasses means theres less pushing up.  Conversely theres also less pushing down against the core.  Now we actually know that the pressure wont really change but that doesnt mean that area wont compress.  The earth above it can sink into the void causing any number of problems or the molten rock can rise up into it.Again Im not sure this will actually happen but we should probably investigate this issue before enacting any plans.,askscience,dbmdxur,1,t5_2qm4e10087293,0,t1_dbmdov1,Thats a very nice sentence but quantum mechanics unfortunately says its not actually right.

Thats a difficult problem.  If you gathered water into such a large volume its own gravity would likely keep it in the ball shape.  It would likely have an ice core and some sort of vapor at the surface  so it wouldnt really be a giant ball of water at all.There are a few complications  as water is one of the very few materials that increases in volume when it transitions to a solid state at least in the Earth environment  I dont know off hand if that changes at huge pressure.  The problem suggests a very complicated dynamic set of equations would be needed between the phase transition and the surface tension to figure out the composition of a sun sized ball of HODepending on the speed they run into each other youd either have them each stealing pieces of each other  think like this Or they would combine into one giant mass.  It may or may not still be a star  depends if it is massive enough to keep the fusion going.   My guess on that is that something the size of the sun or two suns is several orders of magnitude too small to keep the fusion going open question though Im not too confident in that  so in that case it would become a dull blob of matter  effectively extinguishing the sun  big enough to hold itself together but not big enough to burn.Neat thought experiment.,askscience,dbnprtj,2,t5_2qm4e10099927,0,t3_5kggms,removed,askscience,dbo18q6,1,t5_2qm4e10100368,0,t1_dbo0ux6,One thing thats happening now is that installers are moving to larger panels thus reducing the labor and racking costs since those are more related to panel quantity than they are panel capacity.

Explosive volcanoes are made up of many layers of ash and lava and pumice and so on each of which have different strengths and properties. These can then be further knackered by dyke injections or faults. This means theyre riddled with weaknesses. In Mt St Helens case one of these weak sections was lubricated by glacial meltwater. That lead to a flank collapse giant landslide that removed about  of the volcanoes mass. That then depressurised the magma chamber below which causes the gas dissolved in the magma to come out of solution like bursting a coke bottle.

The partition function includes the ensembleaveraged potential energy for all of the binary molecular interactions. And the total internal energy of the system does not only include kinetic energy it must also include the average molecular potential energy. Its the reason why water has a higher boiling point than other comparable liquids hydrogen bonds are a favorable interaction and the molecules orient themselves in a way that the bond energies dont just cancel out. And I still dont see how to reconcile the MB distribution working for a liquid with the conclusion that liquids must then also satisfy the ideal gas law.I might have misread that paper though.

If you look at the EnergyBand Model for metals youll find that in a metal the valence electrons are delocalized youve probably hear the term electron sea to describe metals.  This causes the finite wavelengths to broaden into bands.  The number of energy levels in these solids is dependent on the number of atoms that comprise it.  Which is fairly large.  So despite that the energy levels are still quantized there are so many so close together that its nearly impossible to tell it apart from a continuous spectrum.  This is usually talked about in electrical properties such as conduction in metals.  The Pauli exclusion principle is used as the reason that these valence electrons must take different energy levels.,askscience,dchchos,2,t5_2qm4e10351784,0,t3_5o56rd,deleted,askscience,dchfo5v,1,t5_2qm4e10352904,0,t1_dchjxet,Yeah.

An electric dipole is in principle a positive charge slightly offset from a negative charge.   Oscillate this relative position and you get EM radiation.There is no negatively gravitationally charged massenergy as far as we are aware.

Weve explored it in the form of spectroscopy. That is weve studied the light that reaches us or our probes. That can tell us quite a bit about the composition. We can calculate its mass by studying its orbit because we understand orbital mechanics very well. We can calculate its volume because it is pretty close to a sphere and we can measure its radius. So we can calculate the density and that can also tell us about the composition. We can study the way it spins to get information about the distribution of mass.Take a look at this article Note that the article doesnt make claims as facts it lists evidence and reasoning. Scientists study evidence and form conclusions that fit the evidence. and then present that evidence and their reasoning for other scientists to critique. And then refine their conclusions if necessary.gtOr when its supposed to be understood that the Earth has x amount of layers and each layer is a certain thickness composition temperature etc. We have no idea whats down there or what the core of the earth is made of so why speculate?Again we have good evidence. Enough to make solid inferences. If you are actually interested Id be happy to explain it to you.

This is the hard thing to think about when working with large numbers. Most people in college will think about it and say that they have lived  million seconds. They would be right as you reach this point in about  days. Now almost no one would be able to say that they have lived a billion seconds which is  years. Ive seen this happen and it was a toss up in my class. Only the teacher and one other were  and  raised their hands when asked if they lived a billion years. Now take that to consideration when I tell you that the universe will most likely end up in heat death in a range from  to  years. This is a massive inaccuracy but for perspective the universe is only about  years old.  is  times less than  which is  times less than  and so on. With a safe minimum of  years heat death is not even minutely close to  billion years from now. Heat death in the universe is also largely based proton decay. We are still out on this idea. We have never seen natural proton decay. This is important because the idea of heat death requires there to be no energy gradient in the universe as time approaches infinity meaning energy is perfectly distributed.. Think of it like a perfectly blank perfectly flat piece of paper. Nothing of note anywhere on it. A proton would be a tiny but very important scuff on that paper and given  years the universe can randomly start anew with a new big bang not a proven idea,askscience,dcm65q2,8,t5_2qm4e10394708,0,t1_dclacmc,gtAt low frequencies for example higher humidity is better.

For instance if you know the values of fz  sinz on the set S      ... then those values determine the values for all z because the set S has an accumulation point at z   which is within the domain of analyticity.However suppose you knew the values of fz  sinz on the same set S. The point z   is not within the domain of analyticity of fz. So these values do not determine the values of fz elsewhere. That is there are other functions analytic on a set containing S which are not equal to fz.The proper statement of the theorem is let U be some open set of complex numbers with f analytic on U. Then either f is constant or the set z fz   is totally disconnected.

It travels through space through the atmosphere through your window and into your house.Absorption is when that energy is converted into something else like thermal energy.  So think about a microwave oven.Its interesting that youre asking about those specific frequencies.  Those are pretty low and solidly in the radio spectrum.  Do you have a specific concern?  Do you work with RF radiation?I know there are standards for safe exposure to radio frequency fields.  The biggest risk isnt cancer since were talking about nonionizing radiation.

Bacteria for example might replicate with a life cycle of hours or days but they might be in a stable environment and their traits may end up being largely unchanged over millions or even billions of years as a consequence.Evolution always relies on both the potential for genetic variation through diversity in the population especially in species that sexually reproduce or through mutation as well as environmental selection pressures.,askscience,dcrs0ls,25,t5_2qm4e10450348,0,t3_5pou63,Thank you for your submission!

Their temperature is low because temperature by definition is the average random kinetic energy energy from objects flying or vibrating or rotating. But even if you touch it its gonna take a tiny amount of your heat away really negligible. You can find out and do the math yourself. E.g a basketball hitting a grain of sand will greatly alter the temperature of that grain of sand but the energy of the basketball will not change much. For your second question again it depends on the rate of radiation. A wall is relatively cool and will radiate less than say the sun. About how hot it is I cant answer you because I dont have the numbers. But the stray particles in space will not likely to heat up anything they touch by a decent amount.

I have an automotive technology degree and learned plenty about battery storage.  The reason you dont store a battery on concrete is it will fail eventually due to the prolonged temperature difference between the bottom and top of the battery.  This was explained to us and also demonstrated and I graduated in  so we are talking about modern batteries.  This is why you place it on wood or rubber to insulate the battery from the cold concrete.Its also worth mentioning that modern batteries do not leak as much as some comments are suggesting.  In fact leakage occurs from improper handeling of a battery such as tipping it or knocking it around.  All car batteries vent hydrogen gas during use or temperature increases but the sulfuric acid is designed to stay contained.  Any leakage of the electrolyte would mean a defective battery and would have to be tossed anyway instead of stored.Its also important to note that batteries create electricity by means of a chemical reaction so changes in temperature are going to have effects on that reaction.  The primary one being the cold which is why car batteries are labeled with CCA which is cold cranking amps and is a measurement of how many amps a battery can output at given temperatures.  More expensive batteries will have better CCA.  By the way I noticed a lot of comments suggesting the reason not to store car batteries on concrete is because the concrete will get damaged.  If people are destroying concrete while storing batteries then they are not handeling the battery properly.  Its very easy to store and move batteries without destroying them but leaving them on concrete will cause them to fail prematurely.,askscience,dcv2gxe,35,t5_2qm4e10478956,0,t1_dcvw6k9,removed,askscience,dcvwc6w,1,t5_2qm4e10489609,0,t3_5q859p,Hi TheSaltySloth thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Are you ascribing some kind of structure within the Schwarzchild radius?  Im not quite certain I grok this.Black holes must have a lot of structure to withhold the very large entropy we know they have. However the classical description offers next to no structure which means this description is grossly incomplete  it is a macroscopic or thermodynamic picture. The microscopic structure of BHs instead exists therefore at the quantumgravitational level. Example you know a gas at equilibrium has a state described by a few variables volume pressure... and so appears to have a very small amount of information it can store. However you are using a very limited picture and youre missing the massive amount of information about the huge number of molecules composing the gas. This information is unreadable to you the macroscopic observer but it would be in principle accessible to a microscopic observer with maximal information. This excess information he has wrt you is the entropy. His information is conserved quantum mechanics says so yours isnt because during irreversible transformations part of what you know can get scrambled and switch over to what you dont know thats an increase in entropy.There is some strong hints that the microscopic structure of a black hole is not inside the horizon but right outside in a Planckthick Planckhot boiling membrane right above the horizon where spacetime literally ends with no interior. More precisely this is the description of a faraway observer. The boiling membrane holds the very large entropy of the black hole in its many microstates and the blackbody radiation from the membrane is the Hawking radiation.gtConserved  Im not sure this holds.  Youre claiming that the chemical process of the combustion of ink and paper can be reversed?  To recover the information contained in the writing?  This sounds like a metaphor. Not a metaphor If you have maximal information about the system which means knowing as much as possible about all the molecules you can reverse the equations of motion and reconstruct the message. The microscopic information is conserved  a fact known as unitarity in quantum mechanics. Instead your macroscopic information instead can decrease in processes such as burning because it is based on macroscopic observables only. ,askscience,dcxps7t,3,t5_2qm4e10497913,0,t1_dcwyis0,Thanks for this explanation.

When you fire a rocket in space you ARE pushing against something.  That is you ARE pushing the rocket material out at great speed.  Essentially you are pushing out against the gases  which pushes the gases out and pushes you back in the other direction.  Thus the total momentum is still zero since the mass times the velocity of the ejected rocket material will match your mass times your velocity which is in the opposite direction  so if you add them or net momentum it remains there same ie conservation of momentum.Only recently the EM drive has been proposed which claims to push the rocket in one direction without ejecting any mass.

You just separately need to prove that   . Perhaps the simplest way to prove it is to write               .So any number x has a nonnegative square whence  lt   x or x   gt  for all x. This is true in any ordered field not just the real numbers. In particular this shows that the complex numbers are not an ordered field. Finite fields are also not ordered fields. In fact I believe this actually characterizes which fields can be made into ordered fields. That is a field is orderable if and only if  cannot be written as a sum of squares.,askscience,dd30djo,27,t5_2qm4e10549752,0,t1_dd3x77h,removed,askscience,dd3xl3v,1,t5_2qm4e10549795,0,t1_dd3xk7o,No like imagine a shooting a bullet through a ball.

There is evidence that synonymous mutations can have functional consequences but if someone gives you a random synonymous mutation it would be reasonable to guess that it has less of a functional impact compared to a random nonsynonymous mutation.    gt In most cases and especially in the case of conserved genes there are expected to be more synonymous mutations than nonsynonymous    Im not sure that this is true. I assume what you are alluding to here is the dnds ratio. This ratio does not only consider the raw numbers of mutations but also normalizes for the number of targets within a gene so to speak. Roughly speaking mutations within the first two codon positions are nonsynonymous while mutations in the third position are synonymous. Strictly speaking this isnt true because there are codons that are fold degenerate or fold degenerate rather than fold degenerate but considering only the fourfold degenerate codons is sufficient to make the point. Because each codon contains two sites that can be nonsynonymously mutated but only one that can be synonymously mutated random mutations are twice as likely to be nonsynonymous. As a result even if a gene is under strong selection it is entirely possible that the raw number of nonsynonymous mutations is larger than the number of synonymous mutations. I also dont think that the results that the OP raises can be explained by conservation or degeneracy. ,askscience,dd4c5h3,1,t5_2qm4e10554670,0,t3_5r5243,Hi Jaebay thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Its an active area of research in both theoretical and experimental nuclear physics. It builds on the framework of quantummechanical scattering theory. And there are entire textbooks written on it.Starting with a simple system like a target nucleus and a proton you can solve the timeindependent Schrodinger equation for scattering or resonant states E gt . Since the Hamiltonian is complicated it will need to be solved numerically. You can then find the radial wavefunctions. Imposing scattering boundary conditions you can extract Smatrix elementsThis gives you a measure of how much particle flux is coming out of the target nucleus relative to the amount of flux that went in. This tells you about particle absorption by the nucleus or just a general loss of flux to other reaction channels.From the Smatrix element you can calculate a scattering amplitude and therefore a cross section. The cross sections will exhibit bumps at resonances.This just covers scattering but you can extend the formalism to direct reactions and then compound reactions. Compound reactions are the most complicated and fusion is a compound reaction.But anyway we know very well what is going on during nuclear reactions.

And sucking it off from the wing improves aerodynamic efficiency by minimizing drag created by this turbulent air. The boundary layer is mixed with the Bs exhaust before it is expelled reducing infrared signature. So this gap between intake and fuselage serves in stealth aircraft to minimize IR signature and improve aerodynamic efficiency by pumping the boundary layer off the fuselage.,askscience,ddhyp4m,84,t5_2qm4e10685758,0,t3_5svmh4,removed,askscience,ddi5m0s,1,t5_2qm4e10687298,0,t1_ddi6lj7,removed,askscience,ddibcq0,1,t5_2qm4e10688445,0,t3_5swvda,Thank you for your submission!

It can be derived by general considerations of quantum gravity that dont depend on the details of the actual model. Theyre based on pretty innocuous assumptions.gtFor example Hawking radiation invokes QFT which we know to be right in curved spacetime which we also know to be right QFT on curved spacetime is just quantum gravity to one loop aka semiclassical gravity. It is computable independently of the UV completion of GR because quantum GR is renormalizable to loop but this doesnt work from loops onwards.But we dont know it to be right in the sense that it is tested physics. We only trust it because it is a necessary conclusion from the consistency of the quantum theory a purely theoretical argument.

This is actually one area of anthropologyhistory that Jared Diamond got right lots of his other stuff is dubious at best. With the exception of alpacas llamas and vicunas the Americas lacked domesticated herd animals. This is partially due to the fact that most animals in the Americas simply arent particularly amenable to domestication. In the Old World the domestication of animals cooccurred with increasing population densities. Most epidemics from the Old World are zoonoses meaning that they are passed from animals to humans. As we begin living in close association with animals and one another new strains of diseases are created. These epidemics would typically only infect small portions of the population at any one time. Immunologically people had many more defenses against these diseases than in the New World. Because Native Americans never domesticated animals and because populations were sufficiently large across both continents epidemics introduced by Europeans spread quite easily. Because Native Americans never developed herd animals that would aid in the development of zoonoses there were fewer diseases that could be passed along to Europeans.,askscience,ddvpgza,29,t5_2qm4e10823296,0,t1_ddwc0ze,removed,askscience,ddwci27,1,t5_2qm4e10823480,0,t1_ddwc571,removed,askscience,ddwd6n5,1,t5_2qm4e10824369,0,t3_5uscc9,removed,askscience,ddwgh8r,0,t5_2qm4e10825402,0,t1_ddwilok,Carcinogen means increases the probability of developing cancer cells by at least some value defined by the medical community.  Every time a cell doesnt go through cell death as normal or any time a cell divides into new cells there is a chance to get cancer.  That is always happening so you always have a baseline susceptibility.  Compounds that interfere with those cell processes are often carcinogenic cells exposed to the material become more likely to malfunction and become cancerous.  If you breath burning tobacco into your lungs on purpose every day many times a day for  years you are nearly certain to develop cancer in the cells exposed to that much smoke even discounting all the weird ass chemicals they put in there these days.  If you breath smokey air as the result of a fire throughout your life that is still thousands of times less exposure than smoking over the same period.  However you would expect to see a slightly increased incidence of lung cancer in a wood burning population.,askscience,ddwkb7a,5,t5_2qm4e10825496,0,t3_5uquln,Alright Im going to be dividing your question into two parts. Q. Why is Hydrochloric acid a covalent compound?A   How HCl is a polar covalent compound  HCl is called covalent because both hydrogen and chlorine atoms share one electron with each other to            satisfy their respective valence shells and hence they form covalent bond. First of all the main thing you must realise is that no compound is purely covalent or ionic. Every                  compound possess some degree of each character i.e ionic  and covalent. In the case of HCl the two electrons involved in covalent bond are drawn a bit towards the Chlorine atom     because Cl is more electronegative than H. As a result the chlorine atom develops a small negative charge and hydrogen atom attains a small positive charge which results in an ionic character in HCl.  And hence HCl is called as a polar covalent bond. Q. Why its called as hydrogen chloride?A The main difference you ought to know about Hydrochloric acid and hydrogen chloride is that hydrochloric acid is HClaq whilst hydrogen chloride is HClg. When hydrogen chloride dissolves in water it forms hydrochloric acid.HClg                                Water gt  HClaqHydrogen Chloride                                Hydrochloric acid,askscience,ddwknrd,3,t5_2qm4e10825512,0,t1_ddwkggm,removed,askscience,ddwkpwa,1,t5_2qm4e10829747,0,t3_5uqlow,One thing Im not seeing here is that smell is a very human experience.

When these hydrogen atoms deexcite this light is emitted by them as electrons drop down from the rd electron orbital down to the nd. Theres also a little bit of red contributed from doubly ionized sulfur atoms.The green color is mostly from doubly ionized oxygen. Again nearby stars emit UV and excite oxygen which then emits two slightly different colors of green right around  nanometers. Theres also some green contributed when electrons in excited hydrogen atoms drop from the th orbital down to the second.Finally blue is pretty sparse but comes mostly from actual starlight reflecting off gas and dust in the nebula.

Thats why on xray it looks whiteopaque on the outside and darkergrey on the inside.By saying its hollow however Im not implying its weak. Its not.So the first thing they do is ream out the marrow with... You guessed it! A reamer. The diameter of which is determined by the size of the rod they determined this particular femur needed.The rod has serrations on either end that allow it to be hammered in but make the opposite movement difficult.They then do this for the other side. Though to be honest Ive forgotten how they bring the opposite be ends of the fracture together....The reamer is used with a guide wire its actually thicker than a wire and lots and lots of x rays are taken to make sure the reamer stays on course and doesnt deviate from the marrow to the cortex the thicker outer part I mentioned earlier.,askscience,de75l73,58,t5_2qm4e10929700,0,t1_de77cjj,removed,askscience,de7blcb,1,t5_2qm4e10930118,0,t1_de7ci44,Titan which is a moon has an atmospheric pressure about  of Earths atmosphere but is less massive and has a lower gravity than any of the planets though it is slightly bigger in size than Mercury.,askscience,de7d53b,11,t5_2qm4e10930756,0,t1_de7e70t,A silver bracelet wouldnt be a problem then ?,askscience,de7fiab,2,t5_2qm4e10930983,0,t3_5w5m4q,removed,askscience,de7gcmg,1,t5_2qm4e10931056,0,t1_de7fiab,removed,askscience,de7gme6,1,t5_2qm4e10932887,0,t1_de7gc3k,SO prove me wrong then and we are changing an atmosphere by existing  we cant create one from nothing.,askscience,de7nf8f,1,t5_2qm4e10933820,0,t1_de7naj8,removed,askscience,de7qw2m,1,t5_2qm4e10947601,0,t3_5wbfdf,removed,askscience,de961kw,1,t5_2qm4e10952559,0,t3_5w2v7z,removed,askscience,de9ofx9,1,t5_2qm4e10955649,0,t1_de9nn5d,removed,askscience,de9zwry,1,t5_2qm4e10956005,0,t1_de987ue,Wouldnt standing at one of the poles count as being a little bit closer to the core assuming the core is at the center because as far as I know the earths actual shape has its poles a little bit sunken like an orange.Do correct me if Im wrong.,askscience,dea18cl,2,t5_2qm4e10956689,0,t3_5whoi3,removed,askscience,dea3ru5,1,t5_2qm4e10957496,0,t1_dea3336,removed,askscience,dea6rog,1,t5_2qm4e10958155,0,t1_dea238y,Well in theory this is one of the things that drilling mud is supposed to prevent.

Wires are not perfect conductors as they also have resistive and inductive properties. The most important one here is the inductive property. The voltage produced in an inductive element is proportional to the rate of change of current. So if you have some current running through an outlet and into a device then you suddenly unplug the device from the outlet the rate of change of current is extremely large because the time it took to go from some current to zero current was a very small amount of time.So initial current  final  current  very small time  big number where the big number is actually a big voltage.The large voltage produced is enough to cause electrons to jump from one end of the wire through the air dielectric breakdown of air and onto the next wire. So the large voltage made the air conductive for just a small moment in time and it was enough to cause electrons to jump from one wire to another.That current through the air is the spark.,askscience,deafo3n,2,t5_2qm4e10964258,0,t3_5wkxvc,Hi YoungLivinOldLife thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

Thats an overly extreme situation. Were not looking for massively different behaviors here. Its a question of whether you decide to itch your nose or your knee first. Whether you blink now or one millisecond from now. Two things that are nearly equivalent in terms of should I do this now? could certainly be swayed by a single neuron in some cases and now were firmly in butterfly effect territory. Im not saying there are many of these quantuminfluenced decisions per day but I dont think its reasonable to write them off.  This is interesting in the question of free will of course. I feel that our universe is fully deterministic in that theres one outcome and theres nothing that can be done to avoid that outcome. But since its impossible to predict the outcomes of quantum events since we can never know the starting conditions in appropriate detail theres no way we can predict the behavior of any system including the brain with total confidence and accuracy. So we are still free in that nobody will be able to make forecasts of where our admittedly fixed path is taking us. I think the computer needed to do that prediction would have to be as large as and identical in composition to the observable universe. Happy to hear feedback if any of this seems offbase.  Edit how did this comment not contribute to discussion?

This condition admits many different formulations but most of the time is understood as a cancellation of the conformal anomaly. Ill try to translateWhen you have a classical theory with a certain symmetry after you quantize whatever that means it to make a quantum theory then there is no guarantee the symmetry still exists at the quantum level. If it doesnt you speak of an anomaly. Some anomalies are innocuous and even desirable for example quantum chromodynamics has a classical scale invariance which is quantummechanically broken to this anomaly we quite literally owe the weight of the world since it gives mass to hadrons. Some anomalies are very bad and basically mean the theory is inconsistent that is the theory never really existed and youre kidding yourself by studying what is essentially a phantom. A gauge anomaly is an example of an anomaly that can never happen so you need to count up all the contribution to a gauge anomaly and verify they sum to zero or the theory is dead. The Standard Model is an example of a theory with a potential gauge anomaly but whose complex arrangement of particles and their charges allows for a nontrivial cancellation of the overall anomaly resulting in a safe theory.String theories have a classical symmetry the conformal symmetry which I can vaguely describe as stretching or shrinking of the string worldsheet which is a type of gauge symmetry. There is in general an anomaly of this symmetry at the quantum level. Each dimension the string moves in brings a bit of anomaly plus theres another constant bit with the opposite sign and they cancel to zero only for a specific number of dimensions called the critical dimension. For supersymmetric strings superstrings D   while for bosonic string theory D  . Thats respectively  time and  space dimensions and  time and  space dimensions. So string theories are only consistent in the critical dimension and microscopically that is at the scale of the strings you must have that number of dimensions. Theres a similar condition in Mtheory though harder to understand since there are no strings there which gives D  .I should probably note that it is possible to correct strings theory to get cancellation of the conformal anomaly in a dimension lower than the critical one by inserting additional objects in the theory. That gives noncritical string theory and theyre theoretically interesting theories but dont work like normal string theories at all. Lets put these aside.So how do you get a dimensional Universe from a dimensional microscopic theory? There are a few ways the most popular way being compactifications. In a compactification you make the  extra dimensions compact by knotting them into a dimensional shape with finite size. To observers much smaller than this size space is dimensional. To someone much larger the extra dimensions are too small and you get an effectively dimensional Universe. Im handwaving a lot here because this doesnt actually work without including quantum mechanics in the discussion but bear with me.Why should this proposal not be considered contrived? Because extra hidden dimensions are not a burden but a blessing. They create extra structure particles forces in the dimensional lowenergy theory which is supposed to be us. Strings can wrap around the extra dimensions to produce additional states and string theory fields can flow through the tunnels and crevices in the dimensional shape. The chances of being able to reconstruct something like the standard model are very high.gtHow is adding these dimensions then stating that they exist but we have not detected them scientifically sound? But these are not added because we like them. They are a consistency condition. It would be unscientific if we had two hypothesesA string theory and there are no extra dimensionsB string theory and there are extra dimensionsthen I would agree that choosing B over A with no guiding experimental data would be unscientific since B is overcomplicated. You choose the simplest hypothesis from those that work. The point however is A does not exist. Mathematically it makes no sense. String theory only exists in the critical dimension. So extra dimensions are not part of the hypothesis they are a prediction of string theory. To compare consider the Higgs boson. The existence of this particle was predicted decades before experimental data was available thanks only to consistency conditions. Why didnt anyone contest that the addition of a thenunobservable particle was an overcomplication and thus an unscientific proposal? Because again the alternative there is simply nothing new at the EW scale did not actually exist. It was inconsistent. Now there were other equally consistent alternatives but they all added structure and arguably the theory that turned out to be correct was the simplest if not one of the simplest.The same happens with string theory. We have not yet found an alternative working theory of quantum gravity without extra dimensions thus the latter are not an unnecessary complication.,askscience,dekht63,16,t5_2qm4e11050225,0,t1_dekioby,removed,askscience,dekivah,0,t5_2qm4e11050434,0,t3_5xorpi,removed,askscience,dekjpzn,1,t5_2qm4e11050441,0,t3_5xspl1,Thank you for your submission!

A pendulum in a grandfather clock completes one swing a second or one complete oscillation in two seconds.One point not mentioned however is that the time it takes a pendulum to complete a swing or an oscillation is dependent only on the length of the pendulum not how high the pendulum swings. Pull a pendulum back further and it swings faster in terms of distance travelled than one moving only slightly from side to side but both take the same time to complete a swing. This is the key principle behind a pendulum clock.

The issue is we have great imaginations and we are good at coming up with possible ways the rules could be broken but we have no evidence of anything actually breaking them. This will unfortunately never be a solved issue. Because it is very very difficult to prove a negative. I.E. As long as the universe continues to exist its very difficult to say something is impossible. In fact in physics the only scenarios that are impossible are those which are specifically prohibited.So the issue is there is no way to prove we cant go faster than light until the universe is over. As long as there are still possible scenarios to run in the universe we cant ever be certain. But that said this is just a fact of nature.

Namely scientists noticed that these particles were produced in pairs but could decay individually. For instance a negative pion smashing into a proton can produce a kaon and a sigma baryon both strange particles but never a pion and a sigma baryon because the pion isnt strange. As for decays all strange particles are unstable so they eventually decay into particles which are not strange like electrons or pions.Not only that but the timescales were vastly different  production timescale was  seconds while the decay timescale was only  seconds. All of these point to the fact that the processes of creation and decay are governed by different fundamental forces  now we know them to be the strong and the weak force respectively. Strangeness was introduced as a quantum number which would be conserved by the strong force but not the weak force. So in the example I gave above the initial state has  strangeness no strange quarks in neither the proton nor the pion the kaon has strangeness  because it has an antistrange valence quark and the sigma baryon has a strange quark so it has strangeness  to cancel out the kaons strangeness.,askscience,dell2y4,2,t5_2qm4e11060007,0,t1_delgd7l,Ya if the goal is just to deter behavior I agree free will is unnecessary.

We already know that that definition gets fuzzy at low pressure for example because if theres nothing to bump into really hot particles arent hot because they dont bump into other particles. We need a better definition. In fact forget about temperature altogether.A much cleaner approach is how likely a system is in a given state. Thats probability thats familiar ground. For example you know that when rolling two dice a  is much more likely than a . Why? Because there are more possible combinations for        than for  . We define us a measurement for that. We call it entropy and what we mean with it is how many possible configurations a system can be in for a given state. A sum of  for two dice has an entropy of  possible configurations and a  has an entropy of  possible configurations. I kid you not its that simple only the physical entropy deals with particles instead of dice and Ive left out a logarithm and a constant.Now there was an observation at the beginning of that paragraph States of higher entropy are more likely than states with lower entropy by pure probability. This is the famous nd law of thermodynamics. If a system is going to change its more like to change towards higher entropy and over time that averages to entropy only ever increasing in a closed system. You can do more funny things with that definition. For example it follows that an empty space does not have entropy. You have to have something to count for it. And if you put two of these systems together probability makes things wander around.Remember our  dice? Lets put  dice in a row. Two of them show combined  the other two show combined . these are the possible states of the system      Now take the middle two of them and roll them again until the sum of the eyes are the same again. If you started with say  end once you get  again. After that look at the possible states of the left side and the right side. With a very high probability in fact with every change in the configuration the left two dice will now have more possible configurations and thus higher entropy and the right ones will have less possible states and thus lower entropy.Now this finally coincides with temperature and is in fact the definition of temperature. We define temperature as the likelihood that a system will give up energy eye sum in the dice analogy to a neighbouring system by comparing their entropies. In the real world a system with lots of particles whirring around at lots of different speeds has a gazillion possible configurations and a cold ice crystal has less different configurations of movement so when the two get together the whirring chaotic warm particles will bump into the slow cold particles and transfer energy.Now for the trick of negative temperature. Normally we only have systems without an upper bound of states. You pump in more energy particles get faster. Our dice on the other hand do have an upper bound. The sum . Suddenly you have a high energy state with low entropy. If you put a system of eye sum  together with a system of sum  suddenly its all backwards! Our system with low entropy gives up energy to a higher entropy state. We plug it into our temperature formula and get  negative temperature. This sounds like a weird artefact of the analogy but you can force particles to do the same. The prime example I was told is to orient magnetic particles in a strong magnetic field until they are all in the lazy low energy state of being aligned with the field. Then you freeze the whole thing over so that they cant move and then you flip the magnetic field. All your particles are still in the same state so they have by definition low entropy but they desperately dont want to be misaligned with that magnetic field and search for an excuse to blow their new found energy into your face. Vol system has negative temperature now.,askscience,deouu7g,3,t5_2qm4e11091413,0,t1_denv1ai,The wavefunction squared gives you the probability that when you measure some property of the particle it will have that value. So a wavefunction over space eg xyz gives you the probability of finding the particle in some small volume of space. You can have the wavefunction over different variables like energy momentum or spin. It just gives you the probability to measure that value.Some of these properties will be incompatible though you cant measure momentum while in position basis but you can measure energy while in either.,askscience,dep7a41,1,t5_2qm4e11091765,0,t3_5yda85,Thank you for your submission!

When two connected neurons rarely excite one another the connection is weakened. So lets say for an extremely simple example an observer tries a new strategy to solve a task. The new strategy doesnt work and the observer doesnt try it again. The connection between the neurons which carry information necessary for the observing the task and the neurons for the ineffective response are unlikely to be strengthened.However lets say the observer tries a strategy which is successful. This strategy will be reinforced and repeated. So the connections between the neurons that represent the task and the neurons which represent the rewarded strategy will be strengthened. This in turn makes it easier to activate the rewarded strategy in the right context.In this sense the where is decided. If the rewarded solution was to lift your arm up during the task the connection between observing the task and the location of the moving up arm up neurons is strengthened. This connection sits in the brain and could be considered an engram a physical manifestation of a memory.These connections are called synapses. This process is called Hebbian learning and was apparently first described in  . Of course as always with science the rabbit hole goes deeper and research is goes on to find out more uncover more mechanisms for biological correlates such as long term potentiation LTP of which many are already described and show that it is certainly not the full pictureModulating the strength between connections aka the weights of connections between nodes is also a foundation for artificial neural networks These can be used for AI applications which is awesome again the rabbit whole goes much deeper.There are brain regions specialised for learning certain types of things such as the hippocampus But its important to remember the information which flows into any region and what flows out will also define what will be remembered.edit typo,askscience,deplo1h,6,t5_2qm4e11095742,0,t1_depizpu,If you look at how grainy the footage is my assumption is that OP manually set the ISO really high to get good lighting at night. ,askscience,depoy23,20,t5_2qm4e11095857,0,t3_5ye8cg,removed,askscience,deppeye,1,t5_2qm4e11096230,0,t3_5ygade,Hi colonelcanada thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

You need a very large magnetic field to confine the plasma the energy in the magnetic field is x or more that of the thermal energy of the plasma particles. The confinement geometry needs to be constructed carefully to minimize the magnetohydrodynamic instabilities that can wreck confinement. Fundamentally you also have a hot core plasma and an edge plasma thats much cooler leading inevitably to large temperature gradients across the device. These gradients tend to drive up eddies that cause the core plasma to lose heat quickly. There are various ways to try to tame the instabilities spin the plasma in something called Hmode e.g. or just put the walls farther away and gentle the gradients but they have their own challenges. The larger you make the device e.g. the more difficult the materials science problems become as the heat load on the diverters becomes untenable and disruptions can lead to vast amounts of energy being deposited in the walls of the tokamaks. ITER is almost but not quite too big and too expensive to have even been attempted by humanity. Moreover the focus on ITER within the U.S. funded out of the DOE Office of Science Fusion Energy Sciences over nearly everything else has sucked away most of the oxygen of the RampD scientific enterprise in fusion research. This doesnt bode well for a healthy field going forward we arent training nearly the number of plasma physicists as we used to in MFE because the demand just isnt there. Inertial fusionWe know it works. Experiments in Nevada established the feasibility of inertial fusion. And inertial fusion in the U.S. is funded by the NNSA for national security not energy. Provided it delivers on that mission whether we achieve fusion ignition or not is less important. However to stay within an acceptable cost envelope originally it was scoped to be several times bigger than it was NIF was made too puny at only MJ of laser energy and thus had insufficient engineering margin for achieving ignition given the state of knowledge of the science and maturity of the diagnostics with which to gauge what was going on in the implosions. At present without a major upgrade it doesnt appear to be possible to couple enough energy on NIF with sufficient implosion symmetry to raise the deuteriumtritium fuel to the densities temperatures and areal densities needed for fusion ignition. One of the big efforts in the scientific community is to determine in the next few years why exactly we failed at ignition and what the right path forward is. There are many options none of them cheap and as a community we havent the best track record for trustworthiness. Even if we did have a way to make NIF ignite going to a power plant would require reprated lasers to fire at Hz tracking systems and firing systems to send the hohlraums into the chamber recycling systems to recover the materials probably fissionable blankets to effectively convert neutrons to heat tritium processing systems etc. Engineeringwise its a real mess.

All those oneton projectiles are probably too heavy to lift up into space with existing rocket tech. Once they are up there although they wont have weight per se they still have mass and inertia to overcome in order to move them so you need lots of fuel for the positioningrepositioning thrusters.All that stuff weighs too much to make this a practical endeavor.Maybe if we had a lunar base and could manufacture the oribiters there...I dunno. Even if Lunar One or Maybelline or whatever the base is called had mining operations that would provide the metallic materials youd still need rocket fuel which comes from Earth because all of the varieties I have read about are made from carbon hydrogen nitrogen andor oxygen in varying ratios and sourced from different originsall of which are Earthbound.So maybe a massive heavylift rocket could get an orbital bombardiertype killer satellite up into space...maybe. Once its up there youll have a relatively short lifespan and extremely limited target selection due to finite fuel reserves for orbit maintenance best use of fuel and repositioning worst use of fuel.

The pigment that causes leaves to be green is chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is important for plants to make food using sunlight.  During Spring and Summer when there is plenty of sunlight plants produce a lot of chlorophyll.In Autumn as sunlight decreases and temperatures cool some plants stop producing chlorophyll. Instead those plants break down their chlorophyll into smaller molecules and transfer them out of the leaves before the leaves fall. This molecules are stored elsewhere in the plant until Spring. Then they will use this stored material to rebuild their chlorophyll more easily.Once the plants have broken down the green chlorophyll other pigments in the leaves are revealed e.g.  carotenoids which are yellow and orange. Anthocyanins are other plant pigments that are only produced in the fall. These pigments cause red pink or purple colors.,askscience,df5v08k,8,t5_2qm4e11240274,0,t3_60g16n,Hi Pooch thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

It is at this point of your calculation that the exclusion principle shows up and becomes important because it tells you how electrons will fill up those eigenstates. You can do a simple model calculation yourself Consider a onedimensional well with infinitely high potential walls and length L. Thats one of those textbook Schrdinger equation examples. Compute the eigenstates as a function of length L then fill it up with something like  electrons. Ignore their Coulomb interaction btw. So now your total energy is a function of L and you will see that reducing L will increase the energy i.e. if you want to press on the walls of your well therell be a countering pressure.,askscience,dfba0mh,1,t5_2qm4e11288793,0,t1_dfbjur9,To expand on the first bit the push mechanism is definitely one of the four fundamental forces likely electromagnetism or gravity.

Suppose you have some atom with e in a dshell and another atom with e in its dshell. Because electrons are indistinguishable electrons within a shell can swap around without anyone being able to tell the difference. So if you have e in a shell you can swap them around a bit more because of the extra e  this means that the entropy of this system is slightly higher! And as you might have learned in chemistry higher entropy means more stable.As for why this only happens when you get the dblock it is because entropy scales with the number of states technically the log of number of states. Adding a single electron to  electrons generates more possible states  extra states vs adding an electron to   extra states in the s orbital or   new states in the p orbital and thus more entropy. It is only when you get up to the dblock and higher that this effect starts mattering.,askscience,dfe6xcr,25,t5_2qm4e11313227,0,t1_dfeb9l9,The uncertainty principle.

Its either  To discuss how to promote the status of men in STEM? or To discuss how to promote the status of women in STEM?The first one is a problem because its goal is to improve the status of the majority at the expense of the minority I hope I dont need to lay out why thats a problem. The second is a problem because it creates a platform whereby the majority acts as the gatekeepers for the activity and creates the narrative that only the majority can discuss how the minority can gain status which is lets be honest what  of history has been and that doesnt seem to have worked. It implies that status is given by men to women whom they deem worthy rather than taken by women who earn it. That said Im pretty sure youre not arguing in good faith. The goal of the organization is clearly to work towards a better status for women but the better here means better than it currently is not better than the status of men. Its not as if there arent platforms wherein men and women cant collaborate to discuss this. This does not take away from that.

Laminar flow occurs when there are no forcings that create these sort of gradients not necessarily when fluids move slowly a fluid can be macroscopically static but turbulent because of buoyancy take a cup of warm water and cool its top. Think of the top layer in a lake the only force acting on it is wind which most of the time makes it flow at speeds lower than . ms. Yet the surface layer is completely mixed and turbulent because wind acts just on the uppermost layer causing shear between it and lower layers. When a similar gradient in flow speed forms horizontally then vorticity arises think Couette flow which can be laminar for small cut velocities.Laminar flow means that the gradients in a fluid are small enough to be balanced by viscous forces which limit deformation. When gradients are large and viscosity alone isnt enough to meet continuity or noslip conditions then flow entrains these areas causing vorticity and instabilities which in turn make the flow turbulent. ,askscience,dflrtrg,3,t5_2qm4e11387311,0,t1_dfm4zl9,So the gene flow issue is not a real problem?,askscience,dfmqdqk,2,t5_2qm4e11389746,0,t1_dfmmgyb,So you think every company is greedy by nature?

Is there any onboard fuel source light enough to use for deceleration or are even hbombs so heavy that using them for deceleration and thus accelerating all that fuel is too wasteful and we want to spend all the fuel accelerating and only use interstellar ions solar windsolarphoton sails and gravity maneuvers to slow down?As you said probably star specific a larger star probably gives more options the bigger the gravity well the faster we can be going when we get there.  A smalldwarf star would require us to get below a much smaller escape velocity when we reached the star either severely limiting travel speeds craft size or requiring more onboard fuel sources to manage speed.

Light is given off absorbed by something else and then that gives it off etc. Eventually everything reaches equilibrium once all the things in the room are at the same temperature. Lights still exchanged but theres no meaningful net change. This is how thermal imaging works broadly.Light is one of many ways systems have of exchanging energy  in this case thermal energy. Think of an incandescent light bulb. When its on its so much hotter than the rest of the room that in a net sense it starts giving off tons of light that the room absorbs while absorbing a smaller amount of light energy itself. In fact its light is so high energy that you can see it. When you turn the light off it starts cooling down by continuing to give off light until it reaches the temperature of its surroundings at which point its absorbing the same amount of light energy that its giving off.,askscience,dfyx92a,7,t5_2qm4e11496212,0,t1_dfydeco,I recommend that you look up cavityringdown spectroscopy a very cool technique that relies on ultraefficient mirrors.

Once to the surface and once back.So if you calculate an optical path difference of  wavelength or  whichever you prefer the distance between the reference surface and test surface is some number of discrete waves  . nanometers assuming use of . nm light as test wavelength.TLDR  Interferometers measure very small distances not temperature.

So I will clarify the terminology for you. Im also not really sure what your objection is to what I have written.Extinction is defined in the following manner. Let Zn   of individuals in population at generation n. Let En be the event Zn   i.e. the population is extinct by generation n. Let E be the union of all En which is simply the event that the population goes extinct.Since En is an increasing sequence of nested sets the probability of extinction isgt PE  limngtPEnRecall that pn  probability that a given individual has n successors. So p  probability that an individual has no successors. If p gt  then it is possible the population goes extinct in the first generation because PE  p. Since PEn is an increasing sequence of numbers it follows that PE  p gt . Hence if it is possible to go extinct extinction will occur with some strictly positive probability. But extinction is not necessarily guaranteed because this does not prove that PE  .The extinction time is T and is defined to be the minimum value of n such that Zn  . If the population does not go extinct we say T  . It follows thatgt PT  n  PZn    PEngt PT  n  PEn  PEngt PT lt   PE   limngtPEngt PT      PE    limngtPEngt The thing with breeds I wanted to show is that inf works oddly... I wanted to ask if you have an infinite number of  coin sets and start Gen  on them... How many of these will die out? How many on Gen?So now you are asking about the exact distribution of Zn it seems. Thats a more complicated question but can ultimately be answered by looking at the probability generating function Gz.If we consider the case where a coin that turns up heads is removed and a coin that turns up tails stays put then extinction occurs with probability . Extinction occurs on generation n with probability PT  n  n. For a more general cointossing problem calculating PT  n is much more complicated very likely impossible to get an exact value.If we instead consider the case where a coin that turns up tails has  successors itself plus  more new coins then extinction occurs only with probability PE  .. The exact value is . The probability of extinction in the first few generations aregt PT    .gt PT    .gt PT    .gt PT    .gt Even the concept of smallest chance of extinction breaks down on infinity. Since there is always a N generation which has a smaller chance of extinction.If there would be a smallest number for extinction we could define it and calculate the chance by using that chance for every generation which would lead to something like   pinfBut we have no smallest. The only thing we can say about p that it is very close to  but not I really dont know what this means. Do you understand that PT  n depends on n? The probability of extinction at generation n can be different for each n. Do you understand that we dont need PT  n to be equal to  for all n gt M for some M? That is we dont need it to be impossible to go extinct after some number of generations. Indeed if p gt  then PT  n gt  for all n. That is if there is a positive probability of going extinct in generation  there is a positive probability of going extinct in any generation.,askscience,dg6pob0,2,t5_2qm4e11567941,0,t3_64xl01,removed,askscience,dg78ci8,1,t5_2qm4e11567975,0,t1_dg70abp,JPEG doesnt actually work by throwing away pixels. Instead it breaks down the image into x pixel blocks and then uses a mathematical operation to represent them in terms of patterns of gradients. So it might say this block has an averge color of  with a lefttoright gradient that is  strong and two cycles of a toptobottom gradient that is  strong and  other smaller components. Then it throws away the smaller details rounds the numbers and you end up with average  leftright  topbottomx  which takes fewer bytes to represent than the original though it doesnt quite look the same.This is also why JPEG works great for photos but sucks for text. Photos tend to be smooth and are easy to represent using gradients. Text has sharp edges which get messed up when you represent them with gradients and then throw away information.This is also why if you compress a JPEG at a very low quality you basically end up with a picture of x solid blocks with a few gradients and little color because color is stored separately and tends to get dropped first. Note how all the blocks are either solid or have very simple gradient patterns. Also color is stored at half resolution in x blocks so all the coloring is in x blocks.,askscience,dg78hhr,2,t5_2qm4e11572670,0,t1_dg7qxrc,Its been a long long time since I messed with calculus so forgive me if this is dumb or wrong.But as I recall when you take an integral or derivative of a measure like velocity you end up with something different.

Gasoline engines are very picky about the type of fuel they run on primarily because it has to be resistant to detonation or knocking. Knocking is kind of complicated to explain but the basic idea is that the more something is compressed like in a piston engine the hotter it gets. When the fuel in a gas engine combusts it doesnt all burn instantaneously the flame travels through the combustion chamber burning the gas as it goes you can actually the movement in slowmotion videos. The flame called a flame front pushes the unburned airfuel mixture into a smaller and smaller pocket or bubble compressing and heating it. In certain conditions the unburned airfuel actually gets hot enough that it prematurely detonates before the flame front consumes it causing a large unwanted pressure spike in the engine which you hear as a knocking or pinging sound. There are a few options to prevent this but the best is to have a fuel that has properties that make it resistant to knocking which is what the octane rating for fuels refers to. Regular gasoline has an octane rating of  or so while kerosene has an octane rating of only  so it clearly could not be used in a gasoline engine ethanol on the other hand has an octane rating of  which is why it can be used with very little change to the engine.A gas turbine burns fuel continuously rather than compressing it into a tight chamber and creating a flame front so it doesnt have to worry about knocking. As a result gas turbines can run on a wide range of fuels with minimal design changes. The M Abrams tank uses a gas turbine for its engine and it can run on jet fuel diesel gasoline and a few others.  So in short its not that jet engines cant run on gasoline its that gasoline engines cant run on kerosene. If they chose gasoline airlines would have to compete with every car driver for fuel which would drive up the price for both parties. Kerosene on the other hand doesnt have very much competition so cars stick to gasoline and airplanes stick to kerosene and they dont have to worry about driving the price up on each other.Kerosene also has some other desirable properties like a higher ignition temperature which makes it safer to handle an important consideration for airplanes.,askscience,dg94zrv,8,t5_2qm4e11585453,0,t1_dg8jdnf,Wouldnt material that shifts the polarization of light shift it the other direction though if it were made of antimatter? ,askscience,dg97v62,1,t5_2qm4e11585825,0,t3_65c3ud, Will or wont we evolve backwards since most first world people are spending  of their time in warm officeshomes  not using their spine and legs eatingdrinking pasteurized stuff?

We can use some physical probes in the very very edge near the wall where its much colder and there has recently been some work done to develop really tough probes that can go in a bit deeper but still not that far and you perturb the plasma itself much more with a physical probe so its not a standard measurement.   Lots of diagnostics have ports through the vacuum vessel so they can pretty much have a direct unimpeded view of the plasma.  For example antennas for microwave or radio frequency heating and these antennas can be used as receivers to do to microwave or RF imaging.  I think soft xray measurement devices literally cant even remember what is used for this as well.We do use IR imaging to measure the temperature of the plasma as it hits the wall in some specific spots I think the IR cameras are entirely within the vacuum vessel but not sure.  Some of them do indeed sit behind a window as well and I think the thomson scattering lasers apply here.  If a fusion reactor eventually gets built or for experiments that actually put in DeuteriumTritium all of his gets way more complicated.  Most every diagnostic needs to be outside the vacuum vessel due to the high energy neutron bombardment produced by a thermonuclear plasma.  This basically means a lot of standard diagnostics cant be used at all as the neutrons would destroy them.  So most of the measurements need to be done through special windows and there are all sorts of worries about how to remotely clean them and stuff.  Its some pretty exotic engineering.

It works on exactly the same principle as those waterrepelling coatings you have probably come across but opposite because it is repelling oils. The liquid has no attraction to the surface so it does not spread out but collects together in droplets which then roll off the surface.The coating used on phone screens is Teflon or something similar which is I think unusual in that it is both hydrophobic and lipophobic.

In  crude oil was first applied to the manufacture of kerosene for lighting and heating. Overnight the oil industry was born. Gasoline was a useless byproduct of the kerosene refining process and was often loaded onto ships and dumped out to sea. When automobiles showed up around  Standard Oil campaigned to make sure cheap gasoline found its first reliable market. Cars all ran on kerosene gasoline and ethanol back then. Born a farmer Henry Ford made sure all of his cars could run on ethanol since it was cheap and easy to make on the farm.World War I created the worlds first gasoline shortage in  causing cars to switch to cheaper ethanol. With the War ending in  John D. Rockefeller owner of Standard Oil aka S.O. Esso Exxon lobbied Congress to increase the tax on alcohol to regain gasoline market share but the tax created a black market with farmers which dropped ethanol prices even further. Standard Oil then funded and organized church groups to temporarily give voice to an otherwise ineffective temperance movement while also greasing Congress buying for us in  the th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution also known as Alcohol Prohibition. Henry Ford declared during Prohibition in  that corn alcohol was the fuel of the future. Ford was the last car company to offer kerosene and ethanol adapter kits for all of their cars. Gasoline stations were sufficiently established across America and ethanol fuel sufficiently forgotten that Ford offered only gasoline as a fuel option when their allnew Flathead V engine was introduced during Fords financially troubled year of . On June   just two months after Ford V cars began filling dealership showrooms John D. Rockefeller sent out a press release which started the process of repealing prohibition and in  he bought for us the st Amendment.  The fossil fuel industry considers it a cost of doing business to continue the campaign which assures gasoline will remain the preferred fuel in Otto cycle engines.,askscience,dgc43md,1,t5_2qm4e11612515,0,t3_65n8o6,All radiation can be harmful to us in the right amount. However visible light and lower frequency are only harmful to us in large doses. This includes microwaves infrared and radio waves. These forms of light damage us through heating. For example a laser to the eye or if you put a small animal in a microwave oven. A  W of microwaves directed at a human would be bad as would a  W laser. Both would burn you badly. However a  W light bulb near a person does not have enough visible and IR light to burn you. Nor does the  mW of microwaves radiation coming from your wifi router. With UV and higher frequency even a single photon packet of light can damage us. This includes UV xrays and gamma rays. This is called ionizing radiation and each photon has enough energy to knock an electron off an atom. Knocking an electron off an atom participating in a chemical bond breaks the bond. Destroying bonds in your cells can damage the cell in the short terms radiation poisoning and if the broken bond is in the DNA it can cause mutations and cancer. So  W of visible IR and visible light isnt going to burn you neither will  W of xrays. However  W of xrays will destroy chemical bonds in your body and DNA and is not something you want to routinely be exposed too. Theres also radiation that isnt light based the particles are not photons. This radiation is from other masisve subatomic particles travelling very fast. This is fast moving electrons beta radiation or small atoms helium ions are alpha radiation or protons or neutrons. These arise typically from radioactive elements decaying in addition to gamma ray light. They also come from the sun or we generate them in particle accelerators. These are also ionizing radiation and can strip electrons or even worse like neutron radiation where it can trigger atoms to split like in a nuclear reaction.  ,askscience,dgcaeb9,8,t5_2qm4e11614011,0,t1_dgcg6sf,removed,askscience,dgcgi2d,1,t5_2qm4e11614290,0,t1_dgcbwev,Short answer kinda maybe? Long answer below.To add to above reply. A common mistake made by people is to frame this religion problem as antagonistic against science. While the aspects tend to negatively correlate the factors are not nrcessarily causal. There are many other aspects to religious participation. For example it has been found that economic development tends to have a negative correlation with religious participation. With the limited work that has been done in this subject mostly in the fields of sociology  secularisation thesis mainly  its hard to tell if people are becoming more or less religious. It even goes further to define what being religious is as lots of europeans attend church but they mostly do it for the social network that it provides. Not spiritual reasins. So even the metricchurch attendance being used to measure religiosity is called into question. So the summarised answer is we dont really know. Because if you think about it there a lot of social taboo around the topic  religious organizations around the world would freak out and probably murder the professor who claims that Religion no longer important to society! ,askscience,dgchn4l,5,t5_2qm4e11616575,0,t1_dgcqwag,removed,askscience,dgcqz50,1,t5_2qm4e11617075,0,t3_65sb9i,Hi dougmany thank you for submitting to rAskscience.If your post is not flaired it will not be reviewed.

If this is confusing think of a bathtub with the drain open and the tap on just enough that water drains as fast as it pours into the tub. This is the atmosphere at equilibrium. Now you put something in the drain that impedes but doesnt stop the draining of water  this is the equivalent of a greenhouse gas. Since the rate at which water enters the tub is the same water starts to accumulate in the tub heat builds up in the atmosphere. Here however the analogy starts to break down because increasing the Earths temperature increases the rate at which it radiates energy the equivalent of enlarging the drain so it will reach a new equilibrium but there will be more heat that stays in the system akin to some water remaining in the tub as the enlarging of the drain still only makes it drain water as quickly as water pours in.,askscience,dgt3cb5,1,t5_2qm4e11760731,0,t3_67tdb9,Thank you for your submission!

Impedance matching matters for a receiver but only grossly. Impedance matching networks are only really used on radios that include a transmitter to maximize power transfer between the source and the antenna and to minimize power reflected back into the transmitters final stage. The source you linked says this explicitly on slide four.I dont know of any circuit that automatically tunes antenna impedance without using a transmitter to measure the standing wave ratio to minimize reflected power. It might be possible to tune the impedance of an antenna by measuring the signal strength or the signaltonoise ratio in the receiver after amplification but Ive never seen that done. Its just not worth the effort. Antennas are designed to have about the right impedance over the FM band. Maybe someone will link the schematic for a receiver with no transmitter that includes an automatic antenna tuner. That would be a really neat circuit.I suspect that improvements in radio sensitivity and selectivity mean that its possible to use a worse antenna  a shorter one with a loading coil and a capacitive hat for example. This freedom to use a worse antenna has prompted car designers to pick shorter antennas that look cooler and dont get bent or knocked off as easily. It may also be that people dont listen to the radio as often as they used to so car buyers are less likely to care how well the radio works.,askscience,dgwohhy,2,t5_2qm4e11792716,0,t1_dgwqpdc,removed,askscience,dgwqss2,1,t5_2qm4e11793667,0,t1_dgwtvv5,For any board design over a few ghz its required for consistent dielectric but its costly.
