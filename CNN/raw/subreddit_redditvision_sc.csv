10308590,0,t1_dccgc3l,gtNo famous bandsThis could be a good rule depending on how you define famous.  I agree its kind of cheap to try to enter something by the Beatles or Queen but do bands like Echosmith who have had one song hit the top  and another make top  count as famous? Or in my case Wir sind Helden? Almost nobody in my country has heard of them but theyre very well known in Germany.gtmust be from your countryThis is a good rule in theory but it very unfairly favors countries like the USA and the UK who have a much wider selection of artists to choose from. And would we make exceptions for a country like Luxembourg?gtmust be from I wouldnt want this rule in my own contest but I could be okay with it if it werent too restrictive like within the last year.  In real life Eurovision is a platform for showcasing original music but this doesnt need to become just like Eurovision.gtmust be a national final song that didnt winAgreed. Too specific bad rule.  But for someone who picked a country like Georgia these will pretty much be the only songs theyll be able to find if we use the artist must be from your country rule.gtmust be sung in the mother tongue of your countryThis is a bad rule to use every time but Id actually like to see us try it every once and a while.,redditvision_sc,dccj8wp,1,t5_3i7g1
