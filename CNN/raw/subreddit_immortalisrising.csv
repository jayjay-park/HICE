6529635,0,t3_45283i,not having special right away i thought was a nice change of pace. i easily completed all my bounties. i also saw a much higher kd than my normal pvp kd. i assume this is because people are just trying it and dont realize rushing down the same hallway every time isnt smart. ,immortalisrising,czups3y,1,t5_3bulz

6604130,0,t3_463dl1,I find the more time you play the better you get if sweaty matches are on try and get a spot play skirmish as much as you can and clash but with clash dont worry about kills work on kd and also when you run rumble play for fun hold down a area never get revenge and try not to tilt weapon usage is a big thing use something that kills quick like thorn or last word I hope that helps I have been trying it myself so difficult,immortalisrising,d02f754,1,t5_3bulz

8195714,0,t1_d51wcn1,It kinda depends. I dont really think it makes a big difference with low ROF things like Colovances or Eyasluna as it pertains to the stability. When you fire that slow you have plenty of time to recenter for your next shot. For higher ROF stuff that you might have issues hitting with if they kick too much its something to really think about. I dont know that its really worth it on a shot kill weapon or an NL Shadow.,immortalisrising,d520ls6,1,t5_3bulz
