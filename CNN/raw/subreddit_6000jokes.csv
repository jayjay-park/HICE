I guess itd help to see an example of what format our submissions would look like in the Saturday thread?Will it be five jokes in one post one for each topic? this makes sense to me as it forces us to write for each topic. So itd be the top five jokes as opposed to top five jokes if that makes senseBut do we just pick one of the words from topic ?Or is it just a free for all of jokes that have any of the topics in them if thats the case how many times can we submit?,6000jokes,cenr6b4,2,t5_2znvp
