61584,0,t3_1usj8w,Ive been in the industry for a long time and produced many games that were localized. Typically we do EFIGS English French Italian German amp Spanish as well as Japanese amp Russian. For some reason Korean was never a priority blame the publishers!. Anyhow translators were paid by the word and it was typically paid amp managed by the publisher as part of our publishing contract. On the developers end we were responsible for putting in the hooks and integration. Obvious things to watch out for was avoiding using text in textures and be aware that some languages Im looking at you Russian! can be a lot longer than the English equivalent. Another HUGE thing to consider is cultural sensitivity. You really need people who understand the culture of the language spoken as well as of your game! As an indie and nonindie the decision to localize is largely based on the ROI. Obviously money is usually tight with indies so choose a location that you think will be most popular with your game and crunch the numbers to see if its worth doing. Hope this was helpful. P.S. Im back to being an indie again and I love it!,IndieGaming,celfwgw,1,t5_2r0e3

The animations still appear to require optimization. It looks fairly slow and choppy at points. Dont release a game with gorgeous graphics that runs crappy on my systems. I know from my experience playing Retrovirus that this can result in a great deal of irritation among your players. Its better to dial back the graphics and go for smoother animations if you dont have a large enough team to do the necessary muscle to optimize it for the best performance.,IndieGaming,cffau3w,3,t5_2r0e3

354966,0,t3_1y5ho5,I suspect part of the reason some developers dont always include additional details is so they can avoid being accused of spamming their content.I think its cool that people want to show their stuff off and get feedback. Of course would you like to know more information is helpful and if its in a comment instead of in the title of the post thats fine in my opinion.There was a particular gaming blog that was posting to this subreddit for a while that in every title included their name of the blog. It got downvoted to hell until they stopped doing that. Now I see content from that blog get posted and upvoted based on the content title and link which is the way it should be.Its a hard balance. You want to engage the community but you dont want to annoy them or be accused of spamming.Of course never mistake ignorance for malice. Some people just dont have the experience to know how to promote. Take a positive step why not write an article about how best to discuss their works in progress on Reddit?Getting huffy and demanding that moderators enforce a particular style of posting can lead to resentment and homogenization  not a positive community.,IndieGaming,cfhk4q0,28,t5_2r0e3

810819,0,t3_23feqq,My new release is a arcade match up style game. Its a simple concept where you match the objects coming in from the bottom of the screen to the same object at the top. Features google play achievements amp leaderboards.Since I was always interested in learning Japanese I threw some of that in there too. It features all the words from the jlptn. Changing to the Japanese game mode you will have to match up the kanji to the English word. If there are any mistakes in it and you know Japanese please let me know and I will look into it immediately I was following a website but I could of made a mistake while working on the assets.,IndieGaming,cgwg0b1,2,t5_2r0e3

1121929,0,t1_chvtae3,Should have replied to my original comment as I saw your argument by pure chance gt This sounds a lot like empathy to me.Its great that youve been bonding with your daughter and learning to look at the problems from her perspective it mustve been a great experience. Its too easy to get stuck in that minmaxing mindset and forget the playful approach. However I would argue that approaching problems differently and learning from others isnt empathy. Firstly it is important to note your different backgrounds which were a large factor to your experience not something any other couple of friends can repeat. Secondly that same experience could be had in any other game that requires problem solving no specific design for it required. Whatever you call that experience of yours whether it was empathy or not could be argued but it was thanks to your different backgrounds and not to the games design. You pick up a copy of say Trine  or Portal  and you will have same exact experience from their coop where you and your daughter will approach the problems differently. So my point stands as it wasnt thanks to the games specific design that youve had that experience. ,IndieGaming,chvto5w,1,t5_2r0e3

Thats been considered bad business practice since the beginning of time. Anyone actually doing this doesnt care about our opinions on the matter because they already know what theyre doing is sketchy as fuck and horribly dishonest. Its a good article but its not going to stop developers who do this sort of thing from doing this sort of thing.

1725622,0,t1_cjwo71v,Thanks! That is a good idea. Ill look into it and see if I can add it for the next major update.Once you get into the game it does have a left and top menu. Currently the new league is blank at first but all that space is for new leagues. Some people can have  leagues. Not sure what to put on the left. Edit looking at the game again that is just blank space on the left side not even used for new leagues. This game was a port from a basketball version. Im wondering if he made that page empty in order to get users to focus on the create a league stuff.,IndieGaming,cjwogqd,1,t5_2r0e3

1726926,0,t3_2e7l8v,Played it for about  minutes so these are quite early impressions.The combat is interesting enough for a mobile game and the loot variety is pretty good. Quests seem quite basic in the early game at least forgive me if they get more complex later on.My only real gripe with it is the aesthetic everything just seems so flat and uninteresting theres no depth.  Maybe seeking the help of an avid artist who wants to get hisher art out there could help both of you out.Anyway those are just my thoughts good luck with your game!,IndieGaming,cjwudvs,1,t5_2r0e3

Looks like its back while they take a step back from Mew but theyre also developing a third game which could be anything frankly!Edit and the idea that they might be grabbing some easy money is pretty laughable Eds spoken before about the fact that he can now afford to not worry about money while he makes games.Dont get me wrong Im a little annoyed that Mew isnt gonna come out til next year at least but its become something really exciting and ambitious so who knows how its gonna turn out!,IndieGaming,ck4m5og,13,t5_2r0e3

1822574,0,t1_ck6smag,Hammerfight is amazing! DSwordy is mainly designed with gamepads in mind your right.How is it controlled?We have tried to focus as much on analog input where logical. Left stick to move right stick to lookaim. The triggers directly map to a context sensitive action  when your holding nothing the triggers are for punching if you pull the right trigger slowly  your character will slowing punch with their right arm. If you pull both triggers fast at the same time then youll do a fast two fist punch xD.If your holding a blade weapon triggers are stabbing.If your holding a flail or hammer the trigger is the height held. Fully released  hammer drags along the ground full held down  hammer is held above your head. This helps when your tricky friends are jumping your hammer or flail swings  you can lift it higher etc..Shoulder buttons drop the weapon. If you swing the weapon around and then drop it it will continue its momentum  aka throw! DIts kind of simple to get the basic movement and aiming to start playing competitively but there is a lot of nuance and depth brought in through the analog input personality of the players and interactions of systems with physics D,IndieGaming,ck8t4t3,1,t5_2r0e3

1941157,0,t3_286eg5,People like you MattHoward give the gaming community a bad name. I hate it when people accuse developers of copying other games just because theyre popular which is what youre doing right now. Its the same crap with Call of Duty players. We all know COD isnt unique in any way but people still accuse other games of copying it because theyre popular. Lets really look at this with a clear mind.Yelaxot and Fez are both unoriginal games that look really good. Better than many indie games I can say!Yelaxot and Fez both sold more units than many indie games do. I have talked to Yelaxots developer so I know about its sale. We all know Fez sold a lot so theres no doubt about that.Now lets really get into this. Fez is really a piece of crap that has nothing to offer gamers other than running around and looking at the world. It has puzzles but theyre pretty simple and boring thus not worth mentioning. The only reason Fez is popular is because it was in a damn movie with a bunch of other overrated indie games and the developer Phil Fish is an arrogant douche who knows how to cause controversy. You can tell by the fact that people talk about the movie and Phil Fish being a douche more than the actual damn game. A lot of you people have obviously not played Yelaxot. If you have you would know Yelaxot is actually a pretty damn good game that has challenging puzzles REEEAAAAL GOOD obstacles meaningful NPCs that dont repeat themselves with pointless comments quests that require travelling protecting searching riddles nice graphics which most people who bought and played the game love a longer campaign and last but not least a arcade with playable games like Grand Theft Auto but better.I played through both games so I know what Im talking about here. Aside from the soundtracks you cant even compare Fez to Yelaxot because Yelaxot is by far the better game. You cant even accuse anyone of copying Fezs art style because its just a typical retro style which many indie games have. Speaking of the art style I do believe Yelaxots art style is a bit different. You also cant accuse anyone of copying simple damn assets that MANY MANY MANY games have in them. Especially ones with different styles. The Super Meat Boy accusation saw just floored me. God knows there arent shit ton of games over  years old now with saws in them. As I just read in another comment red striped lighthouses exists in real life. Again I have talked to Yelaxots developer. He is even a better person than Phil Fish. He doesnt throw insults around for now reason and he ACTUALLY thanked me for purchasing his game and playing it. Now with that out of the way how is Fez being copied again Mr.HypeFollower? I called you Mr.HypeFollower because youre just saying this crap because Fez is popular. People stop saying negative things about Yelaxot and actually give it a chance. A game doesnt have to sale over  units to be good. I think Call of Duty Fez Super Meat Boy Candy Crush Saga Flappy Bird Minecraft Terraria and Angry Birds prove that quite well. One more thing. I do remember seeing videos of an old version Yelaxot before Fez was even out. They were deleted unfortunately. So that makes this whole bloody comparison inaccurate! Bluescrn is right anyway. Most of the pictures you have dont even look remotely similar. gtgt ,IndieGaming,ckn3tk9,1,t5_2r0e3

3469678,0,t3_2zz00q,I think this is common reflection in any topic of art when you are a producer of said art unfortunately this is nothing more than a defense mechanism for our own shortcomings.In the art world those without technical talent often run it because it is their only chance of staying relevant. For if the focus was on technical skills and not the abstractism of what is art like in ages past they would be disposable and only true technical skill would be what every gallery sought. AAA games have such a ridiculous amount of work put into them they are hard to compare with indies because the artistic and technical skill put into them are just staggering compared to what an indie dev can ever hope to accomplish by himself. AAA titles would be comparable to Michelangelos paintings purely made for monetary gain but technically fantastic works of art that took a huge amount of work. While Indie games would be something that takes considerably less amount of work. It is here that we see the spill over from the abstract and the IDEA of the game as the real value instead of the purely technical. You mention games that DESPITE being developed for short times are great somehow tying value of quality to games based upon how much quality they produce under a limited time which further muddies your definition of what quality really means. I think we need to define What is gaming? to replace What is art? to come to any sensible conclusion. Anything else will just be personal biased opinions and then we are back with everyone defending their own works of art again by hating on the other side.,IndieGaming,cpnrnyg,4,t5_2r0e3

You need to manage your sound levels and a couple second buffer say showing your studio name or the game name with silence or quiet buildup is preferable to a big blast of sound in the very first second.Didnt even watch the video.  I opened it I was interested but if a company doesnt care enough to manage their audio levels or at least give a volume warning on the link then why should I care enough to check the game out?Seriously guys not just this trailer.

4866986,0,t1_cu7hpxc,IMHO you nailed it with the idea of the Mirrors Prisms Lenses and Dark Matter as tools. The series of screenshots with text that youve got on the Greenlight page to describe them made the gameplay comprehensible so quickly.The  supplied levels the builtin level designer and the mobile tiein seem really brilliant for variety and longevity.I just gave it an upvote on Greenlight and have a suggestionThe  long video takes almost  seconds to show any real gameplaylike behavior. After that the shots show the various tools in action but they lack titling to show their names and explain their role. Also while the style of music seems like a good match for the trailer I found the sounds and the audio mix to be unpleasant almost grating.If you decide to recut the trailer there are several CCbased chiptunes artists out there who might have good wellmixed material for this. Also if you trim some of the time spent on the intro and add some titling to accompany the shots of each tool in action youd be able to build toward showing gameplay and youd have time to show that gameplay for probably  seconds at the end of the video while still keeping the running time to a minute or so.Best of luck!,IndieGaming,cu80rby,1,t5_2r0e3

For example if you were to replace our sun with the nearby star Sirius you might find the weather to be uncomfortable at F C. However if you were to also change the position of the Earth such that it orbited at the same distance as Jupiter this would bring the average global temperature down to a relatively comfortable F .C.As players experiment with different combinations they can observe visual changes to the surface of the Earth as it shifts from a frozen ball of ice to a desert wasteland and everything in between. When players discover new potentially habitable combinations they also unlock educational facts about some of the stars featured in the game including how to find some of them in the night sky.Also for those of the metric persuasion dont worry I have you covered!

This meant releasing  an unfinished Broken Age on Steam for full price letting players buy the first half in order to fund development of the second and forcing fans to wait over a year for the final product.But the Kickstarter backers got both parts for the cost of their Kickstarter investment.

7010408,0,t1_d1ay1nl,His previous article explains it in detail.gt Heres how the scam works  You get a bunch of stolen credit card numbers and then go to a legit Steam key reseller site and use the stolen info to buy the digital codes.  You grab as many codes as you can and then go over to one of these gray market resellers and turn your keys into real money since you bought them with stolen cards.  Meanwhile the website andor developer that you purchased the key from gets a credit card chargeback or other dispute  days later.So essentially its just a way for any regular credit card scammer to turn their stolen cards into cash at the expense of devs and legitimate key selling sites like IndieGameStand.The tool he explains in this article should help devs disable keys that are later found out to be part of this illegitimate transaction. Hopefully when people realize keys purchased from sites like GA are getting disabled they wont buy from there anymore or those sites will have to find a way to combat this.,IndieGaming,d1az5jv,15,t5_2r0e3

I wouldve prefered some directional buttons though. Thats what makes it feel hectic to me. Im constantly moving around my fingers without any breathing room.

7219610,0,t1_d1yn6lp,Great question yellowmr! I believe we are taking some really great features and ideas mixing it all together in to one fun game. Its kind of like how you play the game itself add these things together use this with that and so on to make the creatures we call Gloobs. Were bringing these ideas in from our team members beta testers our fans and other games that inspire us mixing together the best ideas from all of these making sure it works of course. In the end we hope to provide a place for people to lose themselves from  mins to  hours where they can tap into their scientific and creative minds and have a blast experimenting. When it comes to ingame purchases we plan to have some things that are available to players right away to further their experimentation such as  crates of GEL Gloob Experimentation Liquid that is a big part of all the experiments taking place. Beyond that we would like to add some features that are quite different that involve customizing the game to your liking in both look and how you interact with the game. These will be based on community desires and feedback.  But also plainly put what our fans would like to have in the game. For us its not as important that we make tons of money on the game hence why were making it FREE to download and play. Were even putting in a lot of ways for our players to accrue GEL throughout their days of playing to keep on experimenting. Most of all we want this game to be fun for all ages so that we can continue our journey of making games and that youll want to keep playing them. And hey if we make a few bucks from all of this all the better for us to keep doing this well into the future.,IndieGaming,d1ytbwz,2,t5_2r0e3

I eventually worked out the proper hotkeys though rotate being on lt and gt when the arrow keys are used to pan the view is a bit tricky.Most of my discovery of parts and what they could be used for came from looking at other ships and seeing how they functioned.

8366195,0,t3_4u6o17,Some of my favorite platformertype games are N the ninja game Super Meat Boy Broforce...One of N Broforce and SMBs strengths imo is how the camera is zoomed out pretty far far enough that you can see a lot of whats coming next in the level. They use this to great effect at the same time as you are making splitsecond lightning fast movements to avoid obstacles youre also looking ahead at the next few jumps or enemies and trying to plan out how youre going to proceed to that next part. Having safe areas to stop for a second and catch your breath after a particularly hard part is nice too.This is a pretty big contrast to older platformer games I also grew up liking like Donkey Kong Country Mario Yoshis Island where pretty much all you can see is the next jump ahead of you and you tackle obstacles essentially one at a time. Theres almost never a sense of seeing an objective meat girl the flagpole a powerup etc. and having to think about a manystage route to get there.If its an action platformer I think Broforce is a great model to look to. Each level can be completed in many many ways you could climb a wall to get to a high part of the terrain and take a huge jump you could blast your way through a wall you can charge blindly ahead or slowly and methodically work your way through enemies. For me this was more interesting than plaftormers where all you do is... jump across platforms. But its also much much harder level design I bet.If you want weapons Intrusion and Intrusion  arent exactly platformers more like Metal Slug with a bigger emphasis on jumping and vertical levels has some nice examples imo. The enemies ragdoll when they die so when you get a super powerful weapon like the laser beam that absolutely blasts them back and they fly across the screen to smack into the wall thats super satisfying. But N and SMB are both great examples where the enemies are more stage hazards than something to run and gun.IDK just some thoughts of mine.,IndieGaming,d5nbqjy,6,t5_2r0e3

8419756,0,t3_4uhu9n,Project Title Mechanical GenocidePromotion Type AwarenessFeedbackNameRole  Seb k Project lead and programmerLink  DescriptionMechanical Genocide is a vehicular combat game that takes place in a postapocalyptic setting. The game is mainly about small online matchmaking skirmishes mostly involved with  v  battles. We are thinking about  v  but not  sure. The basic idea is that the players must utilize their vehicles build and knowledge of map as best they can to achieve victory skill may also be a factor as well. Vehicles are equipped with three weapons a gimbaled front weapon a fixed front weapon and a rear fixed weapon. Vehicles also have an active system to use such as an armor repair boost or cloaking and a deployable structure from offensive to supportive towers.The game is in very very early stages of development and there are bound to be bugs and issues though hopefully not big ones.

Some comments  it took me a while to realize I could use WASD ... was jumping between my trackpad and the arrow keys frantically gtlt  it might be better just to let the cursorthingy continue moving when holding down a key the getting stuck in at the      positions gets annoying gt feels like holding the key should let you continue moving in the same direction without having to switch gt but it eventually became natural you might want to add some text like gt click the orbs with an arrow instead of the mouse symbol over the orb gt it took me a minute to figure out gt other users might not have the patience background music could be more relaxing gt tho I like the orb sounds  I dont know if Id play much longer gt the prototype was satisfying enough and it feels like it would get boring if I played much longer  it is already a solid mini type game and I felt a solid sense of accomplishment after the final level  you should be proud gt this is a great prototype and is well polished,IndieGaming,dgmrxdc,6,t5_2r0e3

11727612,0,t1_dgoax2d,gt We added support for WASD pretty recently after some other feedbacks and there is indeed no clue beside pause menu that it can be used instead of the arrows an additional issue being that we also support ZQSD and there are still some other layouts. Ill consider a way to let the player know those keys can be used.gt Regarding the controls it has been ont of the toughest questions until now in fact we did try what you suggest it solves some issues and raises others like for exemple if you start at the bottom of a wave go to the top with the right arrow then quickly release it and press it again you change direction with the same key it can be confusing. For now we mainly hope that the player gets used to the controls as you did since on the long run we think its the more efficient scheme. Maybe in the end we will let the player chose its favorite scheme in the options.It is just the transition at those noted positions still felt awkward even when I had a solid grasp of the controls.gt We try as much as possible not to put any ingame text beside the warning that its a prototype but we might rework the mouse icon if it isnt clear enough at first you didnt understand it was a mouse or you got that but didnt think about clicking on the orb?I didnt think about clicking the orb. Perhaps you can use the more touch screeny indicator of a pointer hand pressing down on the orb versus just hovering the mouse symbol over the orb? the mouse symbol seems fine after revisiting the game but obviously this is meaningless since I already knew what it meant nowgt I totally get your point about the game becoming boring. We aim to add some kind of emergent story in the full game in order to maintain the players curiosity up and bring some distraction from the puzzles but were not absolutely sure about how were gonna do that yet . I found it fun! With a lot of puzzle games the major issue I find is that they try to make the game longer by using the same mechanisms and increasing difficult gt which just seems to be a recipe for user frustrationboredom gt Im more willing to stick with games that dont get too hard and add funnovelunique mechanisms for solving puzzles.gt Would you be able to describe why it wasnt as relaxing as we wanted it to be?I liked the ambient sounds gt seagulls and waves. But the electronica ambient music just felt scratchy? gt Almost forgot beside the music did you find the overally experience relaxing? Or were the puzzle too hardfrustrating?I found it fun and not too stressful.  The puzzles were fair and challenging enough! A solid balance. My main anxiety stemmed from having to juggle the keysclicking with the trackpad!,IndieGaming,dgpcsvr,1,t5_2r0e3
