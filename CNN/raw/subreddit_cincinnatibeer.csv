2923248,0,t1_cnylz5x,It really is an improvement on the original.  The citrus taste is very pleasant not overpowering and nice tart finish.  The Ambers was less impressive.  The ginger just overwhelmed everything.  The Prowler with Coffee is outstanding.  Also have to give a thumbsup to their Zoetic Citra Pale Ale.  I got a howler and it was a very nice to finish off over board games with the family.,cincinnatibeer,co0dru0,1,t5_2wz80

6639131,0,t1_d05ywgo,I guess the fact that they brew their beer locally and hire local talent to work at the brewery has nothing to do with being a local brewery.  Right. Got it.,cincinnatibeer,d061kqx,1,t5_2wz80
6749917,0,t3_485ti8,People here are suggesting Tafts and theyre right. Their Maverick is one of the best chocolate stouts Ive had. Also look into Triple Digit which only makes high gravity beers.,cincinnatibeer,d0hhxxj,1,t5_2wz80
7336887,0,t1_d28yz46,I didnt have that great of an experience. I went in the middle of March soon after they opened. I figured there would be some kinks that needed to be ironed out. The only place I could find a tap list was on Facebook which turned out to be outdated. The single beer bottlecan selection was huge but very expensive. I think it was high priced because you could drink them inside the bar rather than bringing them home. The neat growlers were also extremely expensive The bar had a pretty cool atmosphere though. Great beer selection. People seemed to be nice. I may give it another try.,cincinnatibeer,d2c5jih,1,t5_2wz80
