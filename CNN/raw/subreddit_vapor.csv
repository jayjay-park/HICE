You want a lot of air flow for clouds and both of those have plenty. I also hear good things about the Dotmod Petri v but I personally havent tested it yet.But I think its more down to your build and what wattage you vape at those are gonna be the biggest factors for clouds.,vapor,d4zwr2q,1,t5_2swd2
