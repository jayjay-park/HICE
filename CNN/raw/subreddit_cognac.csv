3770013,0,t1_cqm07gu,It was a surprise to me as well. I thought Id end up on the floor in pain writhing about surrounded by an old house and servants. Yet it was quite nice and smooth.Granted its a brandy that has been aged for  years in the Brandy capital of Russia. So thats close to an XO. Assuming it takes a little longer in Russia due to climate differences from the Cognac region its at least a VSOP which typically are pretty tasty.,cognac,cqm0c3h,1,t5_2sdhj
4404040,0,t1_coqd7pf,Good review. I had this last night.  I think it is a good all rounder without being mind blowing.   Ie. have it in the cupboard for friends.I cant really comment on your tasting notes I dont think my palate is advanced enough. Less floral than Remy Martin certainly.,cognac,csm2jde,2,t5_2sdhj
4563083,0,t1_ct5s2q3,I definitely understand what you mean.  On my review I could not taste specifically the roses on this specific occasion under which I wrote the review but I could smell it at chin level and in the empties.  The taste was just floral.,cognac,ct5sj1b,1,t5_2sdhj

I would also recommend various armagnacs.,cognac,d226f63,3,t5_2sdhj

10269738,0,t1_dc80v40,Interesting.  What else do you drink?  For my tastes my preferences are flipped and Im not a fan of the Delord.  The Delord is certainly richer and sweeter but because its almost certainly flavored and colored.Glad you like it though!,cognac,dc84q7b,1,t5_2sdhj
