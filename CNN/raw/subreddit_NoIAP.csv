Hearthstone is pulling in millions a month.Not every indie will have the money needed to make a massive competitive game that is Art heavy...Simply making something that is  as good is not a real metric.I know what youre saying though but if Hearthstone was made by a smaller indie company without the backing of a AAA game company my bet is you would never had played it at all. Even if it was  as good as what it is now...gt  the underground revenue can just be extra income.I think this is what the Underground intended for the developers just extra cash. But when I browse some of the dev groups I am in you will see many devs thinking its the only good model etc... not the best perspective!Overall I actually like the Underground concept and might give it a try.,NoIAP,cuh9s88,1,t5_39ia3
5016108,0,t3_3jn5gb,Hi guys just found this reddit and like it.  Wanted to showcase my new game ... Demons Rise.  Its kind of like a fantasy version of XCOM.  Turnbased strategic RPG with cover and morale like the original s era XCOM title but with heavy doses of classic DampD.  Was rated    stars from Touch Arcade just this week.  Let me know what you think.,NoIAP,cuqmqhy,1,t5_39ia3
