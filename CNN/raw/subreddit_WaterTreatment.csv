5202046,0,t1_cvcr3vc,Thats a good question. Any company that knowingly sells you a water treatment system that cant be serviced by any other company but them is predatory. Finding parts for these machines online for DIY repairs or just to save money is impossible. Most of these companies also severly undersize treatment equipment. They also promise to take care of problems with your water but with the system being undersized or not properly applied to the chemistry of your water they fail miserably. Also the prices of most if not all of those companies listed are ridiculous. Ive seen people in my area pay  for a small water softener. The APR if you finance with these companies can also be up to  even if you have decent credit. Its very sad. And those companies listed are all guilty of it. ,WaterTreatment,cvd1fub,2,t5_36wnj
