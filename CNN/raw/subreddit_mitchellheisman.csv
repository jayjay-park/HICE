9549637,0,t1_d9q6648,I imagine Mitchell laughing his ass off writing certain paragraphs with how scathing his sarcasm is. And then I think about the deep despair that must come from reflecting on how most people wont even be aware of the joke in the first place since the dominant strategy is to not think about the ideas he presents.Im sad that the note is so long because its hard to encourage other people to give it a chance. If hes correct about some of the things he talks about happening in the future then maybe the note will get more mainstream attention.,mitchellheisman,d9q6up8,3,t5_2v5r0
