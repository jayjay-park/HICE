6622682,0,t1_d04c3ej,gtI think that to many people the biggest threshold to bring your kid to the doctor is the fact that you need to make time for it.Well if your kid is sick you need to make arrangements anyway if they cant go to school you need to take a day off or ask family to babysit. That means there is time.I think in quite a lot more cases its laziness andor fear of going to the doctor for nothing. But whatever the reason I agree that its not the fee thats the threshold.The fee definitely never stopped us from not taking chances with our kids even back when we only had one income. Hell right now Im paying two mortgages and we dont take any risk with our kids...,belgiek,d04cbx2,3,t5_3cb04
