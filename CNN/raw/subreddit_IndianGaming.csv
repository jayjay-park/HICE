8678934,0,t1_d6qfdw0,Bro I said . Technically on DX its   but on DX it easily touches a  margin.Sure you can say that Nvidia cards are more sound thermally but thats the price you pay in my eyes you know? You get  of a  perf with a hotter card but for a really less price.Im sorry I didnt mean to use the OC figures literally i just meant to say Nvidia clocks can go up  mhz and give you an increase which AMD gets with varying offset quite low than  mhz.Its sad your AMD cards died like that because I have a really opposite experience I got my iMac w HDM in  and it has served me well with zero problems albeit they throttle but cant blame the card for the form factor. which is OCed to the max since the last . yearsI mean I have nothing against Nvidia I have an uncle who worked at the Bangalore office but I just cant recommend a  with good conscience to anyone except a Nvidia fan compared to something like an gig RX  they just made the near perfect minus the thermals and OC potentials which is given by design budget GPU for the masses. Dont forget  was partially a response of sorts to  so if the  didnt exist Nvidia wouldnt feel the need at all to release a  and everyone would have to minimum look at a  if they even WANTED a Nvidia GPU.AMD at the moment is doing WAY more for budget gamers than Nvidia IMO and thats where my base preference for AMD at that budget comes from.,IndianGaming,d6qho16,2,t5_2tn4t
