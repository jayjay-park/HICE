9803298,0,t1_dakr1av,Exactly this. Thanks. Ill keep reading. Just one Last question. I cant seem to find how to connect the java app to the database in a client like fashion. The java  stuff  ive read in the firebase page talk about the  backend. Like its only one main java server. Should I connect the java app with an http request? As in create the json file and send it?
