6670651,0,t1_d08lpfd,Structural engineering has more interplay with other fields like architecture and construction so its more convenient to be in a city because youll regularly have meetings with your clients. I would think being close to your work would be more beneficial in waste water treatment or geotechnical engineering. I do some site inspection for my job as well but only for projects we have in our city.,StructuralEngineering,d09awrc,1,t5_2ttcu

7637567,0,t3_4jobk0,I lold so hard when I heard  pounds per square foot. Also I was skeptical when I heard it is cantilevered on one side but the span isnt too bad  ft and an  thick slab is a gratuitous amount of concrete and no.  bars at  OC each way is a gratuitous amount of reinforcement. I cant run calcs on that but it sounds plenty fine listed are the things I would definitely consider as very important make certain the concrete is airentrained probably roughly  to allow for freezethaw cycles especially being as exposed as it is.  I would hesitate to use fiber we dont permit fiber on exposed concrete slab because it makes the job of finishing it very difficult. it does help mitigate cracks but if you have rebar  O.C. that should help much more with cracks. If youre going to cover the concrete with another finish it would probably be fine but if not dont worry about it. I would go with  psf snow max in Colorado per the most recent building code  psf live load for people and then  psf due to the weight of the slab. so  total including self weight And that  psf live load is being extremely conservative as I believe the minimum the building code provides is  psf which is a stretch make certain the reinforcement is located  from the bottom of the slab for clear cover. Otherwise if the bottom of the slab cracks not a lot mind you but its extremely common for slabs to form hairline cracks so that the reinforcement can receive the tensile loads water might seep up and start to rust the reinforcement. But make certain the reinforcement isnt above halfway in the slab.,StructuralEngineering,d3ack3y,1,t5_2ttcu

8125362,0,t3_4qillx,This will depend on the laws  legislation in your jurisdiction. In NZ consulting engineering firms will have a professional indemnity insurance package for their area of practice. This will cover claims made by the client or local body in the event of things going wrong.You do not seem to have this protection if I was on your position I would be reluctant to get involved unless I was working on behalf of an engineering firm.,StructuralEngineering,d4td3tj,2,t5_2ttcu
9032614,0,t1_d7xinj8,You need to hire a professional structural engineer for this especially one who is knowledgeable about local building practices if this building was not built in conformance with any kind of building code. There is a ton of more information that is needed to even begin to look at this and give you any kind of definitive answer measurements more photos a full drawing set including structural drawings which show the framing system member sizes connections etc. a site visit. Most structural systems are mostly hidden once buildings have been finished and so it is difficult to know for sure anything about it without drawings or unless they have been constructed in a typical way.People online could look at  photo and your  drawing which is completely unhelpful without more context and guess but do you really want to take a complete guess when you are asking if something is safe?,StructuralEngineering,d7xksfu,3,t5_2ttcu
