388360,0,t1_cfktagu,I also agree with Heroes v Monsters as an experienced player. Both are pretty balanced with each other and also play a very aggressive strategy of playing monsters or heroes and beating face with them. There is still some skill and thinking how to best go about that and how to answer your opponents threats but the overall strategy is simple enough for new players to gain the basics of the game. Plus it has some very good cards that can be used if pursuing older formats or casual ones. ,NewToMTG,cfl0p8c,2,t5_30hu4
403625,0,t3_1yol1j,What Ive done in my last few days is picked a mechanic I wanted to explore. Ive been working on a RW Heroic deck with instants for buffs and to activate Heroic. The deck came down to about  bucks once I took out the really expensive cards and replaced them for a little worse counterparts. Anyway I think your best bet to build is to pick a mechanic my best friend runs a flash deck. Magic to me is unlike other card games in the sense that tiers are pretty arbitrary. Yeah the best decks will win more than they lose but it isnt unheard of to get manascrewed or flood and not be able to make a play while a lowertier deck gets off all its combos. A cheap deck isnt a bad deck its just a less efficient deck. I think your best bet might be to try to get an Event Deck from any of the current sets that are in. For like  dollars itll set you up with a complete  card deck plus sideboard and then from there you can change it in and out as you so choose with cards you think might fit better etc. Hope this helps!,NewToMTG,cfmlol7,4,t5_30hu4
412610,0,t3_1yngql,Dragon Shields are definitely the best and KMC Mattes are similarly high quality. Although Dragon Shields are going to be a little pricier they will also be good for much longer than Ultra Pros. Ultra Pros start breaking after a day of playing. Dragon Shields will literally last years. The only negative to Shields is they tend to pick up a lot of gunk. This might just be because they are good for longer might be how they are made. Youll probably find yourself grabbing a hard flat edge Hard plastic card cases are great for this and scraping the icky crud off your sleeves periodically. ,NewToMTG,cfnj71y,2,t5_30hu4
