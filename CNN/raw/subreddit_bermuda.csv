4537119,0,t1_ct2hqco,Thanks and sorry havent had much time to explore other posts here yet but am now seeing many great tips! Ive seen many videos of cliff jumping in Bermuda and have done a fair amount of it around where I live so if anyone knows any good spots for that thatd be great. Also just looking for some not so populated touristy scenic areas i.e. good places for Sunrisessunsets hiking etc.Again trying to do as much as possible so if there is just anything that hasnt been covered in this sub that anyone can think of as a must do please share! Thanks! ,bermuda,ct2j9si,1,t5_2r94c

When the season hits cup match you are guaranteed to see all sorts of action going on.Other then that how was your stay??,bermuda,d3v7bja,2,t5_2r94c
