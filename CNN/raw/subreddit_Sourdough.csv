841004,0,t3_23rka4,This may be useful to you General Information on Sourdough Starter Culture ResourcesCheck out the Starter Culture Resources on how to create and maintain your own starter. You can apply multiple methods to achieve satisfactory results so dont fret if the information therein contradict each other. Also the terms starter and sponge refers to separate things. Mother dough chef preferment poolish biga and so on all overlap but arent equally the same. A bakers glossary such as this one by King Arthur Bakery will be great use to you.If you dont intend to bake sourdough every day its acceptable to chill your sourdough starter in the fridge. It basically delays the metabolism of the microorganisms in your starter. Otherwise if left out at room temperature without enough feedings the micro bugs in your starter will starve and completely change the characteristics of your starter often for the worst e.g. will not leaven your dough properly andor produce off flavours.,Sourdough,cgzvi1r,2,t5_2s7wc

I then reduce heat to about F remove the lid and leave it in until it starts to flirt with burnt.    its easier to under cook bread than it is to over cook. if you think your loaf is done leave it alone for another  minutes.,Sourdough,ciw1jfp,3,t5_2s7wc

3838987,0,t1_cqtvdzl,Actually if you work in Bakers Percentages you can just change the recipe.  Effectually youll just be replacing the water in the recipe with your starter I like to use a weight of starter equal to  of the total flour weight as a good guideline or adding more flour to the recipe to get that pancake consistency.I have a soggy high hydration starter fed  flour  sugar and  water and Ive got a stiff low hydration starter actually its reserved dough from the previous batch at approximately  hydration.  The yeast produce different flavors because of  what I feed them and  the consistency of the starter.  If you really like the profile of your starter just know that changing what you feed it and how thick it is will change the flavors.,Sourdough,cqtvm7c,1,t5_2s7wc

5777861,0,t1_cxd9jb9,To elaborate most people rise their bread in a place that is warm. If they dont have a place that works to rise bread they will often create one in order to rise their bread.

6010355,0,t3_3xrky5,Are you weighing your waterflour feed ratio? The thickness should never exceed what youd feel if you just mixed  by mass flour and water and mixed it together. It will only get thinner than that as time goes on. Smelling like alcohol is fine  thats a byproduct of the yeasts metabolism. Id go ahead and bake with it if you get consistent rise out of it. If its bad it will smell like its rotting and maybe exhibit a change in color.,Sourdough,cy7hky8,1,t5_2s7wc

6222187,0,t3_403n4u,It depends how many times the dough will ferment before baking. With recipes that require a biga or a sponge soaked over night Ill use a settled starter sometimes even an unfed starter right out of the refrigerator  its just going to referment with all of the added flour and water anyways. If its a recipe where the dough only proofs once before going in the oven Ill be sure to feed my starter about  hours before hand. ,Sourdough,cyww8om,1,t5_2s7wc
6267942,0,t1_cz1wme6,Probably under proofed.

8759878,0,t1_d70m3wl,My tablespoon of starter weighs around g so I feed with g of water and g of flour. But yes something like  tbsp each of water and flour and leave it in counter top. Once I notice it doubled or is bubbly I feed it again. If it doubles in less than  hours I just proceed with the recipe. If not I feed it again. I do it because I use a small quantity when making bread usually around g. When I use more then Ill feed what I have in my jar and take out a bit and feed it until its active and bubbly.No I dont keep it counter top all the time because the weather here can get pretty warm during the day and very cold at night which isnt really health for the starter and keeping on countertop means regular feedings so it wont starve to death. I keep it in the fridge to make it slower and last longer. And yes you do need to actively feed it even more your starter is young and never was fed so there is no really certainty that you did have a health starter and it was ready to be used. I remember when I made my second starter the first one died after getting contaminated with harmful bacteria I mixed equal parts of water and flour let it sit for  days stirring at least twice everyday then fed it once per day until it was active enough to double in less than  hours in room temp.I suggest you to start again from zero following a guide. A good guide is this one  Its recommended the starter be in room temperature before using because when its cold its activity is slower and can result in a slower fermentation resulting a longer time total in making the bread. If you use cold water or any cold ingredients it will take longer for the dough to reach the room temperature thus longer time fermenting and so on. But the problem of your loaf may be in your starter since it wasnt really a starter because you never fed it and watched it to see if there was indeed some activity going on. This is why I suggested you to start over again so you can be sure you do have a starter with wild yeast on it.EDIT Forgot to mention if your starter shows any fluid on the top stir it and feed it. Its a common signal its starting to starve so it switched their fermentation to survive yeast can do  types of fermentation anaerobic and aerobic respiration. The fermentation sourdough bread benefits of is the aerobic one while the anaerobic is usually done when there isnt enough food or oxygen so it produces alcohol andor lactic acid which is the liquid at top.  ,Sourdough,d70n8ft,2,t5_2s7wc
8995748,0,t3_51bmul,i started out with the  whole wheat recipe in Josey Baker Bread  it was delicious but the crumb was pretty dense.

9036432,0,t3_53zbl3,Havent read through all the comments but I have two pieces of advice. First try the following. g starter dissolved in g water then add g flour. Allow to ferment for  hours then feed again or refrigerate.  This is a good starting place. Second if youre not seeing any activity either start over or get a starter from someone else that is active. Using rye flour at the start or at any point in the process is good for getting things going add it has a lot of natural yeast compared to wheat flour. If youd like any further clarification or tips let me know. ,Sourdough,d7y1b0d,2,t5_2s7wc
9137275,0,t1_d8a6gcs,Honestly Ive never had good results with a Dutch oven. Im not sure why they just never turn out. As for temp Im not sure. Both have a bake time of  minutes so Im not sure how both breads would come out okay. It seems like a lot of people on here make high hydration doughs so maybe higher temps are good for helping them to dry out a bit. Im really not sure I mostly like to work with a firmer dough. Personally I dont like to go above  when baking in a loaf pan. The bottom crust tends to burn if I let it go higher. With experimentation Ive found that  is just about perfect but that may just be my shitty oven. Mastering the slash is hard. I get best results with a super sharp wet chef knife. You have a lot more blade working through the dough so the cut can be deep enough to let the dough spring nicely in the oven. ,Sourdough,d8a7scd,1,t5_2s7wc

9363351,0,t1_d92u83f,I mean you can use a knife but a razor will have a lot less drag. If youre retarding your dough it should score very easily either way. Dipping your knife in water helps keep it from sticking too.To get a good ear you need to cut flatter into the dough more parallel to the ground. You dont need to cut too deep maybe  of an inch. It will expand with the oven spring. ,Sourdough,d92ve9n,1,t5_2s7wc

10803115,0,t1_ddu7ga3,When i feed my starter that I wont need for a while I do  grams of each.  I scale up a day or two before I am gonna bake.  Dont waste your flour if you know you will throw it out.,Sourdough,ddu9jyu,1,t5_2s7wc
10812083,0,t3_5uio8p,Stick with the rye flour for the starter. If anything go with a  mix of it and your KA flour. Also when you say filtered are you saying filtered tap water or bottled water? Your starter will go through many stages before its right and some of those might not be very active. Just keep with the feedings and whatnot and you should eventually get a happy starter. Personally I only do one feeding a day and that works for me. Once I get into higher baking production Ill probably switch but I just dont bake enough that I need a super active starter going all week.,Sourdough,ddv6unf,2,t5_2s7wc
