8294936,0,t1_d5d77jh,Hmm heres my breakdown of some of some high schools reputations based PURELY on my own experience now nearly  years ago. Ill have a chat to Mum and Dad re primary schools too and get back to you with what they reckon.St. Edmunds Christian Brothers College single sex boys high school  Diverse education including a strong focus on arts social justice and socialemotional development as well as academia sport and leadership also a strong school based tradeapprenticeships program. Im pretty biased in favour of my old high school had a fantastic  years here. Not sure about much in the way of school fees etc however I understand them to be reasonable within the spectrum of private schools.St. Marys Catholic Girls College single sex girls high school  Sister school paired with St Eddies located across the road. Similar valuesfocus as described above I think fees might be a little bit cheaper than St. Edmunds.St. Peter Claver College  Coed high school with an extremely diverse ethnic mix in their community. Strong focus on cultural diversity social justice. Fees on par with St. Edmunds and St. Marys I believe. Ipswich BoysGirls Grammar Schools  Pricey! High quality academic education high quality sporting programs lots of affluent and influential exstudents and donor families. West Moreton Anglican College  Pricey again! Bit of a wider focus of dance music and arts than the grammar schools pretty strong academic performer strong focus on agriculture outdoor education type endeavours also.Westside Christian College  Cant tell you much about this school sorry. I knew a few people who went here all had pretty good things to say about it all turned out to be pretty nice people too.Bremer State High School  This high school has a pretty nasty reputation Id say a lot due to its OLD campus which was pretty awful. The new school is actually pretty impressive and knowing a few teachers up there has some really solid programs for kids with learning disabilities behavioural disturbances. Pretty diverse cultural community at Bremer however Im not too sure if its celebrated and promoted in the same way that it might be at Peter Claver.Ipswich State High School  Ippy State High doesnt have a great reputation unfortunately. I havent had much to do with it really however some of my best friends went to school here and theyre all great people with good jobs stable lives etc. However most of them unanimously say that they had a pretty ordinary high school experience.,ipswich,d5efc79,2,t5_2s7ae
