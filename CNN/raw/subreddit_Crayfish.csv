636515,0,t1_cedblsl,C. Diogenes I bet. I catch them in Southern Illinois out of my yard. Have about  holes in my yard one night I shined a flashlight in one and saw claws. I dont know what I expected but it wasnt that. After that I got a bit obsessed and finally perfected a way to catch them using a hot dog on a string pliers and a big spoon to block their escape. Probably caught  or  by now. ,Crayfish,cgcmeor,2,t5_2w6dr

1897742,0,t3_2gch6w,Yes it is improper naming because thats how the pet trade works. They sell species without having any knowledge of what they are regardless of the risks associated with them disease invasion etc..You probably have something like Cherax peknyi but itd be hard to say anything further without a photo first.  gallons should be plenty however. If dried blood worms work then great. I have found that they make a mess and are not usually eaten. Frozen bloodworms work better. You can feed algae wafers fish food carrots peas zucchini etc. They are hardly picky.Keep in mind that you will likely need a heater for this particular crayfish if it does end up being something similar to what I mentioned above.Ill be happy to help more just need to see the crayfish first.,Crayfish,ckhv936,3,t5_2w6dr

4322636,0,t3_3ai46r,Well if you get enough males and females theyll breed like cockroaches under the right conditions. Theyre most definitely not sterile. Its not cost effective to sterilize them before selling to market. If youre thinking about putting them in your back yard pond keep in mind they do land travel. And once they start breeding can become invasive if theyre not native to your area.,Crayfish,cscw1so,3,t5_2w6dr
4682951,0,t3_3f1m0j,Actually i am sorry to say you are all wrong. That is Rodger. Rodger the crayfish used to live in a small eddie in the southernmost area of the mississippi. Well that was until he was captured and sold at petco. ,Crayfish,ctktyr0,1,t5_2w6dr
4944778,0,t1_cuhpqxw,Oh as for catching a cray. Gently turnlift a rock. Always move the rock with the current if you can but gentle is the real key. You dont want to kick up a lot of slit. If you do this gentle enough you might find a cray calming sitting on the bottom. Easiest thing to do is put a cup behind them and scare them with your free hand but scoopinggrabbing isnt too hard. They can move father and faster than you expect when the flick their tails especially the little ones. When you pick up the rock keep an eye out for escaping crays. In general Id say wear some polarized sunglasses. I have yellow fishing glasses that just cut right through the water. Makes spottingtracking craysfish much easier.Lastly return the rock as close to its previous position as possible so the next cray can use it as a home .PS an escaping cray usually goes for another rock but Ive also seen them quickly dig down into soft mud. Really cool the first time I saw it happen. If I didnt see him digging Id never have found him again.,Crayfish,cuhtuvh,1,t5_2w6dr
5113056,0,t1_cv2b2u8,Dr claw is in a  as well as for the type umm...  Not sure lol. I have a main tank and I know all of them but the  in this one not too sure what they are. My wife bought them after the local pet store guy recommended them as playing well with crayfish. Edit here is a pic of them ,Crayfish,cv2bbui,3,t5_2w6dr
5653237,0,t3_3sjrhb,If he doesnt have an air bubblestonefilter he needs some sort of climbout so he can airbreathe if the oxygen levels in the water get too low. A branch or rock is fine for this and it doesnt actually have to exit the water but should be high enough that if hes standing on it he can get his back out thats how Ive always done it anyway.  Longterm youll definitely need either a filter or an air stone I love sponge filters easy to make! but it sounds like youve got a plan for that.,Crayfish,cwxu87e,2,t5_2w6dr
5836281,0,t3_3v5zxk,I know it is going to sound weird but all of my crayfish that Ive ever had were all hippies.  I even got one from my sister in law that murdered everything in the tank she bought a big tadpole and it cut it in half within a few minutes of being in the tank.  She gave it to me I put feeders in there and it killed no one for months before I got rid of it.  ,Crayfish,cxknw9h,2,t5_2w6dr
7987036,0,t1_d436jvt,You are right. Pest snails are only a problem if theres excess food for them to thrive in. I was in the same situation and even resorted to try and kill them every time i saw them but it was a war i was not going to win. After a couple of months the only thing that helped out was feeding less and actually just feeding enough for the fish to eat. Small feeding times  times a day instead of just  big meal. That way the food doesnt sit there forever.,Crayfish,d4dtho9,3,t5_2w6dr

9102867,0,t1_d85yr9f,Itll be quite the recovery good luck. Lost an eye too?Make sure the cover is done in a way she cant get wedged funnily. How on earth does she move?,Crayfish,d860ohx,1,t5_2w6dr
9285276,0,t1_d8rry55,This is a terrible answer but you just want the water to be hard not soft. Im not well versed in the chemistry of it but you need enough calcium carbonate in the water so that the crayfish can recalcify after a molt. For the sake of your aquarium Id treat it as a presence absence. Dont worry about the exact ppm because the test kits will differ in their levels of resolution just make sure its towards the high end not low end of the scale.,Crayfish,d8sz561,3,t5_2w6dr
