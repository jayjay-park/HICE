5484343,0,t3_3q4qp1,There is a book called The End of my Addiction by Dr Olivier Ameisen which I highly recommendAlso available electronically on Apple and elsewhere. If you want to take this further it is a must read.There were others before him but he basically discovered that baclofen used mainly for the suppression of muscle spasms in various ailments has the effect when taken in quite large doses anything from about  mg a day to  a day of getting rid of the cravings associated with alcohol addition which for many people are what drives the addiction. He cured himself of alcoholism using it in his view.There have been a few very encouraging studies and projects which confirm this but it is early days and so far baclofen has not been taken up as the cure many people seem to think it has the potential to be. Hope that helps.,BaclofenForAlcoholism,cwcoc8f,1,t5_2zmjq
