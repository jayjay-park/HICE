334576,0,t1_cfffuaf,I actually agree with you on a lot of points.People living off the grid would be examples of people who have escaped the system. Since theyre no longer subject to it they shouldnt have a say in it. One I hope to achieve thisI also agree that most people have no idea what the hell theyre voting for what the facts are nor do they care. As long as certain creature comforts are met they couldnt care less what the government does. I would encourage them to see viewpoints outside of corporate media like Fox CNN ABC NBC etc but thats another story,evolutionReddit,cffg6f7,0,t5_2tf60

1001139,0,t1_chhrj1i,Excellent points. First of all...gtThe changeover will be slow and gradual so nobodys hopping on new ideas when the old ones still work for us. I agree with you on this. It will be gradual. What may be worth researching is how much companies and corporations are ready to jump on the climate change boat. It seems as if oil companies and the Koch Brothers dont want to change for financial or political reasons. Im not sure that that will be accomplished first as you have suggested.Perhaps Im saying that there is more to be done to bring about this change more quickly. No change would happen at all were it not for some form of activism but this may be as small as having an open discussion with anybody whenever the topic arises. But I would think that theres more that can be done than that. Even simply encouraging people to change their habits a little bit would make an appreciable difference if its seen by thousands of people. For instance although I cant find the specific one I saw some time ago someone showed me a website that gave statistics on how most trips are within walkingbiking distance and then had a calculator that could estimate how much youre spending on gas. I guess Im saying what you said that theres no reason to start small. Anything that makes a difference. Perhaps starting a subreddit for more awarenessactivistoriented goals in making small changes similar to the above?,evolutionReddit,chi35ml,1,t5_2tf60

1460048,0,t1_ciz76sy,I largely agree with you you can decide as a society you have rights and theyre inalienable but if the government decides to violate them and you cantwont fight against it it doesnt matter. But just to nitpickdisagreegtHuman rights arent laws in the US.This is not true not even in a general sense and certainly not in a technical sense. The US Constitution is law and carries the force of law its a set of laws that say how our government is run its interpreted by the courts just like any other body of law. The Bill of Rights and certain further amendments basically lay out human rights our government to respect. There are further laws passed by Congress that define and protect other human rights. We are also party to treaties that define human rights and carry the force of law. So many human rights ARE laws in the US.gtNevertheless there is no practical distinction that can be drawn between privileges and rights. If it can be taken away by anyone else it isnt inalienable and everything can be taken away.I submit they can still be called rights and not privileges because for at least some of these rights at the most fundamental level of our selfgovernance we have declared these rules shall not be broken. That is what inalienable means  not that its physically impossible to violate them in which case declaring them would be a waste of paper but that theres no excuse for ever violating them. Theyre inalienable rights because infringing them is always wrong and it is technically impossible to alter or repeal them without returning to that most fundamental level a Constitutional amendment. Nothing else should be acceptable on the governments part. Without resorting to God nonsense I dont know how else you could define the word rights or inalienable in this context.The question is how well our government interprets follows and enforces these rights we have declared for ourselves and this is where you are correct. Just because we say our rights are inalienable doesnt mean they wont be violated we as a society are the ones responsible for policing our own government.The fact that we let our government get away with breaking the rules doesnt mean rights dont exist it just means our rights are being violated and we as a people arent doing enough to stop it.,evolutionReddit,cizaj8a,6,t5_2tf60

2992908,0,t1_co83pgq,gt And no I didnt watch the video because Ive seen enough videos of cops killing people.  Then how do you feel youre qualified to offer an effective argument on the matter?gtThere is a serious problem of police brutality in the US and the longer we talk about any particular instance the more we are missing the forest for the trees.Except it discredits our side thats right. Im a vehemnt supporter of police reform. when we lump every instance of lethal force in with abuse. Dont you get that? If we cant judge on a case by case basis why should we expect them to? Being unreasonable about these matters actively damages the cause.Edit. And stop offering videos of crazy people brandishing large blades. Its completely different than someone suddenly pulling a knife and trying to stab an officer.

This is the old few bad apples fallacy when it comes to police. If he was the only bad apple one of the other officers would have arrested him on the spot. Sometimes you have to push back to show that youre not going to lay down and die. ??? Is that some new organizational police sociological theory? Protect his city and calm things down. Hes the target of the riot. If they wanted to calm things down theyd get off the street. rioters and looters deserve retaliation. OK thats what you think however we dont have police in order to retaliate in fact their retaliation is what started this problem. So youve made my point for me.

7182994,0,t1_d1ukf1u,Nah I think its a more sophisticated strategy I think the Clinton campaign thinks that they have this basically wrapped up regardless of how true that actually is. Remember theyve been overconfident the whole campaign. And shes just started ramping up her big closeddoor fundraisers again so she clearly thinks that Bernie is no longer a threat to her on at least those grounds.So theyre trying to put him away once and for all  and not prolong this thing any further  by starting the narrative that maybe hes not a Democrat maybe hes not a team player maybe hes not qualified and the NY Daily News interview certainly helped them promote this narrative.This feels to me what an establishment politician would think of as a coupdegrace tactic once youve got your opponent pushed out to the margins anyway seeming like a losing fringe candidate again this is how I think they see reality then you suggest that they have never been a real read establishment politician to begin with. But like so many other Clinton strategies its basic assumption is faulty that everybody always wants to vote for an establishment politician.,evolutionReddit,d1un6h7,3,t5_2tf60
