One of the most important is freedom of speech the idea that we ought to LET people speak freely. That is what liberty means. When you shut down speech you kill liberty. The idea is that I may not agree with what you say but I will fight for your right to say it.Please think about it. It is liberty freedom that made the US great.,latinos,d7pxdzv,1,t5_2rd4u
