Im not trying to take advantage of anyone and Im not asking for slave labor. Im just asking for help with a project that Im very ambitious about accomplishing.

1562126,0,t1_cjbyx8w,Id vastly prefer fiber but I dont honestly see that as being an option for another decade throughout most of Bozeman. Charter really is my only choice since the other options are both slow and expensive.Im usually pretty lucky. I can often hit the mbps rate and only get brief service drops around once per month. So Ill consider this good news for now but well see once it finally rolls out.,Bozeman,cjc32x6,1,t5_2s4e7

1747898,0,t3_2ege1h,Cheapest and really your only option is Charter. CenturyLink is roughly the same cost for inferior service. I wouldnt bother with any type of Hotspot unless you almost never actually use the Internet. I dont know how much it costs monthly to have it added to a share everything plan on Verizon. Montana Opticom may be an option depending on where you live but they mostly operate around four corners Belgrade Manhattan Gallatin gateway and far west Bozeman. Their fiber service definitely isnt cheap and I dont know if they offer DSL. I hear they have the worst customer service though. ,Bozeman,cjzhdf2,4,t5_2s4e7
1785019,0,t3_2exx9o,Faithful Friends Animal Clinic  over by Perkins Dr. Doug Rains.  He takes care of our two dogs and three cats  yearly checkups shots sick animal visits.  Hes also been there for us when we needed to euthanize a cat dying of kidney failure made a housecall for this one and a dog who was dying of cancer.  Dr. Doug is a really personable guy too.We would also be comfortable taking our dogs and cats to All West Veterinary Hospital  a little west of Bozeman right off of Love Lane.  Thats where we board everybody if were taking a trip and dont have someone to look after them.  They require a checkin with a vet before the first stay and every doctor weve met with there  has been just as friendly as Dr. Doug.  The dogs love being boarded there  they go nuts every time we pull into the parking lot.  I have no idea what they do but apparently its pretty fun. ,Bozeman,ck45l9l,4,t5_2s4e7

3405160,0,t3_2z729t,Hey there!To name a few churches that I have some about of personal experience withGrace Bible Church Fairly traditional by most standards. Sermons are wellgrounded in scripture and people here seem to be fairly knowledgeable theologically. That said Ive known people whove tried Grace Bible out and found it a little difficult to make friends or get to know other members of the congregation. That said youre young enough to fit into the college age description so you could always stop by Graces college group to get to know a few people of similar age.EFree Church My impression of EFree having been a couple times though admittedly  years ago is that its a fairly good balance of admirable qualities. I know the senior pastor Jim Keena and hes a wonderful guy who knows scripture well. People here are fairly open and friendly and theres a wide range of people that attend a few professors from MSU even. Nothing bad to say about the place I definitely recommend trying it out.Venture Church Admittedly Ive never been to Venture but many of my friends and acquaintances from MSU go here. Younger vibe than the aforementioned two with an emphasis on getting involved within the church community. This is another place worth trying because if you feel like you fit in youll have plenty of opportunities to get involved unless things have changed. I hope things havent changed.Bozeman Christian Center Out of all the churches Ive mentioned this is the one Im personally most involved with and as a result its the one Im most critical of so Ill try to be kind. BCC is an AoG church and they do a fairly good job of supporting local charities causes and other community events. Sermons are fairly light serving more as uplifting reminders rather than digging deep into scripture or theology. A fair amount of age variance here but a good amount of sudents and a great number of loving individuals with differing opinions and backgrounds.If you have any questions feel free to PM me as well!,Bozeman,cpgew7c,6,t5_2s4e7

6365579,0,t1_czcy0em,Lets be real for a moment here and realize that the average temperature and weather in town is vastly different than at k feet at hyalite lake or other peak that are popular to camp. While a  degree bag is survivable for the night you really should be prepared with something more winter worthy. Though this winter has been pretty mild so far but there is too much snow to make it up to the peak without showshoes XC skis. I went in December and saw some guys postholing about a mile from the peak and it was up to their waist. It was about  ft at the lake then and a snow storm hit us over night.,Bozeman,czd72l3,5,t5_2s4e7
