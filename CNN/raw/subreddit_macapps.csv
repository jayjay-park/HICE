2035840,0,t3_2i2pf4,Im actually liking this more than Sketch and Illustrator so far. I can see this getting popular with web designers as it seems really geared to them with its pixel snapping and slicing features. Previewing in pixels is really cool too.,macapps,ckylm81,2,t5_2rt9r

6415794,0,t3_43kt57,My personal review of this As a student in computer science I find myself always in the midst of one of the following coding planning timelines for the upcoming months writing in LaTeX or Word and grinding through and endless number of research papers. Through all of these tasks I generally like to change between a number of screen resolutions depending on what will be onscreen.  For instance paper reading would require a smaller resolution to prevent tiring out my eyes. In contrast coding and development would benefit from a higher resolution and more screen realestate. QuickRes is pretty self explanatory due to its name. It allows fast changing of the screen resolution.  I originally came across this while looking for a solution to the quite limiting resolution on a  Macbook Air. While there are solutions such as QuickRes Pupil and SwitchResX EasyRes proved to be the most useful for this requirement. Each of the aforementioned utilities live in the menubar with an icon that can change resolutions or display a list of resolutions when clicked. The key differentiating functionality is that EasyRes shows a live preview of the new resolution!  An example gif is provided in Macworlds review  As I mentioned in the introduction I change resolutions frequently based on task. Seeing what the screen would look like before actually changing the resolution has proven to be a timesaver as I no longer have to cycle between resolutions until one that is suitable is found. EasyRes also works well with multiple displays by showing each display independently.  This is especially useful on a laptop where presentations are given often as external displays resolution need to be adjusted so that the audience does not need binoculars.  In the time Ive been using this I have gotten quite a few inquiries as to what app this was.  When using EasyRes on a larger screen the number of available resolutions can become quite unwieldily.  Luckily EasyRes allows resolutions to be hidden and custom labels to be displayed next to the numerical values. Finally EasyRes also differs from the other utilities as it also comes with a Notification Center widget.  While I cant say that Ive used this function often it is nice to have when using a Mac with a trackpad.  Overall I greatly enjoyed this app.  It greatly saves the amount of time needed to find the correct resolution needed for a given moment.  The loss of focus that comes with digging around in menus can drastically affect work.  Live previews provide a reprieve from that.  The only other request I would have is some form of keyboard shortcut. Perhaps to either switch to a given resolution open the menu and allow selection using arrow keys or to cycle between userselections. However that should not detract from the usefulness here and I would say that the functionality EasyRes provides is well worth the . cost especially when compared to other similar utilities at similar pricepoints.,macapps,cziwsue,-2,t5_2rt9r
