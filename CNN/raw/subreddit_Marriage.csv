We are both conservative Christians and she took it really rough.Im committed to her and nothing will change that. I know we both love each other very deeply. She always says that I am her miracle because she thought she would never find someone to love her.Im  and she is  so we both feel like were running out of time. She is also holding off on much needed allergy shots because she wants to have kids. If she gets the treatment we would have to wait  years before having children.,Marriage,cf3k0bk,1,t5_2reak

Why invite profiteers in by signing a marriage license ? Profiteers who will have license to redistribute ones income and assets as they see fit ? Its bad enough the family courts send our children off to live with strange men.  Do we really need them to be telling guys like Tiger Woods he should hand over  ?

753612,0,t3_22oezo,Sorry gonna have to side with your husband on this one. Your expectation and more importantly your reaction to porn is extremely immature and leads me to believe you have little to no concept about the breadth depth and novelty involved with male sexuality. Youre right to not believe him when he says he wont drink or use porn again because its an unreasonable and unfair expectation unless you guys are super religious?.The fact that porn makes you feel inferior is a FAR LARGER problem than his porn use. Your insecurity will absolutely poison and destroy this relationship if it hasnt already. You need to get a hold of yourself and shake off the Disney princess fantasy of being the only apple of his eye. He loves you but hes a man first and foremost. He will look he will have urges and he will wank in peace using whatever he has on hand be it porn on his phone or the memory of some other girls cleavage. Thats just how it is you can either accept it like a mature and understanding wife or continue to throw hissy fits and go crying to your mommy like..well..a child. Im not trying to be a bitch but man you gotta buck up lady. Youre a WIFE now that means you gotta figure your shit out like a reasonable adult WITH your husband. Not with your mom not with your besties not with your facebook friends seriously who does that? but with YOUR husband.

You will press charges and will seek a divorce.Abuse is abuse period. Male or female black or white. And you just wont put up with it any longer.Let her know that in the meantime that she needs help to control her anger issues and that since you still love her you will be doing everything you can to help her get on the right path. You both need to do everything possible to have constructive discussions on your relationship but destructive blowouts. Tell and show her you are serious. If anything itll cover your ass should things not work out.If she continues FOLLOW THROUGH on your threats. Sadly it is like dealing with a toddler throwing a tantrum sometimes.

Personally I would like to know so I could make a decision with all the info which is likely to be divorce  breakup but I respect couples who choose to do otherwise. My issue is not so much the breach of sexual exclusivity but the breach of trust. I have a very low tolerance for lying. gt we cherish what we have too much to let something so stupid as a meaningless fling to ruin our history together.I agree and this is why I would never cheat. I know my SO would not stay with me if I did and I cherish what we have too much to let something so stupid as a meaningless fling ruin our history together. Not to mention that I cherish him too much to hurt him like that.gt  That said I thought it was funny that he wrote into the prenuptial agreement TBH that looks a bit nave  silly to me. Maybe its because prenups are different where I live but a prenup is not the time and place for funny. To me a prenup is a contract with a set of legal enforceable mutual obligations. Its not a place to express wishes or crossonmyheart promises or decide who will have the moral high ground. Adultery does not void the contract is a valid clause though the more important clause is the one where you agree on what will void the contract as an aside note it is unclear whether the wording of your prenup consider physical verbal or emotional abuse as voiding the contract.Adultery doesnt justify divorce is just wishful thinking a romantic declaration. Its not enforceable obligation or clause if one of you decide to divorce because of adultery the cheater cant waive the clause in their face to avoid divorce. Unless your prenup contains different dispositions for justified divorce and unjustified divorce. In that case listing what is and what isnt a justified divorce is important and I recant what I said.gt And of course were not talking about serial adultry but a single incident.There is no and of course in a contract. Either you precisely define what adultery will mean in the context of your prenup or the common definition will apply i.e. the clause apply equally to a multiyears affair and a one night stand if the cheater used a condom or not and if it was with your sister.gt I mean if I wanted out of my marriage I could just sleep with someone else and get me ticket out? Seems cheap to me. ... If you cheat you cheat but youre never getting out of this THAT way!That doesnt really make sense to me. If someone wants out they can get out. They dont need a ticket out and they dont need cheating for it. And if they want to use cheating to get out they can do so anyway. I mean if the cheater wants out and was using cheating as a way out you can forgive all you want its not changing the outcome. Marriage is not a prison. TLDR I dont see anything wrong with your view though I do not share it. I would however recommend that you consult a lawyer to get the prenup drawn and keep what you have written as an unofficial conversation between you two.,Marriage,coa0fmo,6,t5_2reak

However Id have some major fucking issues with my husband seeking out amp building relationships with other random females for sex advice. MAJOR issues. Conversely Im fairly certain my husband would leave me if he discovered me having sexual conversations with males. Its not cool and I dont think you should feel bad for feeling suspicious because of it.Further if the relationship between your wife and Mr Navy revolves around sexual advice thats a Problem and she should stop that if its making you justifiably uncomfortable. If everything you say is accurate its a hypocritical shallow codependent relationship shes carrying on with this other guy at the very least.,Marriage,cpqbyc3,2,t5_2reak

3683504,0,t3_32kuo9,I have very similar cleanliness issues with my wife. I even posted about it here under a different name. It can be really frustrating but Ive never gotten to the point where its made me want to leave or anything. Heres what Ive come to realize regarding the cleaning  she is never going to change. Never. That sucks when youre the neater person in a relationship. It can be overwhelming. Ive come to realize that its just the way things are and I can overlook it since we love each other so much and she does other things in our relationship. Its something Im willing to compromise on because the alternative is to continually get angry and possibly ruin my relationship. And to be honest cleanliness is not something worth ruining a relationship over. I know it goes beyond just cleanliness. Its a feeling of being taken for granted or not respected. I cant speak to your case but I know my wife respects me and does other things for me so Ive come to not feel taken for granted. It took me a while to realize that. I was being a bit selfish. Ive also been married  years and have two kids  and .. Expecting someone to change after that long is futile imo. Does she know how unhappy its making you?A lot of the other feeling youre describing are very common among parents with young children. Its a hard job. It can break you if you let it. It does get easier though.gt So are we doomed?You dont have to be no. Have you talked to her about any of this? Open communication can go a long way. Its very natural to not be head over heels in love with the same person after  years.The religion thing is a whole other can of worms. Did you discuss this before having kids?

This is coming from a divorce lawyer.  Divorce is not pretty and almost always is devastating on the children as well as the parents.   Marriage is a life long commitment through both good and bad times you are going through one of the bad times now.  This is expected and not unusual.  Also you noted that you have a  year old and a  year old.  Young children are often harder on women than on men and the amount of time and emotional energy we devote to them is exhausting and draining.  Personally I find I only have so much emotional energy to expend and I expend it on my  year old first because he needs it the most.  What is left over goes to my husband sometimes not much is left.  My spouse can help this by picking up more of the childcare chores and housekeeping.  However if I have just spent the entire day cleaning the house changing diapers all day giving baby a bath comforting the baby after his fifth meltdown of the day and finally getting him put to bed and then the husband begins making sexual overturesnoits not going to happen. ,Marriage,ctrggf6,-1,t5_2reak

Anyway I have never had a baby but even the birth control pill made me extra crazy and reactive. Estrogen progesterone and all that.  What you describe  to me as a complete and total stranger  sounds like you love each other and you fit together well.  Try not to let this overwhelm you.  I was in a place where I told my husband not to initiate because it felt too overwhelming  even if he wasnt expecting sex.  I realized pretty quickly that was super unrealistic.   Doesnt really matter your gender people rely on body language to tell us how others feel and I need my husband to be relaxed around me.  Intimacy is more than sex.  Sex is really intense intimacy that floods your body with crazy hormones and makes you cry sometimes  or laugh...just random emotions while you are as close to another human as you can get.  One last thing before I have to shut up and go to work  the anxious mind will ruminate because it is engaging in things like mind reading mental filter catastrophizing which are unhelpful ways of thinking.

You can go to militaryonesource.com and they offer  free counseling sessions that are completely outside of the military and away from your chain of command.

You can also go to your base chaplain and ask for religios or secular counseling.  And finally you have the option of going over to mental health and asking for it there  but I had a bad experience with those folks.As far as you textingdating girls yourself  remember that adultery is a violation of the UCMJ and you can be reprimanded for it.Im dubious of this story though.  In this thread OP talks about being a girl with an IUD.  Not sure whats going on  maybe theyre lesbians I guess but generally someone would mention that.

7578875,0,t3_4j3mnd,I am   next month. I married my now yearold husband when I was . I was just like you  in love and ready to go for it and fuck everybody else with a cactus if they said anything about it. I cut a lot of people out of my life when I was ...Fortunately my parents were thrilled and my dad had my husband a job lined up immediately after we got married. I dont think I could have done it without their support. Weve been married for four mostly happy years. It hasnt been perfect though and honestly the first time I discovered a flaw in my husband and realized our love wasnt going to be fairytale perfect I cried for literally weeks and was diagnosed with major depression  months later. It wasnt even a major flaw like infidelity or religious incompatibilities. I was just that naive. I love my husband to death but I have had moments when the only thing stopping me from making a bad decision and leaving him was the financial ties I have to him.  When I discovered he was more outgoing than I was when I discovered I was bi and had gotten married before Id had a chance to kiss a girl when I discovered that marriage and adulthood in general were hard and required sacrifice and compromise that I wasnt happy about making I became clinically depressed and wanted desperately to run away from life even to the point of being suicidal but I had nowhere else to go. But I got pills and therapy and the unwavering and undying support of a husband who would buy me the world if it made me smile for fifteen seconds and I realized that even though marriage and adulthood could be a lot better the vast majority of people have it worse.Youre already paying your own bills and living away from your parents I had never lived outside my parents home before I married my husband so you sound a lot more mature and a lot less sheltered than I was. Therefore I would say if you trust him and you love him and you know who he really is go for it. But understand that there is a chance that something could happen a few months or years down the road that will make you regret having married young.,Marriage,d33ok19,1,t5_2reak

7646717,0,t1_d3av2yv,There is a lot of prejudice against having only one child. I come from a large family and  always considered a family with less than  children to be incomplete. It was actually reading on parenting subreddits that I changed my mind about that. I think it would be good for you both to really read up on the other side of things so your wife to read about raising an only child and growing up as an only child and you about the benefits of having siblings. Just so you will realise that you will be just fine either way. Because in the end the number of children is not at all defining for the happiness of your child or family. It is more about how you live your life your parenting style how loving your marriage is if you have a loving extended family or network etc. that will play a role in how your child will experience their childhood just as defining as the number of children.You are afraid you will have less to spend and this will limit your current familychild. Have you weighed this against the lifelong experience of having a sibling?You are afraid it will put a strain on your already strained marriage. Where does this fear come from? Did your marriage suffer during the early years of your first child? What is currently putting a strain on your marriage? Would you be willing to leave the option of another child open until after you tried to sort things out together in therapy? So for example you make the agreement to go to therapy together for  months and make a decision afterwardsAnd lastly you seem to hint at the option of separating to give your wife the opportunity to have another child. I hope I am wrong! Because if that is so you obviously were not being honest when you said you do not want another child because you want what is best for your current family. I dont see how splitting up would be better than adding another child. Also divorce and alimony is expensive as well. So I hope I misunderstood that bit if not I think there are some big things you left out.,Marriage,d3be21f,1,t5_2reak

The point is I chose him and he chose me. Why in the world would I not want to declare that I want to be with him forever? We were as poor as church mice when we got married. Our wedding was put on by generous family and friends who cooked for us. Our reception was at a public park. We didnt need to spend thousands of dollars on a wedding let alone on a ring. We just wanted to celebrate that we chose each other. Its not about being afraid or trying to prove something Im simply so dang proud to have him as mine that I WANT the world to know that we are promised to each other.And thats just it my marriage isnt a contract.

You agreed a friend of yours shouldnt be at your wedding and are mad at your wife for the end of that friendship. You turned down a job in the place you wanted to live. You forced her into paying her student loans at a rate that made you feel secure. You quit your job. Altogether it sounds like youre not really digging into your marriage and making joint decisions and at the same time you hold her responsible for all the parts of your own life that you hate and cant change. It sounds like your inlaws are a royal pain in the ass but that your wife is just struggling to find her way in the world and because she goes about it differently from you and has messed it up on occasion you want a divorce...? Its interesting that at no point in your saga here do you mention that youve done a single thing wrong or take any blame for anything. As long as you believe your wife is the root of your problems you will not succeed in this relationship or any subsequent relationships.What youre really looking for isnt marriage advice though but employment advice. You have options. Pursue as many as you can as deeply as you can. Find a mentor. In your nepotistic town it shouldnt be overly challenging for someone to want to show off their own prowess. Follow your wifes good advice for Gods sake and look for a job away from her family in a place you think youd be happier.

9408671,0,t3_59ei34,OP shemale porn is different but it is something that he likes. It is commonly called an erotic illusion generally because it is a misalignment between the appearancefemale but different organ. Because he is watching shemale porn and not gay porn would indicate that he finds females attractive. There can be a complete segregation for many people between what they enjoy to masterbate too and their level of sexual satisfactionattractiveness with their partner. I would not put too much effort on what porn he watches and more on the issue that you feel replaced by porn. That leads me to my second point. This is about a misalignment of sexual needs and releases. Many many guys masterbate almost as system maintenancerelaxation  and not even as a sexual need. I say this as that is what it sounds like as I have gone through it as well. You mention alcohol abuse and stress. Both of which cause not only a decline in testosteronesexual desire but mood as well. So he is basically rubbing one out so he can relax.I agree this is hugely insulting to you and what he is doing is selfish he is not meeting your needs and only focusing on his. There is hope. It can get better. I would talk to him about what he is doing and how it makes you feel. I would also get him to go to his doctor to talk to him about his lack of lust for life he should be checking the blood work as well as checking his testosterone levels. You both should be seeing a marriage therapist regularly as well as continuing AA. I want you to know that what he is doing is not a reflection of who you are.

9731049,0,t1_dacjlfy,gtI dont think our rough patch was me being cruel because I couldnt help it. My husband begged me to go to a doctor for a checkup and I refused I do feel bad for that.Sorry but your last statement contradicts your first.  Your rough patch was absolutely due in part to your cruelty.If I have a health condition that is completely treatable and its side effects directly impact the health and well being of my spouse I have a moral and ethical obligationnot even mentioning the marital vow aspectto seek treatment for it.  You fail to realize that by choosing to get married you also chose to voluntarily give up at least part of the control you have over your own life and your own body.  When you are married your body to some degree also belongs to your spouse just as in turn his body to some degree also belongs to you.  That does not mean that either one of you is enslaved or dominated.  It just means you no longer have the ability to say no just because you dont feel like it.  Saying no once in a while is perfectly fine.  Saying no for  months and refusing to seek treatment for it even after being begged by your spouse is incredibly selfish and cruel.  It is time for you to own that and realize your part in where you currently find the health of your marriage.  Also you may not feel once a week should be an issue but your spouse does.  That means you have a duty to him to find a compromise.  Youre sitting there wanting to know why hes seeking attention from other females when you keep wondering why he wont just conform to what you feel is the way things should be.  Thats not how marriage works.  You both have to work things out together.  That means you have to stop being selfish and start finding ways to serve him in the same manner he seeks to serve you.  In other words stop wondering why your marriage sucks when youve been demanding your way or the highway the whole time and he finally reached the end of his rope with that.Its tim to stop obsessing about making this story you have in your head true in reality.  At this point even if he is actually doing something inappropriate knowing the truth isnt going to solve anything.  You refuse to accept any responsibility for how you wound up here.

9798210,0,t1_dakkj8f,Everyone in a successful lifelong marriage has gone through these hardships.  As long as you remain partners in life youll be fine.  Keep your eyes on the prize.  When I got out of the Marines I had no marketable skills.  We were dirt poor and had two little boys to raise.  We couldnt afford daycare because she and I could only get minimum wage jobs which wont even pay for daycare.  We struggled we had some fights we sometimes said mean things to each other but we endured.  Neither of us did anything to truly destroy the marriage.  We paid our dues eventually both finished college and now financially everything is great.  When times get tough is when you double down on your love.  Even if you sometimes feel like youre the only one trying and the other spouse isnt thats ok you try that much harder.  What youll build is a love way deeper than honeymoon love or new love.  New love is all fantasy.  When you build that love by enduring lifes hardships its SO MUCH better than new love.  New love cant last and then what are you left with?  Thats why so many people just bail out.  I hope they wise up some day and enjoy the kind of love and respect my wife and I have for each other.

10007458,0,t3_5iyoeu,Thats tough man.  Im not sure theres anything you can do and I wouldnt recommend that you disclose anything to her that you dont want her family andor friends knowing about.   I almost ended up where you are.  My wife and I started out heading down that road.  Luckily for us we had a tragic example to learn from.   My wifes family is extremely close.  They all love each other very much they all help each other out with everything like oh peaches are on sale at my grocery store Ill buy some for you and drop them off at your house and you just transfer a couple bucks to my account kind of stuff.  By contrast my family was always big on self sufficiency like why the fuck would I need you to buy peaches for me?  What?  You think my legs broke or something?  GTFO..    So naturally that leant itself very naturally for my wifes siblings okay older sister to come crying to mommy and daddy when they had marital problems.  I stated way in the beginning that this was a horrible idea and that my wife and her parents needed to stay the hell out of her sisters marriage.  Nevertheless they encouraged this.  In so doing they absolutely poisoned the relationship between my inlaws and their other soninlaw.  They are not impartial judges and they have a knack for holding grudges apparently.  It also led to the inlaws being involved in nearly all aspects of their marriage it basically robbed the man of his ability to parent his children.  This led to two fucking train wrecks of children raised in a nonfunctional power dynamic where they quickly learned to play the various parties against each other.   Luckily whether due to my pointing it out every time her family made the codependency thing happen or from her own innate good sense my wife began to see the consequences that flow from such overinvolvement from the inlaws and she pulled back.   I also got piiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiisssssed when I found out she was just gabbing with the girls with no respect for our shared intimacy.  I dont generally get mad so I guess this instance made an impression.  But that part got nipped in the bud early. The family thing took longer.   I think maybe its a maturity thing?  I understood that the way my wife risked through things was by talking and I was basically taking away every shoulder she had to cry on so I didnt begrudge her all communicationadvice or anything.  But at the same time Im her husband.  Shes supposed to be able to talk to me and if Im the problem in the first place its probably the most effective way to handle it anyway.In any event it sounds like your problems may be resolving on their own?  If her own folks are sending her home and telling her to deal with her own shit it kind of sounds like you may have allies here that youre very lucky to have.  Sounds like theyre about done enabling this kind of childish shit.  Thats the good news.   Bad news is that youre married to a woman whos still a teenaged girl and didnt know how to handle grown up relationships and grown up intimacy.

Bottom line though its no ones business but yours and you could possibly change your mind later in life.  Your mom just wants to be a grandma is all she will be happy no matter how it happens she will be happy even if it doesnt happen.

10790924,0,t3_5u6gdm,I think a major detail youre leaving out of here is frequency and amount of use for both pot and alcohol. I know on your end you said that you compromised for this on poker nights but were you coming home stoned out of your gourd? And really reflect on that question  as someone in their mids it wasnt until I quit smoking that I realized that yes everyone else around you can usually tell youre high. You just dont think they can because well youre high. I totally see your side in thinking that it is only reasonable that in asking you to give up your substance she give up her substance. But its really not fair. She asked you to stop because it is clearly something that bothers her. The way that you phrase even this post comes across as you trying to punish her for her request and IMHO sounds petty.Where I do think your wife was being unreasonable is in not accepting your compromise of limiting it to poker nights. I suspect there is more going on even if subconsciously with your wife than its just how she was raised. My suggestion would be to get to the root of that issue. Ask her if there is something about your behavior while you are high that bothers her. Just like with alcohol theres quite a lot of rather annoying social side effects of being high that youre not immune to and probably not aware of that can be very obvious and frustrating to deal with for the sober party. FYI youre probably not going to have a leg up in the counseling on this issue. Most counselors arent going to condone or support illegal activity that is negatively impacting one spouse even if its just pot. Good luck. ,Marriage,ddt0a7d,1,t5_2reak

The problem is getting him to realize it is in that rough of shape. If he is suffering depression possibility due to whatever circumstances that needs to get treated because when you are really deep in a hole of depression you dont know you are depressed. You both need to start marriage counseling. From this you both need to be open an honest about how you are feeling in the marriage and what you need.

My engagement ring to my wife she considered it her engagement ring actually it was just a birthday present from me was only  canadian.Most women that I know would be happy with a nice looking ring regardless of the cost.Why do men want to marry women who expect expensive shiny rocks with no resale value whatsoever is a better question.Furthermore last Christmas I was not doing so well financially and couldnt afford to get her a very expensive gift I got her a bottle of pretty nice perfume she bought me a  macro lens for my camera I only know the price because I was searching for macro lenses at the time plus she got expensive gifts for my family some of whome she never met.  She is just thoughtful like that I never expected such things.Its also terrible to just generalize half the worlds population but different cultures have different social norms and for some reason some cultures really think that the marriage industry is deserving of their money.

He mostly feels uncomfortable with them making it really hard to want to spend any time with them at all. So I usually go and visit them with my baby myself. I actively am learning that new role as a wife weve been married for  months it took me a bit specially cause I just gave birth also and everyone wants to be with baby. It has been really hard for me I am what you would call a daddys girl and the only girl in our family. My parents say I have distanced myself from my whole family my husband worked graveyard shift it took a toll in our new marriage our new parenthood everything I feel really guilty of distancing myself from my parents and siblings but I know that I need this time with my husband. TBH I dont know currently how to deal with these feelings from both sides I feel I gotta mature or maybe theyre sort themselves out with time as life comes together for us. I still visit my parents every week usually when husband is at work or at his university. I am a sahm and Im starting to grasp that reality and that life I am working towards applying to medical school. Its hard I feel for both of you. IMHO you both need to be patient with each other and communicate everything not hold things in most importantly let go of any feeling of resentment and remember that she is feelings many things too I know I am and have been and will... If you both love eachother this will work itself through and she will learn her place it in your home. She needs to visit her family when youre not or with you because that time you ARE home is precious and the fact you want to spend time with your little girl she needs to respect and value that. Many mothers out there wish their kids dad would want that. I feel you should treat her to something nice as her job is also really hard sahm isnt a joke and eventually she should come off her high horse and talk.

She was fun vibrant and loved to go out. Sally was always Christian and I would never have called her a sinner but she enjoyed life.Along the way Sally met Gabe. They were married sometime around Sallys second job and in the middle of her third she became pregnant with her first child. Children had always scared Sally and shed never been sure that she wanted them so it was a bit surprising but we found out that Gabe was ALL IN on kids and it was kids or divorce. So they had a kid.Sally never went back to work. They decided together that Sally should stay home with their child while Gabe worked. Gabe lost his job but Sally still had to stay home while Gabe hunted for another job although she couldve easily picked her old job up. This happened several times over the years. Sally also swore she was done with kids but somehow several years later Sally was pregnant again.I dont see Sally much anymore. Shes not that fun and doesnt go out much because she has to care for her children. When we do see her its strained. There seem to be a lot of decisions that Sally is making these days together with her husband that dont really seem like decisions Sally would make. For instance when Gabe came home with a gun. Sally doesnt like guns never has but they decided together that it was needed for home security so they kept the gun.Sally is not the Sally I knew back in the day. We all change but Sally is a completely different person. Its weird but I feel bad for Sally when I see her these days. Its nothing specific that she says or does but the downtrodden heir she gives off. She used to be a driven careerwoman that was full of life and now shes a stay at home mother in a house with an armed husband.,Marriage,dgjeilr,2,t5_2reak

Perhaps I ended up in a relationship that was easy as everything else in my life was so intense and involved. But I want a marriage that is passionate not boring How long have you been married for? Do you still feel trapped? ,Marriage,dgwjic8,2,t5_2reak
