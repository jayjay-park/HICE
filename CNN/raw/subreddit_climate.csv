2959574,0,t3_2u1in3,Thanks for an interesting post. I personally dont think ice extent is a particularly good metric for judging the state of the ice since thinner ice is more susceptible to wind and surface currents and so spreads out easier increasing extent. Volume is therefore a much better predictor of the state of the ice imo. My suspicion is that we have now entered a oscillation state for Arctic sea ice extent where anomalously large melt years e.g.   are followed by years of less extensive melting. Whilst these big melt years reduce albedo and allow the absorption of heat into the surface layer of the ocean the low extent also allows significant amounts of heat to escape from the Arctic ocean during the SeptemberNovember refreeze removing the lid so to speak which allows thicker ice to subsequently form in the main icethickening months between DecemberMarch. This would imply a longer tail of the ice extent decline than some people have previously proposed. Of course this is just my view after several years of following arctic ice trends and isnt backed up by any literature that I know of so take it with a big grain of salt ,climate,co4ines,5,t5_2qhx3

3107038,0,t1_cok1k3x,ampampamp History of military technology sfw gtgtThe military funding of science has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of scientific research since the early th century. Particularly since World War I advanced sciencebased technologies have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.gtWorld War I is often called the chemists war both for the extensive use of poison gas and the importance of nitrates and advanced high explosives Poison gas beginning in  with chlorine from the powerful German dye industry was used extensively by the Germans and the British over the course of the war scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.  Physicists also contributed to the war effort developing wireless communication technologies and soundbased methods of detecting Uboats resulting in the first tenuous longterm connections between academic science and the military. gtWorld War II marked a massive increase in the military funding of science particularly physics. In addition to the Manhattan Project and the resulting atomic bomb British and American work on radar was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft as well as the radarbased proximity fuze Mathematical cryptography meteorology and rocket science were also central to the war effort with militaryfunded wartime advances having a significant longterm effect on each discipline. The technologies employed at the endjet aircraft radar and proximity fuzes and the atomic bombwere radically different from prewar technology military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars. The advent of the Cold War solidified the links between military institutions and academic science particularly in the United States and the Soviet Union so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand. Funding spread to the social sciences as well as the natural sciences and whole new fields such as digital computing were born of military patronage. Following the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union military funding of science has decreased substantially but much of the American militaryscientific complex remains in place.gtThe sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding especially for American science. Since Paul Forman  article Behind quantum electronics National security as a basis for physical research in the United State  there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected scienceparticularly physicstoward applied research and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners. An alternate view has been presented by Daniel Kevles that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research scientists byandlarge retained their intellectual autonomy.gtgtImage iInteresting Military technology | Outline of technology | Bundeswehr Military History Museum | Outline of military science and technology Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcokkpc oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecokkpc.

This could limit consumer options drive up prices and stifle innovation. That in turn could put a freeze on consumers interest in solar and ultimately slow down the rate at which it is adopted.

5236629,0,t1_cvgs8at,I think its a pretty serious risk. Our society hasnt been shaken like this before. The collapse of previous civilizations will pale in comparison to what we are facing now.Consider just food production. So much of the efficiency of food production is climaterelated. Hot years and cold years can lower efficiency. With a consistently hotter environment youll get more crop failures worldwide. Those with money to pay can still afford to eat probably... for now. Up and moving all the farms further north can be done but thats a serious project  and the hotter it gets the further you have to go. We also have to move the entire food distribution network. Countries that lose access to food production because they are too hot possibly even the US are going to be paying even more. Water is going to be a similar topic.Theres a real risk in my mind that even just based on agriculture alone were in serious trouble if we hit .C. Certainly any nation that doesnt make their own food because it is too hot to grow food is screwed once the shortages hit. Small nations or nations that rely on northern farms are also going to have problems.Next consider that we actually have to stop it and at some point people will get that. Theyll have to try. At that point it will mean shutting down almost everything that generates greenhouse gases. Maybe well have fully electric transportation options powered by a nonfossil fuel grid by then but I kind of doubt it. So on top of all of that you cant drive your car you cant buy gas you cant use a generator you have infrequent access to electricity and you cant ship things in bulk easily. Is rebuilding the infrastructure we need for mass agriculture even possible?Then we need to account for the cm of sea rise. Thats going to mess with our port cities its going to mess with some agriculture without intervention. Ongoing sea rise beyond that will continue to complicate the situation.Then theres politics. In a nation as volatile as the US with right wing attack dogs chompin at the bit to bomb somebody already I would be very worried that the response to a foodsupply shortage in the US is going to be war. Even if the US doesnt have a shortage other nations will have their eyes on securing food supplies in time of shortage. When you consider the chaos and how dependent we are as a society on specialization were kind of screwed as a species. We can get could have got? out of it through concentrated effort and bringing people together but we cant even get enough Americans to agree on whether or not its happening!Some people just want to watch the world burn.. and today Im one of them.

5411894,1,t3_3p5psm,They should be ashamed telling them such bullshit. Climate change can be solved and life high consumption can more or less continue with low density alt energies that cannot be created mined transported manufactured and installed without fossil fuels? Its simply a matter of political will? Ya physics doesnt count. The pin on the AGW grenade has been pulled and it will go off no matter what. Solar is at a whopping  of global electricity generation after  years or so. Is there any mining for the needed raw materials that is done with non carbon solutions? Nope all diesel. How much heavy transport is solar? Every manufactured piece of hardware andor all raw materials from overseas are delivered via bunker fuel  the dirtiest on the planet then there are diesel powered trains and tractors. How much manufacturing is solar? Do solar panels the accompanying hardware and the workers get transported to the site in electric vehicles?How can something that cannot be produced without fossil fuels be called a solution to fossil fuels? Maybe for a shrinking portion of privileged westerners and only for some of their residential electricity demands. Certainly not for any of the electrical energy embedded in their never ending piles of consumer crap. Then there is the fact that all this tech generates a waste stream that is an environmental holocaust all of its own. Attempting to replace massive amounts of infrastructure with low energy density solar and wind will continue to destroy more habitat and speed up the th mass extinction.

6045467,0,t3_3yax6o,Dr Dyson sure buddy sureI love the hallucinating denier routine. This article is from  Feb  so youre less than  years behind! Thats a lot better than some psychtic deniers! Are you proud? Zombie arguments live forever in the internet age no matter how many times theyve been refuted.Hint Its  Dec . Try to keep up. Did you actually know what year it was before you read this?DFD Do you agree that according to the global temperature record used by the IPCC the rates of global warming from   and  were identical? ...The warming rates for all  periods are similar and not statistically significantly different from each other. ...PGA Yes they were statistically indistinguishable NOT identical in the HadCRUT dataset which ALWAYS underestimates warming. Thats because its not a global record but rather a record of  of the Earths surface omitting the poles amp some central continents. Since the poles are warming fastest with the Arctic warming  times faster than the rest of the globe the HadCRUT dataset is always inadequate.At NASAGISS they interpolate Arctic temps from nearby ground stations. Then in late  Cowtan amp Way used satellite data to fill in the gaps in the HadCRUT record. They showed that current warming is significantly faster than the HadCRUT temps say amp even faster than the NASAGISS temps say.Proxies tell us there was no significant Arctic melting during previous warming phases very much unlike today. The NASAGISS data show that each warming period you identify had faster warming.But moreover SO WHAT?!?!? The rate of cooling during each cooling cycle associated with negative phases of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation of course amp to a lesser extent with negative phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation is slower in the HadCRUT dataset.And cooling occurs at a MUCH slower rate than warming even from . Whats more the recentlyended cooling cycle  showed no cooling at all!So what we have is every IPOPDO negative cooling phase showing less cooling amp every IPOPDO positive warming phase more warming. This is not hard for people in the realitybased community we are having increasing COinduced warming superimposed on the oceanic cycles. And rather than a sawtooth pattern its much more like a staircase with the stairs having everincreasing angles.DFD Do you agree that from  to the present there has been no statisticallysignificant global warming?Yes but only just.PGA Good thing you found this interview from early . By a year or two later it had turned statistically significant.DFD ...palaeoclimatic data are considerably less certain than the instrumental data.PGA And you highlighted this because...? Is it a big discovery for you that proxies are less accurate than thermometers? Theyre still less accurate today given the abominations coming out of the UAH satellite record.DFD As Marc Sheppard wrote in December The decline Jones so urgently sought to hide was not one of measured temperatures at all but rather figures infinitely more important to climate alarmists  those determined by proxy reconstructions.PGA What utter nonsense. Heres a hint the way to determine the temperature of the Earths surface after  is THERMOMETERS. Etch that in stone OK?Proxies are never valued more than thermometers after  unless the thermometer record is extremely sparse. The only reason to even look at them is to have a sufficient overlap period for standardization. Proxy reconstructions are for PREINSTRUMETAL temps.DFD Briffas treering data showed a decline in temperatures between  and ...F Here of course youre just lying. Briffas data showed a decline in TREE RING WIDTH amp a corresponding increase in density in SOME northern trees. Thats NOT the same as temperatures. And we know temps were rising from the thermometers remember? The Divergence Problem was identified BEFORE the hockey stick or the emails in question so trees after  were known to be unreliable as proxies.DFD ...as the treering numbers deviated so demonstrably from the observed temperature data between  and  why should anyone believe theyre accurate for any periods in the past that cant be confirmed with instrumentation?F As SOME NORTHERN trees showed. Other than that this is actually a good question. But its long since been answered given the roughly  studies of paleotemps that cover the MCA using DIFFERENT proxies than tree rings  ice cores corals sediments speleothems etc bore holes dont go back that far.They ALL show the hockey stick pattern when comparing MCA temps with modern measured temps. All of them. Its warmer today especially given the warming since . And they all show that the tree ring data are generally correct.BTW lets be clear about one thing any study that DOESNT use Mikes Nature trick grafting modern measured temps onto proxies for past temps for modern temps amp claims to be comparing them to paleotemps should ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY be discarded. Anyone who says otherwise would be the sort who if doing research or a school project on local temps during the s amp s instead of checking with the local weather bureau would drill a hole in a tree. Oh that makes sense... NOT.Again thermometers are better than proxies after .DFD The entire global warming myth depends on treering data that was grossly errant for forty years in the last century.F This is just iditic absurdity. The theory of ACC is a consilience of many lines of evidence. Deniers always hallucinate that if you just discredit one set of data or one climatologist that somehow refutes the theory.Sorry it doesnt. Multiple lines of evidence are simply overwhelming all converging on the same theory. And its correct. That doesnt mean there are no unanswered questions but it does mean that the basics are true beyond a reasonable doubt.

The author of the paper that claimed the world was going into an ice age has spoken may times about that article.  No one was ever certain that there would be no ice left in the Arctic by now. You dont understand the context of your wording.Arctic Sea Ice just hit a record low in the middle of winter  Arctic sea ice was at a satelliterecord low for the second month in a row. The first three weeks of February saw little ice growth but extent rose during the last week of the month.

10857196,0,t3_5v5tji,Hey undergrad Animal Behaviorist here.As of now my education has taught me that in this regard yes it will. For example theres a climatologist technically amateur Billy Barr who noted that a certain species of humming bird and the flowers they pollinate were active in the same area for only  days a year that perfectly aligned with one another. This kind of research is quite rare however that doesnt mean that such an event is. Ive learned how cyclical our ecosystem is and that timing is one of the most important aspects of any species life whether it be mating foraging for food predation or migration. Explicit studies of these systems are rare as many are not necessarily obvious to a study that focuses on one species or one season or even one year. Many of these events which have never been on a variable schedule are tied to weather patterns. This is fine for us however the natural world doesnt operate on the Julian calendar.I hypothesize that this year has brought us even closer to these desynchronization events. What youre seeing may not have negative impacts if there is still enough overlap for critical behaviors to still be carried out but that day is coming very soon and it will have a very negative impact on wildlife. Imagine if bats become active  weeks before the insects come out. Or if half of a species only spends  of its allotted time on its mating grounds.I do not believe it is a very positive outcome. Also this is definitely a product of climate change. Evolution functions to maintain homeostasis in an ecosystem and the ecosystems checks and balances maintain a stable climate. The only way this can shift as dramatically as it currently is is when it is being forced to do so.Maybe someone else can give you a more positive answer but discreetly I weep for the geese the cranes and the springtime rains.,climate,ddzud4y,2,t5_2qhx3
