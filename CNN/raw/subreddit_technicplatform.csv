Just to be sure though go to your .technic.atlauncher folder if you type appdata in your start menu search you will see these folders incase you didnt know then navigate to your saves folders and move your saves to your desktop or documents or somewhere. Then when you sign into your new account you can reverse this process to put your saves back in their folders.,technicplatform,cyb35g3,1,t5_35vj3
