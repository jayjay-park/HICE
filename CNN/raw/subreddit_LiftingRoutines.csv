1524550,0,t3_2boe57,Pretty much any machine exercise will have a free weight analog. Just replace them. Free weights are a bit more stressful so the only issue you might have is it may be hard to recover if you try to replace every exercise in say PHAT with free weights. But if thats the case then just do fewer sets.,LiftingRoutines,cj7dnv0,2,t5_32nmr
1524784,0,t3_2bofp9,Whats with the  billion chest exercises? What are your stats like?I would honestly tone down on the volume and do chest x a week with bench and another exercise of your choice with bench being heavy. But remember that your body is your body and if you find that volume works for you keep at it.,LiftingRoutines,cj7epyk,1,t5_32nmr

3337867,0,t1_cp8q1iz,Did you read?? He does a PPL split just like you. What uawinnarisyou is trying to say is that by doing a PPL split you are decreasing the direct stimulus to arms and rather stimulating them indirectly due to arms being complementary movers in push and pull exercises and instead maximizing frequency. Frequency being how many times you train a particular muscle group in a week. So there is no isolation day for arms. Only push pull legs repeat. Rest when necessary.Side note If you are truly  lbs I hope you are talking to a licensed dietitian. I cannot offer dieting advice but from the reading I have done I would recommend to someone of your size starting a ketogenic diet and sustaining that for a couple of years. This is not me offering you advice though because I am not a licensed dietician. I am simply a brofessor.,LiftingRoutines,cp8qqfg,2,t5_32nmr

3677087,0,t1_cq18kmp,The routine you posted is solid for a novice. Theres really no need to add a bunch of extra accessories as trebemot is suggesting. SS  SL are good if your goal is primarily strength gains hence the names. I tried both SS and SL and later moved on a to a hypertrophy programme which is very similar to the one you posted I found my overall physique was a lot more balanced and I looked a lot better with that routine than with SSSL.,LiftingRoutines,cqbeu9f,1,t5_32nmr

4271696,0,t3_39ved9,While its fine to squat every workout I would probably try to avoid it or at least alternate between a heavier and a lighter variation back squat  front squat or back squat  paused back squat which lets you recover. As for your question since accessory work shouldnt really be done for weight I would probably go A   Squat  Bench  Row  Superset bentover side raises  hammer curls  Calf raises B  Deadlift  DB OHP  Light squat  Superset bentover side raises  hammer curls  Calf raisesAdditionally if you want to row on deadlift day you can switch to a less lowerback intensive variation such as dumbbell rows or chestsupported rows.,LiftingRoutines,cs74ybm,1,t5_32nmr
4887816,0,t1_cuan0nb,I prefer seeing it as reps  sets  percentage of your RM Dealing with actual weight values might become irrelevant. A kg bench might be a very though weight for one person and warm up weight for the next person.At the same time it sort of streamlines volume. If you are hitting about  reps total per exercise its safe to say you arent really working above  of your RM unless you are doing stuff like  sets of  or whatever.This is also why the  to  range  to  reps is considered ideal for hypertrophy.,LiftingRoutines,cuanbd6,1,t5_32nmr

5989225,0,t3_3xh747,if  is even intermediate for your bodyweight its barely so so youll still want a beginner program. You could either modify starting strength or Stronglifts by dropping squat from one of the days so you can do ABAB  days in a row without squatting backtoback. Or as you suggest you could run either XPPL or PPLP PlPP lPPP etc. There was a popular thread a while back about a PPL program more geared for beginners ,LiftingRoutines,cy4pvm9,1,t5_32nmr
