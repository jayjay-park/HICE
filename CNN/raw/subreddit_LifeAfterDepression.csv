2297073,0,t3_2ljfmq,Hey Im a year old male living in the Netherlands studying to become a highschool math teacher.My depression built up over the span of about a year directly following a cardiac arrest which forced me out of what I considered my dream job a career in the military. Since puberty I have always had small bouts of mild depression or at the very least was sensitive to it but the cardiac arrest was what finally sent me into the pits.The combination of losing all prospects of being where I wanted to be most the army with the distrust of my own bodys capabilities caused me to fall deeper and deeper into a depression. By the time I sought help in the form of therapy I was fantasizing about suicide multiple times a day was in bed for the majority of the day and lost all but one of my friends.It took me a year of therapy and a high dosage of antidepressants to get me out of it. This spring I stopped taking my medication and so far I have not relapsed. I love the prospect of being a teacher and have gotten over my fear of physical exercise. Everything seems good.But the Black Dog is still there in the back of my mind. My selfesteem is incredibly low and each day I feel the depression nipping at me. Every day is a fight to keep it away and I can never let my guard down.Im happy to see this sub created. I dont feel right posting in rdepression but cant deny that Im still struggling. I hope to see this sub turn into a place I can talk about the issues I face daily and possibly share what has helped for me.,LifeAfterDepression,clvmttj,6,t5_34ex5

Ive been reading for the last hour on rdepression and trying to get some more information on how Ive been feeling with limited success. My TSD time since depression is  months. Whats up?,LifeAfterDepression,dg11qza,1,t5_34ex5
