The organization convention lasts all week and I was naive to think the Wolf a master con and schemer would be finished after day . Glocal returned to the scene of the crime to wreak more havoc.He talked to another member doing pretty much what you described. He chatted and began to gain the trust of the members and finally asked to take a stack of flyers to distribute. I didnt see this handoff but I know this happened because of what comes next. We have a diabetic support group on campus of which my friend is a member. He described the groups encounter with Wolf as awkward and a big misunderstanding but I was able to see through Glocals clever ruse. Wolf somehow managed to find out when and where the diabetic group was meeting for that month and showed up to the meeting  second before it began. He was described as enthusiastic suave and everso coy. He said he was going by all the rooms in the building and handing out flyers for the baking club. He went into extreme detail describing the sugary confections and carboloaded pastries the baking club was famous for. The diabetics seeing how passionate he was about baking felt too uncomfortable to tell him that they could not enjoy these delicious treats because of their condition. Wolf went on for a few minutes to draw out the tension and uneasiness and had a single tear run down his cheek at the end of his spiel. He left the flyers in the room and left onto the next scheme.,jonwolf,cuo9spj,4,t5_35buo
