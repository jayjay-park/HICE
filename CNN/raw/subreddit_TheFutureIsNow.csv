9032262,0,t1_d7x6a4g,I dont think appealing to Adam Sandler is going to help you design a flying hovercraft. And it is a hovercraft a hoverboard of sorts not a jetpack.  I got  downvotes for saying that. Reddit is so unbelievably retarded I have no idea why I spend time in the comments sections with you fucking losers.   You got to be at Burger King tomorrow to work on the fryer leave Aerospace design to the real men something America doesnt make any more. ,TheFutureIsNow,d7xj9n3,1,t5_2yamw

11645694,0,t1_dgfz7lf,El Mucho Realism. Majestic mountains and landscapes cities. Like flying in a drone. Its a teaser style teaser. Not much info beyond some quick visuals.I heard birds and wind and city sounds. I hope that was just for the video and they arent doing SimCity style sound effects. On second thought yeah wait that might be pretty neat. The background ambient audio was very apparent over the music. So maybe.They didnt show if the desktop version doesnt clug down and crash after an hour or so use. Maybe next teaser.,TheFutureIsNow,dgg1xd0,9,t5_2yamw
