1260131,0,t3_22hneu,I play with four people and I got a good foothold in North America in the early games so either its a good place for me to start or if someone else starts there it hobbles their expansion for a turn or so early game. I tend to stay away from Europe because it has so many openings you have to have troops all over the borders. I also find Australia to be a death trap. ,Risk,cibdp6l,1,t5_2qmbc

11669502,0,t3_66bef8,For starters Youll want to make some clear borders for the continents. Like outline each continent with a distinct pastel color. Its very difficult to tell how you grouped the territories and as a result i cant really give you any specific advice.Secondly Omega your western island continent needs to connect to the eastern landmass. A key part of risk is that the continents are linked on the periphery of the map Alaska and kamchatka which allows multiple directions of attack. Its all about maintaining balance and right now the continents on the right and left edges have a huge geographic advantage over the middle continents.Lastly continent bonus is determined by  how accessible the continent is and  how many spaces it has. Even though South america and Australia have the same number of territories within SA has  points of invasion meaning it gets deserves to have a larger territory bonus. editThey are worth the same though and as a result people largely scramble for Australia.  Asia is worth the most because it has a very large number of spaces and is also very vulnerable to attack. edit typos and errors,Risk,dgir5a0,1,t5_2qmbc
