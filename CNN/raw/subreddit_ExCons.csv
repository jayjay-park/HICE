674587,0,t3_21uswp,you should probably stop breaking into peoples shit and stealing. you knew the rules and you violated  at least twice by your own admission. an attorney cant really help you paid or not. you should take the time youre about to get in jail and figure out why you cant do right and work for stuff instead of stealing it. its difficult to have much sympathy for you. ,ExCons,cggy8mh,8,t5_2xrpd

Just very qualified and very hard working and they knew it  I was actually still on probation when I was hired.  Im sorry to hear that about your SO. Never fun. I was technically fired from my fast food job when they ran a background on me but they never followed through.  I had deferred adjudication and its unfortunate that they mislead you with how its going to be handled when the case is over. ,ExCons,cpy6eni,1,t5_2xrpd

I had one altercation with a guy who thought I was a sex offender I wasnt. They had to pull me off the much larger guy. I did  weeks in SHU the hole and my credibility went through the roof when I returned to the unit.A first offender nonviolent man of  with a sentence under ten years will almost certainly go to a Camp not an FCI. No fences they work in town drive people places and typically provide service to attached FCIs. When and if he is sentenced have him ask the judge to recommend he be sent to the Camp at Otisville NY. Its the nicest spot in the entire fed prison system.The fact he is black will actually be a help to him. Tell him to not worry find friends his own age and intellect and the worst thing that will happen to him will be the incredible boredom. Arrange a book shipment from Amazon every couple of weeks make sure he has commissary money and hell be just fine.Any questions please feel free to ask me.,ExCons,cr9nq5p,9,t5_2xrpd
4134510,0,t3_37qpb5,Okay so I went to the joint in california when I was  years old and was released when I was . I got out and stayed out. I discharged parole within my first year and stayed out of the joint since then. As far as looking for work I was always honest and always wrote will explain after the disclosure. I prefaced my explanation with my age at the time of the offense and admitted to being foolish in my behavior then went on to explain how I have changed and grown and assured them that I was a straight man and that they would never have any issues with me. It has worked for the last  years and I have been licensed with the state for various occupational licenses which require background and criminal history disclosures. For me it was never a hinderance if I got the job if not I moved on and went looking for someone to believe in me and I will tell you once I was in I made a difference in their culture and bottom line. good luck and have a blast man life is good even after a rough start.,ExCons,crrk07e,1,t5_2xrpd

5163633,0,t3_3lqcsq,Not an ex con have been in minor trouble. I am posting because your lawyer should have answered all of this.  You should be questioning your counsel incredibly hard right now.  You are very likely going to take a plea deal everyone takes plea deals.  You should know exactly what the plea will be at some point before an actual sentencing of any kind.  Question your lawyer very hard especially a public defender.  Dont get fucked over with a shitty lawyer.  If it costs money then pay it.  A good lawyer cost me a shitload of money but I have a clean record because of it.  I actually felt guilty at how good a deal my lawyer got me.  I straight up payed a huge fine to avoid jail time.If you have to go to prison or jail my advice again as someone who has spent only a few days in jail would be to keep your mouth shut.  Obviously dont antagonize anyone.  Be willing to fight I personally have teriiblegreat luck and was assaulted  hours into my first stay in jail.  A bigger guy saved me and that was that.  Shit happens I was asleep when i got assaulted.  I wouldnt recommend sleeping while in a holding cell with a bunch of guys.  ,ExCons,cv8eqv1,4,t5_2xrpd

5564512,0,t1_cwm05lm,To be clear this only applies to federal jobs at the moment. If you go down to a local business they may still have something asking you about your past. However if past history on things like this is anything to go by it will end up spreading. Why? Because private companies that have federal contracts will have to follow the majority if not all federal hiring laws  including this one. Wait a little before you judge the impact this will have.As for the effectiveness you will still most likely get a background check done or be asked about your record at some point. The benefit though is that if you make it past the resumeapplication review you will most likely get through to a point where you can interview or theyll ask you to questions to prove your record wont be an issue. It wont be the reset that would be fairest but it is a start!,ExCons,cwmttoe,3,t5_2xrpd

8421028,0,t3_4uz9qy,For me I was dealing with a sex offense at a federal holding facility in Detroit. . I wasnt from there . I was lumped in a holding cell for  days with all different kinds of people kidnappers drug traffickers gang members etc.The biggest thing for me was to keep my head down until I was situated in the proper area where I would be for the remainder of my  month stay. I kept my paperwork on me at all times. I kept my mouth shut but if people asked why I was there I simply said DUI. I never initiated conversation with people I didnt feel comfortable with and always respected other peoples space. The biggest rules I learned from some of the big time inmates is to treat everyone with respect. The moment you step out of line someone somehow is going to correct you. In that situation you need to be ready to defend yourself . Be honest with people in your group. If they ask what your in for and you are in the right group of inmates just tell them. Trust me if they want to find out because you wont tell them they will find out one way or another.Respect EVERYONE guards inmates nurses and especially the inmates who take care of your laundry food and trash. Respect their privacy space and belongings. Do not ask to borrow anything you do not intend on returning or paying for. Example you need a pencil and paper or a stamp to send mail...you better replace that item as soon as you can or do something on equal value for that individual. Never let anyone get your phone access code if you have one. Do not let anyone know your address. This goes with the respect part its huge in jailprison NEVER call anyone a bitch or punk. I got away with all the time because I established early on that Im not there to cause trouble and simply like to make everyone laugh. I have seen someone get knocked out cold to the hardest slap to the face ever imagined...kind of funny though. Just dont do it unless its the right crowd.Pick up hobbies like drawing workout A LOT chess reading crosswords tv etc. I was lucky because we played charades and chess everyday so that was nice. I also picked on the biggest baddest guy in my cell a lot he laughed at it because we both knew he could take me out anytime he wanted. Once again I strongly advise against this lol. One of my cell mates was a chess master who had several chess books published and he taught me everything there is. He could beat me with pawns alone. Would I do it again? Helllllllllll noooo! But it wasnt too bad I was super lucky. I was at the wrong place at the right time. I even learned how to crip walk and do the hand signs from a gang member I played cards with everyday. I had to make sure I wasnt being initiated or anything beforehand of course...Im so white.,ExCons,d5u668z,13,t5_2xrpd

10422906,0,t1_dco0yog,Id like to make a slight correction to your tip to stay out of debt...Having debt as long as it is a fixed amount and you are on time and good for it is a great thing. Holding debt that you are good for and that your creditor knows you are good for is insurance for your ass. If you are about to get fucked up for xyz reason but you owe someone a decent amount of money they will probably mention that to the people about to fuck you up if they get word. You cant pay them if you are in the hole the hospital or shipped off to a different prison.Healthy debt is like buying from the store man for a fixed price and owing them say  books of stamps. Then when you pay them off charge another couple of books. Keep a debt going but a perfect credit rating and its quite literally insurance.Obviously dont accept gifts or owe unspoken debts or debts that are not specifically defined before you take them on.,ExCons,dcpi7ls,3,t5_2xrpd
