9758563,0,t1_dafj9sg,Bringing businesses back to usa deregulation and corporate tax cuts will mean more business meaning more tax revenue long term. Coal industrymore tax revenue. Getting america out of bad trade deals saves money. Ceasing the habit of policing for other countries we spend billions on this saves money. Liberals argue that Obama was great for the economy despite the fact that our debt more than doubled by claiming that unemployment has started to decline. You probably dont know shit about the economy give the guy a chance as president before you call people who voted for him fucking idiots and assume that they voted for him soley for the reasons you gave.,ShadowWar,dafymcx,2,t5_3horz

9828834,0,t3_5eyd2l,very possibly?Hmmm....Not sure if it is Soros exactly but it is the liberal left for sure.  They are still fighting the war that is the election unwilling to admit defeat by something so silly as the will of the people.  NO SIR!!Their whole strategy right now revolves around the electoral college and getting Trump to NOT be confirmed as president.  If he is NOT then the congress will decide who takes office.  I know people like to say that this would mean they would vote in Trump as congress is controlled by republicans but I disagree. No way do the SWAMP DWELLERS vote in the swamp drainer. Not going to happen. He wants term limits fer crying out loud!!!  So all Dems would vote against him and many if not most republicans given some political cover which MSM would be glad to provide.So IMO thats the play. To SOMEHOW deny trump the majority at the EC level. It is a common fallacy that one needs  EC votes. That isnt true. He or she just needs a MAJORITY of the votes cast.  So take these recounts as an example. IF any of  these states do not finish their recounts by the fed deadline and some might not then they just cant present a certified EC voting delegation to the EC. The EC on  tallies voted from all the states who SHOW UP with certified delegate totals.The liberalleft play is to use multiple narratives riots faithless electors flipping any shit they can throw at the wall and make stick via MSM lies and combine that with a reduction in Trumps EC votes by making sure some states miss the deadline.  IF enough of this is pulled off and it will be difficult trump will NOT have a majority.Its kinda long odds to all come together enough to overcome his EC total lead but now you see why Trump needed such a landslide to even have a shot and why massive scrutiny was so important in every step of the way even during these recounts. The left will lie cheat and steal and stop at nothing.  SO just to clarify that is the strategy of the libs and why Stein is doing it. Has nothing to do with a money grab.,ShadowWar,daopvv2,1,t5_3horz

9914649,0,t1_dazrix0,Those are good points. I would only add that through whatever the means I would say it is resonable to believe that the US government can mint certificates should they want to do so. As I point out the attack is not likely to be deployed on a wide scale but for targeted attacks against unsophisticated users it is unlikely to be discovered.My point is just meant to show that the CA system is rather broken in its current state for any given user it is likely that it is not tampered with but that is not guaranteed for a strict technical reason but rather for practical reasons.I find your QA is very good and it is not my intention to derail the discussion.,ShadowWar,dazwi1c,1,t5_3horz
