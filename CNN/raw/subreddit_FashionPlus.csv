1127696,0,t3_26ztzh,I honestly wouldnt shop there because at least in mobile not sure what the desktop version looks like the writing over the clothing would drive me nuts not being able to actually see the clothing until I clicked on it and went to its page would be frustrating. Not all of the writing fits in the boxes either some is cut off at the bottom. Id be much likelier to shop there if there were small but full pictures with writing under or next to instead of covering.   Additionally Id really rather have size information before getting my hopes up by the appearance and then finding out on the actual item it wouldnt even fit me. Perhaps a set of buttons to click for clothing that fits each size or a search function with a filter by size option?,FashionPlus,chwh410,2,t5_2td8j

1422897,0,t3_2afu6h,I bought these for few bucks from a thriftstore pretty much on a whim. I got big feet and I rarely find something like this used so I pretty much went fuck it when I realized they fit.However aside from a dress with the same white dots on black pattern I dont actually know what I can wear with shoes like these. I usually just try to buy black shoes so I wont have to think about it  I have no fashion sense . All I know is that i shouldnt wear stripes with these shoes but thats about it PEdit I hope its okay to ask stuff like this here x Ive understood it is but eh never posted here before.,FashionPlus,ciumyv6,5,t5_2td8j
1566217,0,t3_2au6r6,It used to be that fashion was about designing clothes that made women look good.  You usually had your clothes custom made for you prior to ready to wear being the norm.  Women purchased patterns for the largest part of their body then they or a seamstress sewed it then fitted it to the womans shape.  There wasnt all this anxiety about size.People had fewer clothes so they bought quality.  Like one good Sunday dress for church one good winter coat worn for years boots that were worn day in and day out. So quality became very important.Then came fashion and like with food now the designer became a celebrity and their product became an art form.  So they went out and found women with the ideal body shape to market their clothes.  And even among models some outfits dont look that hot on everyone. Models are merely coat hangers.Now clothing is massed produced and the focus isnt on quality.  That is why shit shrinks or doesnt match the size etc. Except youre told its your fault because your hips are too big or you back is to wide  whatever.  They dont bother to admit that the fabric wasnt preshrunk or that they cut one leg going against the grain or that they have zero quality control in their factories.,FashionPlus,cjclkby,2,t5_2td8j
1675192,0,t1_cjq9mu2,I dont know what your hair is like and honestly it will look great no matter what but i could see that dress with an elegantly messy easy low bun maybe to the side a little. You could also go for a high sleek bun with one of those bun shaper things which might actually be easier. ,FashionPlus,cjqbj0h,2,t5_2td8j

2739388,0,t1_cnffh9y,In my experience the size is pretty true amp when it isnt theyre pretty good about mentioning it in the description. The only problem Ive had with them amp sizing is that sometimes the nighties are a little short but I have a long torso anyway so I think thats not on them.,FashionPlus,cnfggdb,2,t5_2td8j
