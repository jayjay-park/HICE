676041,0,t3_21uq7i,Ill play.. I am from North Idaho but went to BSU for  years and my gf still goes to school here..  I drove her back down and am spending the week here.  I just built up a specialized enduro ..  Got it finished up a week ago..  Anyways decided to go for a ride out at the Eagle bike Park.  Second run dropping into the new flow trail I crash hard..  Destroyed my X rear derailleur and destroyed my WTB seat and my carbon hoops are no longer spinning true.  Split my face open and have some major rash on every corner of my body.   All in all it was a pretty eventful. I spent more time driving to and from the bike Park from Boise than I spent riding before I crashed.  ,boisebike,cgh46ya,2,t5_2sfnt
698243,0,t1_cgjmui9,Another good question I dont have the answer for. However maybe I can point you in the right direction. Last summer I did alittle backpacking in the Hells Canyon area near Riggins. Before I went I got a decent topo map on short notice from the guys at The Benchmark on Vista ave. They told me of a place downtown that still prints more detailed maps but I needed a map that day and it being a Saturday the place downtown was not open. Long story short I have no idea where to get the map described in this article. If your looking for a physical map of Idahos backcountry Id suggest calling Benchmark and asking them about it. They are very knowledgable and friendly. Good luck. ,boisebike,cgjn5e5,2,t5_2sfnt
712056,0,t1_cgl7ak4,Here is another good greenbelt route. The pavement on the Garden City side is alot better. I picture doing this in the early morning hours to avoid peds. very few of which I believe would use this section of the Greenbelt.,boisebike,cgl7p82,1,t5_2sfnt
2100442,0,t1_cl6sw4y,Yes There hasnt always been suspension also I have a PWM inline so I can dim it it also can be moved to my full time MTB.  Either way your juvnile remark of hitting someone in the face with a Ulock does nothing but make you sound like a moron and the  following it with a story of me spotlighting you like youre some sort of prey is complete shit and just doesnt make any sense.  Its people like you who give cyclist a bad name hotheaded and overreacting over something as simple as a bright light.  If youd like Ill pm you my commuting route everyday and you can gladly hit me a Ulock and you can test your defense story in court.,boisebike,cl6t91u,2,t5_2sfnt
