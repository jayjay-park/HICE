7308898,0,t3_4aql4f,The starting strength wikia is no more. Hrmph.AnywhoWhen you encounter a fail set retry up to two more times when its time to perform that exercise again. If you cant get x or x for PC and x for deadlift at your weight knock  off and work back up. Increase in increments of lbs then when youre within lbs increase by lbs.I round up the weight to take off on the reset.For example fail at ? Take lbs off. Start back with x at . Then perform    and finally retry . You should be able to push through the plateau.This applies to all the lifts not just the Squat. ,StartingStrength,d28z02g,2,t5_2ttds

10710257,0,t3_5t5ok1,SirIm an SSC.   Hoangdl is right.  Internally rotate your elbows in order to avoid rowing the bar and bending your elbows.  Also slow down a bit and focus on keeping the bar on your legs.  You drag it up just like you do in the deadlift.  Cathc hte bar in a quarter squat.  Thats enough for now.  Send us some more videos on the next session!,StartingStrength,ddkokzp,3,t5_2ttds
10785940,0,t3_5ua89p,Sir  You shouldnt start the powerclean until the deadlift is way ahead of the squat.   You should be eating more food than you have ever eaten in your life.  At  and  you are underweight. You should exceed  grams of protein  grams of carbs  grams of fat AS A MINIMUM DAILY THRESHOLD.   GOMAD might not hurt youIf you are eating properly the deadlift should be going right on up.  I never have anyone do power cleans until at least the third week.   Since you are in your mid s and very underweight without having seen any of your lifts my call is this.  I would not have you powerclean until you weighed  and your deadlift was .  Both conditions would need to be met.  At that time we would discuss your goals and might consider leaving them out all together.  Older folks just dont benefit from them that much.ScottSSC,StartingStrength,ddshpb9,11,t5_2ttds

11268274,0,t3_60tai4,This is an impressive list here.  Nice work.  I would much prefer to do some form checks of your lifts. Post videos here and Im glad to give you the cues YOU need instead of ones you might need.  Additionally you must up your calorie intake. You are a strength athlete now and as such need . Or more calories per day at your body weight.  This the primary cue or directive in concerned about for you.

11586447,0,t3_65d1uq,Someone has been pressing or bench pressing out of that rack.  They can use the end of the safety as a bar hook when it is placed in the rack diagonally.  I love those old racks down there.  If you ever get a chance to make the pilgrimage to WFAC you should. Scott SSC. ,StartingStrength,dg9bxfm,5,t5_2ttds
