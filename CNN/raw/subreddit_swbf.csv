1690153,0,t3_2dpcy9,Id like to see ship interiors. Sort of like the star destroyer map but as a part of a space battle. Sort of like in the alpha footage where they went ground to space and flew into a frigate. As far as a land map. How great would the Geonosis arena be? Think about it. Droid command post are inside those gates where the monsters come out. Clones have to fly in on Gunships. AI Jedi fighting alongside to help against the AI geonosians. The arena beasts could be in there. As well as those little carts you being ridden around. The heros would be Mace Windu and Jango. ,swbf,cjs7hdl,11,t5_2twc4
