9928119,0,t1_db0rqjx,i think you missed the strat completely. This isnt about using the snails to do damage. There is a decal and ive got a premium version that makes any poison damage you take heal you instead. So the idea is to always carry one live snail with you on any run while wearing this decal so when you need an easy heal you can drop it get poisoned pick it back up and get healed up. If you see a large group of enemies ahead you can throw the snail on the ground and have an easy place to run to to get quick regen if things go south so you dont have to worry about needing to drop it midfight. This isnt meant to totally replace all healing items but currently i get about  hp healed per tick and it ticks very fast. ive healed over  health before the poison wears off.,LetItDie,db1nqkw,1,t5_324h4
9929325,0,t1_db1ij5r,No offense but your post is a bit pretentious. Youre talking about something without even really fully understanding the subject as if you have a major in it. Let it Die and the Souls series are very closely related. The combat for both games are extremely similar the core gameplay are both similar and both games even feature very similar core values explore an area and defeat several mini bosses until you defeat the actual boss at the end after defeating  lordsdonswhatever you basically winDemons Souls Dark Souls and Bloodborne are absolutely NOT roguelikes however absolutely nothing about them is randomized except some loot drops. You can do the exact same thing every time and build the exact same character every time and get the exact same gear from the exact same chests every time. In fact theres an entire community around speedrunning specific builds in Dark Souls games because they are so finely tuned for that sort of thing you can find specific weapons in specific places  of the time because nothing changes. That is not a roguelike. Let it Die however is very much a roguelike. You explore a puzzlepiece world where stages are randomly generated from a selection of tiles that you will see repeatedly as you climb the tower. However only specific key stages are not randomized. Those being stages and areas that include bosses usually. FIKEGARA always has the same exact area at the beginning with the trains full of dead fighters but even the loot in that area is randomized. Sometimes you get  chests sometimes you get  frogs sometimes you get a chest a frog and a mushroom etc. Sometimes there are  frogs in the first room with the two Tubers.Anyway you get the point Im making. His post is actually extremely on point. The Souls games and this game are very similar but they are not the same. They ask different things of you and are conquered in very different ways. Dark Souls asks you to memorize stage layouts traps and enemy spawns while Let it Die asks you to level up master your weapons and grind for better gear so you can proceed to the next section and do it again.,LetItDie,db1tect,6,t5_324h4

9977197,0,t1_db81m4j,Oh please did I even make an argument?    This game isnt Dark Souls and honestly it is getting pretty damn tiring hearing that over and over. You dont see people on MH asking for PvP and what not. This game is more in line with MH than DS.    I stand by what I said and maybe reading it a second time will help you understand the statement. There is no difference between CoOp with friendly fire and PvP. If you played Dark Souls  think Mound Maker. A friend could be summoned as a Mound Maker and coop through the level with you. Or you could summon them for PvP. If a friendly can hit another friendly there is little difference than just calling it PvP dueling.    I duel you. I eat a slowshroom and while youre moving  frame for every  frames I move I proceed to dominate you. You eat an invulshroom and are now immune to all damage yay pvp... derp. This game was not designed for PvP action. It was designed that a smart and somewhat lucky player has the power to destroy any annoying thing that comes their way. Some of the things that help with that make PvP and even CoOp bunk.    You want CoOp go play MH or DS. You want PvP go play a PvP game.

Ive played many Nexon FP games and their prices were always fair even The Old Republic had a decent pay option.Id gladly pay  and just own it with the ability to revive on a floor where I entered not where I died giving Death Metals still a greater value with Checkpoints increased storagedeath bag and using the Express Elevator that way Death Metals are still incredibly useful for KC more storage timer skips instarevives etc and theres the opportunity for cosmetic micros as well but Id be angry with myself paying  or more a month for this game As Is. ,LetItDie,dbi89d1,3,t5_324h4
10058922,0,t1_dbi297w,Tetris comes from a time very different than the one we are in now relations between countries arent the only thing that makes this a special case that probably wont ever happen again. Tetris is art to me because it grasped a level of game design that all the art games boast in todays age. A direct connection and understanding of whats being communicated to a players brain and playing off of the reaction. The respect that most other pieces earn is from that interaction with emotion but tetris shouldnt be overlooked its a dedication to form. Its why it sold more than the harry potter book franchise and the lord of the rings one. Its cross the planet more than mario and was immune to the many changes of age. Theres a reason it struck pop culture harder than bejeweled style phone puzzlers who debatably strike the same place in your head. Its because they realized that Tetris was a critical hit to the social structures of the mind. Its a first step anyone can take to break that boundary of living a life and playing a game. I know its just a puzzle game solving and being rewarded but I debate here that its literally hypnotic. And the fact the owners realized this in thier continual recreation of the game to this day is why I feel as though its a piece of art. Do you know the only way for someone whos been playing for a while to get bored of tetris? You have to mentally contemplate a step a head and ignore the achievement. Otherwise your stuck in the loop. Dont get me wrong failure can be what you contemplated just as much as getting bored of clearing lines. But the key is you dont get bored of clearing a line until youve accomplished something bigger. And this craft has given tetris an air of respect lacking from other games that leaves it immune to the scrutiny they face. Because nobody scoffs at a release of tetris even though outside the modes stacked on top its a repush of the same game. Something that Call of Duty among many other games gets reprimanded for year after year. The idea is both games give your brain a satisfactory feeling but what COD attaches to is considered easier to become stale. Cods conversion of value in cash is much larger it leaves the game in a sense it doesnt with tetris. The only other game that holds such unique qualities over such time is Chess. Back before we had a computer to run the other side of a game it always had to be a person whether its for experiences like Dungeons and dragons or the mathematical ones like Chess and tetris. They fit the same front. Both of these games also have public communal understanding that they effect your mind the many strategies of chess shared around the world and the tetris effect. Its because it was coded by an artificial intelligence programmer nobody is going to have a better connection to the synapses of your brain.  Its a staple of the industry that still lives on not fading out and its because of a simple truth of the industry that can hurt any dev hoping to spread what he creates across the lands. The small segment of attention that Tetris takes is all a human in todays age is willing to give out before you have to hit his walls of personal issue and bais. And so thats all the attention each successful variation of tetris hopes to achieve. Weve been trying to break that wall for quite some time the idea is the the majority of the games you mentioned live off of assumptions of the industry. The controller you use the time period your playing in the screen it is on. Shadow of the colossus is one of my all time favorite experiences but I comprehend I had to learn to communicate with a controller before immersion was allowed. Tetris as a concept has gone past all that sure out of its simplicity but I believe that is our fault not Tetriss its the same reason Chess never got beat out by an updated Chess . . VR is the current goal as it has the chances of breaking all thats required to get someone past what a video game is and straight into living it loving it. Many games have played off that boundary its pretty much Hideo Kojimas signature in my opinion to show you all the steps required for immersion. The thing about people who grew up with tetris Nobody remembers the controller they played on the screen they just contemplate tetris as a whole. Tetris was somebody making a Mold out of the portion of our mind that enjoys sorting. Anyways thats a random writeup Love your list happy that none of them through me for a loop. Its just that you have to accept that list would really get bad ratings if you just when person to person. Fuck I love Zeno Clash but I know that the majority of people simply vomit over it. And for good reason its the problem with boasting a virtual world realization of the edges leads to a more important reality. Most of those games ask for a sense of immersion thats completely on the players shoulders. Ands its not like how seeing a painting requires eyes its more like if you seated yourself badly in a movie theatre it can ruin your experience. Theres that gap the game industry has to experience whats considered art at least art in gameplay like I assumed was the matching theme to your list tetris skips that.  The Mona Lisa is a recreation of the Human form in such a way that anyone can see its relevance Tetris holds the feeling of satisfaction just like that smile. But its just the smile floating their own its own we have charted out a chunk of the rest of humanity and hope that strapping goggles to our face lets us go the rest of the way. Oh and all these concepts I spoke of are technically being used for evil today on the phone market. As for my indie stuff I have a lot going on that I rarely ever share but as of right now Im making my own home console out of a scrap laptop with a custom linux setup I have an agreement with a local shop dealer to set it up there. Its my personal poor ass way of having a huge QA staff. And my goal as a developerat least in this age is to release a game that works as a bridge between the consoles by creating a game that shares content between players regardless of where and how they play like how the passwords of old games worked but integrated through generation so that theres a reason to share and not just look it all up. ,LetItDie,dbip9zk,1,t5_324h4

10173098,0,t3_5lnzv5,Im still on F but i like to take my time with games and i only play on weekends. Heres what i do with haters ALWAYS carry an iron for parry. Melee haters do zero damage and i dont underestimate them. I always attack after the parry or if they are in a corner. I always onetwo the combos because the third or last hit always has a recovery time where a hater with a fast weapon will hit you back.AlWAYS peek around the corners and listen to sounds. You want to see the hater before he sees you and you always want to identify if its a melee or a firearm hes packing. If its a gun know which corner you will hide behind and lure him into melee range before you let him see you.ALWAYS know your rage levels and the rage cost of the weapons you have and use any weapons that can knock them down. Knock down stomp butterfly knife makes the stomp a stab with very good damage and when hes getting up knock them down again. This is pretty obvious but use mushrooms. Make up your own combos with them that flow into another opportunity to attack. Last but not least use common sense. If you see a hater busy with a  screamer let them fight and wait for the right moment. Right now i just got the sniper rifle to a level where the aim doesnt move and i can get headshots and thats what i do from a distance. It crits plus it dazes them for a bit drops them down before they get to you. One bullet per hater goes a long way.,LetItDie,dbx6dg3,4,t5_324h4

10337360,0,t1_dcfr2k7,You see. here is the thing. With the cloak and Guard shroom an attacker still has to bring a decent set up to break down a decent defense. Example as this happened to me a while back. I see a target he has like k Lithium up for grabs and is high plat. So i take a half durability Saber full Armour as i always do and  Cloak shrooms. I use both the cloak Shrooms yet the guys gear is so good i could only manage to take the st guy down and had to bail. IMO this was the fair outcome. I went in with next to no prep and effort vs a well defended room and this guy spent like at least k on each defenders gear and was rewarded for it. Now imagine i just went in with  Noeffortshrooms and a k NailgunI go in Eat the Noeffortshroom Tap tap tap Goretastic DEAD. Tap tap tap Goretsatic Dead and so on.This is just simply a broken mechanic. This game has been all about grinding and preparation.

Thank you for sharing I have no idea how to use Twitter so I definitely never wouldve seen that otherwise.However while the language is telling but Im pretty sure Twitter is also run by CMs so I cant really take himher calling it a balance concern as definitive of intentional design. EDIT also just wanted to make it clear Im stoked theyve at least sent it on to the dev team I was half convinced they werent even aware of it beforeHell to go off topic again feel free to just not read the rest of this its basically just a blog post if I were to consider this an intentional balancing decision which again it may well be Id lean toward bugaccident but I aint the dev I cant say it would be silly for yet another reason I havent brought up yet.  Growth  Let it Die was released to us with the intent that further floors would eventually be released assuming finalform weapons or at least most of them are meant to be fragile useful only for a much more limited time than prior tiers would be much more literal about finalform than you would expect given that new floors are coming.However it might fit with a more...  removed design.  Like the updated content is another  floors and they just start with an entirely new set of materials instead of building on top of the  floors we have already.  So tier  materials would forever be rare instead of just being the standard for .  Would certainly make those of us that were obsessed enough to upgrade a Jackal weaponScythe maintain that special status though Id hope theyd have an upgrade that would elevate them into a good state.,LetItDie,dddvbwl,1,t5_324h4

You have to wait an hour for him to have materials replenished that you purchased from him. Youre best off searching every possible spawn until youve found him go do other things for an hour and probably visit the Waiting Room again then start tracking him down again.It can be a big pain but if you keep checking spawn locations for his shop you will eventually find him.And dont forget you can get MILK Black Metals from Gold Chests so those are a good thing to hit up while youre waiting for him to restock.
