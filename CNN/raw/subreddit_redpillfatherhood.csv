6253904,0,t3_3vy5tv,I would expect my gay some to be no different than a straight version of my son in all aspects of his life other than his relationships.  Id still expect him to be the best version of himself he can be and to challenge himself to be the best at what he does.  And Id expect him to find a worthy mate that will only make him better and not hold him back.  If that mate happens to have a penis so be it! ,redpillfatherhood,cz0i1pd,1,t5_39c29
7406210,0,t3_4gq0ys,This is a great post.  Lots of really good advice in here and nice to see when so many OPs seem to find their children to be just one more chore they have to attend to. I really enjoyed being in a house with four children each one different from the others.  Its crucial to always be in control of your emotions when interacting with your children even though it is sometimes difficult to accept their what we think are limitations when our ambitions for them are so large.  My wife and I made a concerted choice that we would not climb on board the clean your room train and focus on other priorities instead. We just kept their doors closed lol.Screaming isnt an effective way to communicate with anyone most especially your children. We used to always joke this is just a stage...we will soon be on to something much worse.,redpillfatherhood,d2k1d7l,2,t5_39c29
8348089,0,t1_d5kav0a,It is fun isnt it?  Ive become much more relaxed with my wifes shit tests by passing the shit tests from my kids especially my daughter.  Whoever said boys are rambunctious and out of control never had a daughter.  Man she somehow knows how to throw tantrums give the silent treatment be manipulative etc. already.And see my comment about how you really are a helicopter parent at least in this food area.,redpillfatherhood,d5l2bcd,2,t5_39c29
10658142,0,t1_ddfajom,I have become a believer over time that the only thing one can control is oneself.  I cannot control others and ifwhen I do it seldom works out to be what I wanted to achieve.  Often others will respond to our own changes and for better or worse it is what it is.  The idea of therapy to improve oneself only is a product of this thinking.  Then the therapy and the results are not potentially skewed by outside therapeutic influences of trying to work together to solve a problem.  You get to own it all yet control no one except yourself.,redpillfatherhood,ddfb0u2,1,t5_39c29
