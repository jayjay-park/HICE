25707,0,t1_cehc0wl,Yes youre probably right. I wanted to leave the problem as open as possible but I was interested in a solution that is a function of the tiles size. For example if the tiles size is a few millimeters it wont be necessary to know anything about the path velocity etc. since we got pretty much a good approximation of the shape of the feet.But as the tiles size increases I guess theres a point where more information is needed... and nevertheless I think that maybe an statistical analysis could give an approximation. At every moment theres one or two feet in the ground. One foot changes position randomly and goes no further than one yard away of the other. Does the devil need to know when MJ gives a step? Or he could get the approximation only by looking at the tiles ging on and off? These are the kind of things I wonder...And another thing the area of the lighten tiles will be always bigger than the area of the feet. How could we get a better approximation then?,learnmath,cehcy0r,1,t5_2rdi4

571738,0,t3_20o60w,Looking at the insides of the absolute values and recalling the definition of absolute value we see there are  cases to check there is overlap in some of our cases but we can ignore that right now. The cases have to do with when we can drop the absolute value bars on the quantity inside. For instance if xgt then |x| is just x |x| is just x and |x| happens to just be x which follows since xgt whenever xgt. Thus we can drop the absolute value bars and just solve the equation for x when xgt. Now another case is x which satisfies the inequality when plugged in. By doing this we have checked for intersections for all x values larger than or equal to  so we still have the case xlt to check. I would split this into cases depending on where the of the inside quantities flip. For example the inside of |x| is x which flips signs at x so you want to consider ltxlt as a separate case. Similarly |x| has x on the inside which flips sign when x or when x but notice that we handled that case at the very beginning I did this since if xgt then all the absolute values are taken on positive quantities so we can drop the absolute values. Also we see the inside of |x| changes sign when x or when x so the interval ltxlt should also be checked separately. That leaves checking x x and xlt as the remaining cases once the two intervals above have been checked. For an example of what to do in the other cases we tackle the interval ltxlt. Here xgt so |x|x and |x|x. What about |x|? Since xlt we see that xlt or xlt. But then by the definition of absolute value |x| must be equal to x. Then we can plug these in above to get x  x    xand this we solve for x if possible. That will handle the case when ltxlt. Is it clear how to proceed from here? Drawing pictures is usually quite helpful as well. I would include a number line with the special values we noted of x x x. This cuts up the number line into pieces that we evaluate the absolute values over.,learnmath,cg59fbz,2,t5_2rdi4

We dont need to factor it to determine if  if the matrix is definite semidefinite or indefinite.  We can just try some values.  At  the polynomial is negative.  At  positive.  At  negative.

745112,0,t3_22ow1f,Here is a copy of my answer from when this came up beforeGeometrical intuitionThe derivative is the slope of fx if you plot it on a graph. But more generally its just the rate of change of something. If fx is the distance something has travelled with respect to time then fx is its speed. If fx is the amount of water in a bucket at time x then fx is the rate at which water is being added in e.g. litres per second. If fx is the height of a curve above a straight line then fx is the rate at which the curve moves away from the straight line... also known as the curves slope!So if gx is the area under a curve from c to x i.e. the definite integral of f then gx is the rate of increase in the area as x increases. If you look at which happens as you move the right endpoint to the right slightly youll notice that the area under f is increasing at a rate that depends on the size of f. Putting the last two sentences together you get gxfx.More formal explanation This is closer to the proofRemember if you want to do the opposite of a sequence of steps then you need to do the opposite of each step in the reverse order. For example to undo putting something in a box and taping it up you need to take the tape off first.Differentiation is subtracting fx from fy where y is near to x then dividing by something small yx in fact. Integration is multiplying by something small dx then adding up these things. The operations are opposite in the opposite order.,learnmath,cgoz4rd,9,t5_2rdi4

765947,0,t3_22xgj5,In order to put the equation into the form ab you need to get that square root out of the denominator. You can get rid of the square root by multiplying the number by its conjugate. surds often come in pairs where one is abc and the other is abc. If you multiply a conjugate pair together you will get a rational number. In this case the conjugate of  is . Multiplying these together gives  using the difference of two squares in reverse. However as you have changed the denominator you must adjust the numerator to keep the fraction the same by multiplying that by  as well. This gives . to get a and b divide this by the denominator to get a b.Multiplying top and bottom by  is the same as multiplying the fraction by  as they can cancel but it gets the square root out of the denominator which makes the surd easier to deal with.,learnmath,cgrcdku,1,t5_2rdi4

So take an element inampnbspS and multiply it by the scalarampnbsp you get the zero vector. Therefore S contains the zero vector.And of course if you prove that S contains the zero vector then youve proved that it is nonempty.So they are equivalent. It doesnt matter which one you prove. I chose to say that the first criterion is that S is nonempty because it allows you more freedomyou dont have to prove specifically that S contains the zero vector if it is easier to prove instead that S contains some other element. But usually the vector whose membership inampnbspS is easiest to prove is the zero vector anyway so it doesnt matter.,learnmath,cgu1wwc,3,t5_2rdi4

Similarly for the second equation t  t  t  t  t  t   for every real t.As soon as you change one of those s on the right to anything else then this property does not necessarily hold but something similar does if you have a vector v which is a solution to the system and a vector w which is a solution to the homogeneous version of that system ie replace the numbers on the right with s then if t is any scalar v  tw is a solution to the original system.This has to do with the fact that matrices are linear operators ie if you have a matrix A representing a system of equations vectors x and y and a scalar a then Aax  y  aAx  Ay the matrix A commutes with vector addition and scalar multiplication.

1471328,0,t1_cj0ol37,First ProblemYou are correct on it being a circle of radius . However graph what this function x will look like. If that doesnt make sense let me try to help. Remember that square root functions will only give you the positive yvalues. So rather than taking the area of a circle with radius     and then dividing by two which will give you half of a circle you are instead looking only for the positive y values from x to . So instead of half of a circle youre looking for a quarter!Second ProblemFirst take a step back and remember what exactly an integral is. If we have a rectangle bounded by the lines y y x and x I assume you could easily figure out the area base x height. Now instead of taking the area in one fell swoop we could cut up the rectangle into thin rectangles with height of  and width of h and then add the areas of each of those rectangles. Make sense so far? Well now imagine you had a curvy line on top rather than a straight y like say yx. Suddenly those rectangles are only an approximation.However we can fix this with the power of limits. As with the little rectangles in the bigger rectangle just slice your new shape into vertical slices with width h and add them up. However now you need your width so small that the rectangularyness of the slices is virtually insignificant and is more of a onedimensional line. How do we do this? By taking the limit of our sum as h is approaching  and the number of slices being added approaches infinity. Thats all an integral is! A sum of an infinite number of slices of a shape with individual widths of zero.Now in our example we had the integral of yx from x to x. From the fundamental theorem of calculus we know that fbfaintegralfx from a to b. In other words our integral would be the integral of x from  to  which is equivalent to . The area of that shape would be .So you have and integral from pi to... pi! Imagine you made your floor a coordinate plane. Now imagine a line directly in front of you off to infinity. This is your xaxis. If you are standing at x and moved to x you would have moved  units along the xaxis. Now imagine you are at xpi and were told to move to xpi. Well you are already there! Job done! How far did you go?  units! So if you have an integral whose bounds are the same number that area would be  no matter the function!I hope this helps.

Hence the falsity of Q implies the falsity of P.Now we have shown thatP gt Q implies Q gt Pwhere  means not. Replacing P with Q and Q with P we getQ gt P implies P gt Qbut cancelling the double negations shows that the converse holds.Often an author will jump straight into a proof by contraposition without mentioning it so its good to remember that an implication is equivalent to its contrapositive.,learnmath,ckwu6u1,1,t5_2rdi4

2218130,0,t3_2khqha,The theme of functoriality crops up all over in mathematics Every vectorspace has a related dual space. If you have a linear map between two vectorspaces you can lift that map to one that goes between the dual spaces. In terms of matrices this is the transpose. If you have a topological space with a distinguished point you can generate a group called the fundamental group. A continuous map that preserves the distinguished point can then be lifted to a group homomorphism between the two fundamental spaces. A differentiable manifold with a distinguished point has a tangent space associated at that point. A differentiable map between manifolds can be lifted to a linear map between those tangent spaces.  Given a set you can generate a formal vectorspace where the elements of the set make up a basis. A function between two sets will give rise to a linear map between those formal vectorspaces.To formalize functoriality we define categories. The categoryviewpoint says that functions between things are just as important as the things themselves. Instead of equations you typically use commutative diagrams to show which combinations of morphisms are equal. A functor then allows you to transport commutative diagrams from one category into another.It then puts a smile on your face to see that functors end up becoming the morphisms between categories. This gives you the category of small categories.Probably the most important functors are the socalled hom functors. Hom stands for homomorphism. Take a category and objects A and B in that category. Then HomA B is the set of morphisms from A to B. It turns out that Hom is also a functor. Actually a bifunctor  its a contravariant functor in its first argument and a covariant functor in its second. Often a good way to learn about an object A is to see what HomA  and Hom A look like. I forget the standard examples but I know Awodeys book mentions in the category of boolean algebras think the lattice of subsets of a set S you become very interested in maps into the boolean algebra of the subsets of  .Equality is a fishy thing in category theory. Objects defined in terms of universal properties are only defined up to isomorphism. Isomorphism is like a weak version of equality. It becomes very natural to start looking at where our equalities are stronger than we would like.For instance you can find examples of functors which look suspiciously like Hom functors. But Hom always gives you a set of morphisms in the category of sets. It might be the case that a functor gives you a set that is merely isomorphic to a set of morphisms. We really would like to treat two functors as being equivalent.So the natural thing to do is this construct a category whose objects are all functors. Then we need a suitable notion of morphism which we call natural transformations.One viewpoint that you can take of functors that is sometimes helpful to understand the definition of a natural transformations. For a functor F  C  D take C to be a category with finitely many objects and arrows. Then F can be visualized as a diagram in D. Even if C is an arbitrary category the functor F ends up being an infinitely large diagram. Then we define a natrual transformation   F  G in a way which allows you to walk through the diagram but any any point you may jump to the image of  which is another diagram in D of the same shape. No matter what path you take and when you make this jump the results have to be the same.Categories of functors seem pretty abstract but theres a reason we like to work with them the magical Yoneda lemma. The Yoneda lemma takes a category and gives you back a category of functors. That is each object A in the original category is assigned to the functor HomA  and for each morphism f  A  B you get Homf . The Yoneda lemma acts like a completion much like the algebraic closure of a field or compactification of a topological space. Even if your category is anemic the Yoneda embedding will endow it will all kinds of useful properties. In particular the resulting category will be have all limits and all colimits. It is also a topos a setlike category.,learnmath,clls06p,3,t5_2rdi4

Not a rectangle.And that certainly isnt true for any delta. The question is asking you to find a delta. Which delta works? Once you find the delta the proof is trivial. Certainly for example if X is the real line and delta is  that ball around  certainly wont be N x  will it? Find the delta that works for the case of the reals draw a picture if you have to then notice that the same solution will work for any metric space. No I dont think theres any need to tell you what it is. If you understand what I wrote in my argument above coming up with an actual number should not be an issue.

2490385,0,t3_2o45kh,the easiest way to get a handle on vector spaces is to first think of the familiar ndimensional Euclidean space Rn .  Rn is an example of a finite dimensional vector space and vector space can be thought of as a generalization of Rn . this generalization reduces a vector space into a set X with an associated field F usually R or C that satisfies certain conditions.  namely closure under vector addition xy in X gt xy in X closure under scalar multiplication x in X a in F gt ax in Xall the usual properties of addition and multiplication apply to the vector addition and scalar multiplication.subspace of a vector space can be thought of as a smaller vector space that is contained in the original vector space.  so going back to the Rn example R Rn Rn are all subspaces and so is any hyperplane that contains the origin.  it should be noted that the null set is not considered a subspace.  in general subspace V is a subset of X such that  is in V closed under vector addition closed under scalar multiplebasis can be thought of as set of vectors that defines a vector space.  so in the Rn example or lets be a little more concrete in the plane R    or what we think of as the xaxis and yaxis are an example of a basis.  but so is   .  basically basis are any set of linearly independent set of vectors B such that any x in X can be expressed as a linear combination of those vectors in B.  set of all linear combinations of B is called the span of B and is written spanB.  if you dont know what linear combination or linear independence is you should look them up.  they are very important concepts.  basic idea is that every element in X can be expressed as vector addition of the vectors in B each scaled by some amount.  as an example in R using  and  as a basis you can express any point xy as x  y.  but you can also do this with say  and  as xy  yx.  point being basis arent unique.   but you cant do this with say  and  because they are linearly dependent  is just .   you might ask at this point does every vector space have a basis?  in finite dimensions the answer is obviously yes since you can always take .... ... ... etc. as your basis.  once you get into infinite dimensions answer isnt so obvious.  but somewhat surprisingly if you accept axiom of choice the answer is yes.  every vector space has a hamel basis i.e. a linearly independent subset B of vector space X where each x in X is in the span of finitely many bi in B.  hamel basis are natural extension of basis in finite dimensions.  but its really more abstract notion of existence than any thing concretely useful and in fact in infinite dimensions every hamel basis is uncountable.  but some spaces can admit different more useful basis like schauder basis for some but not all separable spaces.  hope this helps.,learnmath,cmjmqwh,0,t5_2rdi4

2494652,0,t3_2o45kh,A  vector space is full of stuff you can add together and scale by numbers. A subspace is a subset of this stuff that can also be added together and scaled. When we say can be added together we mean they can be combined together to form a new vector and this vector is also in the set of stuff that the first two were from.This means if we have a vector space then if we only have a handful of stuff we can generate new stuff by adding together the stuff we already have. A basis is a generating set you can use to make all the stuff. Bases are special because they are the smallest generating set you can use. The largest generating set is the entire space itself which might contain lots and lots of stuff! But a finite dimensional vector space always has a finite basis in fact the size of the basis is used to define the dimension of the vector space.,learnmath,cmk6tih,1,t5_2rdi4

3591670,0,t3_31hqgc,Differentiating an expression with respect to x means thinking of the expression as a function of x so that x is the only variable and other things are either constants or functions of x themselves... and then differentiating of course.So when you have an equation like y  x  you can imagine the set of all points xy that satisfy it. Typically this will be some sort of curve in the plane. It might not be possible to solve this equation for y in terms of x. Visually you might have two points on the curve that have the same xcoordinate. Or it might just be algebraically difficult. In my example this is because when you take the square root you need to consider both the positive and negative possibilities. Either way the value of y depends on x even if it is not uniquely determined by x.So when you perform implicit differentiation on the equation y  x  you can think of y as depending on x at least locally like a function. So it may help conceptually for you to write fx instead of y. That is when you perform implicit differentiation on the equation the lefthand side becomesddx y   ddx fx    fx f  x   y dydx.Does this help?Edit And if this wasnt clear already the idea is a generalization of the fact that fx  gx implies f  x  g  x.,learnmath,cq1oey8,3,t5_2rdi4

You have to use the compactness theorem which says that if every finite fragment of a theory is consistent then the theory is consistent. We know that ThN is consistent because it has a model the standard model.The idea is to expand the language of arithmetic with a new constant symbol. Then you can take ThN and add in statements in this new language to get a new theory T and use the compactness theorem to show that its consistent that is show that any finite subset of T is consistent. Then you can get a model M in this expanded language and if you forget about the constant symbol it should be clear that M is a model of ThN.

Also the entire field of Ramsey theory is based on pigeonholeeque properties. gt Cant we take it for granted?As much as you can take for granted any true observation. The proof of pigeonhole is usually not worth writing down formally it may state depending on how you want to state it that any function from n to m where m lt n is not injective and you can prove something like that formally if you wish.

3659032,0,t3_32a34i,The gradient is a vector of partial derivatives. So why are derivatives defined on open sets?It all boils down to our choice when we make definitions. Its not forced upon us by some logical law to choose that definition for a derivative. For example continuity is often seen defined on closed intervals. In fact it is quite accepted that sqrtx is continuous on inf so we ignore the negative real axis for continuity but its conventially only said to be differentiable on  inf. So we have no compunction in using onesided limits for continuity but shy away from doing so for derivatives. So why do we restrict our definition of the derivative to open sets? Its because it fits our intuition of what a rate of change should do derivative gives intuitive results only if it has points in all directions around it in the complex or real plane.For example lets use the epsilon delta definition to analyse derivatives defined on a dense nonopen set. The function fxRgt R defined by fx  x if x is in Q and fx   if x is not in Q is differentiable nowhere the only possible derivative for  to try are  and  and both fail and continuous only at  so its not differentiable elsewhere too. But suddenly if we restrict the domain to just Q it has derivative  everywhere on Q since for all points q in Q sufficient q close to c in Q but not c fq fc  qc  qcqc and this is just  no matter how close we get to c.Another example using just intervals would be fx  x and gx x. Then clearly if defined on R for every point in R they do not have the same derivative at that point. But if restricted to just the interval    they can have any derivative they want at  if we dont define the derivative on open sets only since the set of points in the domain  close to  but not  is empty for any delta it vacuously satisfies the condition that the quotient is close enough to any derivative we set.I guess the intuition didnt make sense here so they defined it only on open sets where we just say that the function restricted to Q and  above doesnt have a conventionally defined derivative because Q and  are not open.,learnmath,cq9cskf,1,t5_2rdi4

In Mathematics I might be talking about a dimensional hypersphere I cant observe or research a dimensional hypersphere physically so through careful thinking and generalisation I can find that the relation between a circle and a sphere is the same as a sphere and a hypersphere thus if we apply the same methods we use to describe a circle to now describe an ndimensional circle we can now discuss a hypersphere.In Physics when Im speaking about a star with L luminosity and x distance from the star I can then through careful observation and research find that those two are inversely linked such that Lx   Generalising as in Maths isnt always helpful because the theory has to be the same as the observation in Physics.I could list more examples for Chemistry and Biology but it comes down to that Mathematics is definitely very much abstract.I think you have never broached real Mathematics when you say I would plug one input into an equation generate an output repeat. about maths.Richard Feynman on the relationship between Mathematics and Physics.,learnmath,cr8yp4x,2,t5_2rdi4

If the calculator you use wont be changing and its giving you correct results when you do this Id say theres nothing wrong with doing it that way.gtWhat if I have the two side but need to know the angle? How do I do the math then?Then you have to either know certain values of trigfunctions or more generally use an inverse trigfunction. This often involves memorizing or having a mnemonic for the unit circle as seen here For each of the listed angles the pair of numbers give you the cosine and sine of that angle. So for example this image says that coso   and that sino  .If youre only ever using your trigonometry for triangles you can restrict yourself to looking at the top half of the circle the lower half are angles that cant possibly show up inside of a triangle.Putting this to use you want to find the angle for which cosA  . First reduce the fraction to  because    so this is cosA  . Going back to the unit circle we see that the angles for which cosA   are o and o. Since this has to be an angle inside a triangle we conclude A  o.If youre concerned about memorizing the unit circle check out the responses to this recent questionNow that may be all thats necessary for your course but if you end up needing to find an angle for which say cosine gives a value not on that list you need an alternative method. You may for example need to find A for which cosA  . To do these more general problems youll need the inverse trig functions. Most calculators that can compute trig functions can also compute the inverse functions often by pressing something like a nd button and then using the regular trig buttons. For example your sin button might have something like sin printed above it on the calculator this means that the buttons default action is to find the sine but its secondary function is to find the inverse sine. So if you entered  pressed nd and then pressed cos it should give you back an answer of  because thats the angle for which cosine gives .,learnmath,cr9ygdz,1,t5_2rdi4

There is nothing in mathematics that we do simply because. There is always a reason behind everything we do if we look deep enough. The easiest way to explain to most people why we require common denominators to add fractions is to think about the denominators as being what kind of thing were dealing with and the numerators as being how many of those things we have. It then becomes obvious that we cant add  and  because we are attempting to add two things of different types together very much like adding unlike terms together.

5389155,0,t3_3ot0p0,Big O notation is used to measure efficiency of algorithms. Important thing to note is evaluating these are particular n is usually meaningless.The Big O in these tables measures the rough number of comparisons that need to be performed in each sort. Big O simplifies exact numbers to just degrees. For example an algorithm may take n  n comparisons at n this means    comparisons obviously the n term is larger here but for n this becomes    and the n dominates for this reason we consider n to be the important and call our algorithm On .The reasoning for this is that for small input sizes algorithms are fast anyway we only care about how they scale to large problems. This is obviously not true in many cases for example an algorithm that n  n that runs on things that are generally n lt  for example students in a classroom is not really going to be entirely determined by the n term. Its also for this reason that you dont ever try to determine reallife performance by only Big O complexity.The way these are calculated are basically by counting the operations the algorithm does when run on a input of size n. Also as a simplification we only count a particular type of operation usually the most expensive which in these cases are comparisons. So there are entire operations that we dont even consider when calculating the actual ncomplexity which we simplify to Big O another reason not to take these at face value.,learnmath,cw0iwwp,1,t5_2rdi4

Warning Im going to write something super pedantic because I dont know what sort of detail you are expected to produce.First it sounds like were assuming the definition of a path is a list of edges. So well do structural induction on this list. Note that any list L is either. the empty list or a single element x put on the front of another list L.In the former case we write L  EMPTY. In the latter case we write L  x  L.Theorem for any nonempty path a which is a path from x to y there exists an edge xw and a path b from w to y such that a  xw  b.Proof by structural induction on the nonempty list of edges a. Note that we assume a is nonempty therefore it suffices to use the singleton list as the base case.Base Case  Suppose a  st  EMPTY meaning that a is a list containing a single element namely st. Since we know a forms a path from x to y we know s  x and t  y. Therefore a  xy  EMPTY.Let w  y and b  EMPTY. Clearly a  xw  b. Furthermore b is a path from w to y since w  y. That concludes this case.Inductive Case Suppose a  sw  a meaning that a is a list consisting of the first element sw followed by the remaining list a. Since a forms a path from x to y we know that. s  x and  a is a path from w to y.Therefore we have a  xw  b where b  a is a path from w to y as we were supposed to show. QED.Now the reason why I say this isnt a good example of induction is because we didnt have to use the inductive hypothesis. Really the entire proof just looks like thisa is nonempty and therefore can be written a  xw  b. Since a forms a path from x to y we know that b is a path from w to y.

To go from one side to the other it has to cross the x axis. Sometimes it might just touch the x axis and not cross think xSo you solve for these boundary points. Thats just using the quadratic equation on your case.There are a few outcomes you get two answers you get one answer or you get no real solution a pair of imaginary numbersIn the first case you have two boundary points. You just need to determine if your solution is inside those or outside  in other words you know that between your two roots r and r F is either all greater than or all less than  and the opposite outside that region. You can pretty quickly figure out which. Then your answer is either xgtr and xltr or xltr or xgtrIn the second case theres only one place where Fx crosses . Once again you have to determine if F is positive or negative on each side. For a quadratic itll be either positive on both or negative on both. If your solution is xr then your answer is one of a xgtr b xltr c x!r or d no solution. For quadratic F like yours only c and d are possible but if you think back to simpler linear inequalities they can only do a or bFinally if there are no real solutions for x that means F never cruises the boundary which means either all x wish or none.,learnmath,cx3wosq,1,t5_2rdi4

I could sit down and rederive it in  minutes though if I needed to.So first and foremost you need to disavow yourself of the idea that getting better at math means learning lots of rules.  In fact of all the fields out there math demands the least amount of memorization.  In principle you only need to know the basic rules of logic and a few axioms to uncover all these facts you previously felt the need to memorize.Obviously people take a middle ground in practice but I would start by figuring out how to synthesize what you know into more general principles that can apply to a wide range of situations and not worrying so much about memorizing every last detail.  Its hard to recommend specifics since we dont know the exact nature of your current approach.An example of something youre struggling with or that you felt was impossibly beyond you would be helpful if you do want more specific feedback.,learnmath,cx8ht30,2,t5_2rdi4

5947202,0,t1_cxz6aux,OK now that Ive fixed the typos Ive identified at least let me try to answer this.Im not actually factoring anything. Instead Im using the inequalities to separate out the original squaresofsums into two separate sums. In other words my idea is to first take the RMS of the set T  left a  fraca a  fraca cdots an  fracan right. Thatll then give me information about the AM of the same set. But now that we no longer have all those messy squares I can use the expression I get about the AM of T to express it in terms of the AM and HM of A  left a a cdots an right which in turn will let me compare your original sum to Sn  a  a  cdots  an. In the first line above I simply note an identity your given lefthand sum is simply n times the square of the RMS of T. The RMS of T is greater than or equal to the AM of T so we get rid of the squares and the square root sign. Further we can then separate the AM of T into the AM of A plus the reciprocal of the HM of A. And since HMAAMA HMAAMA.By way of some afterthefact motivation the ultimate goal is to show that the lefthand side is greater than or equal to some expression involving Sn. But since by definition mathrmAM A  fracSnn text and thus  fracmathrmAM A  fracnSn this suggests that we ought to think of the righthand side of the inequality youre trying to establish in terms of the arithmetic mean of A. And we can get to the AM of A via your known inequalities.Hope this helps clarify things. Good luck!,learnmath,cxz7igq,2,t5_2rdi4

6339985,0,t1_cza96wi,Here are the key ideas  Two consecutive elements of the fibonacci sequence are enough to recreate the entire sequence. If I told you F and F then you find F by adding them then you can find F by adding F and F and so on. And you can also go backwards  find F by subtracting F  F and so on.This also holds mod n for any n because the fibonacci sequence is defined by addition and addition works nicely mod n namely a mod n  b mod n  a  b mod n. You just do the same process adding the consecutive numbers to go forward and subtracting them to go backwards doing it all mod n.But since the entire sequence is defined by two consecutive elements if you find the SAME two consecutive elements somewhere then the sequence must be the same in both directions out of them. Using concrete numbers if for example F   and F   and also F   and F   then we have F  F   and F  F  . Now we can conclude F  F  F       mod nAnd F  F  F       mod n.These calculations are exactly the same. So it must be that F  F. And F  F and so on. And going backwards via subtraction F  F and F  F and so on. For all values of j Fj  Fj  . In other words the sequence is periodic. Incidentally this has a nameRepeating because weve found the same pair of consecutive elements the sequence out of them in both directions must be identical because the fibonacci sequence is completely determined by two consecutive elements including if we take it mod n. The punch line then is because the fibonacci sequence contains a  namely F   and since for any n    mod n this  will appear in the fibonacci sequence mod n infinitely many times. That corresponds to the infinitely many fibonacci elements divisible by n.,learnmath,czaaav3,2,t5_2rdi4

Going backwards we havex   gt x     good so farx     gt sqrtx     nope this one is false!In your proof however you can plug in x  c  ba into the original equation which would show existence.

A parabola has a focus which is not a quadraticpolynomial yet  but some geometric object.  A parabola is defined as the set of all point equal distance from a point the focus and a line the directrix.  When we try to write this definition algebraically withxys and the pythagorean distance it simplifies down to some translation of xsquared.So could we create some geometric object with a focus a point we keep distance from that would algebraically simplify to a nonquadratic polynomial?  Maybe like the product of the distance is constant?  Possibly.  I dont think so.  Im not sure.   Distances euclidean distances anyway are inherently quadratic but it might be fun to try.Even if we found one the answer still might be no.  Parabolas are in a class of objects called conic sections which also include circle elipses and hyperbolas.  All of these can be described as sets of points that are some distance from a point points or point and line.  They are also all quadratic in x y or both.  They also can be visualized as slices of a cone.  The focus and directrix have meaning in relation to that cone.  So if we used a different geometric context would the points still be called focii?I dont think I have answered your question.   But now I have question.

You can get used textbooks pretty cheaply at a Goodwill or a used bookstore or maybe even for free if you ask your friends or your friends parents. Start with really basic stuff and and start at the beginning of the book and keep going until youve finished the book or gotten bored with the subject. Theres no shame in boredom. Then get another book and repeat the process. Exactly which books you get is not too important the important thing is to get started. The advantage of buying books is that you can write in them and you dont have to take them back to a library.

And ideally we would like to know this in a way that doesnt beg the question.One way which requires heavier technology that the standard tools of calculus is to note that the discriminant of x  a is a. When a is zero we obviously have one root x   with multiplicity . When a is nonzero this is negative and that is only possible if there is a pair of conjugate nonreal roots. The third root is real as we know from the fundamental theorem of algebra which tells us that a real polynomial of odd degree has a real root.

8025593,0,t3_4p57m5,Just to emphasize this from another users commentgt Step  check if she is genuinely interested. You dont want to worsen anxieties. Be inviting but dont dive in too heavily. Its easy to lose sight of when you understand something so fluently but the other party doesnt.But anyway I have some recommendations.First dont use any math texts at all. There will be a strong association between textbooks and school and while so much can be gained from a good textbook  most textbooks arent good and  you can do a lot of math without one.In fact you can do a lot of math without pencil and paper too. Explore mental math with her. There are so many good exciting things you can do with basic arithmetic that people lose sight of when they get to high school. Here are a few good onesWhat is     ? You might instinctively reach for pen and paper. But mental math wont have that. How would you approach this problem if you were only able to use your brain?Heres the strategy we give. Think of the much easier problem       . Then think to yourself How much extra did I add? You added three s more than you should have so you can simply subtract that from  for your answer.For high schoolers who have their times tables memorized we like to pull this question on our new students What is  x ? Most students can answer reflexively  x   . Good. But then what is  x ? Again no paper allowed.Again we have a strategy. Not a sophisticated one but a basic one that is often lost on people when they go through school. The idea is that the multiplication  x  means How much is twelve s? Having this memorized gives us a starting point. So when asked  x  we should think How much is thirteen s? Well since thats just one more  we can take our  and just add an extra  on top. So while we dont have it memorized it only requires a moments thought to add  and  to get the answer.Another good trick that people can become proficient with given some practice is squaring two digit numbers in their head. Im only mediocre at this myself but there are a number of good videos on YouTube that explain the strategies. Here is one to get started with.Take an afternoon to calculate all the squares from  to . Organize them into columns     etc. Then take some time without any further instruction to find patterns in the digits. There are many! Just to give one example take any number in the s. We are going to square it. The result will be a fourdigit numbers    . The first two digits are given by taking the ones place of the original number and adding that to . The last two digits are given by taking the ones place of the original number and squaring it.So if I want to know  I look at the ones place . I add  to  to get . So      . Then I take that same  and square it to get . So       or just . With some practice I can square any s number almost instantaneously. But thats just for s. Every group of  has its own trick. And while I gave that one as an example it is even more exciting to discover these tricks for yourself. Some are harder to find than others! There are lots of things you can do even with the basics of math.,learnmath,d4i5hbv,5,t5_2rdi4

If they were able to fully replace their first food with the second food repeat  until you run out of money or theres no way to get more enjoyment.So still not great but better.Then next thing to consider is making the enjoyment function for each food nonconstant. Consider if I have no steak getting just one steak might make me much happier. But if I already have  steaks getting one more probably has a smaller effect on my happiness. And if all I have is steak switching some of it out for a bit of corn might make me happier.So for this I would propose you assign each food a happiness function of the form constant   you already have at least to start.You can add more complexity as you see fit For example theres might be some enjoyment value to excess calories regardless of where they came from but you should get a reasonably interesting starting model from just that.,learnmath,d54sof6,1,t5_2rdi4

8692909,0,t1_d6rja1y,An asymptote is just a straight line that your function can never reach. Its like the speed of light  you might get close theoretically of course but youll never really get there.For the function previously given fx  x it is impossible for that value to ever reach zero because as you increase the value of x the resulting yvalue output from the function gets smaller and smaller. A limit is simply that concept taken to infinity i.e. what happens when you say fx  infinity ? Except you cant actually say infinity because infinity isnt a number you can use its a concept. So what a limit is in calculus is a method of formally specifying a number that you can use but is arbitrarily close to the chosen value.Basically you cant reach zero in that function but you can get as close as you like to zero by picking a large value of x. Thats what a limit is.Warning useful but not entirely correct analogy followsAs an analogy imagine you run a factory and need to build a part within a certain tolerance. You are allowed to deviate within  th of a mm in sizethicknesswhatever so you need to determine how long to run the system to get the part to within that tolerance. Think of that time as an input value into a function that tells the machine how long to run. You get to pick the value you want you just need to know what value you need to get it to within that range but once you know that you can pick any valid valid. Thats sortakinda like finding a limit. You need fx  x to get within th of zero? Pick at least x  . Need it within th? Pick at least x  . Etc.The point is you can get arbitrarily close and still have a valid number whereas with infinity you cant work with it at all because it isnt a number.,learnmath,d6s8rd3,2,t5_2rdi4

8928064,0,t3_52klzo,Yeah there is some confusion here. First off you started by defining S   but you also seem to be defining S as the set shown in the linked image. We must decide!Instead lets say I is the interval  and S is some arbitrary sequence of numbers from I represented in binary.  The image you linked is only one possible example of how S might look undoubtedly your professor just made it up at random.Note that a sequence like S represents a function from N to I. You give me a natural number n and I will give you a real number namely the nth number in that sequence.The set of items in the sequence S is a subset of I but as we will prove it cant be equal to I. Because I can always find a real number from I which is not in the sequence. How? I generate a new real number by taking the first digit of the first number the second digit from the second number the third digit from the third number etc. Then I flip all the digits s become s s become s. The resulting number is not anywhere in the sequence for instance it cannot be the the second number in the sequence because the second digit is different! And once again the point of this is that S is totally arbitrary. No matter what sequence you start with you can always find an element of I that is not in it. That is no matter what functionfrom N to I you might create it cannot possibly be a bijection. There is no bijection from N to I.Now Ive glossed over some details here. Most notably the fact that a single number can have two different decimal representations or in this case two different binary representations for instance .  ..... So what if the number we created actually is in the sequence S its just represented by a different string of digits? We actually have to tweak our proof a little to get around this problem. It sounds like your professor covered that issue but the crucial thing is to understand the basic thrust of the argument. ,learnmath,d7l0skv,1,t5_2rdi4

9105631,0,t3_54zet0,To add a bit of clarification since these things werent explained to me at all way back in school either this is really just a matter of notation and definition. There are no exponents in real life it is just a convenient notation used to express the idea of repeated multiplication. Mathematicians also needed a way to easily express how to deal with the common operation of taking the inverse of a number raised to a power and chose to use the negative exponent notation because it is elegant.So fundamentally the answer is because its defined to work that way and it was defined to work that way because it was convenient to define it to work that way.This is a pretty common thing to do. You may or may not be familiar with functions and inverse functions where fx is a function and f x is its inverse but not fx ! That is because when it comes to functions the negative exponent notation is explicitly defined to mean something else.When you deal with trig a bit later youll see twists in notation too where the square of sinx is not sinx but sin x which is shorthanded to sin x. Because it was deemed easier and more elegant to deal with.,learnmath,d86cmxn,3,t5_2rdi4

If you want a good demo of this phenomenon graph the graph of a function f is x fx over all real numbers x e.g. the graph of a linear function is a line any function on a graphing tool like desmos or geogebra in either type in something like fxx and it will graph it automatically and zoom in really far on one point. Unless your example is terrible it will look flat once youre close enough. Its usually prooflight at best theres also real analysis one of the most basic goals of which is to make all that stuff rigorous. Calc shows up in a lot of weird places like optimization make this as bigsmall as possible given these constraints and physics. If youve heard of number theory which investigates among other things the prime numbers a good chunk of modern research in number theory is in the subfield of analytic number theory as opposed to algebraic number theory which uses lots of analytical tools and thus calc so calc is probably used in cryptography which is generally based on number theoryAnyways after algebra III from which you should take away graphs polynomials rational functions and asymptotes at least most people do some geo if they havent but I find that a waste of time. Some geo courses are set up to be where people encounter the notion of a proof which is valuable but its really the main point of value in the course. Besides that there is precalculus which is a hodgepodge of topics meant to get students comfortable with the most common nonpolynomial functions that show up in calculus the trig functions sincostancotseccsc and explog. Again this isnt that valuable. Youll need to understand those functions at some point before moving on but if you get them a fullblown course is unnecessary. Depending on the course precal may also include limits summationproduct notation and very rarely I believe sequencesseries. If you see limits theyll get used in calc but they arent all that common in the sense you learn in precal AFAIK the only other subject that ever uses that definition is real analysis but I dont know how common it is there and at that point you might as well use the topological definition which is more intuitive and general theres an even more general definition but its awfully rare to see and pretty unintuitive. The rest you can probably learn in a day or two.So after precal is calc I usually. After calc I there are a few good ways to go. One option is to do calc IIIII multivariable calc and vector fields? maybe? I never took that sort of class which is pretty much the most that nonSTEM majors do in school. Its like calc but more so. Here you primarily ask why did we use fxaxb as our quintessential nice function? What about fxyaxbyc? and find out what happens.Alternatively if you feel done with calc you can continue in a few different ways. Theres differential equations which is like algebra but now with derivatives and integrals stuff from calc running amok which makes things much harder. AFAIK again never took this its generally taught as a grabbag of techniques which isnt as interesting as the general theory and may or may not require calc IIIII regardless Id suggest you take the next option first which makes a lot of this stuff clearer. That next option is linear algebra. Unlike calc IIIIIdiff eq if you want do science or math you will need this. Comp Sci uses it for graphics or machine learning physics in quantum mechanics math all over the damn place etc. Unfortunately theres a big gap between the for math majors level and the for everyone else level. The former is usually fairly theoretical and will cover most students first abstractions an abstraction is something abstract some students will encounter sets first but anything else is less common. In this kind of linear algebra students learn what a field is and what vector spaces over fields are and then examine linear transformations between them which is where the name comes from their matrix representations and eigenvectorseigenvalues. In contrast a nonmajor linear course usually drops fields and does everything over R simplifies linear transformations to matrices and then introduces a variety of ways to interact with matrices computationally. From here you could take modernabstract algebra which IMO is one of the coolest subjects. Its the algebra in algebraic number theory the reason theres no formula in terms of radicals for the roots of a quintic the reason the cube root of  is not constructible in euclidean geometry the theory of the Rubiks cube and so much more.The third option is statistics another I never took. I dislike most concrete subjects and this is pretty much the most concrete one of all so Im not going to talk about it.The final option is discrete math which I never took. This is a good way to learn about proofs if you havent already and the course often discusses a hodgepodge of other useful topics generally including modular arithmetic combinatorics and set theory and logic. The first two are valuable tools across the board the third is not that useful and better learned in a fullblown course on the subject. In any case discrete is generally easy so I might suggest not doing it in full and looking up a summary of modular arithmetic and combinatorics instead.,learnmath,d8bhfc8,2,t5_2rdi4

9196330,0,t3_56ai2r,I noticed that you used the Law of Cosines to solve for AC where generally one would use a specific form of it called the Pythagorean Theorem.A right angle is an angle that measures  degrees.  A right triangle is a triangle that has a right angle.  The side of the triangle that lies opposite the right angle in this case side AC is called the hypotenuse of the triangle.  The sides of a right triangle that arent the hypotenuse are the legs of the triangle.The Pythagorean Theorem then states that the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the legs.  If for some right triangle the length of the hypotenuse is c and the lengths of the legs are a and b then the Pythagorean Theorem states that c  a  b.With the Pythagorean Theorem since triangle ABC has a right angle and since AC is the hypotenuse of the triangle we may conclude that AC  AB  BC.  Equivalently AC  AB  BC.One thing of note is that since angle ABC is a right angle and since angle CDE is a right angle then AB and DE are parallel.  Since AB and DE are parallel then triangle ABC and triangle CDE are similar triangles.  Since the triangles are similar Corresponding angles will be equal     CAB  CED     ACB  ECD Corresponding sides will be proportional to each other     ABDE  BCCD  ACCESince ABDE  BCCD then by multiplying both sides by DE and dividing both sides by BC ABBC  DECD.Similarly since angle DCF is a right angle and since angle CDE is a right angle then CF and DE are parallel.  Since CF and DE are parallel then triangle BCF and triangle BDE are similar triangles.  Since the triangles are similar Corresponding angles will be equal     BED  BFC     CBF  DBE Corresponding sides will be proportional to each other     BCBD  BFBE  CFDESince ABBC  DECD then ABCD  BCDE.  Since CFDE  BCBD then BCDE  BDCF.  Then ABCD  BDCF.  Since BD  BC  CD then ABCD  BC  CDCF  BCCF  CDCF.  Grouping all terms with CD together we get ABCD  CDCF  BCCF.  Through distribution we know that CDAB  CF  BCCF.  Thus by dividing through with AB  CF we conclude that CD  BCCFAB  CF.But wait!  We know AB BC and CF so we can just plug those in and calculate CD directly.Similarly we can solve for AB and assume we know CD.  The steps will be largely the same until we reach the step where ABCD  BC  CDCF.  From there we just divide by CD to get AB  BC  CDCFCD which can be expanded as AB  BCCF  CDCFCD and simplified as AB  BCCFCD  CF.,learnmath,d8hpaxt,3,t5_2rdi4

9255203,0,t3_575hyr,gt I understand that a derivative is a function that can tell you the slope at any point of the original function but I dont really know why. Im not really sure what more to tell you but it might help to think of the derivative as the rateofchange of the original function at each point. You have probably been taught that you can approximate the derivative like this    fx  fxdelta  fx  deltaWhere delta is just a really small number. In the numerator were looking at how the outcome of the function often called y changes when we change the input x a little bit to xdelta. And then we divide by how much we changed the input because the more we change it the more change we should expect in the output. So in other words this is the change in outcome divided by the change in input. Deltad is often used to indicate changedifference so this changes to dydx. The d here is definitely special. It is not just some variable that were multiplying it says to look at the differencechange of something. And here y may be replaced with any other function of x in which case we might get dfxdx or dxdx etc. However it is often more convenient to write this as ddx fx or ddx x. ddx is typically best seen as an operator that takes the derivative. But in some cases you can do a little bit of algebra. For instance dzdy dydx  dzdx. See e.g. here for some explanations of why you cant typically use it as a ratio.,learnmath,d8p5whe,7,t5_2rdi4

9363027,0,t3_58rti3,There is no continuous real function h gt  such that h is invertible so we need to find two invertible functions and a procedure that replicates the joint distribution Fxy. If the couple XY is dependent i.e. Fxx  Fyy not equal to Fxyxy  you need to first simulate X and then simulate Y|X or first simulate Y and then X|Y. You cant simulate X and Y independently using their marginal distribution since they are not independent. It wont yield the correct distribution that way. And we cant sample directly from Fxy using the inverse transform because of what I said above. So the distribution functions needed are Fx and Fx|y or Fy and Fy|x and their respective inverse or other suitable techniques to sample from their distributions.Lets choose Fx et Fy|x.We have FxX   X  X for ltXlt.To find the inverse we must do a square completionFxX    X     Therefore X  sqrtU     keeping only the positive root since we want  lt X lt  So we simulate X  Fx UWe now find Fy|x fy|xY|x  fxYfx  xYxFy|xY|x  integralsYx  sxds xY  Y x   xY  Y x x  Y  x  x  square completitionTherefore Y|Xx  sqrtx  U  x   x and again we only keep the positive root because we want ltY|Xxlt. While X and Y are dependent U and U are however independent. You thus generate the couple UU from Unif  use Uu to compute x  Fx u and then use this value of X to compute Y|Xx  Fy|x U.The inverse transform is just one way to sample random variables there are others such as the acceptancerejection method for example.

But perhaps more easily to explain using it would allow you to say that the natural numbers has fewer elements than itself.For exampleConsider two copies of the natural numbers copy A and copy B.  Then you can create a bijection from every natural number n in the copy A to the number n in copy B.  Thus all numbers and all even numbers in B have the same cardinality.  But after that there are still all the odd numbers in B thus B has more elements than A does.Two things have the same cardinality if a bijection exists.  It doesnt require that every map or even the most obvious map is a bijection just that there is one out there somewhere.  If you want to show that two things have different cardinalities you have to show that its completely impossible for one to biject to the other which isnt particularly easy.,learnmath,da6m713,7,t5_2rdi4

10051227,0,t3_5jngoj,bluebrown essense of linear algebra is definitely worth your undivided attention. Its not that long hour or .As someone who has done engineering but is entering the math world and was new to the proof writing starting with logic proofs and induction is good. Also working from a system of axioms is good you should be able to prove things like x  x where on the LHS you are multiplying a real number by the addidive inverse of  and on the RHS you have the additive inverse of real number x. This is not an axiom it is derived from the field axioms.As for linear algebra just understand what a matrix is. Its a linear transformation. Then you have all these things rank column space nullility etc and these have definitions but you should be able to just look at really easy ones and pick off the data For example the identity matrix of size n x n has rank n.Practice practice practice. From my experience know what you know and know what you dont. Know what tools you need to answer a question.  In a very simple case if there was a question is the following matrix A invertible? If it is invert it and you had only paper and pencil to do it could you do it? Take that approach with intimidating problems and over time the number of things on the course syllabus that intimidate you will shrink. Thats just my view of course.,learnmath,dbhp7x6,11,t5_2rdi4

That building is  feet tall information is key information to this problem.As an extreme example suppose a question on a test was whats the sum? No other text or anything there. It just says Question . Whats the sum?. You dont have any numbers to add. People would be confused they wouldnt know what the question wanted. What do I do pick  random numbers like  and . and add them? Do I write I cannot answer this?. The best I could do with a question like that would be The sum of a and b is the unique number c associated with elements a and b by the addition operation such that abc. But even then that might not be what the question was asking what if it was a sum of  numbers instead of just a and b? Basically you need enough information to answer questions arithmetically.

The number would be more because it would include all of the previously allowed passwords and then some still it does round up to   is approximately ..The reason those numbers are so close is that there are so few passwords that dont have at least one of each category no uppercase letter or no lowercase  about . less than a tenth of  no digit  about . no special character  about .Youll need to use the InclusionExclusion Principle after working out how many passwords have only two or only one of each category of symbol to figure out how many are allowed but after looking at this Im not sure how they got approximately  allowable passwords under the old rules.Actually I got about . passwords allowed under the original rules.In practical passwordcracking as you can see just knowing that these particular rules are enforced reduces the password space massively and knowing how people would usually follow the rules like starting with a capital letter ending with digits and using digits and particular special characters as l pk substitutions for lowercase letters provides the most effective path for passwordcracking however as you guessed without rules like use one character from each category way too many people would use alldigits or ordinary words or even the same character repeated and those patterns are even easier to start with when performing bruteforce cracking.,learnmath,dccu6z9,1,t5_2rdi4

10334881,0,t3_5nyzqn,Assuming you mean thisgt The complement of the universal set is the null set  and the complement of the null set is the universal set.Then make sure you understand first that the universal set is the total collection of all possible values under consideration. For example if you are dealing with humans then the universal set could be all humans alive on Earth or something like that. The null set then is simply the set which contains no elements. Informally the complement of a set is essentially the opposite of the set in a sense so the opposite of all humans alive on Earth would be a set containing no humans i.e. the empty null set. And the opposite of a set containing no humans would be the set containing all humans. Etc.More formally the complement of a set A denoted Ac  is the set of all values in U that are not in A. If A  U then the statement is that Uc is the set of all values in U that are not in U. There clearly are no values in U that are also not in U and since Uc is defined to be such a set then Uc must be empty. There is only one set by definition that contains no elements the null set denoted  so then Uc must be the null set.Formally  Ac   x  U | x  A You should be able to see from the notation that the complement of the null set is therefore the set of all values in U that are not in the null set. Since there are no values in the null set then the complement of the null set must contain all values in U because there are no values in U to take away. This means the complement of the null set is equal to U.Something else to understand A set is completely determined by its definition and after it is defined any set of values that fits that definition is therefore able to be called that set. So the null set is defined to have no elements and the universal set is defined to have all possible elements. To say something is equal to the null set is to say it is the null set and to say something is equal to the universal set is to say it is the universal set. This is a fundamental concept to grasp when dealing with mathematical objects and their definitions.Note also that when it comes to the null set any statement of the form x   will always be false because there are no values in  that can make the statement x   true  i.e. the truth set of x   is the null set. Conversely since the universal set contains all possible values under consideration the statement x  U will always be true no matter what x is. This is because x is only allowed to take on values from the universal set U so regardless of what value x is it will always be an element of U i.e. x  U and so the truth set of x  U is the universal set itself.Understanding what truth sets are makes it clearer also what is meant by saying statements such as x Px are vacuously true  there is no statement in the truth set  that can make Px false and since it can never be made false it must be always true. This is a subtle tricky thing to grasp when first learning set theory.,learnmath,dcfiluy,1,t5_2rdi4

10999692,0,t1_deerf9t,What youre describing is essentially statistical inference. This is really a whole field of mathematics in its own right but a typical question is something like given samples from a probability distribution where the parameters are unknown how can you estimate those parameters?In the case of a coin flipping experiment suppose that you dont know the probability of a not necessarily fair coin coming up heads but that someone gives you the results of  flips how do you estimate the probability of getting heads? Taking the probability to be the proportion of heads in the experiment is a reasonable way of doing it.But there are very natural followup questions too. For example the coin could be fair but maybe you get  heads in your experiment. So the most reasonable estimate for the probability p of heads might be p. but can you reasonably say that p is definitely not .? To answer questions like these statisticians use tools like confidence intervals. These are ranges of possible parameter values which the parameter is very likely to fall into given the observed data. In the hypothetical example I gave above a confidence interval for p might be something like . . in other words there is a  chance that p lies between . and .. In a case like this even if the most likely estimate for p is not . it would be unreasonable to say with any confidence that the true value of p is not ..Theres a lot more to go into there hypothesis testing pvalues different statistical tests Bayesian vs. frequentist approach all of it very interesting but too much for one comment.

11209529,0,t1_df282m9,Okay cool. So your question is then     logfracxx  logxx  logxsqrtx    solve for  x Now. I spent about an hour solving a variant of this problem to try to show you how it worked. Thats my standard practice. Solve something like the problem but not actually the problem. Heres what I learned. Normally you can tweak a variable and get a slightly and I emphasize slightly uglier result when youre done. Maybe its an odd fraction or whatever doesnt usually cause a ruckus.Well this problem isnt like that. This appears near as I can tell to be the only thing that looks anything like this that in any way results in something nice. Normally thatd mean Id have to resort to guiding you through the problem which is much harder but it turns out that this kind of question is fucking bullshit. Its a classic example of a problem that makes people hate math. Its designed to make whoever assigned it feel really smart for having the book to tell them how to solve it knowing what to do to solve it and does basically shitall to teach you the thing that they should be aiming to teach you in algebra which is how to do math. Heres what it is trying to saygt To do math identify complicated things and use arithmetic to mechanically turn them into a collection of simpler things.That right there is how all math is done. From basic arithmetic to the most complicated theory on the cutting edge math is about making complicated things simple by doing stuff to them.Rant over heres the worked problemStart by applying changeofbase everywhere change of base is     logb x  fracln xln b Doing that gets us to     fracln xln fracx   fracln xln x   fracln sqrtxln x  So weve turned complicated bases into twice as many simple natural logarithms thats mathematics. Lets do it again heres a useful fact  sqrtx  xfrac  and another useful fact     ln xy  y ln x So we can make those complicated logsofweirdthings into     frac ln xln fracx   frac ln xln x   fracfrac ln xln x   rightarrow       fracln xln fracx   frac ln xln x   frac ln xln x   Alright now the most complicated thing is the logs with coefficients theres a nice identity for that too     ln xy  ln x  ln y  and so  ln fracxy  ln x fracy  ln xy  ln x  ln y  ln x  ln y That gives      fracln xlnx  ln   frac ln xln x  ln    frac ln xln x  ln    Now the most complicated thing is  ln x  but its hard to simplify that but we can force it with a clever trick. Lets let  k  ln x  and then just solve this like an algebra problem well just have to remember to undo that at the end.      frackk  ln   frackk  ln   frackk  ln    You know what I noticed?  ln  ln  ln  lets go ahead and let  b  ln   thatll make the whole thing a bit simpler to read      frackk  b  frackk  b   frackk  b   The most complicated thing? Probably the fractions lets multiply everything out to get rid of the denominators since the RHS is  we can just ignore it while we multiply everything out      kkbkb  kkbkb  kkbkb   Expand it     k  bk  bk  bk  bk  k  bk  k   Collect terms and simplify     k  bk  bk   Now we can start rootfinding. First if we factor out the common  k  that means we know one solution is  k  and it leaves us with a quadratic to solve      k  bk  b   Quadratic Formula! Ill leave the details of that to you the roots work out to      k  fracb  and  k  b So. Now we have to find  x  thats just a matter of solving these three equations individually more simpler things!     k   rightarrow ln x   rightarrow x  e   One down     k  b rightarrow ln x  ln  rightarrow x   Oh yah one more     k  fracb  ...     ln x  fracln  ...     x  efracln   eln efrac  efrac Fuck this problem but thats definitely the root.Hopefully that helps you understand the approach. You should in no way feel bad for this feeling hard. It is hard. Pointlessly hard. This is a shitty problem you can tell because it was trying to teach a lesson which was much better taught by simply stating the point of the lesson  turn hard things into lots of littler less hard things.I hope the rest of your homework is less shitty.    ,learnmath,df2l5mx,3,t5_2rdi4

Being able to factor solve and graph quadratics do polynomial operations evaluate functions determine domain and range of functions and solve linear systems of equations are all great SKILLS. Those are all things I expect my Algebra  students to do.    unorelevantcomments mentioned rational functions. Its a topic you can look into but not necessary for Algebra  anymore. I agree that if you ever come across something that you dont know you sound like you have the willingness to figure it out and learn on your own.    My recommendation is to talk with your parents and counselor about skipping Algebra . It sounds like you can DO everything you need to but there is a big push in math education to require students to critically think and do more than just compute simplify etc. Things that dont involve rote memory. Just something to think about if you really do want to skip Algebra .    Here are a couple of recommended course selections for high school th grade to th grade if you can continue working hard to understand your math courses.    Geometry or honors gt Algebra II or Trig Honors gt PreCalc gt AP Calc AB or BC    Geometry or honors gt Algebra II or Trig Honors gt AP Calc AB gt AP Statistics or any other higher math course offered    Id recommend AP Statistics to be taken for sure! not necessarily the sequence I suggested with it It can be taken any time after Algebra II or even at the same time if youre willing to challenge yourself and the school allows it. Colleges like to see a rigorous course schedule. Rigor has many definitions for different colleges so dont assume it just means difficult.    I hope this is useful for you!

11617865,0,t3_65rxvl,One crazy interpretation is to study the relationship between logic and arithmetic through which there are two ways to arrive here. First notice that many of the rules for logic and arithmetic are the same if you pretend A and B is A  B and A or B is A  B. As an example    A and B or C  A and B or A and C    A   B  C   A  B  A  CThen we will ask why the empty sum A   is zero and the empty multiplication A   is The empty sum logically is an extension of arbitrary sums. The statement A or B or C means you have to prove one of ABC. The statement A or B means you have to prove one of AB. The statement A means you have to prove one of A. The empty or means you have to prove one of  which you cant so the empty sum is False . This is why in programming any   False in every language. The logic for the empty product is similar. A and B requires you to prove everything in the set AB. A requires you to prove everything in the set A. The empty and requires you to prove everything in  which seems easy so and   True. Another way involves adding that exponentiation is similar to logical implication if you pretend that B  A is similar to if A then B. For instance    if A or B then C  if A then C and if B then C    C  A  B  C  A  C  BThen when examining A   we can examine if False then A. But the statement if False the A is always true! So we write another pair of statements    if False then A  True    A    But this isnt quite a real proof at best we could convince ourselves that A    . The full logic might look like    if False then A  if False then B     This translates to x    y      if A then True  True     This translates to   x  We now have that      and x    y   so x    y    ,learnmath,dgcw8t1,1,t5_2rdi4
