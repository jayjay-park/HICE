2876707,0,t1_cnut9vw,It would be nice if for regular blocks and conduits the rotate buttons changed the colour a little bit. ,infinifactory_roadmap,cnv2zvu,4,t5_34jfg
2877187,0,t3_2t078z,Im not all that far in yet but is there a pause block like in SpaceChem?  It could work just like the sensor block but pause the game as a block passes it the first time.  It would make it easier to fast forward to a particular spot so you can monitor an event.,infinifactory_roadmap,cnv4ytz,9,t5_34jfg
2909632,0,t1_cnut2yy,I actually prefer proper exclusive fullscreen mode  Nvidia Shadowplay works more consistently with exclusive fullscreen and Ive tended to get better performance in exclusive mode.,infinifactory_roadmap,cnytzdo,1,t5_34jfg
2931042,0,t1_cnwpjb7,I like this idea. The armed shuttle level made me fastforward ten times before I could get the positioning of the lifters and pushers right.,infinifactory_roadmap,co19ro5,1,t5_34jfg
