When I prepare a dish it usually contains dog kibble wet dog food and a mouse. We add some cooked sweet potatocarrots sometimes blueberries blackberries and apple chunks. They also love scrambled egg. However those are all adult foxes. The young one might need special nutrients that my meal prep does not account for. Definitely look online to find advice from people who have raised them from young. Good luck!,foxes,crsdjdc,13,t5_2qont

6649212,0,t1_d070p7w,Im not trying to force a label on Culpeo but when someone has a tradionally furry alias and makes tradionally furry art theyre effectively a furry artist whether they label themselves as a furry or not. And furry artists often have trouble distinguising their drawings of one type of animal from their drawings of another type of animal. Thats my point. Culpeos already representing the different color schemes but it would be nice to see different body types. ,foxes,d0733yd,6,t5_2qont
6654928,0,t1_d0733yd,Given that this was done many years ago I wouldnt argue that its his best work and I wouldnt even disagree with you on the point of the similarities in style or that many of his pieces are anthropomorphistic in fact Id argue that this is undeniable. However I would also argue that Culpeo was once a young artist who has grown and continues to grow as all artist do and if he were to revisit this piece he would have a much easier time recognizing and representing foxes in their various forms.... if being Furry is a conical term for inexperienced artists to you I feel you should revise it.

10144102,0,t1_dbtlbme,Thanks so much for the information. I didnt know that before about Arkansas. Im from the Seattle area so im pretty sure having one here is illegal or frowned upon. Plus my neighbor has chickens so...yeah little tasty treats running around wouldnt be the best while having a fox around. hehe. ,foxes,dbts3q6,2,t5_2qont

Asking someone to change the way they live without understanding their circumstances is not reasonable.What if we were talking about patterns of behavior that hurt other people  could we ask people who did those sort of things to change their behavior? Lets use robbing people as an example.gt If youd like to give advice thats great. But no matter how wellfounded your argument you have to accept that not everyone has the same values or priorities.Presumably you wouldnt think it was acceptable to allow someone to keep on robbing other people because the robber just has their own set of values and priorities.Would you think it was valid if someone used a similar argument to defend killing foxes for fur or wearing fur?,foxes,dcf1dpy,1,t5_2qont
10331008,0,t1_dcf1dpy,gt Would you think it was valid if someone used a similar argument to defend killing foxes for fur or wearing fur?Noone is going to debate that people robbing one another is a suitable basis for a sustainable society. In case youve misunderstood I am not arguing that you should be polite to people wearing a fox fur coat. Im arguing that if you want someone to make a change in the way they live their life  i.e. become vegetarian  you should do so respectfully.There is in most countries around world a set of laws that clearly state that robbing people is not OK. This is something we as a societyies have agreed on to the point that is has been instated in criminal law. Whether or not we should be vegetarian or vegan is not  so I think that applying the same logic is a bit of a stretch.My main point though is that when you go into a discussion with someone and your aim is to change their mind theres no point in them even talking to you if you start from the assumption that your point of view is correct.If you do not have enough respect for someone to consider that there is a chance however small that they are right and that by extension you are wrong then why should they show respect to you and listen  or take you seriously?Why would I discuss vegetarianism with someone who had already made a judgment about me based on the choices that I make? Its hardly level ground to start from and as a result its very difficult to find common ground in such cases.Its like when people knock of your door and ask you to convert to their religion. From their point of view youre gonna go to hell and they are trying to save your soul. Which is fine  they are entitled to their beliefs. But if they expect me to listen to them telling me about how Im gonna burn you can expect me to take it with a grain of salt at the very least.Long story short robbing people is someone we can all agree on is bad. Eating meat on the other hand is not something we all agree on. So going into a discussion with the assumption that you have the right of it  and your goal being to change their mind  is just rude.No matter how strongly you feel the evidence weighs in your case you dont have the right to make their decisions for them. Especially if they happen to be some random you met on a forum.gt Of course thats true but one can generally make certain assumptions about people with the free time to post on reddit.Which ones exactly? How many of the people you talk to on Reddit do you actually know  really know? Unless you have a very solid basis for making these assumptions I would avoid making any at all.Edit sorry if this is a little garbled its quite late here and Im about to go to sleep. I just feel strongly about treating people with respect if you expect them to listen to you  and not assuming that you know what its like to be someone else because put simply youre not.,foxes,dcf2sod,1,t5_2qont
