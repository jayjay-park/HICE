4290514,0,t3_39qyrs, Hypermobility does tend to run in families both loose joints and several actual conditions.  If its possible you might want to look into a diagnosis or at least be aware of some of the other things that can be part of hypermobility syndromes. For instance when I was  before I even knew what hypermobility was I found out that local anesthetic sometimes doesnt work as well or at all sometimes on people with hypermobility.  I found this out when a an ER doc was cleaning and suturing the lacerations on my arm and I felt it.  The doctor just kept insisting it was all in my head because I was watching I was staring at the wall and I had to just suck it up.  Everyone else Ive dealt with has been fine about giving me a bit extra and topping me off when it starts to wear off.Its also good to keep an eye on stuff and not assume its just hypermobility because some of the symptoms of hypermobility like joint pain and fatigue are symptoms for a ton of other conditions as well.  So at the very least learn your baseline and know when something is different so you can see a doctor.,Hypermobility,cs99gkf,2,t5_2xaog
