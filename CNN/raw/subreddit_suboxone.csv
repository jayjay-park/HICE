1150714,0,t3_2741o2,I disagree.  My doctor is only interested in the  dollars he gets from me a month.  Ive been seeing him for almost  years now and he still doesnt even know my name without looking at the folder.  He has said many times that he feels like Suboxone is a medication that people can take for the rest of their lives....and I dont think that is right.   He literally sees  patients AN HOUR.  Its not about getting people better...its all about the cash money hes making.   no offense taken.  I know that Im not adhering to the plan that he has for me.  I dont know if Id go as far as saying im abusing the medication but I admit that Im not doing what he think I am doing.  In the end I know my body better than he does and I feel like Im better capable of determining what dose I should be at than he can.  Honestly the doctor is nothing more than a mobile pharmacy to me and everyone else that sees him.   Sobriety is all about change and getting into a new groove.  If I followed this doctors plan for me I would still be taking Suboxone  years from now,suboxone,chz2i9j,1,t5_2t4ye

3056291,0,t3_2v63ap,Sounds like bs to me. The only thing youll get mixing those drugs is a big bowl of precipitated withdrawal. Even if you were lucky enough not to get pwds the sub would block both the dope and the methadone from working at all. Dunno why they would say that as it is not the truth at all. ,suboxone,coes6dy,2,t5_2t4ye

He doesnt tell me much when I bring this up he just says youre not going to withdrawal. Is he just BSing me or what? ,suboxone,crizjns,0,t5_2t4ye

4910629,0,t3_3hvtzz,I was in a pretty strict program and you HAD to drop dirty I remember we had a girl come in that was trying to stay clean and was getting Subs of the St so she decided to join our program and get it legit. She dropped and she only had subs in her system and the Dr told her NOPE Our Counselor was SOOOO PISSED it was obvious she was trying to kick.... so she said F it and went got some dope got high came back and got put on the subs..... The system sucks some times.....,suboxone,cudisgw,1,t5_2t4ye
5500581,0,t1_cwec46j,Thank you this is good to hear. I understand the . mg per taper. Ive read that in many sites its crazy how such a small amount can keep a hold on you.  No wonders people are on this for life in cases. I usually take mine  x daily. In the morning when wake up its  the worst  sometime b or during work and a few hours b sleep. Even if my sleep sucks at least I get some  the only reason I didnt take to much yesterday bc I didnt feel the need to. I just felt ok most of the day so I didnt see the need. Thank for the input guys keep it coming till I push this crap out my life  lol,suboxone,cwer1ou,2,t5_2t4ye
5501916,0,t3_3qdve0,If your doc appt is in the am lets say am your last opiate dose needs to be taken the night before pm.  You needs to be in withdraws before starting subs.  There is a specific selfadministered test that lets you know if you are ready I cant recall the name of it.Tell doc bout sleeping issues he may prescribe somethings for sleep.  I found that once I was on subs my sleep dramatically improved.  Some will allow you to smoke weed others not. PM me if ya got any more questions. ,suboxone,cwex6ff,2,t5_2t4ye

I feel the same way even on subs I dont have cravings but still wanna use anyway if that makes sense.

6992917,0,t1_d11jwob,Hey I havent been on Reddit for a bit but I was glad to see a message and I want to thank you for your well wishes.I really havent focused too much on how long Ive been sober  to each his own... but I know from the past that youre only sober until youre not.  But I just did a little math and looked an my calendar and today is my  day clean.  When you first responded  months ago I never thought Id be at this point.  This opportunity my chance to do this is unbelievable.  Before I started this process I had never lost anyone to drugs.  I had cut people out of my of course but I hadnt really seen the consequences.  The first week of my group sessions a girl overdosed  bad batch full of fentanyl.  She was there one day and just gone the next... Since then when kid got kicked out of the program but we grew to be a pretty tight group.  There is a girl Danielle we had some kind of chemistry or spark... something.  She had done jail time prison time overdosed more times than she could remember  but she was special her spirit was special.  She iswas on Vivitrol on the program for her kids.  She missed  group because she called in sick... She hasnt come back shes been gone for  weeks.  Patient confidentiality wont let the docs or pyschs tell me anything not even her status in the program and I get it.  We only heard about the first girls death because the obituary becomes public information.  I miss her and I think about her every night not romantically or anything like that but just wishing I could have grabbed her arm the last time I saw her and held her in place.  I feel like she just slipped away.  And whats ironic is that as much as I want to know shes okay my biggest fear is a counselor mentioning her name  that means shes become public information.  Im sorry to vent Ive written about it my sobriety journal but I needed to put it out to someone real... And just put it out in the universe.  My sober friends got left behind and Im working to earn them back.  I kicked my using friends out of my life I wish them the best but theyre not making an effort.  She was the first connection I made with someone on this path.  And I feel like she slipped away.....Thank you so much.  I dont want to drop anything heavy on you like that I just needed to type it.  I hope all is well with you... Im watching this coverage of the bombings in Brussels and it makes you realize how precious life is.  Im really glad to be taking mine back and you had a huge influence on me as I was taking that first step.  I cannot thank you enough.  Be well.,suboxone,d18zmzf,2,t5_2t4ye
7612611,0,t3_4jh2z7,I went to NA the first year of my recovery and just didnt tell anyone I was taking suboxone. Nobody can force you to talk or divulge anything about yourself or any medications you are taking. So that would be my suggestion.,suboxone,d37iimr,2,t5_2t4ye
7716158,0,t1_d3j9kmr,Honestly? Because theyre sketchy as fuck in the eyes of the insurance company. Im not sure what your particular doctor doesdoesnt do during office visits but the one my husband goes to is basically a pill mill. You come in might take a drug test see a doctor for about  seconds and leave with a prescription for  suboxone. If youre insurance is willing to pay thats awesome but most suboxone doctors dont even have billing codes because they dont actually do anything worth billing if that makes sense.,suboxone,d3j9vyz,1,t5_2t4ye
7784472,0,t1_d3lhl77,Hey thanks!!! I ended up not calling  the nurse at my doctors office calmed me down.

7875131,0,t1_d3wvvyw,Thanks for everyones replies here but especially yours Im now taking it in split doses and its waaay better.   I didnt tell my whole story here but I was on methadone for  months before Subs. While it did get me sober it was hell to get off. I tapered for  months from  mgs. I agree with everything you said about methadone. Sub is so much better! I was a zombie on methadone amp still felt my dose wasnt high enough. I dont feel a thing on subs but Im alert aware my reaction time is normal...amp Ive been  off H amp sober since December ! Yay!,suboxone,d418jx1,1,t5_2t4ye

7890219,0,t1_d42vrzy,Thanks for responding! I think tomorrow Ill try to skip. I have my grandmothers funeral saturday which will  days since last dose of h and Im doing tiny tiny bits of sub. I do not even want to be on it for  weeks. I doubt Ive even taken mg with these strips. Theyre dissolved within a minute if that. So thats how tiny they are. Tomorrow should be the day h withdrawals start to peak according to my research so Im hoping to be okay enough to skip. I have absolutely no pains or anything. Im just anxious I guess because Im counting these days just trying to get past  days. And I feel exhausted but last night I could not get comfortable and kept waking up restless. I do have some melatonin and hylands restless legs. Any other suggestions? Do you think with how small my dosing is I should be able to get off pretty easily? I mean Ive got these strips cut so small I need tweezers to pick it up and put it under my tongue. Just hearing input really helps my anxiety and stuff.

9470027,0,t3_510o2m,Man I have had absolutely no luck with therapy. Maybe I should try it for a longer amount of time but it never seemed to help with the PTSDdepression shit. I am a pretty smooth selftalker though so im able to get myself up out of it  of the time. Part is just accepting that everything doesnt have to be perfect all the time.AA though never worked for me. Props for those who it does work for it just straight didnt make me feel good in any kind of way. Honestly the whole fourth step thing ruined it instantly for me. We didnt all have a part in bad shit that happened in our life. There are legitimate victims out there you dont have to live like one but you dont have to accept culpability for something you didnt do or would wish on your worst enemy. I am somehow OK after ive been through. Its a miracle really. I mean the cravings come and go and I have some really shitty days but im doing better than a lot of my peers who never went through the heroincokesuboxone merrygoround. We really need more studies done on how to help people cope with pain. I see so many people hurting it kills me ,suboxone,d9gdx26,1,t5_2t4ye
9554143,0,t1_d9qorei,Thanks for the post it certainly gives me some food for thought.  Im on mg twice a day so my dose is up there which concerns me but Im definitely noticing benefits from the increase.  Its one of those things where Im worried about being over prescribed but noticing the difference.  I agree that sometimes it feels like the doctor doesnt understand.  The whole time he sold this as a miracle solution with no side effects but its clear there are many to consider.  And he said the withdrawals werent too bad and considering all the heroin addicts saying its worse makes me a little dubious about that statement.  At the same time its working so its leaving me uncertain.If you dont mind me asking was there a reason you decided to quit after  years?  Was it still helping up until that point?  Was it becoming problematic side effect wise? Or was it unrelated to its efficacy or side effects?,suboxone,d9qqu8e,2,t5_2t4ye

Im glad this info is there for anyone who reads through old threads which I did so...anyways its over ten days now right? Howre you doing? I kind of had my first real conflict yesterday and had a little break downpanic attack. I was pretty uncomfortable and didnt have a lot of control of my emotions so it looks like I need to work on some coping skills for sure. I didnt do anything stupid I just felt really really bad and I kept thinking I must be over reacting but oh well. Today was even a rough start because of it but Im starting to feel better. I did have reasons to be upset for sure I just want to be in more control of how I feel. I know everyone struggles with this regardless of their circumstances. I have very much appreciated the prayers and think of you often. I am not religious Im not atheist either but wasnt raised in church.

10988672,0,t3_5wwvaf,My doctor only checked to see if norbupe was present in my system and if it wasnt he would then do a more indepth test. For me it was just a matter of taking my dose a day before my appointment. If your doctor is testing specific levels you may need more accuracy as to the peak time of norbupe after taking buprenorphine. It is a morally questionable thing to lie to your doctor like this but its something I understand based on what I went through. As long as it helps you get better in the long run instead of relapsing after your insurance runs out.,suboxone,dedj4rq,1,t5_2t4ye
11211571,0,t1_df2ln22,Right why though? Im unaware of any significant interactions with taking Adderall or similar while on subs. Did your Dr explain why she doesnt want to treat you for both? If it was benzos you thought you needed I would understand them denying that.I have been on Adderall and subs awhile back and my Dr was very confident that it was perfectly safe. My next  Drs all had the same opinion. If I were you Id really discuss the reasoning behind denying you this med you seem to actually need while on subs with your Dr. Youve gone how long with treating your ADD? And how confident are you in not relapsing or buying methodone off the street once your off subs? Id definitely think about the risks and benefits for yourself remember you can always find another Dr. Is your Dr even properly weening you off subs? Coming off subs can be a seriously painfully time consuming ordeal Id be cautious of just doing the cold turkey bit just so this one dr will prescribe you some meds.,suboxone,df2thie,1,t5_2t4ye

11578057,0,t1_dftblz5,I know Im a little late to the party here but this sounds exactly like me and my SO. Were in our early s and hes been on subs since Ive known him. Hes on a smaller dose breaking each strip down to about mgday and is starting to wean off completely. At best we have sex once a week but more often once a month sometimes longer. He agrees that his sex drive improves when the subs have worn off and hes due for a dose. Its always been pretty consistent even in the beginning. Hes not affectionate at all either.Ive begged and offered to try anything new to encourage more frequent sex because my sex drive is pretty high but I also know he masturbates fairly regularly even with me in the next room. I think it partially stems from general lazinessselfishness because he doesnt really enjoy doing anything for me. He just likes to get it done as quickly as possible. I take it very personally though and am pretty depressed after a couple years of this. I dont think its me but its hard to accept that.Hes also terrible at communicating. If he told me how he thinks we could  fix the problems we have I would be willing to try but he tends to get angry with me rather than listen to my feelings and wont make any suggestions. He had a bad childhood and doesnt really know how to take care of anyone but himself. I know this is shitty and not an excuse and that I shouldnt put up with it but thats another story. Ive found that emailing him is the only way to get through to him because hell read it instead of yelling over me because he feels like hes being attacked and then make changes over the next few days.The similarities in your story blew me away. Im sorry youre dealing with this I know how awful it can be. Unfortunately I think they both probably need therapy but Im sure I couldnt convince my SO it was worthwhile. I think the subs could definitely be a factor in the sex drive but since hes always been on them since I met him its hard to be sure. Going from being high to taking subs just to avoid withdrawal it would make sense that his mood might change. I know as mine weans off its going to be a rough road and even after he quits the subs it can take a while for his brain chemistry to return to normal. I really hope you find a solution.,suboxone,dg8dnkq,1,t5_2t4ye
