11367597,0,t1_dfjve2k,Moving out at  is really just an American thing it isnt practiced anywhere else in the world.  So I do think it will become completely normal in the next  years for children to be living with their parents well into their s and even s.  It wont be seen as a social stigma it will just be viewed as everyday life. Moving out at  and single occupancy apartments really are a very wasteful concept.  Its incredibly wasteful for a single person to have his own refrigerator stove heating and bathroom.  if building codes get relaxed then the young may want to move into smaller apartments with shared kitchens living rooms and bathrooms. ,economicCollapse,dfkhu4m,5,t5_2qn15
