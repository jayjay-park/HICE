Pull it close enough to slip stitch into the start and then pull it to the final tightness closing the circle completely after youve finished the second round.

831515,0,t1_cgyqfab,That actually sounds like what I would advice you to do only make the round up to  rows into where it starts going up so you can have a nice even bottom and it doesnt rock or bowl up.                    A tip use quilters batting and make sure to run a neddle through the peice a few times going threw both the top and bottom layer and batting so when the new pup fluffs the bed all the insides dont get smooshed to one side which can happen when washing it as well.  Could be as simple as running a needle threw the dead center a few times.           I have not made a crochet dog bed but I have sewn my share of doggie beds for my two monsters they ATE the first  sets.

931716,0,t1_cha4yyy,I find its typical that people change the yarnhook size to suit what they have one hand.  I do it all the time.            Have you been using stitch markers?  They may help with your count issue till you get the rhythm of the flower down.                  Also Heidis Pentagons that long stitch is your increase on that row and some times it can hide the next stitch so double check that it is not where you may be loosing a st.                     If all else fails and yours are just small but you want that big Happy add an other boarder row to your finished penhexs                    Wish I could help more or be more specific hopefully someone who has the pattern and worked it can jump in and offer advice. ,crochet,cha6vm8,1,t5_2qm6c

1009717,0,t3_25nlet,It all depends on what you are making.                   uSunnyInDenmark gives a good example of a evenly spaced increase in the round.  Which can work for a lot of things that have the perfectly round shape.  You just keep fallowing the repeating pattern of increases till it is as big as you feel is life size.                        If what you are trying to make isnt round its a whole new bucket of incdec for shaping affects.  What character are you aiming to make and I can try to point you in the right direction?              Keep in mind some items like Totoro where made holding a double strand to give more structure so the finished item wouldnt loose its shape.,crochet,chj299u,1,t5_2qm6c

You can work the legs as part of the body semi easily.  When you get to the row you want to add them on work till the star of where the first leg would be IE say there is  st in the round and your starting point for the round is mid back you would work  st chain  sk  work  chain  sk  work the last  stitches then start your decrease rounds around those  stitches.  After that is worked closed you would go back and pick up working in the round on the st  sk chain to work the legs.                          Does that make sense?,crochet,chjqdal,1,t5_2qm6c

1208100,0,t3_27y240,Unfortunately youre missing one page of the pattern.  The second picture with the shells is for a different top.  To make this you begin with Diagrama  the prong looking diagram.  The circles represent chains the Ts with a slash represent dc.  Start with the black arrow pointing to the circle.      ch  sl st     ch   dc in the ring.Now on to the leftmost prong.    ch  counts as first dc and ch  dc ch  dc         gt look at the diagram for placement of the dc    ch  dc     ch  counts as first dc and ch  dc ch  x    ch  dc     ch  counts as first dc and ch  dc ch  x    ch  dc         repeat the last two rows  times.    ch  counts as first dc and ch dc ch  x ch dc    ch  dc  cluster  dc together    ch  counts as first dc and ch dc ch x    ch  dc         repeat the last two rows  more times    ch  cluster  dc together        tie off.Repeat this pattern for the other two prongs casting on at the other two black arrows.Then you need the missing Diagrama  which looks like it should be a netting like    sl st into the side of a dc at end of the first row of a prong    ch  sl st like above in the st row of the next prong    ch  sl st in the side at top of the dc in the next row ch  sc in the chspace ch  sl st in the next dc from the first prong.    repeat this last row down the prongs repeating the pattern in  an additional time per row.The same type of netting is likely needed for the back and to fill in between the prongs and the bust.     cast on to the starting ring of the prongs    ch the circumference of your chest under boobs not too tight theres no stretch! sl st in the ring    repeat the netting pattern above but for the first row sc in every rd chThe two triangles for the bust are made last.  Start at the black arrow on the right.  Follow the pattern very similar to the prongs back and forth sl st at the end of each row into the body of the top into every rd st of the top until you reach the white arrow. Tie off.  Cast on at the second black arrow and follow the pattern as before.Good luck.,crochet,ci5j2n8,4,t5_2qm6c
1209379,0,t3_27yldr,It looks like you did not pick up enough stitches in the side of your brim start.  Which is making your brim flare out.  For working into the sides of HDC I normally do a   combo work  st into the side of one HDC then  into the next and repeat.  Some times if my guage is loose I have to work a    repeat and if its tight    repeat you just have to test it out and find out what works for you.                                           Am I right in saying you made a long strip of short rows of HDC ie chain  hdc  back  and forth then stitched it into the round to pick up stitches along the edge?  If so the Foundation start will have no effect on this hat as the start is just a vertical part of the brim its handy if your working a long chain start brim where you dont work into the sides but the FHDC for the whole brim and just switch stitchs for the body.,crochet,ci5o92m,1,t5_2qm6c

Every time I go in the shop girl acts like crocheters are a rare endangered and possibly potentially poisonous species. She asked me once if crocheters use stitch markers too and I was tempted as I said yes to tell her that we have electricity and plumbing also.This past week she decided to start lecturing me on the subject of superwash merino. Id sort of mused that I wasnt sure why so many commercial handspinners spun their superwash in a very tight compact ply rendering superwash less soft than it could be. She knows that I handspin but she certainly doesnt. I dont know how it goes in crocheting? but with knitting when youre finishing it you know it spreads out. Yes thank you. I am familiar with the concept of blocking.Another time she asked me if I could use the same yarn as knitters. I.... didnt know how to respond to that in a noninsulting way so I just nodded.,crochet,cidlswa,14,t5_2qm6c

Stitch to inside of garter behind ribbon band so its hidden leaving ends of tube open.  Feed elastic through tube secure elastic ends in manner of your choice stitch tube shut.  If you really wanted you could secure the elastic to the tube in places after stretching the garter by tacking it in place with a few stitches to prevent the bulk of the lace from bunching in a single area.,crochet,ck73k6o,2,t5_2qm6c

2096597,0,t3_2ix5wk,It is using a slip stitch in the first chain from your hook. You arent joining the chain into a circle although I can see how you could get that idea from the use of slip stitch instead of the more common sc in the second chain.It looks like you will be making a triangle rather than a rectangle. One side is sc and the other is hdc.  This will allow the shaping at the crown. The slip stitch at the very end if the row will make the point come together more so you dont have a gap.,crochet,cl6bo7w,4,t5_2qm6c

The two Ive made have been for men and both seem to fit nice and snug... but theyre actually too small for me because I have a lot of hair . I think I may try your suggestion you mentioned in the comments below or Im going to go up a hook size for each step and see if that helps with the overall slouchinesssnugness.EDIT along a similar note one of the guys that has one actually pulled it all the way down onto his head and folded the brim over itself kind of like a skullcap. I just thought that was an interesting alternative to someone who doesnt want the slouchy look.

2688345,0,t3_2qrsw9,Hello everyone! Im a   in a couple of days y.o. notsolady. I live just outside of Chicago and attend university there after much screwing up in my s. I have  dogs and a green cheek conure who tend to take up the majority of my free time so yarn work has taken a back seat for now. I first learned to crochet when I was about  years old from my mom but neither of us had the patience to get me past chaining and sc. When I was in my early s I dated a friend whose mom taught me the basics how to read a pattern and got me through my first blanket by helping me with attaching and edging only now do I realize that woman should be nominated for sainthood. I also have a Readers Digest book about needlework that I used to learn some of the more basic stitches. Im not entirely sure how I would categorize my skill level. Im incredibly good at reading patterns and following instructions although my tension is still variable so I have problems with consistency. I also prefer my projects to keep my hands busy but not my mind so I tend to gravitate toward simple things that dont take a lot of time. ,crochet,cn9hinu,3,t5_2qm6c

3003229,0,t3_2ugmqt,When I move north I found a LYS and decided to pop in to look around. The closest big box craft store is  minutes away. The owner was really nice and asked what my craft was. I told her crochet but Ive always wanted to learn how to knit. She invited me to the knitting circle held at her shop on Fridays and told me crocheters are welcome too but if I wanted to learn how to knit any of the girls would be happy to show me. So I went. I sat down next to a older woman and pulled out my project. It was a  yarn single crochet beast. Meant for a queen bed. It is thick and unruly and I was making it for a  yo who loves it. I loved it too. Anyway so this older woman looks at me and asks what Im doing so give her the back story and i pull out my hook. She grabs onto the blanket and says this is cheap yarn. Its red heart I can tell my the feel. I told her yes that it is red heart and since its for a young child I didnt want to buy an expensive yarn that hed destroy. She drops it and says that is a labor of love. How..nice. I could see the other older women of the group nod their heads in agreement.Seriously I would never touch anyone elses project without their permission. My project is my baby. Dont touch my baby.She has been the only rude knitter Ive met. The younger girls were much nicer so in my experience the younger generation has been more open to both crafts. Its a bummer though I could have learned so much from that old bat but she just had to be a bitch lol,crochet,co9a6qn,3,t5_2qm6c

Which is why there will be buttons so that its versatile. For the Border I did a series of SC ch DC ch TC  CH Picot TC ch DC ch SC Repeat  times on each scallop. At the end of each scallop I found that adding an extra SC makes the repeats start on the same stitch. If theres any interest I could draw up a diagram of where the stitches were placed. I found the tip needed a few extra SC in the middle to get the  repeats to land where it was easiest so needless to say it took a little fudging around.Heres a link to my project page for giggles That borderThe close upLaying out some buttonsMore buttonsAll the buttons,crochet,cpd7qid,3,t5_2qm6c

The booklet was from  and it included all sorts of baby clothes blankets and accessories.  She had been using the same steel hook for  years to make things for friends and family.  The hook was curved from the number of years and projects that she had created.  She wanted to get the book and the hook framed as a way to retiring her craft since her hands were not able to hold the hook anymore.  We talked for an hour about all of the amazing things that she created and how much she loved crochet.  I was so happy to be able to preserve something that would last just as long if not longer than the projects that she made.  This post reminded me of her   Thank you!,crochet,cppd7z2,14,t5_2qm6c

Once you get the gauge see if you can work it out on graph paper.The aspect ratio of your image isnt the same as the throw you want to make.  When you make it wider you would end up with a fleur de lis just over  wide.Even if the popcorns were only  wide trying to make an image with complex curves over only  pixels wont give you much detail.  A Saints fan might recognize it but it may look a bit like a cartoon airplane.If you made it with DK or finer yarn youd get more pixels but it wouldnt be very thickwarm and would take longer.,crochet,cqm7cmz,1,t5_2qm6c

I left thinking she was just an idiot not mean. The next store I checked out actually had a sign on the door that said Crocheters Welcome.

The number of rows will really depend on how big your sphere is going to be.  For a small sphere  sts circumference use  rows.  For a medium sphere  sts use  rows.  Etc.,crochet,cvuuyhq,9,t5_2qm6c

The hideous blankets Ive done and didnt want to finish for whatever reason Im glad theyre done now and Im proud of myself for doing it.As for the scratchy thing to quote someone who I made a scratchy acrylic blanket for  usually with afghans you put the blanket over another one. I put mine on top of my quilt so I get the warmth from it but I dont get to feel the scratchiness. So scratchy things arent all that bad if you use them like that. And it should get softer after a wash and all you have to do is wash it again when it gets scratchy. Make sure to wash and dry it properly because it can get worse if you dont. ,crochet,cw7zylu,2,t5_2qm6c

5737642,0,t3_3tq57w,okay Ill try to see if I can help.If it says chain ....first does the pattern tell the total stitch count at the end of the rows?  If it does that will help...Because here is what I would do looking at the pic and your notes not the patternChain .  So it is  stitches plus the  for the first dc.  some patterns will note this as  fyi and dc into the th chain then dc the next  creating your  dcs the chain  first dc will be a little loop at the endThen the ch  after the  dc is the start of the little loops so after the  dc chain  then continue the dc into the very next chain creating the loopsgapslacey look.Anyways....I personally change how I do these projects.  I use a Foundation Single Crochet instead of making a chain     This was its stretchy instead of being tight which works really well for items that your wear.  Also you would make exactly  FSC and not have to stress if it means  ch or .Then for the dc at the end of the rows I use a Standing Double Crochet instead of the ch  to lift to the next row    I find it is easier to find the dc loops at the end to stitch into instead of trying to stitch in the chain. this part might be confusing...but the website pictures may explain better than I canThese are a little more advanced but like learning a Magic Circle....they can really help tidy up the project and once you have them down can be easier than stitching exactly as the pattern says.So what I would do looks like this Row   FSC join with sl st to first FSC to start working in the round.  Row  SDC as first dc dc next  ch  dc next  ch  dc next  join with sl st.  Row  SDC instead of ch  follow pattern as written...just skip the ch  after the sl st because the SDC takes care of it.If you need more help...feel free to PM me and Ill try my best to help.  Good luck that pattern looks fun!,crochet,cx8b70k,2,t5_2qm6c

So after making a bunch I remembered pinning this puff star stitch on pinterest. I thought they would look good together so I used trial and error to figure out how to best combine them. When the fringe wasnt full enough I braided it between the flowers to give it a more even volume. Im so happy you like it!Edit I highly recommend that stitch for winter! It works up fairly quickly and it is very thick! I used a worsted yarn and it is  of an inch thick! ,crochet,cyihs6o,15,t5_2qm6c

Of course as I said in another post I think she originally DID intend to pay for them it just hit her that if she claimed poverty I would hopefully say take them anyway and shed have her  PLUS the blankets.

During the first pass youre probably pulling the yarn through the stitch too much and over compensating. This is just a guess from my experience in Tunisian maybe experiment with a few rows to see if you catch yourself doing anything differently than with the rest of the row.,crochet,czwjjqs,2,t5_2qm6c

9918450,0,t1_db0duwu,Thanks! I thought it was super easy and it worked up relatively quickly. I watched a video on how to do tunisian knit stitch and didnt have any trouble with it. Once you get the hang of it you can really cruise through it. The only thing I would have done differently was use a larger diameter hook. The edges curl quite a bit if you work it too tightly. I had to make the border wide enough to compensate and flatten it out.,crochet,db0edr8,1,t5_2qm6c

9945661,0,t3_5hye18,So yeah that pattern at the bottom image is pretty complex and lovely and non English.If you look at that part that looks like HG with an arrow on the left that is where the chain symbols start.And then the little arc is to slip stitch back and then the little pluses are single crochet the T with one line in the middle is a double and so on.Edit T is a half double and the V with a line in each part of it is two doubles in one stitch.So yeah middle part then you go back and do the leave ridges and then end up back at the middle where your main chain ended and there you chain a stem and then do the lower or backbone of the leaf.Great pattern I might make a couple. ,crochet,db3y0ii,3,t5_2qm6c

I was so stunned in the moment that I just kind of stared at her and then went to talk to someone else. Actually one other time I had a similar experience but it wasnt because the items were crocheted but because they were handmade at all. It was another baby shower and Id made a blanket and a hat with matching baby booties for a pretty good friend of mine. She loved everything and was so kind about it but her mom was very blatant in her distaste and she goes Why... Why wouldnt you just buy something of quality? Why on earth would you make something out of yarn for Petes sake for a baby nonetheless! Why wouldnt you buy something we needed from the baby registry? We registered for blankets and hats buy one off of there! Buy something of quality at least!

10959451,0,t1_deacwtx,I basically followed the square pattern but shortened the length of the sides and then engineered the heck out of it. Several times I thought I had it but then got several rows in and found that it was a bit wonky so I would frog back and try again. I ended up having to add another round of blue just to make everything line up and connect correctly.The original pattern isnt  symmetric but I figured out that its that way on purpose.  When you crochet in the round your start of round migrates to the right slightly.  So a stitch that should be directly above another stitch  rows down is actually off to the right by about one stitch width.  The square pattern from the original designer fights this by slowly moving the most important elements of the snowflake to the left.I ended up doing the same thing.  So there are a few places where my pattern seems a bit odd but its just to fight the slight wander that naturally happens.  As you can see from my photo everything lies flat and the lines are naturally straight even without blocking I havent blocked the hexagon in the photo.  My poor wife had to put up with me pausing Netflix constantly so that I could concentrate.  The funny thing is that she didnt know that I was trying to modify a pattern.  After I finished it I showed her the result and explained the whole thing and then she said something to the effect of Oh thats why you kept frogging so much.  I thought you had just messed up badly!I put my altered version of the pattern in my project page ,crochet,deae1gj,13,t5_2qm6c

11031928,0,t3_5xdxd3,. YouTube is the best place for tutorials.. Ravelry is a great place to find both knitting and crochet patterns . Always always always count your stitches. If youre using a pattern make sure you use the same hook and yarn size that the pattern recommends or your project wont be the right size.. Youre gonna undo so many stitches but thats okay. It happens to everyone. . Some patterns count the starting chain as a stitch some dont. I found this particularly confusing when I started crocheting but the pattern should tell you. . Always check whether your pattern is in US or UK terminology. This usually isnt a big deal Ive found most I use are in US. But on websites like Ravelry many patterns are in UK ,crochet,deifzns,1,t5_2qm6c

11212591,0,t3_60213h,Bptc is the same as fpdc in the sense that you go around the post its just that youre looking at it from the back so the yarn goes in front of the post based on how youre looking at it. The hook goes behind the post from right to left pull up a loop from left to right then YO as the stitch calls. Its hard to explain. Once you work through a couple pattern repeats it gets easier. Bp stitches still give me trouble in terms of not losing the first loop you pull up. ,crochet,df2xn9i,1,t5_2qm6c

11317219,0,t3_61ijtv,Disclaimer havent done this afghan but I think your problem is that youre mistaking the ch for the last dc in the row. The way Im looking at it you will actually be putting your next dc into the last stitch of the row. So from where you currently are youll skip one dc dc into the next dc ch and turn. Remember that ch is only for height you shouldnt be crocheting into it. I think youre hitting this problem in the third row because its the first time youre encountering that ch in the at the end of the previous row. My advice would be to go three more rows and see how the edges look doing it this way. If it doesnt look right well crochet unravels easily and its a better use of your time than staring at that end. Good luck!PS if this is a popular pattern see if you can find one of the new symbol patterns for it. I find those so much easier to understand. ,crochet,dfesdyc,2,t5_2qm6c
