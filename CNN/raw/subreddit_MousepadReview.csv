4566661,0,t3_3djq1g,So you mentioned that your past experiences with cheap mouse pads is that your bad mouse would drag and feel slow. So with your new mouse pad to go with your Naga do you want a mouse pad that gives your mouse a fast or slow glide when using it? All of todays mouse pads from big companies like Steelseries Corsair Razer etc. dont really have drastic quality differences. The differences mainly reside within the textures of the different mouse pads.,MousepadReview,ct68pc7,1,t5_360i9
5112460,0,t3_3jz9e6,I exactly know your problem with the qck collecting dead skin and sweat.. just wash it. Use water and a handbrush rub everything out. Itll get dry pretty quick. You can use a hairdryer to accelerate the process but dont put it too hot.Itll feel and look like new afterwards and the mouse will glide more again.I used to wash mine around once a month intil I switched to a different one.,MousepadReview,cv28qsj,2,t5_360i9
7846912,0,t3_4mge6q,Have not had the benefit of trying an Artisan pad but would really love to. As far as what you are describing the QCK Puretrak Talent and the Glorious line of pads all have that control and stopping power. They are nothing like hard pads or slippery mouse pads. ,MousepadReview,d3y28j6,1,t5_360i9
9748306,0,t3_5eqc1w,what did you do to your qck? ive been using the same one now for  years and no problems at all.besides that the zowie gsr is the best option imo out of what you have listed there.,MousepadReview,daeovxs,1,t5_360i9

10671576,0,t3_5soqlj,The Glorious pad surface is pretty similar IMO. The shape is more rectangular than square like the QCK though.,MousepadReview,ddgoxh4,1,t5_360i9
