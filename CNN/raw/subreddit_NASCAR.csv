Among the various action figures was a rolled up NASCAR poster showing all of the Winston Cup Pontiacs behind a Grand Prix pace car on some high banked turn. All other things being equal wider is better. I cant find a picture of it online but heres a video from that advertising campaign for a regular Grand Prix. Anyway I loved it because I remembered that ad campaign and kept the poster. To hear that Brian France mandated a template car width is like being slapped in the face. That really sucks.

417778,0,t1_cfo0b7e,I agree to an extent. Im trying really hard to believe that I would feel the same way I do now if it were Jr. instead of Busch. I like when Jr. runs the  Nationwide races a year. Im cool with that. I think if he were spending as much time racing in the lower series as Kyle does that Id be annoyed that hes not focusing more on the Cup series. Honestly do you ever see Jimmie racing elsewhere? What I do like are drivers like Jr. and others sponsoringowning teams in the lower series. Im likely to watch just to see how Jr.s guys do. But running and winning nearly every week? I think they need to forfeit the purse as well as the points. ,NASCAR,cfo2h8l,2,t5_2qs08

419385,0,t3_1yusei,I think it was and I think the main reason it was is because the drivers didnt know when the race would actually end. No one was in the typical follow the leader mode they normally are in at Daytona instead it was fight hard to be in the position to win if the rain comes.I enjoyed every minute of it this if funny of course since after the unveiling of the retarded new points system I was ready to quit watching the sport all together.

459206,0,t3_1zbmgv,It really helps when you find a driver to root for. Whether its because they win a lot driving style or personality  whatever. Finding a driver or a few drivers that you really like for one reason or another will get you into it.Might take a few races for drivers personalities to come through but itll happen.For me  I grew up in a racing family. My dad used to race street stocks and limited late models when I was growing up in the early s and once he hung it up he moved into a crew position for a buddy who had a pro stock. Wed be at the local short tracks every weekend and then Sundays were always Cup races on the couch. At about  or  years old  ish I could probably identify every Cup driver just by their paint scheme.When youre  years old and watching your dads car roll  or  times down the back stretch the reality of racing hits you hard and will never ever leave you.

459217,0,t1_cfsgbs3,Depends on if you choose to buy em beforehand and tune in using one of the frequency guide or do some sort of rental deal. Id call the track to price rentals and look around on the Internet for buying em if I were you then make a call. While buying is probably the better deal in the long run if this is a rare occurence for you renting might be cheaper for now and will probably come with a preprogrammed set of frequencies. Either way its been a few years for me but Id set aside up to a hundred bucks for it especially if youre looking at renting two headphones.

Shortening the race length to  miles also really helped.Things I think its got going for it Only turn course with an awesome history Independently owned Decision on whether or not to shift I think this is the case again? Nearly impossible to setup a perfect car given that each corner is so different. Its a balancing act. Depending on track position you can pit without losing a lap. This changes strategy quite a bit. Really reasonable ticket prices. Heck with that Walmart promo last year you could get grandstand tickets for . Tickets arent usually the most expensive part of attending a race but thats a nice bonus.Things against Two race dates way to close together in the middle of the summer.  weeks apart. Prone to long green flag runs on a huge track which spreads the field out. If youre watching for ontrack beating and banging and sidebyside  of the time its probably boring. Theres so much strategy here.

Each week Goodyear provides data on the tires to the teams  along with parameters for setting their car up limits on camber angles tire pressures etc.  When the teams deviate outside of these limits to try and gain a competitive advantage you have BIG problems.This generally happens once or twice a year as the teams ratchet things back and then gradually go off the reservation again.

654808,0,t1_cgeg2vk,Seems to have been the biggest source of them on rNASCAR gt Well the one drug that Denny is allegedly hooked on is also the drug that happens to be very easy to get out of your system. Cocaine does not really have any biological molecules to latch onto to stay in your system. it is said that it can leave your body in as little as  hours. So it would be easy to get rid of it early in the week before you head to the track. gt Well its not really a story the biggest rumor around the pits as to how he gets away with it is that he only does it the night after a race or the day after that way a few days later if he does get randomed even on tech day he will show up clean.gt Im not saying what is right or wrong im just giving some insight on what is talked about around the garage could just be rumors or there could be some truth to what is being said.gt Coming from someone in the racing business it is actually widely speculated that he has had a cocaine problem for quite some time now.gt     They wouldnt post a random fun fact like this for no reason unless they are making a point or alluding to something about to come out. . For awhile now people have known about Dennys potential drug habits inside of the racing community so it is actually quite easy to speculate that they are talking about him.gtSource Racecar driver crew member son of team owner,NASCAR,cgep9lo,4,t5_2qs08

It could be for a bit of fun but if you look at it from an economical standpoint then you will probably end up losing more money on electricity costs than you will make in dogecoin. Not to mention that laptops generally arent that good at cooling themselves so you run the risk of overheating the computer. That being said when I was starting out with dogecoin I did it for a bit of fun to learn about how everything works and if you can keep track of your computer heat and not go overboard with it then Id strongly recommend giving it a go!

842009,0,t1_cgzz8li,Because this is a car business. Chevy will pay good money to have Jimmie Johnson or Dale Earnhardt to run in a Chevy SS. That is another reason why they made the cars look like the cars you can buy on the road except the Ford Fusion looks more like an Aston Martin. Also the manufacturers can also be there for support to the teams. Kind of like Ill scratch your back if you scratch mine. But in reality it is pretty much a strategic alliance. Which is a pretty much saying that a team falls under a big umbrella. For example if you look at the airline industry you have many airlines who are under one umbrella because it helps reduce cost and you can also share things such as intellectual information or hell you can even shareleasebuy cars if the price is right and a team wishes to do so. But with the airline metaphor if youl look at Star Alliance under their umbrella are airlines such as United Airlines Air China Air Candada Luftstansa and a lot of other airlines. While these are different companies it is easier to have an alliance because it would be cheaper to buy jets share hangers and any mechanical information that is shared from Boeing or Airbus. ,NASCAR,cgzzmb2,3,t5_2qs08

If thats the case and the officials feel like there isnt an inherent danger in having the drivers race to the checkered then they wouldnt throw the yellow at all. So accidentally crashing to bring the yellow is moot because it wouldnt do anything except leave you with a very expensive heap of scrap metal. Basically they just wrecked at the right moment for the ending to pan out like it did.,NASCAR,ch9iktc,2,t5_2qs08

Kenseth left and then dominated with JGR last year Edwards is rumored to be leaving after this season Biffle is past his prime Stenhouse hasnt really panned out in Cup and Bayne has had numerous issues since his Daytona  win in . Not to mention that Roush hasnt traditionally done the best job with attracting new sponsors. Penske has already eclipsed them as the top Ford team. Sometimes I wonder if John Henrys group will eventually leave Roush because of the lack of any real success.

Money. The biggest issue with online companies is making them realize that there is a target audience out there. Many tech and online based companies arent familiar enough with NASCAR to know that there is room to make money here.

1038814,0,t3_25xukf,I dont think it would go over well and heres whyAny sponsor worth their salt is going to do their research. Yes theyll see who got elected MPD but at the same time theyre going to ask how many  per vote does that translate to. I think Dale Jr. fans probably dont stuff the ballot box as much as one might think and so the marketing reach to vote ratio would be much better.Think of it this way votes for Dale Jr probably equals about  potential customers where  votes for Josh probably equals about  potential customers lets be honest not ALL of Reddit is in on this stuff because of the multiple votes wed all be putting in.Dont get me wrong I love the whole Josh Wise thing and think its really great for the sport Dogecoin and PPR but I just dont think it would be beneficial to tick off  of the sports fans for something that mathematically wont actually guarantee sponsorship.

1050287,0,t3_264syh,I think we may be witnessing a bit of struggle in NASCAR fandom and reporting. On the one hand weve seen a few articles and comments from old school NASCAR reporters that have been critical of inclusion of Wise in the field via the Fan Vote. These are the types that believe in the old showmans technique of NASCARs past which I think is where a lot of NASCARs current ideas and gimmicks come from. Example having Danica in the field would draw people because shes Danica no other reason than that. People from Reddit who got involved didnt signal a potential shift in the fanbase toward a younger more internetsavvy audience they just messed up the show. On the other hand there are the people like our new Shibe friends who could become genuine NASCAR fans. One way that theyre getting involved in the sport is by being active and engaged in one of NASCARs voting processes. Despite what some writers think they did not game the system nor did they erode some great bastion of integrity by voting for their new favorite driver. They utilized something that was a known quantity for NASCAR to keep their showmans strategy viable and used it to their advantage. Not to extrapolate or be overly hyperbolic but this could be the runup to a moment where NASCAR really has to address change. The ways of old are quickly running out of time and so the old school fans. NASCAR has already proven theyre inept at bringing in new fans with their current ploys. They now need to decide whether they want to possibly alienate a new potential injection of fans or welcome them with open arms and just realize that the old methods dont work as well anymore.

1131090,0,t3_272erv,I went to Charlotte last week for the History  and the CocaCola  and I rented from Racing Electronics. There were like  booths to choose from and they have plenty of extras. They seemed to only have weekend rentals so I rented on Saturday and dropped off Sunday after the race. I think it was like  for a single scanner and single headset. However the headset has another headset port built into the side and my wife was able to use her headphone when connected to my headphones. R.E. also has a package that uses a different scanner and two headsets with microphone. You can talk to the other person which is a great feature since its so fucking loud. The only way I was able to communicate during green flag racing with my wife was text message. I dont really know if the truck race is considered weekend rental if they race Friday night but it never hurts to ask. The guy I rented from also told me that if I decided to buy the scanner  he would take off the cost of the rental even if I decided to buy after the race on Sunday. I didnt buy Hope that helps!,NASCAR,chwuvg6,1,t5_2qs08

Thats just strange to me.I assume the dissolving of the current Sprint and TMobile names are part of the reported contract. Meaning those names would no longer exist after this merger meaning two things.

NASCAR got too big for its britches ran off their core fans and the newer fans are slowly losing interest.   Kids in their teens and twenties dont care about cars anymore and forget about racing.   Everyone in the sport has gotten used to making stupid money and when that dries up its going to be ugly.  This sport more than any other is driven by eyes on TV sets and butts in the stands. Both have been in decline for years with no end in sight.

1343983,0,t3_29fhh8,The article is shit as has been said many times already in this thread but the author does quote Humpy Wheeler who knows a few things about race promotion.  So lets skip ahead to that Speeds  The lap speeds particularly qualifying speeds have been creeping up of late thanks to changes in aero tires and so on to the point that at least a couple of tracks have seen pole speeds over  MPH.  This makes for huge headlines on Friday but poor racing on Sunday.  Wheeler would like to see the speeds brought down about  MPH per track which would seem to cluster the field somewhat. Aero Push  This has been a problem for more than a decade and theres no realistic way to counter it.  A car at speed pushes a huge wall of air over and around it.  If a second car drafts behind the first one it can ride in the slipstream almost indefinitely.  However if the back car tries to pass the front one it runs into the front cars wall of air and its momentum stalls.  Wheeler argues that fixing the first point will help fix the second one.  If the cars are going slower the wall of air they push in front of them is smaller and aero push is less.  But how do you slow them down?  Smaller injectors?  Reprogram the onboard computers?  Futz with the spoilers?  Restrictor plates?  God not that last one.  Bottom line what has sold NASCAR year after year is the idea that on any given Sunday afternoon or Saturday night in this case any team can beat any other team if the driver and crew are up to the task and the breaks fall their way.  What weve been seeing however especially on the mileandahalf tracks is one guy getting out in the clean air and staying there  with everyone else racing for second.  Thats what NASCAR needs to address.  On this point Humpy Wheeler and I agree.,NASCAR,ciktaw5,4,t5_2qs08

Lets just look at the facts instead of throwing out crazy assumptions based on pipe dreams. In  before Annett and his full time  came TBR wasnt utilizing RCR chassis or ECR motors often.  Post Annett the  uses both almost exclusively and the  at plate tracks. In  Blaney had an average finish of  and Yeley ..  Combined they had  lead lap finishes just shy of  of the time.  So far in  the Annett has an average finish of . and the Sorenson ..  Combined they have just  lead lap finishes or . of the time.  Theyve actually gone backwards even though their budget has gone up and theyre using much better equipment. The numbers dont lie the chances of them being a threattop  team in  are none. Even with much better HP and chassis some of the time theyve made next to no gains. Do you honestly think that in less than  years a team whos currently finishing on the lead lap less than  of the time will suddenly morph into a top  team? Im as big of a fan of underdogsunderfunded teams as anyone but Im a realist as far as theyre concerned in Cup. Even  car teams with twice their budget are rarely top  and I dont see another  million materializing anytime soon for them.

1641786,0,t3_2d4avc,Ive always been terrified that something like this could happen in fact I was just thinking about it yesterday after Yeley crashed and waited for the deemed offender to come around.  While its hard to prevent this from happening on the nations short tracks Ive always been amazed that the Nascar officials allow drivers to do this when they could easily steer them away and into the ambulance.  All it would take is a tire blowing the wrecked driver stumbling or a part on the car breaking to have a horrific result like Montoya a la Jet DryerI truly hope that Nascar immediately changes their unwritten policy of letting drivers wait after a wreck to pointshout at the offender...its just not worth the risk even if the fans enjoy it.  ,NASCAR,cjm4131,8,t5_2qs08

1646224,0,t1_cjmnhnv,I believe so. He came up similar as Gordon through USAC so I dont think hes had that much experience which shows how good of a driver he is.

Also its a hell of an exciting time when Watkins Glen comes around and suddenly Ambrose is in the spotlight. Its exciting to watch him go out on a road course and just beat the snot out of all the cup superstars. That being said this year made me realize something. Ambrose does need to go back to V super car racing. With Allmendinger winning at the Glen this year I think Marcos has worn out his stay in nascar. True he did win the nationwide race. But in cup where it counts it seemed the well had run dry. Right now I have a diecast  Stanley  sitting on my desk. Im glad that when Stanley transfers over to JGR and Ambrose returns to his V roots Ill have a reminder of the rare amazing moments that driver and car had in this sport. ,NASCAR,ckewllp,8,t5_2qs08

1932892,0,t1_ckm0zpc,Right and before anyone says this argument doesnt matter someone always does the real merit of it lies in the fact that those other cars all impact the championship contenders. They represent a global variable that all the championship contenders have to deal with  but in a sample size of just  race they will not affect each championship contender equally. Over a sample size of  races however everyones impact on everyone else in the field is very close to equal. Its pure statistics.The reason NASCAR would do better to have more and more events help determine the champion as opposed to other sports is that there are way way way more global variables in NASCAR than there are in other sports and they affect different teams in vastly different ways each race. There needs to be enough events for these variables to affect everyone as equally as possible.Theoretically the more races we have and the longer they are the more accurately the best team the deserving champion is determined. Going back up to  races a year might be unreasonable of course but here we do have  races we could be using that we arent.,NASCAR,ckm3lob,3,t5_2qs08

But the truth is hes visibly shaken up by the whole thing and his life will never be the same either. Thats not the actionsattitude of someone that meant to do harm.

Hes  or  now which is twilight years in F terms.  Vettel at  has time to help rebuild which may take a few years that Alonso simply doesnt have.Button isnt going to be kept.  Hes expensive and .  You dont have two drivers well in to their later years at the same team if you can help it and after all their troubles getting Magnussen in the team for this year.Im not sure in any of this there is a lesser team  Ferrari can beat Red Bull on their day and Red Bull can beat Ferrari on their day.

2279294,0,t1_clt50r3,I dont think he was trying to start the whole brawl that happened but he was trying to make Keselowski accountable. Ive said it a few times already I have no problem with him Kez doing everything he can to win but he should not be hiding behind his crew after the race. He specifically told his crew two weeks ago to be ready because he was going after Kenseth after the race. He needs to be accountable for his actions act like a grown man and stand face to face with his peers instead of hiding behind his crew like a coward. Thats why Harvick gave him a little push. His peers realize hes not being accountable and hiding behind his crew. Denny Hamlin and his spotter both nailed the entire topic today. Both were unbiased and told it exactly like it is. It wasnt a shove either he barely pushed him. Tldr I dont think Harvick did anything wrong or intended to start a brawl just hold Keselowski accountable for his actions even if his actions arent necessarily wrong. ,NASCAR,cltfthj,1,t5_2qs08

At the same time where a lot of these conspiracy theories and such are coming from is the fact that NASCAR is doing a lot to try and make the sport more entertaining interesting exciting or whatever your favorite ing word it relative to racing.So we get things like mystery cautions where the race has been green for a long time the winner is pretty obvious and people are tuning out.  They say oh shit debris in turn  and never show it.  People assume that because they never showed it it must not really be there.  Whether it is or is not who could really say?  The conspiracy theory exists because its plausible and actually makes some decent sense.Then you have things that have actual legitimate connections.  Jimmie Johnson racked up some pretty serious penalties a few years I think?  Someone feel free to correct my time frame ago and Hendrick appealed them.  Hendrick for all intents and purposes can be considered a Chevy factory team.  The appeals guy at NASCAR is a former GM executive who in all likelihood still has ties to the company.  He would benefit from good things happening to Chevy such as Jimmie Johnson winning  championships.We get these conspiracies because NASCAR has closer ties to huge businesses than any other sport in the country.  If you take football for example...sure there are sponsors all over the arenas the broadcasts etc.  But the Patriots beating the Steelers isnt going to raise profits for pretty much anyone...like Nike is going to make money regardless etc.  But the Pepsi car beating the Coke car for the championship?  That could have some real monetary significance could being an important word there.I guess in a way there are more conspiracies because there is more on the line.Note The conspiracies mentioned in this post are not necessarily believed in by the poster but rather were used as examples to try and make a point.,NASCAR,clvcavr,3,t5_2qs08

His first few years at Hendrick were rough due to his inability to communicate with his crew chief but this pairing with Steve Letarte over the past couple years has shown that hes a capable driver.It took me a long time to come around on my opinion of him as well.  About  years ago I thought just about the same way that he was a notalent hack who gets by because of sponsorship and riding his daddys coattails.

I believe hell split the ride with Chase next season then be out fully in .  I wonder if HMS will retire the  after  and switch to the  for Chase full time in  and Jeff Gordon will start his own team either in NCWTS or NXS in  then move to either full time NXS or NSCS in .Just guessing me and a buddy have been talking about this for a while now.

But if youre trying to attract younger folks a Chevy SS a Ford Fusion and Toyota Camry are not cool  cars. To me Nascar should be about stock cars...and a series like TUDOR understands that a hell of alot better than Nascar dies which blows my mind since that series is run by Nascar. An oval version of the GTLM or GTD is what I think Nascar should be and itd be amazing.  Theoretically I can go buy an Audi Ra Chevy Corvette Porsche etc at the dealership and it looks more or less like the car they race. The cup cars look nothing like their Street car counterparts. Think of how cool it was the other day to see the Porsche bump drafting the Corvette through the trioval.

3040742,0,t1_cod5g3k,My thoughts exactly. The tire changers are used to doing all five. Also  using  lugnuts on one stop may screw up the rhythm of the next stop.,NASCAR,cod670j,5,t5_2qs08
3041146,0,t1_cocvkfr,To me theres a whole lot more to racing than just passing for the lead. When yellows start coming out for questionable reasons and the order gets all shuffled around because of race control and not because of actual on track passing it cheapens the race for me. Im not trying to say that I like boring races. Watching someone destroy the field can be entertaining in its own way however Id much prefer a super close edge of your seat race. The thing is that just cant happen every weekend. If I pay to see a  mile race I want to see a  mile race. Not a  mile parade a debris caution to bunch up the field for a close finish and then a  mile sprint. I almost feel robbed as a fan when the happens. I spend a lot of money to see a race and I know going into it that one driver could very well destroy the field and if thats what happens naturally then so be it.Maybe Im a little bit crazy but what Im trying to say is that I dont prefer boring racings. I dont want a race to be boring. But I would rather see a race where one driver dominates than a race thats only exciting or close because of race manipulation. I guess you and I are just different in that sense.,NASCAR,cod7pj8,3,t5_2qs08

3169319,0,t1_coqhp6h,I would totally be down to do this but Im not sure we have enough people to participate to do it unfortunately. The way we could make it work is if we have merch to sell again. I think the only reason the last tshirt sales didnt go as well was due to the fact it was the same tshirt design. I also think it was to close together to the other tshirt sales. I think the way to do it is to let the community vote on a design sell them then if it was succesful do it again half a year or a year later. This could work because people can afford  a year.

3181238,0,t1_cnptcnl,A small team does have issues when it comes to staffing. You do wear many hats even though you may not be qualified for those other positions. In this case I am the one though not in charge of hiring that was told to send out the rejectionreplies. I filled shoes that were to big I guess and there were errors. There were numerous other positions needed to be filled that resumes were sent in for and yes believe it or not there were  resumes sent in for all positions. It was time consuming to review all resumes but all resumes were reviewed. I would consider that a success!TMG lists with NASCAR Shop attrack PRAdmin and specialty Engineer positions as CREW.So though the rejectionreply was not in the best written form whether a person applied for general mechanic or administration everyone would be considered a crew member because it is a team.My suggestion would be not to attack someone personally and maybe send a follow up email asking what one may need to do to be on board with a team.I understand your frustration in the rejection I really do!I dislike having to reject anyone. Which is implied on another post why I am not a HR person. The  year experience for the Cup team comes into play because there are numerous differences in a CUP program than Xfinity and Truck Series and other series like ARCA IRL F etc.The knowledge set ups understanding the Pull Down Rig shockspring packages and Bump Stops etc needs to already be known. Any form of RACING is about time.A small team needs to save as much time and someone with  year experience can save a lot of time rather than someone who needs to learn the tasks.Though many teams including the TOP TIER teams use interns to learn these tasks so that they may one day be apart of a team.My opinion and this may sound like an HR person though as we have already cleared up I am notYou may also want to review your personality before applying to any further team.Attacking someone on Reddit is not professional something an engineer should be.I would consider doing the following which is like a lot of crew members have done to break into NASCAR.Dont be in in for the paycheck as you state. I understand we all need money but if you do it for love of the sport and remember why you wanted to be an engineer in the first place focus your time and efforts in making yourself better people will notice you on and off the track and you will gain position advancements and ultimately more money. But if youre trashing people even as something petty as posting on a message board under a Log In that isnt your real name well then you will never make it in this sport. Even if you have to be apart of a start and park team you should be apart of that team. As you can gain the experience that is needed to further your career in NASCAR. You will be in the garage mingling with other teams and giving you a chance to talk to them directly as you will be seeing them on a constant basis. Becoming involved entry level on a NASCAR team is very difficult to do especially in a paid position.Ask to be a volunteer and donate your spare time in learning what that organization is doing and what it needs and help them build the program better. And a majority of the time you will be hired on or you will now have the experience to go to another team with a resume with that needed experience. I am sorry that you felt they way you did against me but again I was only trying to help the team and I did what I was told.Best of luck to you and the other person that was rejected.,NASCAR,corqg71,1,t5_2qs08

Some level of in car adjustment is a standard in top level motorsports now not the other way around. Do I want to see driver adjustable differentials engine maps and fuel modes? No thats straying too far from the soul of stock car racing. But I think this is a step in the right direction to increasing competition and putting more control in a drivers hand to chase down another driver even after the last pitstop without making the pitcrew irrelevant during an event. They still cant adjust wedge or tire pressures or add spring rubbers on the go which can have an even larger effect on the car than the trackbar.And its a new piece of tech so its going to have gremlins.

It would be wrong for him to imprisoned based on the ruling of the family court judge but what the government may and may not do is different than what third parties may and may not do.  The government may not deprive him of his liberty without a criminal conviction.  NASCAR may decide that they agree with the family court ruling and that they dont want to be associated with someone who even probably did this.  Its up to them.  The bottom line is that theres a serious legal problem with prosecuting domestic violence and a fine line needs to be walked between imprisoning people without trial which would be wrong and deciding that anything that happens with no witnesses is effectively legal.,NASCAR,cp584ru,7,t5_2qs08

3342259,0,t3_2yg73c,I think theres not much more we should do to improve safety. We did enough. These cars are x safer than they were  years ago. The chance of anyone losing there life behind the wheel is slim to none. We made these cars bigger. I personally miss the pre car of tomorrow because these things are just aero machines that arent exactly as hard as they used to be to drive. These things need to be tougher to drive.  Like they were back in the good days of nascar. I could have worded this better but hopefully you guys see my point,NASCAR,cp98qc9,0,t5_2qs08
3342282,0,t1_cp985iv,. Is a non issue. All access to the points use an entrance similiar to this so unless a car is going backwards they arent hitting anything unprotected and there is no excuse for the access point to have SAFERs.Also the design on infield rovals usually prevents an end of a wall to be presented to an oncoming car. Indy has a curved wall on the inside of T on the F road course that could have SAFERs installed on it. Or it could be moar tires. Other rovals like Kansass or Daytonas you literally have to intentionally brake and steer towards the unprotected entrance to hit anything unprotected. Prototypes have enough issue missing their braking point in T and sliding in to the oval wallsrunoff let alone a Cup car accidentally ending up in the infield area. The exit of Daytona uses a protruding wall like safety vehicles use to shield the exit.,NASCAR,cp98tqu,2,t5_2qs08

3343477,0,t3_2yguaj,In this case I think its pretty much all about the money.  When Nextel was willing to step up and pay for the Cup naming rights they probably said something like Well give you XX Bajillion dollars as long as you dont allow other mobile carriers on cars grandfathering sponsors that are currently here.  Because it was NASCARs best deal they took it.  I expect the same thing will happen based on whoever steps up next with a few exceptions.  Some industries wont mind as much I would think but if is anything like the cell phone business Id expect the same clauses to be a part of the companys bid.In terms of the teamsetc  Yes it would be better to not have those types of clauses but when NASCAR is looking for the whole series sponsor and they have someone who is willing to pay the s they want theyll accept that and say Tough Noogies Team whoever youre grandfathered in for now but if your sponsor changes names theyre out.,NASCAR,cp9dqdy,5,t5_2qs08

3551387,0,t1_cpwz747,the problem with this issue that most Americans dont know about is that the origin of this bill was because a woman who owned a baker was asked to make a wedding cake for a gay couple. due to her religious beliefs she declined because she didnt want to take part in something she doesnt approve of. the couple then sued her and i believe won because of that. that action from the couple is much worse than the initial declining to do the cake being that it potential can financially ruin that woman for the rest of her life. just as gay people have had certain beliefs attempted to be forced on to them they then went and did the same thing but worse thus causing the bill and the situation we are in now.

However the gay community has basically made this into a publicity soap box and the entire country is now in an uproar even though probably less than  percent have even looked at the law that was actually signed... Many people are saying this gives business owners a right to discriminate against whoever they please but without good backed up faith and religious beliefs the state will not defend them. So everyone is in an uproar Indy is getting screwed for protecting a new minority of people who think differently than the gay community everyone is losing their minds. Its really freaking stupid.

If they made a move with  laps to go and got freight trained they would have had zero chance of winning. Making a move with  to go is the absolute last moment they could do something and still have a chance to win. They minimized risk by waiting until the very last second.It made for crappy racing but these things happen from time to time. Happened in the trucks at Daytona in February. Sucks for the fans but I cant fault the drivers in the top  for not making a move.Im kinda surprised that not more people got on the Tony Stewart train with about  to go.

4286856,1,t1_cs8ro7c,That clear shark fin in the back of the car has a huge impact on the crappy racing lately. Remove that entirely and reduce the side force numbers in the back. It will make front downforce not as important. Reduce the allowable radiator pressures to something like  psi. They would have to open up all those stock grills to keep that engine cool. Add the horsepower back to the cars. Because why not this is the top series. They will get hotter now anyway. Radiator cap Remove the front splitter. And have a rule that states under full compression of all four corners of the suspension the body and frame of the car must not sit lower than  inches or whatever. Chop another  inches from the rear spoiler of the car. Make the tires  more narrow. This will all equal the searly s style racing. Make the teams focus on mechanical grip.  seems to be my magical number. I hope somebody from NASCAR sees this post that can do something about it. Edit Forgot words.

4377764,0,t1_csinwml,A dive bomb in my opinion suggests that when done the driver could not have otherwise held their inside line at the speed they entered.  However it seems that from the video Montoya was able to stay low at that speed and he held his line inside.  Montoyas car did not push away from the line he took.  Had his car pushed and squeezed into the outside line then I would agree that he dive bombed and had to expect to hit Pruett.  I guess I am saying that a dive bomb as I understood it suggests that there was a decision to intentionally take the corner at such a speed that the inevitable result or at least most likely result would be contact.  Im not saying Montoya did not assume some risk by putting a nose in so late but I actually believe that he assumed that Pruett was going wide to keep the advantage for the next turn not that he was going to turn wide to cut deep.  It looked like a definite error on Montoyas part as he was the one that caused contact to a car ahead of him but that is not to say that it was done intentionally or that he acted in such a way without good intent.  I say ALL THAT but understand I am not exactly a fan of Montoyas racing.  ,NASCAR,csj3yfo,1,t5_2qs08

If the US hosts were to constantly trash Ford cars for whatever reason on the show then Ford would not advertise on the show anymore and would be a huge financial hit for the show. So they had to placate their sponsors while also trying to come off as unbiased which is very difficult to do. This imo anyway is what made the UK version so good. Yes Clarkson May and Hammond have amazing chemistry together but you can always find a trio with good chemistry.

I still think thats an irrelevant piece of information. Its funny that you had to throw that in because you think it changes anything of fans knowing who Josh Wise actually is.

4645434,0,t1_ctg32i6,I see a big reason for it get drivers accustomed to the level of competition.Honestly at first I was going to compare it to AA AAA and MLB baseball but Ill use a different example.In technology when a company moves from an old system to a new system they phase in the new system. They dont just turn off the old system and go to the new system but rather they slowly transition from the old system to the new system.Its the same with Cup drivers in Xfinity. If you have a young talented driver Ty Dillon for example you start him in trucks. You see how he races against truck veterans and Cup regulars. Does he look good? Alright lets move him up to Nationwide. The competition is closer and hes racing against more Cup regulars. Is he looking good? Alright lets throw him in a couple of Cup races. Look good? Alright now were confident about moving him to a Cup car.tldr  Cup drivers in Xfinity helps gauge how well a new driver will perform on the next level.

4646266,0,t1_ctg7za9,gt then its not that impressive and it steals the attention and focus off of the series regulars.I dont know winning any race at the national level in NASCAR is impressive no matter how good you are or if youre in the truck seriesxfinity seriescup series. I know Kyle Busch has made it look like winning the truck race is too easy and some races it has been for him but his team and him have still had to work hard to get where they are and to be such a dominant force. I dont think it steals any attention or focus off the regulars because numerous times throughout the races and broadcasts they point out how well some of the regulars and underfunded teams are running compared to the cup affiliated teams. Guys like Jeremy Clements Ryan Sieg JJ Yeley the entire JGL Racing team actually are keeping the series relevant because of how well they do with so little. An educated fan that actually enjoys NASCAR knows that a Cup guy winning the Xfinity race doesnt take any focus off the smaller teams or the up and coming young guns or the regulars just racing each and every week.,NASCAR,ctg858c,2,t5_2qs08

5165534,0,t1_cv8jkhq,gt Agreed but were also not talking about Jr. Johnson or Kenseth Yeah but what does it matter? You look at guys like Johnson and Stewart both basically started in stock cars after their th birthday. They obviously had racing experience elsewhere Johnson in offroad Stewart in openwheel but those are very different racing disciplines then NASCAR but they were able to come in at a later age and pick it up and they now have  championships between them. Im not suggesting that Jeffrey Earnhardt is going to be a big success but rather that his age is not necessarily going to doom his career. I dont think theres any reason that even in todays NASCAR that a driver with enough talentbacking couldnt pick up stock car racing in their late s and go on to have a very productive NASCAR career. I think its clear most people doubt that he has the talent and he most certainly wont be able to do much with the team hes signed on with even if he did have the talent. ,NASCAR,cv8mz8g,2,t5_2qs08

Ken Schrader made a point of apologizing to everyone before Martinsville and Bristol so its hard to imagine anyone getting mad at him. Kyle Larson hasnt won yet but he also hasnt made enemies and the list of fellow drivers who think highly of him is made of champions and legends. Youve got  drivers who are showing up every weekend and practicing qualifying and racing together  weeks of the year. Eventually everyones going to have a little friction with at least some of the others they work with same as you probably do at your job. Its the ones that get into it for multiple races in a season or multiple races in a row that are unusual. A great example would be Tony Stewart and David Gilliland. Tony picked on him after a wreck that Tony thought was Davids fault but the very next year picked Gilliland to be his drafting partner at both the restrictor plate tracks when the tandem draft was the fastest way around the track.

Also once the chase starts any driver that get passed by the leader under green flag running barring a pitstop involved has to park it. This eliminates lap down cars getting in the way....

5870302,1,t3_3vnw9p,Oh boy....here we go. Trevor Bayne is a very talented driver who could probably pull off  or so wins if he gets a good car. His results in Roush handmedowns were very good. What Matt Kenseth did at Martinsville was worse than what Kyle Busch did to Ron Hornaday and what Gordon did to Bowyer. Likewise anyone who cheered when Kenseth did that doesnt know what real racing is. I dont hate the new Chase format. Kyle Busch deserved every bit of that Championship. After all the shit he went through to get it I dont see any reason why he doesnt deserve it. Plate races are insanely difficult. They just require a different type of skill. Fake debris cautions are a myth. Mostly. There is some evidence suggesting NASCAR does that but not enough. That graph that supposedly proves it kind of defeats its purpose when the cautions started rising in  After  deaths from  and for whatever reason it went down from . What was so special about those seasons? Both Dillons will be Sprint Cup Champions. NASCARs inconsistency in penalties while annoying is nothing new. Two examples I can think of Mark Martin gets  points taken away from something in a gray area loses Championship because of it. Gordon uses basically an illegal car at Charlotte just told to not bring it back. Ricky Rudd turns around Davey Allison at Sonoma to win stripped of win. Dale Earnhardt does the same thing MANY times not once is he penalized.  Jeff Gordon is not a  time Champion. He is a  time Champion. Get over it. Speaking of Jeff in my opinion he is the greatest driver in NASCAR history. In his prime no driver would have any chance of beating him. Some of the stats he put up are just insane. I mean  wins in  races? Thats never going to be topped. Jimmie Johnsons  championships mean more than Richard Pettys  and even Earnhardts  to an extent. He did it in the most competitive era in NASCAR. The points systems have no part in this. There are a fuckton of double standards here. Kenseths thing with Logano was similar to Gordons thing with Bowyer. Both had prior incidents that could be blamed on the latter and the former smashed the other into a wall and ruined their season. Everyone except for some Gordon fans thought what Jeff did was bullshit including me. But  of the people here think what Kenseth did was acceptable. Why is it ok for Matt to do that and not Kenseth? I know why Its Joey Logano. If it was any other driver except for Keselowski and maybe Kyle Busch everyone would be calling for Kenseths head on a pike. Everyone HATES Logano and I have no clue why. Speaking of which nobody saw an issue with Allmendinger laying back on restarts to get ahead. That won him a race at the Glen and nearly got him a win at Martinsville. But the Penske guys do it and its apparently terrible. Why is it ok for AJ to do that and not the Penske guys? Once again its the Penske guys. Thats why people see an issue with it. Their hatred blinds them. And finally nobody here hesitates to say Bayne and Stenhouse are horrible drivers with no talent though everyone here has no issue saying Danica will be a Sprint Cup winner. Even though Bayne and Stenhouse have won races while Danica has not and those two beat Danica quite a bit in much worse cars than what Danica has. Kyle Busch said that NASCAR sometimes penalizes drivers because of who the driver is and that has definitely happened before. But NASCAR fans do the same thing. The general opinion on something is based on who is involved. Edit A few more Just because the racing at a track isnt particularly exciting doesnt mean it shouldnt be on the schedule.  A one win or no win champion should not be possible in any series. Even though I have no respect for him because he beat up his wife Travis Kvapfil never got a fair chance. Oh and Kurt fans? Fontana was  months ago. Get over it. Youre getting as bad as Gordon fans.,NASCAR,cxp4m49,16,t5_2qs08

I think NASCAR permitted the  teams of this year and last to run a setup or use a parts that gave the car an advantage which does not adhere to the official rule book. Businesses like NASCAR sometimes have to do things on the down low for the greater good or success of the company and to think NASCAR wouldnt resort to doing something like this to increase television viewership and attendance at the actual race is in my opinion a little farfetched.I too would like to believe that the competition is as fair as it can possibly be and a lot of times it is but in a case like this the majority of this sub along with a large part of NASCARs fan base overall is in agreement that it isnt.,NASCAR,d002dq1,2,t5_2qs08

6761964,0,t1_d09n20j,Im intent on calling you out for calling a driver out who is doing better than a lot of other drivers with full time rides.  As for Bubba he was stellar in trucks but faltered in Xfinity and he hasnt had a major sponsor hop on board.  Until he proves something in a car I dont see him getting offered a ride regardless.  I think he WILL do it sooner rather than later but his racing career of any type is rather short yet.I wouldnt dismiss any you would say I would debate you on them agree or disagree and tell you why.What I wont do is sit around and listen to people bash on Danica complaining shes holding up other drivers but those same people wont say a word about the dozen other drivers who are worse than she is.  Danica has the money and the skills to back her up.  Has she done craptastic?  Sometimes.  Is she holding up other drivers?  No more than anyone else who finished nd or worse last year.  Thats what I take issue with.  There are a ton of drivers who should be losing their rides to new faces before she even enters the conversation.  So the only explanation is that it IS about women.  So if its not feel free to expand on why you chose her but dont mention the others.  Austin finished close to her hes got a top ride.  Trevor Bayne though seems a rather nice guy is in a top ride  did worse than her.  I think RPM is on an upswing  so Hornish is there did worse than her.  So there are good teams out there who arent faring like her.As for Johanna Long shes not ready.  She needs to get a mentor stat.  Shes got the chops but doesnt seem to know what to do with them.  Not sure if its her being timid or the equipment or the crew or a combo.As I argued otherwise I desperately want some new fresh blood in the sport.  Im tired of family dynasties where the current generation is not all that spectacular but is much lauded.  I just dont see anyone on the horizon.  My best argument was Brian Scott who hasnt won in Xfinity but was in the points chase for most of the year until he went all out.  Barring a bad block strategy at Daytona which I was in the infield for he would have had the win there.  But he got a ride.  Suarez is possibly the next in line for a fulltime ride.  I think hell do well.  He is ready for a fulltime ride.  But Id see him step in for Biffle before Danica if we go with a top team.  Frankly my own animosity towards Bowyer means Id also rather see Suarez take Tonys spot but Ill at least say Biffle didnt do as bad as Danica.So I ask again  who exactly would be ready for a ride that is taken up by Danica?  Youd need a list of about  to touch where shes been performing maybe  if you go with additional potential.  Maybe  if you toss in sponsor dollars.,NASCAR,d0iqvyi,1,t5_2qs08

Even though BK isnt great kinda happy he is there sorta as he and Matt and really help that team. My favorite driver before was Joe Nemechek. Started cheering for him cause he was a local guy. Never was fanatsic in Cup but still always had good run with some not great teams. Im still sad about . Best car he ever drove IMO  in the  was very close.

6973492,0,t3_4b59y5,Xfinity series is professional racing. Its not kiddy league basketball where teams get separated by age and skill level so everybody has a chance to get a trophy. The best driver is going to win a lot and lead a lot of laps.  If you think thats a huge problem that needs to be fixed it sounds to me like you just dont like the fundamental concept of racing. Maybe you should watch th grade basketball instead.What you said about TV ratings  do people watch Xfinity just because Kevin Harvick is in it? No youre right. Do they watch just because of Joey Logano? No. They watch because its Kevin Harvick AND Joey Logano AND Kyle Busch AND Brad Keselowski AND Austin Dillon and they get to see how the new drivers stack up against the best.  Just because you dont buy it doesnt mean it isnt true.Besides its not just the TV ratings. Its sponsorship deals. Getting a full time sponsor for an upandcoming kid that nobody has ever heard of in a series with low TV ravings is really hard to do. But if that kid is splitting time in the car with with a Cup series celebrity it makes it a lot easier.  Teams need stability or the whole series crumbles apart.,NASCAR,d16s6p6,-2,t5_2qs08

You just dont go from winning championships to having no top fives last year.  Hes still a great driver.You have to take into consideration that Tony has been racing for nearly  years.  Think of all the laps and the hits that hes taken.  Physical and mental abuse late in ones career does no one any good.  Look at how bad Kobe did on his way out though he did well in his last game.Tony does so far seem better than last year Kansas was solid.

Roush was already struggling when Matt Kenseth and Carl Edwards were still driving Fords. Lets not forget that Roush has won way more races then SHR alltime and honestly Roush at their peak would make SHR the last few years look like Front Row Motorsports. Its not like Roush is some small team that is just having trouble getting it figured out. Roush has been building their own cars for decades SHR will be doing it basically starting from scratch next year. SHR will be getting their engines from the same place that Roush has. Its not like Roush doesnt have money behind them either.

And the report was buried in an opinion column and appeared to me at least to be more of a way to add color to his opinion as opposed to an outright breaking news report. We can argue until the sun comes up over whether or not this kind of citizen journalism should co exist with so called real journalism but I find it odd that people like Gluck are shocked that a citizen journalism site is posting rumors. Shouldnt an experienced journalist be able to differentiate between the two?This kind of stuff isnt going away. Its the new normal and we both know it.

It was put in place immediately after the Richmond incident and has generated only scorn every time its been mentioned because it is as you said entirely subjective. I think that it would be ridiculous for them to bring out any lasting penalties for the AllStar race unless Loganos car is found to be outside of the rules. The race was total chaos. Nobody knew what they were doing and were making calls as they went along.The only reason I would ever see the  rule being a good thing to whip out is when a driver stalls without mechanical problem or spins themselves out at a time that a caution is vastly advantageous for themselves or a teammate.After all if it was strict back when lapleading points mattered worth a darn we wouldnt have seen that teammates agreement to swap the lead for just a lap or two.,NASCAR,d3gc0he,6,t5_2qs08

Their demo fits perfect with the NASCAR fanbase. Theyll be missed but according to the same reporter JGR has another deal expected to be announced soon.

7928596,0,t3_4nvhbe,I do think that theres this weird thing missing from the race to chase.  But I dont think it has anything to do with the top .  I think its more about the fact that win and your in.People were complimenting Kyle Busch on his interview yesterday.  Why would he be upset?  Ever since he won at Martinsville he was good to go.  And he has two other wins so he is insured.  Hamlins had some issues.  But that Daytona  win which seems like a distant memory at this point allows him to not care as much.I actually like this chase format overall because quite frankly it is more exciting.   But I think what they should do is make win your in for people outside the top  in points.  So say if Hamlin dropped out of the top  he would have top drop to st to make the chase.  But if he stayed in the top  hed have to get back in.  Its been interesting to see drivers the last few years be outside the top  in points and make the chase so keep that.  But make it harder for the guys higher up in points.,NASCAR,d478yrt,-1,t5_2qs08

8238493,0,t1_d57bzpt,The idea behind lower DF is to kill the clean air phenomenon. That is the primary goal behind every DF reduction to allow a faster car to pass a slower car. The tricky part is balancing the downforce to get the desired reduction in clean air without killing the cars stability. The low low DF package failed miserably in this regard and by my view actually made the clean air advantage stronger because the aero balance was off.TL DR this stuff is mighty complicated,NASCAR,d57d8v7,2,t5_2qs08

8534304,0,t1_d68c1yz,How was it not smart? The move AJ was attempting to do had been done successfully plenty of times throughout the race and AJ definitely had a run on him. The difference is that Truex had just spun out Larson was able to spot it before AJ or before AJs spotter told him about it and Larson didnt exit the corner in the normal line swinging out towards the outside wall and thats what caused AJ to get into him. ,NASCAR,d68cqix,5,t5_2qs08
8535574,0,t1_d68fm6u,AJ didnt know Truex had spun out. By the time he realized Truex had spun it was already too late and backing off the gas wouldnt have done anything. He fully expected Larson to continue with his normal exit and since Larson couldnt continue to go to they outside on  the exit of the corner AJ bumped him. Also its the final corner on the final lap and they were both racing for a position and also racing to try to get into the Chase. No driver in AJs position would lift off the gas right there including Larson. ,NASCAR,d68ih84,2,t5_2qs08

Hes shown flashes here and there but hes mostly in the position hes in because he typically doesnt race that aggressive and as a result he doesnt have many bad finishes. Austin seems to care more about not wrecking rather than pushing the equipment most likely because that would lead to a lot more mistakes therefore a lot worse finishes.

They still kicked ass in  and had a pretty nice little year last year. The affiliation with ToyotaGibbs has only cranked them up another notch.They even managed to win with fucking Regan Smith. Kurt Busch had a damn good year there and basically resurrected his career there in .I mean really.....what the fuck??? How are they doing it? Its truly amazing in this day and age of NASCAR. Its great for the sport.

8654320,0,t3_4yenws,My personal opinion is to go and spend as much time there as you can.Heres a copypaste that Ive posted to rnascar before...  A hotpass gets you access to the garage and pit road during the race weekend.This basically means you get to walk through the area in which they park the haulers and along the garage areas where they work on the cars.  You should not actually walk into the garages itself unless invited by a teamcrew member.  You also get to walk around the pit lane during the race a short distance behind the teamstirespit boxes normally they have a painted line they ask you not to cross in order to give the crew guys space to work and move around behind the pit box  dont cross this line unless invited by a crew member.Tips for your hotpass I always post these when folks get a hotpass for the first time Dont get hit.  Sounds simple...  but keep your head on a swivel and dont get hit by the race cars.  Dont get hit by pit carts and equipment  and stay out of the way of the crew guys!  Be aware of your surroundings at all times and do your best to stay out of the way. Youre walking in the office of hundreds of crew members.  This is no different than if they were to get a pass to walk into your cubicle at work while youre on the phone and working on your TPS reports.  Its no different than someone walking through the kitchen of an Applebees.  No different than someone checking out the assembly line of the local car assembly line.  People work there youre a guest. Have fun!  Bring a camera!  Take tons of photos!  Bring or buy a hat or something from the track to get autographed if you get the chance to meet some of the drivers!  Dress codes have changed  and they do now allow shorts but I personally still recommend wearing pants and a polo if these are clothes youre comfortable wearing.  When I go to a race I wear kahkis and a lightweight golf polo personally.  It just looks more professional and you look like you belong versus wearing jean shorts and a ratty tshirt.  Again these are MY personal preferences here. DONT GET HIT again  I only repeat this as Ive seen someone get hit shoved or yelled at to move at the last minute at several of the NASCAR races Ive been to in the garage.  Like I said keep checking behind you and pay attention.  Dont walk along the side of the isle by the garage openings  as cars will pull in and back out quickly  walk on the side opposite to the garage stalls.  Its not just race cars youre looking out for  watch for pit carts fuel carts tire carts golf carts... you get the picture... Get there early check the NASCAR schedule to see what time the garage opens  thats when you can get there.  You dont need to wait until closer to race time  and the garage is less crowded during the earlier hours. Again.... have fun and we rnascar expect pictures when you get home.  Remember not a lot of people have access to hotpasses so enjoy it!,NASCAR,d6nekkm,3,t5_2qs08

I was able to experience the inside of a drivers hauler pit road the garage and the national anthem and prayer right next to a car on pit road. Ryan is an amazing driver who truly appreciates his fans and is just an awesome guy plus a reddit user responsible for introducing us to DiBurrito.I will be going back tomorrow to Darlington tomorrow.

Carls a great driver and qualifier and often the other JGR teams will use parts of the s setup. Truex straight up used the s setup at Loudon and pretty much dominated. Kyle complained about the s spring setup at Bristol right before the car went to shit. The same happened at Las Vegas when the  car qualified th they just used Carls setup and would have stolen the race had Kyle not gotten a vibration. Theyre champion caliber but either Carls overdriving or Dave Rogers is the JGR equivalent to Keith Rodden.,NASCAR,d7bbyjz,1,t5_2qs08

He doesnt drive like hes playing a video game. If youre going to try to make that argument about any truck drivers this year itd be Christopher Bell and Ben Rhodesthough except for Bristol Bell has done much better since the early part of the year. If JHN is a dirty driver who clearly has a long history of racing dirty then provide some actual examples of him racing dirty. Not cases where he got loose under someone because the air was taken off the truck but actual examples of dirty racing. Only time that comes close is Pocono with really aggressive blocking but everyone in that race was doing the same because you had to to fight to keep your position with how big of an effect the draft had on the trucks.,NASCAR,d7d8ubq,3,t5_2qs08

8989226,0,t3_53av0s,My buddy and I have been keeping a spreadsheet to track our top  drivers in each race. We made it a rule that were only allowed to change  driver per month although we often dont anyway. Another rule is that we have our drivers locked in for the Chase.So that said theres at least two of us without  specific favourite driver. We enjoy watching the races each week and this gives us a chance for friendly competition.

8997715,0,t3_53im01,See heres my problem with all of this. Theres too much personality in nascar and not enough racing.  People care too much about their specific drivers and not the sport as a whole so the integrity is in question.. its why we have a ton of question marks at the top of the subreddit now even though we know full well NASCAR wont do anything.If NASCAR really cared about the racing this would be an obvious answer for them.  In almost every other sport if you play with illegal equipment  or are an ineligible player you are disqualified and cannot win.  In many cases your team is disqualified. In some sports they come back after the fact and disqualify teams even teams that win championships.But not in NASCAR because people dont want their precious little feelings hurt.  In NASCAR we cant disqualify Martin because gosh hes just such a hero and the cancer story and he has fans and people DID see a good race right and we just cant hurt their iddle feelings.    Theyre stupid fans anyway they wont GET that a disqualification means the nd place person actually won.   Plus nobody really likes Joey Logano because of the Matt Kenseth thing so I mean passing HIM through? So yes.  If NASCAR wants to be serious adult racing it will react like a serious adult racing series would.  But it wont.  It never will.  It is HAPPY to be a series of personalities and not a series of racing and when youre a series of personalities you have to protect those personalities and not the racing.,NASCAR,d7tdwip,112,t5_2qs08

So you have one car dedicated to it one motor and maybe  guys which can help train or do RampD.  We were rolling the backup car out of the trailer to do it sometimes so its not like we were bringing a second set of equipment.So you dont have enough funding for the whole race so we would run  laps then go to the garage with an issue  If a bunch of people crashed out we might try and go out and snipe a few more spots.Lets be honest NASCAR doesnt care about the small teams so unless we were doing blatant things once got hit for not setting the pits up before the race so i mean you knew we were parking they didnt really care.,NASCAR,d7z3jv8,51,t5_2qs08

9231650,0,t1_d8m3v6p,Yeah thats one of the things thats so crazy about our sport is the randomness of it all.  Harvick was in a win or go home situation at Phoenix and he wins and it sets up for a finale where at least myself and maybe many others just felt like man he deserves this not just for winning PHX which lets face it is old hat for KH but for all the times he missed out on the Cup at RCR for one reason or another etc. and if one thing about that PHX race had gone differently someone else likely would have been the champ. and  for Kyle I mean the story was just incredible with his comeback and everything but had one little thing here or there gone differently no big story no redemption etc. and I know the  championship will be debated til the cows come home with how much of the season he missed etc. but I  feel like he deserved it based on how he drove for the portion of the season where he was physically able to do so. I know deservedness doesnt really count for much in terms of lap times but something about this random universe does seem to reward those racers that truly deserve it at least for  Cup Championship and I have a weird feeling that for some reason that Denny and MTJ definitely deserve it this year. But they did both finish pretty poorly yesterday so maybe Im full of it lol.,NASCAR,d8m6go6,1,t5_2qs08

9351013,0,t1_d919lfb,Yep its difficult for the smaller teams tremendously at first and it might kill some of the back of the pack competition for a while even worse than it is now but after a while it will pick back up. Best thing I can compare this to is ARCA since Im more familiar with that and the combination of the universal Ilmor engine and composite bodies is really hurting a lot of small teams now but it will be a tremendous help in a year or two there. Xfinity doesnt have the expense that is the new engine but there is a good chance it could kill the smallest teams barely hanging on right now with the composite body. On the bright side though once those composite body cars start to be discarded by top teams in a few years business will pick back up and well start to see more small teams that are more competitive than the current small teams. ARCAs experiencing the desertion now car counts have been pretty rough the past few years compared to the late s and the s.

9538153,0,t1_d9oro2e,Yeah I just saw other comments saying that.  Google turned up this explanation which seems pretty interesting.  Is this generally accurate?gtThe Parabolica and that picture of sports cars at Rockingham are both NOT on ovals. At least Im assuming that sports car race was using the roval at Rockingham. Sure there are turns that are ovallike or part of an oval but thats not really understanding the problem...gtWith ovals that right front tire gets so much pressure on it when it goes through a turn. Think of the whole car as putting its weight on that tire because thats kind of what the GForces do to it. The inertia of the car wants to keep the car going straight instead of turning left. And the most prominent thing fighting that inertia is going to be the tire thats pulling against that force the most the tire which is bracing against that force the most... which is the rightfront. gtIts like standing on one leg. Most ablebodied people can stand on one leg for  seconds. Thats what racing in the rain on any road or street course is like. Youre exerting pressure on the tires but only for small amount of time. So the tire heats less so the tire blisters less so it maintains its tread more so it can plow through rain better.gtWith an oval its like standing on one leg for an hour. Youve gotta have a strong leg to do that. Thats what oval racing is like on that rightfront tire. Youre exerting extreme pressure on that tire in every corner. Every  seconds or so. So the tire heats more so the tire blisters more so it maintains less tread so it cannot plow through water as easily.gtBasically you can put a rightfront rain tire on a car at an oval. Its just going to turn into a slick in a short amount of time because the rubber of the treading is going to blister fall off and smooth the tire out.,NASCAR,d9ory10,1,t5_2qs08

For your flair on the sidebar of the subreddit below the subscribe buttons should be your username and a button saying edit next to it. Click that and select one and boom you have a flair. For your driver Id suggest watching a few races and making that decision based on who catches your eye. Homestead may not be the best race to do so in as most drivers give the championship contenders more room than normal as to not interfere with the championship race but by a few races in to next season or if you watch replays of races from this season you should get a general idea of their personalities and driving ability rather quickly. ,NASCAR,da0r1t4,1,t5_2qs08

9990440,0,t3_5ioo9x,I think so.  Although his final stats five wins with only one on a track longer than a mile pale next to most Hall of Famers I think his contributions to the sport go beyond his ontrack performance.  Kulwicki also brought a number of innovations to the sport in terms of engineering and technology.  He was one of the first drivers to embrace physical fitness as part of his daytoday routine and encourage his employees to do the same.  More importantly Kulwicki pretty much out of necessity paid particular attention to the business side of the sport.  Most drivers chided him for carrying a briefcase everywhere he went including the Winston Cup garage. He stayed in close contact with his sponsors and carefully monitored every detail of his various contracts.Today of course most of the drivers have business agents to handle this stuff for them.  Jimmie Johnson even maintains a residence in New York City to be in close contact with sponsors and the media  following the lead of his mentor Jeff Gordon.  Im sure other folks in the sport do the same.  A whole new era was opening up in the sport from the late s to early s.  Alan Kulwicki was only starting to lead the way when he left us.,NASCAR,db9s5qs,39,t5_2qs08

Hopefully this prevents longer rain delays there wont be rain seeping into the cracks anymore hopefully even though it dried relativley fast considering how old the surface is.Cons unless they use the same surface card wont be sliding around. assuming the cars will not slide around anymore it will make the race much less interesting.They should make it a night race again but have it start under sunlight as it transitions into a night race that could make things interesting basically make it the CocaCola  or the Coke Zero  maybe that would make things interesting.,NASCAR,dbyb6ky,3,t5_2qs08

10427225,0,t3_5pba66,Is everybody from the North here? MIS can get hot in the summers but its nothing unbearable.Usually when its hot they have the mist sprayers going for people to cool down. Just stay hydrated and use sunscreen and you will be fine.The souvenir village is worth checking out. Lots of people with tents on the opposite site of the track selling TONS of stuff. Usually slightly cheaper than the stuff inside the track and far more vintage and offensive apparel amp collectibles.Would suggest bringing in both food amp beer in a soft cooler. Beer  MIS was either  or  for a  oz of BUD and the food was pretty bad.Racing at MIS has been so mixed over the years. Really enjoyed the xfinity amp truck race last year. The  August race that Kenseth won was incredibly boring but im pretty sure thats when they were trying a high downforce package and nobody could pass.Seating preferences really depends on the person. Youll need to go up quite a few rows if you want to be able to see the whole track at any given point of time. With the speeds they get up to though being right next to the track down by turn one really gets you a feel for the power I LOVE THE POWER!.Lastly the people at MIS are great. You get a lot of canadians and people from wisconsin who are all very friendly.

People need to realize you can dick around with the points format and people will be pissed some will leave etc so far we sure havnt gained any of those fabled new fans but we. its all monday through thursday talk. its noise. its background. its a framing device. we can ignore it we can deal with it... This changes the product itself. This changes what we are watching not just the way people talk about it. This is different. This WILL cause a lot of people to reevaluate if it is worth their time and money.Ultimately I wont be going to the track this year to see  short races. If im going to see  short races Ill watch them at my local track instead. NASCARs prestige is going to take a huge hit on this one more so than any boneheaded point scheme will. Like i said whatever. You guys can hate on me but im not alone and thats a problem for you and NASCAR whether you want to admit it or not. To be fair the COT knocked me out of NASCAR for  years it was only in  that I wandered back into following it. Again that fundamentally changed the racing on Sundays...

10466627,0,t3_5psu5q,Back in the day when Speed Channel showed old Daytona s the weeks leading up to the Daytona  Id watch and be amazed at how much had changed over the years.For example back in the day... No speed limit on pit road Crew members didnt wear helmets Crew members didnt wear fireresistant suits Drivers had no head or neck restraints and barely had helmets. Singlefile restarts with slowlapped cars on the inside line and lead lap cars on the outside line. No SAFR barriers so when cars wrecked they hit concrete walls. Cars raced back to the startfinish line during Yellow flag even if there was debris or a wrecked car on the track ahead of them.I remember when the no racing back to the startfinish was instituted.  Dale Jarretts  was wrecked and sitting in the middle of the track on the front stretch as the entire field came barreling at him at full speed.  While many of the safety improvements NASCAR has implemented I would consider a good thing but I think NASCARs meddling has swung too far the other way.,NASCAR,dcuhyy4,1,t5_2qs08

Why pay m for one car per year when Monster only pays m for the entire series? A source within the garage on RacingForums.com same guy who leaked Carl Edwards retiring predicts that even the rich teams like Penske will only be able to bring in sponsorship in the m range in the near future about half what they get now. Whether they actually cut back spending  or just backfill with these oneoff tiny sponsors is another matter. The contraction is coming folks. ,NASCAR,de2goqt,9,t5_2qs08
10886157,0,t3_5vkotb,I think it depends on how honest the drivers are in their assessments. As we have seen in the NFL it is possible for players with minor concussions to say the right things in order to pass the tests and get back on the field. So it wouldnt surprise me if some of the drivers who feel like their rides arent necessarily guaranteed or were in the midst of a championship battle learned the right things to say to avoid being kept out of the car. However drivers like Dale Jr. who know they will not lose their ride by taking a couple weeks to heal up will probably approach the tests with more sincerity. So overall I would take the under. I dont see it happening more than once. ,NASCAR,de2tvhk,2,t5_2qs08

I think you can make the argument that Chad Knaus might be the most innovative mind in NASCAR history when you consider that he has found a way to make his cars better than everyone elses even with the most constrictive rules in NASCARs history. Lots of people make the argument that NASCAR engineers are somehow inferior because they are limited by such a stringent rule book as opposed to F where there is so much more technology and much fewer limits. But I think that it takes more genius to find an advantage within a strict set of rules than it does to come up with something to make a car go faster when you have a much more wide open canvas to work with. ,NASCAR,dedgj94,11,t5_2qs08

Grass is never going to stop a car dead like a wall will so the G forces of the impact will be much lower.  Finally as bad as flips look they too scrub a ton of speed off normally plus the spinning sends force away from the driver instead of toward the driver.

Also Stages and the minute repair rule are gone.  Part of why this exists is because cars that take so long to repair are going to be well off the pace and using that logic would eliminate a good deal of the field from even starting..

None of us have any power to change things and NASCAR conducts fan surveys to see whats need so it becomes tiresome to see the same topics again and again.Regarding your tire compound paragraph.  F and Indycars have half the cars and each car uses half the tires of a NASCAR.  Goodyear cant afford to make that many tires as they already have to do specific compounds for almost every track.I agree that we need more variety of tracks but Talladega Charlotte and Daytona are the first that should be cut to one race each.

I know for them they just dont have enough time in the day for it.,NASCAR,dgu0oel,16,t5_2qs08

If you start accelerating too early youll be going too fast. If you start too late you have to try to make up for it which is an inexact science.,NASCAR,dgye8wb,1,t5_2qs08
