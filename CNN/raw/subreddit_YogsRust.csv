7703408,0,t3_4kt14q,Sorry to see you go Chef I realise there is no convincing you otherwise so well have to meet again next wipe.Im going to write a long ass post tonight concerning KOS Griefing and overall encouragement of RP.Im fully aware of the problems people have with the server however Im currently trying to appease the half that want bloodthirsty pvp and the half that want to make teletubbie land. Bare with me.A set of stricter rules should make the server a better place again.That being said if you decide to come back this wipe youll always have a space in our house and access to our resources to build the arena Chef  Id love to do it with you.,YogsRust,d3htr3v,1,t5_3ee30
7759477,0,t1_d3o61cp,And I have always felt that since that first iteration something has changed. That is still a systems problem. The whistlist has allowed  players to be able to play on this server. Barry hand picked out people in the first iteration instead of opening and closing the floodgates in these last few ones.Back then as well thing didnt just come about instantly like clans and groups do now. It was very natural and in its own ecosystem that people came together. With less people you can have that luxury. ,YogsRust,d3o6y9l,1,t5_3ee30

7813804,0,t1_d3tb1zf,Yeah for now that will be Rust.  Thrillhouse doesnt play Rust anymore he is all about Overwatch now with the rest of the Yogs.  Bah! p There will be a Best Of and there is also a music video coming but otherwise I am ready for a break from Rust.I will  return to Rust in the future for more fun and antics.  Game is in development so there will always be plenty to check out plus I didnt do nearly as much in the game as I wanted. gtlt,YogsRust,d3uc3lr,1,t5_3ee30

7921701,0,t3_4nrrt9,The problem with the idea is that when we do setup a base to act as storage points for the town. The large factions raid the shit out of us take our homes and blow them up. Making it impossible to run any shops in Barrington.You are basically saying why not force people to create places we can raid with lots of loot for us. The only reason nobody lives outside of the Barrington now is due to the large factions making it impossible to do so. The large factions dont raid each other so are now bored.Risk is one thing setting up a place that is going to  be raided the same night by the factions is totally pointless.It would be better just to hand the stuff over each night and save all the messing about having to raid and rebuild.,YogsRust,d46h2t5,3,t5_3ee30
7924504,0,t3_4nrrt9,Seriouly if you Rust is rust people cant get it through your thick heads that Rust is a goddamned sandbox and not your personal killing floor go fuck yourself.  If you cant understand that some people want to play games differently to you maybe you are the ones that need to change.  PVP is a PART of Rust it is not Rust.  If you looked at the new XP system and where endgame progession is leading you would realise that far more is intended for the game then just mindlesly raiding everyone which imo gets boring as fuck pretty quick.  The fun the rest of us have without PVP is the interactions and interesting stories people come up with as RP which leads to interesting interactions and events happening.  With well over  hours in this game these servers were the first time I have had fun in Rust in a bloody long time and Ill miss it but the current state of the server is at that point where it might as well devolve into a pubby server.dHonestly the best thing that could have happened is if all the KOSraid hungry peeps get one server and the RP guys get another but seeing as the server is basically dead anyways that aint gonna happen.  But honestly if anything Barrington should be expanded rather than restricted.  Make it more like a large town have a financial district open to all where trading and commerce happens open to the public and a residential walled off residential district just for the locals.  Nonraiding should still be a thing oth in nonparticipation and nonraidable.  Anyone wanting do do any serious business still has to leave town to gather whether it would be bps ore wood w.e. so there is still some danger involved but still allows an RP focus without too much grief from the PVP hordes.And just another note for you PVP is Rust guys Minecraft has PVP but it doesnt devolve into this sort of shitfest does it?  Play the game youre way Ill play  it mine but try and tell me how to fucking play and Ill take your rocket launcher and shove it where the sun dont shine  ,YogsRust,d46sfgh,7,t5_3ee30

Recruiting for a clan or a town?  Starting a community project?  Think someone is a fuck and everyone needs to know?  Have some clan political drama to share?
