I love every game but Id actually have to say that as far as gameplay and sheer fun factor goes Peace Walker beats every other game by a mile. The controls are just so perfect and being able to go back and replay older missions to get items or more recruits is the biggest and best design change they introduced in Peace Walker imo and i cant wait to see it return in some form in Ground Zeroes. The feel of progression the game gave me really sucked me in. Building up your own army researching and upgrading items and weapons tons of cool ones from other games in the series at high RampD building your own Metal Gear to fight as an optional side boss and being able to play as the soldiers you have recruited and trained who all have different stats and abilities that separate them from big Boss.

350408,0,t1_cfh19b7,gt Having that attitude just poisons a storytelling experience. You have to willing to go in giving them a chance to tell the tale.    But you also have to be willing to take that chance away.     I took an Analytical Writing class about a year ago and ya know what we did? Analyze poems and short stories discuss them then write about them. We didnt just immerse ourselves in the plot we tried to understand the motivations of characters the deeper meanings of the writings and any symbolism along with whatever evidence supported our writings. Fans can do that too. Heres an example of an analysis of MGS.     gt Kojima and the gangs writing is as big a part of Metal Gear as stealth is. The overthetop stories is what sets it apart from generic stealth games.    I want this stuff concluded. Actually conclude it too without adding  more games after you said you were done. Conclude it wait  or  years and consider a reboot. Sometimes the overthetop stories work sometimes theyre awful. The Senator in Rising? FUCKING AMAZING! To me that guy defined the game at the most crucial point of the story. Raiden in ? Pretty disappointing to be honest. I didnt care about him and the whole oneupping Franks loss of an arm in  with two arms missing instead of . It was brutal at first but later on ridiculous.    gt I think anyone who wants to skip Metal Gear Solid  just because its older is doing themselves a tragic disservice.   And a former English teacher I had would tell me I think anyone who hasnt read Shakespeare is  gt doing themselves a tragic disservice.    The fact is its going backwards. That stuff is old and dated why read that when I could watch a movie? MGS is actually my favorite. The NBC trooper as my flair is intentional because I love that game and those iconic enemies. That doesnt mean people have the time or want to invest it in order to just get a slightly better understanding of the game they just went through. Thats a good  hour investment for a newbie. Better just let a game stand on its on than prop it up with the past game so heavily. The Empire Strikes back is written well because it can stand on its own. Its not just a mirror image of the first movie pasted over a different setting but then turn out not to be at the same time nor does it all simultaneously turn out to be a cleverly orchestrated series of events played out via The Force. ,metalgearsolid,cfh35ro,-3,t5_2s4hr

Between the camo cqc and various weapons I felt like I had more options than ever to play the game my way and then come back and try it differently later which is rare for me.  It also had some of the coolest cinematic moments. I rank the ladder climb accompanied by Snake Eater to be one of the best Thats awesome moments in MGS.All in all MGS perfection.

Maybe thats a launching point for a discussion about some issue and the game wants to challenge your assumptions about Metal Gear games and the world at large.

If the game wants you to go left go right etc. Its sad that after the Left Behind DLC thats it for single player content. Still one more multiplayer content drop. Multiplayer is surprisingly fun if you havent tried it. Naughty Dogs second team are probably starting their new project now which is something to look forward to.Im currently playing South Park. Really enjoying that. I did just buy Dark Souls  as well. Dont think Ill get to it before Ground Zeros comes out though. I also want to play Ico HD.If you can let me know how you enjoy Thief. Im kinda on the fence. Ive heard the story is lack luster but gameplay is fun. The story is almost always my favorite part of games which is why I enjoy playing games like Heavy Rain or Beyond Two Souls. I wouldnt want all games to be like them but definitely enjoy those games occasionally.Resist those spoilers man. You will be happy you do. I got into Metal Gear really late around . Its now my favorite series and have played all the games multiple times but this is my first time waiting for a Metal Gear game to release. When I got into Metal Gear because of how known the franchise is some moments were spoiled. So its exciting for me this is my first time  Im experiencing a new Metal Gear along with the fans at the same time.I did buy MGS the day it released.

It is difficult to tell when I am pressed against cover until I try to leave it or back up. MGS always was great about how to handle walls and corners. What happened?

It could be in her rectum for all we know and both men and women have one of those.spoilerWhat Im saying is if Pazs character was male he would be tortured and abused in equally horrific ways because at the end of the day Skull Face wants to find the location of zerospoiler not be a vessel for Kojima to enact his supposed misogyny.,metalgearsolid,cgdfodr,3,t5_2s4hr

A good game designer can ensure that all roads lead to Rome which is important in making sure the player sees what they want him to see while still giving the freedom to do it their way. But having widerarea spaces to hide goodies and reward players will be beneficial.Camp Omega felt alive to me the first time I played through it. Sure the scripted patrol paths and vehicle paths feel stale and it was a little jarring to eavesdrop a conversation between two soldiers that only triggered because I was in earshot but for the most part that first time through everything felt living and natural.,metalgearsolid,cgvz032,1,t5_2s4hr

Regenerating health with no health bar to worry about Codec calls dont have to interrupt gameplay to avoid slow pacing and many other instances of streamlining. I fear that I sound like every other random troll complaining about how their favorite series Just aint what it used to be but MGS has been known for the tense slow and tactical gaming each game succeeded at until now. I could sit here and explain how specialized the game was like the gadget inventory in MGS and how each tool required battery life which was a real worrying factor on higher difficulties. I could remind you of the unique control scheme in the older games. And now I can remind you of the Binoculars in GZ which also function as a directional microphone enemy marker? and codex in some situations. And heres your iDroid a name that is so stupid its literally immersion breaking for me your impossibly futuristic communicatoreverything else even by MGS standards.

867983,0,t1_ch2sfi3,Im not saying that The Patriots could constantly supervise Solid Snakes actions to prevent him from defying them I only mentioned The Patriots influence once in my third least important point. I was saying that between MGS amp  Solid Snake did choose to defy his genetic lineage. In fact Solid Snake actually came close to becoming like Big Boss Liquid amp Solidus when he created Philanthropy. Just like the other Snakes Solid went rogue became the leader of a nongovernmental organization and travelled around the world seeking amp destroying Metal Gear clones. To some governments Snake and Philanthropy would be considered terrorist as Otacon and Snake were original meant to be executed at the end of MGS for their crimes. Of course we know that Snakes intentions were not to be like Big Boss but Big Boss didnt originally want to be what he became either.My main point was that Snake was designed to die in his middle age while Big Boss who ages normally was turning against Zero at the same age. The parallels are broken because Solid Snake would die before he could ever do the amount of damage with Philanthropy that the other Snakes tried to do with Outer Heaven the Sons of Big Boss and the Sons of Liberty. The fact that the Patriots were destroyed was actually not really due to Solid Snakes input. At that point he was actually once again a pawn of the Patriots because although Solid Snake defied his genetic lineage he could not defy Meme or Sense. The real hero of MGS was Ocelot who sacrificed himself to destroy the Patriots by distracting them with Liquids Insurrection. The Patriots tried to use Solid to stop Liquid but the real plan all along was for Naomi to contact Otacon and eventually Sunny so they could complete the FOXALIVE virus for uploading to GW.So lets say in a theoretical situation that Ocelot had never gone through with the hypnoLiquid plan and that Solid Snake was never genetically modified to die young. In that situation Solid Snake would continue to destroy Metal Gears with Philanthropy until they were all gone at which point he would turn his attention to The Patriots which he was already beginning to do in MGS.Big Boss also tried to step away from warmongering. MSF tried to be peaceful but it was because of Cipher amp XOF that he became the villain we know. Solid Snakes choice not to warmonger parallels Big Boss but if it werent for Ocelots final plan to destroy the Patriots and Solids predetermined death Philanthropy theoretically could have taken the same path as MSFDiamond DogsOuter Heaven. We can never know now but I dont see how that doesnt fit in.,metalgearsolid,ch2y0c3,2,t5_2s4hr

1201274,0,t3_27vh1p,gt   I can honestly say that Ground Zeroes left many of Metal Gear Solid V The Phantom Pains most unusual aspects off the table. Some mechanics from Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker are reintroduced in The Phantom Pain including the Mother Base system but theres also a wealth of brand new mechanics to discover.gt  The Phantom Pain is the most complex Metal Gear Solid game yet and I cant wait to dive into it headlonggt  At one point Ocelot hands Snake a canteen of water but he struggles to grasp it Snake is learning how to use his new prosthetic arm but clearly hasnt gotten the hang of it yet.gt  Ocelot remarks that Snake has three days to rescue Miller or else theyll lose their shot at revenge against those who destroyed Mother Base at the end of Ground Zeroes.gt  The producer clarified Your horse will defecate. Thats a feature.gt  return of the Fulton recovery system from Peace Walker ... Once there hostages are indoctrinated into the Diamond Dogs Snakes private military organization.gt  Sure enough I saw a goat a storage container and a military SUV hoisted into the air via balloon. Depending on the weather conditions and your surroundings theres the chance that the recovery wont go as planned. Youre given an indication of the success rate in the form of a percentage which is typically around  in good weather.gt  rather than call for a helicopter when you want to be evacuated to Mother Base you can take a seat in a vehicle or hop on top of a container and use the Fulton system for a quick escape. However if you try to do so in a sand storm theres a chance that youll be thrown off course and likely die as a result.gt  Rather than rapping his knuckles against a wall Snake spins his prosthetic hand at the wrist which emits sparks and a series of audible clicks and clacks.gt  Similarly when youre hiding in a dumpster you can pop out and wrench an enemy inside incapacitating him.gt  you can use the iDroid to keep track of different patrol patterns. Once youve got a good idea of where soldiers like to go you can set multiple markers and use them as waypoints to steer yourself clear of harms way.gt  Every players Mother Base is built to their own specifications and contains all of the people items and yes animals that were recovered from the field. At one point after roaming around his domain Mother Base came under attack but this was where the demo ended.gt  The bottom line is in The Phantom Pain Snake and Mother Base are intertwined and one cannot survive without the other.,metalgearsolid,ci4rfez,48,t5_2s4hr

1223589,0,t3_284a1v,Yeah Skull Face has bugged a lot of us since we first got a glimpse of him.So I came up with a bunch of dumbass theoriesBig Boss is in a coma after Zanzibar Theory Big Boss is in a coma and reliving memories of his life in flashbacks. Skull Face is Big Boss. Naked Snake is who the postcoma Big Boss wishes he was but Skull Face is who he really is. When he is awoken and rebuilt this causes his change of heart and is why he seeks out and reunites with Old Snake.Big Boss and the time machine theory Big Boss again after his defeat in Zanzibar manages to escape with his life barely intact. Hes grossly disfigured and has no memory of what happened. Zero by this time has successfully created a time machine. So he forces Big Boss I mean Skull Face to go back in time and fulfill the role that Naked Snake wouldnt fulfill at the end of Peace Walker. Lead his private army and do Zeros bidding. This obviously backfires because Skull Face still has latent memories of hating Zero and resents having to follow his orders.Skull Face doesnt exist theory Skull Face doesnt exist not in the real world hes completely in Big Bosss mind. Big Boss has multiple personalities disorder and he is Skull Face. Like Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Hes facing constant inner turmoil and his light side is literally and figuratively battling his dark side. I think we all know which side eventually wins.I had one or two more but Im really sleepy so maybe later.editlooks like he posted it here too ,metalgearsolid,ci79t2m,3,t5_2s4hr

The only reason people think its expensive is because of indies flooding the market for    as well as steam sales and mobile games.I remember when games used to cost between  and youd be lucky if you got  hours of enjoyment out of it. People who complain about GZ are people who buy first ask questions later. He mentions the  minute runtime which is unfair. On average people take between  and  hours to complete the main mission the first time on normal. But the way he states it is disingenuous because it makes it sound like itll be  mins tops. He should have said ...except you wont You only need about  minutes once youve had a few practice runsAlso he breaks the cardinal rule of reviews. He begins with the negatives. When reviewing something you need to start with the positives if there are any. This is because first impressions are important and if you start a review with a negative that will stick in the viewers mind. This review could take a prospective MGS fan and turn them off from buying it since the first thing he mentions is the Time Vs Length debate. Weve all been burned by a game at one point or another and that affects future purchasing habits.

Thats amazing. Were you one of the doctors in the hospital Big Boss ends up in? You were supposed to remove shrapnel but end up removing his arm instead! hahagtRoad Not TakenI have it downloaded and played the first bit. It was then that I remembered that I watched an indepth interview about it last year at E. So since thats fresh in my mind Im satiated on that game for now but Ill definitely be going back soon.gtSupernaturalI knew there was something on my list after The XFiles and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Once Im done on my anime binge Ill start. And while I dont really get most of Tumblr I know they arent all bad. Its normally just the vocal minorities and trolls that get noticed I have a friend who tumbles who facepalms regularly when I tell him about notorious things Ive seen then tells me those are just the weirdoes haha,metalgearsolid,cjrnqjr,5,t5_2s4hr

1688651,0,t3_2dqam2,All very great points especially the guards being oblivious to the sight of rifles on the floor. I like the option to hold up a soldier and lay him on the ground but something about him laying there permanently unless caught in alert phase kinda bugs me. I guess it feels so OP. Its kinda conflicting cause the player kinda deserves it getting the drop on the soldier but in a harder difficultly I want the soldier to try and escape after an elapsed time because they realize Im not there. Maybe Boss destroys their radio so even if the soldier gets up they cant immediately call HQIm sure there are better ideas to solve this. I think for normal mode its fine but in an extreme difficulty I want more variables and reasons to conclude that putting a bullet in his head is the only way to truly silence him not the ultimate triple hit combo KO. In GZ when a soldier is held up in the front if you drop your fire arm hell slowly drop his arms till he feels safe enough to attack you but if done from behind and out of sight he wont dare drop an inch. I think thats beautiful attention to detail which Kojima Pro is known for which we all love to see more of. TLDR  I want more sharp thinking soldiers in harder modes. ,metalgearsolid,cjs0ofm,13,t5_2s4hr
1689100,0,t3_2dpxf5,I would be thrilled with a series reboot. I dont know where the best place to start would be. One way would be to start at Snake Eater but I think itd be better off to start at MG and just tell the story of Solid Snake. Weve had enough Big Boss more than enough if we count PO.... Also only make a trilogy of MGMGMGS. I just cannot consider MGS and beyond canon because MGS was obviously something other than a straightforward extension of the story and MGS was just made to be made.

Through the idroid you can use an ingame walkman cassette player to play music youve collected or if youve got some music imported to your consoles system you can import  songs from there onto your in game idroid to listen to while you complete missions. There are preloaded songs from Peace Walker you can play on the idroid as well as some songs you can collect such as the two excellent songs Heres to You Joan Baez and the Zone of the Enders Beyond the Bounds Remix eshericks. Songs played on the idroid can be put on repeat so you dont have to keep playing them once they finish and while listening to anything you can leave the idroid and continue running about your mission with the music still playing.

1938466,0,t3_2gutl6,Well about the channel here it isFound something interesting in the last video Its between  seconds  There is a report made by someone Maybe a scientist.I typed it down so you could read itAlthough the forgotten Six had been rendered to a state which prevents them from dying they were far from being immortal. Their time was running out. Due to their accelerate aging their lifespan was shortly coming to an end. Their bodies were beginning to deteriorate. Machines can do just so much. My superiors did not allow this and ordered us to find a way to extend their lifespans. We were completely clueless on how we could accomplish this seemingly impossible goal. That is until we were joined by the female doctor Naomi Hunter.She had developed an incredible new type of technology which in theory could help us extend the lifespan of those creatures. First we need to perform some tests and find ourselves a human test subject. Finally we found a Romanian man who was willing to participate in our experiments. After injecting him with the experimental technology the results were extraordinary. Not only did the technology extend the lifespan of the subjects cells it made him virtually immortal!We had our solution but Dr. Hunter didnt stop there. She developed the technology even further using the Romanian man as a test subject. Didnt take long before she had developed another breathtaking function. The technology made the subjects cells repair themselves on an astounding speed making his wounds heal completely in a matter of seconds. We had succeeded in creating a method not just to keep The Forgotten Six alive but to make them virtually immortal.Regarding The Forgotten Six I think this video contains the answer about who they areI every video in the description there is some words I also typed them down just in caseCode talker the truth is lying dont believe the third line Heeds our warningYou are just part of their game of absolute endgame for complete control overThough Project Omega is still not making any sense to me gtlt,metalgearsolid,ckms0xh,20,t5_2s4hr

It almost seems like this person has never actually played a Metal Gear Solid game before but only kind of knows the story and the silly bits like cardboard boxes and the exaggerated fulton system. The story and characters have always been in the foreground which were deep dark and meaningful. Sure MGS is campy sometimes but its also tragic and magical at times. The ladder scene is a horrible example for a scene he cant take seriously it is right after a boss fight that likely took you  hours on your first try.

A trigger warning used to be a very reasonable thing until cynical assholes on the internet turned it into what it is now.A trigger a term from psychology is something that causes a flashback to a traumatic event you experienced. It can be an image sound whatever. Examples are war veterans. Seeing images from a warzone might set off flashbacks to their own traumatic experiences on the battlefield. Similarly showing rape in a movie might trigger flashbacks in rape victims. Some media thus included trigger warnings for common traumas.Now it has just become a term for cynical assholes to ridicule people who have concerns about anything and dismiss their arguments without actually making an argument of their own.,metalgearsolid,ckvgp8j,4,t5_2s4hr

There were so many  cutscenes and codec calls that I could recite from memory...I didnt have a PS for a long time so when MGS came out I couldnt play it. I had a friend who had never played MGS but owned MGS. He told me about how great it was and he showed me a few scenes on Big Shell. I wasnt impressed. It looked cartoony everything was orange and first person aim seemed like it was more action oriented.But the truth is I was just jealous and couldnt accept that I cannot play this game at home...When I got my first job at the age of  I bought my first very own computer a Sony Vaio. Before that I only had a pretty crappy Pentium  that I shared with my siblings. A year later I just realized WHOA! They released MGS for PC?! I must try it!So I played MGSSubstance on PC and LOVED it.When MGS was released I was in the same pickle again. I had no PS and no intention to buy one so I couldnt play it. I just tried to ignore all the hype and talk about it. I saw a few screens of someone shooting a rifle in a jungle and something with burning trees probably the The Sorrow boss fight and again told myself Looks like they made it an action game and its not even Solid Snake. Looks like Im not missing much.Then around  my brother bought me a used PS as a present with lots of hacked games on the HDD. I immediately got MGS and fell in love with it again! I even bought the Subsistance rerelease when it came out and watched the MGSExistence movie which is a masterpiece with a cool twist btw.That was the point I became a REAL MGS fanatic.

2109571,0,t3_2j07qm,It isnt.Before I got the game I bashed it based off of basically everything I was right about.Incredibly horrible premise and characters. Seriously? Child brains and cheesy lines with a token Black guy? Stereotypical anime white girl as the helmswoman and an offensive caricature of Russians?Shit combat. Like seriously I dont try to describe things as shit because its just lazy but so is the combat. There feels like there is no weight at all to the swords almost like swinging around a  foot long x of balsa wood at enemies made of toilet paper thin aluminum foil. I have played my share of Platinum games Ninja Gaidens and God of Wars but this is just abysmal. I seriously dont understand how it came out so horrible.Music is the only thing that stays on par with this game because it matches the shit combat just right. So I guess thats a plus. I personally didnt like the music but it fit so well it just seems like it has to be positive.Graphics and Art Direction was atroicious. It was like I was playing a low budget Platinum game with Metal Gear paraphernalia in it. I swear its like they didnt even try to ground this game in the Metal Gear universe and it irked me to no end. Truly a trying time trying to finish this just so I wouldnt have to look at it again.This is one of  games that made me completely lose trust for a product that a company has put out. Kojima should be ashamed.But hey at least its not confirmed canon and a spinoff so dont play it if you dont want to. Nothing in it is necessary in literally any way toward the Universe. ,metalgearsolid,cl7yzse,1,t5_2s4hr

2260940,0,t1_clr5xs5,Im going to argue theres no way to objectively argue whether anything in a game or art piece is ever good or bad. True objectivity is silence. What you want is impartiality and to be unbiased. Ive never understood the whole Our choices dont matter! thing. RPGs have choice by definition but stories have to be told and just because the final cutscene is only a colorswap doesnt mean each of the three  endings dont have extremely different implications. Other minor things  are people misunderstanding the lore. Some people who are the most vocal have only played the trilogy once. Or only played ME itself once and havent picked it up since launch other than to load their save and play the EC ending meaning they replayed just the final mission. Stories have to have an ending and we got four. They each have very different implications. Do people want whether or not Wrex shot Fist in the face to have some sort of impact on the last  minutes of ME? Theres not much to factor in. I had my mind blown when I read a Codex in Mass Effect  that made me think Holy shit! That sounds exactly like the starchild at the end! Holy shit they were toying with the idea the whole time! I want to find that entry again.I was never bothered by the endings but the people that go delusionalobsessive OMG they were indoctrinating the player through the whole game!!! I can hardly tolerate.

The context of the greater political struggle as we understand it now builds on that naturally but I dont think we need to reach for things that just arent there.Spoilers lay ahead. Cant tag from phoneThe greater theme of MGS was that genetic legacy. When MGS came out big boss was still framed as basically the villain and liquid carried the heavy mantle of his fathers legacy. At the same time snake is being yanked along as a patriot puppet. The wording there is especially important.

Youre speaking to what the dedicated hardcore fans liked or would want  where the entire reason they gave this to an LA team was because MGO didnt have a large enough audience. Their thinking is going to be lets make it more like other successful FPS multiplayer games to see more success this time. What you need to be convincing them of is the fact that thinking in this way will only serve to make their game unexceptional  where they have the opportunity to make something as lasting and memorable as MGO was but in a way that will have broader appeal.

Angles formed by two rays lie in a plane but this plane does not have to be a Euclidean plane Angles are also formed by the intersection of two planes in Euclidean and other spaces These are called dihedral angles Angles formed by the intersection of two curves in a plane are defined as the angle determined by the tangent rays at the point of intersection.

You cant get above  inside unless you have Splitter from a previous playthrough even wearing red Squares and pressing against red brick.It hits you hard and fast in the Virtuous mission. It can be extremely difficult to see the guards positions and stay out of their sightlines especially if you dont think to swap back to the old topdown camera and its easy to blindly run into a guy.It took me years to realize that the best strategy for Virtuous is to go to the right around the back and drop down from the roof.I love throwing a snake into Sokolovs room on the way. ,metalgearsolid,co5suld,3,t5_2s4hr

2992483,0,t1_co84y1w,Im using Unity have been for the past ish years. I had previous experience with coding in Visual Basic so I wasnt too overwhelmed with the coding as I would have been otherwise. Unity has blown up lately so there is an insane amount of resources out there to get you started but its a lot different than those things you mentioned. Youll have to learn C and modeling as it doesnt have a level creator or anything like that and it doesnt have any kind of visual programming like RPG Maker or Game Maker does.Luckily C is not too difficult and tools like SketchUp make building levels easy as well. For coding Unitys own tutorials cover a variety of topics and skill levels ,metalgearsolid,co8633c,3,t5_2s4hr

It is probably the most important game in Big Boss story and it is baffling that it was a mobile game first.Portable Ops isnt canon and from the descriptions Ive read of it it also isnt very good. Although I hear it does introduce characters like Campbell so it might be worth at least reading a story synopsis or watching a Lets Play.,metalgearsolid,colwwxm,10,t5_2s4hr

But be careful MGS was made on DirectX  and sine things like shadows and screens dont work so emulating it out probably a better more stable option since MGS PC is a straight port with no real improvements.MGS can be had for about  on eBay I recommend the Microsoft action pack because it comes with two other games. It requires a bit of fixing to get working but once it runs it does so pretty well only issue being the stealth camo effect which can be turned off anyway. This one is worthwhile because it is not a straight port the textures are way better and it looks far far far better than even the emulated PS version and includes cool features like a first person mode. This version has never left PC so PC is the only way to play it.To get them running you will have to use the pc gaming wiki which explains how to apply all the fixes.,metalgearsolid,coypjbz,6,t5_2s4hr

3397672,0,t1_cpfjutm,gt First of all its quite insulting that you spent the entirety of your argument talking down to your audience and explaining things to them in metaphors like theyre children.Im sorry if it came out that way but I wrote this after having to argue the same point over and over and having the same pseudoarguments throw back at me reframing the issue trying to cancel out the bad with the good and just being unable to see the sexism that is there. So its more about arguing that it exists and is there and people dont see to be able to see it and try and point it out again and again just to go back to reframing and denying.gt Youve only managed to explain the idea of sexism and blame the audience for it.Well theres a k char limit.  I didnt intend on blaming anyone for it because I dont think its even there intentionally. Just a product of the prejudices of us all.gt If you perform certain actions you can see Meryl in her underwear in both scenes.Yes but why is it there? I didnt even know you could do that but why does the game reward the player for being creepy?gt The nudity here is not sexist. However the idea that Meryls hypersexualized walk making her butt wiggle and having the men cheekily comment on it IS sexist.Yes exactly my point! Its not the nudity or clothing is the context and portrayal!gt See the difference? Nudity doesnt necessarily imply sexI dont think I ever implied it does. If I did give that impression my bad.gt In Metal Gear Solid  you are introduced to posters of scantily clad women and the sexy magazines. Also Snake Beater trophy. Ill say that I find the whole distract soliders with playboys demeaning. Sure its there to be funny but I think it portrays men badly. As so sexcrazed that we cant even patrol a corridor or see an enemy approaching if theres a woman in bikinis nearby.gt Maybe Kojima wanted to make the audience feel uncomfortable seeing these burly men fawn over a little girl and showing them that at humans are capable of evil?Maybe in a different game. Sadly thats not MGS. Not only can you date her weird on its own but hey Japan? but you can grope her.gt Its implied that Kojima intended to make the audience feel guilty for taking pleasure in having sexual fantasies of these war and sexual abuse victims. The idea that Kojima wants to remind the player of their misdeeds reoccurs throughout the game several times from the sexualization of these women to the killing of enemies.This might have been his intention but was so poorly executed that it never clicked.gt Well have to wait and see what Quiet is all about. I dont doubt his ability to create yet another fantastic character. Does it change the fact that she was desigend to induce more people into cosplaying and titilating male players? No. Does it deny the issues the series has with women? No.gtOverall I feel that Kojimas Metal Gear games have been intentionally progressiveAbsolutely.

I just like the idea of drawing up something new instead of just copying something that exists. I also recall Kojima saying on twitter recently before all the recent shit happened that the gun customization is deeper thanks to Shinkawa and that goes back on my other point as a possibility of internalnew design being able to make certain customizations thus making it deeper but who knows.But those are just my thoughts and opinions.

So whenever they looked at him they gave him the evil eye because all they could see was the man who had killed the albatross. Making him linked with the bird for the rest of the voyage.,metalgearsolid,cqquni8,1,t5_2s4hr
3812658,0,t3_343e1x,Two ruses in  years. Thats all Im saying.Most everyone knew Metal Gear had to end eventually and Im glad that Kojima isnt chained to it anymorebut I didnt want it to end like this.People say This can only be a good thing! Dont you see Kojima can work on what he wants to now! and I get that. But surly its not good that it came when it did that way it did? Months before the release of MGSV and the team is hard at work trying to finish it but now they have the added pressure of all this. Its not just about what will happen to Kojima but all the people that worked with him to create games we love. Just the other day I saw a twitter post from a team member at KP LA who said it would be their last day in the wake of all of this Konami stuff. Fortunately I believe they said they got a job to work at Infinity Ward. Not sure if that makes sense I got kind of emotional thinking about it.  ,metalgearsolid,cqqvgq5,2,t5_2s4hr

And yeah Anita gives us a really fucking bad name. She claims that corpse despawning in video games is sexist. When she was talking about WatchDogs she was talking about how women are attacked killed and then when the game is done with them it throws them away in a point about fucking despawning. Shes a doofus. Not to mention her fucking nonsensical expectations for a female character. I fucking despise The Amazing Atheist but one video where I agree with him wholeheartedly is her video on good female characters. She claims that feminine females are too weak and therefore sexist she claims badass females are too strong and are just men with boobs and therefore sexist and her ideal female character isnt even a character but instead is a pair of pants. I suggest you watch TAAs video called Anita Sarkeesian Sucks at being a feminist or something like that. I dont remember its exact title.

4241232,0,t1_cs3o3qs,I remember seeing a video showing a Big Boss as the attacker and as a defender. I guess it could work and it makes sense for you as a player to see another player customised. However I do find it strange that this is the second journalist talking about the same thing so I started to consider this possibility to have that as SP we didnt know about micro transactions either so there might be more topics that are under the embargo.I hope this is the case and it is MGO only but I feel this is a leak to prepare us for it maybe the trailer next week will reveal it. At least this is the first time I can have a theory to explain the horns and Skull Face. It could work all the way until MGS for example why Solid Snake never realized that BB is his father but doesnt explain how BB shows up at the end of MGS looking like Big Boss. Maybe he changes back at some point? Thats the reason why I think my own theory has flaws but I dont have that info to try to fill the gaps.,metalgearsolid,cs3oxy8,1,t5_2s4hr

Vehicles are also tagged as a Diamond Dogs logo. In addition to the GMP cost Big Boss only seems to have a limited number of Fultons rather than the infinite number he had during gameplay last year correct me if Im wrong. Attaching a Fulton also takes a little longer although this could be due to not having upgraded it enough. Starting a new mission from in the open world seems to replenish them. In addition to Spit it out we also have a Where are the rest? option when interrogating an enemy.  Enemies may not be able to spot Big Boss using the Phantom Cigar a jeep drove past him and didnt notice. This could however be because he was off the road at an awkward angle. DDs happiness running alongside Big Boss is just the cutest thing. His whine as you swap him out is the saddest thing  Big Boss is referred to as Punished Venom Snake in the opening mission credits. Kojima pls Night Vision uses power now energy bars under the item icon although rank  means no power consumed.

4424512,0,t1_cso9wkz,The reason was because of refunds to many people were going to use it and it would make everyone look like a fool. The argument should have never been with the game but with Nvidia and Amd for their shit drivers especially nvidia lately. These games are branded with nvidia game works yet you cant even use them unless you have a ti or Titan. Total biscuit also made a fit because there was no review copy which started backlash to begin with. Where is all the news about it now? There hasnt been an update or driver fox and it still runs fine.Edit Im not backing the support for broken games or WB MKX is still as disaster I believe. But when people freak out on a large scale over some minor hiccups that is ridiculous. This game is a gameplay and story masterpiece really immersion and just a fantastic game. To me that outshines any issues it has which they are very minor anyway. The Witcher  has more problems than this and yet people are saying its the greatest game ever. I crash every  minutes and yet somehow I have like  hours of gameplay. A good game is still that AC games suck and then they also have problems. ,metalgearsolid,csoeieu,1,t5_2s4hr

Thats not what I meant by my comment.  we know Raiden went through a lot of solid style simulations.  big shell was supposed to be a recreation of shadow moses if I remember correctly.  He was meant to become the next Solid Snake a manufactured version.  why wouldnt the patriot try to recreate Big Boss in Gray Fox?  I mean he was the boss right hand man and highest lieutenant.  Yet the only right hand buds we see are Quiet Kaz and Ocelot so far.  Why no Frank Jaeger?

I ate that shit up.About a year later I got an Xbox and after revisting Twin Snakes I figured it was time to play Sons of Liberty which thankfully was out on Xbox as Substance. I ate THAT shit up.Then the dark years...i.e. never getting around to snagging a PS until my buddy offered to sell me it. That day I went straight to Gamestop and grabbed me some MGS Subsistence. That shit rocked my dick. I spent months playing that game. It was the perfect MGS.My brother had a PS so when he wasnt using it I would plow through MGS. But when Peace Walker came out? Yeah didnt own a PSP...so I waited.... Thank the lord for the HD Collection on Xbox so I could have total undivided attention to it.Ground Zeroes came out and there was a big hubbabloo over the pricecontent. Well I kept myself busy building a PC and snagged it for  bucks via the recent Steam sale. THAT GAME IS ROCKING MY WORLD. I dont see what the fuss was about. I got a nice deal!And now I wait for TTP and this time...Im going Day  on that shit! Well two weeks after consoles. Oh well.

4603610,0,t1_ctasl4f,You dont need to go left but there is a prisoner hiding out over there in a shack near the guard tower. If I dont extract him via helicopter from the start point I usually just creep around the south perimeter neutralizing guards until Im at the eastern prison compound extract all of those prisoners carry them over to the cliff cave one by one and them put them all on the chopper at the same time and then I head up the road into the admin compound. You just have to move carefully stay low and neutralize everyone you come near. Its hard but you can get Paz out without being spotted but you have to think ahead and give yourself a path to either the cliff cave or the entry point at the south cliff. In fact if you just leave that first prisoner on the southern cliff forty minutes in the pouring rain will seem like nothing once hes safe inside Mother Base dead in a helicopter crash you can get Paz back there by sneaking down the west side of the camp and get them both out at the same time minimizing alerts since the guards will spot Morpho leaving that extraction point since he always flies east over the camp once hes picked up his target. Idiot pilot.  So thats one basic path the hard part is clearing everyone out as you move along.,metalgearsolid,ctavebz,3,t5_2s4hr

4640352,0,t1_ctesjd4,I am pretty certain MGSV will deal with The Patriots being born probably from the AI developed in PW.Though I find it hard to use knowledge from MGS and MGS as serious canon because that whole scene was for the metanarrative in a way The Patriot AIs is the game itself and MGSs entire story is the endless repeating of cycles the tropes being forced onto people again and again.Which is why when FOXALIVE kills it we get the franchise rebooted through the MGS Ocelot battles until all is fixed and we are released from the cycle. The endings play st MGSs ending has Meryl accept Campbell as family and live as the ending of  wanted. nd MGS ends with Raiden accepting his role in his family and this time he gets to pass on his teachings to his son as the ending of  wanted. rd Solid visits Big Bosses gr wait. Hes just reenacting MGSs ending. Hes trapped in the cycle.Which is why Big Boss moves in shoves him aside salutes The Boss and dies so Snake is free.So in terms of MGS they sent you to kill me again is just the plot of the game is forcing this to happen for a third time. It is inescapable and inevitable.Also MGSs ending is why I never want to see him in the timeline past that scene.

4670217,0,t3_3ex65m,Here I might have a little more help in lieu of some of the answers. I recently went through Metal Gear   wrapping Solid  tonight and starting MGS. Ive been assigning a week to each game and will continue to do so until TPP drops and gave MG amp MGSS a week together obvs Ive been at it two weeks already. The numbers as follow are based on personal experience anecdotes from others and a variety of other sources reviews at the time friends cutscenes etc taken into account. They assume you perform merely average sightsee codecs exploration experimentation gameovers etc.  Metal Gear    hours Metal Gear  Solid Snake   hours Metal Gear Solid  hours Metal Gear Solid  Sons of Liberty   hours Metal Gear Solid  Snake Eater   hours Metal Gear Solid  Guns of the Patriots   hours Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker   hours Metal Gear Solid V Ground Zeroes   hours to A couple notes on thisIve left very generous estimates based on my original baseplays so yours might be significantly shorter. The reason for this is that you asked if you can beat these games before TPP ships so Ive alloted more time than you should need rather than less so in case Im wrong youve got room to spare and not less. Peace Walker is the biggest wildcard here because it really depends how much extraops stuff you wanna do. I would advise doing enough to progress the story but keep your OG save around in case time gets short and you cant get some of the Zadornov missions to pop when you want them to.Ground Zeroes  is a little dicey too because it really depends how quick your learning curve is. Some missions are a breeze to Srank even on Hard once you know what youre doing. Others like Jamais Vu can be a pain in the ass because they require a specific type of play during one of their sections. Portable Ops is canon in an abstract way IE the key events are important soandso is revealed as a member of The Patriots for example but on the whole its a very hohum experience half the time with a lot of its gameplay veering into tedium way more than any other of canon. Id suggest checking out the cutscenes on YouTube over dinner sometime a full play is definitely not required.Overall the goal here is as always to have fun. Id say honestly you can trump most of the games in a couple maybe three nights or a full weekend. Dont listen to the cats telling you to race through em in a few hours if you were just in it to beat em then who cares whenhow. Pop em in stroll around a bit really experience them. You wont regret it!,metalgearsolid,ctj8ek5,6,t5_2s4hr

The Boss wanted him to know the truth However he couldnt tell anyone the truth about The Boss after MGS and during Peace Walker without risking nuclear war. That is why you see him acting like he  doesnt know what really happened. He does not hate The Boss.Edit Further proof He still goes by  Snake or Naked Snake at the beginning of Peace Walker and not Big Boss because he still has respect for the boss. He gets mad when people call him Big Boss until the end of the game.

However in reality using both knife and gun in such a way is ineffective and downright silly and hazardous to the user. This derpyness lasted until MGS surprisingly.Fortunately enough in MGS the designers stuck to a CQC technique thats similar to real life CQC implementing Judoesquemixedmartial art styles that are not only more effective but make more sense tactically speaking.Sources,metalgearsolid,cu5nsxc,19,t5_2s4hr

4865108,0,t1_cu7qs1b,I just dont think there needs to be a nonlethal kill since imo playing nonlethal is meant to be the more challenging and therefore more rewarding playstyle and not having an easy way to permanently incapacitate enemies is just one of the trade offs you have to make. If they really wanted to add a nonlethal way to permanently incapacitate enemies Id have preferred something like cable tying an enemies hands and feet behind their back and stuffing something in their mouth but they struggle and try to make noise so anyone who passes within a certain distance would automatically go and check on them or something just so theres more of trade off... I actually only found out about holding up enemies on the ground in GZ about a week ago and only started playing Peace Walker a couple of days ago but since I found out about it Ive just found them way too easy and way less rewarding.I respect your opinion but I respectfully disagree nonlethal was plenty viable before and imho holding up enemies on the ground is definitely an OP technique.,metalgearsolid,cu7s8rl,1,t5_2s4hr

A large amount of my recommended videos are likely to be influenced by the fact that my recent history has been revisiting the plot lines in the previous games since my BC PS has a busted bluray drive. Guess its time to delete my YouTube search and view history in a vain attempt to not have the storyline spoiled to shit. I really miss the days when game leaks or promotional stunts badly designed as leaks were less common and less publicized. Treating such widely used sites like YouTube Reddit v and even social networking as minefields so I can fully enjoy a game unspoiled is insane. Greg should be able to play the game if hes got it.

That is officially when the game launches and when Steam will update as such.But he also says if you prepurchase you can download and play before then. At the earliest September st in the New Zealand timezone. I suspect he means midnight NZST and that translates to  AM PST on August st. That would mean you can preload then. He did say earlier that there wouldnt be a preload but in that case what else could he be talking about here?

4926062,0,t1_cueowwu,theres two seperate things you can get from GZ any special pow  hostage and the sniper team that you extract in completed missions of GZ will be in your mother base come TPP.  first run editions of GZ hard copys had a voucher in the disc box for additional staff. these are not tied to the people you extract in your GZ save file and we are not really sure who or how many people this will grant. Your chance of getting this now is slim to none and you need the voucher not the disc. In order to get either of these bonuses you need to play both GZ and TPP on the same system so the system can read your save file and the vouchers are console specific as well. Hope this helpsEdit technically the third thing you get from GZ save file is the sneaking suit. You will need a GZ save file on the same system PS or Xbox can not transfer between the two to get the sneaking suit in TPP,metalgearsolid,cufgw2e,1,t5_2s4hr

They basically pulled Skull Face out of their hat and made him the ultimate absolute evil to bail Zero out from the role of a villain. MEEEH. There are obviously more reasons why the story of TPP really fell flat on its face that would take way too long to explain.

He wanted to express characters through more than just dialogue and i think it somewhat works here. Sure Big Boss doesnt talk as much but hes a different person than what he used to be...gtvery little ambient musicIts there though and sometimes no music is good for those wanting to hear everything in their surroundings.gtnext to zero heart stopping intense adrenaline fuelling MGS momentsTheyre there and so are playercontrolled moments of fun. Its probably better this way.gtand dont even get me started on the intro credits on every missionI like it. It lets one know whats coming up and if they should be prepared. Of course you dont actually have to read the writing which comes up. You could just watch the footage instead. gt I know its supposed to play like a TV series as opposed to a movie but I cant help but feel like this is just a way for Hideo Kojima to boost his ego even further. No idea where you got this from. I think the TV style works better for an openworld game trying to implement a complex story. It makes sense to break the story down into separate missions or episodes rather than using prior narrative styles which just wouldnt work.The thing is people are disappointed because they fell for the hype. It got even bigger when everyone found out it would be Kojimas last MGS game. Kojima delivered a great product.

5037639,0,t3_3jx7p2,Share many similar feelings as OP along with additional thoughts. Spoilers below.Bosses Skulls unit was not very interesting nor challenging. Most MGS games have a heavy focus on the villains and seeing their side of history. MGS and MGS did this fantastically. MGS had the boss and portrayed her complexity perfectly. Cobra unit as individuals didnt have the same complexity as the MGS bosses but they were very memorable in their personalities. MGS Beauties were more subtle but still there to explore the lore if one was inclined.  TPP...Skulls and Skullface were underwhelming as OP described perfectly. spoilerVenom Snake Find it really hard to believe that a medic soldier from the ranks could be mentally trained and hypnotized to be an equal of Big Boss as a soldier. This seems to prioritize memes over genes which seems to go against later MGS games where Big Bosses genes were prized for their fighting acumen in the genome army and etc. spoilerBoss battles The Quiet boss battle was pretty good but everything else was boring. The final metal gear boss battle was too easy. spoilerChapter...? I was a little disappointed with the game length as I finished Chapter  relatively fast. I had no idea there was a chapter  and was left feeling very unsatisfied as the game portrayed the end of chapter  as the end of the game. Of course...all of a sudden End of Chapter One pops up and chapter  begins...leaving me all awwww dayum...DIS GONNA BE GOO! But then Im left repeating missions I had already done in chapter ? This was a huge break in immersion and really...whats the point? Chapter  just seemed so short and incomplete in comparison to chapter . spoiler Uninspiring open world. Afghanistan and Africa just seemed to be made up of outposts in different shapes and forms. Would have been interesting to have villages to exploresee the effects of war on the general population. spoilerWith all that said tho...the gameplay was phenomenal overall.

5043849,0,t1_cutyfb9,Precisely this. Everything about this. Metal Gear Solid has always been about Kojimas vision his wacky sense of humour quirky little easter eggs and at its core a wonderful and well written story about patriotism terrorism what it means to be a soldier discerning right from wrong and at the end getting to stop the bad guys one way or another.And what I love most about the character Big Boss is that he is a hero. A true hero to me and many others who is violently awakened finally to what his mentor was trying to tell him that true soldiers have no place in the world of politics and shifting borders  that to unite the world would give people like him a true home a place to be forever  on the battlefield where he belongs.He is a good man that suffered cruel and unusual torment as part of his job and to me that will always be what transformed him from the allAmerican action hero of MGS to the jaded and somewhat unstable pseudoterrorist of Peace Walker and onwards. I dont know about you but I grew up with Snake Solid Liquid and Big Boss all three hell even Solidus as a little kid. My first foray into the world of MGS was the first Playstation title Metal Gear Solid. Id never experienced anything like it it was  and I was hooked completely on the story. The gameplay while fun was nothing incredible to write home about for me it was always a means to an end to hear the rest of the story and since then Metal Gear has always been about the story for me. And as a lifelong fan of the series the same guy who teared up at the prospect of Solid Snake dying prematurely of old age in MGS who teared up at the end of MGS when it was revealed that this poor guy was put through the ringer essentially for money for the government made to kill the only woman he ever cared about for a paycheque...I feel left out.I feel as if story was sacrificed for gameplay. And while the gameplay is topdrawer...its not Metal Gear Solid without an enthralling plot...and I hate to say it but MGSV has a very very weak and poorly written plot. And it pains me to say that.Hideo Kojima is capable of overseeing some of the best storytelling I have ever experienced in video game history. He is an absolute master in his field.

5047873,0,t1_cuu00vf,What can I say  I agree. Other than the portable games MGS should have never gone mission based or more so open world if you can call it that. MGS is a was story driven linear experience MGS V let the side down and borrowed to heavily from Peace Walker and Portable OPs. All of the base building recruitment and open world content was a distraction from the lack of story and cut scenes. It was over ambitious arguably not what the fans even wanted and ultimately became the downfall of this game. People complained about the amount of cut scenes in previous MGS titles are we all fine with how much time we watch VS board sit in and leap down from the chopper? This sequence of events alone holds more screen time than the actual story. Dont even get me started when it comes to the boring get from A to B while dodging camps and check points.Personally I would have prefered story developing cut scenes over that repetitive crap any day.,metalgearsolid,cuugkb7,2,t5_2s4hr

My understanding was that he was going to destroy the English language and all its speakers because Zero had designed Ciphers control of global events through the use of English as a common language seeing as how its one of the most prevalent languages worldwide. His idea was to break Ciphers control of global politics by undoing the basis for its method of Where it totally loses me is how this is supposed to lead to a world where everyone and their mum buys nukes from Skullface to create global peace through nuclear deterrence to the level where everyone gets a nuke. Ironically he neednt have bothered because as Otacon says in MGS  Every dot com has its own Metal Gear. I think in the end Skull Face had two separate plans that he ranted about at the same time and confused people by thinking they were linked. Plan  Destroy the English language to stop Cipher controlling everything with the systems they currently have in placePlan  Copy Coldmans plan from Peacewalker and show off the new Metal Gear to the world to start a new nuclear arms race where everyone buys nukes from Skull Face for...reasonsIt makes sense in a way.

I think the significance of the Operation Intrude N tape is that Venom was in on the plan in some capacity and had some desire to work with the real Big Boss. Its hard to say if Solid Snake killing Venom in MG is a set up orchestrated by Big Boss to kill off Venom once he had no use for him or if Venom had become a liability or if Venom was actually supposed to take down Solid but Venom agreed to work for Big Boss which is how he got in on the Outer Heaven Uprising this is confirmed by the cut tape of a conversation between Big Boss and Venom Snake. ,metalgearsolid,cuw2m3i,7,t5_2s4hr

5061704,0,t1_cuw19g5,it was actually quite fun figuring it out. Once I understood that it had to be language that was spreading it because why else would they show us what language our soldiers speak although at the time I was acting on a gut feeling that this had to be the reason why they showed us their languages and why the tip in the menu screen tells us that soldiers in the same unit can learn each others languages it just took a few steps to realise what it was. It couldnt have been any language that I had encountered in Afghanistan because there was no trace of the disease in Afghanistan at the time so that ruled out RussianPashto and a whole load of other languages. Obviously it couldnt be English because we are lead to believe that there was no English being shoved down the throats of people. Then it was a case of seeing what African languages the inital symptomatic soldiers had in common and the only languages that all  or so had in common were English Pashto Russian and Kikongo.

5064357,0,t3_3kbjuq,I dont know if this is all a part of Kojimas plan or not. But this is fun and Im jumping on the hype train. So I clicked on and heres what struck me. X is the roman numeral for . The first line of text is gibberish. But it has  letters. Now I might be looking into this too much but Kojima has made it clear that the V in phantom pain is intentional. So if that roman numeral is intented for  then perhaps the X is for . Now if you put that together that comes up as  Decode INGSOC. I looked up the List of Newspeak words on wikipedia and clicked on the th point... Unperson. Im straight copying and pasting from Wikipedia here. gt An unperson is a person who has been vaporized who has not only been killed by the state but effectively erased from existence. Such a person would be written out of existing books photographs and articles and the original copies destroyed so that no trace of their existence could be found in the historical record. The idea is that such a person would according to the principles of doublethink be forgotten completely for it would be impossible to provide evidence of their existence even by close friends and family members. Mentioning his or her name or even speaking of their past existence is thoughtcrime the concept that the person may have existed at one time and has disappeared cannot be expressed in Newspeak. Compare to the Stalinist practice of erasing people from photographs after their execution see photos right.Guys I dont know what to believe. Im looking into this too much. But oh man. If this is somehow true this would fit in with Big Boss Phantom Venom. Hes never mentioned in any of the games before. This is the only time hes been mentioned. Venom is and Unperson. Whoa. But take this with a pinch of salt. This may just be complete DHorse shit. Most likely it is and whoever is making this hoax is laughing all the way. EDIT I also noticed letters in the bottom right of the image posted in my comment above. Put into photoshop to look at it closely and the letters are K pi symbol or A RS NB CQL Y.Q.H.R.S. K?RS NB CQL Y.Q.H.R.S. Heres the Image!EDIT  Welp looks like my text box prediction was off. Apparently the first line of text can be deciphered as Red Herring and the bottom right as STAND BY FOX H.O.U.N.D. I dont know how that was solved but if someone can explain that would be great. ,metalgearsolid,cuwg3o0,14,t5_2s4hr

5064549,0,t3_3kaxf0,Im just going to pretend the mission  ending is the real ending because its obviously what Kojima intended. The current ending isnt satisfying in the sense that it leaves some loose ends with my biggest complaint being Eli.  Eli hating Big Boss just for his genes seems pretty shallow but when you add in that the man he perceived to be Big Boss shot accidentally shot him solidifies why. That said Im pleased with how Kojima handled Big Boss and his ending. Big Boss never wanted to become a figurehead messiah for Zerolegendary soldier he just wanted to live in a world where soldiers were respected and always had a place in society. Once he made himself a target and shit hit the fan he was so scared of dying he had to use his comrade as a body double to do his dirty work and build the legend that Big Boss was too scared to do himself. With time Big Boss had become the military equivalent to the politicians and bureaucrats he stood against who were always so willing to send soldiers to their death without a second thought just to serve their personal agenda. ,metalgearsolid,cuwgxoc,2,t5_2s4hr

Did it even end there? Nope I couldnt drive the car because snake just slided off it when I tried. So I had to try fultoning it  which miraculously dropped the prisoner outside of the hole just at the edge with the car on top. Luckily he survived.Then I had to grab this motherfucker and get out of there but by now the whole base was after me.

5080460,0,t1_cuydxrt,Welcome and thank you for your interest in Black Hound!Chosen? Youll be contacted shortly at the email you provided with details on your future involvement in the development of Black Hounds world.What is Black Hound?Black Hound is a survival horror game inspired mostly by other games in the genre such as Silent Hill Resident EvilAlone in the Dark and most recently P.T. The aborted Silent Hills game.Whats the story?The worlds coming to an end. Your small city is one of the last remaining pockets of uninfected humanity on the planet.The walls around it were constructed by a goverment refief agency to keep whatever caused this outbut the only purpose they seem to serve now is keeping everyone in and driving them mad.Those that do pass the walls never come back.The Father a single parent and double amputee has been protecting and raisingThe Child for months in this walledoff city. Dealing with the loss of his wife and The Childs sibling six years ago had beendifficult enough without the neighbors going feral and seemingly supernatural creatures roaming the streets.Last night he failed. She was taken from him.The story will follow The Father as he attempts to find The Child leave the city and return to where The Child was bornand where her mother died. The player will control both of these characters over the course of the main story line.The two main characters are known for now as The Father and The Child.Their names are one of the aspects of the world that the Chosen will have control over.The main playable portion of the game will take place in the year in a very small city of  somewhere in the northwest United States.How does it play?Thirdperson control system. Very similar to recent titles like Uncharted  Tomb Raider Metal Gear Solid V.However some portions of the game are a firstperson experience such as when controlling The Child.The Fathers combat mechanics will be melee oriented but he may be able weild certain firearms in rare cases.The Childs gameplay sections will not be combat sections in the traditional sense.More info on The Childs abilities will be made available when other aspects of the game are decided by the Chosen.Alright how much do you want?Nothing at all. In fact when the game releases Projected Q  it will be absolutely free on the PC.There will never be a kickstarter youll never get an email asking for funding and youll never seea Donate Here! button on the main page. There is no catch.This is a labor of love for us and NOT our job which is why developmenton this title may seem slower than what youre used to.Were perfectionists. Well most of us are.We aim to produce a beautiful and terrifying world for you all to enjoy.Were not interested in pushing something out just because its playable. We want your enjoymentand praise to be our payment and we cant get that if we produce anything less than awesome.Are you Kojima?We are not Kojima.Is this a hoax?This isnt a hoax.,metalgearsolid,cuydz58,1,t5_2s4hr

5081221,1,t1_cuydlqp,I really  need to see more than this to justify it being that bad. Its lighter yes. Kojima breaks a lot of old MGS traditions. But so far Ive seen about  well thought out posts on some great interpretations on how it ended whereas the only negative bits all have the same thing rushed cheap or etc.I mean this story is light and self contained. Its a story of vengeance. Just because its not as saturated with exposition and lengthy cutscenes doesnt make it any lesser of a story. There are some things which got lost along the way unfortunately as is with long production times but I have no idea what people mean when they say things were rushed.Id love to hear reasons as to why people thought the plot was bad but not when theyre all parroting the same thing and dont seem to have much thought into them aside from just being generally upset or contrarian at the loss of content.,metalgearsolid,cuyhaa6,4,t5_2s4hr

You honestly believe that sulked Kojipro members added it so players can at least watch the plot ending? Even though you still dont realize it it would be a fucking horrible decision and genuinely even more bad press for both Kojima and Konami if thatd truly be the case.No developer no publisher with any respect towards fans would even consider doing something like this and say hey we didnt finish it but at least those who purchased the CE can watch it  Im sorry but thats outright stupid.gtTo compare a directors cut of a movie to this game would be to generalize the issue.And we can since were talking about cut content that made its way to the SECE. Everything else about the ending of the actual game or how proper you want to consider it is another discussion. Its cut content that was cut for a reason. It is that simple. And no it absolutely fucking doesnt matter that its logical. Cut content can be as logical as it wants. When the directorproducer decides that it has to be cut for a creative reason then its disregarded and just not part of the canon. Again its a really simple thing.You can disregard my points as arguing for the same of an argument as much as you want your line of thinking is still ridiculous.,metalgearsolid,cuzadqj,1,t5_2s4hr

At no point during the events of mgsv does Venom have to go through what would be an all but certain death kind of situation thereby sparing the real big boss of this experience and in any case BB can handle those situations too judging from snake eater. Venom undergoes great risk on his missions of course but so does any soldier. And why put venom in a coma? If hes so damn loyal then talk with him goddamnit. I dont even care if its hypnosis and we still dont learn until the end. None of this makes sense to me and I love this series.

So basically have  in your waiting room when you expand to guarantee your security team doesnt take too much of a hit. . Their weapons are based on YOUR RampD. Try focusing early research into the GREEN weapons equip them with whatever weapon is the highest. Dont make them use a  bolt action sniper rifle when a  rifle.. Put development into your FOB over Mother Base. The more platforms you have the more soldiers you have AND the longer the run to the goal and the more risk they have to either screw up die or give up and leave.EDIT Added moreI havent done much defending but when youre attacking either go for resources or go for soldiers. The only real way the are profitable is from resources refining them then selling them which takes time ofc. Throwing soldiers off of the platform also does not counts as a kill no negative heroism and removes them from the FOB while they swim back to it after youve left.If you manage to get the jump on someone go for hold ups.

Not to mention that the underlying reason behind most of your actions is to get revenge on what XOFCipher did in Ground Zeroes functionally part of V  we can kind of treat them as one whole game.A lot of the problem is simply that MGSVs cutscenetogameplay ratio is possibly the least dense in the series so they dont show the player a lot about what SkullFace is doing. Its happening offscreen and generally not in the same area as where Big Boss is deployed so its the easiest stuff to write off as supplementary information and so it falls into the background. So Id argue that youre right  the fact that he seems less important is kind of a result of the writing or rather the way the writing presents itself.TLDR  SkullFace is screwed over by the way MGSV tells its story.,metalgearsolid,cv43y9r,6,t5_2s4hr

You dont the game and story are unfinished. Then you proceed to try to justify why the game is in such a shape and again use bullshit circular logic that makes no sense.     Why? Because there is literally nothing left for the story to expand close. Literally. Nothing. Left.Third boy Eli Code Talker Miller Ocelot Quiet Zero Cipher in general. You can sit there and act like the mission  content we were shown is the end of the story Kojima was trying to tell but nothing on the CE disk implies this at all. The fact that the mission in itself creates more questions is just setting itself up to tell more story. The only loose ends this game tied up were Huey and Skull Face. Both of which were minor characters in the grand scheme of things. Theres still shit loads of loose ends they could be tying up in between mission   and the truth.

5143321,0,t3_3lfykv,Im actually a shooting instructor specifically combattactical shooting. First Ill explain a tactical reload. A tactical or administrative reload is reloading while there is still ammunition in the magazine and probably a round in the chamber.The reason you would do this is to keep your gun topped off in case more targets present themselves. More ammo in the gun more time in the fight.The reason I explain this first is if the gun is empty the action will have to be worked regardless in order to load the first round in the magazine into the chamber.Now there are two schools of thought on tactical reloads. One is that you change the magazine on the weapon and continue on. You simply swap the magazine. You trust there is a round in the chamber because the action did not lock back or the magazine was not empty.The other school of thought is that every time you change a magazine you work the action on the weapon in order to load the first round and be absolutely sure there is a round in the chamber.Sometimes specifically on pistols you may ride the slide lock and the slide may not lock back on an empty magazine sometimes the gun may have had a malfunction and had a failure to feed the next round sometimes you just want to be extra sure.Not having a round eject is an oversight.Snake does indeed do this with guns in MGS the first game in the series to actually show a tactical reload.,metalgearsolid,cv5yo08,7,t5_2s4hr

All that matters is the difference between what was intended and what we received especially considering how much of the game the engine the gameplay etc almost make it a given that with more time and money it could have come to fruition. I dont care who was at fault I just feel like weve missed out on something that could have been so incredibly groundbreaking and special. TPP by any games standerds is excellent.

5177447,0,t1_cva2big,I havent played the MG games in a long time so my memory is fuzzy. To be fair I said N but you only see Operation Intrude clearly. Theres no indication as to which mission theyre actually showing.Also the trailer said the missing link that completes the saga  Id say the Metal Gear series is definitely a saga with a missing link  i.e. how Big Boss goes from being the relatively good guy to the bad guy.Having two BBs even explains away why he returns in MG. The only tonal inconsistency is that the last missions we seen the true Big Boss do still leave him as a pretty decently good guy if not gaining a bit of an edge by Peace Walker... whereas Venom truly has seen and done some fucked up things throughout The Phantom Pain so youd expect Venom to be the evil warmongering BB from MG.With that said true Big Boss couldnt have sat in a lowly Cyprus hospital for  years could he? He must have been doing something while Venom was out cold... Ishmael was clearly fit and capable during the hospital scenes whereas Ahab was certainly not.Also another cute tie to Moby Dick in that Ishmael is behind the scenes looking in on Ahabs journey. ,metalgearsolid,cva2lyq,2,t5_2s4hr

Big Boss has absolutely no problem with putting them to work and Ocelot isnt far behind him.gt Huey unleashes a virus in your base and kills a comrade you once you knew and Venom just exiles him with food and water no option to kill him.We already know how Huey dies he commits suicide some years later nearly drowning his stepdaughter in the process. The game explored possible motives for why hed do something like that and implies his exile from Motherbase might have something to do with it.gt Kaz says you have to save Skull Face to save the world even though this is suppose to be about revenge.I dont remember this at all. The only thing close would be when Kaz tells you not to kill Skullface immediately so they can find out what he intends to do with Sahelanthropus and given what they do to him after Sahelanthropus has been dealt with I think its a stretch to call that saving him.gt Youre still playing the band of heroes the good guys stopping evil.Big Boss and Kaz arent heroes. They start a mercenary company and throughout the game take on jobs to kidnap and assassinate people for money. Even back in Peace Walker Big Boss was hiding and developing nuclear weapons and he outright says he doesnt believe in peace. Sure compared to Skullface hes a saint but that shouldnt be enough for us to just give him a free pass on things. ,metalgearsolid,cvdn9t2,1,t5_2s4hr
5207758,0,t3_3mbuwh,Nothing necessary. However an interesting dynamic exists with FOBs.I believe you can still build an FOB without PS. However you cant invade other FOBs and cant deploy into your own FOB when an intruder attacks. However you can still add security to defend your base.FOBs are essentially extra mother bases. You upgrade them in the same way. One difference is each new base will cost more for upgrades and take long to finish building the upgrades. The other is that everything happens in real time. If I upgrade my FOB medical facility it may take  hours. However that will be in real time. If I turn off the PS for  hours then go online again it will be finished. Similarly mining and processing unrefined materials assuming you have the initial facility built will happen based on real time. The next time you connect online it will show you all the work that was done while you were away.To clarify all this occurs if you happen to be online at the time or it all happens at once the next time you log in online.The downside and reason why people are sour over it is that while you are offline other players can still invade your base. When they do so they can steal unprocessed materials and your soldiers not just security personnel. However this is where Direct Contracts come in when you look at your staff. Someone who you selected as Direct Contract cannot be stolen or killed during an invasion. I think your direct contract limits are based on  of your maximum base capacity at the moment. If you get bigger then you can direct contract more people.Also enemies can only steal unprocessed resources and from what I hear they can only steal unprocessed resources that were either mined on your FOB or that you stole from another base. The idea being that you only risk resources that you wouldnt have had without an FOB anyway. Base security does cost GMP. However this cost you are given is only processed when you are attacked which the game doesnt make clear. And the amount you pay is based on how much damage they do during the invasion. So it is more of a maximum cost.NOTE Security is not automatically updated when you add new platforms! If you upgrade your medical facility from level  to level  then you need to update your security manually!!If your security force successfully repels an invasion you get a small reward as well. You can improve your security force by developing weapons that have green names. These are items they can use. Also once you get a security force youll be able to build gear specifically for defense like IR sensors and cameras.Enemies attack only one platform and to win they have to progress through each of the struts. A level  RampD facility will have  struts to go through. However any personnel or resources they steal before losing they do get to keep.As I mentioned earlier anything that happened while you were offline gets processed all at once. So if you dont go online for  weeks and you are invaded  times during that window then any loses you suffered will be applied to your save at that time as well as any benefits as well.From what I can tell the platform your on will also impact your experience. As a PS player I really dont mind FOB but I havent even been invaded since unpgrading my security a week ago. A friend on PC has seen numerous invasions though.,metalgearsolid,cvdq6k2,2,t5_2s4hr

5241416,0,t3_3mq5t3,gtIm not sure I buy that in MG Big Boss sent Solid Snake in to kill Venom. I dont like that theory and I dont think it fits. It makes a lot more sense that Venom and Big Boss would have still been working together at that point. Dont know who is saying that that was never implied. Its always been implied that Gray Fox and Solid Snake were sent in as martyrs. They were rookies sent in by BB to die so it looked like the US was trying to take down Outer Heaven but failing. SS just surprised BB and VS.gtA lot of people also seem to be really confused about Zero. Everyone thought of Zero as a really bad guy before MGS but his characterization in the games never supported that and now we know why.What characterization? All we had was MGS  and MGS  which were  years apart. All we knew was that he was the one ultimately responsible for the Patriots and that according to BB he was attempting to take over the world. Of course we thought he was bad.gtMSF wouldnt have grown to the size it did without ZeroCiphers help and until the end Zero was trying to convince BB to join back up with him.Manipulation which BB and Kaz didnt appreciate.gtAfter the Peace Walker incident Skull Face came onto the scene poisoned Zero and the AI took over.Hindsight is  we have pieces now that show Zero wasnt horrible things just got out of control.gtMGS answers more questions than we realized. The main story presented in the game doesnt matter as much as everything else surrounding it. Does Skull Face matter? Slightly. Do the parasites matter? Slightly. Everything else is the story of Venom Snake and how he ended up at Outer Heaven.No it isnt. You are missing an important piece of info. Diamond Dogs is in the middle of the Indian Ocean Outer Heaven is in South Africa. We can guess that maybe Outer Heaven ended up absorbing DD Mother Base but we are not shown that explicitly and that is what people are angry about. What we really wanted to see and were promised was glossed over in  seconds in a cutscene at the end of the game. In fact that whole Truth mission almost seems like a big middle finger to the audience again like MGS  where Kojima just told us Lol JK BB is gonna head off on his motorcycle and work on the REAL Outer Heaven. I felt more like Kaz at the end than Venom pissed off and betrayed.gtA game based around the real Big Boss creating Zanzabar Land and becoming the head of Foxhound might not have been that exciting. There wasnt a lot of action to be had there but the story of Venom Snake? That is an exciting story. There was a lot to do there.You are making huge leaps in logic here. Take this exact game make BB the protag have Mother Base be in Africa instead of the ocean and boom. You have a plot way closer to what people were hoping for and what we were promised. Also I think you are assuming BB was off working on ZL when MGS V was taking place. No. It is stated at the end that he is going off to work on the real Outer Heaven in the shadows while Venom was responsible for keeping the legend of BB growing.gtThis game also fixes another plot hole from MG and MG. There was what four years between the two games? How did Big Boss create an entire nation in just four years? Zanzabar Land seemed to have been around a long time but nobody knew that Big Boss lead the nation. It makes a lot more sense that he started to build Zanzabar Land in  than .Cant answer that one off hand but it isnt fixed in this game. You are writing plot that just wasnt in the game.,metalgearsolid,cvhs3wb,5,t5_2s4hr

5266123,0,t1_cvkmcyl,Depends on how much you know about genetics. The first Metal Gear Solid game gets a lot wrong but also corrects itself on about half of it. It explains the dominantrecessive thing and then it says Liquid was just told that and then it goes on to say it was actually true but the opposite... so on and so forth. The one thing that is canon for sure is that theyre not identical. They were altered.Thing is if you did just change it so one of them got all of one set of genes and the other got another and you went into the sequence digging for replacement genes and addon all the other alterations like the aging and everything else... realistically youd probably alter so much that they wouldnt seem like a relative.Bear in mind that first cousins are so unrelated that theres a minornegligible increase in birth defects between children from such a coupling. Second cousins are basically no genetically closer to you than a random stranger off the street. It sounds odd because they probably look like you and as explained by memetics act a bit like you. But theres so much white noise in our DNA that the percentage similarity quickly drops. All it would take is enough genetic modifications that the Snakes are on paper cousins. Suddenly the results wouldnt come back as a match. And since the genes being altered arent done in a way nature would IE you couldnt test for paternity youre basically just asking how similar one set is to another and the answer ranges from identical to within margin of error for the general population. So my question after that scene was How realistic are the genetics at play here?. Because the explanation could have been theyre modified so much to enhance them or any number of other things. I thought the reveal was going to be Solidus in Africa as a nearperfect match but the other Snakes not being identical the same way.,metalgearsolid,cvkt0ud,4,t5_2s4hr

5296658,0,t1_cvooydo,Excellent comment. Although the story was underwhelming the true beauty lies in playing the fuck out of V. The narrative may be over but Im well on my way to S ranking all the missions. Its really fun so far to go back and check off all the extra objectives then do the S run with all the rewards that brings using all the endgame RampD developments and knowhow the story play through earns you. Whats more mixing it up is fun using staff instead of Big Boyfriend gimmicksubsistence load outs switching lethalnonlethal etc. The beauty of this game is the sandbox combined with the parameters of each mission. For me the best moments come from unexpected situations where the stealth is really put at the forefront. One of my favorite moments from the game was during Where Do the Bees Sleep? when I had finally moved past the challenge of the Mountain Relay Station and I was riding up the mountain road golden light shining on the rock mist cascading along. I got such a strong MGS feel just like the mountainous area right after The Ladder. So goddamn good. It is quite satisfying to stealth through that mission using box travel and experience it differently with a staff member that doesnt have all the mobility upgrades or rocketo arm. The first time I did it it took roughly four hours and I relished how the mission was this journey with twists and exploration. F yeah. ,metalgearsolid,cvopj7y,1,t5_2s4hr

Everything else seems pretty intentional. Chapter  was the story. Chapter two was an epilogue for the main characters but you cant fit the endings for like eight characters into one mission. They could have filled chapter two out better for a cleaner story flow instead of rehashing old missions though IMO. Dont get me wrong Im not complaining about the game at all.

5308921,0,t3_3nq8q3,If you really arent interested in the FOB stuff the easiest option is to play offline. Konami is trying very hard to push people to play with FOBs in order to push their microtransactions especially with the most recent patch.If someone invades your FOB and succeeds something that is very easy until you substantially build out your FOB and bump up your security levels you will lose some staff each time and if they get into a firefight you will have to pay damage costs as well. Its not a huge amount in the grand scheme of things but it does get annoying.How much you get invaded will be directly related to how high your security level is. You can only increase your security level by developing security items and building additional FOB platforms. This wil cut down on invasions but youll still get invaded and if youre offline youre at the mercy of your online security team to repel the invasion. Personally despite having a security level around  my FOB still gets successfully invaded from time to time and it ends up costing me in lost staff and lost GMP.TLDR Stay offline unless you really want to participate in the whole thing.,metalgearsolid,cvq9yha,1,t5_2s4hr

Nobody is going to buy your original game as it costs  dollars but you cant afford to make it cheaper whereas Konami can. And since its a remake and they arent profiting then under your rules there would be no reason to send a CampD.I understand its an extreme situation but thats what these companies benefit from.

Everything youre assuming beyond when he trained his kids literally goes against facts given in the games. Considering all we see through the series again its easier to see him as a good guy who has done bad things like murder to do what he believes is right.gtBeyond all of that you can look at the fact that Big Boss stripped his most loyal follower of his humanity and personality brainwashed him stole his free will and then sent him on a dangerous mission. Thats also a pretty fucking evil thing to do anyways.Even this is wrong. Ocelot makes it clear that Venom pretty much volunteered to be Big Boss phantom. He did not do it because he was forced to or brainwashed he did it out of loyalty for a man he believes to be right.EDIT to your Edit He did train them. Some of them. When they were older. Again he gives them every chance at a normal life but some of them just dont integrate back into the normal world those are the ones he trains and keeps in his army because in his mind itd be better than them joining some other random group and either getting killed or causing more chaos. He does perpetuate war but not out of an evil malice.

And if you have the right camo in your box you might as well be invisible from a distanceDistract a group of guards with a magdecoy when theyre grouped up just throw a sleep grenade in there or even a smoke grenade and just go in and CQC them while theyre blind.And if you have DD with you you can easily tell your distance from guards then you can use that knowledge to lure them away from other guards with your fist or with DDs bark.,metalgearsolid,cvurd2c,1,t5_2s4hr

Im sorry but Skullfaces plan was all over the place and when broken down piece by piece it doesnt really work. Thats my opinion though so whatever but I saw so much potential with Skullfaces during GZ but in PP he just turns out to be just a mad man with some of the most convenient weaponry ever mantis just appearing and joint him right when BB wakes up man on fire just waking up as well and is conveniently invincible and under Skullface control a robot that took  years to develop but cant be used or controlled until magically mantis shows up good thing zero sent Skullface to Africa to monitor the parasite research. Wow that was a run on sentence but damn everything just conveniently comes together for Skullface when BB wakes up. The ending twist is fine for me. My problem is it just kinda happens. No build up. Just youre venom here are some tapes to explain how this happened. Game over. I still had a lot of fun and I liked how we finally got to hear zeros take on things.

They certainly werent gonna abandon the idea if he said no he was becoming Big Boss whether he liked it or not.gt ... the fact that the medic DID jump in front of the blast to protect Big Boss pretty much speaks for itself.Again its certainly possible but one act of selfsacrifice in the heat of the moment does not equate to a thought out informed and conscious decision to give up ones entire consciousness identity and history as a human being. ,metalgearsolid,cw2dsm7,2,t5_2s4hr

The effect this has on the game is which difficulty levels you will next bepresented with and which chapter you will start on. That is whether you will play the whole game or start halfway through.  So youll want to get this bitright then...      Difficulty Setting              | Start Level    . Normal or Hard   | Tanker level  . Very Easy Easy or Normal       | Tanker level  .

5529151,0,t1_cwic00z,gt Remember that Big Boss is supposed to be evilI feel like we did see Big Boss turn evil just not in the way we thought he would. And it wasnt shown properly in my opinion. What Big Boss did to Venom makes him a pretty selfish bastard I think. Venom saved his life risking his own in the process and loses his arm and eye. Big Boss repays him by letting him he put in a coma for  years and have his past and everything be taken from him just like Skull Faces past was. Yes he seemed okay with it in the final ending when he smiles but it doesnt make it any better. Big Boss made the choice for him and used him like a tool for his own gain. Despite his speeches about soldiers not being tools for governments he turned on that idea to keep himself safe. After being upset and a broken man from learning about the Boss mission where she was used as a tool by the Philosophers he did the same thing to Venom. She willingly did it for her country just like Venom continued to do it. Big Boss also put the people in the hospital in the line of fire killing them all. Normally in MGS games you find out you were manipulated by some higher power the whole time whether its the Patriots or the Philosophers. This time it was Big Boss himself. I dont think it was done perfectly or anywhere close to it. It should have been put together a lot better. But I still like it. ,metalgearsolid,cwiebuu,8,t5_2s4hr

It was such a kick in the guts to see her final mission play out that I was weeping like a little girl towards the end of it because you could see what was going to happen.I felt a genuine sense of grief when she left like no movie or game has made me feel before. I was profoundly sad and found playing on without her I felt so hollow knowing Id never hear her humming again as she covered my arse in the field.I ended up using her themes as my chopper music for the next few days of play as I went through this strange grieving process for a fictional character who had never even had a conversation with my character. After a few days of playing with this hollow feeling I finally came to terms with the fact that she was gone and DD and I continued on with our missions.It was by far the most emotionally impactful thing any game has provided me with.TLDR  The loss of a fictional character with most of her character development occurring in my mind rather than explicitly on screen managed to make me go through the seven stages of grief and it was one of the saddest and greatest sensations and artistic experiences I have ever had.,metalgearsolid,cwjauro,28,t5_2s4hr

Its Solid Snake taking on the base I believeHowever in the events of MG in the timeline it says it was big boss that was defeated.

When he disappears it leaves a great void in the narrative the player who has lost with him the object of his revenge. gtHollywood movies often end with a dramatic contrast between the forces of good and evil which aims to satisfy the spectators. But this games main theme cascading revenge idea and the phantom pain which is born once the object of revenge is no more. It is impossible to express all the subtleties of this theme in the context of a classic boss fight.It proves what many have been thinking that Hideo Kojima intended to leave players with a sense of phantom pain by removing Skullface and the players objective in seeking revenge. I think its a worthy goal but i also think Kojima miscalculated by not explaining it well enough within the game. People thought chapter  was unfinished and all disjointed due to problems in development. Really it seems that chapter  is similar to what Kojima was aiming for he just didnt communicate its differences with chapter  properly.,metalgearsolid,cwqpnqj,6,t5_2s4hr

5605816,0,t1_cwrxwb5,Everyone in the military industrial complex makes a profit from war activities. Take America during World War II prior to the war the country was languishing through the Great Depression. It was only through selling weapons to the belligerents and eventually firing up their own war machine that the country pulled itself out of the depression. From the average citizen to the richest businessman they saw a jump in quality of life due to war due to human death and suffering somewhere far away. Thats in a way profiteering off war. Therefore every American is evil. See how that argument is just a slippery slope of oversimplification?Big Boss didnt want the war economy he wanted a world where soldiers werent tools of the government where they could choose who and what to fight for. The War Economy is the exact opposite of what he wanted a bunch of children indoctrinated by movies and video games going around fighting on a sanitised battlefield?

5608042,0,t1_cwrtuj2,Well theres  different auto aims  one is reflex and one is normal aiming.  The reflex one Im pretty sure is on all the time as long as reflex is.    This allows you to hit aim during reflex and no matter what weapon you turn to face them.  Traditional auto aim exists is able to be disabled but works a bit different.  Each weapon has its own range and this can actually be increased by customizing it one of the mods on the weapon barrel I believe.  It wont  you like this but if youre facing a target and in range it will aim about center mass.The reflex aim during FOBS usefullness just depends on your weapon.   If youre using a shotgun and the guy spots you from M out you wont have time to swap weapons before he alerts.  Also if hes wearing armorhelmet and youre not using a high pen weapon its pretty useless as well.That said most fob players now a days are rocking the stun shotgun and a high powered sniper and neither give a fuck about what armor youre using.    Reflex time also obviously determined by who youre using snake with his upgrades is fairly long and a combat guy with gunman skill has the longest.  Normal soldiers without it have a pretty short reflex time.  Again though the common weapons make it almost a non factor...,metalgearsolid,cws8d1e,1,t5_2s4hr

5813464,0,t3_3utm0o,You looking for good FOB guns?The S AirS is amazing at KOing guards and ignores armor to boot.  Stick a medium grade suppressor on there and youre set.Recently Ive been having the issue where on FOBs when someone inevitably spots me cough bad level design cough and I go into reflex mode.   Problem is that the gun I usually use the AM MRS is too long sometimes.  If youre on one of the metal platforms around the base the railing often ends up getting in the way and theres not enough space to aim and shoot your gun.Hence I needed a gun thats short enough to fire in confined spaces but also packs a solid enough punch to get through the higherend Battle Dresses.  I used the ultrashort version of the G the Gk however I found that while the accuracy was decent it lacked enough punch to down Battle Dress opponents quickly.Somehow this whole time Ive overlooked that theres a shortened version of the SVG that is grade  and shoots . rather than the increasinglyfeeble . Ive been using.If you havent tried the Grade  SVGu definitely go for it.  Its accurate enough for any sort of FOB scenario and packs a whallop.  Put a highergrade suppressor on there and a drum mag and its golden.  Only downside is that it cant use optics but the ironsights are clear enough.,metalgearsolid,cxhpqgf,5,t5_2s4hr

He is a phantom who has learned to manipulate the objects at work around him. This was first hinted at in Ground Zeroes when you rescue the prisoner in Pazs cell in Destroy the AntiAircraft Emplacements. He describes Skull Faces odd interrogation technique where he tries to sympathize with you act like your friend makes you feel that its okay. This is most evidenced by his line The Pain gets to us all. A direct quote from Big Boss which may imply that Skull Face took great influence from Big Boss himself.However I still dont understand Skull Faces motivation. Zero himself said the vocal cord parasite was no longer of interest to him but Skull Face claims on the car ride that Zero wants to use the Wolbachia to destroy all languages excluding English.Did Skull Face believe Zero was lying? Or did Skull Face have some other kind of alterior motive? Morover why did Big Boss and MSF need to be taken out to further Skull Faces plans?

The idea that it was Kaz makes no sense because the truth tapes make it perfectly clear that he has no idea where Big Boss is being kept and isnt trusted by Zero like Ocelot is. Hes only ever informed that Venom has woken up and is apparently put in contact with Ocelot although the latter only tells Big Boss that he has Diamond Dogs prepared and nothing more which would suggest that this is all hes told to do. Seeing as hes attacked and captured shortly after this theres no way he could relay an order to Ocelot  who doesnt take orders from him anyway  telling him to rescue Big Boss  Venom and then himself. Plus Ocelot was by Big Boss side for some period of time especially once he woke up a while before Venom did. So hes already there anyway.,metalgearsolid,cxt8gzp,0,t5_2s4hr

I mean this is BIG news not the usual dribble of vague information and shitstirring attentionseeking tweets from David Hayter etc. So it makes sense that we will see many Kojima related nonmgs posts during this time. The problem is that when people decide to post something they want it to be relevant and to be viewed by the largest audience possible. If the largest audience is on this subreddit but it has been decided that it is supposed to go to the smaller KojiPro subreddit then what will we be left with? Either a relevant but hardly noticed post on the KojiPro subreddit or a post on the wrong mgs subreddit with a big audience and a load of replies saying wait shouldnt this be in the KojiPro subreddit? Excuse me Mod didnt we decide that we cant post this here? I had a really cool post over on the other subreddit but no one saw it.

5980187,0,t1_cy3atyy,See youre making assumptions there you dont know why they removed mission . The cutscene was barely even started and seemingly nothing was in place for the actual gameplay. At its stage it was still just a concept.  No actually you didnt really know that. Kojima said he was done with the series after making  and theres nothing in it that hints at a sequel ocelot simply disappearing doesnt set anything up since he isnt even brought up again. Thats something you can only say since mgs came out and that makes the odd assumption that metal gear is over even though theyve said it isnt. Hell for all any of us know the falling out happened because Konami told Kojima to leave mission  out so they could tie it into a sequel.  Thats a silly reason to me to think the game is unfinished. Your complaint could be solved by removing the chapters or just naming them something different so to me I cant really accept it as a legit complaint if it has such arbitrary solutions. The challenge mission in the second chapter are entirely optional you dont have to play them at all to advance ahead. Your problem again is you making assumptions. You assumed that chapter  despite chapter  being like  hours to beat would be an equal length to chapter  for some reason despite the main plot being tied up with Skullface dead and sahelanthropus captured. Act  epilogue there its fixed now. The appearance of optional recycled missions with tweaks doesnt mean anything.  Did you ever play peace walker? The second act to that is boring as hell with like  missions of playing hide and seek that also required  or  missions to be completed in between.  Is that just padding for the game because its unfinished? How do you make the distinction between when a game is unfinished and when it was simply an addition you didnt like? ,metalgearsolid,cy3j88s,6,t5_2s4hr

Youre right that MPO is the one and only explanation for the other half of the legacy but other than that its not really canon. Its really not required to play either because while the details are left bare MGS which youre supposed to play before PW tells you where the legacy ended up.Dont get me wrong I love MPO but Ive done enough reading into its canonicity to realize where and how it fits in.

6028246,0,t3_3y1v55,Ill give you the basic rundown for FOB Success if infiltrating wear Squares camo and get to the level  S NonLethal Shotgun. That alone will give you an extraordinary advantage.If defending grab your battle dress best grenade launcher and LMG. Id assign your security team to lethal longrange they have ridiculously good detection abilities if theyre alerted and each hit from their rifles will floor an invader. Positively invaluable. Invest in security devices ASAP theyre a bit pricey but they make all the difference in the world.Last but not least if you can try your hardest to avoid being detected while infiltrating. If you dont steal resources damage installations or Fulton personnel the defender wont be alerted and you can get away scotfree. If you can neutralize all the defenders you can try to bag whatever you like but dont get greedy and try beforehand otherwise youll end up with a retaliatory wormhole leading to your FOB that the defender can use. And take my word for it defenders coming at you for vengeance are anything but judicious. They will take back their personnel savage your guards and probably destroy anything they can in order to scare you off. Things can get surprisingly intense...However while the risk is high the rewards are even greater. If youre ambitious careful and believe in the will of The Boss... you will find treasure beyond your wildest dreams.

6221322,0,t1_cywpw3l,First of all it totally does invalidate your argument. There is a stigma surrounding Nazism however righteously founded that stigma may be that invalidates further discussion. Bringing up Nazis also brings up the implicit argumentative point that If you disagree with me you supported the Nazis. It makes the discussion difficult because I now have to discuss certain aspects of morality that might make me look like a Nazi sympathizer when I absolutely am not.The fact that there are droves of Neo Nazis would seem to suggest that some people would agree with Hitlers mentality. And really at the end of the day morality is relative. If Hitler had won the second World War we wouldnt see his actions as evil. Humanity is predisposed to certain ideas based on A societal influence and B biological instincts. We see things as wrong if other people see them as wrong but also if they go against our biological instincts. If we see someone killing somebody we assume that the action is bad in lieu of further evidence because we as social organisms want to see our species live and thrive. Evil is a simplistic moniker we put on people because we dont understand their thought process and because it has effects that WE deem to be negative. BB would never have built Outer Heaven if the US government hadnt callously tossed aside the Boss to achieve its own selfish goals. We just see BB as a villain because everybody said he was bad in Metal Gear . All of those characters had completely selfish reasons for saying that about him especially Kaz. However the mentality that BB is a villain persists because people dont like change. They need him to be this bad guy so that they can validate their idea of him from MG. Its just not that easy.,metalgearsolid,cywspcd,0,t5_2s4hr

I cant help but feel like Kojima in some way planned to make it somewhat unfinished to make people chase after a missing part one that never existed but was made to seem like it existed. Kojima is a smart man and he knew people would have gone digging for more so maybe he intentionally left bread crumbs to a part of the game that was never intended to exist? Obviously it doesnt make up at all for how awful chapter  was.

6251864,0,t3_4161bg,Not really.  Skullface is a part of XOF he was there for the events of mgs and hates Big Boss and Zero for killing the Boss. Skullface stayed in to get close to Zero.  The enriched uranium is going into sahelanthropus sahelanthropus is itself a nuke.  It had nothing to do with it being Zeros native tongue dont know where you got that from. He says his motivation pretty clearly in the Jeep ride.  You mean instead of killing him on the field she got beat? Where you could then either kill her or spare her. She didnt fall in love in a romantic way. She refuses to speak because she doesnt know if she wants to go through with it or not.  Quiet still has lungs they just arent functional. It never says she dies from it anyways she leaves so that the parasites dont spread which dont require lungs since theyre in her throat. They pretty clearly say that it isnt working Im pretty sure the idroid was damaged too no? because of the sandstorm.  He didnt do paperwork he was on the field doing Intel and cleaning up after him. I dont know where he realized those things but alright.  Yes Huey is a sociopath he kills Skullface so he can clear his name.  Mantis is just attracted to strong emotions thats why hes attracted to venom during the hospital escape and makes the big flaming whale and why he is attracted to Shabani wanting to die.  Zero didnt only want to help Big Boss he still considers him his friend but they have differing ideals. Zero wanted Big Boss to be his military arm which was what happened over the course of PW.  Ocelot didnt remember it all of a sudden its a prior conversation. Likely sometime soon after the Phantom limbs mission he tells Kaz and then goes under hypnosis.  They dont explicitly say who theyll be training and for what just that theyre his sons so theyll support them.  Big Boss didnt send Solid Snake to kill Venom.,metalgearsolid,cz09prs,2,t5_2s4hr

6273881,0,t1_cz1q3ab,I think theyre just gauging whether they should put the effort into it in case it might be wasted. Theyd have to announce the game right before launch if they wanted to catch Konami off guard but then it might not have the desired exposure. Plus it might piss them off so much that theyd see this little troupe of fan devs as a bunch of cocky shits who need to be put in their place.So they instead poked the bear early to see if it cares. Rather than pour years of effort into it assuming its comparable to Black Mesa only to find that hardly anyone knows about it right at launch as well as needing to fend off Konami in a legal battle theyre unequipped for. Plus Konami might see this as an opportunity to play the generous god card and give them their blessing being that they announced their intentions early. Not that Konami cares about PR at this point.I agree in principle in that I hate hype. I waited years for Black Mesa after they released a supposed launch trailer back in  and Im still waiting for them to finish it. But given their limited size of production and that its usually probono work their hands are sort of it tied.For example in Black Mesas instance Valve could have slapped it down as early as their initial announcement which was back when they had hardly anything to show for it and the team couldnt have done anything about it. But instead they gave it their blessing and eventually allowed them to sell it as an official remake on Steam.They could have kept on working secretly for years and then decided to announce it only to find that Valve wanted to take legal action and stop the production. Then theres not to mention the possibility of a similar production existing due to them not announcing theirs earlier.,metalgearsolid,cz2rpkt,1,t5_2s4hr

Venom wants to remember the good parts of the old days but they still haunt him. The shrapnel and the arm will never let him forget. Makes me tear up just thinking of when she says ... My flesh my bones joining the silt on the ocean floor... because part of me still wanted to believe it was Paz.Theres something that doctor says at the beginning. There is shrapnel we couldnt remove in your skull and near your heart.

6369794,0,t1_czdo84u,Youre part right.  What youll notice is that if youre at full capacity if you fulton a soldier who is better than a soldier on your roster the previous soldier will be fired and and the new soldier will go into your brig.If you do an FOB raid and secure say  S Ranks it will dismiss your  lowest soldiers in that unit while the new ones go to the brig.  At max capacity its not uncommon to see your units level down after getting new soldiers since theyre in the Brig instead of the unit.When you buy Soldiers from PF Rewards Event Rewards or Challenge Rewards theres nowhere for them to go since you have no waiting room.  Unfortunately the game doesnt treat them as Volunteers and instead checks your roster before allowing you to purchase them  presumably using the same logic as it does for redeeming resources which is designed to stop you wasting the purchase e.g. buying bunch of Fuel when your fuel is capped accepting GMP when your bank account is maxed.,metalgearsolid,czdoc44,0,t5_2s4hr

He knew he couldnt do this by himself so he basically made it look like The Bosses orders and everyone would be okay with it because they idolized the boss.In MGSV the player doesnt really have much freedom you are always running around following whatever Miller or Ocelot want you to do but for the most part its Miller using you to fight the war against Cipher that he cant fight.Venom really doesnt ever seem to give a shit about Cipher.,metalgearsolid,d01o623,2,t5_2s4hr

But he isnt sure.Then he gets back and has a chat with Ocelot. Who reveals that you only think youre Big Boss. Which makes Miller question what hes just spent the last nine years doing.

Even in a place where no new story developments come through we see Big Boss develop as we develop while playing him. We definitely see him as the guy from MG but we also see glimpses of him being a really good guy. In a game where we literally see a misinterpretation of the Bosss will I think its interesting that Big Boss has never been closer to the Boss on a thematic level.

In  though I always feel like Im destroying the soul of someone when I say I just plain dont care about most of the characters at all even the Boss. The gameplay is my favorite next to V but her speeches always felt really awkward long and out of place.

7210315,0,t3_4e4vlx,Look Im going to lay out what I think about it plain and simpleIt is the worst MGS game ever made. But it is the best stealth game ever made.The fact that you have  freedom is a fantastic achievement. Its not notional like in other games this is truly and open world game. It may feel like separate missions but if you roam around the open world instead of deploying in by chopper every time you see how it really is just laid out in front of you to do whatever you want.This comes at a cost however.. Total freedom means that the narrative cant be constrictive. The story honestly was fine. Its no worse or ridiculous than any other MGS plotline and peoples perception of it is skewed by the lack of strong linear narrative like in previous games and the fact that skullface didnt get enough screen time and the ending is literally They flew away the end. Fuck off that ending though seriously. If you cant provide the mission  ending then just change the ending to eli sabotaged salehanthropus and escaped via thrid child. Eli story resolved selahanthropus resolvedGZ was fine as a prelude whatever but they shouldnt have let slip the stuff that they didnt get to finish. If they had said that the story was missions  spanning  huge open world maps that would have been fine. But they kept bigging it up to the point where i genuinely thought there would be a third map and a second chapter. THAT IS A FUCK UP. Labeling the limits of the game would have eliviated the sense of lackluster that the game received. Stating that there are  MAPS and NO SECOND CHAPTER would be fine. Dont call it chapter  you prick just call it post game content you UTTER FOOLS. Once I got over my fanboy butthurt and looked at it the game is fine. If you stop your emotions getting in the way and look at it objectively it is a fucking great game with a great wacky Kojima story the only difference is that its formatted differently to accommodate gameplay over Cinematic experience.,metalgearsolid,d1xr8s5,1,t5_2s4hr

But I wish there was some kind of gameplay twist to it. Not just a repetition. That is what I kind of expected from a Kojima game playing with the unique elements of the medium. And I want to believe that there was more to it at one point.To be honest I wouldnt be so sure about that. Although Im only somewhat certain that Kojima said he met the games deadline and didnt exceed the budget a while ago I do remember quite clearly an interview with the voice director Kris Zimmerman who said she didnt understand during the rest of the games development why they recorded the ending first albeit she didnt know it was the ending at the time until later on i.e. when it turned out the last mission was a repeat of the first with the added scenes. Heres the interview with the exact time mark to be precise. This makes sense because if you remember back to the GDC trailer the first one of the game they showed off practically all of the hospital including the final scene with Big Boss from the truth ending though differing slightly probably to avoid spoilers.,metalgearsolid,d2m0mlb,-2,t5_2s4hr

8517786,0,t1_d6610wb, is the exact amount afaik I dont work there so obviously I could be off read that number on reddit lines up with the math of my losses.  The only way  to lose is if you manually fuck up your direct contracts like take it off the top  of your crew and lock in a bunch of E grades.  And frequently update it to not protect your top troops.  Or invade  people a night unsuccessfully and break blockades as fast as you can load religiously but even then I believe the  cap keeps your FOB earning.  Its a vital function of the mechanic to keep hackers from cleaning all of us out.  Their gains are multiplied by your lossesbut out of thin gaming air not your resource stores.  You lose  but when you rob someone the  you take gets multiplied several times over based on your scores character equipment espionage ranking vs the enemies etc etc etc.  Its all too on every aftermission FOB score screens.Where the fuck did the FOBphobia come from anyways?

Its likely he was in the US military before then and its possible he could have had a wife and kids.However the men and women who joined MSF usually didnt have strong ties back to any country.

I mean venom in TPP had frictions with kazmillermaster mcdonald miller etc so many fucking names for that character...yeesh because they differed in some of their outlooks i.e. whether or not to kill quiet and so by the point of MG outer heaven isnt the same as it was in TPP but rather a dangerous organisation that is threatening the world with a nuclear weapon in the form of metal gear  therefore miller wants venom to go down not the real big boss because of this on top of all the past resentments. surely this makes more sense than miller just deciding to hate the real big boss that runs away before TPP for no real reason? ,metalgearsolid,d6ir4qn,1,t5_2s4hr

8869742,0,t3_51ollm,You have some severe misconceptions about playing MGSV online. First off one million GMP is chump change you can make that in less than ten minutes playing the super easy event FOB thats currently running. No one possibly excluding the most assholish of griefers want to steal rank C and B soldiers they just arent worth it. Same goes for the undoubtedly small amount of resources you most likely have. You havent even done the FOB mission yet so it is impossible for other players to come in and raid you at this point. Playing offline will cap you to  million GMP which you will hit surprisingly fast even if it doesnt seem like it right now. Playing offline without FOBs will also severely kneecap your resource gain and staff limits which will hurt you in the long run if you want to continue playing after you reach the end of the singleplayer campaign. If you plan to completely abandon the game after mission  then by all means forget about playing online and disregard everything Ive said. But if you plan to play longer and possibly go for  develop higher end itemsweapons expand your own FOB play the event FOBs or start raiding FOBs it is in your best interest to play online.,metalgearsolid,d7e0nva,9,t5_2s4hr

There have been a couple of leaks which suggest they have zero respect for the creative artists that made their games  including people like Kojima and Akira Yamaoka.

As a MG fan of almost all cannon games Im sorry but MG and MGSS are fun but didnt age half as well as the other cannon games I just dont see the point of calling it Metal Gear.  Id be perfectly fine with Konami just taking MGSV making a zombie mod out of it and saying fun fact these soldiers are old mother base soldiers who came to this world after their demise as punishmentthrough a wormhole for their sins and are trying to escape back to the world they know but we wanted to do something completely different and didnt want to call it a Metal Gear game because it has only a few similarities despite it being about people from that familiar universe.   Like Prometheus never saw that movie but it takes place before Alien and is in the same universe to my understanding but theyre not calling it Alien Origins or anything like that because its something different.  Or Quinten Tarantino movies all take place in the same Universe but hes not numbering them or saying theyre related to each other because of a character in one film being related to another or some bullshit.  Theyre just milking the Metal Gear title for its name because a new IP that is a clone of MGSV with zombies wouldnt sell that well.

However in doing so I do agree the story was really good as short as it was but the game felt like just a demo or beta even. Not due to its length but just the feel of it. Controls are clunky graphics lighting and sounds feel downgraded a bit. Just the limitedness of the game was enough for me to be ready to get back to TPP.

And Shinkawa says for him its about having bipdel walking machines.Then Kojima mentions how the Famicom Metal Gear game doesnt have a Metal Gear. And they concluded with the joke that every Metal Gear game theyve made has a Metal Gear in it.Which is exactly your point. So no hes. not being a hypocrite because he said exactly what you said.In addition he didnt talk about Survival of his own accord. He was asked by emcee and he answered the question.I really think ppl should stop jumping to conclusions or talking about something they dont have all the information on.You think Kojima sounds hypocritical or that he was talking shit?

I instantly fell in love. Have about  hours in the game and still going strong after  months of picking it up. In the middle of the story my friend who is a long time MG fan recommended I pick up GZ since he knew how much I was liking the game so it would help shed some light on things in TPP that I didnt fully understand. Plus he said it was just a really good game despite only being in one area and so short. So I got it. It was cool and all and the sneaky part definitely came into play more but thats all it was for me. Be sneaky go from point A to point B and when youre done you have nothing to show for your success. While maybe this is what the franchise normally is Im sure its great. Ive heard the stories are amazing and very in depth and Im sad I missed out on the older stuff.

9185012,0,t3_563k5h,Very much. Calling my support team in different situations in order to see what they have to say was always like  of the enjoyment I got from MGS.The tapes are fine but in my opinion a weak replacement for the codec simply because they dont allow for conversations that are related to your current situation. Things like hiding in a locker staring at a poster of a woman and then calling Otacon who catches Snake masturbating... not possible with tapes because they dont happen in the moment. Same thing goes for killing birds and then getting scolded by Naomi going to the ladies bathroom and having an awkward conversation with Rose entering an elevator to have a conversation with Otacon about the remaining Stealth Camos... all things that arent possible with tapes.The result is that I feel a much greater divide between gameplaySnake and storySnake. In the past Snake could talk.. during his mission.. at any time I wanted. Yes it was a separate screen but it still felt like it happened right there. With the way MGSV handles it I feel like the Snake I control is a separate Snake from the one I see in cutscenes and tapes because the Snake I control is a mute avatar that listens to conversations the real Snake had in his absence...In my opinion they can keep the tapes for exposition background information mission briefing etc but should bring back the codec in its original form for conversations that happen during the mission. ,metalgearsolid,d8g9n2o,10,t5_2s4hr

9252597,0,t3_574b2v,I recommend you start with MGS on PS via your digital download code that came in the gamecase. When you play MGS hold down the PS button on your controller and go to Other Change the Screen aspect to Widescreen Also make sure under your controller you have it set to Analog so your joysticks function.  Also note that you can change discs through that menu MGS is a  disc game and you can change controller slots if you need to.  This game breaks the rd wall in the fact you may need to look at the physical game case for information needed to complete the game. Like the physical retail CD case that says Playstation   I believe this is an option when you hold the PS button also to view the instructions. and see what the retail case looked like. Wont tell yeah what to look for but keep an ear out when someone tells you to look at the CD case.Definitely recommend pushing through the PS MGS game first as all of the following games build on its foundation and even MGSV the Phantom pain heavily ties with that  game. Metal Gear Solid  Story may get confusing a little at the end This sub will fill you in once you complete it. Metal Gear Solid  A fan favorite for many well rounded.. you will really enjoy the Ride.

The amount of MGSV assets used controls alone even if they reskinned every model theres no way it would be a positive reception. It would just be Oh great they ripped everything out of TPP and are trying to pass it as a new game.

If you care about just the game mechanic as a game mechanic and arent interested in the metamessage at all then I agree that they should just fix it so its more fun to play. But for people who care about the meta message and thats not just something we made up and attribute to Kojima its something the Konami community rep here on reddit specifically pointed out then it needs to remain hard. Yes there could be a compromise that would make it playable yet still hard which would be fine but I think it would still kinda invalidate the messageexperiment a bit.

10264907,0,t3_5mxu4a,Remember folks up to Act . Googling the story will spoil a lot so dont worry. If youre not sure Id recommend rewatching the Briefings inside the cargo plane to get whats going on.So Liquid Ocelot is Liquid Snakes ghost remember the Sorrow ghostsparanormal exist in MGS that was able to take over Ocelots body through the arm  we see in MGS that Ocelot replaced his right arm with Liquids after Shadow Moses because it was on hand pardon the pun and getting an official transplant wouldve alerted the Patriots. Basically while its Ocelots body and voice a much better change than in MGS when Liquids voice came out which felt silly IMO what did he change Ocelots vocal chords? imagine its Liquid from MGS especially in physicality.We know from MGS that the worlds governments well essentially the USs but the US holds such a power sway that its effectively global are run by a shadowy organization called The Patriots. Since youve finished Act  youll have learned that The Patriots are the successors of The Philosophers who were around since WW and became corrupt and greedy that was founded after Operation Snake Eater by the people that were affected most by the Boss betrayal and felt betrayed by the US Big Boss Zero ParaMedic Sigint EVA and Ocelot. Effectively being run by Big Boss and Zero who had a falling out when Zero worried about Big Boss after he fell into a coma yes folks there was one presumably short around . Remember BB was technically in a coma in between virtuous mission and snake eater it doesnt have to be decades long and took some of BBs DNA to produce clones. BB and Zero fell out because BB saw this as being violated and ended up going off to make what became Outer Heaven and Zanzibar while Zero kept his control on the US until he effectively controlled the entire worlds decision making all the while growing more paranoid remember Zero was born in  and so Zero created the Patriot AIs because he felt no one could carry out his will better. These AIs oversaw the control and shaping of world society you met one GW from MGS who was tasked with digital information control. Now because of MGS when Arsenal Gear smashed through Manhattan yeah and we thought  was bad the US was seen as aggressively creating super weapons remember only four years before the specs for Metal Gear were leaked and so they werent trusted on the world stage. The Patriots seeking to keep control invented SOP Sons of the Patriots in order to control the worlds wars. It basically ensures that every soldier injected with it can only fire a gun missile or pilot a plane with their consent. Otherwise it all locks down. Theres also some emotional and sense control. Now that they were in control and the US army shamed the Private Militaries that were once small and widespread youll see more about that in Peace Walker and V flourished creating a War Economy where War was the pillar of economic trade not oil. In the time between MGS and  Liquid Ocelot managed to gather most if not all IMVHO PMCs under his control under various companies that are connected to the greater Outer Heaven PMC. The UN isnt blind to this and have tried to investigate what hes trying to do but their investigators end up dead so they ask for Solid Snake who stopped Liquid once before. Theyre straight up telling him that they want him to assassinate Liquid the head of the worlds largest company because of his political power. Hes not a military threat because technically SOP would stop any plan in a heartbeat but they still want him out of the picture. In Act I Old Snakes mission is to assassinate Liquid.Now we learn in Act  that Liquid is seeking to control SOP and take out the Patriots from within the system. Liquids goal is to take control of the SOP system and use it to destroy the Patriots. Remember he took control of Ocelot who knows the Patriots weaknesses. For this he needs the genetic code of Big Boss to try to access the system his own DNA didnt work as you see in Act  and in Act  Solids code doesnt work despite being clones their genes are just that much different than BBs so he finds the location of BBs corpse which had been kept alive on a cellular level by Zero in his madness as an icon after Big Boss burned to death in Zanzibar in Metal Gear  on the MSX and uses it to access the SOP System. In full control he takes out the UN taskforce that was sent to undisclosedEuropeanCountry probably Hungary or Czech Republic IMO to arrest him.Now at the end of Act  Liquid reveals that he managed to reconstruct GW and is now essentially able to use it to hide within the greater Patriot system masking his orders as their own like a parasite. He reveals that he wants to destroy JD the main overseeing Patriot AI in order for the System to place his corrupted GW as the overseeing AI. With his GW in place Liquid would essentially be free to mold the world the way he wants Outer Heaven. Theres a bit of a leap yes but basically Liquid wants to take full control of the Patriots to create Outer Heaven a state in which war flourishes across the world without end basically his same motivation as in MGS just that now he realises that he has to take control of the Patriots first rather than a military uprising using a super weapon to leverage the US to his demands.As for Solid Snake its simple He knows hes dying and wants to kill Liquid. In the space of five years hes gone from physically late s to mid s his aging is out of control because of the way his genes were built and we learn in Act  that the FOXDIE in his system threatens to become an epidemic as in could mutate to attack ANY host. He knows he has to die and soon and so made it his last mission to take out his brother and rival Liquid. While in MGS Snake is very idealistic and freewilled in MGS at least IMO hes more driven by pain and revenge.

V dealt with some great metaphysical aspects that clearly gave not context to but an understand of Big Boss...due to the game allowing me to experience exactly what he did being used manipulated fighting for a cause that becomes twisted etc.  Plus the themes of RaceEffects and Exploitation of RevengeA Phantom Pain were some of my personal favorites.

10735058,0,t1_ddn6y73,gtSurVive wouldnt really have any effect because the damage has been done in a sense.That is true I dont know under what courts and in what countries CanalPlus would seek restitution But it may be that they could sue for each title that contains the content which infringes on their copyright meaning that releasing yet another title with Snake in it would add to another on the laundry list of titles that would seal their fate so to speak. It seems like a course to minimize loss not necessarily avoid it completely because they cant.They also have in their favor the fact that you cannot get any of the older Metal Gear titles new in print or distributed online Only Ground Zeroes and Phantom Pain although a good question to ask would be why havent they pulled those from Steam and other distribution sources the likely answer is since they were so expensive to produce theyre still looking to collect from them and havent received any cease and desist letters or any other substantiated threat of legal action However CanalPlus lawyers probably understand that the money from all those previous games has long since been spent developing the successors to each title.In my title I did specify that it might be A reason and not the only reason they decided not to pursue another MGS title as a sequel to TPP or continue off in another direction that needs Snake as a character in the story but it is curious that they are still using the IP in a massively different way sans Snake. I think considering all the backlash that they are undoubtedly aware of unless they have a brain dead and deaf PR team releasing Survive under a different name minus the Metal Gear universe would probably have been better received by their audience.,metalgearsolid,ddn8oat,0,t5_2s4hr

Or at least not in the form were used to.gt MGS can be as good if not better without him if you at least show some sort of support for the people who are still working on it. Thats what everyone said about Silent Hill too..Edit  Heres the thing not to sound condescending but anyone who believes Metal Gear will be the same without Kojima is incredibly delluded.  There can never be another true MGS game because Kojima like every other creator has his own unique style and vision.  No one can replicate his way of thinking its impossible. Not because hes a god but because hes an individual with his own MEMES.  Now does that mean the series will crash and burn...its hard to say.  You claim we need to be supportive because right now were treating Kojima as some holy figure.  But most people Ive seen arent doing that at all.Lets take a step back.  Ever hear of Ghost in the Shell?  Its a manga that has incredible amounts of depth focusing on genesmemes human tendencies and whether that defines an individual transcend emotions and parts of personalities as their own being among other ideas ranging from social to political themes.  In  the manga was adopted into an anime.  There were some changes and a bit of hesitation but ultimately it succeeded.  Two more separate anime series were created both reenvisioning the manga while keeping its core the themes and ideology consistent.In about a month a live action movie is going to be released.  And many arent into it.  Among plot and character changes one point is constantly brought up...the people behind it previously worked on large summer popcorn films.  Should we be supportive?  Honestly I think being cautious in this case is the only way to proceed.  I may sound like a biased evil individual but I dont trust someone whose main work was Transformers to provide a thought provoking thematic experience the manga and anime offered.Now lets get back to MGS.  The Ghost in the Shell anime parallels two things Rising and MGS.  Guns of the Patriots was the first game without Fukashima.  Naturally there was a bit of hesitation.  However upon release quality aside the game still fit with the basic concept of MGS use the gameplay story and characters to express ideas.  More so Rising is a better example.  Kojima had little to no input and it was instead lead by Tamari.  This is like the next set of GitS animes.  A new lead director new writer but they knew what they were doing.  And whether one likes Rising or not they cant deny that it at least has the MG flair.Then we come to SurVive the equivalent of the new GitS movie.  We dont know much about SurVive but like the live action film looking at past records speaks volumes.  If Im not going to trust the guy who worked on Transformers with GitS why would I trust Konami when they funded Silent Hill Homecoming and...grr...Book of Memories?  What theyve done to other franchises isnt a good indicator of where MG will go.  Im not bowing down to Kojima Im being cautious because Ive already went through this before. Fool me twice...Now with all that said You know who else is deluded?  Anyone that views Konami as the devil.  The truth is Konami isnt a game publisher theyre practically a department store.  When Kojima goes to ask for more funds all theyre seeing is how much theyre spending on games...which arent their main seller.  Even though MGSV made back the development cost the profit still pales in comparison to what Pachinko machines reward them.Kojima Team Silent and everyone under them were always developing on borrowed time.  Their relations were never going to end in any other way than they did.All in all I dont see why I should be praising Konami for their new direction or even supporting it.  Im not saying its bad or wrong but that Im not into it.  Theyve proved that as a fan the company isnt on my side.  Understandably so however.  But just because I see their side doesnt mean Im going to buy into what they try and feed me.Im not even against SurVive but until I have proof that the gameplay story and characters are all there to make a detailed extensive point...Im not interested.,metalgearsolid,de1cmn7,8,t5_2s4hr

He listens to those tapes and its Big Boss giving him the final order to die in his place making Big Boss exactly like the American Government who sent The Boss to die for them.I took it as he is visibly angry and enraged that Big Boss is basically betraying him like this after relying on him to build up the legend and then leaving him out to dry so he can start the real Outer Heaven Zanzibar LandHe is punching the mirror in anger and walks through the smoke to fight Solid Snake.,metalgearsolid,de2ne86,28,t5_2s4hr

Getting fucked over by The Man Who Sold The World himself really swats it out of the field for the series and was a great decision. Remember who ends up still wearing the Bosss bandana when all is said and done us as players got to wear it as Venom Snake the Doctor the confused ghost our addition to Big Bosss corpse stinking legacy. John couldnt fit the fucker over his gigantic head at this point.The difference is when Venom was in denial he acted in a morally decent for his profession way to his friends and was very open to the suggestions of others.

I LOATHED the combat system in the first one and after playing the tutorial bit I noped right out of it. The second one has some issues that bother me a bit but the third is smooth and manageable.As far quality and quantity goes it all depends on how deep you look into things. There are quests where you can come to a very wrong conclusion and end the quest right then and there. If you do that you cant pick the quest back up and reinvestigate or anything its over. There are also times where you have to make a very quick decision which can affect the outcome of a quest an entire story arc or the outcome of the game.

For whatever reason probably because everyone LOVES MGS SOOO MUCH whoever was in charge prioritised mission  over mission  and shipped that as the ending.

Now were starting to see directors who actually give a shit and are willing to sacrifice their own vision a bit to make sure the film stays faithful to the source material. These guys actually read comic books and know what goes into these characters. The same has to happen with video games.

11231835,0,t3_60b9iq,TLDR MGS MGS MGSV Peace Walker MGS MGSPersonally I can only talk about all the Main entries starting with Metal Gear Solid up to The Phantom Pain.My favorite entry is Metal Gear Solid  Subsistence specifically for the Camera. Great writing great music great gameplay great atmosphere great characters great great great great. I really dig it.After that it gets a bit more difficult because I consider them all exceptional.I would say my number two is well number two. Metal Gear Solid  left a big impression on me. Particularly its boss battles For which most Metal Gear games are known to be fair the music and its ending which was just... So weird yet affecting. Its a game that had a lot to say.My number three would be Metal Gear Solid V. Im considering The Phantom Pain and Ground Zeroes as one title because GZ could easily be incorporated into TPP. Theyre the same stylistically. The reason MGSV gets third in my opinion is strictly for the gameplay. While the story can be interesting at least visually from time to time the gameplay is what shines. The newest MGS is the most modern and emergent of them all which is probably no surprise.For number four I would have to say Peace Walker. I honestly dont remember a whole lot from this one but what I do remember was generally enjoyable. It is lower on the list because of its structure. I personally dont enjoy the mission select structure as much as the plot progression from previous games. At least it still has Hayter PHopefully Im not crucified for putting it this low on the list but my number five would be the OG Metal Gear Solid. Again I think all these games are great so having it this low is certainly not a mark against it. This game did great things for stealth titles as well as game storytelling in general. I might go as far as to say it was revolutionary but its hard to be sure as I was very young when it was released. There are certainly several memorable moments from this one and the music is downright iconic. As are some of the sound effects. Great game. Ive got respect for it.Lastly at number six is Guns Of The Patriots Metal Gear Solid . The reason for this placement is the pacing. The cutscene to gameplay ratio is kinda crazy even by Metal Gear standards. Theres an entire chapter that mostly consists of following someone through a city and on repeated playthroughs it can be pretty monotonous. But again its still a really solid game Pun semiintended. The boss fights are still quite  memorable and the moment to moment gameplay can be quite enjoyable. I think it just couldve used a bit more of it.,metalgearsolid,df543km,1,t5_2s4hr

11264455,0,t3_60oetm,Now MGS retcons a lot but the one you mentioned definitely doesnt happen from what I remember. The way MGS describes MGS is that the simulation was actually a reallife situation. It was a flexing of the Patriots power to see how well they could recreate MGSs plot in real life. The Colonel and Rose were both based off of real people in real life and the point of MGS was to make you wonder whether it was real the whole time or up to certain point etc.Basically MGS did happen in the real world but with all the strings pulled by GW. When GW began to crash and burn in the end so too did their handle on the situation.I understand that PreMGS the reality of MGSs story was questionable but I still thought it would be weird for the Patriots to be all proud that they successfully simulated The Shadow Moses Incident in a computer when they had the power to recreated it for real..,metalgearsolid,df8t5m6,1,t5_2s4hr

The MGS mechanics on the MGS design makes the game dirt easy to the point that one boss fight is completely pointless. Plus you get nonlethals in TTS.However you made a good choice with the original MGS. I believe they changed a few actors some of the soundtracks and definitely edited some cutscenes. Not to say these changes were bad but some are definitely questionable. Mainly its the edited cutscenes which are super overthetop.
