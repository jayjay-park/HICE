4962237,0,t3_3isio2,Whoa... you can get extra hands with technology? Anyone know how thats achieved? Patch notes sound good a bit of a buff for twoweapon fighters with extra hands in flurry which is nice since the rest of the dual wield tree doesnt affect extra hands.,cavesofqud,cuk11qj,2,t5_394wv

10261481,0,t3_5musnq,THIS PLEASE! I also made a post on the Steam forum too! I was trying out STREGO builds all day yesterday and god damn are they bad compared to a ShankEgo build! But this doesnt mean shank is OP imo. It just showcases how underpowered Str and the other weapon skill trees are. The s are all so low for the passives and dont get me started on how hilariously bad the LB stances are. ,cavesofqud,dc770ug,2,t5_394wv

11166518,0,t1_dexodll,Congrats you do! The cure can be found in a book called the Corpus Somethinorother. Corpus something. sounds latin. The ApeMayor of the village east of Joppa in the jungles cant think of the name has it on him. The cures for things get randomized every game so you need the book to figure it out and it can sometimes be a nightmare gathering all the ingredients. Its actually a good idea to screen shot the whole book so if you get another disease down the road you dont need to worry about carrying it around with your forever. ,cavesofqud,dexpokf,2,t5_394wv
11564157,0,t3_64zq16,Havent done hard testing on it but Im  sure world map movement is far slower in terms of in game time. Which means that youll use up a lot more food and water than if you had gone by foot.Personally I use it quite a lot. Mostly because I almost always take Photosynthetic Skin so I tend to want to make lots of long distance trips. Walking halfway across the world map and back multiple times gets really tedious if you dont use the world map.,cavesofqud,dg6sw8x,3,t5_394wv
