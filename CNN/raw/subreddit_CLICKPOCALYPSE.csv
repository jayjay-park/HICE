804022,0,t3_23c4t6,I really like this idea. My worry is that given how difficult it is to balance a game like this Id screw up the skill bonuses and make things way too easy  Thats fixable of course it just takes lots of testing and adjustments.  Also a simple and intuitive UI would have to be figured out.Ill add this to my list of possible features in addition to things like boss monsters quests special character abilities eg. barbarian rage   seconds of increases cps regions etc.Thanks for the suggestion!,CLICKPOCALYPSE,cgvo5oc,1,t5_31a1s
1011857,0,t1_chaejyj,I dunno the ones Ive played have rewarded activity. With Cookie Clicker the automation java apps allow  of the production to come from activity.With OSTM farming a the highest level area you can kill the whole screen in  click generate goldironwood faster than idling and generates XPSP as well.Same with Idle Mine at least to Hellstone lvl. ....So far with Clickpocalypse the only time I see clicking affecting much is during Mouse ability... and Im not sure its too much.,CLICKPOCALYPSE,chjb0ej,1,t5_31a1s

2856810,0,t1_cnsrw1x,  I have spent no time trying to balance goldThe point was to give a rough idea of where each resource lies in relation to the other. Gold determines when the game ends pretty much. When the game ends characters will be lvl ish depending on player attention. Thats enough to completely fill out the current skill trees. The bone resource lags super far behind I dont think I got half the stuff yet. It may be worth reducing bone costs or using the prestige system to give more bones.,CLICKPOCALYPSE,cnstikr,1,t5_31a1s
3526615,0,t3_30ltg7,They can go up  levels. I think the best strategy is to retire them as soon as possible and to unlock tougher tiers as soon as you can beat them.  Higher tiers drop better items and yield more XP. ,CLICKPOCALYPSE,cpu9bxc,4,t5_31a1s
3790704,0,t3_33sm3n,gt Any chance we could have bosses in the dungeons?Yes. My current plan is for boss encounters to be hard fights against randomly generated evil parties. So youll be up against other wizards fighters rangers ninjas and things like that. gt Also chests and tresure rooms with a low chance of showing up.Im planning on adding treasure chests and weapons racks.  Im going to make it so that the characters wont loot those things unless you are actively playing and click a loot button. Im trying to think of ways to let the player improve the rate of progress by actively sitting there and doing stuff.  I may make boss encounters only happen if the player clicks some kind of summon dungeon boss button at the right time.Treasure rooms are a cool concept but that will have to wait for a future update.gt You could have a story behind the whole thing too...That would definitely help but that will also need to wait for a future update.,CLICKPOCALYPSE,cqodcss,4,t5_31a1s

4323318,0,t1_cscvzvy,Skipping cantrips would be obvious if it wasnt for the useful skills in those branches sp regen and I dont even know if thats worth it.  Spell cooldown could stand to be rethought too sometimes you only take a spell because it turns out your casters keep standing around doing nothing despite having full mana and character cooldown and again I dont know if having cantrips for that is a net benefit or not.Druids seemed okay to me but I wasnt looking at stats then.  I can say that one level  party had a necro with M damage compared to a  ninjas  stealthless rogues  and electromancers .  Chance is a part of that but its a decent picture I think someone must have similar with a druid party.Damage stats dont count overkill right?  Imagine aoe at a hp rat scoring as full aoe damage would skew things.  Likewise aoe damage is scored for all targets hit?,CLICKPOCALYPSE,cscyth4,2,t5_31a1s
4328583,0,t3_3ak1km,I noticed that this update changed the look of potions already in use.  Previously when a potion was active the duplicated were greyed out.  Now they just lose the border if unusable.  Was this purposely done?,CLICKPOCALYPSE,csdk72f,1,t5_31a1s
4500260,0,t1_csxwna8,ltnodsgt  Id personally be wary of this implementation mostly because most people dislike nerfs and lets be honest it is.  So some bonus thing to counter it?  Or some other way to obtain it?  No idea.  Turns out game design is hard D,CLICKPOCALYPSE,csxwu07,2,t5_31a1s

4574220,0,t3_3dmkkr,Yup looks like doors are a bit strange. My characters are cutting into walls when going through doors. A fix for this might be to actually make the doors wider and fill the entire side of the tile or perhaps double doors?. Just a suggestion. However they are going through the doors now so it is a very nice graphical upgrade and much nicer. Im running a  macbook pro and no problems with the graphics...not that there would be with latest gear just thought you might want the info. ,CLICKPOCALYPSE,ct76ts0,1,t5_31a1s
