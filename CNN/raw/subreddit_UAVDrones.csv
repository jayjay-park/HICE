2755975,0,t1_cng1ike,Pixhawk in a UAV Droidplanner with follow me. It is not a super simple process but works. Major hurtle is the cost of a tabletphone with Android and USB Host working right for it. The automation is amazing. From following including relative location to whats being followed to controlling camera tilt and I think pan if you desire. If you want mapping flight paths statue scans all just require a press of  or  buttons. Once its running it is amazingly powerful. Just FYI. Between the air dog and the hexo my money is on the air dog for now. The Hexo is a Walkera Talki H in disguise proprietary s batteries limit if real usefulness with slow flight times. Beyond that the construction is perfect for its designed use and their leash system ourperforms anyone else for durability and ease of use for those who really want a dedicated to following them drone. And at mph capable of mph winds it will perform for most activities well during those  minutes. ,UAVDrones,cnhcclf,1,t5_2vvfq
