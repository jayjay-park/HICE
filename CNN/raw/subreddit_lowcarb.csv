4139926,0,t3_383ghz,It depends on what makes you feel good. I personally no longer go lowcarb because it adversely affected my workouts. I still eat them in moderation but bringing them back into my diet in the form of complex carbs that are always paired with a fat and protein have really done wonders for me. ,lowcarb,crs641d,1,t5_2rlo3
4320410,0,t1_csasqnd,Ive had the same question as OP. I dont think they mean going back to eating however many carbs they can eat in a day but upping carbs to a maintenence level instead of a level that will cause them to lose weight. ,lowcarb,cscn0yh,1,t5_2rlo3

8754373,0,t1_d6zvkrw,Sometimes I add healthy starches like sweet potatoe or white rice. Small amounts but enough to get my carb count up there. I didnt see a difference. Im also afraid to do more because my body is so sensitive to it. One thing with a lot of carbs such as bread or sugar will immediately affect my blood sugar and then I feel like Im going to pass out for the rest of the day. Maybe I should have more white rice and see how that goes? I havent noticed it affecting me yet except for making me tired. ,lowcarb,d6zyd5w,1,t5_2rlo3
