635811,0,t3_210x26,Depends how you lay it out I have a skills based CV so have sections for training management and I have an IT bit at the end. In the IT bit I put I am comfortable with all MS Office software and have an intererest in technology cryptocurrency and online gaming  that tells them Im a geek and will be good with all IT issues but without listing everything. I sometimes put the software Ive used as well so that bullet point will read I have used many bespoke and industryspecific IT packages such as SAP Kerridge Maximo  although to be fair thats from my previous job history. ,UKJobs,cgcjiwo,1,t5_2seb3

1636526,0,t3_2d2mlg,Lie.Edit to clarify create believable scenarios that can be used as examples in the STAR method interview. The examples dont need to relate to a paid job.Its a shame that the UK interview practice promotes the peter principle. It is because of this that you get people with no ability job surfing their way up the career ladder. ,UKJobs,cjlg67u,3,t5_2seb3

You might want to keep the lab skills for lab based jobs though. I dont really know enough about your specialisation to know if theyre relevant. Having key resp. and projects is too much merge them too. For your current role have the KR as point one point two should be project manager for x project managing xy z saving xK or whatever,UKJobs,csraumd,1,t5_2seb3

5644984,0,t3_3sf29q,You dont need to get graduate jobs you only need to land one job. Be strong and keep going.This post is about focusing on graduate recruitment since it seems a lot of the places youre looking are advertising open positions requiring people with experience.Assume that every employer of any size has a graduate scheme or at least likes to take on fresh graduates. That means every financial institution every retail operation every business on the FTSE  every large public department big charities and quangos potentially any sufficiently forwardlooking company with say  employees of which there are thousandsThis changes the problem youre working to solve. Instead of finding and matching the advertised position that suits you best its all about discovering and contacting enough places to hit a winner. This problem can be attacked with the Internet and a telephone plus persistence and a lovely enormous spreadsheet to track your progress. Hard work and timeconsuming but you have the time right?,UKJobs,cwwtcav,4,t5_2seb3
6428651,0,t1_czk7cr7,I wouldnt mention it on a CV mate just list the years you were at the your place of work. Its up to the employer to bring it up if at all  if they dont during an interview that could be a bad sign I suppose so you could mention that you were made redundant due to financial hardship that the company was going through.

8615290,0,t1_d6i6p7s,As someone who was in your position a few months ago I was an unemployed  year old ex poker player with a degree in Computer Vis amp Animation. Ive since landed a job as a runner using a brand new showreel at a huge VFX company in Soho mostly by sending a direct mail to the head of recruitment explaing my situation and related experience after  months of unemployment. Got a reply within minutes and a new job within  hours of sending. My advice? Look for the foot in the door roles and find the emails of the people in charge of hiring for them. Thats the best advice i could give myself  months ago.  is never too late! I have guys doing the same job as me at  years of age with zero insecurities. Google is your best ally. ,UKJobs,d6iice6,4,t5_2seb3
9072583,0,t1_d81j11e,Engineer tends to apply to people who have done degrees and higher qualifications like HNCs rather than unskilled or technician type which are different in their own respect.,UKJobs,d82dlbz,2,t5_2seb3
9707682,0,t3_5e4hfp,Not really no. Many people may want to move to a different part of the country and have the means to do so therefore wouldnt be disqualified from a potential interview. There were however times where a candidate would apply for a job I was recruiting for and they were on the other side of the country. If they were qualified for the job I would call them for a telephone interview and discuss their plans for relocation. Sometimes candidates have blanket applied for roles and havent even realised that theyve applied for a role so far from home  then make their apologies  then pay a bit more attention when applying for other roles. If you suspect that youre not being considered for a role because youre from a place that has a notoriously bad reputation you can ask their HR Department as to why you didnt receive an interview.If they say its because of where you live then it opens up a communication line which will allow you to manage their concerns. If they point blank refuse to hire you and cite your location as the reason despite your willingness to move within reasonable distance of the role then you can look at pursuing action against the company but it would likely go nowhere. ,UKJobs,da9ohrl,4,t5_2seb3
