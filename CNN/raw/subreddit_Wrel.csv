2222960,0,t3_2k6oq5,Hi Wrel In the upcoming interview I would like it if you mentioned the balance issues currently between the factions MBTs when speaking to Kevmo. The MBT in particular that should be addressed is the Vanguard I remember a while back both Higby and Kevmo said that they would address the Vanguard shield so that it wouldnt be a crutchskilless ability. I am not sure where you stand on the issue but please hear me out.The situation in question includes the time Higby and Kevmo asked the community to join them on PTS and have a huge three way tank battle. In the comments section after the battle the Vanguard and its shield was brought up and people were expecting exciting changes and additions. They didnt really change the mechanics of the shield at all however but only reduced the health.To balance the tank I would suggest that the Vanguard gets a buff to increase its top speed and its ability to turn while moving at its top speed this way it wouldnt lose a lot of speed when chasing. To counterbalance this the shield should be replaced with a resist type shield. This would mitigate damage as opposed to blocking it altogether. Many people who play tanks are sick of this skilless ability and know that its broken in AV MBT battles.To supplement my suggestion here are some commentsthreads on the issueVanguard My comments on engaging a Vanguard as a Prowler and just how strong the Vanguard is in AV situations.Vanguard Comment made which considers that the tanks arent balanced as one is an HBT and the others are MBTs. I would like to add in adittion to this comment an analogy that can be found in game. The PPA is being balanced as it was able to comfortably engage targets at long range something that the other two ES AI vehicle weapons were not able to do. The whole point of faction balance and diversity is to give factions similarly specific weapons for specific type of engagements but to create noticeable and fun differences to immerse yourself in a world with three unique factions. The PPA is being nerfed because it performs too well at range where the other factions weapons have no chance of operating.A similar comment could be made about the ES tanks. The Vanguard is a HBT not an MBT like the other factions. Why didnt SOE give players all MBTs or all HBTs and then give each faction their own specific flair through abilities and slight tweaks?. Having one faction have an HBT and the other factions have MBTs is not balanced just as much as the PPA isnt balanced as it performs differently and creates a completely different role and mechanic that isnt given to the other two factions.To be succinct you could view the situations as so. ES Tanks.Vangaurd  HBT and the Magrider and Prowler  MBT different roles not balanced. AI ES weapons.PPA  Long range infantry weapons and the Cannister and Marauder  Close range weapons different roles not balanced.Also as an addition to MBTs is an issue that I care for less than MBT balance but is nonetheless important. This issue is being spotted and the duration of the spot timer when running full stealth.Stealth Why should a fully stealth vehicle be Q spotted for the full  seconds like a vehicle without stealth? There should be a reduction in spotted time to make stealth more viable,Wrel,clme3or,1,t5_32ike
