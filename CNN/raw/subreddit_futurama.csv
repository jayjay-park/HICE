Even the Florida Panhandle reported up to  inches cm with hurricaneforce wind gusts and record low barometric pressures. Between Louisiana and Cuba hurricaneforce winds produced high storm surges across northwestern Florida which along with scattered tornadoes killed dozens of people. Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the South and East in the wake of this storm. In the United States the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to over million customers.

3190230,0,t3_2wo0cm,I was hoping there would be a service call that retrieved the quote.  Sadly the quotes have been hardcoded into a JavaScript array.   Heres all of them  Thats a chick show. I prefer programs of the genre Worlds Blankiest Blank.  But existing is basically all I do!  Were in the middle of nowhere which is the safest part of nowhere.  Wait a second. I know that monkey! His name is Donkey.  All right its Saturday night. I have no date a two liter bottle of Shasta and my allRush mix tape. Lets rock!  I didnt ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy!  I did do the nasty in the pasty  Im not rich but Im comfortable  Leela lets turn back. There is absolutely no shame in wussing out.   Dont you worry about Planet Express let me worry about blank.   Hey wait. Im having one of those things. You know a headache with pictures.  Finally Im as rich as the pope!  Its like a party in my mouth and everyones throwing up.  The lizards..no the parrot..no wait the lizards no yes no yes yes yes...the parrot!  I had more... but go ahead  There.  Now hes trapped in a book I wrote.  A crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors.  Oh. I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just didnt have the grades. Or the physical endurance.  Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.  Oh my God its the future. My parents my coworkers my girlfriend Ill never see any of them again. Yahoo!  Thinking hurts him maybe I can think of a way to use that  I just made out with that radiator woman from the Radiator Planet!  Theyre like sex except Im having them!  Alright bird you thought you could beat me in a game of wits. Well you just met your equal.  Hey you have no right to criticize the th century! We gave the world the light bulb the steam boat and the cotton gin.  The Breakfast Club soundtrack. I cant wait until Im old enough to feel ways about stuff.  In my time we didnt depend on hitech gadgets like you do we didnt need a mechanical washing unit to wash our clothes we just used a washing machine  The important thing is were all together for Xmas. And even though Im surrounded by robots and monsters and old people Ive never felt more at home.  I never thought it would end this way.. gunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly I didnt see it coming.  Michelle I dont regret this but I both rue and lament it.  Things are different this time. Before she was demanding and possessive but now she wants me to do stuff and stay with her all the time.  Ive been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I the pope?  Make up some feelings and tell her you have them.  My God! What if the secret ingredient is people?  Take that one and that one. This sentence I donampt understand but take this one.  Hey what smells like blue?  Okok Ill take the  lizards. No wait yes no yes Yes yes! THE PARROT  Youre a bender right we can get outta here all you have to do is bend the bars!  Who cares what youre programmed for? If someone programmed you to jump off a cliff would you do it?  Wow you got that off the internet! In my day the internet was only used to download pornography.  Oh crud I always thought by this point Id be the one making the crank calls.  Wow theres a million aliens Ive never seen anything so mind blowing.. Oh a reception table with muffins!  Wow Bender are you and the ship an item? I mean I know youre both items but how can you date a ship anyway? Itd be like me dating a really fat lady and living inside her and shed be all like nauweddwissiso  Wow letters like u and r can mean words like you and are! Here Leela u r  cute  I love you too conventional Youre my man Oh so close.  Maybe we hit a space cow.  Space. It seems to go on and on forever. But then you get to the end and the gorilla starts throwing barrels at you.  Pizza delivery for.. I. C. Wiener! Oh crud! I always thought at this point in my life Id be the one making the crank calls!  Whats with the eye?  Wait! Youre the only friend I have!  This is awesome!! Are we gonna fly through space fighting monsters and teaching alien women to love?   Ah just like my Dad used to make until McDonalds fired him.  Sure I just like TV better.  How could they even know about a show from  years ago?  Ow! My sperm!  Wait a second. Im getting an idea. No false alarm. No. Yes! No. Yep. Nope wait no. Yes. Yes. No. YES!!!!  Thats not soon enough!  Its just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper kept burying acorns for the winter while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came and the grasshopper died and the octopus ate all his acorns. And also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?  Valentines Days coming. I forgot to get a girlfriend again! Well since neither of us has a date why dont we..  Everything was going great until she started talking about hanging out. Hanging out?! Shes getting way too serious Im not a onewoman man Leela.  Geez were already planning to spend Valentines Day together isnt that enough?  Oh so all of a sudden were spending Valentines Day together?  If I ever want to go back to the year  Ill just freeze myself again.  Hey my girlfriend had one of those. Actually it wasnt hers it was her Dads. And actually she wasnt my girlfriend she just lived next door and never closed the curtains.  You mean Bender is the evil Bender? Im shocked shocked well not that shocked.  The moon? The moon moon? Wow! Im gonna be a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong and those other brave guys no one ever heard of!  I dont care how educational it is. Lets do it!   I never told anybody this but a thousand years ago I used to look up at the moon and dream about being an astronaut. I just never had the grades. Nor the physical endurance. Plus I threw up a lot and nobody liked spending a week with me.   Im sorry. I was up really late poking through peoples desks.  Man its a total sty! For the first time in a thousand years I feel like Im home!   Dont girl me with that girl stuff. Bender and me are guys. Guys dont have feelings.   I heard that one time you single handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something something system.   Wait Mount Rushmore and The Leaning Tower of Piza. I didnt know they were both in New York.  I cant work under these conditions! Without me there is no mission I am the mission!  Im real sorry I missed the mission. I wasnt there and you might have needed me.  Aw Nibbler at least Im important to you even if its only because I clean up your poop.  Are you my mommy?  Sorry what? I wasnt paying attention.  Im at the input console. Im a little nervous and Ive got brain in my butt crack.  You little runts froze me you took away my life!  No you cant shut your adorable trap!  But it was my life!   Of course not I love the future.  You really think I would have had a chance with Leela?  Oh thanks. If you ever need a savior again just ask!  Ill be whatever I wanna do!  Did everything just taste purple for a second?  Then I am the most important person in the universe.  He wasnt an astronaut he was a sitcom actor. And he was only using space travel as a metaphor for beating his wife.  Well first everything went dark. Then this bright light appeared and it said Game Over.  So Leela do you wanna be like us? Or do you wanna be like Adelai with no severe mental or social problems whatsoever?  Hey Im beginning to think you guys dont think Im very smart.   But but Bender need brain... for smart making.   I dont like you  This is nothing. Back in high school I used to drink a hundred cans of cola a week. Yep right up until my third heart attack.   Swish!  You know what I like about you Umbriel you find me fascinating even when Im not pretending to be a jewel thief or a lion tamer.  At last. War has made me into a man. Weeeeee!  Its ok Bender theres no such thing as two.  Im never gonna get used to the st century. Caffeinated bacon? Baconated grapefruit? Admiral Crunch?  Shut the hell up!  Bender Look! Its That Guy You Are!  Thats the saltiest thing Ive ever tasted. And I once ate a big heaping bowl of salt!   No Im... doesnt.  I understood the word hat!  Im walking on sunshine.  You cant give up Professor you just have to try even harder. Is any of this getting through to you? Oh I give up.  Go gather your nuts you nagging grasshopper.  Yeah. We call them LandSeaLions.  I tame them.  Why am I sticky did I fall asleep on the ground at the movie theater again?  Bender! Bender! Have you seen my sombrero?  So Leela how about a romantic ride in one of those swan boats? Theyre kind of dangerous but Ive finally mastered them.  Wait a minute I know whats going on here. Youve all become idiots.   She does too have meat shes loaded with meat she has more meat that a cow.  Thanks. Theyre called pants.  Maybe he likes it here in hell.  Fancy cigar. Why dont you smoke it already? Puff puff go go go go go!  My ass has blisters from the slide!  Just two robots out roboting it up.  I wouldnt wanna be me right now  The side that kicks your twisted metal ass.  I dont like disks crammed into me unless theyre Oreos and then only in the mouth.  ,futurama,coso10c,18,t5_2qhqw

Zoidberg is of mating age and could be only one or two generations removed from the date of anchovy extinction.

4391679,0,t1_csknq5c,Here is the article in questionQ There are some significant differences in your beliefs. For instance dont Mormons believe that God was once a man?A I wouldnt say that. There was a little couplet coined As man is God once was. As God is man may become. Now thats more of a couplet than anything else. That gets into some pretty deep theology that we dont know very much about.Q So youre saying the church is still struggling to understand this?A Well as God is man may become. We believe in eternal progression. Very strongly. We believe that the glory of God is intelligence and whatever principle of intelligence we attain unto in this life it will rise with us in the Resurrection. Knowledge learning is an eternal thing. And for that reason we stress education. Were trying to do all we can to make of our people the ablest best brightest people that we can.Q Just another related question that comes up is the statements in the King Follet discourse by the Prophet.A Yeah.Q  about that God the Father was once a man as we were. This is something that Christian writers are always addressing. Is this the teaching of the church today that God the Father was once a man like we are?A I dont know that we teach it. I dont know that we emphasize it. I havent heard it discussed for a long time in public discourse. I dont know. I dont know all the circumstances under which that statement was made. I understand the philosophical background behind it. But I dont know a lot about it and I dont know that others know a lot about it.He said I dont know which is the right answer because there is a lot that we dont know. As God is man may become. We believe in eternal progression. Knowing whether God was a man or whether polygamy is an eternal principal is not vital to our salvation.,futurama,cskof4m,1,t5_2qhqw

5896314,0,t1_cxsiqwf,A good buddy of mines brother had died last year and he used to be big Powerlifter. I not having kids and pretty involved in lifting decided to build a gym in my garage for him to start lifting again. My other friends joined in and now we all lift together several times a week and have Strongman Sundays where about  of us lift then grill and hang out. One of the best things I feel Ive ever done to keep our group together. Sadly his father passed two weeks ago and the night he passed I awoke to the sound of banging in my garage. I went in and he was deadlifting to the point his hands were bleeding. I walked over and put my hand on his shoulder and told him I was sorry. He told me this was the better alternative to taking his own life. We moved onto Squat and talked about it and hes fine now. ,futurama,cxsjhe6,2,t5_2qhqw

Ive always been a huge Simpsons fan since I was a kid. Some of my earliest memories were watching Star Trek TNG and Simpsons with my dad. Futurama was the perfect fit.I loved how varied the show was. It had an endearing cast of characters that while majority of the show is just ridiculous adventures. They hit on some relatable themes. Things that really hit home. Seymour Frys mom Farnsworths parents the holophone recital and so many others. I wasnt prepared for the emotional rollercoaster it put me through but I cant wait to go around again. ,futurama,df4c8z3,32,t5_2qhqw
