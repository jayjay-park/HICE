1465197,0,t3_2aybgm,Looking through this album I cant help but think of the legendary Steve McQueen movie Le Mans that featured an epic battle between Porsche and Ferrari where McQueen spoke the famous linegt Racing is life. Anything that happens before or after is just waiting.It wasnt the M in the movie but its closely related predecessor in the S that was featured instead. The story with these cars is really pretty interesting  due to rule changes in  that said Group  race cars would then have a limit of .liters on the engine. That really threw a spanner in the works at Ferrari rendering their .liter V racer redundant for that season. They sat it out  and studied their competitors and the rule book closely to try and find a solution. They soon found their way back in with a loophole in FIA rules that said if  examples of a car were built they would be eligible for entry into the Group  Sports Car category with their S. So like Porsche did with their  Ferrari built  examples of the car so they could go racing again. Sounds easy enough right? It was actually incredibly expensive to complete that task and Enzo didnt have anywhere near enough cash to do it alone  but he was desperate to keep racing. He sold half of his company to Fiat to bankroll the build of  cars. Compared to the aircooled flat of the  the S was a mess of cooling pipes and a huge radiator and carried a kg weight disadvantage to the Porsche. Although considered equally as fast as the  they suffered reliability problems and Porsche won  out of the  races in the  season. Only some spectacular driving by Mario Andretti absolutely determined to not be beaten by some flashy movie star stole the  hour endurance race at Sebring from Steve McQueen and Peter Revson in their Porsche  by just seconds.The M then  the M stands for monster by the way no no it actually stands for modificato  as this were essentially  S cars that went on a lb diet and found another hp to be able to produce a mighty hp at rpm. Straight away the car was setting a furious pace on the track lapping faster than the s qualifying time with full tanks in the opening laps of its first race. The development gap had finally been closed and the playing field leveled. Only around  cars from this stretch still survive today four still as the S and a dozen in full M specification. To end lets take a few minutes to watch a little track footage to get a feel for the experience of controlling one of these sensational cars.Photography courtesy of Don Heiny.,thewholecar,cizxs0t,9,t5_311zb

1550412,0,t3_2c0331,What source could be better than the company themselves?Ultima is a small British company dedicated exclusively to making high performance cars. The company was founded in  by Ted and Richard Marlow although the Ultima Mk and Mk were products of Noble Motorsport so basically these guys worked with Noble and then decided in  to buy the rights to the car and then started their own company.Its hard to say much about this car because it is designed to be built by its owner somewhat like the Caterham that the Top Gear presenters built. Anyway because of that every GTR is a little bit different especially considering that the engine is not included with the car although I think that they have one that you can buy with the chassis.Although the car was meant to be built by its owner Ultima also offers a prebuilt model if Im reading the website correctly. The car is meant to be used with a Chevrolet V with power outputs ranging from  hp to  hp.Ultima touts one of the models they themselves built as the fastest roadgoing car ever. Referring not to raw straight line speed the companys claims are supported by the cars record holding . seconds from . The companys car also did  in . seconds which is among the top ten times in the world.You wont go faster for your money and I like the utilitarianism of the car. Usually utility cars are just utilities to go from point A to B. This is a utility in a different sense a tool to go fast.

I love them just a small secluded space a tiny engine and absolutely nothing unnecessary.This great threewheeler originated in Germany by a company called Heinkel Flugzeugwerke which loosely translates to Heinkel aircraft factory. Thats probably the reason why it looks like they just chopped the top of an airplane and put some wheels on it.They used a  cc singlecylinder fourstroke engine from one of their scooters  It produced a measly  bhp but the car only weighted kg  lbs! Not exactly a sports car then but its got a top speed of  kmh which is still pretty good for a car the size of a basketball.Unfortunately? modern safety regulations make it impossible to make cars like this because it would be great to see cars like this drive around today. I think in  years when most cars will be completely deathproof people will look back at cars like these and think what the hell where they thinking?But I find it fascinating pure simplicity and functionality.Photography courtesy of RMauctions,thewholecar,cl99kij,10,t5_311zb

Wheelbase . in. Radical advanced design by Marcello Gandini Attractive largely unrestored example Production version of the threetime World Rally Championship sensationIf there was ever an automobile that turned the rally world upsidedown it was the Lancia Stratos HF. The first automobile purposely built for competition in the World Rally Championships the Stratos powerful radical design looked like nothing else on the road. Standing just over three and a half feet tall a Stratos blasting through a European rally circuit was truly an impressive sight. Even more so when considering that it is probably one of the only Ferraripowered cars regularly seen covered in mud. The first time the Stratos name was introduced to the public was in  at the Turin Motor Show as a concept car named the Lancia Stratos Zero displayed on Bertones stand. This sensational conception captured the heart of Cesare Fiorio manager of Lancias World Rally Championship team. The following year when Lancia introduced a prototype designed by Marcello Gandini of Bertone called the Stratos HF Fiorio encouraged Lancia to campaign the Stratos in rallying.Lancias earliest prototypes were powered by engines from both the Lancia Fulvia and Beta road cars but they ended up using Ferraris midmounted V first seen in the Dino . Bertone manufactured the Stratos in Turin and sent the cars to Lancias nearby Chivasso factory for final assembly. With an incredibly short wheelbase a curb weight of just under  pounds and a  time of less than five seconds the Stratos was incredibly quick and quite maneuverable. Coupled with a wraparound windshield that provides fantastic front visibility an experienced driver could easily and precisely place the Stratos anywhere on the road. The Stratos was the perfect tool to dominate international rally competition and dominate it did. Beginning its racing career in  the Stratos was campaigned as a prototype by the Lancia team. Success did not come immediately and the Stratos finally earned its first win in . By  Lancia and its Stratos were on their way to supremacy in Group  rallying. Entry into that years round of the World Rally Championship required the production of  roadlegal units. Production started in  however by  only  were completed because the Group  production requirement for the World Rally Championship was dropped to  units. A winwin situation for Lancia as homologation made the Stratos available to its clambering fans at the height of its success and increased interest in the Lancia brand worldwide.Regardless of claiming an unprecedented three World Rally Championship titles in a row  through  internal squabbling had divided the Fiat group and its racing enterprises. As a result Fiat removed the Stratos from formal factorybacked competition and replaced it with the Fiat  Abarth. Many Stratos enthusiasts believe that if Lancia was permitted to keep racing the Stratos the car would have continued to dominate the series likely winning even more World Championships as its design and specification were so far advanced over contemporary competitors.After its formal reign of factory supremacy was over the Stratos proved to be successful in the hands of privateers even winning the Monte Carlo Rally in . Several Stratoses beat newer cars campaigned by Fiat and Lancia a testament to its engineering prowess. Lancia built a pair of turbocharged Stratoses for rally use as well but alas they were not nearly as successful as the Fiat  or their naturally aspirated predecessors.

Renaults considerable Fderived turbocharging expertise was applied to the humble .litre overheadvalve engine resulting in a power increase to bhp in road trim an output sufficient for a top speed of mph and a  time of under seven seconds. In the Turbo this remarkable little engine was mounted amidships where the rear passenger seats had been and drove the rear wheels via a fivespeed transaxle.A thinly disguised twoseater supercar the Turbo was first seen in prototype form at the  Paris Salon and made its competition debut in  on the Tour de Corse Jean Ragnotis bhp works car leading the event before succumbing to electrical trouble. In  RagnottiAndrie won the Monte Carlo Rally outright for Renault and the following year Ragnotti won the Tour de Corse again. Faced with increasing competition from teams running fourwheel drive cars Renault responded with more powerful  Tour de Corse and  Maxi Turbo variants Ragnotti adding another Tour de Corse win in the latter in . At the end of the season the works team retired the  Turbo from competition. Had Renault chosen to contest a full international programme with the  Turbo rather than concentrating on French national events then its record at the highest level would surely have been even more impressive.I  would like  to start a new trend rating the car from  to  with an anonymous poll.

Designer studios wants very thin lights that follows the curve of the car. Problem is halogen and xenon are not compact enough. Led will replace all those also less expensive easier to manufacture . As for right now xenon are still the best option but not in a reflector housing go projector atleast . Thick optics for high end cars. Also in terms of output all of these system are limited by light scatering since ece and sae standard requires minimal light flooding. The challenge here is to direct precisely high outputs of lights while agreeing with both minimal standard max standard the design studio while also having the economic constraint.  Edit Saw after the term optics in the first question Look out for three things  light pipes but ford already have those on the f  stardust optics they will look like jewels and precious rocks in the lamp hard to explain not my cup of tea but a luxury brand already bought an insert  and finally light curtains  I think volvo already released those  they use a microcone technology in the molding process to redirect light crazy stuff. ,thewholecar,d0j0l7j,7,t5_311zb
