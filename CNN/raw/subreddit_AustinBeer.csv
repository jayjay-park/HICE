3897086,0,t3_35352n,From gt We are pleased to announce that our lawsuit with New Belgium Brewing is finally behind us. The judge dismissed it and agreed that the jurisdiction of Colorado was not appropriate. New Belgium claimed that our attendance at GABF satisfied minimum contact which was absurd and very costly to defend. Rest assured small brewers of America you CAN participate in the Great American Beer Fest without falling under the long arm of Colorado law or violating the laws of interstate commerce created by your respective States beer distribution governance. NBB continues to say that we do not want to settle. This remains untrue. We have made multiple offers even traveled to meet with them in Denver however they wont send anyone with the authority to make a settlement decision and reject all of our offers.I really wish they would disclose what settlement terms they offered that were rejected.  It is impossible to know who is being an asshat here without knowing what demands are being made by whom.,AustinBeer,cr0i2ue,6,t5_2t7c9
