1897059,0,t3_2gaqwq,Hi and welcome to Grim Dawn!  I can see  reasons for the moment    The game has not a lot of dedicated players yet. This is a small game!   There is currently no way to prevent cheating which spoils the fun. So people prefer playing with other people they know to prevent that.    The first point hoppefully will change with time. But for the second it may be a persistent matter.    That being said I dont think you should ditch this great game  try to convince a friend to play it and play together   ,Grimdawn,ckhsaxy,2,t5_2s6i9

6118444,0,t3_3zcq37,I believe you generally want to focus on at most  maybe  damage types. Any can go together provided you have the right mastery combo. For example Soldier wont contribute much to a Cold build. I think Bleeding and Chaos are the biggest ones that run into resistance problems maybe Vitality too?You dont need Cunning for accuracy. You can get Offensive Ability from weaponskillDevotion bonuses which will also increase your accuracy. In fact Cunning just boosts your OA getting it on gear goes straight to the source.I use components pretty aggressively in the early game but you dont necessarily need to. That said Im not sure you gain much from hoarding your Platings etc. early on.,Grimdawn,cyl3qpw,3,t5_2s6i9
6121236,0,t3_3zaqj3,Consider removing points from the Dual Blades line Dual Blades Belgothians Shears etc and putting more into Soldier.Much of Blademasters AoE is in procs. The only reliable source early on is Cadence gt Fighting Form and Blitz. The latter you should aim for just as a gap closer alone Shadow Strike deals more damage but Blitz has knockback.Cadence even with one point and the onhit procs of Nightblade Cadence does not stack with these when Cadence procs itll override them its still a decent choice. Barring this you are far enough into Nightblade to pump points into Ring of Steel Ring of Frost is good too for CC.Physique is not necessary there are players who have gone through Ultimate without it but I wouldnt suggest it. If youre just going for PhysicalPierce try for a  ratio of PhysiqueCunning.My personal recommendation.Note that Steps of Torment is even after Bs level adjustment largely designed for higher level characters with decent gear. Try to be level  before you tackle it because even if you can clear the packs youll potentially get wiped by the final boss my problem currently.Look for Aether resist.,Grimdawn,cylf5z9,1,t5_2s6i9

6281795,0,t3_41n2j0,Both are viable Blademaster the NightbladeSoldier combo is very gear dependent and focuses fairly hard on a few stat stick type abilities while Spellblade is pretty focused on active activity with more hit and run tactics and abuse of your two invunerability skills to avoid being where the damage can hit you in the first place or if you cant do that just flat out negate  of the damage for  seconds on top of the mad NB heals.As far as I know just about every class combo is viable although with varying degrees of difficulty.  A far bigger part is the Devotions which matter a ton and have so many bonuses which can easily add up to rd of your stats it not more.Just as a rule of thumb just about all classes can use the top parts of the Arcanist tree as well as the passives on the bottom ,Grimdawn,cz3o4cz,1,t5_2s6i9

Is it spammable? And do you have any idea how the stats stacking works. Is there diminishing return andor how much it is? For example what will happen with the Elemental Resistance Reduction if I use Curse of Frailty AND Unmake skill from the Tome of Names? Is it going  most probably not?

There are also  epics in the level  range that enable dual pistol using Marauders Belt Marauders Gloves and Brigand Jacket IIRC cant remember that last ones name exactly but it is a level  epic unlike the other two which are s and part of a set.  Just a warning swapping to dual pistols will KILL your energy pool because Firestrike drains per shot and with dual pistols you are attacking about  times as often.  That is why you probably will want to max out IEE by level  at least just so you can use the  energy leech per attack to negate the worst of it.Due to how it works you will generate energy faintly on attack with maxed IEE but if you miss you will quickly oom.   I mean at least you can negate the worst of it and you can even game IEEs energy leech by attacking waiting a sec and attacking again after waiting out the leech effect or rapidly switching targets but those mean you are not killing targets nearly as fast.,Grimdawn,czm1cu7,1,t5_2s6i9

6725631,0,t1_d0evrf2,Thats a really good question but really difficult to come up with a logical answer. The short answer is that in general while leveling I dont worry about defenses unless Im having trouble surviving. If youre killing fast and not being killed youre doing fine.Taking your example Id take the gloves with  armor and  health. The reason is that armor if kept updated in all slots makes the damage you receive less spiky as long as youre not getting crit a lot and health is also a known reliable defense. The lower armor means youll take more damage if you get hit on your hands and the  DA means that you wont get hit as often but  might not be very much while youre low level. Id hover over your Defensive score to see how much your chance to be hitcrit changes when you swap in DA item.For weapons that depends on if youre a pure caster or actually using your weapon for damage. If youre a caster just look at which weapon is improving your skills the most adds some defenses you rely on or other stats that help your build. For weaponusers attack speed is often the most important because it adds your flat damage more frequently and increases the number of skill procs. Speaking of skill procs a weapon with a skill on it is also very nice. Many times a weapon with high attack speed will still be preferable to one  levels higher because of this. Other than speed and skills attack damage converted to health and straight up damage are great things to get.,Grimdawn,d0ezlqz,1,t5_2s6i9

Thanks to the mastery and devotion system you can specialize.The world is MUCH bigger than D where the story mode is useless after all you just play Bounties Rifts and Grifts and grind for crafting stuff to gamble and enchant your items.Grim Dawn really shines because of the atmosphere and the huge variety of builds.Diablo  is fast pathed with focus on playergroups to progress while GD is slower a great singleplayer experience with the option to play with friends as well.GD offers exploration secret areas and that try and error experience that Diablo  had back in the day.While I like Diablo  for its fast easy and smooth action it is all about Torment X Grind and GRfit maxing.Grim Dawn has more immersion for me it is an oldschool ARPG with nice additional stuff crafting grinding individualisation where I have to work to progress in veteran mode.D is brain afk fast pathed farming where you grind nonstop bounties and rifts and uber bosses to break certain Grift levels and maybe even compete in the ladder.It is great for  player action and killing masses of monsters.Grim Dawn is a backtotheroots Solo play Grinder with an amazin atmosphere immersion a huge bestiarium LARGE handcrafted levels and so much to explore while you combine  masteries with an extra layer called devotion system.It is slow paced complex and demanding  if you want.D is more casual nice to play some rounds with buddies or random pubbies  and I like it for that.Grim Dawn is more oldschool and hardcore grind in some areas  and I love it for that.Well this is a wall of text sorryDBut to sell you finally on GD  I will copy and paste a post from user Kaljurei of the MMO Champion forum as it covers everything I would write now as wellgt The game is spread across  acts but the developers have repeatedly stated that they do not actually use this terminology and the game is intended to be one complete adventure starting from Devils Crossing until the Necropolis.gt You start off with one Mastery such as Soldier Arcanist etc and can choose a secondary Mastery at level . Choosing the secondary Mastery is entirely optional but current balance dictates that single Mastery setups are at a major disadvantage to dual Mastery setups.gt There are a variety of builds for each Mastery and Masteries can be combined to make several builds. Want to make a Melee H Physical damage spec? Go Soldier and Shaman to make a H Savagery auto attack build or Cadence or Blade Arc etc. Want to make a DW PiercePhysical damage spec? Go Soldier and Nightblade to make use of Nightblade DW skills and synergize with physicalpierce and attack speed boosts from Soldier.Basically one Mastery provides the attacks and the other provides synergy and utility as stated in the examples above.gt Almost every weapon can be used in several builds. RiflesPistols are used in PhysicalPierceFireLightningChaos builds. H AxesSwordsMaces are used in Nightblade builds. Scepters are used in Caster builds etc.gt There are  main stats  Physique which boosts HP HP Regen etc. Cunning which boosts Pierce Damage Offensive AdvantageSort of like Hit and Crit chance. Spirit boosts Energy Energy regen and magical damage. Stats are sort of imbalanced now as Physique is highly prioritized to survive Ultimate but Cunning and Spirit are still extremely powerful.gt Yes Grim Dawn is a very linear quest dependent game but there are loads of side quests which involve exploring nonmandatory areas killing bosses making moral decisions which have an impact later on etc.gt The lore isnt very rich. The game is set in a time when humanity has been spent fighting major wars and then making mistakes which led to an Aetherial invasionTheyre spirit like creatures from another dimension and to a Chthonian invasionSort of like WoWs Old Gods to thwart the Aetherials. Theres also a lot of infighting human marauders preying on the populace a variety of beasts as well as undead armies inside doomed cities and catacombs. There are plenty of lore letters that drop to give you an idea of what happened and what is happening and even some tales that make you sort of cry and empathize with what happened in the world.gt Three main difficulties  Veteran Elite and Ultimate. Elite and Ultimate are significantly harder than their predecessors with resistance reductions increased enemy damage and health. Ultimate is much harder than Elite and requires both good gear and brains to take on the difficulty i.e the first miniboss can one shot you in Ultimate if youre not careful or didnt gear properly.gt The best part I feel about this game is that bugfixes updates and proper developerplayer discussions happen frequently i.e daily. The developers have a great sense of humour and have been in the gaming industry for more than a decade. The TQ engine is quite robust and can handle quite a lot of modification. Several players have already expressed an interest in modding and the developers are extremely supportive and will probably also be creating a modding software when the game is fully released.gt A variety of items ranging from Whites to Legendaries. Lower leveled Epics get an Empowered version at a higher level. Sets exist both as an Epic and Empowered Epic and Legendary variety and cater to several builds.gt Multiplayer is currently tuned only around  players and there are no dedicated servers. The devs have stated that if they have enough moneyabout a million dollars they will set up dedicated servers.Kaljurei also added Ive had a blast playing this game. Its also fairly cheap. The start may be a bit overwhelming but once you finish the first act i.e kill The Warden youll get a fairly good idea of the game.I can second that!,Grimdawn,d0fz051,4,t5_2s6i9

But in my right mind I cant agree with crafting being better. I think the problem comes with what we each consider good. Currency spamming is roughly equivalent to crafting in GD imo. Cross your finger and hope each mod turns out. But what sets path a bit apart is using master mods to steer your still random currency usage in the right direction. Or the ability to alt spam and use multimod to craft a pretty decent earlymid game gear.

6940217,0,t3_4aracf,It really depends on what youre doing most of your damage with.  If youre stacking tons of pierce modifiers then youre doing yourself a disservice by using weapons without it.  However if youre relying on a skill that has a big  weapon damage ability... then you might consider a slower weapon.As the dual wield Nightblade uses pierce and lots of weapon procs... you want to swing fast and often.  Your weapon damage is secondary to the amount of damage your procced skills are doing especially with something like the Mistborn Talisman on.  ,Grimdawn,d13047o,2,t5_2s6i9
6945985,0,t3_4au9cs,gtWhat is the most mobile class? I looked through abilities and didnt really see many abilities in the ways of kiting and moving quickly.Theres no single classes as such but theres masteries instead. Theres not a lot of mobilitybased skills but theres a few Charge ones that will help you do the opposite of kiting if you want.If you want mobility and kite itemization is more important. Youll want high movement or total speed and youll want to be using a twohanded ranged rifle and focus on slowdowns such as the Curse of Frailty used by the Occultist or the Flashbang of the Demolitionist or similar skills.gtAnd the second things is While looking through the abilities it seems to me like this game is mostly passives and auras with less emphasis on active abilities. Is this accurate?I wouldnt say so. Many Masteries do get a few passives and a few do get some auras but others get no auras at all and some dont get any pure passives at all aside from the ones that are upgrades or branches for active skills.Theres a lot of modularity to the system so if you want to have a lot of active skills you can and will have and youll do well but if you want to run very passively its extremely doable especially the Soldier gets a lot of passives to pick from.Based on my experiences with a lot of other ARPGs I actually end up using a lot more active skills than I usually am. For any build Ive played so far I can safely say that theres at least  skills I would consider core and use on a constant basis without counting passives auras pets or modals that you just turn on and then theyre on so practically passives.Dont forget that theres a lot of potential active skills and passives from items and Devotions and you shouldnt dismiss them. Its entirely possible to base your entire build around skills or abilities granted by devotions or items.,Grimdawn,d13np1o,1,t5_2s6i9

Simply dont deserve any more money off of me if you cannot make a game thats based off modern wantsPS Not a single person respond to this save your keystrokes this is aimed at the thread creator and if they want to pass on a serious but yet confronting question to the team of devs if not just ignore this post.,Grimdawn,d1f2b71,-13,t5_2s6i9

That is huge I hope I can make it to  eventually haha  I can already start to see the exp starting to get a bit slower after hitting level  last night. I actually made a new character after I got my first guy to level  when I first started on Friday evening and it made a huuuge difference going from Melee class to Ranged class. I think I like ranged more now but am still trying to figure out a good AoE skill that I can use for Elementalist in addition to Fire Strike.

7080524,0,t3_4cj0yk,GD doesnt do anything better than PoE except let you refund skill points which is admittedly really nice for theory crafting on the fly. You dont get locked in to a build and if it stops to work effectively you can tinker.Anyone who says the drops are balanced around being selffound has probably been playing since beta and has  characters all high level...starting fresh you really dont find blues for your character with any kind of consistency. The D drop system after AH went away is a much much better example of gear dropping for the character youre actually playing. I am halfway through Elite with a H Rifle pyro and I have found nothing for him but a ton of shit if I wanted to make a sword and board character or a H melee. I do not agree at all that the drops are well balanced in GD for solo play...unless you want to make one of every character type PThere is no end game in GD period. The multiplayer is terrible and rarely connects properly we havent managed it yet in the same damn house via LAN despite the game showing up in the available list...only game we cant just hop in together.Now...all that said...I like PoE more overall but I have played it so much D as well on both PC and PS that Grim Dawn is a nice break and really charming but I dont think it will grow and evolve the way PoE does.Give it a whirl but dont expect it to scratch all the itches that PoE does. PoE is king if you like loot trading and customization. GD is a fun game on its own merits though.,Grimdawn,d1ixxl4,3,t5_2s6i9

If you have a different resolution you can run AUSpy.exe in the AHK directory to get the general location of the skill. You could also have it search a wider area on the screen such as your whole skill bar or even the whole screen but I dunno what kind of impact on performance it would have.

But thats just for Fire Strike and Ive got tons of other damage coming from skill procs mostly Ulzuins Pyroclasm relic and Volcanic Wyrms Breath from Wyrmbone Handguards.Heres my skill build at level   including skills. Devotions may seem a little wonky I guess but I think Ive got a good mix of tankiness and damage. Will probably finish off the Fire Strike tree with remaining points but well see. I have a few points in BWC and Thermite Mine mostly for resist reduction but also because I like pressing more than one button haha plus the extra damage adds up. Olerons BloodEnchanted Flint in weapons so Ive got a nice singletarget nuke. And Im using a helmet Glory of the Silver Knight with another huge singletarget nuke on it. I may end up changing devotions around a bit once I get the last point still not positive that Ill be able to get away with the points in Spear of the Heavens but the extra OA is just so nice.As for your build if you dont mind the critique  Id say  in Flashbang is a bit overkill. Id go  or even  the  chance to miss on Searing Light is great and take those points elsewhere. Shadow Dance and Vindictive Flame the regen and total speed are super helpful are probably the top two choices based on the rest of your build. Given that this class will generally be lowish hp and since youre not using a shield and since we dont get a damage absorption skill dodge is pretty much vital. With PB on Ive got  meleeranged dodge after about  chance for enemies to miss. With certain pieces of gear you can get that up to . Also keep in mind that high DA will keep you from being crit which I think is pretty much essential to making the class work. ,Grimdawn,d1vos1o,1,t5_2s6i9

7715188,0,t1_d3iteci,Im not going to waste time reading your goddamn novel though I skimmed a few parts. But i would like to point out a couple things. When I said I wanted to experience the highest end content with relative ease I meant that I would like to experience it without excessive farming or trading because Im not playing the meta. You could do that in D you can do that in GD. You can play supposed bad skills in grim dawn and be successful in ultimate. I did with a trickster using wind Devils and blade spirits even though everyone says blade spirits are trash but I was able to make a build that works well without additional hours farming. Was that build less powerful than others? Yeah but the point was I was able to play the build I wanted to play and experienced the highest content with relative ease. And as far as trading not taking a long time I included farming for tradable goods in that hours of trading. Maybe I wasnt specific enough but I did mention that before you can even trade you need something of value.  exalts may be cheap but that still takes quite some time to get. Ive played probably  hours on PoE and Ive found exactly  exalt and I have found exactly zero items worth anywhere near an exalt. So even though halfway decent builds are cheap it still takes a tremendous amount of time to amass that level of wealth unless youre very lucky. So that leads me back to my original point that if you want to be successful in the end game youre very likely going to be using a handful of builds that are in the meta which limits your choices. That was my issue with D a couple years back. I dont know if its the same way since I havent played since then but everyone was basically playing the same couple builds for rifts and the skills I enjoyed playing were so subpar that I couldnt compete unless I followed the meta. I apologize for liking an ARPG in which I can play skills that are supposedly bad and be able to do content. Shit I did the same thing back in D with my frenzy barb. Everyone would say frenzy sucks WW is better! While WW was better I could still do solo runs for any boss in that game despite my build being supposedly bad. I dont have a problem with some builds outperforming others I know that will always be a thing but Im not a fan when some skills are so bad that you literally cannot play them in the endgame.,Grimdawn,d3j5x1t,1,t5_2s6i9

I started last week as well and what I did was get it to  and unlock my last  devotion point in ultimate and then I just farmed the Undead nemesis on elite. I manage to get every relic recipe in  days of just doing that with a ton of legendarys as well.Like all games of this genre the best way to get loot is to do the endgame content. Trying to hunt for specific items so early on around your level is really not worth it. I just used whatever dropped basically and just kept lvling.Also dont be fooled by what people say about Ultimate difficulty. Its not as hard as people make it out to be. If you played games like D and PoE you will do just fine. I would  say its like around gr for D and lvl  maps for PoE which is not difficult at all. You just need some decent resistance and pretty much you are good to go.One last thing This game seems to be more about making alts based on what legendary items you find.

8511947,0,t1_d63iutd,gt I might be wrong here but Im pretty sure you can skip nodes on the tree? Maybe I imagined it but Im pretty sure in the dual wielding tree I skipped one of the nodes and it still let me put points in further down. Not sure about that one.Hmmmm so you dont even know or understand how basic leveling in Gd works...You have to spend points in your class mastery The bottom line in the skilltree providing basestats  HP and mana to unlock the nodes further to the right. And yes you can skip nodes as you see fit as long as the bottoml ine up to the wanted node and the corresponding baseskill thats influenced by that node  is activated put at  least one point in. This means If you put the first  level ups  points? solely in your classmastery you can rush lategame skills right from the start.They dont unlock on their own as you level up you have to actively pursue them. How you do that is completely up to you. Skills are not bound to andor limited by player level. You NEED to push class mastery as early as you can  every other approach just gimps your character to almost unplayability resulting in oneshots from Heroes because you lack EVERYTHING to withstand them. You learned already that lightning damage is a bitch. It has an enormous damagerange and you got most likely crit. Only way to mitigate that is the Physique stat elementallightning resistance or Defensive Ability. You get plenty of everything but resistances via mastery alone. Resis come from your gear.Dont waste your early level ups in skills alone.You need no more than  points in any given skill you want to use to easily mow through all of  Veteran dificulty as long as your gear is up to date. So Dont push your individual skills too high early on just activate and adjust them if needed. The damage you do comes mainly from your gear so focus on that and  mastery first. You need the mana granted by it to use your skills once you try to max them out. Its no fun at all if you can use your AOE  or  times before your mana runs dry believe me... Grenado for example  is fucking expensive at  and oneshots most Veteran Heroes doing several THOUSAND excess damage thats just wasted. My character is level  atm.So you absolutely need to balance skills and mastery as equipable gear is dependant on your base stats. Skills alone wont boost them denying you later tiers of weaponry holding your character back immensly.There are no oneshotting enemies in Veteran mode. If there are its because you fucked your character up.

I have a higher focus in the Occultist tree though.My standard actions to take out mobs is to first throw Curse of Frailty on them which ignites them with Eldritch Fire from the Solaels Witchblade devotion.  This gives them a lot of reductions to their resistances and allows me to burn them down with my guns dual Exterminus.  I also use Mark of Solael to get Solaels Flame which also reduces resistances and does damage.

As such casting a debuffing ability with a high tick rate can beat out actual dps dealers very easily on aggro steal.  This is why pet builds tend to have the near  damage player still steal aggro from their high DPS pets fairly often.   This brings most support builds to utilize Demo for Blackwater Cocktail as a result.  It does ok damage with  massive debuffs  of which reduce enemy durability significantly for your other teammate to abuse the other two reducing their DPS against you.  You max Flashbang and Flametouched auras for increasing the effective OA of you and your team mate increasing dps.  If going with a physical heavy teammate also max Temper.Your second class after this is very heavily depending on your person you are supporting.  You want to pick whatever they are not excluding Nightblade that is a durable combo.   This means you will be either Soldier Occultist or Shaman second.  If soldier invest in durability  Squad tactics line.   If Occultist amp up CoFVulnerability and Blood of Dreeg.  If Shaman amp up Heart of the Wild and Wendigo Totems.You also have a few choices of devotions. You either will need to amp durability or damage for your team mate which means either Dying God Tree of Life or both to combo.,Grimdawn,dcavreg,6,t5_2s6i9
10300680,0,t1_dcbmaly,Yeah GD is great for that type of play since no quests disappear. Theres only two points in all the game where you get to pick between two different factions that decide which quests you have access to and that choice can be reset for each difficulty. So you can go with option A for both in Normal then go with option B in Epic before making your final choice in Ultimate. There are two sidequests I can think of as well that disappear if you progress the main storyline far enough but they only offer XP and no major things like attributes or skills. One character that you can meet in the swamps on your way to Burrwhich and one character in Devils Crossing that has a hidden sidequest that you can find a clue for on your way to Burrwhich. And again those things reset for the next difficulty so dont worry unless youve already reached Ultimate. ,Grimdawn,dcbmyzi,1,t5_2s6i9

10400564,0,t3_5oy6kp,Savagery does better singletarget damage.  This becomes more important the farther into the game you go.  One source of AoE is whatever lightning procs you find on items.  Another source is any lightning based Devotion proc.  Reckless Tempest is the obvious one.  Some people me like Elemental Storm.  Some people not me like Falcon Swoop even though its not lightning based because you can get it quickly and because its a useful prerequisite for other things.  Also get Arcane Bomb mainly for the resist reduction.  Feral Hunger and Upheaval also provide some AoE.Theres a neat trick of putting Reckless Tempest on Upheaval so that you get both procs every time you crit.  This only works with Savagery not Primal Strike.Devotions wouldnt be too different between the two skills.  Kraken and Hawk in addition to the others.  You can look at some different builds in the Build Compendium for different takes on the Devotion tree.,Grimdawn,dcmyyaw,5,t5_2s6i9

10454303,0,t3_5pqw1l,There is a lot of gear that will work for that build.  You dont need the specific pieces mentioned in the build.  Jajajas idea when he wrote the build was that the person playing it could get a more experienced player who does have the blueprints to craft the gear for them.  You can do much better than that gear one you get enough Legendaries.You could try Aspriant Crucible and see how you do there.I would farm an factions to Revered that arent already there.  Then I would work on farming to Nemesis in the others.I also think I would go through the factions and do all the bounties at least once.  Skipping the ones that require you to make a relic or fetch a rare crafting material.  Some of those are mildly interesting.Good farming runs are anything that has heroes and bosses.  So whatever you think is fun is probably good.  SoT is good.  If you cant do BoC then you probably have a hard time in Port Valbury too.  The run through Cronleys hideout all the way to the hive in Twin Falls is a good run.  The Dermapteran hive is still good.  Run Treasure Troves if you need blueprints.If you have decent AoE and clear speed you can kill everything.  Otherwise just run through and hit heroes and bosses.,Grimdawn,dct3kmq,3,t5_2s6i9

10619362,0,t1_ddba3ar,I usually end up with  point in most passives or toggleable buffsauras.  The existance of skills gear means you can get a lot out of a  point skill especially if its for utility.  If you decide its not really doing much for you take it out.  Thankfully respeccing skill points is cheap so theres a lot of room for experimentation.  Pretty much all the buffs along the bottom of the soldier tree are good  pointers though not the shield based ones if youre sticking with a h wep obviously.  I like to max Military Conditioning extra health is always useful.Similar to PoE adequate gear can usually make up for a few bad choices in the skill tree.  ,Grimdawn,ddbb27w,1,t5_2s6i9

For skills with cooldowns the effective attack speed is really really low.Dont pay too much attention to sheet DPS.You should definitely take a look at using Cadence with Deadly Momentum on leftclick and using ABB on rightclick. Alternately you can use boring old autoattack and load up on WPS Weapon Pool Skills  things like Belgothians Shears Zolhans Technique Amarastas Quick Cut etc. But the real fun begins when you start to combine all of these Cadence  WPS  ABB.

11581720,0,t3_659u0k,I dont know what your damage type focus is supposed to be. Is it Chaos or FireLightning?If its FireLightning youd probably be better off making a Command or Elementalist respectively. If its Chaos you dont need to max Fire Strike or need any points in Static Strike and youd also want Possession. Regardless of your build every single point in Hellhound and all of its modifiers are wasted providing little value for the cost. As a general rule of thumb for any build with Demolitionist you want  Vindictive Flame some points in Blast Shield dont know if theres a specific breakpoint and  in Flashbang and  point in Searing Light. Id also say that you want to remove all points in Temper except for one as youre only getting like  of the physical damage at most and its pretty low value anyways. Overall choose one damage type. If fire you want CoF  and Vulnerability  and Blood of Dreeg  with its modifier  after skills for this one. If its Chaos you want Possession and Solaels Witchfire overcapped only  I believe points in Hellfire Mine Brimstone maxed out and then the usual Flashbang and Vindictive Flame points. And as a clarification the main draw of Possession is the  damage absorption and the flat chaos damage not the  damage as youll already have tons of increases causing a  increase to chaos damage to be a mere  or  whereas  flat chaos damage on all hits will be multiplied by that  that you already have. ,Grimdawn,dg8smfl,2,t5_2s6i9
