There isnt better method anywhere.The realization that there are people even more intelligent than you should help with your feelings of guilt.

Mensa isnt that much different from any other group of strangers in terms of social interaction opinions etc... because its  a group bound together by a trait rather than an interest. Theyre are smaller special interest groups within Mensa but participation in those groups is voluntary and may be nonexistent depending on where you live. ,mensa,dapiqzh,2,t5_2qie6
