8884400,0,t1_d7fmxp4,Yeah Ive been thinking about that but hard to get it right and meaningful so its annoying. I guess one option would be to popup an alert if it will start raining within one hour and you havent opened up the weather app. But even that it slightly complicated you probably only care during the day if its rained already during that day its probably not as important etc etc... requires some thought,spatialapps,d7fs2l1,1,t5_3g4hu
