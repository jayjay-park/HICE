3555776,0,t3_30n5z0,Seems that most of the linkssummons that were in here were reported as Spam  I did not do this..so i checked the settings and it was set to high..so I put them to low..as with all of our mods here we should be able to decipher which is spam and what is not.Also please note that a Store is not required to post here..even if you only have  item to sell you can sell it here.If you sell said item..remove or properly tag the post as Completed with the Flair tag on the post  not the user flairNew changes should be coming soon as well to make this more appealing to us all.Thanks to everyone for being apart of this and the other sub. I appreciate it very much!,TheMall,cpxkz4e,1,t5_37kuh
