6945339,0,t3_4albwy,Thanks for taking up this initiative! Looks like this is shaping into a good accountability group.I would like to just hear about people sharing their experiences  their struggles and successes. Its there personal posts that give me the most inspiration and I feel like celebrating for my groups success. Im sure everyone has their own personal goals. Its great when you share your goals since there may be others with the same objectives and this opens up possibilities to work towards them together.For contribution I will look to share my personal experiences successes struggles and goals to give you guys an opportunity to celebrate as well.Im curious as to how kik and email will be different. I dont have kik but can get it easily  its just that with a common platform I run the risk of ignoring it when there are too many nonrelevant messages. There should ideally be some sort of content filterguidelines. Is it possible to create a closedinvite only reddit group?,NoFapGuild,d13l1ve,1,t5_3d6cd
