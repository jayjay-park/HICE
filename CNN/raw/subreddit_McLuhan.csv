5329565,0,t3_3kggrj,I started with The Medium is The Massage am currently finishing up Understanding Media and The Gutenberg Galaxy is on the way in the mail. I have the same sentiment as you. My best guess is that media and technology is still quite separate from the humanities and the people who engage with it the most are more closely associated with analytic philosophy the scientific community or traditional logocentric thought. Based on my growing understanding of McLuhan his greatness is defined by his ability to approach media and technology not only from the perspective of someone who knows how the technology and media work but also as someone steeped in literature and literary theory who can offer a historical context in addition to the technics. Instead of limiting media studies to machines and computers McLuhan considers things such as phonetic alphabet as a media or medium and traces this element of humanity diachronically. I think that a lot of the people in our Western postenlightenment scientific and fact driven society fail to recognize the importance of this deeper reading. For many people if they dont see something like a  b  c it just doesnt speak to them.You might check out Martin Heidegger and Bernard Stiegler. I think youd really like the documentary Being in The World which explores Heideggers thought and explores the question of the what makes a human different from AI and machines. After checking this out Id recommend the documentary The Ister which delves into how Stiegler reads Heideggers writings on technology and offers a his own critique. The interaction of a human subject or Heideggers Dasein and objectstool being readyathand are very similar concepts to McLuhans  statement the medium is the message. Especially Stieglers reading of the Epimetheus myth.If you enjoy reading Heideggers The Question Concerning Technology is great.,McLuhan,cvswv56,2,t5_2uita
