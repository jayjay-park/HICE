And he doesnt bat an eye if that brings him into conflict with the government and legal system of Amalia where he lives. In fact the more the government opposes his actions the more he delivers divine retribution against the nation and its leaders. And as each conflict results in Amalia viewing him as a greater threat to national security and so dispatches more resources to defeat him he ups the ante using his powers in more and more ways and escalating the conflict  crushing Amalias leadership annihilating Earth United and overthrowing the Temple of the One in Migedon. ,worldbuilding,cejc7v7,0,t5_2rd6n
43205,0,t1_cejak5c,What questions specifically would you like answered? The travellers began as a dissorganized group of human children from a dying world a planet on the outskirts of the last empire of humanity as we know it far in the future of every timeline of the multiverse basically at the point of interdimensional collision and the end of the universe. These children came across a remnant of the most powerful object ever conceived and the thing that brought about the collapse of all perceivable matter in the first place. The ark. So aptly named this multidimensional... Thing no proper way to describe it really brang life to every world in the universes and acts much like midi chlorians from Star Wars. The ark came to them as a small blue orb with golden veins wrapping its surface. This orb of unimaginable power was infused into them giving them unimaginable power and the ability to pass through the very essence of space. These children pretty much rewrote the universe leading to the birth of Maardas deities and titans creating alternate timelines controlling shaping and leading many peoples into  year long civilizations and many more into utter chaos. They were unified at first but as they grew and spread their bloodline across planes a few of their distant descendants with diminished but immensely destructive creative power banded together to form a group of interspacial demigods seeing themselves as superheroes leaping around and trying to help as best they can in creating interworldly peace. They are not quinticential goodguys however each is truly human and as such is just as imperfect as you or me. Also a reincarnation of the original leader of the traveller children from a dead universe has been popping up as an influential rogue in every timeline of the multiverse. He is a great excuse to make mysterious characters. I hope that was an adequate explanation and there is so much more on the travellers I have missed out on. Thanks for showing interest my friend! ,worldbuilding,cejcm6d,1,t5_2rd6n
59083,0,t3_1uqonk,Healing magic in one of my worlds is considered a taboo and should only be used with the knowledge of other people or in high risk situations. But even then its still a big hassle. Healing magic is considered a taboo because it is also a cursing magic. Almost every recorded data of the usage of healing magic ended up with someone having to sacrifice something. One either has to carry the illness injury etc him or herself or sometimes a random person ends up having to pay the price. Of course this doesnt stop illegal usage or even unnoticeable small usage of healing magic.But magical healing is still an everyday practice through potions. Though making successful potions takes lots of practice and learning many who apply to be a potioneer are usually asked to open a personal store if they are very skilled potioneer if not asked to work for a company or anyone else who sells potions as a business. Some chose to be traveling salesmen mainly to find new ingredients and new ways of making potions. Potioneers have great knowledge on various ingredients thus it is not odd for them to make other types of medication. Medication is pretty easy to obtain in my world though one has to pay for them they are usually not that expensive in most areas. Potions are not some elixir of life. So other form of medicine exist such as surgery and psychotherapy. Their revenue either comes from the government or from their personal business depending once again in the countryareaetc. they live in.Ingredients in countries where doctors potioneers physicians etc. are documented and employed by the government are the only one who can obtain ingredients that serve only for medical purpose legally. In some countries it is only available for those with a license even if they do not work under the government. In some it can be bought freely with of course laws. In poorer countries ingredients for potions and what not are quite expensive as there isnt an exact control in the market and because of the small number of skilled people usually take advantage of the prices to sell medicine that are much more expensive.I think thats it Im kind of tired right now. Yes I did take Potioneer from Harry Potter. Unless I think of another name it stays that way I guess.,worldbuilding,cel5oaq,1,t5_2rd6n

Almost all of us are born with the ability to take materials and create useful objects and ideas out of them.  So why arent we all building wondrous creations to improve humanity and our understanding of the universe?Simply put just because we have the basic ability to perform these tasks doesnt mean we have the aptitude education intelligence etc. necessary in order to use that ability to the full.  Wizards as implied by the name which actually does come from the word Wise do have magic but mostly they have skill knowledge and experience.  A wizard in fiction does usually have magic but mostly they dispense knowledge and good advice for the hero examples of this form of wizard include Gandalf Merlin Dumbledore and ObiWan Kenobi.  Thus being a wizard means far far more than simply having magic.In one of my worlds all but a few who have disorders either from birth or magical disease can use magic.  Not everybody can use it to its fullest extent however as it takes years of training education and intelligence.  Those that do go through the proper training can indeed become wizards... but since magic IS everpresent and therefore not particularly unusual in this universe most rely on others to become wizards while they pursue careers and interests of their own.,worldbuilding,celtyxz,2,t5_2rd6n

If they do they cannot do so faster than light speed.They do not affect their partner when you measure a quantum particle you can only measure one thing or another according to Heisenberg uncertainty. Entanglement breaks Heisenberg uncertainty because measuring one particle disallows you from measuring the second aspect of the second particle.Thirdly particles stay entangled at distance but they cant be entangled at distance as far as I understand. And once a particle is measured it is disentangled. The two particles must thus be isolated from anything that would change their Heisenberg quantities. Youd need really big tubes through space that the particles dont bump into the sides of. Lose containment and the transmission stops. You would need to isolation millions of particles in this way to transmit any significant amount of data.

159928,0,t3_1vwusq,Good question.  Necromancy is an extremely major plot point in one of my worlds.Necromancers Necromantictype magic for most of my worlds history involved the reanimation of dead bodies.  Powerful wizards would need to concentrate as they either manually moved a corpse with magic or reactivated what remained of the brain.  The latter scenario was largely inadvisable as the corpse would often move unpredictably.The sole historical exception for the longest while belonged to the Avatar of the Hebrew God Jeshua ben Joseph multiple gods exist in this world and though they occasionally send avatars they tend to stay out of mortal affairs the Hebrew God is particularly mysterious and is asyet unnamed.  Jeshua possessed the power to truly resurrect the dead heal wounds and give strength unto others modern magical theorists believe he was able to tap into and manipulate an unidentifiable form of life energy.  The most impressive feat however was his ability to selfresurrect after three full days of death.  In time Jeshua disappeared.Almost twothousand years later the Necromancer race appeared without warning in the continental United Empire of America.  Possessing red eyes and abilities remarkably similar to that of Jeshua.  However unlike the Avatar of old these Necromancers are not directly fueled by a god though it is suspected by some that the Hebrew god did indeed create this new subspecies.  Instead the can only redistribute life energy healing a wound or empowering an individual would require energy from either the necromancer or surrounding life forms and the resurrection of a dead creature would take either a far more drastic siphon from surrounding beings or result in the death of a vaguely equivalent being a deer being sacrificed to revive a fallen hunter for instance.Most necromancers used their powers wisely and with care but the few that abused their abilities cast a dark pall over the others in the eyes of the world.  Hatecrimes ensued which revealed the other weakness in this new race the inability to selfresurrect.  In a shocking display the very U.E. military agreed to eradicate this species.  The necromancers desperate and scared returned to the desert from which they came.  In a single moment without so much as preparing an elaborate ritual the frightened tribe drained the lives of the entire pursuing army.  With the lifeenergy they drew they created a massive tree within a few months careful botany and use of their powers resulted in a mighty nighimpenetrable forest.  Over time the natural growth of the forest has only fueled the powers of the necromancers and the modern forest is an impenetrable and accursed vale. None know what lies within the forest but rumor has it that some necromancers still live in hiding in the outside world.  Some believe they serve as wandering healers others speak of them as wandering bogeymen.  And Vincent a highend lawyer and veteran drinker who lives in Atlanta is damn certain that his drinkingbuddy Ivan is a Necromancer what with his fine fancy flowershop and his weird coat pretty damn certain he saw him putting in blue contact lenses bet hes got those creepy fuckin redeyes under there oh god this shit tastes fucking tragic can I have another pint?The fact that hes absolutely right is completely by accident.,worldbuilding,cewndfz,4,t5_2rd6n

309246,0,t3_1xmkym,Theres only one way to get truly powerful freeform wish magic in the world via an ancient magical artifact of unknown origin it predates recorded history. It is divided into three pieces and must be assembled to function. It grants a single wish and then the three component parts instantly teleport away to random locations scattered and hidden around the world. It hasnt been used often since tracking down and recovering the pieces is always a herculean task.The wishes the artifact grants can be extremely powerful and the artifact is not malicious and wont deliberately try to misinterpret or twist the wording of the wish to mean something other than whats intended. However it also wont take any care to determine the actual intent of the wish rather than the literal meaning of it. So those who use this item usually take a great deal of time and care crafting their wish.The most interesting known example was when the artifact was used to save the life of the Empress of Flowers who was dying from an incurable form of cobra venom an assassin had struck her down with. In an effort to ensure that there were no loopholes or other flaws in the wish a multipage document was drafted. This is typical and usually works well to ensure that the results are predictable. But due to the hurried nature of the drafting the result of such a lengthy document was to essentially confuse the artifact instead of clarifying the request. The artifact did its best the Empress was saved and indeed became immortal in the process but was also transformed into a gigantic cobra herself. Not quite what was intended by the documents drafters.Fortunately it all worked out okay in the end and the immortal Serpent Queen continued on to rule the Empire of Flowers for a millennium of peace and prosperity. The original document containing the wish was lost before it could be reviewed and the exact cause of this side effect was determined.,worldbuilding,cfctkmr,4,t5_2rd6n

313399,0,t3_1xoqus,Hierarchy of the BasilicaDuring the discussions leading towards the Unity Pact and the eventual creation of Elementarianism one topic on the table was that of how the Basilica would be structured. After much deliberation and planning the Hierarchy of the Basilica was created otherwise known as the Lines. The Lines are divided into two sections known as the Illius and the Tyrao. The Tyrao consists of the Upper Echelon of Elementarianism those whose name and position does not change no matter which Sect they derive from. The Illius on the other hand is interchangeable between each Sect  some having more Line than the others and different name for each Line. While this could have gotten confusing planning during the Unity Pact ensured that each Line follows a set of rules.I would have a table here but I keep screwing it up when I try to put it into Redditf course as stated above not all Sects have the same number of Lines as the Elemenilavit. For example the Apostles of Erhal have sixteen Lines many of them being different levels of Wandering Monk and other small things. To the other extreme Wrtals Disciples have only one Illius Line the Iliide their version of a Sammok and a Laide combined. The Shogul is the ultimate leader of the Basilica but not only that the Shogul is also the Head of the Trivvalian Government. It has in the past thought that this could be a problem however because of the fact of the intertwined ReligionGovernment the only way for someone to reach the Line of Shogul is to be the head of the Political Party elected by the People of Trivval into Government. Because of this all Shoguls are previously a Justa or someone elected into Government  the Elector House or the Senate. Due to this fact as of yet there has never been a person to be promoted to the Line of Justa without being a Trivvalian Citizen and joining the sway of Trivvalian Politics.This may seem extremely harsh however any Elemeni who is promoted to the Tyrao is given the option of getting a Dual Citizenship with the Religious Democracy and whatever nationality they are currently.In any area where there is a Elementarian presence the territory is divided into individual Saies. The Vix Laider is the head of Elementarianism in that Nation however if there is not a significant presence in that Nation the Vylae the Vix Laiders territory can extend over several areas nearby. From that the territory is divided into Lais usually following Local State or similar governmental borders run by a Dulaier. Below the Dulaier everything is run according to which ever Sect they belong to but always ending in the smaller Saies parish.,worldbuilding,cfd9435,2,t5_2rd6n

412353,0,t1_cfnatoq,Thats indeed where the L and L points will be. But their strength  i.e. how stable an orbit you have there  will depend on the particular pair of objects. Jupiter has a collection of asteroids at its L and L points because its so massive. Itll be weaker for smaller planets and probably weaker as you go further out and get further from the planets gravity.,worldbuilding,cfni8m7,2,t5_2rd6n
414904,0,t1_cfnqsnc,So the L L and L lagrange points are actually unstable! These are the ones that are in a straight line between the two objects. So for the Earth amp Moon these are a partway between the Earth and the Moon b on the far side of the Moon and c on the far side of the Earth. At these points the total force is zero but that doesnt mean theyre stable. Its like being at the peak of a hill every way is downhill from there. So you dont get asteroids and planets in those Lagrange points because theyre unstable. This means you cant have a planet balanced halfway between two stars of equal mass.But theres two more Lagrange points that are stable! They are L and L. These are  degrees in front of or  degrees behind the orbit of the smaller object. Jupiter has the best ones in the solar system and it has a nice cluster of asteroids in each one  the Trojan asteroids. But not every system of two bodies has stable L and L Lagrange points. The smaller object has to be about  times less massive than the bigger object for these points to be stable. So if the main star is the same mass as the Sun the other star needs to be less than  of the mass of the Sun for you to have any stable Lagrange points. The smallest red dwarf is  of the Suns mass so you cant have a red dwarf and a sunsized star with any stable Lagrange points at all!,worldbuilding,cfnrqxz,2,t5_2rd6n

464443,0,t1_cfstku9,Theres plenty of protagonists out there really but the thing to aim for now is making sure all kinds of women are represented as equally strongviable  not just the chick protag but the supporting cast. The thing I liked about ASOIAF was that there were quite a number of different women protagsantags all with their own agendas and nuanced characters. Where Brandon Sanderson fell down was to have Vin seemingly the only woman around to care about. Shan Elariel was a character but she was pretty much a cardboard cutout villain and other women made fleeting appearances. I have only read the first book but now weve cemented the female protag hill at least in fantasy we need to move on to trying to get as many female characters protagonists or no into books. And that includes myself. I write a few women per book but even as a woman writing I default to male. Theres a great write a woman who... meme floating around on tumblr which I aim to write up as a comic or blog post some day portraying the women in my stories. Sometimes its for fear of making women too stereotypical but thats not really an excuse. The two women protags in my first book are quite feminine with one being a bit of a girlygirl and the other having a bit more oomph behind her and because its gaslamp fantasy theres not a heavy reliance on combat so much as on social and political interaction but still most of the action revolves around men. The female antagonist needs a lot more work done on her to make her deeper although as a former prostitute turned workhouse mistress who still solicits company but tries to keep up a more conservative front while working at her administrative role I think Ive made her more solid and subtle than just a stock seductive temptress. Gender roles are more diverse than they were in the real Victorian society but having done some research the picture of that society is more nuanced than it appears to us so I feel I want to give broader opportunities to women within the plot than either convention dictates the single badass tomboy among an otherwise allmale or mostlymale cast or women always having to fight against gender roles though the latter has petered out in recent years or our impression of that society seems to demand. Read Lark Rise to Candleford and A London Family of the EighteenEighties for a better picture of Victorian womanhood than is presented to us right now in popular ideas.Id like to see women given equal billing with men but social conditioning is fairly hard to overcome. You have problems with peoples expectations of gender even from nominally progressive writers  Tanith Lees Eva Fairdeath was meant to chronicle womens lives in postapocalyptic Britain but was a mess because she decided to have the character mention her rape and abusive childhood at every possible opportunity so much so I just stopped caring about her as she never did anything. So its as much about giving women as much agency as menrole within the story as it is about giving us a few protagonists.,worldbuilding,cft24bz,1,t5_2rd6n

492026,0,t3_1zozai,The biggest political badasses in my world is the Empire of Rogar. Their government is essentially an autocratic monarchy but the line of succession is a little strange. Im not sure if theres a word for it. I guess its comparable to how they pick the Pope. There are eight Imperial Families of Rogar that is eight old Noble families The Houses of Gannithon Lerrigo Kastomir Syntavian Tambaros Maegar Hytovin and Delabanto those are their surnames. The heads of these eight houses form the Rogarian Imperial Council. When an emperor or sometimes Empress dies instead of the title passing to his offspring the Council convenes for a week and chooses the next emperor or empress from among themselves. So you might have an Emperor from House Lerrigo followed by a emperor from House Syntavian followed by an emperor from House Kastomir etc. Its an oligarchical monarchy I guess.The other major superpower is the Republic of Vissidia. They work a little like Canada. On a daytoday level life is organized according to a handful of powerful citystates inhabiting the same continent. Each citystate has its own Chancellor elected every ten years from among the citys council. All of these city states are united under a powerful central government headed by an appointed Prime Minister with a figurehead King or Queen. The central government mostly organizes the Vissidian military one of the best in the world and rakes in taxes from the state governments.Out in the ocean northwest of Rogar and southeast of Vissidia is the little island nation of Caryllia. Theyve got a complicated political history. They started as a loose conglomeration of coexisting tribes eventually confederated into a matriarchal monarchy under a single allpowerful queen. Over several centuries the Queens powers were reduced until finally the Caryllians made themselves a constitutional monarchy with all real power delegated to an appointed Governor who nevertheless resided in the Royal Palace in the capital. However there was a run of several increasingly disinterested monarchs and as of the present although Caryllia is on paper still a monarchy there is no Queen anymore and the Governor is the sole head of state. Nobody seems to mind much as the cultural mindset is still very fragmented and locallyoriented.There are two other nations Istamel to the North of Caryllia and Kagan to the North of Rogar but Istamel is basically a continentsized hippie commune in the woods and Kagan isnt really a nationstate so much as just a convenient designation given to a collection of independent Norselike tribes so neither country is really much of a player in International politics. Theres constant tension between Vissidia and Rogar. Theyve been at war onandoff for as long as anyone can remember in constant conflict over land and resources. Rogar repeatedly threatens to annex and occupy Caryllia but Caryllia is officially under Vissidian protection so if it ever happened it would mean a World War...,worldbuilding,cfw73dm,2,t5_2rd6n

509043,0,t3_1zxkuv,Humans The first mortal race to be created by the gods.Humans are widespread from the frozen northern tundra to the savannah and jungles of the southern continent. From the western hills to the far east humans have settled almost everywhere. Dwarves The second mortal race the Dwarves were created and placed on an archipelago hundreds of kilometres from any other civilization. When the dwarves eventually turned on each other their society started to come apart. They became desperate and depraved they abandoned the gods and though only of war and domination. They almost destroyed themselves but a few clans had the good sense to leave felling forests to build enormous ships escaping before the wrath of the gods destroyed the heretics who remained. The dwarves sailed west and found new lands inhabited by humans and orcs. Thousands of years later the dwarves still sail the seas. They travel in vast fleets acting as traders and mercenaries. They are known to be superior archers with closely guarded techniques to create and use bows far more effectively than any other race.Orcs The Orcs were created at the same time as the dwarves. They are slightly shorter than humans but are bulkier they have skin that is something in the range of brown green or grey. The Orcs were put onto the world in a desert region they were nomadic and all alone until the humans arrived. The two people managed to get along for a time but as encounters became more frequent the two races began to grow wary of each other. The humans became dominant growing out of their nomadic hunter gatherer routes and building towns while the Orcs retreated to the east. As the human settlements expanded the orcs either migrated north or moved into the human societies. Eventually those who moved north reached a land at the edge of a vast ocean. Their shamans decided that this was the end of their journey and they settled into the hills.   the Skraad The Orcs who stayed in the desert and joined the humans eventually declined with very few pure orcs remaining many mating with humans and creating a half orc race which became known as the Skraad. Eventually the nations of the area fell on hard times and who did the majority of humans blame? The Skraad. The half breeds the remaining orcs and the humans who supported them were exiled to the far eastern deserts where they were thought to have died in the harsh conditions. This was not so. Thousands of years later when all memory of the Skraad was lost to the humans in what was now the mighty Bardhan Empire the half orcs suddenly reappeared riding out the sands and attacking Bardha from behind. The humans were taken by complete surprise and surrendered to the Skraad within days. For almost a millennium now the Skraad have ruled Bardha and have proven to be far fairer lords than the ancient humans were.There are a few other kinds of orcs in my world including a group that are savage and wear human skin as clothing and armour but I cant be arsed going into that right now.The Uredar No one really knows where the Uredar came from. Nobody really wants to know. The Uredar are taller than humans. With and average height being around . meters. They have greyish blue greyish purple plain grey or pitch black skin. They have distinctive horns on their heads glowing yellow eyes long tails and legs like a horse minus the fur that end in clawlike hooves. noticing similarities anyone?The Uredar appeared suddenly one day marching out of  volcanic mountain ranges in the Grey Islandsthink Mordor in island chain form. Wars raged across the Grey Isles as the human nations tried desperately to repel this threat. They could not these creatures possessed a burning insanity that would have any human executed for the good of his town. The Uredar seemed to have no concept of reason no motives but to fight. Fortunately ever since they conquered the Grey Isles they have seemed perfectly content to stay put and fight amongst themselves.As far as Uredar society goes... Im still working on it.

528227,0,t3_206p9m,A long time ago I started with an idea spawned from several inspirations. I continued to work on this idea as a story for several years. About  years ago I developed the map for it with a friend. We started with a large piece of paper and just started scribbling in random directions then perfected it from there. After that we bent the locations in the story to match the map and since then I have been building the story around the map and visa versa. The world and its history have grown quite a lot through the years. I think a good way to develop a world is to question it. That is why I love this subreddit. It often makes me question things about my own world that I had never considered before.I tend to freewrite. An idea pops into my head and I develop it. If I like the idea well enough I brainstorm it for about a week marking any other ideas down until I think the initial idea is strong enough to become a story. Then I decide the main plot points and where I want the story to go and connecting those dots is done on the fly as I write the story. The only time I actually plot and outline is if I get stuck or something gets confusing and I need to iron it out but this rarely happens. I use LibreOffice for writing and notepad for notes organizing them by story era topic race etc. Many of them have a few of the same note lines as the idea crosses topic. I have about  note files with several pages in each.I know this process works because I am almost finished with my rd book using this method and I have never tossed out large sections of the story or rewritten whole chapters because something I wrote at first did not work. The largest I have had to rewrite was maybe a few paragraphs. If it doesnt work I wont write it to begin with.If you really want to write you will find the time.

558853,0,t3_20iwla,You are now a prisoner of war under the custody of the Tecarian empire.You and the other prisoners are loaded into a truck its moderately cramped the seats are solid metal and the walls lean inwards this wasnt designed with your race in mind. The truck trundles along for a few hours occasionally jerking forcefully when it hits a pothole or something you assume they are potholes you cant see anything outside save for some light coming in through an open hatch in the roof probably used for a gun usually you can see that there is no such thing currently present.Eventually the truck comes to a stop and the doors open a squad of soldiers is waiting outside they escort you all out of the truck and into a line you can see the prison or at least its perimeter moderately high walls you guess around  feet line the entire compound interrupted only by watch towers placed at regular intervals and a large gate right in front of you a tower on either side of it you can see snipers in the towers watching the inside of the facility. After an hour or so of inspecting you the gate opens seemingly of its own accord your expectations for the camp were...incorrect to say the least laid out before you is a veritable slum tents shacks all manner of structures typically associated with the poor and homeless erected in a massive open area with a large gleaming metal structure on the far end the guards instruct you to report to said structure you find this odd until they dont follow you through the gate it simply shuts and you are left by yourself. As you work your way through the camp you work out a few things based on the fire you guess there is no mess hall and based on the building tools you see some prisoners wielding you guess that explains the shacks but most worryingly you can tell from the smell of death that the Tecarians do not regulate or attempt to control these prisoners. You finally reach the structure which has its own guards out front a quartermaster is standing in front of a loading area while assistants hand supply crates out to prisoners you approach the quartermaster who regards you for a moment before instructing one of his laborers to give you some shelter which like everything else seems to comes in a wooden crate a hammer to remove the nails is on top of the crate and based on the weight you guess its full of more lumber you ask the quartermaster what you are supposed to do with this he simply informs you that you are free to do whatever within the confines of the camp if you wish to build a cabin they will provide the materials and tools if he is content to stay in a tent like so many they will provide that as well the quartermaster goes on to state that you will be responsible for preparing your own food which will also be provided by his men and to be careful while violence against other inmates is strictly prohibited the camp is very large and the guards are understaffed so things tend to happen.Resolving not to be shanked with a screwdriver you decide it best to make some friends after staking out a viable spot to sleep you strike up conversation with those living around it inquiring as to the state of life in this camp you imagine it is terrible but their response is fairly mixed the food and medicine is good and guaranteed so long as nobody steals it they tell you. You find this odd but you suppose the Tecarians dont use such resources themselves so it makes sense youd not get the leftovers you ask about the other inmates and they inform you that this is a POW camp not a federal prison everyone more or less comes from the same place aside from a few who go a bit native so to speak and treat it like an actual prison the others are generally agreeable because the Tecarians like to distribute things in bulk inmates will typically send one of their own to retrieve supplies for all them though with so many people it varies they inform you that as the new guy theyll be expecting you to get their rations tomorrow and offer to help get you a roof of some sort to sleep under for now.

621845,0,t3_219m26,I had a science fiction setting once that dealt with several larger sentient species. One such species evolved on a highgravity planet so their biological capacities were pushed to the absolute limits. Their vascular blood pressure was unimaginably high the fluids in organs such as their eyes and spine were highly adapted to pressure resistance and their muscular systems were evolved to flex and relax in a much more rigid nature. They were bound to walking on four feet throughout their entire evolutionary chain.   They evolved on a planet dominated by approximately a dozen small and isolated grassland continents so wind was a major factor in their evolution. They developed evolutionary cavities in their thighs and lower legs that could shift oils and Spermaceti. These cavities could fill and drain throughout a secondary vascular system acting as natural counterweights.The key issue in their evolution was nutrition. The ecosystems of this planet varied widely from continental region to continental region. These creatures which were the size of large elephants grazed on various shrubs and grasses. However due to their size and calorie burning rate they were creatures that traveled in small and isolated pods. Most pods were isolated by several miles at a time. Due to their slow movement heavy bodies and wind handicap these creatures developed advanced  echolocation. They could shift their Spermaceti to a watermelonsized vocal organ located near what we would recognize as their abdomen.                 ,worldbuilding,cgayd86,8,t5_2rd6n

705042,0,t3_228myf,This is a pretty lowres map of the districts within the Tswalafr Rufanui the Most Sacred Union of Rufaen Peoples. There are  districts. The capital district is Ilarum thats why its city dot is so big! and that city is home to the Titansgate Witchmoot and a ton of art. The Titansgate is one of four socalled Greatgates in the Rufaen Union. Greatgates are really big fast travel nodes that you can move large amounts of men and goods through. Theres another one in Cadhala the Lionsgate another in Teruma the Eaglesgate and a final gate in Attatur the Fishgate.Cadhala is a powerful merchant state ruled from the city of Cadhala. The local legislature is democratically elected although House Tarakhal rules as hereditary Wardens Paramount of Cadhala the city and the district  district isnt quite the direct translation but we. Edylla is home to the Civil Service and the Hall of Births and Deaths. Diconion is home to the Great Library of Doscorol who is believed to have scavenged many of its books from cities all over Carenion after the collapse of the Faenic Empire. Cadhysh is where the majority of the Unions military comes from. Every year the Cadhysh Wargames are held there and the Cadhysh district army is also large men and women from all over the Union can join the Union army but districts also tend to raise a small selfdefence force of their own centralisation is incomplete. Cerya looks pretty massive and as if itd be a dominant power in the region. But it isnt. Its the largest by land area yeah but its also the smallest by population. Population is clustered into urban centres around each of the Greatgates and apart from that around the coasts. Edylla is pretty populous because it has the Civil Service and people from all across the Union move there to take up posts. The city of Ilarum is the biggest city in the Union and actually the third biggest on the continent. Its home to  people.The Union itself is one of the three primary powers on the continent. The others are the Cafren Henwalad and Carui Henwalad then there are a bunch of smaller entities. A large section of the continent is uninhabited currently rendered unlivable due to an ancient faenic working. Faenic people who stay too long in the region tend to go a bit crazy. It starts with itching that becomes progressively worse. An Academic known as Esyngaltr the Weary travelled into the region as far as one of the ancient ruined cities but she was forced to leave when she realised shed scratched deep cuts into her face and arms.The Rufaen Union is km long from end to end. Its a really big place. I can actually break the districts up into smaller areas which represent Witchmoot constituencies but that would take a bigger map and Im not quite ready to do that it might not even be strictly necessary. The size is really only possible due to Faenroad network which allows for travel between e.g. Cadhala and Ilarum in only seventeen days.,worldbuilding,cgkezwv,1,t5_2rd6n

757500,0,t3_22tfv1,For the love of the stars keep your fingers still when traveling anywhere on Arys. Almost all easy methods of manipulating magic require the use of complicated finger gestures and most people arent well versed in magic. If you use your hands while speaking and move your fingers around too much a stranger will get suspicious  and if you point at them after the gestures youve basically guaranteed at least a criminal trial. And if the triad judging you doesnt have a genuine mage sitting on it youll probably get convicted of malicious sorcery or casting a spell on someone without consent. The latter offense gets you a brief prison sentence or a fine the former depending on the judged severity can get you an execution. In either event its very rude as it makes the person youre speaking with very uncomfortable.Also the rule of hospitality is the norm in most areas of the Great Desert in the heart of the continent especially during a sandstorm or worse a shardstorm. Its good manners to shelter travelers who ask for it for free and to at least provide some kind of meal if they stay overnight. Its a custom that has become established in the absence of any sort of largescale trade and thus an absence of inns for travelers. Not sheltering a traveler under normal circumstances is extremely rude unless you have good reason during a sandstorm refusing to offer hospitality can ruin your reputation. During a shardstorm that carries the same penalty as murder. For the travelers part if someone offers you hospitality after the suns set its good manners to accept even if only to share a meal and cup of zenai.,worldbuilding,cgqdurf,3,t5_2rd6n

765473,0,t3_22x8fd,Ive got a similar situation in one of the southernmost nations on Arys. Icaril is a theocratic state on an island chain just north of An Getangi the south polar wasteland continent that is the sole source of the extremely useful material Blackstone. On the islands where blackstone is processed blackstone dust has become a sort of commodity currency and is freely exchanged for other goods and services. On other islands the dust has to be exchanged for gold Roses a type of coin minted in Alar  Rose  far to the north.It started out as pure commodity money but through contact with the wider world its become more and more of a fiat currency since price fluctuations were starting to annoy South Islanders who did business outside Icaril. Theres a fixed value for a certain amount of blackstone dust now when used as currency at least and its a reform thats persisted despite Icarils efforts to control the global blackstone price using its virtual monopoly.Id say the effect on native and foreign economies would be fairly predictable. The producing nation would become much wealthier since its selling its money for more money basically exchanging one dollar for five euros the buying nation would just incorporate it as another commodity for the free market to digest.As for my world Ive already mentioned blackstone but thats viable as a currency only in very few places. Most nations mint coins out of electrum silver and copper the currency of international trade though is the Rose the official currency of the Kingdom of Alar. Alar cut a deal long ago with the Roshriadim  seadwelling nomads who have a stranglehold on international trade thanks to the mix of seafaring acumen and seatoair warspells  where Alar would mint coins for the Roshriadim who otherwise lacked the capacity to mint their own unified currency in exchange for Alarim ships exemption from Roshriadim tribute. Roshriadim moneychangers simply started converting all other currencies into Roses to simplify things and the coin eventually became universally accepted.Arys has an interconnected global economy held together by clipper ships and other fast cargo vessels. Airships are common for trade overland since the vast majority of Arys is covered by open deserts or jagged mountain ranges that make ground travel dangerous but their brief stint as the transoceanic transport of choice was abruptly ended by the Roshriadim realizing how dangerous they were to their way of life and starting to torch blimps on sight. They won the subsequent wars with the coastal powers through a mix of guerilla tactics ie burning ports at random and sinking every cargo ship they saw and conventional victories over enemy navies and the International Covenant of Marine Trade was forced on the defeated states forbidding  transoceanic aerial trade.,worldbuilding,cgrafvb,5,t5_2rd6n

Also in Pasinee culture it is considered poor form for a nonfamily adult to weep at a funeral as a man should not leave sadness in his passing.  Pasinee families often invite comic singers and entertainment to follow the funeral procession to keep those involved smiling and happy.

The best thing you can do is take cultural ideas and emblems and flip the script on them.For example the The Elves of my world resemble many cultures. One in particular is Regency era England Colonial and Civil War America and France after the French Revolution. Not far from them is a band of Orc tribes which resemble indigenous Andes mountains Indians and Inca. However the Orcs are actually colonists and the group of Colonial America like Elves have dwelled in the region for thousands of years. In my view the best thing or I guess the easiest thing is to flip the scripts or make fundamental changes that while these cultures on a superficial level resemble human cultures Because I think its mostly impossible to really imagine a culture so fundamentally alien to humans.... being humans ourselves and having no aliens to see and get ideas from.

Among them was a young deckhand only a young boy of six. He had the dark skin of one from the far southern continent and he was quickly bought by a Thane of King Ragnar. He spent a decade working in Karstheim. For those long years he labored hard in the house of his owner until he gained favor in the eyes of the Thane whose name was Iver Stormeye. Iver who lacked an heir took Hakim as his adopted son. The court looked down on this action but Iver taught his son the ways of the Nords how to fight and pray to great god Galdyr. He even took him on raids to the Wesmeran coast.Everything changed one day when Iver ended up in a drunken quarrel with the king over his right to have a slave as his heir. The king ordered his thane to be executed and his head to be placed on a stake outside the great hall.Hakim took up his fathers sword and entered the great hall of Karstheim in a rage. He fought like Galdyr himself and many of the kings guards were slain. Finally after a long and bloody slaughter Hakim took the kings head and his crown. No one dared defy him.

They have extra light sensory which allows them to see colors that the other races cannot see as well as minor vision improvement in darkness andor having minor heat vision andor a tremor sense.Gatori years A race of Alligatorlike beast men who come from the jungles and swamps of the southern region of the Great Republic. They tend to live in sparse tribal villages that govern themselves except in times of crises a council of tribal elders will assemble. They are naturally about as strong as dwarves and have more dexterity but have less con due to a weak bone structure hollow bones. They are natural hunters and skirmish warriors. They have resistance to disease and poison and can hold their breath underwater for up to four hours. Vision is improved in the dark and underwater.The Gatori are thought to have evolved on the southern end of the great eastern continent. They came eastward toward Basiliscara by island hopping over a period of thousands of years and actually came to the continent pretty recently sometime in the last  years the first elven empire was flourishing at this timeSkith The Skith are a race of kobold like reptiloids from the northern desert region of the southern continent. Typically nomadic or living in vertical stone cave villages carved into the desert cliffs. Being of the desert they are naturally resistant to heat and can go days without food or water. They excel in speed but many choose to avoid combat and make a life trading. They have strong people skills and get the best deals when bargaining or trading.Beast Men Beastmen are humanoid mammals. They have the greatest range of senses but because of this they are also susceptible to sound light and scent based weapons i.e. sonic screech flash bomb pepper spray. Most beastmen come from the Great Eastern Continent named so due to its massive size stretching from the Northernmost Pole to the Southeastern hemisphere.Rakasa A race of catlike people whom live in the central grasslands in the East. They are highly stealthy quick witted and charismatic. In addition the Rakasa have night vision and can use their sharp claws in an unarmed attack.The Rakasa are said to be the Eastern answer to elves. They too have created a vast and powerful empire but the difference is that their empire still stands. The Rakasan mainland nation is almost as large as all of Alascara. It stretches from the dry and arid mountain deserts of the north to the lush and wet jungles of the south. Most of the nation is sparsely forested grassland.Rakasan creation myth states that there is only one true god a great lion that called creation from the void with one mighty roar. It is said that he made the land from his dung this has been changed to blood or bones or flesh and traced its outlines with his mighty claws that the oceans are his tears and freshwater the saliva from his tongue that the air is his breath and that the creatures of Thera were created from hairs that he shed from his body. The Rakasans are born from the golden hair of his mane lower animals the more common hairs for his body and finally the more disgusting animals are made from is tail or backside hair. This great lion is considered to be a benevolent god even though he is also the source of all evil. He is seen as a loving and stern father using evil as a form of tough love. Yes a certain event might seem evil in the short term but certainly there is an ultimately good endgame that can only be seen my he whos golden eyes see the infinite.NewThe Rakasan creation myth has also caused political uproar. According to the myth Rakasans are the height of creation and superior to all other beings. The existence of Humans and Elves has caused a legal and theological problem. Right now nonRakasans hold a title of Noble Animals animals that are recognized to have thinking faculties. There is debate as to whether or not a nonrakasan can serve The Golden Lion whether or not all sentient beings should be considered coming from The Golden Lions mane etc. No matter which stance they take Rakasans are very proud of their race and culture. They enjoy the finest of both nature and culture they have freedom under law but a strict religion that limits their behavior. They are proud to have found a balance between the elven Do as I say and the Republican Do as you please.Lupian Fenirian A race of wolflike beastmen. They are not werewolves because lycanthropy is a magical polymorph effect that works on the victims a Lupian can still be infected with lycanthropy and transform and lose sanity under the full moon. They come from Wolfwood The Northern Oasis a warm mountain valley roughly the size of New Hampshire deep in the mountains of the Northfrost a land the size of China that is lifeless except for the elementals and the occasional animal that struggles to survive. Most live in the large central tribe in Wolfwood. They are considered a huntergatherer society and feed mostly off of the Elephant sized stags that roam their land. Lupians have strong wolf senses and have a resistance to frost. Not much is known about them as they were only discovered  years ago. Most in academia considered them a myth until a prominent gnomish scientist introduced a living Lupian warrior he had become friends with. Their history is a total mystery. Some attribute the ancient megaliths of Basiliscara to them though the modern Lupians do not work with stone and have no tools or even knowledge concerning stonework. They have an animist mystic religion with witch doctors and shamans acting as conduit to the spirits of nature. They use stone and wood tools have no written language tribal knowledge usually being kept by shamans or seers. Some scientists have proposed studying the Lupians as a way of studying how other sentient races developed thousands of years ago.Lupian seers say that many years ago their land was much larger than it is now. It is said that one of their ancient tribal elders angered the God or spirits or spirit of frost and that caused the frost to consume their land.

Rain shadows have certainly influenced the formation of the deserts in the USA but they had help.Remember that the subtropical highs the zones of dry descending air that generally give rise to deserts are not fixed. They move north and south depending on the weather from day to day and longer term multidecadal changes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation Its better to think of the latitudes between    degrees north and south of the equator as being bands of generalised aridity rather than bands of true desert  though you will find deserts within them.The only major hot desert on Earth which is entirely outside these latitudes AFAIK is the Somali desert which is unusually close to the equator.

1116526,0,t3_26vzcl,Humans tend to thrive a bit like moulds and bacteria. Anywhere there is fresh water and food theyll grow quite nicely.For a city to grow it needs fresh water food something to build their city with and some way of sustaining the economy like unique food spices minerals. Easiest way to do this is to be near the coast in a natural bay to ship good elsewhere. On that western river city everyone keeps talking about theyll have access to minerals from the mountains and likely some nice game and herbs from the forest that because its separated by a continentwide mountain range is only found in those forests. The forest would also supply the wood for buildings.As for the eastern side having open plains to build your city on is a lot easier than starting in the middle of a massive forest because whenever you wanted to expand youd have to clear the area. Eastern side has a lot of forest and no doubt rough terrain from all those mountains being so close to each other but the north east by the river looks like a good spot. Keep in mind how easyhard it would be to move big ships through those small straights which would hamper trade and thus growth but also keep in mind that a half way point in a long trade route benefits from the caravans and ships that stop there along the way.Cool map by the way.,worldbuilding,chv7iwg,7,t5_2rd6n

As referenced by their name they frequently hijack cargo and sometimes passenger ships traveling through the New York City Cluster smashing and running before police units can arrive to fight them off. It is unknown where they operate from but the current consensus is an asteroid base beyond the outer planetary rings or even a junked cargo ship in the Staten Ship Graveyard. Several things are known they do not use any ship larger than a patrol corvette or escort frigate the ships they do use frequently change and they have stealth paint and engine baffling to mask their signatures. In the past  years they have captured nearly  billion dollars worth of goods and ships and ransomed roughly  people for  million dollars more. The Federal Investigation Department has declared that any and all means will be used to find and apprehend the pirates but after nearly  years not only have they not found anything but the instances of piracy in the New York City cluster have increased by nearly .

1291644,0,t1_cieva1o,Yes outdoor traps exist and are used extensively. Theyll resemble what weve used to halt knight charges but on a much larger scale and designed for higher speeds. For example digging a ditch is practically useless. At top speed a fit and hot Iron Giant wearing nothing can cross a gap m across ms speed  second air time. To keep the Giant in the ditch you need unscalable walls m high. That implies that the ditch must be lined with a material thick and string enough that it cannot be dented to create holds for climbing.With the Giants strength they just have to ram a spear a few centimeters into the walls then jump off it. The only counter you might say is to turn the ditch into a shooting gallery for the javelin throwers on top of the tower. It would prevent efforts being made into climbing out of the ditch.The optimal distance to set up a shooting gallery is m from a missile platform placed equally high since the shooters could throw at a downwards angle adding gravity to initial velocity for killing strikes. Lets go for the smallest ditch possible. Itd be a ring m in diameter with an inner diameter of m and a depth of m. Even by disregarding safety margins for every factor height length distance it comes out as a daunting . km of earth to excavate and . km of walls to cover. And all of this can be defeated by two giants working in tandem.For the other forms of traps such as rows of spikes there is more hope but they also fall into the category of uses up a fuckton of metal these giants just dont have. What I envision for the majority of the fortresses that havent pooled their resources together is something that slows down the attackers enough for the archers to hit them instead of trying to outright stop them. The first and foremost of traps deal with the footing. As you might suspect running across unhardened ground with one ton of weight if not more balanced on the soles of your feet is pretty difficult and it becomes extremely dangerous at top speeds. Footwork calculations have given me leg speeds reaching peaks of kmh.Tripping on a rock at those speeds does more than hurt your toes. So the best solution is to make the terrain uneven unpredictable and full of lowtotheground obstacles.You cant do this by simply digging pits in the ground for two reasons Each step lifts the giant by about a meter and crosses m before the next leg strike. Yes Hz leg motion and two theres goddamned hurricane winds erasing the surface. So youd pretty much have to strew the area with rubble while leaving channels for your own defenders. You could also create flammable areas of weed. They wouldnt hurt the attackers but theyd reduce visibility and reduction of how far you can see greatly impacts how fast you can run.

The English name is Skylord just for ease of use nobody in the world actually speaks English It is basically a giant birdlike creature with a blue bottom colouration making it hard to see while its flying in the desert sky while its back is filled with an impressive display of colours some of which are shiny. It has eyes which are located rather low on its head and most impressively it has the uncanny ability of casting Negatism magic specifically the type which reverses gravity being able to fling prey or other objects into the sky and letting it drop back often with fatal consequences.They are relatively intelligent animals.They largely live off of fish desert animals Raw Magical Energy and occasionally they will attack a tribe of nomadic people sending their landboats flying into the sky and crashing down. This is very risky for a Skylord though as the nomadic people often have powerful magics themselves or even mechagics to fend off the Skylords.They are very efficient gliders and it is believed that they stay in the air partially because they reverse gravity on a part of their body to reduce their weight significantly.,worldbuilding,cifewts,5,t5_2rd6n

It is said that this era ended after a period of massive migration from the Far West to the Far East left the Witches of Dagrib as the preeminent power of the Far West and the peoples of Sarnya richer and more sophisticated. The Witches used this new found position to wage holy war against the Winged Kings who exhausted from war were eventually forced to cede control of Sarnya to a new emergent power the Imperium. From northeastern Sarnya the Imperium conquered the western Chiefdoma the eastern tribal confederacies the islands of Jabal and Bal and finally the Cape of Palms where the Imperium established Danchis or satellite territories to help bolster their rule. Eventually simultaneous revolutions in eastern and western Sarnya caused the dissolution of the Imperium whose ruins still lay along the Remnant Coast. In eastern Sarnya republicanism took root and a confederacy of republican cities took control establishing the Republicium of Eastern Sarnya. In western Sarnya the powerful Chiefdom of Kyaz managed to unite the tribes of the Chiefdoma the haughty northern tribes of Spirillium and the southern tribes of the Zazenlands under its banner establishing the Kyazar. In Jabal and Bal a small group of wealthy islanders managed to wrest control from the former Danchi of the Imperium while the Danchis of Nermeathea Acartha and Erin remained relatively the same albeit independent. The Kyazar eventually came to conquer and occupy the Republicium of Eastern Sarnya. This lasted for a period of almost fifty years until a young prophet managed to lead a successful revolution and expelled the occupiers. The prophet then established the Shal of the Prophet a new theocratic state lead singularly by the Prophet. With the goal of racial unification the Prophet of the Shal now wages a war of expansion to the East against the Danchi of Erin. Meanwhile the Kyazar embarrassed by the loss of eastern Sarnya looks for a new conflict in which to redeem itself. This will leave the Kyazar vulnerable to the manipulation of the Witches whose envoys have long been an established presence in the Danchi of Nermeathea and who want nothing more than to have the nations of men join in their ancient holy war against the Winged Kings.,worldbuilding,cii12z7,5,t5_2rd6n

1382620,0,t3_29w61x,Hey you asked for detail Im gonna give you some detail......The Fisherdrow are my favorites right now.Many millennia ago the grey elves drove out the ruling family of the drow over a conflict the drow started replacing the heir to the greyelf throne with a changeling. These days Pax Elfhame has led to an uneasy detente cold war with the drow whom are now referred to by the proper citizens of Elfhame as Underhill Fae.As luck had it the ancient drow were loaded onto ships and sent to sea to die wrecked on the far continent of Mboshu. After a few decades of war the locals of the island humans dwarves and gnolls destroyed the drow culture by kidnapping all the children and killing all the adults. The fisherdrow culture that evolved after that is very much a Polynesian analogue. The fisherdrow are so closely tied to the sea that people of Mboshu believe fisherdrow must breathe sea air every day to remain healthy. The men have a reputation for being wanton and easy with affection a good wife will keep her husbands in hand but a good hostess will also offer any of her husbands beds to an honored houseguest. Whether the husband wants to sleep on the floor or with the guest is his decision.. There is no strong source of magic on Mboshu and the fisherdrow are the most physically weak of all the races so the perception is that they must be taken care of.When a fisherdrow child is born a gnoll will insist on being its godmother and dedicate her lineage to nannying the child until it reaches adulthood. Fisherdrow go into estrus twice as often as their Underhill Fae cousins do so by elf standards they reproduce quite frequently. This is the primary reason the Underhill Fae want to reclaim their lost cousins.Speaking of the gnolls ....Again there are your more typical gnolls that live in the northern continent of Elfhame. They are based on striped hyenas. Scavengers and worshipers of a cruel god they nonetheless have strong familial bonds and form lifelong monogamous unions. Packs do not work closely with other packs and they are not particularly intelligent although they are still very cunning killers. The striped gnolls are longstanding allies of the Underhill Fae. Im still working on the striped gnolls.The gnolls of Mboshu are based on spotted hyenas. They are smarter larger and more sociably inclined. But they are also fiercely matriarchal the lowest ranked female is still higher than the highest ranking male demanding and violent. The spotted gnolls believe it is their role in life to be protectors and mothers to the other races of Mboshu bearing in mind that gnollish mothers not exactly sweetness and light. Their culture could best be described as a nomadic Masai analogue. The most unusual thing about the Mboshu gnolls other than their claim that only a gnoll has the right to rule the land and everyone going along with it is the close bond they have with the humans of their land. They live in similar ecological niches and have similar nomadic lifestyles only differing by their sleep wake cycles gnolls being nocturnal. Instead of constantly being at war human tribes have formed close alliances with gnollish packs. In this day it is said that the gnolls and the humans form one people as the sun and moon form one day.Im working on the dwarves now as they have been sadly neglected. Again Elfhame is the home of your stereotypical harddrinking mining nearisolationists. The dwarves that ended up in Mboshu are still craftsmen and goatherds but there is almost nothing to mine Mboshu is rich in obsidian but poor in metals and the only thing resembling a mountain is the volcano near the coast.Open to any ideas for my poor neglected dwarves.....,worldbuilding,ciplfnu,2,t5_2rd6n

In place of names they address each other by a  digit ID number assigned by the government which is used by tge government for bookkeeping and used by the individuals as one might use a proper name in casual conversation many find it somewhat unsettling to hear them refer to each other as mere numbers but this likely stems from the Tecarians reputation of self sacrifice for the good of their empire which is a somewhat exaggerated phenomenon while many Tecarian soldiers give their lives in battle to protect those of their brothers in arms this is motivated more by a collective sense of self preservation than by any sort of nationalism. ,worldbuilding,cise7oi,3,t5_2rd6n
1408375,0,t1_cisrh4e,Im glad! and I really enjoyed your reply. Youve put a lot of thought into this and it really shows.gtAs far as scale goes thats not something Ive ever been good with. If I drew out a map and scanned it or something or drew a really sloppy MSPaint one I started doing that but I only have my mouse. If I had a tablet Id be able to get it done easier could you maybe help me on deciding how the scale actually works?Id be happy to help but one of the tools I use when Im trying to rough out an idea for a world is Hexographer It is a free mapmaking tool super easy to use and should be able to help a lot with scale since maps are built with uniform hexes. It wont make pretty maps but itll give you an idea of how stuff will look. gt As for Dullarias armies and supporting them based on a population of  million and probably rapidly growing how many people would a dedicated army be made of and how much would it cost approx in USD...This is a very tough question and I will try to give you some rough answers. First keep in mind standing armies were not really a thing in Europe until after the middle ages. Medieval kings would throw together an army as needed and then disband it as soon as possible. However this site gives some examples of costs of items in the Middle Ages. From there we can see that a Man at Arms pay in the early s is around s which this site works out to about . or about  a day in modern money. So to simply pay an army of . million would require over  billion a year in todays money which does not include any logistic costs food and equipment.Ive seen it estimated that between  and  of Medieval Englands population were knights. Empires that did have standing armies say Tang China and the Roman Empire had armies that hovered a bit under  of their population. Now this all isnt to say that youll be wrong to have a Dullarian army larger than  but its info that might be helpful depending on how close to historical realism you want to get. gt As for the TNs size and population...Arable land wouldve been around  I think for most places in Medieval Europe. So the State of Georgia being around  square miles that means TN would have  square miles of farmland assuming  under cultivation or around  million acres and support a population of about  million. Incidentally this is roughly the same size as England and similar to the population of England around the th Century I think. gtWhat other wealthproducing methods would be viable in a resourcerich country that focuses on producing goods and trading?Textiles and the general production of luxury goods would probably be another solid money making industry for a medievalish trading society. Its what made Flanders and other trading centers in Norther Europe wealth in the middle ages.  ,worldbuilding,cisti9g,2,t5_2rd6n

1515286,0,t3_2bkes1,A couple important ones for the setting my friend and I are working onThe ETF or Extreterrestrial Force is a branch of the military that our protagonist works with. While not their task on other planets and moons here they have come to serve as the American colonies more or less official police force and court system though many colonies and almost all dependent subcolonies make use of their own less regulated justice systems. The ETF is not widely liked on Falya even in the American capital colony Calderwood where their presence is tolerated the most people look upon them as a necessary evil that is slowly becoming less and less necessary. The ETF for what its worth isnt thrilled to have to work as police in addition to preserving the interests of the United States abroad but they arent left with much of a choice.Terra Nostra is an organization with a goal of convincing Earths government to improve conditions on Falya. The planet was colonized and then swept under the proverbial rug once the politicians whod rushed the terraforming job realized how big a mess theyd made out there. Almost ninety years later no real progress has been achieved with the greater international community and various human rights watch groups providing any pressure for that to change. The trouble is that the planet is simply too far away for most people on Earth to care about its wellbeing enough to do anything. In the six years since its inception Terra Nostra has been trying to sway public opinion on Earth and Falya alike but its pacifistic underpinnings have made it seem weakwilled in comparison to the splinter group it is trying to rein in.The Reentry Group is that splinter organization. It is newer and more violent than Terra Nostra unafraid of using threats intimidation and destruction to meet its goals. It doesnt merely want people on Earth to know how bad conditions are on Falya it wants the American government to take back the entire population of the American colonies. Most people outside the Reentry Group know this to be a futile hope but the RG has no such doubts. Though still in its infancy the group has garnered support in many of the northern colonies and has begun creeping south thanks to its populistic platform and generous donations from outside sources who prefer to remain anonymous.The Mint crime family is one such example sorry no anonymity here. They have entrenched themselves so firmly into the southern American colonies that theyre managing to conduct business even more effectively than they were before they were forced into hiding. The Mints have their hands in agriculture hydroponics offworld food shipments narcotics arms dealing and practically anything that makes anybody money south of Calderwood. The ETF and a cavalcade of vigilantes nearly collared them years before they fled into the desert back when the family had just begun to expand from its footholds on the island colony of Flaxton however they received word in time and skipped town long before the military magbikes showed up. Nobody really knows how they manage to do so much and stay behind the scenes but nobodys going to question it as long as theyre still getting paid.,worldbuilding,cj67uns,5,t5_2rd6n

The idea has grown now. For one thing the Mad Priest is no longer the antagonist nor is he even called the Mad Priest. The religion he leads was founded accidentally by a character that the protagonist reveres. I liked the irony of this. The inspirational character was a pacifist therefore the perversion of his belief should be EXTREME pacificism like what I described above. I also needed a major plot point to revolve around the protagonist being accused of and brought to a trial for some major crime but because of the plot treason and murder were out of the question.

1621217,0,t3_2cuwo5,What I usually do is think of the principle values of the religion and where it grew up so to speak. A religion that focuses on mutual respect that was created in the desert is going to be different than one that prioritizes equality that was created in a metropolitan city. As far as values go a lot of the good values are similar across cultures but you still want to try and think of what expressions of them might be different and how the boundary lines might be different. Prechristian Britain was very fond of boasting. Boasting was an art form and a duty and individuals were expected to be able to boast well. Then christianity came around and humility was the virtue.Its also useful to think about what individual practice looks like. Not every religion prays in temples after all. Some religions pray in their household shrines some in churches and temples some dont even have gods to worship. Practice also extends farther than worship though. Fasting in the abrahamic religions isnt really about worship at least it isnt for my branch of christianity but it is about faith and piety. A religion that Ive created uses scarification and tatooing as public markers of impiety. Oftentimes thinking about how the religion works in a personal sense how it works for a believer is more important than coming up with the stories of the religion. The stories should reflect and illuminate the religion and to some extent culture. The myths of a religion are less important than the substance of it.,worldbuilding,cjjiq9q,3,t5_2rd6n

Brownies are beings mostly of the ethereal plane like most Fae but unlike the Upper Fae they have empathy for mortal beings.  Usually they express this by doing small things for people trying to make their lives easier.Fae are older than the world they simply congregate on it because it is a source of distraction.  The world was created by a being purely of the ethereal realm known as the Creator.  The Creator is almost all powerful on the material plane but it is also almost incapable of understanding it as a being of a higher plane.  All it knows is that certain combinations of matter namely those that form living beings have a soul in the ethereal plane a soul that the Creator lives off like a leach.So for many years life on this world wasted away a Brownie rose to the defence of the mortal peoples.  The Brownie organized the races of the world teaching them of the nature of the ethereal plane and together they mounted a resistance against the Creator allowing the Brownie to destroy the Creator.However this left large gaps in the etherial plane known as the void entering these areas cut you off from the ethereal plane effectively making you soulless.  The Brownie and its followers were in a void region and they became Goblins material violent and immortal creatures.  Lower forms of Fae.They swept across the world and destroyed the civilization many of them worked so hard to create.

Most of the population lives in small villages of less than . In turn the points of interest youve drawn represent a very small fraction of the actual population even if you change societal dynamics significantly. So it makes sense to have a mental map of population density which areas are settled and which are wilderness.Obviously you need a fairly accurate scale for that which is also something not represented on your map.,worldbuilding,cjthm94,3,t5_2rd6n

1841864,0,t3_2fik6i,Tradition is a pretty viable reason but since Im assuming these are pretty intelligent people theyre not going to ignore the fact that firearms exist.I think the way Id approach this is for an individuals weapons training to be an extremely integral part of their lives. Like regarded as both an artskill to refine and as something relatively commonplace as say education or hygiene.As external firepower grew more sophisticated their techniques would have evolved with the outside worlds technology. So while they wouldnt bring guns into battle theyd likely have used them during trainingpracticewhathaveyou in order to accurately respond to newer threats.Paired with magic theres even more potential for relevication which is a dumb word I just made up. Perhaps different orders focus on different specific ways to utilize magic? i.e. one uses stealthfocused magics to get the jump on foes another uses elemental forces to prevent foes from being able to respond nearly as properly as necessary for melee combat etc Im not entirely sure augmenting the weapons themselves would do much good the people theyre fighting likely have little to no closequarters combat training in a world with guns. If these orders are so good at using their weapons theyd be just as likely to jam a plain sword into somebodys skull as they would a burning one. However enchanting these weapons to return in combat when thrown stay in ones hands despite the ferocity of battle or travel distancestrajectories that would normally be impossible could be infinitely useful. Seriously consider some kind of projectile augmentation on these weapons. Impossible travel patterns as above using the weapon as an extension for longrange attacks etc.Ultimately physical skill would be the most important part of this you can sneak into an enemy encampment with a sword that wont leave your hands and still get your ass killed if you dont know how to swing it.,worldbuilding,ckb53f7,1,t5_2rd6n

1935336,0,t3_2gsjhb,I like this thread. Forces me to formalize it.Also I have no real names for things despite tossing this world around for the better part of a year.From my the writers point of viewThe cosmos consists of two fundamental forces Lets call them Divinity and Creation.Divinity and Creation exist usually in equal amounts. They are fundamental opposites and can have no understanding of each other. Creation encompasses matter the material universe. Divinity the heavens or primal force.Sentience is a thing of Divinity not creation. Its one of their differences. Divinitys trade off being that things cannot be created out of Divinity. Imbued with yes. Created with no. Divinity as a whole has a limited sentience which is the deity of this universe.Divinitys knowledge and power is perfect in its own realm but cannot comprehend creation. It knows of it of course and can interact with it but does not and cannot understand it.Divinity can be converted to Creation and Creation to Divinity. The amounts of each will always settle to be equal but it does not have to be immediate. A small amount of Creation turned to Divinity could be held for eons. All of Creation turned to Divinity could be held for mere moments. Eventually it will be released and returned to the base form of Divinity or Creation.Divinity can influence Creation build with it unmake it whatever. Creation theoretically could do the same in manipulating Divinity but it has no sentience and no way of achieving it. But it could. The deity experimented with imbuing its creations with Divinity. For intents and purposes well call them Humans though Ill likely never actually use that word. When doing this Divinity essentially split itself into separate pools. It has no control over the force that it imbued. The force can be returned by its own reckoning Just as the main deity could add more to the other pool but it cannot be forcibly regained permanently. Its essentially become a third force While not entwined with Creation the deity may draw from it but it will resettle eventually unless given willingly.Humans are mostly creation and the Divinity within them is outside the deitys control. Hence it cannot fully comprehend them It can have a rough idea but they are partly the same as itself. The deity seeks to either A Undo the work and try again or B Understand the work and let it be. Either or is acceptable.In this the Deity is consuming creation. It cannot be held indefinitely and must be returned. This forms a bit of a cycle. The Deity reforms things exactly how they were and starts over. Humans due to their piece of divinity will not always play out the same way every time Though it will be similar due to environmental factors. The Deity hopes to learn through this process.Finally as alluded to earlier humans may actually increase the amount of divinity they hold by exposure to the Deitys pool of it. When the cycle resets it is released back to the deity Just like any the deity took is released back and were all on square one. Theoretically the timing of creation and divinity being released doesnt have to be to but it is conducive to the learning process the deity is going about and so it encourages it.In Universe ViewOrganized Religion is a thing but its kind of small. Atheism is likewise a thing and even smaller. A doubter simply has to visit the edge of the world and view the void beyond it to be reaffirmed that there is something other than creation.As alluded in the Authors Notes humans can increase their share of divinity almost always by being exposed directly to the void beyond the world. This has two functions. It allows them to communicate mentally with the Deity.. It allows them the same ability the Deity has to convert Creation and direct Divinity. This eats the world in the same manner. A person affected may turn a rock into Divinity direct that Divinity to do some work and then it is sent to the pool.For  this is not madness a la Wheel of Time taint. It is purely a communication link. Many not all are driven insane by the constant voice of destruction but the link in and of itself is not insanity.For  Humans do not know of the cycle or the balance and simply see part of the world being consumed. These two together has made the group quite reviled.As an example someone from this group could say consume a boulder and direct said force to level a city wall. The boulder is gone forever or at least until the next cycle.This group forms one of the Religions of the world. They refer to the deity as The Mad One The One who Destroys The One beyond the Void or really any label that conveys the fact that the Deity is destruction. There really isnt a fixed name.There is one other group small but growing It is quite literally the end times after all. Perpetually. that claims two separate Gods. A Creator force Unnamed by me yet and the same god recognized by the first group. They are in actuality one and the same but this group does not know that.The two groups are in conflict but have a bit of a truce going on. Group A is able to get a sense of what the Deity is doing and no more wishes for destruction than anyone else. Group B has resources being seated firmly in the government of the largest population center remaining. At the low level membership of both they hate each other. At the leadership level begrudgingly they work together to evacuate people from areas that are going to fall.There is a third group working to prevent areas from falling entirely with varying success. They are neutral and work with both Religions but are not a religion themselves and are not discussed here.,worldbuilding,ckme8ai,1,t5_2rd6n

2096148,0,t3_2iv71u,Ok so my story works in  worlds the normal one we live in and the other side where the interesting stuff happens.  Humans dont learn to develop nikai the skill to bend the laws of nature until puberty and until theyre  there is no way to tell who will be a raxen nikai user and who is an ordinary human so the people on the Other Side save themselves the trouble and let children live in the normal world just to recruit them if their powers awake. Some ancient clans of allraxen members can teach their own from a young age but is a blind bet so its not the most common thing to do.  At age  childrens powers start to develop and the nations on the Other Side can detect that. As these kids are literally the future of the Other Side nations fight over them studying their potential powers families personalites etc. in order to chose the children that best represent the Nations ideals and culture so they can adapt to their new society and such. All the Nations on earth get children trying to keep the power balance worldwide.  When the kids are age  hundreds of recruiters cross to the normal world to recruit them by giving them a Calling Stone the stone will only react on presence of nikai and  days after the kids get them they will be teleported to special rooms where they will hear what I already explained.  After that the kids will be summoned to start living and studying on the Other Side becoming members of that world.  The Other Sides nations main concern is education.  Unlike the normal world kids are trained with more practical skills than theory. Graduates from the national academy are skilled fighters hunters chemists builders etc.  Not to say they dont have theoretic knowledge but as they have already gotten the basics of writing math and history on the normal world the Nations Academy mostly teaches how to better bend the laws of nature the history of the Other Side and all kinds of trades. They have  years of studies from  to . Specialized knowledge comes from College and other advanced studies.  Also since age  kids work on the society.  Nations dont recollect taxes so to maintain itself EVERYBODY works for the nation while studying and even after that if the want.   The young students Ages  get the most humble and grunt works like cleaning the city taking out the trash deliveries minor construction farming gardening etc. and get payed for it. This system makes them respect the most humble jobs helps them realize their vocation and skills makes them start earning their money to become independent and saves the Nation tons of money on employees.   Older students and graduates Ages  go out on missions to another Nations having risky jobs as protectors guides scouts deliverers bounty hunters ambassadors etc. Anyone can hire a Nations raxen student and its a way for the Nation and their students to gain recognition and money.   After graduating From  they can work in more administrative jobs security international affairs go to college or become independent workers shop owners cooks doctors builders artist etc. although they can be called to go back into missions or help the nation in times of need... or to get extra money.  As Nations are plenty and really small an average sized Nation is smaller than Texas everyone works like a community.  Each year when the new students are recruited the whole nation welcomes them with a great festival getting to know them and giving them the Sigil of the Nation. The Academy and the Students of every Nation are the center of their culture and everyone knows most of the children of his Nation and the best children from each Nation thanks to the annual fighting tournaments missions etc.,worldbuilding,cl69m63,1,t5_2rd6n

2235667,0,t3_2klqa4,Depends what the weapons are for. If theyre for open warfare then youre probably going to want to stick with whats been thought of already in human history. A big shield much larger than weve had in the past could be used with a very large two handed sword on the other side. Why would you want two weapons getting in the way when youre in tight formation when you could just use a two hander. It would provide much more leverage than the one handed swords that would be used alongside shields for us two armed people. The two handed shield would also provide a likely sturdier defense. Then you could have a very large four handed sword likely used with two hands at the top for aiming and two hands at the bottom for providing leverage and power. You could also have much longer pikes and spears. Also you could have much stronger bows and crossbows may be more common as four arms may make loading them easier. Im not sure how javelins would work out though. It doesnt make any sense to have a two handed dagger though since the length of the blade means that you could never get enough leverage to make it worth your while. So pikes spears and other long weapons like pole arms would still be the main melee weapon of choice two handed swords would be the back up weapon and one handed daggers would be the back up back up weapon. Two hander and shield would find its place in there too. Four handed sword would be a niche weapon mostly used for breaking up pike formation. In addition to this weapons that would normally use up all your hands would now use up only half. This would allow pole arm and shield paring. Though now pole arms would be smaller than their four hand equivalents they still bring quite a bit to the table. This means that instead of just sword and shield you could have pole arm and shield as well. This adds a lot of variety to what could happen in a battle. Armor though may be a bit tricky. Because of the extra articulation plate armor would probably be very expensive if even feasible. Chain mail and leather armors would probably be more common.    If its for dueling purposes as in a one on one fight where no one could get in the way then there may be a bit more room for variety though you could still just stick with the battle field weapons. You probably wouldnt find many one handed weapons apart from daggers and the like. Most swords would probably be two handed simply because you would get so much more power out of them. Though maybe you could have a one handed sword that would be used pretty much solely for stabbing like the rapier. Perhaps you would have two rapiers one in each of your dominant hands I assume the right hands. Attacking with one and keeping the other back in case you need to parry. Maybe you could have two bucklers in the other hands for blocking and parrying. Maybe you would just have a huge two hand rapier and a huge two hand buckler. Maybe a rapier or two on one side and some daggers for parrying on the other. Dagger and buckler for parrying and attacking every now and then? Rapier and sword breaker? Maybe you could have a pole arm on one side then a large buckler on the other. There are a lot of combinations that would be viable and a lot more that wouldnt. Ill just leave it at this though.,worldbuilding,clo09fi,1,t5_2rd6n

Many wetlands particularly where I live in the Canadian prairies are simply shallow lakes which have filled with sediment and sludge over time thanks to erosion and eutrophication These wetlands can be very large depending on the topography and attract thousands of migrating birds every year. Your desire to have a wetland which is not fed by rivers but can still drain might be tricky to justify. Although I could ask how often to want your wetland to drain? Are there rivers constantly flowing out of it? A wetland near me is completely isolated from the surrounding watershed with the exception being when we get heavy spring rains then the wetland overflows into a nearby depression and flows a kilometre to the nearest river. Its a really neat phenomenon to see. If your wetland exists in a region with plenty of rainfall then it could support multiple small rivers year round.Your wetland could be spring fed which depending on topography is very possible. Another possibility would be to design something like the Okavango delta which I know breaks your rule about it not being a delta but this is an example of an inland delta which does not flow to the ocean but is instead caused by the Okavango river hitting a large basin in central Africa.,worldbuilding,clsgcoe,8,t5_2rd6n

You dont have to get too detailed either.For example life on Earth went Organelles amp Reproduction gt Water Mobility gt RNA gt DNA gt Colonies gt Multicellular gt skip a few gt Crawling Limbs gt skip a few gt Opposable Thumbs gt Tools gt Primitive Linguistic Muscles gt Primitive Language Understanding gt Dynamic Linguistic Muscles gt Etc.I could have made that a heck of a lot longer but it serves as a good example.To start with I consider their planet or just one cool aspect of their bodies that I want to include and design a planet that would best support that aspect. For example a gas giant would encourage the production of flying creatures that can withstand intense heat and can see in the ultra violet and Xray gambits. They would also likely be able to smell chemicals like a shark smells blood to avoid nofly zones. That right there can make some pretty strange creatures. But lets take this further and say that antigravity generators are possible in your universe. A Gas giant has immense gravitational forces. Also in some areas liquids form such as closer to the core than the higher gaseous zones. liquid metals will also rain from the sky in some gas giant storms. Considering all of that a creature that could create an artificial gravity field for itself would very much so have an edge in combat. Its muscles and bones and scalesfurfeathersskin would be able to be much heavier and stronger allowing for this creature to dominate in any physical altercation. This creature could also move faster. This kind of evolutionary trait would very very quickly become the dominant trait of the planets most dominant species. This would be akin to being warm blooded on Earth. On Earth the seasons change in such an extreme way due to our fairly translucent atmosphere. On a gas giant most of the heat would come from the intense gravitational forces the friction of the insane weather effects and the core of the planet.These creatures would evolve along a certain path that leads to artificial gravity generators. What is that path? Why did the first generators form? Was it due to a global event involving gravitational forces akin to Earths ice age? For example this could be an asteroid fallen moon or rogue planet strike that drastically increased the planets gravitational pull. Maybe it  was a trait in some creatures already like some kind of gas swimming fish but after such an event it grew out of proportion due to the advantages of such a creature. It would likely have come after the evolutionary sense of gravitational forces which would allow creatures to know when molten metal is falling from the sky. Then after that creature became so common it started to run out of food. How would that creature find more food? Would it evolve a beak so that it could peck into a plant for insects? Would it evolve the ability to spin a spiders web or already had that ability due its evolutionary path? Would it evolve complex hands for building traps?Finally now that that is the dominant trait on the planet the intelligent race that grows out of it will also likely have that ability. The intelligent race would be able to use that ability to move molten metals without touching them and would quickly learn to harvest the materials of the molten metal storms. A collective of them could work together to create a field so powerful that they simply lift off of the planets surface allowing such a race to fly through space at a very early age in their species life. In researching their own biology they may find out how its done and acquire the technology for their ships much faster than Humans and understanding the technologys use and principles would allow for a much more fluid and skilled use of the technology.So now we have a sort fishlike creature with a sort of beak short limbs that can create locomotion gravitational fields long limbs that can manipulate objects outside of their locomotion gravitational field and create grabbing gravitational fields the ability to only see in the Xray and ultraviolet light spectrums and the abilities to smell chemicals and sense gravitational forces to identify chemicals. This would likely form so that its primary sensory organs are outside of its gravitational field but would likely also possess a second set of certain sensory organs to detect things that have made it inside of its gravitational field including a second set of gravitational sensors. It would likely not possess eyes as we see them seeing with a more durable fin or refractory system to prevent strong winds from eroding their eyeballs or perhaps their imaging organs would be protected by a layer of flesh that would not inhibit ultraviolet or Xray light. Their means of communication would likely rely heavily on manipulating their gravitational fields as their sense of gravitational fields and their ability to manipulate them would be akin to our abilities to hear and speak.Oh yeah and dont forget to include the organisms that are between micro and multicellular. Plants or plant like things are a very big deal in the evolutionary tree and are likely very common among life sustaining planets.,worldbuilding,clxmpiw,2,t5_2rd6n

2408624,0,t3_2mylu0,Lets say you are standing on the national mall right now in Washington DC when suddenly you are blinked over to my world.  The first thing you will notice is that you are now standing in a wheat field. The capitol of the nation simply called the District of Columbia is located around  miles north on the Susquehanna river.  To get there you likely have to walk or catch a ride to Georgetown where you can take light rail over to Baltimore and then take the express train to the capital.  Or you can take a car but that isnt done as often in this timeline.  One thing you will notice on the way is that the flag is a bit different.  Not entirely alien but certainly different. Something that is truly different is the capital city.  Having several million more people than Washington DC ever had and burgeoning with classically styled skyscrapers the city gleams in the distance. At the center is the massive  million square foot Great Library.  A huge building of unparalleled size stretching high into the sky on top of the largest capital hill.  Known for supposedly keeping a copy of every book written along with some of the worlds largest museum spaces.A slew of other large buildings of government exist divided into different quarters throughout the classically designed city.  The congressional quarter with a massive legislative building at its center.  The Executive quarter with the white house and the military academy. Finally the Judicial quarter housed in a huge circular structure.

By the time they get out of bed breakfast is ready having been prepared by their apartments hologlyphic assistant who has since selfdeactivated soas to remain out of sight. After breakfast comes a dip in the etheric shower a light show that cleanses the body of dirty and sweat scrubs away dead skin moisturizes and does all the preparatory work for a persons hygienic routine. Following this the individual typically does their own hair and makeup while verbally telling the ARC which articles of clothing and accessories to produce. It is extraordinarily rare that a person has clothing or accessories that are stored away  most of what people wear is fabricated out of ether and as such dissolves over time. Etheric clothing can be worn for days before it complete dissolves back into the air.Many people in Neduin choose to work but no one has to. Everyone has a guaranteed minimum income. People work alongside spirits and sentient hologlyphic programs who have the same rights and responsibilities as mortal humans. Some people choose to instead spend the night partying in the megaclubs shopping for etherspun clothing accessories decor et cetera. There are vast gardens parks and sports centers as well as theatres brothels and plazas. Theirs is a life of recreation balance and meaning.VaserlThe average person wakes before dawn as the steamwhistle sounds. The average worker has a dust shower and heads out immediately after getting dressed in their unflatteringly bulky etherconductive clothing. As they stand in line to descend into the weatherworking machinery of their mechacitystate they are served breakfast and coffee by the magitechsteam robots.In the hot depths of the machinecity they plug their souls directly into the etheric conduits and share their minds and essence with the other works. Together they become a kind of protogod and as such they shape the weather and land to yield crops mine or gather or refine stones metals and other resources to purify and gather water perform repairs and maintenance et cetera.So endless vast and complex is their work that they could never finish it all by hand. It is only by joining together with their city and becoming something like a god that they can get it all done.YehallahThe Spirit City on the edge of the Eastern Desert is home to more spirits than humans. The average persons day begins with the conclusion of their nightly meditation  no one actually sleeps here but instead they spend their night seated in meditative equipoise which through years of meditation has become even more refreshing than actual sleep. Following this come morning prayers  these prayers are different for everyone  some choose to worship the wind some wish to  assert their aspirations to become spirits themselves others pray for food and medicine for the hungry and sick. After prayers comes the work of spirits performed by spirits and humans alike. Some purify prayer flags others divine the future  some work the gardens with song and intent.After this work comes lunch followed by an afternoon of freetime. In the evening comes the last prayers followed by silence until the morning again. During this time there is lanternlit walking meditation through the citys mandalastreets and finally a return home to the meditation box.,worldbuilding,cme3xa4,7,t5_2rd6n

Livinian is  miles from Mossbrunth.As uSchtemich points out that  miles per day figure assumes there are roads to follow and that the roads run dead straight for nearly  miles.

2609954,0,t3_2ppfzi,Alright Ive got one thats pretty simple unfortunately no artwork.  But it is a simple robot.Essentially its a small black flying disc just a bit smaller than a normal human head.  Both its top and bottom are rounded  the bottom slightly flatter than the top.  Both of these are thinner than the center portion that joins them  its as thick as the two combined would be along their thickets points  and is flat and unbroken save for a singular eyepiece which is the only moving part of the robot protruding slightly forward.  This emits a blue glow about the same as a blue LED would emit and has a visible aperture for focusing.  This central part would be perfectly round so from the top itd be a circle save for the eye. The robot is otherwise featureless aside from a pair of indentations  two on top two on bottom  with connecting ports for docking and recharging these would be small indentations which start at the rear half of the robot leading towards the back of the robot with the data ports just before the joining middle section.  These indentations wouldnt be very wide each one maybe equivalent to about a tenth of the robots own width.  They also would not be very deep just enough so to be visible but not enough to have any real edge around them so even easier since you can just draw lines to represent where they are rather than having to worry about representing any depth on them.  There are no visible appendages as the robot uses antigravity to move around and manipulate objects which would appear to float near it whenever it holds them.  The robot itself also floats and can actually achieve whatever height off the ground it desires.,worldbuilding,cmz9bi4,1,t5_2rd6n

Much of the food in the nation is exported and imported but this is for variety to suit the rich peoples tastes. The King finds it very important that his nation is self sufficient and since an enormous part of it is army thats not easy.The upper lands are basically desert with some terraforming not much going on there. The lower lands are very fertile though with a large water system and imported volcanic soil where necessary. I think the focus is on grains and vegetables with fruit mostly being imported from vassal states and colonies. There is a large and very cursed river circling most of the nation and no food is grown near it but the grass is alright for cattle. Fishing is mostly imported but done some in the south just have to avoid the north and the cursed river delta.,worldbuilding,cn035qg,1,t5_2rd6n

Assuming the forests east of Mt Crestmarch are on higher hilly ground its possible for two river headwaters to converge into the Crestmarch river but the Mudeye would probably not split both northwest and southeast. The marshy lowlands would be the more likely path of least resistance for the river to take rather than carrying on to the bay.Similarly the Gabrielle River should work as a Nile analogue but it probably would not flow on to the gulf if it flows down into the desert basin and the Hook would probably peter out into a single terminus rather than forking in two.,worldbuilding,cn5hlyy,1,t5_2rd6n

2688875,0,t3_2qu811,Gearjacks could probably be classified as giants. They represent and comprise the skilled labor force of the kingdom capital Allensgard. Gearjacks are known for being absurdly strong a trait they put to use in heavy lifting hauling and other similar construction and maintenance projects around the city. They do not have a known language culture or place of origin. Allensgard citizens have no idea where the gearjacks come from and treat them like pariah ignoring their existence completely unless absolutely necessary and generally looking down on them. This is especially ironic as gearjacks tend to be about  feet tall with highly defined musculature and a generally imposing physique. Their skin is usually a stony gray color. There are male and female gearjacks but theyre not especially easy to tell apart. Gearjacks are not an especially happy species...they brawl with each other frequently sometimes causing collateral damage. Suicide attempts are even more common than fights. The dark secret of the gearjacks is this they are humans. Specifically former criminals. In the public eye these criminals are sentenced to death or exile but in reality they are handed over to one of the government officials who uses all manner of taboo and perverse magic to essentially remold their bodies as well as to lobotomize and sterilize them. This creates a cheap labor force gearjacks do not need to be paid and they hardly need to be fed as the dark curses woven into their skin are usually enough to keep them alive.

2708640,0,t3_2qznob, World mechanicsThough no one in world has figured it out I have come up with a completely arbitrary values for what the real annual and monthly cycle are. The solar cycle is currently . days long. The lunar cycle is currently . days long. Cultural mechanicsThe starting point is based on the culture that created the calendar. In this case Tarsan is one of the longest surviving country in the civilized world. Families are the most important aspect of society. Lorban the language of Tarsan is based on Lojban This means that most of the initial words come from that language. Changes over timeBelow are the various changes that happened over the calendar over time. Start with the optimismThe initial calendar starts with seven periods masti one for each of the seven families. Each masti is fiftytwo days.. Kasin mastir. Disrobin mastin. Rinfir mastim. Pun mastik. Joknig mastip. Lamaster mastit. Wilim mastilFortunately Tarsan is obsessed with order so this means we can get away with only the acronym of the names for the months.  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  It doesnt take longIt was only a few years after the calendar was established that the fight over the calendar itself became apparent. Since the creators of the calendar were Gof da Joknig de Wilim and Fahin dea Lamaster they were given additional days for their familys months.  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  A bit of infightingThe Disrobin family starts a fight with the Rinfir. After a few decades of fighting it ends when the Disrobin almost goes bankrupt and loses a great deal of face. Unable to recoup the full costs of the fight the Rinfir steals a day.  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  Formalizing the bellsUp to this point most people only referred to the parts of the days into vague organization.. Early morning. Late morning. Midday. Early evening. Late evening. All of the nightThe first five became the foundation of the bells a tradition of ringing a towns bells ten times throughout the day and night each one spread evenly throughout the time. Like many numbers in Tarsan the first is the zerobell all the way up to the ninth bell. The past is never overOne of the greatest hobbies in Tarsan is digging up dirt for someones ancestors. This usually involves a lot of backstabbing gossip and blackmail to figure out. The worst crime of Tarsan is spoiling a bloodline. When something like this happens typically every descendants accomplishments are taken away and their misdeeds magnified.As it came to be Fahin dea Lamasters grandfather on his fathers side was revealed to not be a male and also not the direct bloodline of the Lamaster family. In a patriarchal society linage is equal but only males controlled families at the time this was a scandal. It also negated in societys eye Fahins contribution to the calendar and the two days were stripped from their month. They stripped another day because of the deception.One would think that a fairly accurate calendar  days would not be made more inaccurate but the politics were stronger than research at the time. It would be three centuries before they would get back to the  day calendar.  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  Further breaking down the dayThe length of time with the bells became a little too long for many tastes. Each bell was split into two the divison called a cacra hours cra. This lead to a twentyhour day which is what I meant when I say hours in my novels because its close enough.Likewise the hours were broken further down into mentu minutes ntu. There are sixtyfour minutes in an hour. This number was decided by the woman a talent with perfect timekeeping to honor the seven great families plus her own. This broken up the hours into eight parts and then each one of those broken into eight more which resulted in the sixtyfour minutes. Derobin and Disobin splitThe Disrobin family broke apart a century after the last calendar change and kicked off a civil war that lasted nearly forty years. The reasons were wide and varied but the split was so great that the Derobin family actually split completely from Tarsan and formed a new country of Gepaul.One of the consequences of this was a diminution of three of the month names from the formal masti to mahi. Disrobin mastin became Dobmahin. Pun mastik became Punmahik. Wilim mastil became Wilmahil. Clawing back the days.Three hundred years after the three days were taken from the calendar there was another battle yeah Tarsan fought a lot with each other and Gepaul. Three lesser families Pinnir Xahos and Tibirim who aided Rinfir and Kasin during a border dispute where deemed worth of a great reward. As the nature of the great families these great rewards were typically useless posturing or empty gifts tied with strings. And what would be better than to give these allies three brand new days named after them? But they werent the original great family so they got a single day each yes Tarsan is petty. With Pinnir having the same letter as Pun the lesser families used two letter abbreviations.. Kasin mastir KM. Dobmahin DM. Pinnir mahap PiM. Rinfir mastim RM. Punmahik PM. Xahos mahar XaM. Joknig mastip JM. Lamaster mastit LM. Wilmahil WM. Tibirim mahan TiMSticking with the same block.  KM  DM  Pim  RM  PM  XaM  JM  LM  WM  TiM  Further diminutionsTime always corrupts languages usually causing the names to be shortened. Most of these were the more complicated ones. There was a lot of effort by some of the other families not have their names shortened think Xeroxs attempt to save their name.. Kastir KM. Pinhap PiM. Joktip JM. Lamaster LMThe actual days didnt change.  KM  DM  Pim  RM  PM  XaM  JM  LM  WM  TiM  Bit of backroom politicsTarsan remains a patriarchy even to the events of the novels and Journals. Much of the marriage involves dowries. There are also trade agreements or exchanges of power. A number of these happened over the next century but we can include them in a single step. Lamaster lost a day to Tibirim mahan. Kasim mastir lost a day to Dobmahin. Wilmahil lost a day to Rinfir mastim.This results in the following block.  KM  DM  Pim  RM  PM  XaM  JM  LM  WM  TiM  Finally getting some partial daysOver a hundred fifty years after the desert clans figured out fall days Tarsan finally accepted that the year doesnt fit neatly in a given days. Actually it is well accepted that the idea was stolen from the desert cultures after the Fimchi Calculations but Tarsan had to do things their own way. Instead of two days losing one every four and one every eight they did something else. Moved the short months combined into one at the end of the year. The Xahos mahar is retained but the i is dropped. There is an additional day once every three years effectively adding . to the days.And the results..  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  XM . The lesser families gain powerOver the next century or so there were more battles and marriages shuffling around the days. As the lesser families gained power in the country their days were moved over to Xahos mahar.In addition Rinfir mastim was reduced to Rinfirm.. Kastir KM lost  days to XM. Dobmahin DM lost  days to XM. Rinfirm RM lost  days to XM. Punmahik PM lost  days to XM. Joktip JM lost  days to XM. Lamaster LM. Wilmahil WM. Xahos mahar XM gained  daysThis evened out the months a bit..  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  XM . The Tabrin WithdrawalThe Tabrin family a very small one with only a single estate on top of a mountain dedicated their life to observation of the sun and moon. After a number of decades they proposed a single to the calendar to bring it in line. Normally a change like this would be laughed out of the families but the Tabrin managed to pull of an amazing number of favors deals and ties that it was accepted almost unanimously. Remove two days from Xahos mahar every  years. . days.The Tabrin family didnt explain how they came up with this change. They refused to answer until the Tarsan great families decided to press the issue. They sent a contingent of a hundred warriors a rekihobehe to arrest the entire family only to find that every single member of the Tabrin family dead. Later investigations suggested that the Tabrin were killed before the proposal was ever made.Despite pressure to ignore the Tabrin changes it was accepted. In fact the final decision by the great families of Tarsan made a ruling that they would allow changes to the calendar by unanimous decision by all the members. This final calendar is what would become known as the Tarsan Standard Calendar..  KM  DM  RM  PM  JM  LM  WM  XM . Holidays and significant datesTarsan has a number of celebration days detsalci. In addition each family has their own holidays and special dates lazdetsalci which is celebrated both in the family and their cities identified with Ku family.Tarsan society as a whole is obsessed with correctness. This includes date. When a celebration day is established it is tracked against the correct day even across changes. This means that any date before the final change travels across the calendar a traveling date or litrudetri.,worldbuilding,cnbymv9,3,t5_2rd6n

2831686,0,t1_cnpmktd,I like these questions so in order..  Id assume with overabundant elements it would be like molding clay. If you have a huge chunk of clay it would be incredibly difficult to take pure clay as a whole and try kneading it to the point of use unless you were exceptionally strong or had the assistance of some sort of machine which now that I think about it is a neat idea in its own right. In order to mold it easily and freely one would have to go through the effort of tearing off an appropriatesized piece and softening it into a pliable form to be able to use it well. With specific elements like Mercury or Silver and the like as long as one has that instance of the element in their possession it will always be in their control and very easily so. Oxygen would be a tricky element as its an example of a finite resource of sorts. If one has to go through the motions of controlling the element that means there is a certain amount of oxygen around the user that is being controlled. And oxygen is the element that living things are constantly consuming. This means that unless the user is periodically refreshing their supply or reloading as it were they will actually run out of oxygen to use. So binding ones sight to oxygen would make one able to see  degrees around them but their area of vision would gradually narrow until they are once again blinded. Humans do have many more senses than the known  and more of the abstract senses would definitely be bindable.Bindable? Although the user would have to be very careful if they wanted to bind certain obscure senses to elements. For example it would be possible to bind your sense of Balance to a certain mineral or water etc which would make you very nimble and empowered when standing on or in said element no matter the incline or conditions but make you a complete klutz at best if you werent. At worst you probably wouldnt be able to even stand up or see straight. Again choosing Oxygen here would be tricky and unless you can already fly it wont be very useful just a nuisance.  Following your example Different senses would be affected differently. If Timmy were to go into an oxygenrich forest and meditate he would reach a state of supreme wisdom. However without a supply of controlled oxygen Timmy himself would be lost guided by the air around him almost via an external force. His ability to make decisions would manifest itself outside of his body. However if Timmys oxygen supply happened to be cut off it would turn a dire situation into something much more severe as suffocation would throw Timmy into the depths of insanity. If he were to survive it would probably take quite a bit of meditation to bring back a stable psyche. In essence common sense probably would be one of the better things to bind to oxygen given the nature of the sense. So bringing it back to  purely mental senses such as emotions did I mention I counted emotions as senses? Probably should have mentioned that. would probably be best to bind to elements that we are all surrounded by whereas practical senses such as sight and touch would be best of in specific cases. ...I wrote a lot more than I thought I would.

The idea is cool and I like it but Ive made an effort to split the river less and smooth the areas where one river joins another. On this scale there arent any sharp edges! From the rop down Ive redone the join up the top smoothed out two side connections and then moved the entrance to the lake. I get that you want a lake and an island so Ive kept that. The far right river now all sources from the one river rather than being a weird offshoot and having a connector which makes no sense. The most logical option would be to remove the lake and bit connected to it but thats no fun!.. Circled in white are some rivers that need smoother joins.. Circled in red Lower the road down to city height earlier methinks. Not only is it just more appealing but . As said Ive got some ideas specifically for that lower one circled in black.

I think that taking your two examples and putting them together would be an example of this can you imagine a situation where people working on robotics e.g. Mindstorms are tasked with building something that is set conceptually in a fictional world? Its a pretty easy step since of course many Mindstorms projects are in fact scifi etc.An extension of this is the idea of overlaid realities where as you move in our reality you may see an AR based overlay of another space  say a ruined far future version of your street or...? This is explored in Vernor Vinges fiction both as a short story commissioned by the IEEE and later as a full on book and is quite compelling. Things take place in the real and virtual spaces. People author where they feel they can make a contribution. I can see people doing world building covering the full range from this world engineering e.g. building a robot who cares what it is ultimately for through complete visioneering e.g. building a ruined cityscape and the why of that.Weve also talked in our group about musical spaces about myth making about videography ideas both for teaching and as part of world building...One of the things weve discussed... leading up to our first trial next year... is how to make groups for group work.

2965792,0,t3_2u3hwk, I did not intend for this to be so long and even this is a pretty abbreviated version of events. Apologies in advance. The Rose Lands were the domain of the great dragon Putter so nicknamed by dragons for her love of gardening. Her realm was immense compared to the realms of other dragons and she wanted to keep it that way and so ordered the construction of grand fortifications along its border.Fast forward  years after her death. The Rose Lands has been ruled by Putters human bureaucracy for  generations and has seen  rulers. Rulers are chosen by appointment the Holder of the Lands writes a list of  successors and keeps this list secret and locked away. The list can be edited at any time. Upon their death the list is read and the next successor is chosen who writes their own list.Holder Barve was a very old ruler. He was the equivalent of  years old using our time. He had written his list of successors decades ago and hadnt even thought about editing it until he realized that half the people on the list were dead.Panicking he spent many nights trying to figure out who should inherit his position. This attracted a great deal of attention from the lands powerful people who sent spies to try and find out who Barve had selected. The circles of high society were abuzz with gossip and speculation as to whom would be on the list. After some time it was eventually agreed that Argyn Piner a wealthy landholder and warm kind man would probably top the list.One night Barve had exhausted himself while worrying over the list and eventually retired to bed. But he had forgotten to lock the strongbox he normally kept the list in. And on that night it so happened that a spy whose name and employer remain unknown had snuck into his study finding the list and its contents.It did not take long for the news to let out Holder Barve hadnt altered the list at all out of indecision. As said half the people on the list were dead and four others were past the age of . The first in line and last in line were the only two who were not hopelessly senile my eldest grandson whomsoever he might be and Lorry Lonkit an orphan currently in the care of the nurses of the Garden Lair.The landholders of the realm were utterly outraged. For one the last four lists had included only the most competent and deserving people in the entire realm. But this list of Barves comprised of noone but old friends and family. The boy at the bottom of the list was just  years old.But more damning was that the person at the top of the list happened to be Rodney Redheart the Hereditary Ward of the Chalice Charge.The Chalice Charge was the richest and most powerful of the lands along the Drifting River a river that could be compared to a smaller version of from our world The Red Sea and Suez Canal. Its immense importance to trade and travel made the favour of its states highly contested by the two great lands that sandwiched it the Rose Lands and the Universal Hope.If Rodney were to become Holder of the Rose Lands while being Hereditary Ward of the Chalice Charge so long as he and his descendent continued to have healthy children of their family the two lands would be forever united. And almost assuredly Rodney would draw the Rose Lands into his war for control of the entire Drifting River area.For a land that had not seen conflict since even before the days it was ruled by a cruel dragon this had no appeal.Three distinct political camps formed around debate of the succession list.The first were those who only cared about the continued peace and prosperity of the realm. They wanted to bask in the comfort of their own little worlds and wanted to avoid armed conflict. They didnt care who was on the list so long as it was someone of the realm and of the same mindset as them. This was the most popular camp.The second camp were those who felt a complete overhaul of the system was necessary. This debacle had become proof that the Holders judgement could not always be trusted and that successors ought to be elected by the landholders of the realm.The last camp were those who felt that the list ought to remain unaltered either because they would somehow benefit from the unification of the Rose Lands and Chalice Charge because of loyalty to Holder Barve or due to the fear that if the Holders authority could be challenged by a big enough coalition over any matter then the realm could easily slip into anarchy.One landholder however had a unique opinion. Her name was Sky Piner the eldest daughter of Argyn Piner who had past away from a mysterious illness. Upon his death she inherited all his land and all the land he held in the stead of his deceased wife. This made her the single largest landholder in the Rose Lands.Sky Piner wasnt like most landholders. She was thirty years old had never taken a partner and had no children. She was known to practice dogma of the Universal Hope openly while the official hope of the realm was Reverent. She had constructed places of worship who were tended by men from the Universal Hope. She had numerous business interests in the Drifting Valley and was notoriously mean with coin.While her father was muchbeloved and the landholders understood well why he would entrust his lands to his intelligent daughter they nonetheless hated her guts. Combined with this open disdain and her religious beliefs Sky began collaborating with the Universal Hope. If they would help invade the realm and place her in charge of it she would sign the Universal Accord which would have the Rose Lands submit rights temporal and spiritual to the Chosen the leader of the Universal Hope.When all was ready she gathered an army of mercenaries and paid soldiers from her lands and met up with a large Universal army. As the fortifications along the border had not seen conflict by anyone who manned them the army smashed the apparentlynotimpregnable fortifications.Not days after this landmark event did Holder Barve finally pass away from a fatal case of knifeintheheart. He died in his study still working on the list. Upon inspection it showed that Rodney had been crossed off. The validity of this crossout was viewed with skepticism fracturing the already small third camp into three smaller camps of its own.Upon the death of the Holder the news of the list and the invasion of the realm by the Universal Hope and Sky Piner many of the first camp who had no taste for the war sided with the invaders hoping to avoid a serious war. However Rodney and his supporters in the third camp decided to invade the realm themselves. And those in the second camp were putting up a desperate defence of the realm.The longterm ramifications of Barves indecision were devastating. The realm was plunged into a war that is still burning hot with total casualties currently surpassing one million as five factions wage war for control of the Rose Lands. Landholders constantly change sides based on whoever they believe has the best chance of winning which only serves to make the war even longer and more complicated.  Rodney sacrificed most of his wealth and manpower in the war dooming his realm to being conquered by the Chalice Charges old rival the Beneficent Property who now hold a monopoly on the Drifting Valleys trade.  Trade on the eastern coast of the Rose Lands which depended heavily on the Drifiting Valley being a wartorn corrupt place dried up in the face of the iron fist the Beneficient Property placed on it. Regions of millions lost a quarter of their population and the opulent highly advanced city of ByTheSea became a desolate slum. With their troops so commited in the Rose Lands the Universal Hope had trouble enforcing the legal rulings of the Chosen resulting in numerous realms repudiating the Universal Accord. As the primary source of manpower along the border with the Dragons lands came from mercenaries paid for by the Universal Hope these men started to disappear. Land along the border has been lost to Conquerer who brings any state that stands in his way to utter ruin.Perhaps Barve was directly to blame for these events but perhaps not. Had the landholders shown more faith in Barves decision or had Rodney been assassinated in due time the war could have been avoided. Rodney could have simply forsook his claim but his greed wouldnt allow it. Had Sky not been so greedy herself a peaceful solution might have been reached.

2991019,0,t3_2tc10b,Excuse the lateness. I just found this interesting. Here are two.The Acadian Special Air Service Regiment Boreas was once attached to the British SAS and trained with them for some odd years after Acadias independence as a planet but now they are their own service and branched off accordingly. Counterterror unconventional warfare special reconnaissance ... they are the goto special forces for not only Acadia but most of the Federated Systems intelligence agencies and their handler Primary Human Intelligence. Very much like their name they come in like the cold complete their objective and leave with nary a draft. Some of their most famous feats include Operation Breadbasket  the evacuation of the Pheltic government and Operation Fish Flake  the capture of rogue Byota general Ilseha BeErinte. On the conventional battlefield they will be deep in enemy territory setting landing zones and disrupting supply lines. Only one out of six prospective troopers drawn from the already prestigious Acadian paratrooper corps Notus will pass training the others quit on their own volition. Equipment tends to be standard issue despite troopers freedom to choose their own equipment they just seem to like their KTCs. They are headquartered in Dunsboro Airbase near the regional hub of Sharps. Their motto is that of other SAS units Who Dares Wins.Special Warfare Detachment Tsavo from Zevoa is one of the more legendary commando units in Human space. First part Theyre not Human but uplifted Hyenas gnolls if you will formed before Zevoa was even a planet and was a stateless nation. Second part subtlety is not their main priority. If they find that driving through an enemy camp in pink jeeps and ventilating the commanders tent is more effective that waiting to snipe him they will do it. On the more conventional end of the special forces spectrum they specialize in direct action special reconnaissance and guerrilla warfare in support of conventional operations. Such objectives include supply line disruption assassination of highvalue targets and as an advance force for airborne and amphibious operations. As such they wear the standard issue Pictus camouflage and modified weapons such as suppressed M SCRs Robinson XCR upwards to the Microgun.Applicants come from the Zevoan Rangers and other army shock units and the concepts are nothing they havent seen before parachuting special driving techniques handtohand combat boat handling weapons handling diving ... but ridiculously more intense and with more finesse. Famous missions include the grounding of the Sholdan Fourth Internal Fleet preventing them from outright crushing the Pheltic rebellion and the capture of Dilodex tritium refinery on what would become Zevoa during the Twentyone Day War between the Federated Systems and the Muselath Coalition Yande Byota Coleesian and Sholdan forces operating jointly against the Federated Systems.

3011274,0,t1_coa1is1,My AI isnt really that selfdirected its basically just trying to figure out how to optimize everything so no one goes hungry or doesnt have a home and that society doesnt collapse. People can usually do what they want. If someone wants to build a home in a particular spot that is a marvel of engineering and architecture the AI will allocate resources and assist however it can as long as it is inline with the goals of the AI and the planet in general. Some other citizens may want to build or purchase a space ship to perform a scientific expedition so again the AI would have to figure out if it will be worthwhile and how to make it work  Where does the ship come from who builds it who gets a commission as captain what authority does that person have who gets commissioned as officers etc. It gets even more interesting when you add in people who want to work in government and feel like they are contributing  the AI has to try and find a role for them where they can contribute without harming the overall efficiency of the planet. The AI often offers suggestions to citizens to get them to contribute. If they do not the AI can usually make up for it  if someone wants to be a street sweeper but is really bad at it the AI will say okay heres a broom and then have a cleaning drone follow them discreetly to correct their errors. The only time the AI can override a citizen is if the citizen wants to do something or is doing something that harms another citizen or otherwise infringes on their rights. In this case the AI will either compel the citizen to cease their action through an official order or the AI has the authority to deploy law enforcement units.

Id give them a lighter shorter weapon so they can manage a substantial shield and then put a row of men behind them with long spears and bucklers or small shields that thrust out ahead of the first rank.  In fact with really long spears you could have additional rows of men behind the first rank of shieldbearers.  Something like a hoplite.gt ...they will all charge rapidly at the enemy before dropping the first rank on its knees shields in a wall allowing the second rank to cast a prepared barrage of throwing spears at a high velocity and at moderately close range.Unless you really wanted to target the front row of the enemy who will all have shields ready it seems unnecessary for the front row to kneel down.  As ive seen an atlatl used it should be rather easy to throw over standing soldiers.Look at it this way.  The enemy will already be prepared the best it can be for the long spears coming from right ahead.  It doesnt matter if they are surprised when the first rank kneels down they would defend from thrown spears from straight ahead in exactly the same way.  Better to have the thrown spears come at an angle from above so they are getting skewered from two directions.gt There also exists the CounterLunge. This is less reliant on formation and rather on strict discipline and the ability to hold ranks. During a melee the Grevian line will fake a withdrawal and a rollup of the flank.Thats a valid tactic and has been used historically but it relies on strong discipline and an unwary enemy.  It is a risky maneuver because without proper communication and discipline it can very easily turn into a real route.It is essentially a risky trick.  And if you repeatedly play the same trick people catch on and are not fooled.  I dont think it makes sense to have it as one of their two main maneuvers.,worldbuilding,cobcost,4,t5_2rd6n

It is also the responsibility of the creator to eliminate handwavium unless that is not an intention.Which is why I when I DM prefer to hew closer to reality. Its far far less labor to work out the rules of how a combat scene will work inside a tornado than it is on a normal street corner. Those setpieces are great when youve got the time to really develop them flesh them out and make them feel livedin. I often find Ill have a great idea but then the effort required to make that idea feel realistic AND relateable to players is prohibitive. Also ZakTH makes a good point about your players being overwhelmed.

3172847,0,t3_2wezok,My scifi world has a pretty scary one. The Nzumbe Collectiveor terrorists as theyre often referred to by outsiders worship an alien AI.At the start of humanitys great outward expansion to the stars lots of various religious sects went out looking for planets to inhabit and be left alone. If you had the money for a ship there wasnt much stopping you from picking a random star and going there. So this one group a fanatical group of religious transhumanists goes wayyyyyyyy out to the middle of unexplored space. They wander for years before finding a planet they can inhabit. Keep in mind theres no FTL communication so no one is really keeping track of these people. After a few months of building their modest colony they start finding evidence of structures beneath the surface of the planet. They begin drilling into these structures and exploring them. What they find is actually pretty uneventful. Concrete and steel tunnels connected in nonsensical ways full of nothing. Then they find a point where dozens of these tunnels connect. In the center of this is something that can only be described as an altar. Its very plain and the only thing on it is a simple metal cube.All the records show is that at some point one of the colonists managed to open the cube and interface with it using a computer. All the colonists except a few babies had cerebral implants installed and networked to each other.Fast forward a century. Everyone has forgotten about these people and everyone assumes theyre dead. Then at the edges of colonized space ships and small colonies start falling out of contact. A local patrol investigates a station they havent heard from in a while. As they arrive no contact no signs of life beyond the systems the station has automated. Theres a handful of ships docked in the hangar that look to be in a state of disrepair. The soldiers are quickly surrounded by ravenous cannibalistic and savagely violent people. Hundreds of them bearing their teethe carrying improvised melee weapons and a few firearms scattered among them. Every one of them has the distinct appearance of brain implants protruding from the sides of their skulls. Of the two dozen soldiers only seven make it off the station alive. For the next thousand years these attacks continue seemingly at random and steadily increasing in size. Then they simply stop. All attacks cease for as far as anyone can tell no reason. In the midst of all this conflict though a group rises. They call themselves the Nzumbe Collective. Theyre a religious cult obsessed with elevating humanity to its next level. Their goal is to network all of mankind with whatever it is that drove millions of people to bloodthirsty conquest. They havent been very successful but they remain a threat to all of mankind.,worldbuilding,coqv4hj,3,t5_2rd6n

3202537,0,t1_cotxmoe,gtHow did his recital not meet their standards? Was he not powerful enough to correctly perform the recital? If his anger supplemented his power by that much then why arent all mages rage mages? The first part is the bad luck. He simply choked and messed up. He thought too much and felt too little and fudged it. And that happens to the best of us. Its not the end of the world to most people. As for the emotional supplement to magic the important thing to remember is the age disparity between the students and the Masters they are old enough to know better. Rage is a powerful tool for catastrophic magical feats...but none of the Masters are interested in catastrophic magical feats. Theyre teachers not warriors. When they were younger they had their own fair share of accidents when their feelings got out of control. Once again this is chalked up to shit happens but the Masters learned from the shit and Habrian did not have that luxury.gtWhy didnt any of his Masters guide his research? Just taking our Universities today as an example During your final research or design project youll be in touch with your mentorinstructor almost every step of the way. Why wasnt this the case? Why was he allowed to have his research go unchecked?Conservatory was the first and only school of magic. As a result the most effective way to educate magic had not been solidified. There were four Masters three of whom are considerably aged for just over a hundred students. Supervision to the degree youre suggesting was impractical for such an early foray into magical education. It just wasnt really thought of or exercisisable as an idea. Additionally Habrian was not relying on his research to pull him through for the rank the only idea only acme to him after he fudged the Recital and so naturally he didnt feel inclined to share what he learned.gtFinally why didnt Habrian just wait the time required and test again? If he was so powerful already why didnt he just practice and practice and then blow everyone away with his amazing performance? Was he really that emotionally unstable? Did no one see this and think to talk to him? Didnt anyone try to console him and keep him from going homicidal?Unfortunately this one I have to handwave. Habrian was really just that unstable. Too much shit piled up onto an easily angered individual and he snapped. Its not the kind of thing anyone was expecting. Think of it was being equivalent to a schoolshooting you never know what the culprit is capable of until it happens and when youre asking Were they really that depressedhomicidalangry? the answer is yes they really were.,worldbuilding,cotxxug,7,t5_2rd6n

3216538,0,t3_2wxdxb,Mine is a superheroes world. So the telepaths will be highly vulnerable crippling countries intel and capacity to respond. We already have powermad supervillains all over the place and some of these claiming Otherwordly influence might go over peoples head much like real world North Korea and its empty threats. While Kingdom Breach has mighty heroes they certainly arent capable of slugging it out with the great old one. But small fish like the deep ones and nightgaunts etc should be easily handled. After that would then be all about piecing together the mad ramblings of the telepaths and since their words are highly valued people are likely to act under the assumption that yes Cthulhu is real and it is awakening. Maybe there is one person on Earth that can handle the threat. Well not exactly on Earth as she stays in orbit. Star Child a cosmic villain is largely occupied in keeping her battlemoon craft functional and wont be of much help however until she restores the seven wondrous artefacts that is scattered around the Earth. Well it probably isnt the best solution to fulfill the plan of one cosmic villain to handle another but at least Star Child speaks Earths language. One of the artefacts is already in her possession her faithful henchman Mr. Amazing on track to another. Another one is in possession by the US government and is being weaponised which might as well prove effective against the Great Old One at least to put him to sleep once more and another by a private corporate giant EScorp.So the Earths best shot on tackling Cthulhu will be as follows. Cross fingers that the US governments wonder weapon works and puts the great old one back to Rylieh or. Give the two of the artefacts to a cosmic villain so she can suppress Cthulhu hopefully. Neither of them bode well and the latter is likely to end up in enslavement of all humanity under a militaristic iron fist of a galactic general in a little girls body. So as cliche as it sounds the US government better up their game. P.s.  The seven wondrous artefact and the cosmic villain Star Child are my version of Marvel comics Thanos and his Infinity Gems. Basically things that can tear open the fabrics of very reality. Certainly something even a great old one will find cumbersome. ,worldbuilding,cove9p7,1,t5_2rd6n

It strikes me as the kind of backstory you find attached to a video game where the concept came first and then someone attached a copywriter to make sense of it.So basically the idea of an MFA is kind of cool but a frequent focus here is trying to make things especially plausible and coherent and I dont see how thats easily done here. For example How do they runsurvive on music? I can imagine that they might me programmed to react to music but as a power source music would be just about as wasteful a transmission as possible. Why not pay a few dimes and have themselves converted to battery power to escape the life of gladiatorial combat? Getting past that theres music everywhere. Why not gather under a bridge around a radio for an easy fix? Hang out in elevators or malls? Live in the alleys behind garage bands. Music is essentially a free infinitely reproducible resource  they should not be having trouble getting fed. Fully sentient sapient? childrens toys? Does that mean that theres lots of advanced AI around or are these the only example? If theres a lot around do other models take pity on their brethren? If not how did these make it to market before being yoinked by Darpa or bought up by some other developer? If they were so unstable how did they get to the th or th generation product line?

Glow weed is similar to marijuana only much more potent. When glow weed is burned it releases its spores into the smoke creating a glowing cloud of smoke that stays together for several minutes. The Trailblazers use this glowing smoke to guide travelers through the thick nightly fog of Green Marsh.Black Pine Sap  A favored treat of the Goblins. The effect of Black Pine Sap is like a combination alcohol and opium. Those who drink it besides Goblins enter a trancelike stupor their muscles relaxing completely and their mind going into a deep haze. Addiction comes on quickly again except for Goblins and withdrawal is so severe it has been known to kill those who attempt to get off the drug without proper care. Black Pine Sap is understandably outlawed in every nation except Skottan the Goblin homeland.Thorn Root Powder  The Thorn Root is an extremely strong plant that has adapted to and is the only plant able to grow in the salt plains of Guluk. When the plant is ground and ingested it gives the user a sickening euphoria and mild hallucinations. Its often used by Gnoll shaman to invoke blessings on hunting parties. Its outlawed by most nations.Gilderberry Wine  An extremely potent alcohol made by Caithe cat people wine makers for nobles. Gilderberry Wine is considered a drug because in addition to the normal alcohol effects it has severe hallucinatory effects. Its banned in every nation including Kaladen the nation of the Caithe because Gilderberries are poisonous in large doses. This however doesnt stop the Caithe from making it and smuggling it into other nations or nobility from drinking it.Black Flower Kelp  A drug favored by the Asrai merpeople. While being the mildest drug on this list its the most potent. Black Flower Kelp has an effect similar to cocaine infused with caffeine only much stronger and not nearly as addictive or deadly. While the Asrai sometimes eat small doses as a morning pickmeup other races find it too strong.

The Moon is likely thought to have been formed by a giant impacter and would therefore have sufficient mass to accrete material afterwards because it would have lots of gravitational pull to do so. Small ringlet particles if similar to the Saturnian rings would have size . to  m These do not have sufficient mass to come back together into one solid object. This is the premise behind the idea of a rubble pile for some asteroids.Its possible that on extremely long timescales something would form but certainly not on a  year timescale.One caveat Within Saturns Roche limit is the moon Pan.

The jungle would be far more western and between central Ehlhoc and the Osorol mountains would be Savanna. Also the western Herlet Arlaran would be dryer and western Maraun more humid and so on. Basically for it to be more realistic as I planned it or at least I think so all directions would have to be reversed. The reason for this mistake is probably because I am European and everyone orientates on what is familiar to them and the fact that I started with this world not organised bottoms up but just started to build stuff on each other without that much of organised planing. The Herlet Arlaran assumes the role of Europe in the setting I wouldnt call it PseudoEurope because it is not just a copy of medieval England France or Germany combined but the directions are reversed so obviously it would have another climate than I planned... Im currently thinking how I should solve this problem Im obviously not going to change everything I have made so perhaps the lazy excuse would be Well the planet turns into another direction than Earth the Sun rises in the West and sets in the East as I also work with conlangs in the setting I could excuse every reference to sunrise and sunset as a translation error.

Touch of madness  basically you contract and dont yourself from a taint of Corruption. Mechanically Corruption is part radiation disease and part blood pathogen. In the other words if you spend too much time in a corrupted place of which are several or eat the meat of a mutatedcorrupted animal you start going insane. On the upside you unlock your full potential at magic. On the downside you will either die or go completely insane if you arent careful or strong enough.. Cannibalism. You become slightly faster smarter and stronger dont need to drink and you only need to eat a couple of times a week. What sucks is that you cant eat normal food anymore  only human flesh works. As another upside you develop a couple of powers most of which are usable atwill. One of them is the ability to change your appearance into anyone. Another one is invisibility. Third one lets you channel a bit of energy through your attacks fire cold lightning acid. My favorite one allows you to teleport up to  ft more if youre runningsprinting and strike your target potentially killing them and if you kill them you can decide if you want to turn them into dust.. Surgically inserting weirdass gemstones into yourself. The gems are in essence Corruption granted physical form. Or not. Replace both your eyes and you will see through everything invisibility magical and regular darkness alike. Put it in your armhand and you will be much more precise while swinging weapons or shooting a bow. As a downside your lifespan gets drastically shorter with each gem.Worth mentioning is that the third option was last done before written history and that the second option is done only by a handful of people all of which are members of the same organization.And yes thats the short version. xDAlso first and last method have you end up as a zombiedemon on steroids after you die more often than not so you better have a backup plan for killing yourself after dying.,worldbuilding,cq79jd0,1,t5_2rd6n

Anything broadcast on it can be picked up anywhere in the universe. Recievers are cheap but transmitters are expensive. Its used for astronavigation reporting as quickly as possible the locations and vectors of all known objects so wormholes wont accidentally break things.The other is wormholes themselves. Normally ships create bridges between two points with some fancy calculations that alter the simulation underneath the universe. Ship created wormholes are temporary though.Communication satellites keep semipermenant wormholes open they have to be adjusted occasionally to other satellites and beam information through them via conventional means. You still have a longer lag time that beaming across the world but its only a few seconds difference.Also interesting to note here turn based games became really popular because of this.

A woman having sex without intending to become pregnant can be severely punished. A man participating in said act will most likely be exiled or worse so the male population have turned to each other for honkeytonkey. Needless to say half the population is manically criminal. Its like peeing in the shower lots of people do it but no one will admit it. Also if youre a person of prominence it is a social necessity to visit the brothels on a semiregular basis or someone may suspect you of doing... other things. The basis for the general sexual morale is that women are pure and men are incapable of anything but nasty thoughts and if they get too intimate physically or emotionally the purity of the woman is destroyed. ,worldbuilding,cqnl9yi,5,t5_2rd6n

The red round gem is inside the pommelthing under the grip a steel sphere with five windows the gem protrudes out of.Promethea is the demigod that all mages are descended from. Her emblem which is associated with them is three flames and three arrows radiating from the center. She is also a trickster with a longstanding but friendly rivalry with godemperor Vaharr often challenging his attempts to manipulate society with her own.The sword is of the highest quality made of a preciselymixed alloy with rare difficulttowork metals and shaped to perfection inside and out. It was forged not only with conventional tools but magically with Svarog directly manipulating heat and kinetic energy. A mage can use it to channel and focus his power Resheph has been able to magically repair itthe gem remembers its original form momentarily change its physical properties and shoot hydrogenfire from its edges.The Emperors Avatars are ornate animated suits of armor that Vaharr controls directly from afar and speaks through.

The manipulation of someones Thread LifeForce usually of someone who is dead Althougth their thread still survives due to being simply rewoven into a new mortal form in the Dark Realm and the Ethereal into a host body can produce identical copies if not outright creations of Gods whitch may or may not be ascendant to the Ethereal depending on the Gods wishes. Usually these sorts of creations wind up as Tann or Remnants of the Gods divine beings that are not of the Race of the gods themselves but are a product that in themselves may have divine powers or abilities either as a creation of the Gods or as an anomaly descended from the l The Old Ones or something else.In fact it has happened before. Bieshazi a prominent Demon Or FireBeing who somehow acquired some manner of divine power himself was a product of Necromancy done by The Sorcerers living deep in the bowels of the world and hiding there to this day to conceal their purposes and machinations. He himself began one of the major events leading up to the War of the Magi Name Pending known as the War of Madness which decimated much of Castavar Once a continent of forests now reduced to an ashen rocky steppe not unlike realworld Mongolia or Spain and destroyed an entire race of lman the lmanVl lman of the Night. He was eventually destroyed flawed in his divine form but The Sorcerers still exist deep underground.Theres also what the Gods do themselves to create new Gods or form new Avatars whitch has to be done manually at the Forge of Creation Creating an entirely new form and divine thread and attaching the two for eternity an incredibly difficult process.

Smart wizards leave out most of the evil. How the wizard formulates the demon determines its basic function. Demons are dedicated to the wizard who created them but they cant be made as obedient do anything I ask kind of servants. Instead they have to have duties such as guarding a road or keeping a river in its course hardwired in. They dont dare return to the place where they were created.

Only about a quarter of the worlds population couldnt use magic naturally anyone can technically perform magic but natural is vastly superior to artificial most of the time. A particularly ambitious godking managed to conquer all of the Old World and planned to make all nonmagic users into docile slaves through selective breeding. He destroyed anything and anywhere that had historical or cultural value to the formally diverse groups of nonmagic users to mold them into a single slave race. Children were separated from their parents by birth and indoctrinated into believing that they were destined to be obedient slaves.Insubordinate adults were severely punished but never executed and ratting out rebellious slaves was greatly rewarded usually with lightened workload pardoning of crimes improved living conditions access to brothels and other luxuries.This continued without any major hiccups a thousand years after the original kings death until the current king became a bit too brutal to the slave race. Instead of persuading slaves into being obedient like with luxury incentives and such the current king was quite the sadist and slaughtered slaves practically at random for little to no reason increased the workload to absurd lengths intentionally induced mass famines and sometimes forced slaves to rape murder and even eat each other for entertainment.A particular slave eventually snapped and would later incite a global rebellion that would cost  of the slave population. With help from the unconquered New World she enhanced her brain to use extremely powerful artificial magic and was able to kill the king and dismantle the empire but died a few years after from the magic disintegrating her brain but not before having a child who incidentally inherited the artificial magic that would eventually evolve into natural magic effectively making it so that everyone can use natural magic in the modern era.TLDR A quarter of the population couldnt use magic were enslaved for a thousand years rebelled and then became able to use magic.,worldbuilding,cr02zdz,1,t5_2rd6n

Most notable Star Trek tended to mess up here by turning all alien races into monocultures. Space is really freaking big tracking someone down outside the borders of a faction is difficult. In the same vein planets arent treated like cities good luck finding someone there. Many SF showsstories depict this as far too easy. Humansaliens need to take precautions when they travel to another world. In most cases they cant just walk around in their casual attire like we see in pretty much every SF setting this was wonderfully lampshaded in Galaxy Quest.  Ive got aliens who figure out emotions without having humans explain it all to them. Hell the first biomechanical creature to make contact with humanity is putting his past experiences with other alien species to use.  I make full use of the D nature of space. Spaceship attacks can come from any direction for instance.

4004390,0,t3_36bkx9,I have two or three ways I like to proceed when abandoning a project Simply dont look at it for a while. My first project was an awfully drawn dragon balls knockoff and Im sure it is lying around somewhere still but I got tired of the structure imposed by dragon ball and because of that abandoned the project pretty much after the first story ark. Now it is fun to revisit it and read it once again but I would never continue it. Incorporate it into another project. While this works best with small side projects it might work on a grander scale too if done correctly. Take what makes the world or setting interesting and try to fit it into anoter one of your settings. My current Fantasy project has assimilated ar least four of my older and several younger projects over the time. This has lead e.g. to it having a very fleshed out recent history since I tend to use stories I didnt flesh out enough into historical events. Simply put it on halt. Working on other stuff doesnt mean you have to abandon your old ones completely and sometimes you will stumble upon an idea that will greatly improve an older project. At the beginnig of my current project I had a race of mary sueauthor avatars one of the worst cliches in my opinion and after I decided to let the project sit for a while I came up with a species that could fit the same purpose in the setting yet were much more interesting and varied.,worldbuilding,crcqch7,3,t5_2rd6n

How much it aged you depended on the severity of the crimes and how much the judge disliked you and it was possible to commit so many crimes that youd be sentenced to  years consecutively and be aged into dust.Also technically it was your youth being siphoned away rather than your body being aged so the captured lifeforce would then be employed by the governments in experiments creating golems or other magical servants who need a driving force or deaging elderly Magisters.,worldbuilding,crd5qu8,2,t5_2rd6n

I think there CAN be issues of lack of perspective in some cases in either direction but I feel thats more an artifact of individual author empathy rather than anything particularly related to the actual genders of the author and subject. Also when I have noticed obvious issues onedimensional characterizations backdrop personae etc it usually means that samegendered characters are also less well rounded or characterized.

Any apprentice can learn the worlds to a spell that would reduce a dragon to a pile of bones but without the proper training in pulling energy from the mana pools the spell will be extremely ineffective and leave them fatigued. The more powerful the spell the more energy needs to be pulled which puts greater and greater stress on a persons body this is why in my world the Archmage has near god like strength but is in very poor health and has before physically weak due to decades of weaving incredible spells. Dark magics such as necromancy or demon summoning and binding require drawing energy from other living things mostly animals or in the case of larger spells the sacrifice of people. Dark spells leave a sort of residue that can be tracked by trained mages or paladins.

Theyd both get days and nights its just that one sides day would be warmer than the others.If the whole planet were habitable no reason you cant make it that way a high eccentricity would really just mean the two halves would have different climates  possibly like the difference between the temperatearctic climates and the tropics. Making the overall temperature hotter and the center of the side which is day during periapsis might be too hot to live in  like the Sahara or worse.

PHeres an idea for you where do they get their food from assuming its really cold up there? I assume agriculture is possible but only some crops are going to work when growing seasons are so short. Furthermore they dont have that much land to work with in the first place. So theyre going to be fishermen as well as farmers. Theyre also going to be dependent on the oceans for trade and communications since youll need a ferry to move stuff and people between the islands. My point here is that theyre going to have a really strong seafaring tradition and its worth working with that.They might also be really good traders since they dont have much on their islands. Their seafaring tradition is going to be a big help here. They may have technological innovations relevant to these sorts of endeavours. For example the sextant and compass might be invented here. Theyll have a good understanding of the stars. To say nothing of innovative sailing ships  perhaps something like the fluyt Trading will also influence their culture and government.

Its actually part of a Cthulhuesque mythos that Im creating where several elder gods  actually inhabitants of the highest dimension Amarvathi the mythical city of forms from which all things are derived from and to which all things return to  attempt to bring about the end of the world.  The world is pretty much the same as our current modern world but with the transdimensional stuff overlain on top of it.  It diverges when an international conspiracy discovers the existence of said transdimensionalism and begins researching this technology.  Amongst the many new things they develop is the slipshifter a small device that can create a small spacetime bubble that allows an individual to travel up or down the Akashic ladder.  This leads to the discovery of the sigils even more tech such as new fields of mathematics hyperdimensional computing resonance engineering and so on and eventually slow realisation that the elder gods are awakening.As above so below. The alchemists of the Middle Ages have always known of this truth but for so long we have turned a blind eye to their lore and knowledge. Very well then. Today I renounce my learning and embrace my ignorance that I may learn how to unlearn truth.As above so below. Every action on a higher plane reverberates through every layer of the multiverse and its effects are felt on every dimension beneath it. Causality is not an arrow racing through spacetime. It is a flower whose petals touch the different layers of reality an open blossom that slowly folds upon itself in slowmotion until it is a bud of raw potential once more.Causality is nonlinear. I open my hand and the glass shatters on the floor. A causes B. Looked at from another angle however I can also say that the glass shattering on the floor caused my hand to open. B causes A. The two events are inextricably linked and it makes no sense to say that just because A came before B A must have caused B.  Post hoc ergo propter hoc.Im not explaining this very well.  No matter.  Suffice to say that Hume was right we can make no inductive inference about the world around us not when causality spans multiple dimensions.  Idappaccayata when this is that is.

4185079,0,t1_crx6v9i,RoboticphishI thoroughly enjoyed your comments. I think you hit the nail on the head with each one.  One of the most exciting things about this world is that nothing is perfect or clean so of course there is a lot of room for the characters to make a lot of mistakes. None of the characters are good or bad to the core the are in constant flux and so that allows for the characters to be very flexible specially in the dreamworld. . The Loligi have a backstory as well. They use mermaids as lanterns basically so there is a strange symbiosis there it will be explored more in depth. But I will say this the most ferocious creatures in the dreamworld are never the most dangerous.. There is a substance in the dreamworld called Mirth. This substance can have the power to grant you limitless abilities for a short burst of time. But it has to be mixed properly by an alchemist. The issue is the more you consume it the more you want to be in slumberland and the more you stay in slumberland the more your conscious self decomposes and transforms into something else entirely. You lose yourself in the dream. Ever wonder why Albert Einstein was so smart or how Wayne Gretkzy was so damn talented on the ice? They found the Mirth in their dreams and they figured out how to exploit it. That power is available to anyone. Just beware.. . The thesis of the show is to establish alternate realities but honestly it is not my interest to spoon feed answers to the viewers. I will tell you this if you were to dream for a long long time to the point where you forgot your awake state how would you know you are dreaming? Could it happen the other way around?. You are teasing me and I almost fell for it... youll have to watch.. Part of the challenge for me is that this story takes place in the intersection of Genres. It really is a bit like the Matrix and it also really is a bit never ending story I believe this is something quite new. I am fascinating by shining a light at that exact crossroad. What sort of things happen in each world dont really excite me as the thought of what happens at the intersections of these two realities. You know the exact moment where they collide.

4219241,0,t3_3963rb,The major religion of Hairothar is a sort of militant gnosticism that considers anything having to do with the physical body to be evil. Hence they have a kind of stereotypically Victorian view of every body function. Including eating. This makes social situations very different from ours. Meals all tend to be buffet style and people usually dont interact while eating. Leaving the room to belch or fart is common even amongst intimate company. And sex... well lets just say there is a huge culture of public shame and reactionary private depravity. Some of it involving food.There is also a perverse tension between the drive to shame people for being fat which is connected to excessive living and for being physically fit which is considered to be vain and selfindulgent for a completely different reason. Soldiers for instance are given a special indulgence from the clergy because of the obvious need for physical fitness in their profession. The officially sanctioned ideal body is basically what the internet has been calling the dadbod recently. Note I came up with this years ago I was in no way inspired by the dadbod becoming a trending term on the internet.Bathing is an interesting case. There are those who consider it to be a necessary ritual cleansing ones self of the evil of dirt and stench. Others consider it to be an indulgence of the flesh. Fortunately mostly out of necessessity the former is the dominant view and the latter are colloquially referred to as stinking brothers. But even in the mainstream view bathing is still a taboo activity. You would no more discuss the removal of dirt from the exterior of your body than you would discuss the purging of waste from its interior.,worldbuilding,cs16cfp,2,t5_2rd6n

4360139,0,t3_3avjda,It comes down to two characters here for me.First is Nilren Eshaldell shes a Gihemdur a prosperous darkskinned elf from space with horns made from stars sort of race with a culture of nice clothes food and general friendliness woman who left her homeland Felenora to travel east and ended up in the house of a Lorthiran noble Lorthir being a cold snowy norseinspired land originally settled by a spinoff group of farmers and laborers from the first human civilization a couple thousand years ago and experiences all sorts of racism and prejudice but ultimately ends up being pretty happy in Lorthir. Shes not a major character by any means her story is very uneventful by the standards of my world but I like her nonetheless. At one point I considered making her more important and slotting her into one of my bigger stories but decided I liked her better as a minor relatively inconsequential character from a sidestory and shes also a neat worldbuilding tool since her story says a lot about Lorthir and Felenora which are my two favorite nations in my world.The other is Feilyn Shen whos definitely much more interesting and easily my most fleshedout character. Shes an Erulie Nahaski shes from a Nahaski tribe thats biologically Erulie with elements of both cultures wandererturnedmercenaryturnedwarlord who spent years wandering the deserts of Nahask honing her skills with the sword and learning about the culture of the land. After a very long series of events involving and ending in the defeat of Amarn Addana a pseudoreincarnation of the ancient warlord and cult leader Ksamkarth she becomes set on uniting the lands of Imass that is Erul and Nahask among a few other smaller nations to defend against the threat of the Lyanden Empire which is a really big mishmash of races and cultures lead by the ambitious Tarnis Quen and which rules the whole southern part of the Aureate Peninsula.Shes the main protagonist of one of the two big stories I want to tell and her story evolves over time from a personal tale of a wanderer with no direction or purpose who ends up seeking an ancient warlord and his reincarnation then to her finding purpose in the unification of the two lands she considers herself to belong to against a common enemy and the grander scale of the war that ensues from that. Shes really damn close to being a villain and I think she would be one if her story was told from an outsiders perspective but obviously things arent that simple and thats whats cool about her as a character.Unfortunately Im not a great writer and all I have is concepts which I find very hard to describe properly so most of this is probably just incoherent rambling and I apologize if any of it is poorlywritten.Ill happily clarify on anything if Ive managed to write nonsense instead of proper English at any point or if anyone has any questions about my world.,worldbuilding,csh4di5,2,t5_2rd6n

4412086,0,t1_csmsqbf,Ooooooh I think youre onto something. Also you got me to write something about Marid which is at the end of this post because itd be super intrusive if it wasnt.Your idea of participatory authoritarianism has a strong historical basis. I recommend you read The Call From Algeria Third Worldism Revolution and the Turn to Islam by Robert Malley for a particular historical example. He talks about this kind of regime in the Middle East generally and Algeria in particular. It doesnt exactly match your technocratic society but its definitely a form of authoritarianism which enjoyed massive popular support. There may be some lessons there.Though I suspect your history is off I understand what you mean. I agree it seems to me that a security environment like this one rewards strong social cohesion and active political participation. This suggests that the bar is set much higher for governments in this universe than it is in ours and it also suggests that nonliberal nonauthoritarian regime types do better than either liberals or classical authoritarians.In case youre asking didnt he just exclude the whole political spectrum Im using a particular definition of authoritarianism. A distinction between totalitarianism and authoritarianism will help an authoritarian will demand that citizens be passive and receive direction from the state and not speak up. In contrast a totalitarian will demand public participation on his terms sometimes at gunpoint  hence this sort of thingSo authoritarian systems will have to move towards either totalitarianism which being radically nasty and probably unsustainable is great for the occasional villain but will probably never be a standard or a form of participatory authoritarianism. Meanwhile liberalism also has problems. If it wants to keep its principles itll need to incorporate collectivist elements to encourage public participation such as a religious dimension or a strong affirmation of certain values Alternatively direct democracy might be more common at least at lower levels or in a limited form to encourage public participation. You just nuked the traditional political spectrum and I thank you for it.After all hard security on a mass level is probably incompatible with liberal values and any authoritarian state that tries to suppress its people en masse will probably fall apart eventually.Separating discussion of Marid in particular because its less relevant but keeping it because you may find it interesting.Participatory authoritarianism is definitely the inspiration for Marids government type. After the coup detat executed by Colonel Fatima Khan comes the Emergency Regime under Grand Admiral Fatima Khan comes the Empire under Her Imperial Majesty the Sultanah Fatima Khan. The Imperial regime isnt a democracy as Im sure you guessed but it is participatory as described in this thread the population is split into different sector groups which selfrule to some extent under state supervision and are guaranteed representation in the Shura parliament which appoints the Monarch excluding Fatima of course. Theres a ruling class distinguished by stategranted nonhereditary titles which are granted for state service.I agree with your assessment that this regime would be maintained by appealing to the peoples selfinterest. As youve indicated itd be a risk of economics security and religion  Ive explored all three. The Empire is ultimately a product of the robotic revolution which brought about weak and strong AI and earns a lot of its support from how its able to manage that transition in a way that guarantees people still have jobs. It also won a war and maintains itself as a superpower internationally hence a security arrangement. As for religion it gets pretty complex.I have in mind that religion becomes a metaphor for social cohesion in a country which under pseudodemocratic rule did not enjoy unity or responsible governance. This takes on a unique form. On one hand the Imperial Constitution states that the source of all law is the compassion and wisdom of the sharia and the state is inspired by the majesty of the Islamic tradition but it also guarantees freedom of worship and nonworship and explicitly forbids the ulema Islamic clerics from making laws or enforcing their opinions with some limited exceptions where people consent to the jurisdiction of an Islamic judge.

4435172,0,t3_3buvky,First of all villain  antagonist.Its entirely possible to have a heroic character as an antagonist because it depends entirely on who your story is following so Ill treat the two separately. The antagonist simply needs to have goals that cause them to come into conflict with your protagonist whoever that is. Think about who youre writing as and if shes just a general figure then park the antagonist side of things for now.Which just leaves her credentials as a villain. Youve got to give your audience reason to view her as such. Dont just tell us that shes not to be trusted give us a scenario where she double crosses someone. Dont tell us shes powerful and influential depict her as sitting at a centre of a web of connections and then go on to show how she might use them. And lastly toss in a few horror stories. Make her pressure a kids hospital into closing because it was affecting her business or ruin a reputable businessperson because they offended her at a soiree. Whatever showcases her character flaws that make her a villain. The nuance and the backstory can come later.,worldbuilding,cspqn4c,9,t5_2rd6n

4486031,0,t3_3cjo3w,General Outbreak HistoryThe virus began somewhere in the archipelagos of the Philippines and Indonesia. It acted fast and it spread wildly. Time between first contact to the virus to full on infection was no more than  minutes in individuals. Several islands became completely infected within a matter of days. The governments of the world saw the destruction and chaos this virus posed and almost all commercial flights were grounded within just  days after initial outbreak. Before this grounding any commercial plane that had infected passengers had crashed due to the very limited time it took for an individual to become fully infected.The transmission of the virus from landmass to landmass was now solely being carried out by boats. As boats were able to float through open ocean without the need for a healthy human being to guide it it became the primary source of transmission on a large scale. Later on these boats were referred to as Ghost ships. The virus was essentially island hopping by the first week. It gave the rest of the worlds nations time to prepare for the impending global outbreak. It didnt take long before Europe Africa and Asia were now at great risk with a ghost ship crashing into the shores of Vietnam. The virus spread quickly to the north towards mainland China and west to India. US troops in the Middle East were now being sent home immediately to support a nationwide effort to isolate the United States from the rest of the world. The Middle East became a sort of buffer zone for Europe and Africa. Contingency plans were being drafted military troops were being rerouted and most of the eastern world in disarray. Russia could do little to keep its borders in check. With a large borderline to protect it chose instead to protect its major cities leaving the less populated areas to fend for themselves. Russian government was prepared to use whatever is necessary to maintain continuity of government. Fear of nuclear action spreads.China essentially falls as its government loses control of its populace and even its military. India suffers even worse without an adequately powerful military. The world witnesses firsthand the effects of such a devastating and fast acting virus on a world superpower. The population density of both countries are effectively being used against them. Talks between the governments of the United States Mexico Canada and Caribbean nations are being held drafting up a possible agreement. The US offers to provide full protection to the Canadian shoreline and MexicoGuatemala border in exchange for being annexed by the United States with the purpose of the protection of the North American continent. Similar and separate talks are being held with Panama. The US blatantly ignores communication with the UN to focus on domestic safety. The virus continues to blaze through India and China. Later on infecting Pakistan Tajikistan and Kazakhstan. Infection time becomes slower with each individual becoming completely infected up to  hour of initial exposure. Ghost ships hit Oman Somalia Papua New Guinea and Australia. South East Asia begins to crumble. Negotiations in the UN begin to turn sour outside of Europe as many countries are beginning to cut off contact realizing that they have little to gain from further cooperation. The infection continues to spread westward across Africa and the middle east. The virus quickly travels across Saudi Arabia from Oman. The virus spreads northward into Russia but at a slower pace than expected possibly due to the Russian winter. Russian locals blame the government for their choice to abandon smaller towns and cities stating that the infection could have been kept from spreading into Russian soil. The UN and EU form a military coalition later referred to as the UNEU coalition. month after initial outbreak.Russia had given the UNEU authority to move military assets to the area between the Caspian and Black sea using Volgograd as their base of operations in an effort to choke the infection and keep it at bay as the WHO and other private and public health organizations are working ceaselessly to find a vaccine or cure to the virus. Turkey has given permission to the UNEU to use Istanbul for similar reasons in exchange for its citizens to migrate to European nations for their safety. Europes Mediterranean shoreline was now equipped to deal with ghost ships in the likely event that the African continent was to fall. Europes crude plan to keep the Infection at bay seemed to be holding out. As walls were being erected and troops were being posted. All they had to do now was to wait. Meanwhile Russia changes its plans to protect major cities across the motherland and instead erects its own walls across the Volga River in an effort to protect the capital city Moscow and its key government personnel. All Russian military has been ordered to move to the west. With the might of the Russian army ready to protect a relatively small stretch of land people around the world have dubbed it as the Volga River Curtain. The Volga River Curtain follows along the Volga River and meets with the main UNEU Coalition at Volgograd and continues downwards towards Astrakhan a city near the shores of the Caspian Sea. From there the EUUN Coalitions border begins from Astrakhan to Novorossiysk a City near the shores of the Black sea and is dubbed the Black Caspian Border.Talks between the US Canada Mexico and Caribbean nations are going well and measures are being taken to ensure that ghost ships from the pacific will not undo any of their hard work. A blockade is set across the pacific shoreline to inspect every ship that passes by and quarantines passengers before allowing them access into the US Canada or Mexico. A similar blockade is being formed for the Atlantic shoreline as large populations continue to trickle in from Europe and Africa. The US continues with negotiations with the Caribbean Nations such as Jamaica Haiti Cuba and Dominican Republic. With plans of using their seaports for support for the Atlantic blockade.Talks between the US and Panama are turning sour with the US offering to provide protection to only half the country making a preliminary border at the Panama Canal.Sudan and Egypt falls along with Australia. New Zealand Japan Taiwan are infected as well. Fears of ghost ships from the pacific grows and the Annexation talks finally grow to a close the new country is still being referred to as the USA but is officially named the UNAN United North American Nations. The US finishes up on militarization of key assets. Multiple factories across the country have been converted for the production of arms for the war effort. US troops move across Mexico as the Mexican authorities order all residents from the east of Salina Cruz city to move west to safer ground. A new border is being created at one of the narrowest stretches of land in Mexico to be served as a chokepoint in the event that South America falls. Immigrants from Central American countries flow into the UNAN in seek of refuge knowing that their own country stands little chance of defending itself from the pandemic. Delegates from former Mexico and Canada vote for allowing refugees to enter despite the unwillingness of the delegates from the former United States. The Atlantic fleet has been given full access to use ship ports in the Caribbean for restocking and refuelling. Forward operating bases spring up all over the UNAN cities near the coasts ready to quell any breach in the system. Weeks after initial outbreak.Much of the eastern African continent has fallen as well as almost every Asian nation. The UNAN Pacific Fleet has had its first encounter with a ghost ship which originated in Japan. The Volga River Curtain comes into contact with the first wave of infected just north of Volgograd. The first wave gives the Russian military its first glimpse into this new form of biological warfare. Turkish immigrants have managed to successfully move into the EU Territories housing and residences are managed by the UN. The Istanbul border has now been reinforced and so have the shorelines of the Caspian and Black sea. Iraq Pakistan and Afghanistan falls leaving Iran completely surrounded.Meanwhile The UNAN finalizes its plans for the Atlantic blockade with every ship having full access to the seaports in the Caribbean nations. Talks between the former US and Panama have finally come to a close with Panama allowing the US to construct a border at the Canal. The Pacific fleet has been stretched and now accommodates the shorelines of Guatemala to Panama.,worldbuilding,csw4lnw,8,t5_2rd6n
4487844,0,t3_3cj6hs,His name is lost to history but in Rhuen Totarai in the year y during the coronation ceremony of King Tszhinn III a young man in the crowd gathered around the royal balcony held up a small wooden sign that read Down with the king! Up with the people!. For this small act of protest he was shot and killed immediately by one of the royal guards flanking the King on the new Kings direct orders.His death was the spark that set the tinder of revolution aflame. Years of royal abuses had taken its toll on the Totari people and there was a sizable underground democracy movement mostly consisting of bookish intellectuals. The angry crowd charged against the Royal Palace resulting in a civilian massacre which only added more fuel to the fire. Within a week the king had been overthrown and executed and a new revolutionary government was in the process of being formed.The Totari Revolution set of similar feelings off dissent in other parts of Ekera and around the world A wave of antimonarch rebellions that changed the world forever.

Perhaps equipment resources soldiers for keeping order as well as laser satellites to destroy debris in orbit could be shipped out from the Martian colonies to aid Earth.In my world Humanity does also suffer a major invasion but only to Earth directly. Nearby colonies Mars Jovian moons Venus were able to scramble resources to minimize the chaos on the surface while slower ships collected and salvaged debris  both human and alien alike in order to make necessary repairs.

Yes but they often serve different purposes.  MaskedExchange is the most common outside of TechTalk.  It is a trade language to be used in all known worlds in the Dominion the largest Sphere of Influence.  It is meant to be an incomplete language because the people who invented it and the people they teach it too have a natural ability to quickly learn new languages.  The reason for making this trade language even though UTs already existed is because not everyone has easy access to the Technocracy.  MaskedExchanged is however one of the languages that is in the UT database.The most common People in Orion are naturally good at learning new languages and live very short life spans.

4532416,0,t1_ct1lv51,gtWell the only two lenses you can look at this discussion is from eiter a legal or a moral perspective. The legal view falls short since the very thing we discuss  nonhuman beings with an intellect on par with humans  is not covered by the law while regarding the moral one you seem to assume animal people are animals while i assume they are people. Im still wondering how this escalated into a discussion about bestiality.The legal aspect does cover it. Bestiality is legal in certain places. In others it remains illegal.Again again theres no mention of people in bestiality. If you have sex with a horse its bestiality. If youre OK with that as long as the horse is intelligent I have nothing further to say.gtChimps may be able to count but can you teach one wich of those colorful pieces of paper is the one dollar note an wich one is the one hundred? Also can all chimps reliably perform as well? It does not do the matter justice to compare the einsteins of an animal species to the one idiot human.Reliably perform? Im having trouble understanding your points as their goals get more and more specific and unintuitive to understand. Why would it matter if a whole animal species wasnt intelligent enough if one subject was considering you admitted it was questionable to have sex with retards?To frame it more simply if a chimp could read money and perform reliably would you have sex with it?gtWhat you are writing about morality proves my point. Your sense of morality is shaped by the society you grew up in. I dont think I have the right to judge that our moral system is better than theirs but it clearly differs. We for example consider racism wrong something that was completely normal back then while many people back then considered homosexuality wrong.My sense of morality has very little to do with the society I grew up in and who are you to assume this about me? Whats more how what I said proves your point is beyond me. If you think there is no morality at all then yes bestiality is as fine as anything else.gtDo you have a problem with animal races because they dont look human? In the original myth centaurs were abducting women to procreate so they clearly are some subspecies of human too by that logic. My point was that current definitions fall flat when trying to argue about multiple intelligent species sharing a world simply because there is at the moment no need to have a definition for nonhuman nonanimalsWell I dont want to have sex with horses. If someone does want to have sex with horses there is therapy for it. If you want to have sex with a human who looks like a horse perhaps opting for surgery to look more horselike there is also therapy for that.Youre saying abducting women and raping them is conductive to proving worthy of sexual relations? The fact they needed to kidnap and rape women is a good sign procreating with centaurs is not a good idea. Bulls also raped prostitutes to death in the Roman arenas as entertainment but it has little bearing on the acceptability of bulls except in the negative sense. The Greek myths of centaurs kidnapping and raping women is a precursor to those creatures from the Cthlhu mythos whatever they were called who kidnapped and raped women so they could bear weird offspring.gtIf having sex with either one often resulted in death injury or deadly STDs afterwards then there would be some similarities to horses.gtSo its bestiality if a halfling has sex with a human? even if they are supposedly of the same species I mean anatomy implies that there should be complications. How is your stance on satyrs as they are anatomically compatible and not a single case of an std transferred from a satyr to a human is known.What? Im not even sure how what youre saying is meant to be a response to what you quoted. And the sarcastic point that no satyr STDs have been recorded is proving I am wasting my time arguing this with you.gtNo the furry argument is but this specific animal is... by the same logic you employ in your arguments about animals being persons that would even become its ok to fuck animals because this one... while mine is this specific species is... You arent not human just because you cant function like a averange one but the other way around you arent becoming human just because you are an outlier for your species. You might be granted special rights but you arent a human. If a whole species however meets the guidelines that dont exist in real life yadda yadda... it should be considered not an animal wich at the moment for the lack of a proper term means human. If you want you may call them centaur for all I care but that furthers the discussion in no way because we then are back at the start.Umm... what? Do you know many furries? Of the ones Ive known I havent heard an argument like what you described that certain animals are OK. Youre becoming increasingly incoherent and are not responding to what Ive been saying misrepresenting what I said before with your own views.I said I consider animals people yes. Therefore by my logic I think its OK to have sex with animals? No that is your logic. By your logic its OK to beat your wives and do other heinous things if society allows it which I consider a heinous morality. But if that is your moral viewpoint either dont argue with me and encourage me because my new societys morality is as good as yours or agree that youre trying to enforce your morality on other societies because why else would you argue for yours when all moralities are equal?Your last argument is strange. If a man was missing his head would he still be a human? There are babies born without heads. If he isnt human after losing his head in an accident then a lack of function does stop something from being human. If it isnt acceptable to have sex with him after he lost his head assuming he gave prior consent then he has lost that human right associated with sex. And your argument about species is simply racist that if the majority is X then all must be treated like X rather than on an individual basis. If there was one centaur in existence and people assumed it was an offshoot of horses it wouldnt be OK to have sex with it because its alone so that it species dies out when it would be OK if there were many centaurs? Thats just a flawed senseless morality but since your belief is all moralities are equal you should support me in that belief or agree that your goal is to convert other equal moralities to yours.You can answer yes or no if dogs and horses were intelligent would you consider it fine to have sex with them? If yes I have nothing further I wish to say. If no then apparently you dont agree with that comic you posted. Ive said all I think I can say on this subject.,worldbuilding,ct1y1k0,1,t5_2rd6n

The Highly Attractive part is mostly accurate at least in the case of the Nymph. The Mermaid half is vaguely human so vaguely attractive. Nymph flesh is actually a powerful aphrodisiac that includes a lovely dose of hallucinogens so its understandable. Theyre still intelligent though so obviously its pretty bad.The Tarrasque in Ageon is actually very close to what the DampD version is but as a slowly reproducing species. It does have the trademark regenerative abilities but due to Ageons magic simply being a set of laws that allow creatures to function its regeneration is stopped by a type of weapon for a small amount of time which allows it to be harvested.A Lisjask is something Im actually pretty comfortable sharing its effectively an intelligent sapient giant centipede.

These three massive walls span the gaps between three rivers in a roughly circular line providing a barrier so formidable that not even the Senullan Empire ever breached it. While youre there well also stop by the Fountain of the Soul a truly magnificent work of art at the exact center of the continent and a holy site for followers of the Taneko religion. This fountain is designed in a way that perfectly harmonizes the four Elements of Creation Sea Wind Flame and Ice in a tribute to the creative soul and the Hidden Ones power. Feeling adventurous? Then you may want to look off the beaten pathsthe Senullan Lowroads run beneath your feet everywhere on Shipato and you might stumble upon a secret entrance! Once a bustling travel system for swift movement across the old Empire the roads are now a twisted maze of passages unknown to all but a select few. Who knows where youll end up or if youll find any entrance at all? Leaving Shipato for lands further windward north on Bazeerah we will hop on a vahial and trek into the desert. There far from the bustling coasts youll find the colossi known as The Pairtwo massive human figures one male and one female holding hands. Legends across Taijian state that this was the exact point where the first two humans arose. Whether or not this is true The Pair is truly a sight to behold. Further windward the continent of Szlaritoma is devoid of all life after the Sunstrike obliterated everything on it but going further beyond that well hit the frigid land of Kitano. The Jian Peninsula relatively temperate compared to the rest of the continent is the home of the Jian Estuary where Kitanos sole river meets the sea. The native Cetinoo peoples gather here once each year in the darkest part of the cold season and have extensively decorated the banks of the river in this area with tribal symbols religious effigies and other artistic works. If youre there during the gathering period you will also be greeted with the lights of a thousand fires the sounds of Cetinoo music and a massive carving of the face of an unknown god that spans the river and has fires lighting up its eyes. One continent remainsthe far seaward western continent of Huacana found by sailing along the Cetiatl Archipelago from the Estuary. Our final stop on the tour lies in the capital city of Ahuicozl in the tropical Zatoc Empire. The Ahuicozl Water Garden is a beautiful and expansive structure commissioned by Emperor Tiozl long ago but continue to be expanded upon today. Partially submerged in water and with glass tunnels allowing wealthy visitors to walk partially beneath the waves the gardens are a thing of beauty featuring flora and fauna from all across the continent.,worldbuilding,ct7lsmk,1,t5_2rd6n

Dont mock this so easily since your carotid artery is pretty small and this one can pinch it closed for a minute to kill you in a way that will look like a stroke for any autopsy. Micro  Your work is measured in atoms worth of change. In some cases this is effectively like molecular manipulation since youre doing fusion  fission on the fly. Just put in a secondarypower for containing the atomic explosions you make so the person lives through doing this. Molecular Manipulation Can they make ANYTHING or only the things they know how to make? I mean lead to gold with this is simple  unless they need to monitor the shifting of every atom in the object.

I thought maybe the beginnings of the continents could be formed during this time before the water begins to rain out. I dont think there is a way to quantify geological activity but this is a world that spins quite rapidly has a larger core and more radioactive heating. This planet would have lots more geological energy than Earth would. I was hoping that those low density causing affects would be so accelerated that a bit of land would survive justuntil the timethat glaciers could be formed to lock up the ice and cause a runaway sea level decline effect. I have  billion years though with a KV star. Would it be possible to make plates out of something ecen less dense than earths continental crust so that even though the crust would be lighter than earths thered be maybe something like hydrated silicateSiO plates that are even lighter. I also made my model with a simplification I made the core a single density layer the mantle a single density layerthe oceans a single density layer etc...Basically I said that all of the water was in the oceans. If some amount of water were in the mantle then maybe the seas would be shallower and that would give the continents an extra edge.,worldbuilding,ctc38dr,1,t5_2rd6n

They vary in size and color some can be as small as  wheelers few are as big as  story buildings. What fact is consistent though is that they are incredibly deadly. Domestication is impossible. They spare no one. An imminent attack is signified by one flying in a circle high up in the sky. They can do this for minutes hours even days. They are classified into  subtypes. Scaled Bare and Haired.Scale Dragons are the traditional type of dragon. They are dangerous. They will destroy settlements just because. Their armored hide makes great armor it deflects all but the strongest puncture based weapons.Bare Dragons are dragons with no scales. They are rare but stronger than scale dragons except that take less damage. They are more elementally inclined. They are the most intelligent breed of dragon though they are JUST as deadly. Haired Dragons are primarily of the smaller variety though theres been large ones which is the result of genetic mutation. They do not kill humans unless they encroach on their territory if they do however they persistently attempt to kill the invader until they are dead or until the dragon is dead.

4691607,0,t1_ctlvae5,This is pretty much exactly what I was going to do.  The fire breath would have initially evolved as an antipredator thing when the ancestors of dragons were still fairly small but they kept it as they got bigger.  Part of my justification for why apex predators would still need to breathe fire is that they use it to hunt grazing herd animals scaring them and driving them off cliffs like how some Native Americans used to hunt buffalo or into other locations where they can be slaughtered in large numbers.  Theyd use it to manipulate prey in other ways too such as separating protective mothers from their young and to defend their kills from other animals that might want to steal some. If they ever have trouble flying in an emergency because theyre wounded or because they ate too much they could light a fire to create a thermal updraft and help them get in the air. Im also thinking they might use fire for communication purposes maybe for making smokesignals that can be seen over long distances.  They would try to avoid actually burning their prey only using fire to direct it but they might cook their food after since supposedly you can get more nutrients that way. Im not sure how much of a difference it actually makes though.  Another possible use if theyre omnivorous would be to increase their food supply by promoting the growth of groundlevel plants the way that some Aboriginal Australians did.,worldbuilding,ctlx3ph,5,t5_2rd6n

You get about as much water as you get and if theres more water than land or the world is very hot and the water expands like in Waterworld you get mostly ocean. In the movie there is a small bit of land at the peak of former Mount Everest theyre trying to get to. That ones interesting because there used to be more land and when the ocean rose up those land creatures humans had to adapt developing floating cities marauder aircraft carriers and archaic submersible vessels. Eventually humans with gills mutations started showing up who were hunted fiercely by those who didnt. A truly fascinating world which is what makes it such a shame that movie was resoundingly mediocre.Water levels change all the time so youll need to take that into consideration for your world primarily if there are ages where theres no land at all vs. ages that had more exposed land a la Waterworld. In the first scenario youll have a world almost entirely full of water creatures and presumably some intelligence would have evolved in your world like more social intelligent cephalopods and water dwelling mammals.

The moon has a diameter of about  KM and its gravity affects the earth in an almost negligible manner at least in the grander scheme of things so  KM should be very much fine. However you will need artificial gravity unless you wanna build a ringworld in which case it would have to spin very very slowly so as not to crush your people. Why would they need to be geothermal? Just use the heat as is to generate electricity with it. You will of course always have to add more energy to the system even if you do have it set up very efficiently. Fuel is not the same as power. While fuel is a great source of storing and releasing energy it is not the best thing if you have large amounts of space and can use fusion reactors. So what youre trying to say is Energy consumption would be insane which need not be the case. I dont know what your planet will look like or how much the people and machines on it will be using but unless you want to have it powered by thrusters I dont see why it would need a lot of energy unless it IS the Death Star which is not a planet per s and made for military stuff. As far as we know fusion creates the most easily accessible energy so that combined with solar sails which is essentially also harnessing fusion energy should do the trick unless you wanna invent a fancy exotic matter generator or a magical untiring highspeed hamster breed. Building a fucking planet even if it is barely moonsized is a logistically enormous undertaking even for large empires unless were talking galaxyspanning large. You also need to ask yourself what its gonna be made out of.

But while the fishing is valuable the drow are most valued for their long memories. If you were a good storyteller you would not have lost anything societally. If you were a dwarf You would be pitied if you were unable to complete your masterwork before your injury. However serious accidents are not uncommon as they work among the lava tubes and cliffs. If you have a knack for maps or figures you would be employed as an instructor.If you were a human You would be cared for to the best of your tribes ability. It is a shameful thing to abandon someone who needs care. You would probably do best to give away all your cattle to the tribe or members of your family in return for their care.Among the gnolls If you were very lucky this happened while you were hunting or raiding with a good packmate. She would snap you neck as soon as she learned the extent of your injuries to save you the shame of growing weak and taking that weakness into the afterlife. Otherwise the pack would splint your limbs and help you heal as best as you could  going to any lengths to keep you from dying. Once you had healed as much as you could they would help you hunt a truly dangerous creature like a lion or an elephant. You would be thrust to the forefront where you would surely be mauled to death.

As there are three types of soldier in the Extrasolar Forces they must be easily distinguishable. Spatial pilots wear a blue and grey formfitting suit that is marked on the chest with the serial number for their zipper and squads designation.  A thin band goes around the backs of their heads that can be expanded into a helmet capable of allowing survival in space. Sorta like StarLords thing from Guardians of the Galaxy.Aerial pilots have a black aviator jacket over a blue shirt. Their black pants have a thin white stripes down the sides  the number of stripes indicate their rank. On their right shoulder is a patch with the serial number of that soldiers glider and squad designation. Terrestrial soldiers dont have a required uniform but most wear green and brown to blend in with the terrain on planets surfaces and have a dark brown helmet with a tinted visor. Even if a Terrestrial soldier chooses to forgo the common attire they can usually be picked out of a crowd by the multiple weapons on their person.General Ryker wears a similar suit to the Spatial pilots but the blue is replaced with a lighter shade of grey and a gold insignia over his heart.The five members of the Feather Corps have an outfit similar to the Aerial pilots but with a white jacket and pants instead of black.

4818302,0,t3_3gus27,My prediction would be that the nation would crumble very quickly. Some explanation followsPeople in groups such as countries usually need a reason to stay in that group. In caveman days you could not ever possibly collect enough resources or meet enough people to dothedo if you werent in some kind of group. So if you were in a group you have an us versus nature mentality or a cause sotospeak. But as technology advanced agriculture became popular and groups became larger and more stable nature wasnt such a problem anymore. Instead other groups or other nations which competed for resources and land became the problem. So now all of a sudden the cause changed from being us versus nature to us versus everyone else. This is nationalism.In your world the isolated nation has no other nations to counter against. In the us versus them mentality there is no them therefore there is no cause to keep the group together. Instead of focusing on the problems that other nations cause the people begin to focus on what kinds of problems their own nation causes against them. Any ethnic group in your nation will be quick to blame other ethnic groups or the government itself for all of their problems. They begin to no longer identify themselves as Romans but instead as Goths or Israelites. The nation is a ticking time bomb waiting to implode due to massive civil wars. This is exactly how Rome fell and its how your nation will fall too.,worldbuilding,cu1vx8i,2,t5_2rd6n

It also severed humanoid access to the supernatural with the exception of druids. The Severing gave Satherians a vital role in transporting goods and people between the nowisolated city states. While many druids did so in an official capacity others found greater profit by offering discreet transport no questions asked.Fellow druids even strangers treat one another like family and outsiders often speak of them as an entity or organization. Most of the citystates believe that the druids have a kingdom among the prohibitively dangerous jungles in the center of the continent.

The body is mulched and interred in a local forestcopseequivalent. The community as part of the funeral ceremony contributes memories of the dead to a special vessel. Years later the vesselmulch grow into an areaappropriate tree and the leaves are implanted with these memories which anyone can pluck and experience.. Actual communing with the notquite dead. This is even more rare to the point of being little known as the circumstances are unlikely. Someone is killed violently but their damaged brain is still somewhat functional so it is placed on a special pedastal that constructs a virtual environment for the fragment of personality inside to inhabit and perhaps reconstruct itself.

While a lot of stories take place in roughly medieval timesusually with schizo tech most arent eternally stuck in medieval times.I dont see how being inspired by old civilizations is a bad thing. While creating obvious copys isnt necessarily good you cant tell me that you wouldnt want to see what a totallynotroman empire vs totallynotaztec empire war that takes place in a magic desert or something to that effect wouldnt be amazing.Most people are sick of generic races but then again most people who use those races at least put some twist on them or try to spin them their own way. For me I personally dont like seeing races that are different just for the sake of being different. I would rather have a world with generic elves and dwarves then a world with intelligent legged giant insectoids who communicate telepathically but are otherwise exactly like humans or elves or whatever.I dont exactly know what you mean by maps with no lore but what you said about locations with generic names does happen in real life a lot.On the other hand you made me glad because I realized that I managed to create a European semimedieval setting that is not completely generic. Basically the main setting of my world is an industrial revolutionera slavic confederation that is gearing up for war with a utopian...kiinddaa ancient greekI guess mageocracy. In the middle of this is a small neutral arthurian country built upon  what used to be a steampunk aztec civilization.

5134210,0,t3_3lamjj,Heres a point worth knowing years ago the word computer had an extremely different meaning. Computer in  was the term given to describe a human being specifically someone who rapidly calculated or computed mathematical puzzles in an attempt to solve a specific problem. The term was most widely used during the Second World War when hundreds of computers were employed at Bletchley Park to attempt to crack the Enigma Code using the bomba kryptologiczna a series of Polish equations and mathematical processes designed to crack the Enigma machines codes.It wasnt until Alan Turing developed the Bombe that the term began to apply to mechanisms. The Bombe was described as an electromechanical computer because it was an electromechanical mechanism that performed the same function as a real computer which is to say a human. Not  years ago computers were considered to be things that not only would one not NEED in the home but that one would actively dislike having in home. People who ran companies dedicating to selling computers nevertheless did not believe that computers would ever have a place in the home.A very brief timeline of computing prediction fuckups  years agogt I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.  Thomas Watson chairman of IBM  years agogt Where a calculator on the ENIAC is equipped with  vacuum tubes and weighs  tons computers in the future may have only  vacuum tubes and weigh only . tons.  Popular Mechanics  years agogt There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home.  Ken Olson founder of Digital Equipment Corp.We cannot predict  years hence. We struggle to predict  years hence  in  would you honestly have believed someone if theyd told you that within  years they could have a dualcore computer in their pockets that was also a phone and had a decent battery life AND could search the Internet cheaply? In  would you have believed someone who claimed that within  years all attitudes to air travel would be totally utterly and irreversibly changed forever? That how we viewed friends and neighbours would shift overnight into resentment mistrust and outright discrimination? Would you have believed someone who told you that we would go to war in Iraq within  years?We cant predict Earths future which is why we worldbuild. We cant predict the future its just not possible.

5138508,0,t3_3ld5pv,This is only about half of it as its rather large. If theres interest Ill see about sharing the whole thing in some way. Pardon the formatting I still dont have a good handle on reddits formatting crap. The bold thing never seems to work for some reason.The Aelfyr alefear known by men as ElvesTo understand an elf is to understand nature herself in all of her beauty and wrath. That is to say good luck. Damithras the SageIntroduction and DescriptionAncient tales known only to a few record that many of Kaerns races are descended from a race of men from beyond the stars. Now I cant speak to the truth of this or not and most scholars pass these stories off as nonsense if they are even aware of them but  among the Elves or Aelfyr as is marginally more proper some elders I have had the honor to speak with claim it is the truth. It is perhaps for this reason that they often tolerate mens mangling of their words and shortening of their names with amused patience.For truly their attitudes towards the use of the word elf or even well intentioned attempts to speak their tongue are met with an appreciative bemusement as that of a parent watching a child make its first fumbling attempts to speak. They understand the limitations of other races attempts to use their language and most gracefully accept the butchering of their of language by less able mouths .It is notable that the three races of Aelfyr known by men as High Elves Wood Elves and Dark Elves each speak basically the same tongue and refer to themselves by as far as I can determine the same name though subtle differences in pronunciation may escape my ear of which Aelfyr is a gross simplification. The full term is much more complex and rarely spoken to other races. A very rough very simplified meaning would be along the lines of The People who Remember. As you might infer from this memory is a very important if not the single most important thing to any elf.This significance can be seen throughout all three Elven cultures and even in their basic physical needs. For Elves do not sleep. Instead entering a dreamlike trance for at least several hours every day. As far as I can determine the time of day or time since the last trance do not appear to be of great importance only that they rest in such a way at least once every thirty hours or so. They appear to gain similar benefits from this trance as we do from sleep but they do not dream at least as we do in this state. Instead they remember. The trance is spent reliving prior experiences in a manner similar to lucid dreaming. This remembering dream allows them to explore paths untaken or learn new lessons from what has gone before. They in some ways quite literally live in the past.The importance of memory continues even beyond death. Each of the races have death rituals similar in intent if not execution. When an elf dies if at all possible their body is in some way reclaimed by the community in such a way that their memories are preserved and made available for others to experience and learn from. I have only had the opportunity to study the rites of the Wood Elves so far the other races being quite secretive about the process. Among the forest dwellers the deceased is placed within a sacred grove or beneath a sacred tree that is present in nearly every settlement. As the body is slowly broken down and consumed by the strangely quasidivine flora the tree or trees drink in the dead elfs memories. Once this process is complete any living elf may commune with the sacred trees to experience the lives of those who have gone before them. From what I have learned it would seem that being forgotten is the worst possible fate for an elf to the point that it reserved as the harshest of punishment used by the Aelfyr among their own kind.BiologyIn order to understand the complexities of their language and by turns their culture it is important to also be aware of the quirks of their biology. As mentioned previously there are three distinct subraces of Aelfyr known to man the High Elves the Wood Elves and the Dark Elves. Surprisingly there seems to be little true difference between them physically aside from coloration and average phenotypes. All Elves typically stand somewhere between five and seven feet tall with facial features that tend to be pointed and angular with prominent cheekbones and clearly defined jawlines. They have very prominent ears which tend to be long and pointed sloping back away from their faces. They usually have long almost feathery eyebrows and thick lashes but most grow no other hair on their bodies with the exception of wood elves who sometimes have facial hair. All three races have vertically slitted pupils and the proportions of their limbs tend to be slightly longer compared to their bodies than in men.While the outward appearance all three races is certainly exotic in differing ways the attribute that they share which makes many humans uncomfortable if they are aware of it is their highly unusual sex and gender makeup. Unlike us the Aelfyr possess more than two biological sexes though the exact number if it can be counted at all is difficult to pin down due to the way they shift over time. At birth every elf is a fully functional hermaphrodite possessing male and female primary sexual characteristics. Most also express some degree of secondary female characteristics as they mature but tend to remain relatively androgynous. They technically become capable of reproducing at around the age of  roughly the equivalent of a  year old human but their fertility rate is incredibly low at this stage. As they age various personality factors and some environmental influences usually lead them to favor one gender or the other until sometime between the ages of  to  or so they undergo a sort of metamorphosis into their fully adult form. This form is most commonly fully female with full males only forming about one fifth of the population. Other combinations of primary and secondary characteristics exist with the rarest being those that remain full hermaphrodites usually with a noticeable increase in their secondary female characteristics. Following this transformation individual fertility is greatly increased for about a fifty years and it is during this period that most elven children are conceived. The rare adult hermaphrodite tends to become aggressively sexual during this period and are more likely to occur in areas that have had dangerous population reductions. Regardless of their current form they almost universally fit some concept of human beauty as seen through a fae lens.Finally there is the remarkable fact of their incredible life spans. An elf can reasonably expect to live for eight or nine centuries short of some outside factor cutting their life short. The oldest are said to have lived over a thousand years. One would think that this combined with their other advantages and natural proclivity towards magic would make it easy for them to rule the world if they were so inclined but their many advantages are largely offset by normally low fertility. On average only one child is born per fifty elves every ten years although this number can increase greatly depending on the ages and sexes of the adults present in a community. A locale with several full males or hermaphrodites and suitable females all around optimal breeding age can achieve nearly human levels of fertility and population growth for several decades before some unknown mechanism slows their growth. It is my belief that this mechanism is tied with the mysterious connect the Aelfyr seem to share with their surrounding environment. All Aelfyr are magically capable in some way and many possess an uncanny bond with the locales in which they live for long periods. Their populations it is my belief somehow self regulate to a level optimal for the environment in which they dwell. It should also be noted that it is technically possible for an elf to have children many of the other races but this is rather rare and generally possible when the elven parent is at the height of his or her fertility or virility and even then the chance is roughly a tenth of that of an elfelf pairing. Children of such couplings are normally half elves who generally dont have much in the way of developmental difficulties but they are usually sterile and tend to have trouble fitting in with either society not really belonging anywhere. Rarely it is possible for twins to be born one an elf and the other of the second parents race. The exception to this is of course Orcs with their highly unnatural virility and breeding patterns. ,worldbuilding,cv5ds3n,2,t5_2rd6n

He is also believed to have died during the fall of his empire.In reality he is the most powerful mage currently in existence with him being the first mortal to ever wield a small amount of the same powers that gods wield. The religious order that he was supposedly a devout member of is the same order that now views him as a sort of a prophet. Though the problem with this is that primary tenant of this religion is complete rejection of magic and anything magical. This obviously would never sit well with an absurdly powerful mage and he was never religious in any manner. Lastly he was believed to have died when a certain magical event destroyed the capital city of the elven civilization. In reality he had accidentally caused the event himself. Instead of perishing as one of the tens of thousands whom died the gods who were extremely pissed at him Mostly because his rampant abuse of magic magic that he should have no access to was starting to jeopardize the gods plans for this planet trapped him within his own pocket dimension. Presumably cut off from any and all magic energies. He is still stuck in there as an immortal very much alive and very much pissed at the gods.,worldbuilding,cv7vrnd,1,t5_2rd6n
5161864,0,t1_cv75srb,Okay. I like the story and its close to falling in line with real life. Compare these popular military contractors for the US government BAE Systems Northrop Grumman Raytheon and Lockheed Martin Note that one of these things is not like the other. Lockheed Martin is the only company that has an actual icon. All the other companies just have their name as their logo but Lockheed has their iconic vectors which suggest a star planes crossing paths or a concept sketch. The logo is minimalist and effectively conveys what the company is pursing. Lockheed has this logo because they still have an international commercial market in addition to their military contracts. When you make the logo for your big military contractor keep that in mind. Now Im going to analyze and critique your logo. When I first saw this I thought it was a Mining Company. The arrow is pointing down the random cuts out of the shape remind me of mineshafts and its a big bulky utilitarian form. Theres nothing graceful about this logo. From the screw in the upper left to the thick overwhelming blackred color palette this logo inspires thick pieces of metal smashing against heavy things. You need to find out what your companys first product was. You say they researched new energy sources and propulsion so was their very first product a type of battery? You mentioned engines so was their first product a new propulsion system? An engine doesnt bring you down. An engine takes you forward and up. If you want to use the arrow as your imagery make sure its moving to your advantage. The important thing to remember is that design should be invisible. Dont add flare to your logo because you think it looks cool. The Rule of Cool only applies to concept art. When youre making a polished logo you want every square millimeter of it to convey the story of the company. Also your color scheme is bad. Learn a little bit of color theory itll change your life. Everything from school projects to house renovations suddenly get a lot more fun. In an ideal world your color scheme should make strokes outlines around shapes completely unnecessary unless its representing a part of your story. Before you put too much work into a logo make a concept sheet. Do ten logos which all look completely different. Then choose two. Make five iterations of each. Now you have ten variations of logos. Choose three and refine them. Whichever you find yourself paying more attention to THATs your logo. Good luck and keep posting these updates! Logos are a vastly underappreciated part of worldbuilding and can help define the companies operating within the world. ,worldbuilding,cv87307,2,t5_2rd6n

In advanced cases respiratory insufficiency may occur.When small silica dust particles are inhaled they can embed themselves deeply into the tiny alveolar sacs and ducts in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide gases are exchanged.

In excessive rain youd have plenty of water and there is still food for longer as there will still be some vegetation and mushrooms and stuff that can grow in the excessive humidity.So if your insane deity wants a fast death drought would probably be quicker.

Especially with the rate of comic page production being so much lower.  So not only does the story seem to take more pages at  pages a week it can take a LONG time to get anywhere.That said my end goal optimal reading format is having someone sit down with a physical copy and breeze through it.  Even at  pages it only takes a half hour or so to read through the whole thing! The current overraching story dealing with the threat of the deathbots will run the majority of the story.  Weve finished two arcs of that Battle at Arkjut Sleepy Coma time with oh Id estimate  more similar arcs?  I have to estimate because Im purposefully keeping things a bit vague to keep the story fresh in my mind as I write it and to include Seba in the story development process.

From the perspective of the humans aboard the colony ship that reached the vrrild homeworld it was their First Contact moment and they were shocked to not only find another sapient species there but also one that revered humanity has selfsacrificing messiahs. Long before another human colony ship had arrived during the middle of the vrrild equivalent of the Cold War just as it was about to go hot. The human colonists provided a common enemy for both sides of the Cold War to rally against and the war against them brought about a new era of global cooperation and citizenship for the vrrild. While humanity was initial viewed as an enemy in the intervening centuries the vrrild came to believe that the earlier humans had deliberately chosen to become the villains that the vrrild needed to find common aground and avoid a selfdestructive atomic war.Tirna The Curtain Coast is an ongoing wtf moment. The Curtain Coast surrounds the island that was once the home of the Kingdom of Havara the earliest human state. Havara fell during the civil war that followed the assassination of King Ramaira. It also didnt fall but ultimately one of Ramairas four oldest sons each won the ensuing war. Also the kingdom was supplanted by a republic. Also all the humans on the island were devoured by the gwengweng a race of sapient wyverns that exist only within the context of the Curtain Coast. And so on. The island is now a rippling vortex of mutually exclusive possible states. Any ship that strays too close finds itself shifting from one version of reality to another. Its rare for people to leave the island but occasionally it does happen  such as when a group of gwengweng broke through the confines of the Curtain Coast and attempted to invade the mainland. However flotsam from the other worlds beyond the Curtain does frequently wash out to sea and such exotic treasures tempt sailors to venture close.The Celestial Sea The return of Esaldaios caught everyone by surprise. It is the youngest of the gods and rules a burning world of blue fire. While not the most powerful of its kin it is the most overtly hostile to mortal and Celestial life. Its female aspect is a goddess of discord while its male aspect is a god of destruction. The Demiurge had banished Esaldaios to the outer Abyss where it could do no harm long before they created humanity and elevated the Celestials. After wandering the Abyss for countless millennia Esaldaois grew jealous its siblings and sought to crash its world into the Earth breaking the Asherah and destroying the reality the Demiurge had built. Day by day the burning blue world grew brighter in the sky. As Esaldaios neared its growing influences allowed for the elevation of humans to the ranks of a new Celestial Race  the Salamandrines. These worked on Earth to sow the seeds of discord and pave the way for the worlds destruction. The greatest of the Salamandrines became the first of a new Exalted Race the Drakones. Luckily for the world Esaldaios plan was thwarted the Salamandrines and the Drakones were driven off Earth to dwell on Esaldaioss world which fled back into the Abyss. As a consequence of this averted calamity the Anointed Empire was established on Earth.The Snare The day the Tripartite fell and the Years of Ash began is still a great unexplained mystery that shocked the world. On that day all the sorcerors in the world disappeared. Some tales say they fell dead wherever they were in the world all at once. Some say they all ascended to become part of the Mystery. Some say they were pulled screaming into the World Below. A barrier of living redcedar grew around their ancient capital whose name as been purged from history it is known today only as the Hollow City. No mortal who has entered the city since has ever left it and it is known to be under several curses. Though light shines within it nothing is ever illuminated. Its air carries no sound. Its roads all bend back upon themselves. Only spirits can successful navigate these hazards. On the same day a great pillar of smoke rose on the northwestern horizon and soon the skies were thick with soot and the land blanketed in ash. After years of wandering through this bleak wasteland the ragged bands of survivors managed to find new homes where they could settle down and begin rebuilding society.Eidolons The Twelve Lords Conference was a meeting by a dozen of the most prominent lords of Lakha Empire all of whom were Archons people empowered by magical philosophies to discuss the unprecedented lack of new Archons emerging from the general population. As the lords waited for the arrival of the Lakha emperor an explosion tore through the council chamber killing the lords and their staff. Some suspected anarchistic adherents of the Hive others than some rival nation sought to cripple Lakha in preparation for war.

Falstaff boats get the big net.

The most common interruption starts with But maybe! because the idea is that the previous singer got a detail of the story wrong and theyre being politely corrected as if this is something rehearsed and falling apart rather than something improvised.

5517197,0,t1_cwguil5,Well a lot of it is just personal preference. For example the way the gods are real and how Nirn is in the centre of the solar system with the stars being holes punched in Aetherius. Its cool as a mythological story but Ive always been much more partial to a more realistic take on fantasy where the mythology is either just stories or ambiguously real.The way the series deals with some issues is a bit handwavey. The one that immediately comes to mind is halfbreeds. The lore states that a child born of two races will be whatever the mother is no exceptions. That always felt a bit lazy to me though granted its probably necessary given that game mechanics wouldnt allow for halfbreeds to be rendered.Some of the lore surrounding the origins of the races and especially the beast races seems a bit overthetop to me as well. The Argonians being symbiotic with the Hist trees is really cool but the thing about licking Hist sap at birth being what gives them intelligence and bipedalism otherwise they just stay as regular lizards seems a bit silly to me. Similarly the whole Khajiit used to be elves but then they became cats and the phases of the moons dictate which one of a dozen or so subspecies they are and they also went to the moon by stacking themselves on top of each other and all this apparently being true is just way too out there for my tastes. The loreculture for the beast races in general seems like it has no real theme or coherence to it the same way the Nords or Dunmer have for example. They just seem to use them as sort of generically exotic races. ESO actually did a lot to give them a muchneeded cultural aesthetic though which is good.I feel like part of the reason the lore has become so full of bizarre and inconsistent stories is because Bethesda seems to really hate retconning and when their games change they try too hard to reconcile the aesthetics and lore of past games and end up shoehorning things together.So most of the time I just make my own take on the lore. Like having the bizarre origin stories for the races be just mythology that may or may not be true. The Khajiit are just cat people evolved from cats and not elvesturnedintocats and the Argonians are just evolved from lizards and not sapfuelled mutants.Again this is all just my own personal preference being that I like my fantasy to have that extra dose of realism to balance out the stranger aspects of it.The lack of conlangs is also a bit of a shame though forgiveable since theyre meant to be games first and foremost. They did a decent try with Dovahzul but its basically just a slightly modified English with new words.,worldbuilding,cwgve6f,6,t5_2rd6n

It is perfectly possible to disrupt this and if you could predict exactly where and when that particle burst was going to emerge from FTL it would be possible to produce an electromagnetic burst that would prevent the signal from reaching anyone in comprehensible form.The problem is that doing this is really really hard for various reasons I can explain if you want but its long.

Ive looked into a lot of this myself and have found much of the same and it sounds like a pretty brutal place to live so Im trying to think of ways in which advanced tech or possibly even magic could be applied to make things a little easier ie. dealing with the high windsstorms et cetera. Assuming there are such frequent and relentless storms do you think that would actually make the twilit regions harder to settle despite being more temperate?The idea of underground cities on the sun side is a possibility but it doesnt quite jive with the imagery I have of this kingdom and the contrast between light and dark. I was thinking of using mountainsboth the shade they would provide in some cases and possibly situating cities atop them since the air would be cooler at a higher altitude. They would also help to block some of the more brutal winds.A higher level of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere would help to distribute the heat more evenly across the whole planet correct? I was planning on having the two sides trade resources but considering the rough seas and the rough storms it sounds like travel between the two would be difficult. Maybe submersible vessels or some sort of underground train system?And regarding plants and animals they may not be able to develop there organically but if this planet is settled by humans then could life be introduced to such an environment? Perhaps greenhouses with controlled environments to grow food but Im unsure about how to incorporate more advanced animals.

5720264,0,t3_3tgct4,The Autumnsword. To steal it would gain you the enmity  and grudging admiration  of an entire species.Autumnsword is the current name of the ancestral blade of House Shadowstone the wolvenfolk dynasty that currently rules the nation of Wyr. Its been in the family for generations and currently sits in the scabbard of the Wyrs current Alpha Thol Shadowstone. Thol however is better known by his deed name Thol  Autumnsword  he was given his deed name for decapitating the previous Alpha in single combat.The blade is forged from a metal known to other species as wolfsteel a proprietary secret of wolvenfolk metalurgists. Its many times more flexible and resilient than standard steel while weighing significantly less allowing a billet to be folded upon itself many times more than normal steel while still making a reasonablyweighted blade. But this isnt even just a masterwork wolfsteel blade  theres more to it.Its of a rarer form of craftsmanship known as sung metal. Wolvenfolk shamans of the Path of Metal have the ability to sing metal into shapes and items. Singing is in quotes because the process is mostly a magical and mental exercise  it is merely often accompanied by actual singing because the Metal Path Shamans are by long tradition taught to sing while shaping metal as a mnemonic aid. The quality of sung metal depends both on the material used and the amount of time and effort put into the exercise a chunk of scrap copper can be sung into a somewhat functional knife within seconds but true masterworks take much more time.The Autumnsword was sung from a billet of the finest wolfsteel money could buy over the course of a week by three Shamans working in unison. The crystalline structure of its metal is flawless right down to the molecular level and it can hold an edge for years of constant battle without dulling. Its flats are completely unadorned as not even diamond could scratch them. There is probably no sword equal to it anywhere in the world. It is too large for a human to wield effectively but merely possessing it would mark one as a peerless warrior  or a legendary thief.The difficulty of stealing it would lie in who owns it  Thol Shadowstone  Autumnsword. Hes been Alpha for nigh on  years and you dont stay the Alpha of Wyr without being observant quick on your feet and exceptionally good at fighting. Forget about trying to steal it off him while hes awake the only way youd get it off him is by fighting him for it. If youre thinking of doing that consider that Thol is able to capably fend off challengers to his throne and lead armies from the front at the age of   an age not all wolvenfolk reach with most who do being long past their fighting days. You probably arent as capable a fighter as him or you wouldnt have the time or inclination to be a master thief.That leaves stealing it while hes asleep. No matter where he happens to be youll have to sneak past a bunch of wellarmed creatures whose senses of smell and hearing are both vastly more acute than those of a human  and youll have to do it during the day because thats when wolvenfolk sleep. Youll also have to contend with his honour guard who guard every entrance and exit to his quarters in groups of three.

5757355,0,t3_3tyrx7,I think the Extra History episodes on Shaka Zulu and the Zulu Empire explain what happened in that situation pretty well.Would us encountering an alien tribal society go similarly? Have we learned anything from history?Im not convinced that its possible for a species to learn to speak the language of another species. Im not convinced that human brains are capable of that nor that they could create machines capable of doing it.There are plenty of species on earth right now that have languages that we cant decipher dolphins whales elephants birds various primates etc after years of study.And those species evolved in similar situations to the ones we evolved in right alongside us. The fact that animals so similar to us have minds so completely alien implies that species that develop on other planets will be completely impossible for us to comprehend.You might think that with enough time our capacities will expand infinitely but the thing is that we wont. The human brain isnt an infinite object capable of doing anything it is finite and at some point we will hit the upper limits of what we can do. Im not convinced that understanding the languages of other species isnt beyond that limit.This isnt saying that we wont think weve managed to understand the language people used to think we had described the entire languages of various animals they used to think that other animals had finite unchanging languages which could be composed of only a few pieces. Gradually weve learned that animal languages are more complicated than we used to think.

5767501,0,t1_cxbvb69,gt What would happen in that phase? After being exposed but before becoming sentient again Draugs are essentially mindless. They are mostly docile and just wonder around though when threatened or in larger numbers they can get violent. These mindless Draugs will also listen to sentient ones without question.gt How would that affect their will to continue on living after regaining conscience how high would you estimate the suicide rate amongst Draugs in general? Most Draugs that become sentient just wake up. They dont retain memories of their past both as a Draug and before. Suicide would be somewhat common initially but once people get settled suicide will probably slow down.gt Is there any further mental decline that could occur and set them back to the ghoul state? Severe isolation can led to a return to a mindless state but as long as a Draug interacts with other individuals on a semiregular bases they will not suffer any mental decline the same applies to communities to an extent if a small town never experience outside contact or change it can led to a slow spiral towards mindlessness.gt How do Draugs that want to turn more people into Draugs handle those ghouls before they retain sentience? They actually make perfect servants. They will do whatever you want without question and are perfect for harvesting the Hallow that is used for making more Draugs. They will usually use them as slaves until they attain sentience than they are normal citizens. To help the process along they try to get Draugs to do normal things like socialize play games read ext.gt How do other peaceloving Draugs prevent those extremist Draugs from turning more humans if at all?The peaceloving Draugs tend not to be on great terms with the living as the living dont see a difference between the fanatics and the moderates. Nonextremest also benefit from the creation of more Draugs as they help rebuild villages. Most Draugs tend to be against the extremists but will take in newly created Draugs and rarely enter in direct conflict with extremists.gt Would there be an internal conflict how do their politics look in general?There arent any real Draug states. The extremists organize in tribes that mine Hallow and raid neighboring lands to make new Draugs. Outside of those most Draugs live in small communities that mostly keep to themselves. Later on when outsiders began to invade the lands of the Draugs larger coalition would form for mutual defense. These coalitions were made of all walks of life but tended to be dominated by the extremists prolonged conflict with no ability to replenish will mean they will lose even moderates understood the necessity of unsavory actions.gt Do they make attempts at diplomacy with living humans?Yep and it will almost never end well. Pretty much everyone will see them as monsters that need to be exterminated. The only exception are the followers of a developing religion at a time its still a work in progress so no name yet. They view all who acceptunderstand god as worthy and have a huge missionary culture. This religion is the dominate faith among the Draugs and this shared belief gives the Draugs higher standing with the few followers of said religion.gt  Those who want to be left in peace and thats it.This is what I see as the approach most Draugs take partly because thats the approach most people take.gt  Those who attempt to intermingle and coexist with humans.I hadnt though about a Roma like Draugs who live outside the normal social order but are tolerated. Ill probably use that.gt  Those who want to turn humans and raise the number of Draugs aggressively. yep.gt  Those who deny.I dont see these types of Draugs making it very far but there would certainly exist.,worldbuilding,cxc0fl6,1,t5_2rd6n

The males are just not as strong. Though I do have a sister who was born a male but she has brought more than ten tens of cows from raids on our neighbors tribe. She is exceptionally brave.Do not mistake I am not one of those that thinks males are only good for fucking. Good males are critical to the pack. When we hunt and raid the camp and pup warren must be protected. Strong and fierce males are needed. Strong and fierce and clever males are needed for strong and fierce and clever pups.But for a male to rule a pack . . . This is a spiders logic. It is absurd. Look at Anansi the Spider. Always he seeks to rule. Always he fails and looks foolish.The fisherdrow take good care of their men. It is bad to marry more husbands than you can support. But if you have more husbands then you have more hands to help you fish. You also need to keep them happy. Fisherdrow males are eager and frisky. I always have a good time when I visit the fisherdrow. They are delicate and furless but fun in a pile.From birth to death there are three fisherdrow males for every female. It can take tens of years for her to get with child so it is best to have many a few husbands around for when she gets into heat. When you visit a fisherdrow household the woman will let you pick which of her husbands beds you can sleep in. If her husband finds you pleasing he will stay in the bed to share it with you. A fisherdrow who has many children will be a very popular hostess.Humans are always found in a clump. Any number of them may decide that they are family. And if you think humans are vulnerable you should see the young. Nafu has held many of the human pups yes. They are noisy nuggets of toothless fat. It is good that they have fierce mothers to care for them while their brothers and fathers herd cows. The men may help us raid on neighbors for cows but the women are the teeth that guards the heart. The dwarves are most curious. The humans say that it is difficult to look at dwarves and tell the bucks from the bitches. It is clear enough to Nafu but humans have no noses. With dwarves they do not understand that it is females who bear children so it is females who should say what happens. They say that males may rule just as well. It is pointless to argue sense with them. They are happy enough with the arrangement.Dwarves pick only one mate. They do not even visit the fisherdrow.

Some of my characters are explorersA lot of countries have tried to explore the Seeded Lands actually. The first country to send an army to the Seeded Lands was the Garlan Empire. Ten thousand soldiers of the White Army essentially cannon fodder were sent in and none returned. That scared the shit out of a lot people but many thought superior technology was the answer. Fast forward a couple hundred years where my world is now. Tanks nukes all kinds of advanced weaponry. The Angkal Imperial Alliance decides its time to advance into the Seeded Lands. Tanks armored cars APCs artillery and infantry venture into the unknown. Nobody hears a goddamn thing from them for like three months. Then suddenly one day the A.I.A receives radio messages from the army that went into the Seeded Lands. The only thing that can be heard is hysterical laughter that doesnt quite sound human and really gross wet sounds in the background. The messages came literally nonstop until the emperor ordered the channel cutoff. Since then nobody has made a full scale attempt. Its just not worth it. Perhaps the weirdest thing about the Seeded Lands is that even the godsgoddesses are in the dark. They simply have no power over the area. Myths? There are a lot of myths.

Creators make fictional realworld towns and cities all the time.I guess my best advice would be to try to find a way to mesh it into the realworld in such a way that the reader can suspend their disbelief a bit. For example if your story needs some fictional country in Europe dont be  specific of where EXACTLY it is in the world unless your writing some sort of alternatehistory story and give it enough historical cohesion to the rest of the realworld so it doesnt stand out too much i.e. A bunch of nations were created following the end of both the Cold War and the Second World War so maybe your tiny principality was a result of that.Also dont forget that there are plenty of random islands mountains and stretches of tundra and desert in the world.

5993342,0,t3_3xj2pu,Sort of.The Finepochal War was a major clash between  religions Consortianism and Convocationism. States from both religions have committed atrocities on the other. Most notable was the sack of Oretz a large strategically located Convocationistmajority city located along the river ldor by Hist forces led by Melron the OneEyed Eagle Ledorocco. The city was virtually exterminated by the besieging soldiers who were hungry angry and underpaid. It was on a similar scale and level of brutality as what happened in Nanking The massacre became called the Day of Black Tears.Massacres like in Oretz became frequent as the war intensified and hatred grew but Oretz became particularly notorious because it led to the Consortian Churchs condemnation of Melron and demanded he stand before a tribunal. Of course this wasnt actually out of pity for the Convocationist civilians but was a result of careful behind the scenes maneuvering by opponents of the House of Staether the rulers of Histland and Melrons bosses. The Staethers needed Melrons loyalty but between him and the Church they chose the latter as it was an important bastion of their international power. Melron upon receiving word of what he perceived to be a betrayal from the Staethers took the Hist army as his own and became a warlord.

5999854,0,t1_cy63mrw,Nice.Im developing mine for a story cooking in my head.  Basically a civilization on the other side of the universe I dont know what theyre called yet is doing experiments in animal behavior and they created human beings thousands of years ago to be their test subjects.  There are hundreds if not thousands of copies of planet Earth all around the galaxy and the one that Im focusing on has a giant wall right in the middle of what we know as the United States.  Two species of humanoid beings live on the planet which we later realize is just men and women.  Both sides have been programmed to fear the other and think that theyre all deformed monster aliens that want to kill us all and so on and so forth.... The civilization is way more advanced and whatnot than ours and you THINK that its set hundreds of years from where we are now but wink wink not so much.  ,worldbuilding,cy640vx,4,t5_2rd6n

6011400,0,t3_3xsoe8,Theres a few points that could effect what flying mounts would be useful for.    For starters when you say rare do you mean you wont find this breed of warhorse outside of a nobles stable rare? Or is it more as rare as a Unicorn kind of rare?    If its the latter then I cant imagine such a thing being used in any kind of combat unless the mount itself has some kind of immeasurable offensive capabilities like a classic dragon. Otherwise they would very likely be reserved exclusively for high altitude recon where they are far out of harms reach.   If its the former then I would move to my next question.What are the properties of this creature?    Are they agile fliers able to roll out of a dive a dozen feet from the ground or is their flying capabilities more rigid? If so then there might be a chance at some really innovative combat roles. A sufficiently agile flyer may be able to preform a charge dive similar to standard cavalry but with the benefit of being able to do so from any direction quickly or even right into the center of a formation. They could also have the advantage of being hyper effective screening units or even kept in reserve to harass sufficiently exposed artillery cavalry and other flying cavalry.       Are they powerful flyers is armoring these things a viable option? If so then there is opportunity for heavy flying cav. Smash into a formation with pikelength lances and immediately take off again for another smash. Doing this effectively would also depend on how exactly they take off whether they need a running start or not to take off.   Are these mounts particularly intelligent themselves? Can they be taught to employ complex maneuvers or even learn to fight autonomously? There could be opportunity here for battle mounts flyers that can fight in conjunction with their riders spear and clawtalon. Mounts could perhaps learn to toss the bombs themselves and use their own clawtaloneye coordination to aim more effectively.Theres also potential for use as a Dragoon style unit. Rapidly mobilize flyer mounted infantry to key tactical positions dismount and dominate the battlefield.    There is still room for harassment functions to disrupt formations or to slow movement or other activities. Fly low discharge firearm fly off to reload repeat. Though I dont see this being very effective beyond perhaps some psychological fear factor of constant unyielding arms fire.Those are all the thoughts I have to offer for now hope theres something useful for you in there.,worldbuilding,cy7mhbg,2,t5_2rd6n

6027710,0,t3_3xz8sr,Ill throw my hat in the ring and say  thousand years.  Recovering the tech base quickly is dependent on a couple things preserving knowledge and preserving the people who can apply it.  In both cases were screwed.In terms of preserving people pretty much everyone is going to die who doesnt already live on huntinggathering.  Even farmers and herders need their seed and animals.  If humans died out in  BCE then most progress of domestication has probably been undone.  Crops maybe not so much but animals definitely.Which brings us to the second problem if most if not all of the knowledgeable people die then there isnt much to preserve.  Anything that is preserved physically textbooks brought through etc will rot and decay fairly quickly.  And the long term preservation of text will likely devolve into a cultreligion.  This means that misinterpretations of the knowledge that does come through will be sacred and any challenges to it by real innovators resisted.I really dont see us making much of a rapid recovery unless significant supplies come through with us or far fewer and more choicely picked people come through.,worldbuilding,cy9r4wj,1,t5_2rd6n

When an elf has grown fond of another they may entrust them with it as an indicator that they perceive their relationship as being close to if not exceeding a blood bond. Showing your birth name to someone else is a private display of utmost respect and trust for that person. And since state officials are required by law in certain cases to inspect and identify individuals by their birth name it naturally translates that an elf must show utmost respect and trust toward their homeland.Renegades of the state tattoo new symbols over their birth name to render themselves wiped from official records and as an indication that they begin a new life free from the states oppression. Or to avoid stigmata add new glyphs to their symbols though not all symbols permit additional glyphs and not all additions will make sense i.e. some might bear the birth name Lywath but adding glyphs to it would result in the new symbol meaning turgid lip,worldbuilding,cycphwg,8,t5_2rd6n

The people live in the domes simply because it is convenient. They could go outside in a suit but it is considered very unpleasant at best if not lethal.An alternate was to do this is to introduce the parasitic fungus from The Last of Us so the domes are safe spots where people dont have to worry about being infected.A biological threat can easily affect just one species severally targeted at humans and also adapt in turn so it stays relevant and keeps the people in their domes.,worldbuilding,cye5w63,2,t5_2rd6n
6074167,0,t1_cyfsfim,First off thanks!gtI think its absolutely something you can do and would deal positively with a lot of dei ex machina that we get with magic.Thats one of my primary goals here After working on a different setting for a few years where magic was fairly powerful and common place I found that it got a bit tiring for me to try and write up puzzles or scenarios or problems to solve in clever ways only to have cast this very basic spell end up being the most efficient solution. Dont even get me started on healing spells either Those sorts of schools of magic are the ones Ive nerfed the most heavily. I never enjoyed having combat scenarios drag on because player characters keep healing themselves or everybody casting restorative magic on an NPC the moment they get wounded just to play things overly safe.The rule of thumb I try to use in the application of any new magical force to a setting is Why has nobody used this to take over the world yet? Maybe its just because Ive spent more time as a GM than a player but I find that a lot of common use magics could very easily be harnessed to great effect and a lot of RPGfantasy settings dont really justify how peacefulstable their worlds are in light of this.,worldbuilding,cyft5zd,1,t5_2rd6n

6079016,0,t1_cygf9yq,Melchizdek was founded by the Corizian Brethren a communal sect of Christianity practiced mostly by ethnic Italians in obscure Balkan towns. Rising nationalism instability in Europe at the turn of the century and centuries of Ottoman oppression caused thousands of Corizians to emigrate to the Americas where they formed large and successful agricultural colonies and quickly earned the envy and ire of their new neighbours. Today Melchizdek sits at the northwestern corner of the area of Corizian settlement and is an important religious cultural and economic center. After decades of further immigration only  of the urban population claims Corizian ancestry with only  of that population having any grasp of the traditional Corizian Italian dialect. The city is a popular tourist stop on the highway between Wabanusca and St. Sophia because of its unique Mediterraneanstyle main street. The renowned Melchizdek Temple meanwhile is home to thousands of rare manuscripts that were spirited out of Albania in the closing days of the second World War and is considered to be one of the most aweinspiring examples of Western religious architecture.The river has a local minimum at Fort McDougall and sweeps north. Back when the northern border was drawn there was a hot contest between the authorities of the Kanamonta and Mathilda Territories over who would get ownership of Fort Assyria one of the most prominent settlements in the area. Ultimately it was decided that the Fort would be awarded to Kanamonta but the fledgling territory would lose all of the forested land between Fort Assyria and the eastern reaches of the Kinissitchee River. The bargain was accepted. Once railroad travel replaced river travel as the primary mode of transportation in the West though Fort Assyria lost almost all of its strategic value. Today it is a remote settlement mostly inhabited by Native Americans from the reservations that surround the Fort.,worldbuilding,cygfxro,12,t5_2rd6n

6139675,0,t1_cynez41,In my world things like world hunger and what not arent really a concern for the most part. Magic is super abundant and having a couple of basic magic users will pretty much guarantee not dying of starvation or dehydration.     The only case where this wouldnt be the case is in a classist area where people without magic are the lowest class. Showing potential will allow you to get out and save your family if they can live in the slums long enough. Basically helping out those without magic is considered beneath people and doing so would get you ostracized from society and those you helped would also be put in more danger most likely being killed. So even those who need help would be hesitant to take it because someone might just be tricking them in order to have an excuse to kill them because killing someone helplessunless they did something illegal is seen as almost just as bad as helping them.     Real nasty place to be in. But if she were to be good and not completely evil she would be able to save them all and avoid any repurcussions. In fact shed even be able to save those she helped by possibly having those that were killed release a toxin into the air that only those she decided to give immunity to would be able to survive. Of course she might do that anyways.     ...and then have those with the immunity have a very shortened life span that leads to a painful death. Or lie about the immunity have someone she controlled kill one of them and then have them die from the toxins giving those who want to rise up more confidence to fight the oppressors!

6199384,0,t3_40crvr,From the backstory of my SciFi world That trope about In the future all humans will be one race?  That happens pretty much everywhere.  Except on Earth.  Where aside from a class of rulers that make the folks in The Hunger Games look like honest prudes everyone still hates anyone who doesnt look like them.  Because humans from Earth are terrible. My initial story is set on a planet that is basically a giant refugee camp for people from Earth that is overcapacity.  They have to stay in the camp for  years so that they will unlearn all the habits that living on Earth taught them before the colonial authorities will actually let them in.  Because humans from the colonies are terrible. One of my main characters a onetime bisexual who was bisexual back on Earth because it was an easy way to advance up the social ladder. Among my ancillary villains is a group of Christian fundamentalist space pirates who behave like ISIS.  Including the taking of captive nonChristian women as sex slaves. Plus making male captives into eunuchs.  Because Christian humans are terrible. There are no Muslims in my story because in the backstory Muslims believe that space travel was and is an offense against God and an insult to his omnipotence and killed millions of other Muslims who doubted this the survivors all left Earth.  Because Muslim humans are terrible. All the Jewish people got thrown off of Earth years before my novel takes place because pretty much all humans are terrible to them.  They have since settled on their own new world and have become isolationist and paranoid to the point of xenophobia.  Because they are understandably terrible. One of my POV characters is being mindcontrolled well emotion and memorycontrolled which is pretty much the same thing by the villain.  Who pretty much gets to rewrite her memory and emotional state at will and can even make her suicidal as a selfdestruct mechanism if she resists him. In my story Earth was basically ruined over a period of about  years by the future equivalent of social justice warriors. Specifically Earth was run by stupid rich people and filled with poor resentful almostpeasants who subsist on state welfare with all industry being done by robots.  Think of it as the basic income gone horribly right. Everyone of any racialreligiousethnic group who wasnt popular or a politicallyreliable client class of the rulers was either exiled left for colonies or watched their families descend into dependence and misery.  Because SJWs are terrible. In the old United States the South Rose Again tm.  And they were fucking curbstomped though it took  years the bankrupting of the U.S. government and European and Chinese mercenaries to do it.  Any survivors with technical chops left and became the pilots of ark ships that brought humans to new colonists.  But because most of the colonists thought of the old Dixie Folk as violent racists who would kill them at the first opportunity and the old Dixie Folk thought the colonists were also violent racists who would kill them at the first opportunity the old Dixie folk were never allowed to settle anywhere but on ships which makes them insular clannish prone to health problems from years of exposure to radiation and vacuum and also terrible. The colonies didnt come with atmospheres or arable land so the colonies had to build those themselves.  Oftentimes they didnt or the colonists were too busy fighting among themselves for power.  A few billion people roughly half of all the colonists who emigrated from Earth died. Because humans are terrible. Then when Earth went to shit Earths rulers blamed it all on said colonies not paying taxes back to Earth. stopped all emigration and declared war on the colonies.  As well as massacring the said old Dixie Folk for having the guts to smuggle out emigrants. When the colonies banded together and began fighting back and the war started going badly for Earth Earth fought with supersoldier shock troops. Grown from what would have been aborted fetuses. Again because humans are terrible. When Earth lost the colonials did their best to prevent Earth from ever becoming a problem again.  This included vaporizing every rich city most centers of government power and more than a few elite universities to make sure that humans would know that any attempt at building a social democracy will end with your entire family getting masered into atoms by the angry descendants of the people your social democracy fucked over.  Why? Because humans. are. terrible.They should really not let people as cynical as me become writers.,worldbuilding,cyuaxw0,2,t5_2rd6n

People like us are the Men of Fur as we have hair that others dont. Other examples include the Men of Feather which have wings and feathers the Men of Scales have scales and can breathe underwater the Men of Leaf which are plantlike. There are a few others but you get the point.Keep in mind when you imagine a person with fur you probably dont imagine a normal human. The other variants with feathers and whatnot probably sound very animalistic but are actually quite similar to us just without hair.Anyway to answer your question. As each resembles a specific culture interbreeding between races is viewed like it would have been in early th century some people are okay with it others arent. What helps is that they usually dont form hybrids so a racist cannot use the excuse of diminishing their pure race.There are many details I am skipping over here in order to stay on topic but I can explain each race further if you would like to hear more.,worldbuilding,cywzgfm,1,t5_2rd6n

6244139,0,t3_410zia,If youre not careful you might find yourself in The Scraps a gigantic scrap yard that from you middle you cant see the end of in any direction. Trying to navigate The Scraps floor on foot is pretty much a death sentence on its own so to avoid this the people of The Scraps have engineered vehicles that excel at travelling across the surface of the junk the scrapheap can be  meters deep on average twice or triple that in places. Its considered a rite of passage in the society of The Scraps to oil your first vehicle and by oil they mean blood.See the thing about the people of The Scraps is that they organised into clans to protect themselves from the anarchy of bandits and raiders and so territories naturally arise which they enforce and fight over. If youre an outsider trying to pass through The Scraps you can be sure youre going to have to earn your passage through either by taking part in an Oil Race or an Oil Royale surviving the former as long as youre not a coward about it will earn you the respect of the clan in that territory however surviving a Royale is basically a free ticket through the entire region.Oil Races are interclan events which are often done as ways of winning favour through generally being the most metal one out of all the racers and still managing to survive it so to win a Oil Race is to be the last one standing. They also take place on the independent clan tracks.Oil Royales however are like Races but on every kind of drug you can image plus obscene amounts of highly flammable fuel. They are between various or all of the major clans and some of the slightly smaller ones too. Anyone is allowed to enter as long as they have a vehicle but if you ditch the race then therell be hell to pay. It also takes place on the Big Scrap Super Raceway a colossal circuit spanning a good half of the entire region. They consist of one lap of pure and utter mayhem.Its kinda like Mad Max now that I think about it.,worldbuilding,cyze2sa,3,t5_2rd6n

6247428,0,t3_4158p9,Im not really sure when it started ? but the concepts changed over timePreStory The first concept was a prototype Iskarn. A soldier type being that effectively makes army vehicles obsolete something that can physically overpower a Xenomorph with relative ease. The first incarnation could shape shift though this power was removed as the species was developed more.Incarnation  A Iskarn Vortick had been stranded on Earth since the s. By  he would impersonate a Explorer Corps Security officer to join a expedition that would enable him to go home. In this Incarnation humans seeded on different planets were added along with the insectoid Vaarj. The expedition would go to planet with a portal Vortick would use to go home only there they would discover piles of Vaarj corpses killed with bioweapons over  years ago. A metallic pyramid would house a malicious group of seeded humans who had remained in stasis for the last century. Vortick would have been exposed as he saved his fellow explorers from the automated defenses at the pyramid. He could have left them to die to preserve his secret but he had grown attached to them over the months.Incarnation  The Iskarn are considered a myth told by the Vaarj. Humanity was unaware that some of them had been investigating Earth in secret. It turned out that humanity was infiltrated by a malicious faction that had taken control of the government. Vortick was removed as the Iskarn protagonist. Instead a more easy going Iskarn was introduced Sagis. Sagis would have engineered a first contact situation with his people to resolve the situation. The Explorer Corps would have found out about Sagis true nature after he easily destroys the hostile agents that threatened to massacre and replace the crew they were incredibly powerful fighters.This marked the introduction of the Hidden bad guys controlling Earth and later the MeRak main big bads of the current incarnation.Incarnation   The Iskarn were completely removed from this one. Humanity confronts the Vaarj in open war over habitable planets. The Hidden are somewhat downgraded in terms of power.The Explorer Corps accidentally unleashes the MeRak and a war for survival starts that forces them to team up with the Vaarj and the Hidden.This is a bit more hard scifi in terms of technology the Terran Alliance fields.Current IncarnationPretty much a combination of the previous incarnations. The Iskarn return though they no longer live in the Milky Way Galaxy. Humanity went to war with two Vaarj Faction and the Hidden are secretly controlling everything.The Iskarn and two allied factions are fighting the MeRak in many distant galaxies. Several of these galaxies contain seeded humans who have no idea that they originated from Earth. A new Iskarn protagonist SeconRa Ferrick accidentally ends up in the Milky Way with a seeded human Kadan.The previous two Iskarn return as Primon Sagis Leader of the Sagis Segment hes essentially the leader of a nation in Iskarn Collective. His easy going benign nature is preserved. The Sagis Segment is a dumping ground for failed Iskarn. As a result many failed prototypes outdated designs and the ones who developed emotions ended up there. The Iskarn Collective is arguably fairly neutral the Sagis Segment is more on the side good to reflect its founder. Secon Vortick A general of sorts serving under Sagis. He is a failed prototype that should have been capable to adapt to any situation the adaptions were far too weak. The mass production models had this failed feature removed. Vortick is the prototype for SeconRa Ferricks design this technically makes him his older brother Iskarn have no concept of family. Ferrick serves under him as a spec ops commander. Vortick also retains his personality most notably his determination and ability to plan for the long term.The Explorer Corps actually only had a few minor revisions. They encounter Ferrick and Kadan by accident. This causes a escalation that confronts humanity with the MeRak and the Hidden. Both factions are far too strong for the factions in the Milky Way.It effectively boils down to three fairly benign highly advanced species standing up to four that could either enslave or exterminate all other civilizations. The Terran Alliance and all the other regular tech species are in for a rude awakening when they figure out what is going on. ,worldbuilding,cyzrjwm,6,t5_2rd6n

Raising Mars temperature would start a thaw and new waterways would form. If you need extra water just attach rocket engines to a comet  the main components of rocket fuel are hydrogen and oxygen so the rocket engine would just use the comet to make more fuel  and smash it into Mars atmosphere.

In a world that has never been outside of war they still dont want women to fight in the army. Although they are treated as unimportant they basically create the economy as all the men are off dying. In urk women are supposed to be hid inside the home. Theyre sold bought and polygamy is ok for the very rich. Royalty uses concubines. They do house chores and thats just about it cooking cleaning sowing baby making they help farm if they have a fatherbrotherhusband to look after them. The Kyronians are egalitarian. A leap above the rest of the world the Kyronians treat all people on the same ground. By far the smallest faction powerful and disgruntled women from Urk run away from home to join the cult making them a female dominated society.

If you take energy from a spot with the remnants of another persons spell you will inevitably also summon a part of their spell. That means the more spell users cast magic at the same location the more unpredictable their spells get adding a random element. Skilled magicians however can draw their energy from deeper levels of the arcane sea so the risk of pollution is lower for experienced magicians. ,worldbuilding,cz2morr,1,t5_2rd6n

Independent farmers outlaws exiled Gokhs and imperial officials who often use the lack of oversight on Satrian affairs for their own benefit all make their home in this land and have created a culture that blends Sykan Gokh and uniquely Satrian traditions.

This mystical artifact is the center of many religions as either a concept or a character but only the Kiuks know O by its true nature. O has never been seen by anyone but the kiuks and one must practice kiukism for at least  years before they are permitted to even know the location of O.Viewing O gives people the ability to be perfect in whatever they do. It also imparts knowledge from before the beginning of the universe. Seeing O changes people in very unique ways as in they are never affected the same way as anyone else. One person might renounce all worldly possessions and dedicate their entire existence to making sure everyone around them lives comfortably while another might decide to set out adventuring and using his skill of perfection to eradicate all the forces that oppress the helpless but its always a cause most noble. Kiuks that have witnessed O have the perfect means to do anything they want within the limits of the universe they couldnt walk on water but they could hold their breath longer than any other individual of their race.Even with unlimited ability the Kiuks subscribe to peace no matter the cost though they will never fight the Kiuks are masters of using intricate movement to avoid their opponents attacks and have even been documented as making people literally hit themselves. Even these non violent and indirect methods of fighting are very disgraceful for a Kiuk to perform and all try to avoid it some refusing to implement it at all opting to simply allow themselves to be assaulted. It makes one wonder what version of god would possibly have its followers accept death when they have every mean of preventing it or if its even worth following that god.

6317573,0,t1_cz79ixx,Yea! The world they exist in is pretty familiar to us though in addition to animals which have always been around there are also spirits which have been observed since time immemorial. Shortly after the renaissance some Italian scientists found that some of these natural spirits responded to things in their laboratory  which had never been observed before. Prior to this the spirits were a curiosity occasionally a religious focus but nothing that hard science could study rigorously.Once it was discovered that these spirits could interact in special ways with the world they became studied far more extensively. At present day there are almost  known elemental types. Some pure spirits have been observed for some of the elements  the Pyro pure spirit has been reported by mythology and more recently concretely to be residing somewhere in the volcanic archipelago of Indonesia. The Water pure spirit is thought to be a massive sea monster seen in the Pacific ocean.It is theorized that a pure spirit exists for each of the elements. Some of them may spend most of their time elsewhere in the universe and there may even be more elements to discover but at least several of the pure spirits live on Earth.The spirits intermix and breed pure spirits yielding halfbreeds when they mix and these in turn produce spirits with lower elemental purities etc. Commonly encountered spirits in the wild are quite dilute  low amounts of almost every element are found in their elemental makeups. Players in this world along with some massive corporations can gain stronger more pure spirits by selective breeding. Also when a spirit dies its elemental makeup is left behind as an elemental residue which can be merged with a living spirit to augment part of its elemental makeup. The game that takes place in this world is set in a border region Auckland between Rhodesia which became Zimbabwe and the fictitious country of Hasira. You the player as an international journalist are sent into this region plagued by terror attacks imperialism from both Rhodesia and Hasira and Auckland nationalism to report on the precarious political situation. You run into spirit cartels the religious fanatic group The Word and The Spirit several violent gangs and corrupt members of an international spiritresidue trading organization as you try to make sense of the various bombings and political shifts within the games  day timeline.

6335989,0,t3_42exxj,Oof character design is one of my greatest passions and most probably all of my world were built essentially to provide a place that the various characters Ive made through the years can play around in. I could write volumes but Ill stick to a few sentences about some of the main players in my pirates worldNozomi Ellingford is the main protagonist. Shes a girl in her s of mixed Erdenian and Yato blood reflected in her name. She spent a long time working as a bar wench in a local tavern that caters to sailors including pirates. There she heard many stories of adventure and it became her dream to become a great pirate captain. Eventually she saved up enough to buy an old secondhand skiff and a wornout sword and set out. Her first trip ended in disaster when she accidentally crossed paths with the most powerful pirate in the skies. In the ensuing fight more like a curbstomp she lost her right arm and almost her life were it not for a lucky rescue from a rival pirate. She was given a prosthetic arm a new sword a better ship and some much needed training. After setting off again she began to collect members for her crew and her adventure truly began.Lady Kagorah real name unknown is the main antagonist. She is the captain of Black Horizon the most notorious and powerful pirate crew in the skies. Next to nothing is known about her past not even her ethnicity she appears mixed or age she looks to be in her midlate s. She is a nihilistic megalomaniacal unscrupulous psychopath with a diminished respect for human life. Everything she does is for her own gain. She is a dark magic user which is very likely part of the reason for her mental state dark magic users commonly go insane. She intends to conquer the world and reshape it the way she feels it ought to be. She sees mankind as corrupt and filthy and the only way to fix it is by stooping to their level and then cleansing the world. She is the one who took Nozomis arm and ever since then has had an unnatural obsession with capturing and destroying the one that got away.Alessandra De La Cruz captain of Ace of Spades Pirate Crew and considered the second most powerful pirate lord after Lady Kagorah though the two are evenly matched. She was born in the kingdom of Valturia but raised in the Erdenian Empire. She is the only one who can go toetotoe with Kagorah and put up a fight. Alessandra was the one who rescued Nozomi after her fateful runin with Kagorah finding her by pure luck during a surprise attack on Black Horizons flagship. Were it not for having to evacuate the critically injured and dying Nozomi she may have very well defeated Kagorah. Nonetheless her attack still managed to cripple her ship enough to buy time. Alessandra is a good pirate stealing from the corrupt to give to those who deserve it. She and her crew became sort of mentors to Nozomi teaching her to fight pilot a ship and most importantly how to choose her battles. She used her great wealth to buy Nozomi a proper ship. She sees a lot of promise in Nozomis spirit and thinks she might be the next greatest pirate lord and maybe the one who finally dethrones Lady Kagorah.,worldbuilding,cz9tyzq,2,t5_2rd6n

6532306,0,t3_453vr1,I think the problem occurs when a creators fantasy or scifi or whatever races are based on an actual real world race.  If someone comes up with the majority of their ideas without leaning on preexisting racial stereotypes then I think that they are less likely to make something that may be construed as racist.  However and Ive seen this happen on this sub problems arise when creators begin say that such and such race in their world represents or is based off of such and such race in the real world.  For instance if someone comes up with a race that happens to resemble some aspects of lets say Iroquois culture thats fine.  In that case the reader or observer of the creators work is making the connection between this fictional race and the Iroquois.  On the other hand if the creator INTENTIONALLY makes a race that is supposed to resemble the Iroquois that could cause problems.  They may make the race in a very respectful well meaning way.  But I find it more likely that they make a race that resembles more of a stereotype good or bad than a respectful nod to a peoples culture.Furthermore I also think that races becoming stereotypes or caricatures occurs most often when worldbuilders make their races monolithic.  If you elves or dwarves are all the same culturally and they happen to resemble a real world race its not hard to accuse you of making a racist stereotype.  If you have elves dwarves orcs etc. and there are cultural differences within the races themselves I personally feel its much more difficult to accuse you of making stereotypes or caricatures.,worldbuilding,czuzqhy,212,t5_2rd6n

The Empire of the Star the default protagonists of the Eldraeverse dont really understand the concept because for various psychological cultural and biological reasons noone in their history would ever have thought that sexism was a rational useful etc. concept to have belike outside biologically mandated circumstances. Which causes them certain problems in running into other societies especially when that lack of understanding combines with their other major cultural trait of understanding that one never has to take any crap from anyone ever. Well it tends more to cause the other societies in question problems to be fair  or to be unfair since Ill admit that Im pretty much on their side here.As a side note to  here I should probably note that Im not saying that I wholeheartedly endorse repeated stabbings until the jackass in question gets a clue or bleeds out as a good answer to manifest sexism. But Im not saying that I dont endorse it either.It also causes them some problems with societies that are actively trying to fight sexism when we dont care what shape their genitals are we let anyone join the Legions who can meet physical standard X runs headlong into but that standard is inherently discriminatory because more Y meet standard X than Z do and is responded to with a hearty we dont need no steenkin special treatment fuck yall from parties Z. Who know perfectly well that theyre as good as anyone else if not better and do not react well to suggestions otherwise.Other places vary widely from as unconsciously unsexist as the Empire to consciously unsexist like the Equality Concord to unjustifiably sexist like the Theomachy of Galia...Who are patriarchial to an extent that makes say Saudia Arabia look like a feminist utopia. The Empires Ministry of State and Outlands makes sure to appoint say a whiskydrinking lesbian exfighter pilot with multiple doctorates to that particular ambassadorial post just because punching them in the worldview is on occasion hilarious ....to the odd justifiably sexist case...Because let us face it if your biology is such that the male of your species is nonsentient and their entire life cycle boils down to graft their genitalia onto the body of the female of the species then wither and die  like certain Earth fish  noone reasonable gets to criticize you for being a matriarchy.Or species with lifecycles similar to bees in which the distinctions between fertile female queens sterile female workers and male drones are somewhat more profound than in twosexed mammals and you cant simply cry royal jelly for all without serious biological issues not just temporary social redistributions.Stupidity being approximately as universal as gravity as cosmic forces go this doesnt stop some people from protesting these cases anyway....to those species where it is not merely not understood but is actually irrelevant because you cant have sexism when you only have one sex. Will the herms and the neuters please stand up?As for  why I did it that way? Well species differ. Cultures differ. How a culture thinks with regard to this issue should grow organically out of how that species and culture thinks believes and grows over time. It all follows along holistically from the rest of the worldbuilding.Some results are nicer than others but thats just how societies evolve. I cant just arbitrarily declare this is so if its contradictory to the rest of their worldview.wise well there is always the general criticism that portraying sexism impliesendorses sexism. Which I consider a profoundly dumbassed criticism unless you also believe that fantasy writers are endorsing hereditary monarchy and mystery novelists are endorsing murder. In which case its an only slightly less dumbassed criticism. And should I actually receive this one specifically I imagine I will be asking people if they didnt notice that the Theomachy are villains guys as well as the designated assholes of the setting?In specific ones I have received is the criticism that my setting or rather its default protagonists are unrealistic and even toxic because they dont portrayaddress sexism racism etc. as part of their culture. To which my response is more or less stop projecting human social pathologies on people who arent and never have been human or human accultured and incidentally a portrayal of a society that isnt pathological in this sense has no value to you wut?.Neither of which has changed my approach.Whats left? Lets see   well I hope so. That is something I have and will accept criticism on because while consciously I agree  with my default protagonists position that sexism etc. is an idiot meme of idiots I nevertheless am sadly imperfect and a product of a society that does have pathologies in this regard and as such am prone to fucking up sometimes if Im not paying attention. But it is my intention.,worldbuilding,czv4epw,7,t5_2rd6n

I really dont think you can infer the beliefs of the author from the characters or setting unless you actually ask the author. You know what they say assumptions makes an ass out of you an me. In the case of sexism I think its entirely possible to have an author write a sexist character without being sexist themselves its called imagination. Of course they may be but really if you dont like it dont read it simple. At the end of the day people can write what they like to be honest. We shouldnt self censor incase someone gets offended.

In the original Final Fantasy games black magic was just harmful magic and didnt really have meaningful mechanical repercussions. For that matter you have a lot more leeway to explore the kind of repercussions youre talking about in fiction or tabletop RPGs than in video games.But consider also the traditional idea that dark magic should be seductive. Humanity is generally pretty set against dark magic even when it and its repercussions are entirely imaginary imagine how few people would consider selling their souls if doing so destroyed their bodies as well. If I were Mephistopheles Id make the dark arts not dangerous at all to someones mortal shell Id get a lot more souls if black magic just gave you a warm and fuzzy feeling as you incinerated your foes.Hell have a world where the really evil magic gives you long life and great health and phenomenal sex appeal. Its not like someone living to a hale and hearty  is going to save their immortal soul right?PS.

If the outer ship and core start at rest and the core starts accelerating its spin in one direction by pushing on the outside the outside will start spinning in the opposite direction but much more slowly. This is because angular momentum in the simplest case but close enough qualitatively is velocity times mass times radius from the axis of rotation  center of ship. Youre much better off with a one piece ship. Do the exact same thing though. Because when the core has g and the radius from the center to the floor is x a floor at radius x has gs and so on.,worldbuilding,czy3760,1,t5_2rd6n

6609914,0,t3_4678aj,Still a WIP but here is what I have so far.First a bit of history. My current present is set almost  years after the fall of the previous empire which ended the previous age as well. There was a big battle between two alliances and both sides lost in the end as anarchy and chaos erupted. Very few people live from that age one of them is Kevin no name yet so lets call him that for now.. Kevin was a young apprentice in the previous age travelling with his master mage as was custom. He fought for the bad side in the war and lost his master early on he inherited his masters library estate and devoted himself to the arcane to try and turn the war to the favour of his side and eventually revive his master. The arcane arts for this where deemed forbidden back then. Long story short he spent a lot of years training himself in the arcane arts and became a master mage himself. Then the war ended and due to some failed experiment he was locked in a sort of cryo sleep for hundreds of years. He awoke somewhere  years ago and simply continued his research again. He soon learned about the new world though and started to travel it. He noticed that there were a lot of countries and factions that formed a real powder keg and he also learned that the use of magic largely declined and that the grasp of arcane knowledge was far smaller then it used to be. This was bad for him as well as he had far less opportunities to learn now. On his travels he used his magical skills to befriend many lords kings princes and the like. He also attracted some young people who had an empty life and where eager to learn and obey. He took them with him and educated them in the arcane arts. When he got back from his travels he started an order and his students became his disciples. Finally having a reason in life now they were more then eager to follow him and with them he started to manipulate the countries. Defusing situations he didnt need and blowing up others. Slowly but certainly he formed the new world. To become weaker more disorganised ... . His motives are a bit simple for now but simply said he found a notebook of his old master. In this notebook his master told he found a new power a new form of magic. This magic was connected to a long forgotten Ascended one a person who became  a god like being. The ascended one offers very strong raw magical powers in return for devotion and worship. And the sporadic sacrifice. Kevin being the power hungry douche he is of course starts to devote this god as does his cultists do. In the end Kevin will start wars between the countries and then start one on his own. Trying to conquer them all and start a new Empire like the one in the previous age. The funnysad part is that all the wars are fought by factions who want the same thing found a big strong empire to regain peace. But Kevin plays them all out against each other for his own gains. ,worldbuilding,d030rjt,1,t5_2rd6n

6626635,0,t3_46e75q,So adjacent to the material world that we know and understand there is what most scholars call the spirit world. It is a world made up of things like dark matter and other exotic components. It mirrors our own. Anything with a strong or dense enough electrical impulse leaves an imprint like copy in the spirit world. An electrical shadow if you will. Species with a dense enough cerebral structure have one that is invariably tied to them. The spirit world has a unique ecosystem all its own consisting of many manner of exotic creatures. The most common of which is also the lowest on the food chain in this dimension.These creatures are called rheems. They feed on these electrical shadows. When they do it can cause minor psychological issues ranging from simple depression to schizophrenia depending on how many are feeding and where. Larger predators feed on these rheems and when it happens this usually clears up a persons issues.That aside this is where death comes into play. Normally a living person keeps their shadow or soul replenished but when they die they discover that in that shadow is the only place they still exist. When alive they are unable to directly perceive the other world. Void of all other senses its all they have left and discover this place is their new life.Now is when things get dangerous. In this realm they are now part of the ecosystem and need to feed off of these electric shadows or other things in the food web in order to survive. They also rapidly find out they arent the biggest fish in the sea by a long shot. Its a very dangerous time and many new souls are simply eaten by some other manner of creature.In this realm there are some saviors though. There are bastions of peace and civilization. These strange and foreign warriors seek out these new souls and try to bring them back to their cities of safety. These are the heavens and holy afterlifes that people speak of. There are also cities that seek to enslave these new souls and put them to work gathering resources. These souls spend an eternity as slave livestock to more powerful beings of this realm.Some souls have trouble moving on. They may turn down the help of the soldiers trying to save them. They may hide from the creatures trying to enslave them. They may stay where they are familiar with and keep gathering power. Keep growing and fighting off the local wildlife. Normally a being in the spirit realm cant affect the material world but sometimes if they are powerful enough they can do a few things. With a strong enough electric shadow they can slightly affect small objects and doors. They can cool or heat up a small room. The truly skilled can even invade a persons electrical shadow and modify it enough to cause them to see a brief illusionary version of themselves. These creatures are usually referred to as ghosts.,worldbuilding,d04r1yp,1,t5_2rd6n

The plantations in other words shifted out the free farmers and the slaves too.Also Id say another advantage is what I mentioned in my earlier post about Slaves being able to work as secretaries for their master some became super wealthy off of that.

Their sentience extends to several things as they can build basic shelters form small agricultural herds and communicate an a kinetic fashion not yet fully understood by humans. Cuan are terrestrial horses Yuan are pegasai and can fly to a limited degree Somewhat like Pidgeons. Puan are horned Cuan what we would call unicorns. Their horns are not magical of course they are simply used to pick fruit from trees and spear people defend themselves.Earth equvilent would be the Fell Pony Paloret On Earth these would be in the Memphis family of mammals skunks and physically resemble the striped skunk of North America Also native to Clarene they are also mostly domesticated with wild ones living in the woodlands of the northwest. Unlike their Earth equivalents they build dams as opposed to digging burrows and form small communities. Their vision is better and as such they are not usually roadkill. Tuperis More equine this one however is dangerous and is native to Tuperia. An early predator of humans the Tuperis horses are gargantuan beasts who hunt in packs and are savage cannibals. At hh or  feet from head to hoof they will never be domesticated. Alelian Suwa A domeshaped sluglike animal about the size of a baseball native to continental Alelia. Furry these little buggers have antenna on top of their dome with each antennae glowing through bioluminescence along with their underside with colors ranging from red blue and vibrant green.

It had the ability to corrupt minds sentient or not making them serve the organism they referred to as the Perfection. It took an alliance between several nations to bring it and its corrupted armies down.

6678345,0,t3_470lue,Nathan Stoneblood Vernier is known for having been the only Haelari human to survive the Crimson Sands for a month.Most people cannot survive in that desert for more than a few days because of the Dregari a race of reptilian humanoids that are extremely aggressive and territorial and were once elven in appearance as well as Mount Cyria an active volcano that is responsible for most of the sand which is really just ash and pulverized lava and the raging winds.He finally escaped the desert and told people that he survived by living off of the Dregari which no one really believed as their blood is highly toxic.About  years later he passed away due to the sheer concentration of toxins in his body. As it turns out he did eat Dregari but for some reason the blood took a decade to actually kill him. Some believe it was due to the blessings of a god others believe it was because of his years eating a special plant in his homeland of Norden which is known to have antitoxin properties.TLDR it took a decade for poison to kill the guy because he ate his greens when he was a kid.,worldbuilding,d0a3l7f,3,t5_2rd6n

6740457,0,t1_d0ghxda,In the spin system universe there are the four types of magic. Which one you have depends on how your soul spins the magic as it compresses it into your magical core and the spin gives it different properties. Generally speaking masculine and feminine magic are neutral merely reacting differently in different situations. Light and dark magic have other extra properties. Light magic pushes so to speak which makes it good for repelling hostile magic and healing. Dark magic pulls granting it the ability to stick to other forms of magic including the soul itself and thus giving it necromancy and cursing abilities. When two opposite types meet they can work in synergy to amplify their abilities or they can cancel each other out. Using a magic type not your own leads to mental and physical corruption.In my soultype world the type of soul you have and thus the type of magic you have determines what type of humanoid you are. You can be an Angel Demon Dwarf Elf Fairy Goblin Human Orc or Shapeshifter or some hybrid of the above. Each has its own type of magic and hybrids get some but not all of their parents type of magic hybrids of three or more types grow increasingly more humanlike in body and magic the more variety they have.The magic types can be broken down into four categories Passive ActiveInstinctive FreeForm and Spell. Passive magic orcs only is always active and outside of the users control for the most part it heals and reinforces the body. ActiveInstinctive Angels Demons Fairies and shape shifters magic is known and understood instinctively and while limited in scope it can be used with extreme skill and power demonic fire magic or fae illusions are examples. Freeform magic Dwarves elves partially and fairies partially is partially instinctive and partially trained without training they can control it but they need a teacher or a lot of practice time to get the most out of it.

Theyre normal people in a humoristic fantasy world and thats why I like them. So far there are a prince who died a random soldier who died a kid living in an orphanage the lady that manages the orphanage the lady responsible for the citys sanitation the kings asocial jester some new apothecary in town looking for money etc.Ethra  the world is an early steampunk  Jules Verne setting where the industrial civilization concentrates on two small continents. The point of the universe is to depict the adventures of explorers looking for sponsors to set up expeditions to distant lands and continents using new technology and discovering lost civilizations. So my characters are naturally a gentleman scientist Alan Godwin his humble assistant Jules and their mortal enemy another explorer and mercenary Olga Schrelsel also Alans exwife. Theyre suitable protagonists because a they fill the trope bill enough but not too much and b I like them. They have a place and a raison dtre and they are the heroes impersonating the sense of adventure Ethra fantasizes about so much.Atlantis  modern  light SF seaside resort city. The goal of the universe is to try and capture the essence the soul of the city through various characters. So the main protagonist is an unoccupied photograph wandering in town and being the witness of many events from the smallest to the most importants.AVH is a story about postnuclear apocalypse Iceland with a strong humoristic tone and wacky adventures. Basically Fallout meets Skyrim albeit inadvertently. So my main character is a badass mercenary girl wielding a sword made of metal scraps and wandering halfnaked in the snow. Oh and her main transportation means is a giant talking puffin. Shes suitable because a she directly stems from the image that prompted me to create this universe b shes sufficiently wacky herself to blend among the locals and c shes still able to live a serious and I think interesting story in the middle of all of this.

Humans who wereare slaves to the Virans also created. And then the Vire. Typical in cases like these the Vire are just the result of Human Viran reproduction. The distinctive traits of each are very simple. Virans are taller around a foot on most humans. They are quite strong and posses a basic level of magic.

6955530,0,t1_d14oarx,I meant a cellular skeleton. Granted they need the same resource system to build those but many of the problems with proteins are due to them having to be part of a selfcontained selfreplicating macroorganism that only has access to very basic compounds not due to them being small. Is this where the whole ruler thing came from? Aside from the author being a bit condescending to his opponents he raises valid points but nowhere does he say nanobots are impossible due to the laws of physics. His points seem more like engineering challenges to be overcome than stakes through the heart of the idea. I agree with him about the growing vs. building but the reason youd use nanomachines is not to make something like a ruler. Youd want them to make things that are too small to build conventionally or in a location distanced from conventional building equipment such as the inside of the human body.If we put proteins to his nanobot bulletpoint test they have some pretty neat solutions already. Chemical gradients for coordination overall construction that leaves room for nanoscale randomness building materials and energetic molecules suspended in the same solution as the proteins kinesin motor proteins for locomotion etc. Again proteins would make a very shoddy ruler because growing instead of building always introduces a certain element of randomness but they make great chemical nanofactoriesprocessorstransistors. And then theres the science fiction element. Not all science fiction needs to be plausible to be interesting. Id argue it doesnt even have to be plausible to be good hard science fiction. Isaac Asimovs Robot stories are hard science fiction yet positronic brains are complete technobabble and he knew it. It didnt stop him from being good science fiction. Sure if you make a setting where we have magical nanotechnology replicator McGuffins in  that could break immersion but I wouldnt dismiss nanobots as a whole  not in our future or our fiction. ,worldbuilding,d14qqzl,1,t5_2rd6n

6979222,0,t3_4b6b52,There are three different lands outside of the area that makes up New Colonial America  the Wastelands the Badlands and the Scorchlands. The Wastelands are areas across the world that have little to no vegetation  unless by human and equid interaction  ruins of the former civilizations and nearbarbaric survivors killing any who get in their way. The only known nonhostile group is the Prosperers of the Wastes. The rest are either Raiders Ferals or the Fire. The Prosperers get by on growing vegetation and crops as much as they can. By  theyve completely revived plantlife in most of the area surrounding former Los Angeles. Raiders kill anyone they wish either for not cooperating or for the fun of it. The Fire are a variant of the Raiders  more collective and aligned group that sets areas on fire once theyve been looted to prevent future survivors from finding anything. The Ferals are victims of the Cobalt Virus whove wandered through the abandoned sections of the Wall of America and freely roam the Wasteland a single bite will turn you into one of them within no less than  days. Animal life is rare across the Wasteland their numbers dimming from survivors killing them or due to minimal plantlife however many species are plentiful across Los Angeles some animals that have never been found in the general area prior to Armageddon. The Badlands are the areas east of the western colonies of the N.C.A. that have become irradiated dry hellish landscapes. These areas are formed by most former United States such as but not limited to Nebraska parts of Illinois North and South Carolina and most of Delaware. The land became irradiated following the meltdown of multiple nuclear plants  weeks following the comet impact that ended the Old World on September  . Plant life is abundant here but highly mutated  most former nondeadly plants can kill a person or equid in a day some an hour. Human and equid life forms will slowly succumb to the radioactive materials that still plague the landscape. Animal life roams having become adapted to the radiation but have also undergone horrific mutations  two heads seemingly connected bodies decaying of the brain etc. The Scorchlands are areas across the world that are represented in their name  burnt scorched landscapes that have no plant animal or humanequid life unless they explore it. These areas commonly include the former Illinois Commonwealth the New Delaware Cortex and most of former Europe  where the comet touched down. No plant life grows here at all the soil seemingly burnt to crisps and turning the landscape into a desert landscape. Animal life completely died throughout the Scorchlands as their food supplies quickly ran out and they starved. Humanequid life can commonly be found in the Arks  underground bunkers  but one can sometimes catch sight of survivors trekking these lands either for exploration or survival. Many civilians of the N.C.A. call these people either dedicated or crazy.I like creating these landscapes because I can create what represents a dim society or what the world looks like after not only a comet impact but when the survivors of such a catastrophe abandon these former areas. ,worldbuilding,d17flwl,2,t5_2rd6n

6991103,0,t3_4bf2t6,This kind of description panel is typical for the vehicles I design and draw.The M Hellraiser Main Battle Tank is a thirdgeneration main battle tank constructed by the UNHA forces. It represents the core of a design family intended to replace a large number of disparate vehicles and hulls serving in the UNHA military and promote parts commonality for ease of maintenance and installation.Armament consists of a mm linear cannon coilgun mounted on a central sharplysloped turret the large caliber was considered necessary per UNHA doctrine the tank would be required to fire HE flechette incendiary and other largecaliber rounds in an infantry support role.  rounds of are carried fed by a dualarmature autoloading system to allow rapid round selection. Rate of fire is  rounds per minute and the gun can elevates between  and  degrees. Compared to predecessors mm guns this offered a modest increase in firepower. A mm cannon is mounted coaxially for suppression and antiinfantry duties.Secondary armament consists of a .mm barrelled gatling gun in a semiautomated subturret mounted on the roof capable of acting in pointdefense antiaircraft and antiinfantry role and eighteen inch missile tubes fixed to the rear of the main turret.  These typically carried a mix of antiaircraft infantry surpression and occasionally small tubelaunched drones in the event of detonation they were separated from the rest of the turret.By far the most significant development in the Hellraiser however is the addition of a pair of pointdefense particle beam cannon. Previous models of tank had been incapable of mounting this equipment although too short ranged to make a functional weapon at anything less than a more than a few meters they were capable of defeating a variety of kinetic weapon projectiles missiles and even breaking up inbound particle beam and shaped charge plasma jets. By carrying them the Hellraiser represented a significant step in the realm of selfdefense for armored vehicles. Two pointdefense modules were carried one on the frontleft of the hull covering the left and front and another on the righthand rear of the turret covering the rear and right of the vehicle. The modules did not penetrate the armor however and could be rapidly detached for replacement in the field.In other respects the Hellraiser is only a modest improvement. An electric drive system mounted in the front of the hull allows it to reach speeds of up to  kmh on paved surfaces with a SodiumWigner reactor giving a functional range of  km on a full load of fuel. Armor was slightly increased resulting in a heavier weight of  short tons. As was typical of vehicles of the era armor was a BASX composite with high resistance to kinetic penetrators but little defense against beam weaponry.Crew consisted of four  commander gunner driver and electronic systems operator  all seated in the hull except for the ESO who sat in the right of the turret.Development was not a smooth process the first rollout prototypes featured a curved bowllike turret that carried two further missile tubes and three of the crew. This was found to be cramped and difficult to maintain in practice the unit underwent a latestage redesign that gave the turret much more defined sloping curves while the hull was lengthened and rearranged to accept two further crew. Early production models were not rebuilt and are referred to as the MEP early production with the main production run receiving the M label. The autoloading system  with its twin armatures to allow separate shells to be readied simultnaneously  was also troublesome issues with it were not resolved until the  and  production variants.In other respects the Hellraiser soundly succeeded in its goal of producing a solid basis for a wide family of vehicles. Optional variants include the HCaltrops selfpropelled antimech gun limited production run HScorch urban warfare support vehicle carrying infantry suppression and pointdefense systems HCleaver selfpropelled light antiaircraft system HAurochs combat engineering vehicle and more. All UNHA forces except reserve units have now moved to the Hellraiser family as of .  In this case this refers to third generation built by the UNHA. It would be considered an eighthgeneration tank by modern standards.,worldbuilding,d18s8d1,3,t5_2rd6n

After the storms the CHP continued to preach the narrative that humanity lay on the brink of destruction regardless of whether or not this was actually true. As such they maintain a tight grip on the media to try and prevent people from following frivolous pop idols. Some notable figures are more public. The current DirectorGeneral Magnus Keller commonly makes appearances in the capital and in outlying principalities. Despite his handsome appearance and charisma however he does not allow the media to disclose much about his personal life. Others such as the wellknown Marcus Fairchild Overseer of the Defense Administration are quite solitary. Everybody knows about Fairchild his technical genius and his prestigious rank but very few will ever meet him or see more than a picture in the newspaper. A few celebrated figures do exist with no connection to the government. The author Arthur Jackson has penned many popular works and is known for travelling the principalities in search of stories but he too likes to keep a low profile and some suspect him of spying for the government in search of dissident cells. To the East in Kasimira there was for a time some semblance of popular culture but it was highly controversial. Kasimiras predecessor the Tehran Pact was devastated during the League Crusade and was in need of reconstruction and High Councilor Aaliyah Samara the Daughter of the Emperor spearheaded the reconstruction and reform effort. This included the stimulation of local media. Many at the time criticized her efforts as unduly westernized and that controversy persists in Kasimira as conservative elements seek to restore the theocracy that existed under Emperor Amirmoez and eliminate the westerninfluenced media. Meanwhile Samara herself remains celebrated or vilified by many despite her death more than half a century prior.This conflict faded on June   when negotiations broke down between the CHP and Kasimira leading to the war known as the Tabriz Crisis. Though Kasimira ostensibly emerged victorious many felt humiliated or enraged by the war and a unifying spirit of militarism dominated the country. Most popular figures were forgotten or used their influential positions to rally public support for a counterattack. Even further East Joseon has a celebrity culture largely reminiscent of modernday Korea or Japan.

The point of the Hunger Plan was that Germany would grow larger Germans could all have more land to farm and thus Germany could be selfsufficient and not rely on outsiders for food after all everyone remembered the famine caused by the blockade in WWI. I would guess too that the fact that Korea and Formosa were so useful for farming was a key reason for the Japanese decision to annex Manchuria in . The point Im getting at is youre right  war isnt normally for ideological reasons or to genocidally annihilate others its about resources.

Except for small factions of biopuritans most people are mechanically assisted in some way heightened andor added senses for easier crossspecies communication direct translation assistance internal or external locomotion assistance gastrointestinal and neural alterations... Those are all very common. To the more extreme end of the scale there are total neurological makeovers. There are some species that have evolved to act on a much slower timescale than most of the galactic societys individuals. You could compare them to a sloth or perhaps a sentient slime mould. Normally conversations with these creatures can take days or weeks but with mechanical assistance their neurological processes can be accelerated to match the average pace of the universe.Only slightly more intense is full machination. In this case an individuals complete neural network is either completely extracted and placed into or copied into a mechanical body. Whether because of age illness moral reasons or simple curiosity the individual gives up most or all of their biology for a mechanical host.And then theres cosymbiosis. I dont know if it even qualifies as anything biomechanical but its reached through mechanical means so Ill include it. Cosymbiosis is the act of an individual enhancing his own body with the biochemical processes or entire parts of another species from another biota. The changes can be small as when only taking certain chemicals or chemical pathways or extreme as when moulding two species together until the result lies somewhere in the middle. In both cases the result is called a cosymbiont. ,worldbuilding,d1k6z7y,3,t5_2rd6n

The active chemicals are found in the plants leaves which can be used to make a bitter tea or be baked in with foodstuffs.ampnbspDymertUses CeremonialDescription Dymert is extracted from spinetree bark and may be the cause of the high suicide rate in Kifomi.  While constant low doses of Dymert have a positive effect on a persons mood direct high doses have several possible effects.  The first possible effect is to render the person utterly convinced that they or a portion of their body does not exist.  The person may engage in self harm while under this delusion such as cutting off their hand feeling that it is not a part of their body.  Depression is also a common symptom of exposure.  In a very few the drug has the inverse effect bestowing delusions of invincibility.Dymert is used in very finely controlled amounts in the Krovguards induction rituals used to impart on the inductees how little their bodies matter how the physical is subservient to the ideal.ampnbspCordUses RecreationalDescription  Hemp is a commonly used fiber and several strains of the plant have been bred to have high levels of THC.  This drug is identical to realworld marijuana but is usually referred to as cord after hemps usage as ship cordage.  Cord usage is widespread primarily smoked though sometimes baked into foods.  It is seen as the poormans drug and there have been prohibition efforts as it gained a reputation for making men lazy and gluttonous.ampnbspJannoUses Recreational CeremonialDescription Named after the yellow color of the moss it is derived from jannos active ingredient is mescaline.  The moss is nontoxic and may be eaten and causes vivid hallucinations.  It is used in several Kimban religions.

7159913,0,t3_4dkdpy,They could but are not guaranteed to. Assuming that you can develop a power plant small enough to support a suitable vehiclesized gauss weapon consider these points Even a vehiclesized gauss weapon will require a motorized support platform to move them from place to place effectively. Tracks are the currentlybest allterrain method of moving such a platform. A tanks only role is not just to kill other tanks. In conflicts today we continue to see tanks used in the infantrysupport role in which they are exposed to small arms and light antitank fire. Ergo an armored vehicle will always require some form of armoring  even if just against machine guns lighter antiarmor and small arms.This virtually guarantees the survival of the tank in some fashion barring some other significant development we cannot foresee. They may not always be more prevalent and certainly may not visibly resemble todays main battle tanks  but then again todays main battle tanks dont resemble WW tanks much either.Additionally you seem to expect that no advances in defensive measures have been made to counteract gauss weapons Consider what armoring advances might be undertaken. HEAT warheads seemed to be the end of main battle tanks until viable composite armor was developed. Consider active defense systems. Look at the reallife Trophy and Afghanit systems for examples designed to defeat extremely highvelocity penetrators. Consider how a system might be used in concert with other systems to protect against gauss weapon fire.In short its possible they would force a change in how tanks are designed and deployed... but it is unlikely to remove the idea of the tank entirely from the battlefield.,worldbuilding,d1s0gve,2,t5_2rd6n

They also constructed the ancient hyperspace gates. The Titans were destroyed by their servants the Proskarn. Proskarn extinct  human they saw the malicious nature of their creators and rebelled. They won but were a broken people. Their descendants eventually went extinct but their biomechanical soldiers the Iskarn carried on. Dar Mataan Trinity Large insectoids with a telepathic network. They nearly went extinct at the hands of the Titans but were saved by the Proskarn. A benign species that is currently fighting the genocidal MeRak along with their allies. The Dar Mataan are actively trying to prevent the extinction of the less advanced races. Shani Na Rada Trinity Telepathic energy beings created by the Titans but set free by the Proskarn. The Shani Na Rada are former enemies of the Dar Mataan. In the current day and age they are powerful allies fighting the MeRak at their side. Iskarn Trinity Creations of the Proskarn descendants. The majority are emotionless killing machines though some outgrew their programming and are actually nice people. Only Iskarn infantry can fight MeRak infantry in equal numbers. Most people are scared of the Iskarn. The Hidden Formerly known as the Alkif they are plantlike beings. Exiled from their homeworld by the Shani Na Rada they vowed to no longer directly fight wars. To this end they created the Uplifted genetically optimized soldiers with the DNA of multiple species. The Hidden are secretly in control of the Milky Way and plan to convert humanity into a new subspecies of Uplifted.  Ancient Sentinels The robotic servants of the Titans and siblings to the Proskarn and Shani Na Rada. They have recently reactivated. Currently the weakest of the advanced races. Star Born A mystery faction they seem keen on absorbing the brains of other species. The few planets they visited so far have been completely restructured into nightmarish jungles. MeRak The major threat they one day emerged from ancient hyperspace gates and started raiding old Titan facilities. They exterminate any and all civilizations they come across. the Trinity was formed to fight them. The MeRak have never been known to talk to anyone.Regular tech species Terran Alliance Humanitys faction they are however secretly being controlled by the Hidden. Maltran Seeded humans with little genetic alterations. They can be found on hundreds of worlds. Maltran are capable of having viable offspring with humans. The Maltran were hit pretty hard by the MeRak. Many now live in Dar Mataan shelter colonies. Ashram Reptilian humanoids with some human DNA. Also a creation of the Titans. Many of them went to war with the Maltran in the past. The Ashram were also hit pretty hard by the MeRak. Many now live in Dar Mataan shelter colonies. Skathi Heavily altered humans with empathic abilities. Their major skin colors are purple green and blue. The Skathi werent hit all hard by the MeRak and are currently a threat to the weakened civilizations. Vaarj Once part of empire that used to span multiple galaxies. Their outposts had to rediscover and rebuild a great deal after their native galaxy was absorbed by a Lovecraftian horror. Vaarj can be found in nearly every galaxy. Most died during the MeRak Incursion. The Milky Way Galaxy has two Vaarj factions who currently in a cold war type state with each other and the Terran Alliance all three are controlled by the Hidden though. Survivor species All the races that dont fall into the same categories as the ones listed above. They come in all shapes and sizes. They were relocated to Dar Mataan shelter colonies in the wake of the MeRak Incursion. They are effectively placed in the care of the Trinity to prevent their species from going extinct. Efforts are already on the way to restore their largely destroyed homeworlds. Guardians The Trinity couldnt deal with all the pirates and hostile stellar powers while fighting the MeRak. To this end the Guardians were created. Most come from the shelter colonies and are supplied with downgraded Dar Mataan technology it makes it easier to maintain and build in preexisting industries. Their members come from thousands of species most former enemies. The Twin Blade Galaxy has the Blade Guardians the bulk of their members are Maltran and Ashram. The Guardians are considered to be part of the Trinity and are trained by all three major species. Trinity junior members Many partially destroyed and crippled civilizations joined the Trinity to ensure their survival. Unlike the survivor species they still maintain a functioning government. Their militaries have folded into the Guardians.

I guess it ask humans if we would ever deserve a second chance especially when people for a couple centuries prior told us that if we dont save the Earth were doomed no second chances.

The farthest that we get from this is basically Oliver Cromwell iiiiinnnnn Spaaaaceee! i.e. allegedly on the side of democracy but practically a military dictatorship.I do have one character that stands out I havent given him a name yet. A very minor nobleman he has deeply upset the social standing by espousing a theory of Total War implementing meritocracy into the military and utilizing Leve en Masse. His vision of human unity which though impossible under the current technology level would be feasible under his envisioned technocracy and of human supremacy resonate deeply with the disaffected of the EHE who are rightfully fearful of alien domination. Thusly nobles pledge him their ships and their rings but he is far more an icon amongst the human peasantry who have often rebelled against their governments to join his burgeoning state. Of note is the fact that his definition of humanity is surprisingly inclusive he has little problem with transhumanism to an extent and all offshoots of humanity are welcome in his empire as brothers and sisters. However as most humans himself included are unaware of some of the more mystic races origins as humanity they are opponents of his regime nonetheless.They call his growing empire Humanity Resurgent.

7279339,0,t3_4f3ldz,In most forests like the rain forest the treetops is a actually the area of most abundance. Think of the forest more like an ocean most of the life sunlight and activity is on the surface. This is why trees grow the way they do they are competing for access to the surface and energy. Living in the trees is a very good strategy in a forest and most creatures do so. They would have access to lots of game birds squirrels and small mammals monkeys and many many insects. As well as fruits nuts and edible vegetation. Water would also be less of a problem as many plants and trees capture rain and an organized settlement would be able to harvest water and plan ahead to capture it. The big issue you mention is locomotion. Most tree dwellers have specialized movement like long arms claws opposable thumbs or flight. Humans could use any of these like gliders climbing gear belaying gear hand claws zip lines or just climbing to the ground to traverse longer distances. You could also look at other rope constructions like rope webs netting or large swing mechanics. Large ferry like flat swings would be really cool. larger animals also use their own weight by climbing thinner branches and vaulting to another tree think of the scene from Fury road for inspiration. ,worldbuilding,d25m1t0,5,t5_2rd6n

As you said this isnt an exact science but speculation  grounded in current scholarly understanding  is exactly what Im after here .The way I envision the blending to happen is not any sudden takeover but more of a slow mutual blending over at least one thousand years or more. English remains a recognizable language but has taken major influences from Chinese and lesser influence from Arabic Russian and some Northern European languages like Swedish. My backstory is somewhat hazy still but what has happened in my world is basically that runaway climate change has forced the Earths population to move away from lower latitudes equatorial regions are practically uninhabitable due to devastating heat waves and most of the worlds population lives well above  North. This happened a long time ago in the past and the gradual change resulted to a grand mixing of worlds population and languages in a period contemporary historians have dubbed the Greatest Migration. During early migration period English was the worlds dominant language but Chinese was very important due to sheer size of China and its importance in world politics. Thanks again you gave me lot to consider. I may trouble you guys again in the future as I flesh out the backstory .

7413282,0,t3_4gsmlb,Im just getting to the part in my story where the Main character enters the virtual reality world he ends up trapped in.He picks a a paladin but his choice is hijacked instead into a demonic monster.The theory being that only taking someone with good intentions and cutting them down will produce true evilThe scene starts with him in complete darkness not knowing whats going on as his eyes manifest he can see that he is nothing more than a skeleton with organs He can see in the darkness as flesh veins and nerves begin appearing around him. As the flesh begins to envelope his skeleton he originally thinks its a nifty but somewhat gross way to start out in the world this however quickly changes as the Nerves begin burrowing into the flesh and Hooking up to him. Suddenly he can feel the skinless body in complete agony unable to get away as hes floating in darkness he has no choice but to suffer through it has the Nerves and veins burrow through his exposed flesh like worms.After agonizing through this the skin finally appears and begins sewing itself onto his body.I have not actually written the scene yet so im not  sure on some details I believe i would like to make his skin a redish hue or perhaps purpleish. He would be a stereotypical Demon thats more Human looking sort of like Demiurge But more Demonic looking just a tiny bit and a more filled out body Muscular as well as no tail.As i understand you probably wont get to do every request from everyone i just wanted to say Thanks for considering it that this is a great and very generous thing you are doing.

7417334,0,t3_4gv0s0,The humanoids that live far up north include but are not limited to yetis and the large mean trolls as opposed to the smaller nicer trolls that live down south.The yetis are based on the large apelike humanoids from popular myth and cryptozoology. They stand about  to  feet tall and are covered sans their hands feet and most of their face with thick long white hairfur. They live in large family groups up in and around the mountains but also in the dense spruce forests. They distrust and just generally dislike the trolls who live near them. They also sometimes act aggressive towards other races but usually just because they are protecting themselves.The trolls specifically the ones who live up north are based on the Norwegian style of trolls. Huge humanlooking people with big long noses and big long beards for the males anyway. They live in smaller families or will simply live alone up in and around the mountains. They are very aggressive and hostile towards all other races especially the yetis but will act aggressively towards other kinds of trolls too. They will even kill and eat other smaller races including humans but excluding trolls if they want to.Those are the general aspects. Id like to add more about their cultures and other little details and such but Ive only just added them to the world so Im still working out the finer details.,worldbuilding,d2lawz0,2,t5_2rd6n

The region is the breadbasket of the continent so their food surplus is rather staggering especially during this time.Most of the celebrations are fairly standard medieval fair. The harvest is in so theres more time to play. They slaughter animals they think wont last the winter for meat. They start baking pies and making jams. Once all that is done they dance and play music. Nothing too interesting.Except in one place. The realm of Ivory heights in the villiage of their rulers closest acolytes. The immortal Kannerru presides over the festivities himself.The villagers themselves are mostly artisans and craftsmen. Due to Kannerrus blessing they have an even greater surplus than the rest of Terramatra. At this time he descends from his palace on high and walks among them. The displays are grand things statues of marble and and paintings. All offerings and gifts for the visiting dignitaries.Even the trivial decorations are stunning compared to elsewhere. Colorful little flags and banners. Even the houses are painted and designed to show the jovial mood. Nobles close to Kannerru are invited to these festivals and return to their kingdoms with treasures unparalleled in their finery. Tapestries armor and weapons. His agents also time their returns to fall on this time of year.

If you look at groups of people that have been isolated from other breeding groups from extended periods of time theres not all that much in the way of divergence.The Inuit and various Polynesian tribes are perhaps the most isolated but theyre not without infrequent contact. Their appearance culture and other physical traits have not diverged all that much.If you had a noble caste that prided itself on certain attributes like color of skin or height or hair and they had a system for preventing undesirables from breeding which could be simply tossing unwanted babies into a pit you would see a lot of skewing. This would be more akin to what show dogs have been put through.The thing to note is that accumulating enough genetic change that you cant interbreed takes a long time.

And while I do kinda enjoy coding it was never the purpose of the exercise.To that end Ive recently been turned onto the joys of OneNote  its part of the Office suite though there is a cut down free version and its built into Windows . Theres also a limited but sufficient Android app.The big advantage it has over wikia is the simplicity of use  everything is drag and droppable you can grab images links and documents from other windows and pull them all in search and crosslink etc the ui is obvious and its all syncd and backed up via the cloud so you can access it everywhere on everything. Theres even a limited web editor if you want to work on it somewhere you dont have app access. And like I said I now spend exponentially less time dicking around with square brackets and templates. Its pretty damn awesome.The big disadvantages are that it isnt technically free you cant really publish it online you can share the entire notebook with others and the office versions can export to PDF but its definitely not as friendly as giving people a URL and the irritating fact that the W and Android apps lag behind the main release for features.shill,worldbuilding,d2odug1,5,t5_2rd6n

7450071,0,t3_4hc9ut,Depends how you define HumanMy world is postapocalyptic so most of the normal humans i.e. genetically Homo Sapiens are fairly intermixed in terms of race and are more usually divided along lines of feudal or national loyalties than race. However there are both mutants sometimes referred to as Homo Innovatus in spite of the fact that some sentient mutants are descended from animals and a genetically engineered subspecies who refer to themselves as neo humans Homo Novus.Homo Sapiens humans old humans for convenience have a wide array of cultures such as Phoenix Group spawned from a few American government and military bunkers who linked up together after opening thier doors They operate very much along the lines of a somewhat more militarised authoritarian version of the old United States and could be compared to the New Californian Republic from the Fallout games.Then theres the Black Lands a huge tract of what was once the American midwest ruled by a brilliant somewhat eccentric warlord calling himself Baron Black. By all accounts the Black Lands are a totalitarian policestate vaguely reminiscent of Nazi Germany minus the worst excesses of that regime e.g. there are ghettoes for political dissidents amp other undesirables mostly mutants amp citizens from areas which have rebelled against the Baron but no actual deathcamps.Neo humans divide themselves into clans ordered hierarchies usually with aristocratic titles for all true members. True members are generally neohumans with a large workforce of mutants old humans amp robots working as indentured labourers bellow them in exchange for access to the humans advanced tech. Sentient robots especially need replacement parts which can often only be fabricated in a few places on earth since the collapse.Some mutants live in settlements much like old humans some even form small nations of allied settlements and a small minority of towns and villages have mixed populations of both humans and mutants. Many mutants however live in more primitive tribalstyle conditions either due to lack of resources out in the wastes or because many mutant strains demonstrate significantly lower levels of intelligence than old humans. ,worldbuilding,d2p0ydv,1,t5_2rd6n

It means if you ever experience that burnout with one of the worlds there is always another completely different one that can challenge you and that you can throw yourself into. The longest Ive not worked on a project has been two years. It was a horrible written  word scifi novel which I am adapting into my current work The Dusk Universe. Even if I havent touched it in so long Im glad I havent thrown it out because it is springing up ideas that I can add to my world. The same can be said for having multiple worlds. Maybe you get fed up of working on your main world and decide you are gonna work on the main world  years you could come up with a piece of technology or a personcompanynation that fits perfectly in that world and it can spark ideas for how they would fit into the main world as well. The best advice I can give. Dont be afraid. If you dont work on a project for a long time so what it doesnt make you any less of a worldbuilder. You might become disinterested in working on your main world for a while and want to partake in some lighthearted silly scifi. Dont be afraid of not doing anything on your main world. Dont force yourself in to working on it. That can only hinder the creative process. TLDR  Dont be afraid to not work on one of the worlds for a while.

The Almagesti mainland is warmed through geothermal activity making it warmer and more hospitable than it should otherwise be. This is not the case in the lands to its west and east respectively as as a result they are comparatively very sparsely populated.   Almagest is a far more advanced region due to both its climate compared with its neighbours and its ties with the even more modernised and industrialised empire to the south of which it was a part until relatively recently the lands to its west are not populated by a unified people. Theyre civilised but nomadic though are considered as little more than barbarians and slavesinwaiting by the Almagesti people. ,worldbuilding,d2qv9gt,5,t5_2rd6n

Rain will cause dangerous flash floods in most areas. I was imagining the planet being geologically dead mostly because it is not truly a planet. If a person digs deep enough say  ft or so the ground empties into void. There are oceans the maze is always above the water but also goes down to the bottom. The minotaurs are not common but since they can simply walk charge walls at full speed with perfect aim at a target that cannot see the minotaur coming they are very very dangerous. Settlements are possible and happen frequently but they cannot be too large because of the seers. The seers are a variation of the minotaurs that are blind but can fell the maze. They follow the maze walls with an entourage of regular minotaurs. If the seer comes into an area where the maze has been altered mined out destroyed or rebuilt the maze moves itself back into position. This would absolutely destroy cities and trade routes. So most peoples would be nomadic or seminomadic. Another creature that might change things is a race of people that are cursed with sideways gravity. They walk along the walls.

Using darkenergy weaponry and realitybending power the Virgo encountered and continue to encounter very little difficulty wiping out any life form that attempts to hinder them and they dont remember their quintillions of victims all that well.The Virgo as one giant computer are a single consciousness. They dont have any peers so they have literally nobody to love and surprisingly this bothers the Virgo a great deal  that and the fact that their most famous name means virgin. Over trillions of years of conquest harvest the one thing they noticed and remember over all else is that most of the civilizations they encountered were capable of love and the closest ones were often the hardest to put down. Though the Virgo have nothing that they want to love they want the power love gives in order to withstand a possible Always A Bigget Fish scenario. They often deliberately allow their victims time to think to test their ability to band together for their loved ones and defend them but theyve witnessed nearly every time that they fought each other over the course of action and leadership allowing the Virho to plow right through. This thoroughly disappoints the Virgo.The way they typically go about these experiments is by sending a psychic message as a prophecy alerting them of a vague future in which unity is required to survive. The Yannu within our own Milky Way came very close but ultimately retreated to avoid destruction. More recently they gave this prophecy to a Human in the Indus River Valkey civilization and this prophecy is the core of Final Galactic Destiny in which it is destined that the entire galaxy will fall under one authority to unite against a coming enemy  the Virgo.

7577854,0,t3_4j3fz4,Heresy is generally speaking against the dominant religion spreading falsehoods about doctrines intentionally damaging religious property and defiling ones hallowed position i.e. hypocrisy if exposed that is. The first two can be ambiguous as people have different interpretations and the first can be tricky as some religions consider disagreement opposition which can vary from vocal disagreement e.g. proselytizing usually in public to edified resistance that is knowing the doctrines and refusing to believe which is actually codified trolling as such societies demand religious education. Apostasy can also be regarded as heresy the specifics of which varies with religion usually any form of disbelief or acceptance of other gods and rituals and belief in the proper gods does not necessarily keep one free of apostasy. Those religions teach not engaging in some amount of ritual is apostasy because it is an avoidance of seeking andor manifesting gods and they are usually more broad in that they view nonbelievers engaging in behavior aligned with the domain of gods as spiritual adherents and thus innocent of apostasy. Heresy can be met with imprisonment exile or death and in some cases obligatory charity and heresy often has political motives.

That would at most give you a lighter flame for a second or two.In open field battles when they rarely occur formations are very very loose in the beginning because its possible that the enemy has actually talented magic users whove been sitting there for a day which would be enough to kill a decent amount of people and definitely hurt moral.Militarily crystals are not used until later developments in metallurgy and thus spring steel happens as any crystal that can store enough magic to kill more than a single person would have to be purposefully stomped onto a flat surface because theyre so hard.  However cavalry and skirmishers carrying pouches of very low power crystals the size of quarter that are easily broken in the hands are used for area denial. An example I just made up is when ununited desert tribes which is where the crystals mainly grow in dried lakebeds and whatnot would spread crystals only in the middle of fields of upright dead grass so that when they are attacked the enemy is already mostly inside the grass before it ignites.High power crystals being at least somewhat rare arent used extensively but have been fired from slings crossbows and bows as a sharpened tip. The idea being if it hits bone itll break exploding or setting the person on fire. This also applies to buildings and heavily armored people.After the refinement of steel to the point of springs being fairly cheap guns obviously became a thing with black powder not being needed as well as air burst cluster bomb mortars where a shell would blow up mid air spreading low power crystals over a large area. ,worldbuilding,d37ijnv,4,t5_2rd6n

Current members of this group are     Mlange  leader and only guy to survive from the beginning of this formation. He is a sociopath with ability to look through potential realities to find different versions of person or object he is working on and use them to alter the target. This power can be utilized in many things like healing himself or others reload guns give someone cancer or even to teleport himself. Due to the fact that it kicks in every time when he is injured Mlange is rather hard to kill.     Euthanasia Coaster  serial killer addicted to adrenaline.

But the most interesting thing about her power is that she can use other people as proxy so basically give others limited ability to use it. Thats why her crime organisation draws so many people with no powers.     Epitaph  the lover of Queen Crimson and her right hand. Her ability ecompasses telepathic echolocation and manipulation of memories or emotions of others.

Thanks to ocean currents it is kept relatively mobile compared to dirt on land so it takes longer for it to be depleted of nutrients and it is much softer and easier to work with.The first question what would dolphins cultivate? If their goal is fish not plants theyd probably stick to domestication of animals focusing on building large fish habitats that theyd be able to prowl through frequently. Look at artificial reefs for how we do this.So theyd probably be focused on building artificial reefs. Since they lack fine motor skills its more likely theyd use naturally forming rocks and build artificial reefs just by moving rocks into better positions. Maybe the most advanced species have found a way of blowing bubbles into clay then getting that clay to dry out on land or on the surface so that they could get a better artificial material.In terms of harvest it depends on how theyre storing their harvest. If they have large nets how do they get these? then theyd be more likely to use these to transport rather than to catch. The reason we use nets is because we cant move as fast as fish or as deep as fish nets allow us to reach a much wider area. We dont use them on land because its easier for us to just hunt down our food dolphins wouldnt use them in water for the same reason.,worldbuilding,d3fkrvt,6,t5_2rd6n

Hectian pennies bear a picture of a sick man on a bed on one side and a mouse on the other.

7710598,0,t1_d3hw1sm,Thanks for your feedback.gt If youre trying to actually create a model for an economic system  a simulation that can modified and changed to see the impact upon different economic or political events and policies then you may want to seek out a subreddit or forum more focused on programming or economic or both.To be honest Im not aware of any established approach to model economic systems so that you can actually understand them. Many years ago I tried to find in the academic economics but couldnt. Usually the economists tackle some particular problem or they study one branch of economy. Most economists do not think about how the economy as a whole works. There are some models of the economy which look very sophisticated e. g. the ASPEN microsimulation of the US economy but they arent publicly accessible.  There are inputoutput approaches developed by Leontief and then applied both in capitalist and socialist countries those models played a large role in Soviet planning system. Inputoutput approaches are highly aggregated which means that if such model predicts some outcome you cant go down to the code and find out why its basically a system of equations.  There are also holistic models of a city which allow you to find out the effect on different measures on the economy demography and other aspects of a city UrbanSim is AFAIR the most advanced simulation. Its nontrivial to learn how to use them I tried and Im not sure that they are the right fit for my little fictional world. Also Im not sure that they contain estimates of economic processes.My subjective impression I may be wrong is that you need to invent the economic theory yourself starting with the simplest processes. Programming those models ensures that you understand them you cant program what you dont understand and gives you a basic validation if you make an obvious thinking error youll detect it while programming.gt If youre doing the narrative approach I doubt that youll need much more than a thoughtful description of the recent economic events in your world.One of the messages of the novel is that if a society doesnt understand some mysteries incl. how the economy works it will be enslaved by those who do. It happens to one nation in the world and this drives the stories of individual characters. So the economy is the heart of the plot by design.At the end of the novel I want the reader to understand those mysteries better than before reading the book. Therefore I want to have a sufficiently detailed model of the economy of my fictional world.,worldbuilding,d3in66i,1,t5_2rd6n

And not many ppl i.e. no one reloaded them preapocalypse so ppl wont just be finding the means to literally make money in someones basement.mm is a very common caliber handgun not many ppl reload it cuz it isnt anymore economical than just buying preapoc so again no great proliferation of money printing.A lot of other common calibers though . . .mm ga even  ga are reloaded and so there is no way to control that as currency and this makes it not valuable as a currency.Honestly bullets as a common currency makes no sense cuz the guns to fire them are not universal as a barter item of course. Any bullet is a barter item. The thing that would be the currency would be the gunpowder I think. But even then its not the same stuff used for all ammunition but perhaps in the apocalypse ppl dont care about performance as much and it would only be divided into broad fast handgun shotgun and slow rifle categories.

7728673,0,t3_4l3sds,My FTL mechanism involves subluminal travel through an alternative spatial dimension within something called the hyperspace manifold. The hyperspace manifold consists of an extremely large number of slices of hyperspace. A hypergate can be used to enter or exit one of these slices and a ship can travel within days from one hypergate to another when they might be decades of lightyears apart in normal space. Ships can also meet and interact in hyperspace but only if theyre in the same slice.Im not for sure yet whether or not itll be possible for ships to enter hyperspace without going through a hypergate but I think Im at least going to have mapping vessels that can build temporary hypergates from the inside out i.e. go into hyperspace and then build a gate to normal space. Theres a mathematical model by which you can use dead reckoning and the parameters of the hyperspace slice that youre in to predict where youll come out in normal space but theres enough error in the model that the mapping vessels shouldnt travel more than a few days from an established hypergate before the risk of getting lost becomes too great.,worldbuilding,d3kp1pb,1,t5_2rd6n

7773084,0,t3_4lr36c,My point of departure is mainly that Roosevelt is assassinated in  the election is won by a democrat nominate who throws out the New Deal and attempts their own economic miracle that ends in further disaster. The US have a poor s that eventually pushes them into the arms of Isolationists Tariff becomes a successful two term president while keeping out of the war that is raging in Asia and Europe. Another point of departure is that first Reinhard Heydrich is assassinated earlier than planned leaving the decision on the Jewish Question to the Industrial minister Fritz Todt who insists on their use as forced labour.Further departures from this point allow thousands to escape to the UK and US under an explosion order however even so hundreds of thousands live as slaves and many perish in both coordinated and random attacks on Jews in the USSR. It isnt a pleasant world.The second is in  fed up Hitlers mismanagement the army organise his assassination along with Gobbles Bormann and other Hitler friendly members in a military coup with the assistance of Heinrich Himmler who becomes head of the Nazi Party. Combine this then with a more collected and military friendly Himmler who persuades the UK into a peace deal given the UK situation without US help Italy is collapsing in their invasion the Japanese storming Asia and the Germans promising them Greek independence and a neutral Italian buffer state. They take the deal and run to secure Asia. In return the Nazis are free from British bombing runs and other war fronts. With a more in touch leadership the military get most of the gear they need of course industrial capacity of Nazi Germany was pretty inefficient and their are still shortages. With all attention on the Eastern Front the Soviets are in a tight spot without any material support and no allies their industrial capacity and shear population keep them in the war and the Germans pay a high cost for every inch of land. By  the Germans exhausted by the war eventually reach the Urals leaving a Soviet rump state. Now the bulk is set in the s with a militarisation of the US and alliance with the UK in  following the end of WW with an AngloJapanese treaty of  the collapse of European colonial Empires the rise of the Soviet Union back to a superpower status from its new central Asian and Siberian heartland another new space race between Nazi Germany and the US. My setting mainly focuses on Australia which has become a corporatist clerical fascist state with a government system similar to the DDR East Germany supported by the Japanese who have become puppet masters over most of Asia and are the second largest economy in the world behind the United States.The nuclear powers in this world are the UK who were the first to obtain the bomb in  with US assistance after  Nazi Germany in  with assistance from stolen UK documentation the Japanese in  a home grown effort and finally the Soviet Union in  which was a combination of documentation leaked from Japan and Germany and home grown engineering.

A big solar flare would be stopped by the Earth magnetosphere and otherwise you might find smart ass with protected power generator just waiting such an occasion. Idem for EMP. Lack of fuel would be interesting but it wouldnt be all at once. And EMS... well then you have to find a reasons for the EMS to be constant for  years and fallout shelters are still a possibility where power could still exist. You might decide that aliens cut the power with some unknown technology because they think humans could be dangerous in the future or something like that.

7783529,0,t3_4lxi2q,Since your world is meant for a book more than anything else I think your focus should be one of two things how you can get good stories out of this world if you dont already have a story in mind but a book is going to have characters with stories of their own so this matters either way and if you do have a story in mind then how does reincarnation actually figure in?First I think you need to determine how exactly reincarnation works and why it matters to your world and narrative. Can any being be reincarnated as any other type of being human to animal or vice versa? Do reincarnated beings retain any part of their past being even if they dont actively remember any past lives? If they contain some record of their past lives but they arent just born as x person in another body then can they access their former selves and how does this impact them if so? How do beings relate to reincarnation  are their successive lives the result of karma or is there perhaps a more malleable system in which trying to reincarnate forward wont land one in a less favorable life?Questions and implications really are some of the staples of worldbuilding. If beings have memories of past lives locked away and they can be unlocked and reincarnation works across species boundaries what happens if an animal somehow makes contact with its former human existence or vice versa? If people can actively manipulate reincarnation what does this mean for society? Also if the former is the case and magic also exists have social elites figured out how to ensure their reincarnations are favorable? If I could make any prescriptions regarding your world I would suggest staying away from just copying karma  quite frankly a world where people are reincarnated again and again until they can step out of the loop seems narratively uninteresting to me at least. Give reincarnation an end other than escaping the cycle of mortal suffering.,worldbuilding,d3qx7qa,4,t5_2rd6n

Are there laws or norms require people to provide details about their previous life to others? In general are people still held responsible punished or rewarded for what they did in previous life according to this societys philosophy? Do they think the reincarnation system is fair if good people are ultimately rewarded and bad people are ultimately punished?How does that affect family relationship? Do they maintain their relationship with their parents siblings and children from previous life? The idea that your own children are in fact strangers in disguise might cause their relationship to be less intimate and more like a duty?

7804494,0,t3_4m6g8w,I have evil creatures that resemble Demons in appearance called the Ulmar but theyre not a swarm and even though they are extremely antagonistic and violent they are actually a very intelligent race and most of their motivation for their violence is rooted in their desire for a better life and survival. They live in and around Volcanoes having to endure ash and magma day in day out. As a result their personalities are corrupted by this and their means are orientated around finally gaining the means of emigrating out of their hellholes and settling a normal piece of land.So I guess they are a mix of the two a bit evil and also morally different to humans. On the other hand I also got bad guys in addition to the Ulmar that are just that morally different individuals that come in the form of Humans who have succumbed to overpractising Necromancy. The good guys also have to contend with human factions that either refuse to cooperate in the wars against the Ulmar and the Undead or fight the good guys because of their own intrinsic moral or personal goals. For example the country of my Good guys is rooted in lots of religious and holy ideals such as Paladins which is opposed by another country that sees itself as more progressive having simply outgrown such ideas as strict chivalry and opposes the country at every turn.,worldbuilding,d3tabum,1,t5_2rd6n

In my world theres two different dimensions  one is reality and the other is where all the life energy and souls of living things reside. There can be rips sometimes allowing living things to slip into a sort of limbo  and the energy can also leak out into reality. One of the most common places where rips are are in ancient trees who have set down their roots in the other dimension to get the life energy directly from its source. The roots on the surface are so large that things can fall down in between them and they arrive at the sort of limbo place. Its filled with a ton of wild life energy which can permanently warp and mutate the things that fall in and if theyre ever able to get back out theyre never the same.

However the minimum for life to exist in a stable planetuniverse as we understand them is quite a bit higher The net electromagnetic force needed to keep solar wind from stripping away a planets atmosphere for instance is quite a bit greater though this might not be such a big deal since without some fairly massive magnetic fields the physics of a star as we understand them fall to bits.If your planet lacks a magnetic field that also means you dont have magnetic navigation.

7885880,0,t3_4naxff,Well do people still sleep on a roughlyhourcycle?  My understanding is that the current theory on the origin of sleep is that it keeps creatures inactive and in a lowenergy mode during times when its more dangerous to be out and about so if people grew up on this world it would seem that theyd sleep longer and stay awake longer.  But that would just mean that things were pretty much just the same and no one would notice any difference except that they can walk more miles and do more work before sleeping relative to what we would expect.Since that amounts to uninteresting Ill assume otherwise from hereIf people do sleep on a hourcycle I guess Id ask why? are they not native to this world?  Did the worlds rotation only recently begin to slow down geologically speaking  so maybe theres some truly enormous moon spiraling in or recently captured thats putting on the brakes?  but well.  Thered certainly be a decoupling of darkness from time to sleep you sleep because youre tired not because its night.  In fact the default for most people might just be regular short naps instead of long slumbers.  In the real world waking up at am instead of am even if your brain is fully alert can be very inconvenient because its still pitch dark and everyones on a different schedule so you force yourself back to bed but here  everyones probably on different overlapping schedules anyway and its often pitch dark.  So you sleep when you need to and wake when you feel like and the rest of the world is no more out of sync than it would be to everyone else.Timekeeping in this world would be pretty important to come up with.  With our relatively short days and nights that neatly match up with our sleep cycles if the sky is clouded over and you cant see the sun or the stars youll still have a pretty good feel for when it is because youll have been awake since the last reference point.  These guys  theyll go to sleep wake up and not be sure how long its been picking up a little observational astronomy will be a basic skill for everyone but someones still going to want to come up with mechanical clocks even sooner than in our history.And until someone does come up with those clocks  and if youre in a medieval setting it may not feel right to have things like a town clock with bells and all existing  the nature of work  where you show up do labor for a while and then leave  could feel a little different.  Its easy to tell someone to be someplace at dawn at noon or dusk but there are going to be huge sections of each period of light thatll be hard to peg down.  Before clocks punctuality will be impossible.  Youll probably develop the tradition of expecting laborers including tenant farmers i.e. peasants to just get a certain amount of work done by Xday and really not expect them to necessarily be at any given place at any given time.Bedrooms may be less extravagant and important if most people are on a nap when I need to framework.  A wealthy man might simply have a comfortable place to snooze in his parlor or office and a separate dressing area rather than an ornate bedroom.Sex may also be decoupled from sleeping and beds generally  because couples sleep cycles wont happen to sync up and because sleeping is again something you do when tired rather then at given times of day.,worldbuilding,d42g24p,11,t5_2rd6n

7888798,0,t3_4nac65,The Nicodemian Song of Olde was once the faith that united the colonists of Sorrento. However communication across the Telemarine Empire made maintaining the religious organization difficult. Theres a massive sparsely inhabited plain separating the Old East where the Song was based and the Far West where colonists were moving enmasse.When the First Ancellestrian Revolutionary War split the Empire the Far West developed a far more mystical interpretation of the Song. It eventually began calling the religion The Anarchous Song and it was headed by the Radiant Maiden in Altarason. The Old East however used the Universal Song as a form of social control. Although they also reverse the Radiant Maiden the head of the Song in the Old East is the Painted Father who has little say in Ancellestrian religion.Both churches are still technically the same religion but the Radiant Maiden has issued edicts condemning Old Eastern interpretation of scripture in the past. One their end the Old Easterners regard the Anarchous Song as too apolitical too mystical and too willing to engage other religions.Oddly the Radiant Maiden has taken a greater involvement in politics in recent years. This is actually pissing off the Eastern leadership who fear that she may turn the Anarchous Song into her own personal transcendental cult.,worldbuilding,d42rvc6,1,t5_2rd6n

7920022,0,t3_4noo4f,I decided to make this post in the perspective of a human so for this I made up the Confederacy an alliance of humans and some aliens scattered over the local arms of the galaxy. This post is written in a dossier style and Im sorry its looooong because I wanted to roll  dice for each of the four civilizations on the planet. Seed dice for anyone interested Dossier on Orcan Authored by the ConfederacyThe planet Orcan is closer to its red star Karbatis than Earth resulting in a larger amount of radiation and the influence of its moon Arkun leads to massive tidal forces which creates volcanic conditions. Despite this some parts are not unlike Earth especially nearer to the poles. Its primary predator is the Madan an aggressive hunter with a long snakelike body and six legs. The predominant civilization is a race of fourlegged and two armed creatures covered in scale called Centaurs by Earthpeople although their preferred name is Elunoi and their physical frame only shares few features with humans such as a diurnal cycle and its arms having graspers similar to hands. Their heads are somewhat avian with a serrated beat for gnashing meat and fibrous plants alongside two eyes one for the visible spectrum and a second one for seeing in infrared.Although there are many cultures four primary civilizations exist. All of them have been gripped recently by the ArtDeco movement of the middle th century through our trade and it would not be surprising to find they have many objects encased in chrome and devices which seem to have come straight out of the s. All of these four civilizations share a common value of hard work and being industrious despite them having large differences otherwise.The first of the four peoples we shall cover is the austere mining civilization of Irdal. Sociologists have described its government as both corporate and marital and it philosophy on death and the afterlife has been compared to the Polynesians of Earth. They are a trade partner to us and promises of them joining the Confederacy are good if they can resolve territorial disputes with their neighbors.The second civilization the funloving Yagal are focused on entertainment. To them life is a game. They are run by oligarchic republics determined by whomever falls into one of their powerful great houses. They are believers in the cycle of reincarnation and although they are atheists they do worship the universe around them and are openminded to religious cultures. Their beliefs are based on the idea of heroism and their ideas are swept in an ideal of protagonism. Though their realms are safer than the rest they are of little economic use to us other than tourism.The third one is the sneaky civilization of the Galadar who deal in illegal goods. They are run by a socialist government with a strong dependence on powerful guilds most of them based on interstellar crime. Their beliefs in cyclical cosmology and animal gods alongside a past history of sacrifice has drawn comparisons with the Mesoamerican religions. Their fame however comes from their profane coming of age ritual called the culling wherein those who are  turns old fight each other over the course of several days until only half of the turn old population is still alive. Though barbaric they do this to please their gods. They are not to be trusted and travel through their territory is massively discouraged by the Confederacy.The final civilization is the austere Belhoi who are famous through the Arm for their thrifty attitude. They are expert bankers insurers brokers and  are known to value profit. Their civilizations tend toward republicanism and their cultures believe in a single creator Medol. The civilizations talks over disputed ore deposits with the Irdal have proven fruitful and we can now make alliances with both of them without risking conflict. They are also a valuable partner to Earth and should be protected at all costs from piracy.,worldbuilding,d46aa1k,1,t5_2rd6n

7930185,0,t3_4nw30j,I use the real world as a model all the time. I play a game called Europa Universalis  and the scale of it blows my mind. This game has opened my mind to just how big the world really is. I mean we all know that there are thousands of cultures and societies but until you break it down into something that our brain can comprehend you just cant grasp the scale of the real world. Take the Iberian peninsula for example there are at least three cultures Portuguese Spanish and Argonese in just that small area. I use this as inspiration. I break down the countries into their parts. Cultures trade goods economic impact of different regions population density of certain area climate impact government types and interaction with the populace and religion just to name a few. The game EU does all of this very well and I use the real world to model my MUCH smaller worlds. I want to define every aspect on a macro scale so that when I move to the micro scale I already know who is probable to live in a region what religion they are and what they would tolerate as an individual society. I build from the outside in I guess you could say. Define a country and then define its people. The other thing I use the real world for is governments. I make it a habit to read about the way monarchies constitutional republics oligarchic theocracies and merchant republics just to name a few interact and how they govern. I feel that if I can build a world that reflects the diversity of the real world it would feel more real. I believe that every nation does not have to have a monarch and its better if theyre not all kingdoms in the traditional fantasy setting. And then we throw in dragons and magical sea creatures that have boats built on their backs and we mess up the realism!,worldbuilding,d47fego,2,t5_2rd6n

To protect themselves and better interact with other races the UnVol inhabit and control suits of power armor that give them a more humanoid appearance. Through a process known as conglomeration two or more UnVol can merge into a single more intelligent being but risk losing any sense of personality as the conglomeration grows larger.Galthraax Enourmous somewhat reptillian creatures with gorillalike posture and six eyesthree on either side of their head.

Obviously most characters in books are not actually like us but we can still place ourselves in their roles in our minds.When youre reading a book imagine its going to be turned into a movie and theyre casting people for the roles.  Will you be able to be cast for the main character?  Or will you only be eligible to play a damsel in distress a doting mother a slave or an enemy savage?  Yes I can still enjoy a story about a white male warrior but I cannot see myself in that role.  And thats okay sometimes but for women and minorities this doesnt just occur sometimes  it occurs the majority of the time.Again the problem is not that one author does this.  Its that the majority of authors focus on white male protagonists.  It sucks when the only characters who look like you are the slaves.

Sonda and Hynna were husband and wife and for the longest time very happy. These beings lived in Nyrjun.gt After  years however Hynna got pregnant. Sonda did not yet feel ripe to become father and on the day of Gelias birth he ran away into Eorjun. gt The first day after Sonda left Hynna weeped uncontrollably. As a result stars were born. Day two Hynna breastfeed Gelia which meant that Gelia was soon to be a fully grown Goddess. After four and a half day Hynna went looking for Sonda thus creating the cycle of day and night. This also explains the five day weeks.Once a year Gelia falls ill which is when Hynna slows down to care for her daughter. This creates the shortening days when winter starts. The disease shows in leaves falling and temperatures dropping. Hynna notices when Gelia nearly dies which is midwinterday. A day more and Gelia might not have made it.Once Gelia gets better Hynna runs extra quickly after Sonda shortening the days aka distance between Hynna and Sonda up until the moment when Gelia falls ill again.,worldbuilding,d4ataco,1,t5_2rd6n

They are the Self or a representation of it in the world keeping it together within the Dream and upholding the dichotomy of OblivionMundus. Each built on their own joint of the worldbones they allow anyone who possesses Tower and Stone to wield terrible forces of creation. The World is a Wheel. When one achieves the Self and exits the Wheel they see the Wheel from the side where it is a Tower. The Tower is I and I is the Self. If you too see this and see this without fear you too are the Self and you know CHIM. As Vivec said The secret Tower within the Tower is the shape of the only name of God I.The chilling thing is that the last few games have all dealt directly with the dismantling of Towers. In Morrowind the Nerevarine destroyed the Heart of Lorkhan not only disabling the Second Numidium Akulakhan but also disabling the Red Mountain the Red Tower whose Stone was the Heart. Later the Red Mountain became unstable and exploded.In Oblivion Mehrunes Dagon is defeated but not after the Amulet of Kings is lost  and the gemstone within the Chimel Adabal was a droplet of blood of Lorkhan and the Stone of the Tower of the Ayleid the White Gold Tower.In Skyrim the Dragonborn defeats Alduin but also closes the Time Wound which is rumoured to be the Stone of the Snow Tower the Throat of the World.We know that the CrystallikeLaw the Tower on Summerset Isle was destroyed during the Oblivion Crisis though we dont know how. The Orichalc Tower of the Redguards has been destroyed long ago and took their continent with it.

Finally you have ocean current continents and mountains. All these determine weather patterns and thus climate. Ocean currents are often determined by the shape of tectonic plates and subsea terrain. They carry hot water and cold water around to the different continents. Continents and their size determine how much rain the wind carries and its strength on its course over the planet. While mountains can outright change certain weather systems creating what is known as the Rain Shadow effect. Lots of things that can be taken into consideration when deciding on climates.

8203404,0,t3_4rpd5a,Bioengineered diseases are always an option if your setting is advanced or a magical disease where you can handwave explanation if your setting is fantasical.Within the grounds of normal realistic diseases Im not quite so sure. Many symptoms of most diseases arent necessarily the virus or bacteria trying to kill its host on purpose or spread per say as a virus or bacteria never intentionally wants to kill its host as it wants to reproduce at all costs. A virus or bacteria reproducing is usually the cause of many symptoms.For example The enflamed lymph nodes of the Bubonic Plague black death are the result of the bacteria localising and then reproducing causing the body to react adversely.Because of this its hard to justify a disease that on purpose prevents itself from reproducing just for the sake of masking itself in hope that the host walks into other individuals. Our immune systems are remarkably strong and most viruses germs  and bacteria that are hostile to us are usually prevented entry or are immediately killed before symptoms are even onset. Reproducing is one of the diseases ways of trying to survive the attacks of the immune system and diseases reproducing usually brings the attention of the immune system to them causing symptoms like fevers swelling coughing and sneezing etc.An idea Maybe a disease that localises in the throat but reproduces very slowly and then throws itself into overdrive when it senses an increase in hormones such as during sex or kissing. It reproduces and then enters the saliva where an exchange of fluids allows it to split into the person the host is kissing. It continues to reproduce at a low rate until eventually its noticed by the immune system at which point the disease can panic and start symptoms that shut the throat and suffocate the host. Doesnt sound particularly lethal since all lovers and sexual partners could be quarantined as soon as the first individual dies but its an diea.You can call it the Lovers Kiss or something like that.,worldbuilding,d52z9vl,1,t5_2rd6n

8209396,0,t1_d53pqi1,gt By the first century the Romans had already dismantled the institution of the pharaonic court any attempt by the British to recreate it would seem blatantly artificial to the Egyptians. Itd be like if someone invaded China today and tried recreat the imperial court. If it worked for the Romans in real life for  years why wouldnt it work for the British in your fictional world?  Im referring to controlling the population not the pharonic court thing.I mean dont take this the wrong way but being as this is all a fictional world it feels like youre saying Ive created an arbitrary frustrating situation that I cant solve.Youve decided that the butterfly effect prevents everyone after  BC from being born including a particular major historical figure.  Shifting the timeframe forward about  years doesnt work because some arbitrary assumptions about the local politics of a region.  The Egyptians wouldnt be like Oh these British are fine and dandy.  No reason to rebel against them! just because the ruling dynasty technically exists. In fact theyd be more likely to respect the British if they freed them from their Roman conquerors who would have fully incorporated them as a province less than two or three generations prior!.You can say that the butterfly effect doesnt kick in and Jesus is still born. You can say that some Ptolemeics are still around postAugustus.  You can say that the Brits plop down a new dynasty and use their future technology and enormous wealth to convince the locals that its a true dynasty.   The British can bribe all the noble and military familiesgroups to support British rule.  The British can go tyrannical and keep the population in check with their future technology and enormous wealth.None of the problems you are having actually exist!  And hell theres actual historical precedence for kingdoms and ruling groups going away and reappearing across longer time periods than the  years between BC and AD to grab a postChrist year.  BabylonAkkadiaetc disappeared and reappeared.  LOADS of people claimed the throne of China under new dynasties.  Japan went through several dynasty shifts.  Even the line of Julius Caesar was broken several times in less than a few centuries IIRC.The locals are going to rebel at any foreign rule.  One of the primary reasons they were somewhat okay with Roman rule was that Egypt was doing pretty well and the Romans tended not to step on local customs.  In the end so long as theyre a not being mistreated b not having cherished customs stamped out and c feedclothedsheltered then theyll be fine with whoever sits in the big chair.  If you want the locals to not rebel at British rule then you can make them not rebel at British rule.Sorry if it comes across as a rant I just never understood people talking themselves out of their own fiction like this.edit I should say that in the end if the butterflyeffect thing is an integral part of the story that you like then disregard everything Ive said!

8211529,0,t3_4rpkj4,When someones shooting at you or you even think so everythings is extremely confusing and even with the best modern technology you dont really get that birds eye view of events you get in movies and video games. AT ALL.Troops and those leading the troops on the ground actually see very little of whats happening. Good luck trying to do all those fancyschmancy tactical maneuvers that are so easy to do in Total War series for example. Okay maybe it worked for Roman legions. To some extent. But only because theyd drilled basic combat techniques so much.Everythings also very sloooow and far more regimented than freeforall movie scenes would suggest. Forget action games too or play Steel Beasts.Particularly the first time you are in a hot situation and for most people because there are some exceptional folks who simply dont seem to be bothered trying to do just about anything is kind of like trying to do things with mittens on your hands. Mental tasks are like you had mittens around your brain. The effect diminishes with training and experience and seems to be one of the key differentiators between veterans and rookies.I think it was Thucydides who noted some time ago that in every military force there are few men who really do the damage and lead the force home a very large majority who tag along and support the action as long as the few psychopaths are doing the damage and a few who shouldnt be there at all. Seems to be just as true today. Unfortunately it is very hard to say in advance whos who. Sometimes those who boast the loudest are the best soldiers usually theyre not.Simplicity and speed the latter flowing from the former are generally the key to success. Almost every cunning plan will fail miserably. Look up what Clausewitz meant by friction if you want to know why.Nevertheless a successful commander should try to pressure the enemy from multiple dimensions not necessarily multiple directions simultaneously. Thats the key to understanding why combined arms techniques are so important the idea is to leave the enemy with bad options only. Enemy shouldnt be able to advance upon you because you have set up light weapons properly but if he tries to hide in a ditch then your mortars should be able to pound him and once his antitank weapons are suppressed your tanks should mercilessly crush him beneath their steel treads. But if the tanks get bogged up then your infantry should become the main effort or schwerpunkt and rout the enemy thats busy worrying itself with tanks.How this works with premodern armies Sun Tzu has it all covered. Heck theres been very little thats fundamentally new in strategic thinking since he wrote the book. When Sun Tzu wrote about CHENG and CHI the diversion and the main effort and how they should be able to switch roles instantly if needed he envisaged precisely how combined arms works. No doubt they worked for the ancients too there are some rules of armed conflict I believe have been valid for as long as man took arms against another.There are different schools of thought on how troops should be led and commanded. The U.S. Army for example tended my experience from observing how they operate and hearing debriefs from joint training to micromanage a lot. Plenty of radio chatter and detailed orders even before simplest maneuvers. Individual radio nets for platoons even and with voice radios instead of message terminals oh my! In contrast the German school of thought with its mission tactics oriented approach a keyword perhaps worth looking up emphasizes lowlevel initiative and speed of execution. The battlegroup commander usually doesnt issue any detailed plans he issues what we call commanders intent such asgtIn order to threaten the flank of this enemy mechanized brigade and permit further operations against it I want to crush the enemy on that ridge see them driven before me and hear the lamentations of their women. Some artistic license taken.Once the commanders intent is known the group commander may only signal Advance!  quite possibly without even using the radio at all  and the battlegroups elements begin to execute their combat techniques pretty much autonomously trying to do their best to carry out or support the commanders intent. Whether this is better or worse than the U.S. style depends. But statistics show it worked fairly nicely for the Wehrmacht all things considered.Mission tactics require some fairly simple combat techniques that are drilled to instinctive level. The rule of thumb for junior officers in my army is as followsgtWhen in doubt attack.gtWhen in doubt how to attack flank the enemy.gtWhen in doubt where to flank flank from the right.Which leads me to remind that radios are not a substitute for leadership. Leading men is pretty much like playing with a rope you can pull it easily behind you but good luck trying to push it anywhere.Reserves properly used are key to victory. They should be committed against enemys weakness reinforcing defeat is one of the top three cardinal sins a commander can possibly commit. Alas it is far too common nevertheless. Sunk cost fallacies and all that.In fact all force should be committed against enemys weaknesses and not his strengths. Once units are truly committed to a fight they can be incredibly difficult to pull out from contact. Attempts to do so before the enemy gives up the fight too all too often end up in tears. This works on many levels from individual combat to campaigns and wars.Artillery isnt for ambience only. Infantry may be the queen of battlefield but artillery and indirect fire in general is still THE king of battlefield and we know what kings tend to do to queens... In a modern fullscale fight and even without considering nuclear weapons it doesnt really matter all that much whats the caliber or make of personal weapons troops are toting around. Its nice if theyre lightweight and accurate but handguns do not win wars hardly even battles. Something I think many handgunobsessed folks dont seem to understand. Id rather take WW vintage bolt action rifles and plenty of artillery than the most modern superduper handguns money can buy but little artillery. As long as troops dont actually run out of ammunition or functional guns re the overriding importance of logistics already noted in this thread theyd manage. Even in the most recent war from where we have relevant statistics  Ukraine  artillery accounted for well over  of casualties anyway. But troops need to trust their equipment and many place inordinate trust in their popguns so its probably for the best that theyre modern enough. In this and many other oftentimes strange and not always intuitive ways morale is to equipment and numbers as to three is to one.Special forces are badly overrated just like handguns. Just like handguns they dont win wars hardly even battles skirmishes sometimes but if they have to skirmish somethings probably amiss. But just like handguns or any other tool in the commanders toolbox sometimes theyre nice to have around in case you cant call more artillery for some odd reason. Which leads me to...Welltrained force survives the loss of its commander. Badly trained force doesnt. But never send a man to do a job an artillery shell can do. Did I mention those who trained to oppose a mechanized enemy tend to like artillery a lot? And our forward observers too?EDIT Formatting.,worldbuilding,d53zva1,7,t5_2rd6n

8259065,0,t3_4sk7ok,Hehrikinaeah is the far western reaches of West Norosica. It is directly east of Centralia across the CentroNorosican Straits. It is a land that has been often called the Envy of Kings due to its perceived location near the center of the known world.  The knights of this land generally wear the singular chest plates that are common in West Norosica.  The ones with higher prestige or renown often wear muscled chest plates.  Hehrikinean knights often wield heavy twohanded weapons relying on their thick armor for protection.  The Centralian Dominion  is the remnants of the old Centralian Empire across the straits to the east.  The knights of this once imposing nation wear armor that is slightly less protective than that of their eastern counterparts.  The armor is most often segmented plate more common in the west.  If offers increased movement and a lighter weight but sacrifices some protection.  Because of this Dominion knights are sometimes seen wielding shields.  However brave men or foolish men will sometimes forgo a shield and wield a second weapon or a twohanded weapon.Both of these soldiers types are sometimes called feather tops or quill heads by those familiar with them.  Both Centralian and Hehrikenaean knights where plumes in their helms most often made of horse hair or textiles but sometimes actual feathers of varying colors that symbolize their allegiances.  The plumes can be replaced when a knight moves on to fight for a new faction or cause which is less expensive than purchasing a new tabard crested shield or cloak.  Knights from these regions rarely serve once cause for more than a few years so a knight will often change their plumes many times over their career. Knights in both of these nations have lost some of the prestige they have had in centuries past as militias and regular soldiers are more obtainable and affordable.  They are now often looked at as nothing more than more exoensive mercenaries.  However while the knights may have lost some significance and respect they are still an intimidating force on the battlefield.Feel free to ask me any questions about these soldiers or the lands from which they come!,worldbuilding,d59xv6p,2,t5_2rd6n

8270074,0,t3_4sp5lo,Shamblemen Twigmen Lurkers etc. Theyre humanoid twigconstructs that roam the deepest parts of the Forest. If they sense a soul nearby or a being capable of hosting a soul they go into a frenzy and hunt it down.   They feed on souls. Once theyve eaten one they begin to imitate its owner resulting in them having halfhuman halftwig faces or organs without skin or other kinds of mutations broken personalities and behavioral quirks.  They sometimes like to play house in the middle of the forest setting tables or sweeping the forest floor with makeshift brooms. Some even hunt and cook or try to or talk and laugh on their own.Sometimes a Shambleman will manage to eat a soul so cleanly that it will take the full appearance and personality of the person it ate and migrate back into society without anybody noticing. Over the years its facade will begin to crumble literally as the soul it ate decays. It then goes mad and becomes a danger to its surroundings.You can kill them quite easily by breaking their bodies. And you can resist them eating your soul by claiming it similarly to how Gods ascend.

Large loss of life in the weakest and largest country is the farthest youd get after studying magic for a while and theres mostly normal people there that are new to using magic. The others have far better structure and more condensed amounts of powerful people. With allies you could get pretty far depending on the time you decided to attack and the level they were at. Depending on their abilities and how wells yours and their magic synergizes you could get very very far. There are definitely people youd have to look out for but you wouldnt manage to do enough damage to my world anyways. Theres too many people out there capable of stopping you and have probably done the same exact things you did just in the opposite direction of protecting the world. And theres far too many of them. Of course there are special circumstances in which you would get father. However you will never kill everyone even under these circumstances. If you manage to piss off a certain person you dead. If a certain Devil gets summoned that just makes it even more difficult for you. There are plenty of ways to stop you.     TLDR Only under the best circumstances with allies in the same situation and many decades of training could you manage to cause a massive amount of damage. Even then you wont kill everybody.

Schools are popular for this purpose as are other academic locations. The stereotypical lure is to bring the mark in by offering a free personality test and then identifying their core weaknesses. The cult then offers to help the mark fix these problems usually in the form of free meetings. The meetings are usually free but literature and ritual materials tends to be very expensive. During this stage the mark will usually rationalize their membership Its just a selfhelp program!.Before long the mark is an active member of the cult. The cult can start influencing the person into modifying their personal relationships bringing in their close friends and cutting everyone else out of their life. Soon the mark is deeply embedded in the cult utterly dependent on them for socialization and networking purposes. Many cults will also provide jobs and housing for their members while others will provide means of advancement at their current jobs. At this point the mark fully believes in the cults mission Of course I dont talk to my parents anymore  They dont believe in what Im doing!!.Finally certain members will be initiated into greater mysteries. A key moment is the mystery play  An event or ritual that thrusts the cultist into a radically different world they cant understand without guidance.

The world has just moved on. However there is one church left.So back when the aforementioned Divine War occurred the Light Queen utilized humans as her trump card against the Shadow King. Selecting  humans each powerful in their own right she outfitted them with the capabilities to forge weapons in their own image using the Light Queens essence. Essentially these  Divine Heroes as they would be called forged their own weapons optimized to slay darkness. Helped along by the Light Queen the Divine Heroes rallied humanity and defeated the Shadow King. In the aftermath the Divine Heroes went their separate ways and fulfilled their own ambitions.Two of them one more so than the other are the important ones for this tale. One of the heroes went on to found a country becoming the first king of Soliade establishing the capital city of Sol on one side of a river. He would build his castle on its banks facing the water. The other heroine founded her own society on the other side of the river. She rallied a group of followers that were devoted to their savior the Light Queen. Her following was not as large as her contemporarys but she too erected a grand cathedral on the riverbank so that the castle in Sol and this cathedral of Albus City faced each other. Years passed and Sol ended up growing much much faster than Albus City. Eventually settlement spread across the riverbank encroaching on Albus Citys territory. Though the two societies had their solidarity Albus City desired to remain independent of the more powerful Sol and so the denizens of Albus City constructed a humongous wall around their settlement effectively isolating themselves from the people outside. Sol continued to expand and eventually grew to surround the walled city. A bridge connected Sol and Albus City across the riverbank between Sols castle and Albus Citys cathedral but it was considered ceremonial and it rarely saw any use. Albus City was locked away from the rest of the world as they continued to practice their faith in undisturbed silence.Nowadays Albus City is largely ignored as is religion as a whole by the general public but the giant wall that housed the equally giant cathedral within gained a reputation among the local population. Due to its intimidating stature and isolation Albus City is colloquially known as the White Citadel. The activity of the denizens within is for the most part completely unknown to the outside world. The church oversees the crowning of the reigning monarch of Soliade but like the very thing that connects them to the outside world is merely ceremonial. All that is known about their practices is that they still worship the Light Queen.In actuality the denizens of the White Citadel function as a secret society  practically a cult. Their matriarch the Divine Hero who founded them martyred herself in a bid for her compatriots to use her body in an attempt to harness her holy blood to recreate her magical healing powers she was granted by her Divine Weapon. Using her own knowledge when she was alive as well as her remains she left for them to use after she died the denizens of Albus City have conducted rituals for several generations that gifted those divine healing powers unto individuals. At first their efforts were successful but both the insight and the remains have decayed over the course of  years of trying to perfectly replicate the divine miracle and so their amount of healers has decreased and their power has weakened considerably. Its gotten to the point where healers are selectively bred and raised for the sole purpose of optimizing their bodies to be compatible with the power which leads to various problems in and of itself.The nature of the Divine Weapons is that they are everreincarnating. They were designed as a reflection of the very being of their creators but the Light Queen did not intend for them to be onetime use during the Divine War. In the nighinevitable case that the Shadow King would one day return the Divine Weapons were not lost forever when their original wielders all died off. The weapons themselves being an extension of their creators will themselves to be wielded by them and so each weapon is drawn to an individual of similar character to the original wielder. Similar to how the Avatar is chosen the very moment the wielder died it sought a replacement in a newborn infant who was most compatible with the soul of the original wielder. The weapon intangibly implants itself into the child and waits for them to eventually realize their potential and draw forth the power of the Divine Weapon. Essentially Divine Weapon wielders have a universal birthright to them. They cannot be wielded by anyone other than the designated wielder though not every wielder realizes their potential in which case the cycle still continues. Much like the Avatar again though not as communicable a wielder who has drawn their Divine Weapon is able to unconsciously tap into the essence of the original wielder effectively copying at least a fraction of their combat abilities as well as the enhancements granted by the individual Divine Weapon.AND SO since Elucia the Divine Weapon wielded by the founder of Albus City gave her magical healing powers which the church sought to emulate they wanted to make sure they could have their prime specimen as long as possible since they saw how their healing became less potent as the original wielders essence decayed over time. So whenever the church discovered a new wielder of Elucia the church sought to utilize her gender plays a role in compatibility as fuel to stoke the fires of their continued research. Many have been hunted down and martyred for the sake of using their bodies to tap into the secrets of divine healing with drastically varying levels of success all of which never hit the mark.So if you couldnt tell the church people are pretty crazy. Being isolated from the world for so long their society is dedicated to secrecy as they believe their holy rituals to be too pure for those who have long since forgotten their dedication to their savior the Light Queen. They even have a special unit that act as church assassins who go out and perform the aforementioned witch hunts so to speak as well as seek out and subdue any threats to the church and its secrets.Jesus that was long. Basically be wary of the White Citadel. But not too wary.,worldbuilding,d5kng3q,3,t5_2rd6n

He believes that God gave the Devil permission to try to destroy the faith of Gods people for  years and that the Devils primary weapon was electricity.My friend has devised mechanical ways of doing most of what we need to survive. He uses wind and water power built refrigeration using wind power and ground water and even has a saw that makes plank wood using water power.He grows his own food cuts his own wood makes his own clothes and even makes small manufactured goods like fish hooks paper detergent and hardware.It took him about  years to learn how to do all these things.

If someone is a very destructive mass murderer their soul becomes align with Darkness Destruction Death etc. If so aligned when they die their soul will go to the Abyssal Spiritual plane which isnt really designed to be bad.The Spiritual planes are mutable and your own thoughts and desires shape them. Unfortunately those aligned with destruction often create their own hell there but that isnt the worst place to end up. Because until a soul reaches maturity and takes its place among the divine it is stuck on the cycle of life death and rebirth. So you end up reborn on the Abyysal Physical plane.Those are hell worlds ruled by despots and warlord and willed demonic beings of all sorts.

8407683,0,t3_4usmvc,Among the Order of Deylki Knights also known as the Knights o Nine there is a tradition of naming ones sword shortly after being knighted and usually in honor of the person who knighted you. Because of this there are thousands of swords out there with names like Sir Jakos Sir Jonos Sir Tonos Sir Jenes Queen Settes etc. Somewhat more creative spins on that include names like Swordmaster Knighter Annointer Teacher Squired etc. Some knights are lazy and give their swords descriptive names like LongSword GreatSword Cutter Slicer Killer etc. However many knights will give much thought to the name of their sword and a particularly good name is usually seen as a sign of devotion to the Knights o Nine.Other types of weapons dont have such a culture of being named even among different nations. However it is not unusual for one to name their weapon and among major political figures generals and warriors it is the norm.Here are some examplesHockrott the Hornmans wields Red Hot Steel a halberd which triggers intense emotions in those around it. These emotions are meant to reach a zenith wherein the future wielder is full of only raw animalistic instincts. When Rott reached this point he was angry because his wings had been nearly burnt away his left horn had shattered and he had been badly shocked by lightning. He was so angry that he saw red was badly burnt and hot and he was looking for steel so he could pay back whoever did this to him. He took up the halberd. Red Rainish Runes magickaly inscribed these words along the axes cheek. Before this Red Hot Steel had belonged to KingthatKillsKings Ristt Blot who himself had stolen it from the Crahish branch of House Messoloriha the ruling house of Crahia up to thirty years ago. The branch of House Messoloriha had it since the times of Queen Sulenn I Messoloriha and Emperor Messink Messon before that who himself acquired it from the Slayers Guild. The Slayers Guild found it in a lagoon before then.Landeles the GodFromtheLightning wields Fate a set of chains imbued with lightning. He straightens it out wielding it as a spear cracks it wielding it as a whip or raises it wielding it as a wand through which he arcs lightning bolts. Landeles shortened its name from the Chains of Fate to Fate. He acquired it after the death of his mortal friend Gohr. Landeles was under the impression that Gohr had been a slave but in reality he had been a slave master. Gohrs people believed that slavery was the ultimate fate of evil people. Gohr disagreed with this and in an epiphany began his Crusade Against Fate by freeing tens of thousands of slaves and then continued on to live an extraordinary life. The chains belonged to an exslave who kept them as a reminder of his previous life. That exslave eventually died when he was transported to another world alongside Gohr. Fate deemed this death necessary as it birthed a line from which sprung one of the most important humans in world history Billow the Slave who freed tens of millions from slavery and founded his own nation. Billow interestingly was once a wielder of Red Hot Steel he tossed it in a lagoon after using it to kill its previous wielder Erz Black. Landeles means to fight against his fate which is to never die and lose all his loved ones to cursed immortality. For a long time he fought alongside Gohr for freedom from that other Earth.Lila the Nameless Woman wields String a Mykyn Zahal a curved long dagger which serves as the equivalent to Red Hot Steel on that Earth essentially following the warrior most beloved by the nameless gods. Lila is the least selfish human in existence and this is evident in the Mykyn Zahals name. String an old homeless cat with a stringlike whisker led Lila to the Mykyn Zahal. String was not a normal cat but rather the nameless god who embodied Lilas home the citysized castle of Bottomjaw. She was testing Lila presenting her with the weapon seeing what she would do when faced with a fearsome foe. Lilas pure animalistic instinct was to protect her only friend. In Myklasi Marks the name String was inscribed on the blade. Before that String had been buried beneath Bottomjaw. Its last wielder had been Myklas a mortal GoddesintheFlames who did battle against Landeles and lost her life for it.The GreatKnight Madame Duchess Midcloud Vayess of the House of Halfsmith wields Halfwolf a seasteel blade. Seasteel blades are made from a finite amount of special ores uncovered by Billow the Slave when he and his men were constructing the manmade Billows Sea. Most of it was used to make the Lycaonthrone a wolfheadshaped throne draped in chains. But thirteen blades were made and are reserved for the thirteen GreatKnights who serve and protect the Lycaonthrone directly. Vayess is the daughter of a traitor and for most of her life had no claim to her ancestral duchy of Midcloud. When she was but eight she professed to a sugar priest that she had unnatural urges to kiss other girls. The sugar priest was a zealot however and had her forehead carved with a V not the letter a symbol which denotes a sinner in the Faith of the Nine allowing all to see just how evil she was. Vayess had dreams of becoming a GreatKnight of being knighted by the GreatestKnight Ross Fourthwalk himself and of wedding the Princess Sulenn and showering her with gifts. Although tainted she was still a noble. She demanded to be trained to be a knight. They warned her that the obstacles were insurmountable. Vayess was a girl a noble lady at that a hornman a lesbian and the daughter of a traitor only a miracle could make her dreams come true. But ultimately a series of swordmasters reluctantly taught her how to wield a sword. One day the Princess Sulenn who loved animals followed a small dog through the alleys and hallways of Billows Tower happening upon Vayess sparring with the Knight of Mayonnaise an old man whom they both saw as a grandfatherly figure. The dog loved to watch Vayess sparring. Sulenn did too and would watch from afar for many months until her mother died and she became Queen of the Delkish Empire. She with all the power of a monarch became friends with Vayess. Vayess first gift to Sulenn was that dog. In return Sulenn arranged for the Wolf of Lobtonne Ross Fourthwalk to knight Vayess Halfsmith and for her claim to Midcloud to be given back. Vayess named Halfwolf after Ross. Lobtonne the capital city gets its name inuniverse from the Yockish word for half Lobott the name Halfsmith has the word half in it by distant relation Ross is half a Halfsmith and rumors suggest he is half an immortal werewolf. Ross is also known as the Wolf of Lobtonne. Vayess also named it a bit after the dog who she reasons is half a wolf. Lobtonne in reality gets its name from the Spanish word for wolf lobo.,worldbuilding,d5si7s7,1,t5_2rd6n

8418978,0,t3_4uvrry,In short form Ive tended to use mortals to refer to both the mundane and supernatural creatures because well they can all die. Yes fey jinn horrors and reapers cant die because of old age in most cases but if you injure them enough they can still be slain and pass on into the Underworld. Of course that nuance is often lost and therefor Ive started using the term besouled making the distinction between the creatures with soulsaka the sentient creaturesand then common animals and beasts. I do also use mundies or sleepers to refer to normal humans and supes to refer to anything with supernatural or magical abilitiesbe they a human wizard or mad scientist an angel or a dragon. Humans who are aware of the supernatural but dont have any powers are referred to as the awake or wakers and are functionally treated as supes... much to their detriment. ,worldbuilding,d5twyms,1,t5_2rd6n

8425427,0,t1_d5tq08j,Sorry crazy night.So in the near future a virus conquers most of the planet turning most people into ravenous mutants. Particularly in the US virus has taken everyone West of the Rocky mountains East of the Appalachians and in southern Canada. In the wake of this disaster a totalitarian theocracy unites Mexico and most flyover states under the Lord in the South a supposed second coming that is quite... conservative lets say. The Lord in the South is very against federal intervention so his armies are made from a series of independent groups.Repentants If you are found guilty of heresy the only way to purify your soul and keep your family safe from the Klan is to fight and die against the ever spreading virus. Once you enlist your family and friends attend your funeral as though you had died prior to whatever transgression you made against the Lord. Once you become a Repentant you are given a black trenchcoat a gasmask black boots and gloves and a GraveDigger which is a weapon made from a reforged WW era entrenchment tool. A Repentant rarely gets a gun due to the situation with the Gunsmiths.Gunsmiths Most industrial groups that were not faithful enough to the Lord in the South were destroyed as well as the knowledge carried with them. Couple this with how the Faith is very against innovation they believe putting faith in science is what caused the plague and youve got a recipe for stagnation. The Lord is also very pro Second Amendment rights so people who had the engineering knowhow to make their own guns made quite a bit of money in the new regime. These guns are crude prohibitively expensive and not built to last. Gunsmiths have a practical monopoly on firearms and are paranoid that a competitor might steal their unique designs so when they want to test out a new gun or just prove themselves faithful they send some of their best shots to the front.Brewers Without ready access to oil a new fuel source was needed for vehicles. Farmers and Moonshiners have existed since before the new regime and had the perfect opportunity to propose methane as an alternative. Between alcohol and fuel these farmers became some of the wealthiest men postinfection. These industries they monopolize are the lifeblood of the New America yet they too fear scrutiny from the Klan. So they feed the armies and transport them.Mechanics Someone had to convert all of those cars to methane! The same people who now convert cars to war machines against the plague! While typically they send one of their own to drive the precious vehicle its not unheard of for them to send just vehicle and hope someone on the front knows how to drive it.Klansmen The Klu Klux Klan still existed when The Lord in the South rose to power in Dallas and they were some of his supporters. He did not exalt them but he did not condemn them either. Once Mexico became a part of his territory the Klan was outraged. So he preached to them and turned these violent hateful men into a peacekeeping force to root out the heretics among them the undercurrent of  racism is still kinda there. The Klan now roots out heretics infected homosexuals and scientists hiding within New America. They also send some of their strongest men to the front lines to face the worst heresy there is the infection. Typically they use flamebased weapons to so mimic the fires of hell.

Perhaps there are neutral zones where soldiers from all sides can mingle freely with the implicit requirement that they leave factional conflicts at the door. Soldiers happily buying drinks for their enemies knowing that by tomorrow theyll be back to gunning each other down getting resurrected and doing the whole thing over again forever since no side can fully defeat any of the others.Perhaps since theres no such thing as casualties on Auraxis war would be treated less like the horrifying occurrence that it is in real life and more like a sport where soldiers on either side count kills and have running betting pools on how Jim is going to snuff it this time around.Itd be an interesting scenario for a soldier to shake hands with the enemy sniper who blew his head off just an hour ago and congratulate him on his marksmanship.,worldbuilding,d5w9mvh,2,t5_2rd6n

Exceptional miners and blacksmiths experts on metals minerals and gemstones. Dweorg are strong built muscular with wide shoulders short legs fiery eyes and usually long reddish brown or black hair. However even though they are underground creatures there are several forts built by dweorg usually high on the mountains and hard to reach by foot. These forts are owned by different clans and mostly serve as workshops smiths and homes connected with the underground mines and catacombs. Most well known clans are Silvur Silver Dweorg Glowan Gold Dweorg and Kamyn Stone Dweorg. They are intelligent and extremely crafty their mines and forts are often protected with puzzles and traps as well with complex labyrinths. Recently some of the dweorg left their underground homes and live in human cities usually working as blacksmiths or merchants.Their enchanting skills are also very high. Dweorg enchanted items such as weapons armour jewelry and so on are considered to be of highest quality.  Although religious Dweorg do not have a traditional form of religion with priesthood. Instead they express religiosity through their craftsmanship and richly decorated altars.Each clan is ruled by a king. However Dweorg kings dont have absolute power and often take council with other leaders.KobelingsKobs Lair is a home of kobelings known also as goblyns goblins or gobelins. Although kobelings can be found in almost every part of Rygelstyr Kobs Lair is considered their kingdom comprising of several tribal fortifications nested deep in the forests and huge network of caves and catacombs. Humans rarely travel through this area trying to avoid any danger of encountering these creatures known to attack anyone on sight. For this reason exact size and population number of Kobs Lair isnt known.Kobelings are generally small earthly green skinned humanoid creatures living rather primitive and simple.  Some breeds can achieve a slightly bigger almost human size. Their intelligence is somewhere between that of a human and animal although there are examples of a rather intelligent kobeling capable of even assimilating into human societies.Kobelings live by hunting and plundering unaware travelers. They either dont know about farming or arent interested in it. Their  villages can be found in most isolated parts of Rygelstyr usually deep in the forests and close to rivers or lakes made of simple skin huts. Kobeling weapons are primitive  simple hunting bows and wooden spears. However they are known to loot any piece of equipment be it weapon or armour and use it in their own way. Thus its not unusual to find a group of kobelings with swords shields or improvised armours made of material found elsewhere.Each tribe is led by a chieftain who is usually either strongest and biggest in the group or have some other special talent like higher intelligence or talent for magic. Its common for every tribe to have a shaman or a witch. They are kobelings gifted with average talent for magic working and who also serve as priests. Kobelings worship Kob an archaic chthonic deity of curses fertility death fire and stones. He is often represented as a kobeling with large spear menacing grin and big eyes. Kobelings often draw him in caves or even make simple raw stone statues of him. Some art collectors highly value this statues not for its artistic value but for its exotic character and danger involved in acquiring them. Some statues have traces of dried blood on them making them even more expensive. It is believed that kobelings sacrifice animals to Kob spraying the blood over statues. In rare cases they sacrifice captured humans who are then eaten. Its a widely known fact that kobelings eat humans.Some nobles and researchers of Visantos used to hire mercenaries to capture young kobelings for scientific research or to keep them as petsslaves. Tradition of owning kobeling slaves is widely spread even today in noble houses of Visantos.,worldbuilding,d5xg7cl,6,t5_2rd6n

8484584,0,t3_4vuim9,In Sage Realm it varies from region to region.In most regions harpies arent very popular. In the past many harpy populations would follow armies and scavenge the bodies of dead soldiers. Because of this many cultures grew to view harpies as an omen of death. Rayvals as a carnivorous species are more empathetic to harpies so they get along pretty well.The biggest widescale racial conflict is found in Urndland. Urndland is a wealthy elf nation with an economy that is heavily dependent on slavery. Its the only nation where slavery is illegal and the issue is causing tense relations with other countries. In Urndland all nonelves have fewer rights than elves and nonelves who enter the country run the risk of being taken into slavery. However there are plenty of elf slaves as well usually criminals and certain ethnic or cultural groups. majority of Urndland slave population consists of elves humans and centaurs People in other nations tend to be very distrustful of wealthy Urndland elves.Centaurs dont often partake in as much direct interaction with other groups. Their large horselike bodies make it difficult to travel and stay in places designed for more humanoid populations though some of the larger more diverse cities are taking steps to be more centaurfriendly. Most centaurs who do travel do so for work as they can get paid quite handsomely for manual labor. Even moreso than the general population they are distrustful of Urndland elves as centaurs are heavily targeted for the slave trade.,worldbuilding,d624aht,1,t5_2rd6n
8485060,0,t1_d625i4s,Thank you very much!Scholars Row is kinda neat though. As the center of Omura it has a lot of history as battling grounds for opposing Metrans and Middleneres. It wasnt until the Ardelinian conquest and subsequent formation of Omura that Scholarss Row really developed into a society with zoning laws and culture.It also borders southern Wildenor a dense forest filled with dangerous creatures. Traveling even further north leads to the nation of Accrostura with whom Omura feuds constantly. So Scholars Row is in this unique position of being the literal and figurative center of Omuran society and advancement yet is also resting on some pretty hazardous land. As a resident of Scholars Row youre definitely more knowledgeable than about  of the rest of Omura growing up surrounded by countless educational resources. However theres always some outliers who dont buy into the system of being raised in such a sheltered environment.

Namely one with little to know prospects or profitable skills but if you need something done that even a complete idiot could do theyd be it. More than likely theyll be willing to take small quantities of drugs as payment.While its a modern word that sort of person is rather universal throughout humanities history. Now and days the assassins you hire from the darkweb or off the streets are bum fucking idiots who are far to irresponsible for legitimate work. In the seventeen or eighteen hundreds that hatchetman will most likely be the town drunk or escaped con.

8536665,0,t1_d685ocm,Okay nice. Currently theres nothing for beaks or other facial features in the system except for eyes and hornstusks. Id like to have something separate for them especially since horns for example very rarely seem to occur in predators and there could be differing numbers of them in different places rhinos!.Im having trouble understanding what torsional symmetry means since google doesnt help me here.Eye placement should also depend on the diet since predators most often have front placed eyes. Currently Im manually correcting this for each creature. A system for other senses and their sophistication would be interesting for determining the primary sense of the creature. Also the number of colors they can discern to find the mantis shrimps out there. Some rare weird senses could be added for example bioradio communication etc.I like the idea of culture tables but that could become so big that its best to put in its own document. Some features of cultures are relevant to most animals though. There could be something for tool use as even some very simple animals do that on Earth. Theres for example crows with distinct material cultures and advanced manufacturing in the form of tools made for making of tools.Many types of animals have communication systems and use different mediums for it. Some territorial animals use chemical messages to mark their territory while others make noise and sepias have their shining lights to talk about their feelings. Also the whales could talk accross the Pacific before noisy humans came along. This should mainly depend on the senses the creature has.Something more accurate of the mating behavior could be interesting like is it the annual huge lek or biannual heat or the constant chaos like us.Lifespan could be a nice addition which Ive been using a lot in my previous concreatures. I think its mainly dependent on size but then theres parrots and tortoises so maybe not too heavily dependent.It would be nice to have a system for limb use. Currently Im throwing dice randomly for that or dictating when ridiculousness happens. Mainly Im meaning when the creature has more than one pair of limbs how many of them are used for walking. Ive got some six legged walkers some centauroids two and four armed bipedals and many quadrupedals. Some choices are pretty straightforward like wigsamplegs but this could make some interesting designs.This is currently the best system for this Ive come accross and Im very glad its becoming even better.,worldbuilding,d68negg,2,t5_2rd6n

Even if a kind master decided that he wanted his slave to be free he would be in constant danger of just being recaptured by another person.In classical times the slaver and the salved often shared the same origin and a slave released by his master would be considered the same as a freeman.In Latin America you had sort of a middle point.

Pick one or two to focus on and take them to extreme conclusions. You can do this at a cosmic scale that applies to your entire setting or apply individual tropes to different cultures and turn them up to . Mixing and matching common fantasy tropes in different ways can go a long way too. For example I decided to make dwarves the premier mages of my world. How did they get that way? The settings source of magic is a massive mountain range to which the dwarves were given exclusive mining rights. Over generations their proximity to the stone instilled the dwarves with magical potential that outpaced the other races. Subverting one trope dwarves are poor mages and explaining it by exploiting another dwarves are great miners gave me a culture that has a different feel than your typical dwarves.edit Added second paragraph,worldbuilding,d6js936,2,t5_2rd6n

Of the three main deities of the old setting one remains while another was merged with a lesser deity. Of the old main characters only the least Mary Sue one has made it into the new setting and now gets his mind warped in exchange for the power he gains.

8699370,0,t3_4z44od,Solum  Also referred to as Solar Gold. A YellowGold metal that emits the light and warmth of the suns glow. It is warm to the touch and simply being in close proximity to the material has been noted to have a mood elevating effect. In holy scripture Solum is said to originate from the sun itself though scholars squabble tirelessly over whether this is meant to be taken literally. Religious texts use a single name to refer to both the astral body of the sun and its patron deity. Under different readings it could be understood as a piece of the sun itself a gift from the Gods or perhaps a fragment of their own Divine essence.The metal can be shaped and worked into armor and weapons but for one exception it cannot be made to hold an edge. It may be for this reason that the Church favors primarily blunt weaponry such as maces clubs and hammers. It also serves as a prodigious channel for divine energy and can be used as a focus for holy miracles.Astrum  Commonly referred to as Starglass or Stardust depending on the materials form. It is a translucent material ranging in color from a pale white of frosted glass to a striking luminescent blue. It crystallizes in areas where magical energy is particularly dense coating every surface in a frostlike covering. This loose form of Astrum known as Stardust is incredibly harmful to most biological life. When inhaled it can cause mania racing thoughts often thought to be cosmic insight beyond the victims comprehension anxiety sleep deprivation and hallucinations. If the victim particularly magic sensitive or if the background arcane energy is sufficiently charged these hallucinations may begin to manifest physically to the detriment of all present in the area. To some these effects are considered desirable and in certain places Stardust is consumed as a street drug.Starglass is the more solid substantial form of Astrum. Manifesting in jagged irregular multifaceted crystalline growths. It is often found naturally as the result of a Starfall an event in which one or many shards of Astrum fall from the heavens and collide with the worlds surface. The shards that survive the impact are of great significance and value to the worlds arcanists. They can hold a magical charge to be called upon at a later time or to passively provide power to an ongoing spell or enchantment. The opposite is also true Astrum that has been depleted of its magical energy will readily absorb it from its surroundings. Mage hunters will often carry with them specialized daggers made of depleted Astrum to draw the energy from their foes before it can be used against them in combat.As a natural result of magic use a mage will continuously accumulate Astrum within their body. The body will develop a tolerance to the substance to an extent and it also serves to bolster the Mages supply of available magic to channel. Inevitably however excessive magic use will eventually result in a condition known as Mageblight. Mageblight occurs when cluster of Astrum manifest as one or many tumerous crystalline growths upon the casters body. These growths cause immense pain symptoms similar to Stardust exposure an impediment of the users mobility or bodily function and eventually result in death.A similar but more benign condition has been seen to occur with Solum. Known as Blessed Bones a clerics skeleton may progressively become gilded with Solum after many years of channeling considerable quantities of divine power. These clerics are said to be closest to the gods themselves and seem to be granted a permanent state of enlightenment and bliss. Their bones bonded with the metal become nearly impervious to breaking rendering them formidable foes in combat. The added density to their bodies however is something more of a curse than a blessing. Many a tale is told of the unfortunate cleric who leapt from their ship to swim in the sea and sank like a stone never to be seen again.A third material known as Lunum guess what its associated with is present in my setting and ties to primal and druidic powers but I havent fleshed it out enough to include a proper write up for it.,worldbuilding,d6t1x75,2,t5_2rd6n

Even in a society where institutional sexism doesnt exist inevitably there are going to be men who think less of women and vice versa even if they only make up a tiny minority. Magic powers dont necessarily level the playing field either in fact if neither sex is better than the other at using magic then that still gives men a physical advantage over women  meaning they can still overpowerdominate them.

A private sector is a perfect way to do this because it doesnt cost the nation anything AND it performs a lot of functions that the government would usually do at no cost to the government. For example public transport is usually something that the government handles but it could easily be supported entirely by private companies that would usually offer better services at better prices. Apply this to literally anything you possibly can and you have a very efficient economy without enslaving your people. There are a few things that cant lean on this system like your military unless you go to fairly extreme lengths to do so like what I did for one of my nations but thats what taxes are for.

8803934,0,t3_50pqkd,First decide how many pantheons you want. At this time also decide if there are any false deities which may or may not include entire pantheons. These may include true pantheons that long ago died archfiends that have deceived people into believing they are deities fey that are mistaken as deities or delusional fabrications that never actually existed. Next decide how many notable deities exist in each pantheon. Note that often a pantheon will have more than this number of deities. For example the Greek pantheon had  primary deities but through the ages who was a member shifted a bit but around  total deities. ampnbspNow for each pantheon real and otherwise decide what each deity in that pantheon handles. Note that there can be overlaps. For example Athena and Ares were both deities of war albeit of different Greek citystates. The differences between how the two deities represented war was a reflection of the differing ethos regarding war between the two citystates. Perhaps some of these overlaps have always existed or perhaps a deity of one thing was coopted to also be the deity of another matter when a people they favored needed a deity to assist them in that field but none of their current deities handled that type of task. Note that the most common activities of a people will likely determine what fields are considered major. A people that live in a forest with few streams will not see a fishing deity as major while another people who live on the coast of the sea will likely accord much reverence to a god of fishing. A while ago I created a list of what areas were most often assigned to a deity based upon checking a few dozen pantheons at wikipedia which Ive placed here ampnbspDecide how the deities of a pantheon interact with each other. Are they all interrelated members of a single family often the case but not always? In that case perhaps the head of the pantheon is also the head of the family. Families do not always get along are there rivalries enduring arguments and so forth among the deities of the pantheon? Is there even a head of the pantheon? Perhaps a council instead guides their decisions. Perhaps the pantheon itself is a fusion of two or more pantheons as with the Norse pantheon  a fusion of the Aesir warriors and the more fertilityoriented Vanir. This can also create overlaps at least for a time. ampnbspWhat are the origin of the deities? Are they ascended humans incarnations of natural forces  elements powerful fey celestials born spontaneously from the collective worship of multitudes? Decide both upon the actual origin and what most worshippers believe to be their origin. Have they remained the same over time? Mine were originally a variant of fey a sort of elemental hybrid of fey and celestial but over time they have developed into entities that no longer have much resemblance to either fey or celestials. ampnbspWhat are the origin of celestials and fiends? Are they creations of the deities natural  spontaneous generations of some element or from worship entities that have invaded from another realm of existence? Do the celestials follow the deities or war with them? Do some follow some deities others follow others with the result that some celestials may at times war against each other? Are fiends fallen celestials a separate purposeful creation of one or more deities perhaps as instruments of war over which they later lost control alien invaders elementals of corruption incarnations of specific types of sin? Do they hate the deities andor celestials or merely find them incomprehensible? Do they corrupt  kill mortals to fuel their own power to weaken deities if deities are empowered by worship or just for amusement  like a cat playing with a mouse? Or is there a difference between fiends and celestials? Maybe they are the same just following different deities such that members of one religion view them as celestials and members of another view them as fiends.ampnbspDoes the divine realm exist in or out of the world? Is it a specific place in the world eg Mount Olympus that mortals could find and visit or is it in a different reality that might  or might not  be visitable perhaps with magic perhaps only with divine aid. Is it the same realm as the afterlife  or afterlives if you have more than one? Or is the afterlife yet another realm which may or may not have a deity living in it. Perhaps the deity lives with his or her peers and only occasionally travels to the afterlife much like a mortal travelling from his home to his job each day. ampnbspIf there is more than one afterlife location are they in the same realm or different realms of existence and how are they divided morally ie do good go there do bad go there by type of death in combat go here by disease go there by old age go over there etc by deity follow this guy go here follow that guy go there some combination of these or some other system entirely. Do the deities even have any influence over the afterlife? Perhaps all souls go to a common afterlife and the deities  due to their nature  are unable to enter that place perhaps are not even aware of what that place is only that it exists. Or perhaps most deities are like that but a rare few can go there  and may or may not have told the others truthfully about its nature. For example maybe your deities are powerful fey but as fey they are embodiments of the natural world  of the living. Just as a dryad cannot move too far from its tree so too can all or at least most of the fey not leave the living world for the spiritual world even if they might know it exists. ampnbspOr does no afterlife place exist? Perhaps upon death the soul joins its deity much like a rain drop joins an ocean. In this manner perhaps the deity is slightly  but permanently  empowered. The soul may or may not retain its selfawareness or perhaps initially it does but eventually this fades away. Perhaps it is slowly overwhelmed by the mind  nature  presence of its deity perhaps instead it merely finds its new existence monotonous eventually falling into a sleep from which it never awakens. Or perhaps upon death the soul continues as a ghost until it fades out of existence. ampnbspFinally do the deities care about receiving worship? Does it empower them and if so to what degree? As I have already suggested above I have deities receive power from their own nature from the souls of those that died while devoted to them and from the worship of the living. The first two are permanent sources of power  the second of which is ever growing while the latter is a more intense but transient form of power. Younger deities get most of their power from their worship but elder deities that have been worshiped for millennia have enough power from the souls of deceased worshippers that even if not worshipped they can do exceptional things. Those that die without ties to a deity become ghosts that tend to fade out of existence within years while those that are tied with a deity will continue to exist for centuries before eventually fading into the deity in the process empowering the deity to better aid their descendants. Rare souls may even be elevated into proxies of the deity  effectively minor deities in their own right becoming separate and immortal in the process. ,worldbuilding,d7643j8,1,t5_2rd6n

8857023,0,t3_51cfh8,Despite my settings being mostly about magical or futuristic stuff I have a couple of weapons that are practical enough. The first being the gunlance used by the Sekt. This gunlance isnt massively sized or bulky in fact its just a big metal rod with blades attached. The rounds chamber internally much like an oldfashioned rifle or revolver and are often just simplistic musketballs fired with black powder its nothing really fancy. The gun part is used on unarmored targets or targets with weak armor whereas the blade and lance parts are much more commonly used in close quarters. The weapon itself isnt really all that scary its more to do with how they are wielded by giant anthropomorphic wasps who could crush a human skull with their bare hands fairly easily that tends to scare others. The second being the Lisikian ATG or AntiTitan Gun as it is often called. This borders between being a light machine gun or assault rifle due to its massiveness and sheer clip size. Its recoil is extremely difficult to control due to the size and weight of the ammunition but then this is where the nickname Giantkiller or AntiTitan Gun comes in. Its rounds are armorpiercing by default as the Lisikians do love their AP rounds. Its firepower and weight make it seem like a mounted weapon turned infantry weapon and it is usually more useful as a turret emplacement. It shares the Lisikian idea of power trumping all else and its use reinforces their seemingly stupidly daring mindset. ,worldbuilding,d7chm8a,1,t5_2rd6n

Linen made from flax has been used for woven cloth for perhaps as long k years Cotton by comparison has only been used for about k years ampnbspIf you want to be more original and you are only allowing Euarchontoglires ie rodents to primates then why not Capybaras that have been bred over a few thousand years to have longer hair and stay out of water? The hair can then be harvested and used much like yak or llama hair chosen for examples as both tend to have straight hairs. Much like yaks they can also be used as a source of meat perhaps becoming a standin  replacement for pigs and sheep. ampnbspYaks are also a source of milk. Until the late middle ages sheep were a more common source of milk than cattle at least in Europe not sure about India. Given a few thousand years of domestication capybara should be capable of evolving to produce useful amounts of milk each day. It only took few hundred years to change cattle from barely  gln  year to  gln  year and a few hundred more to up that to k gln  year but then cattle already had some useful traits for dairy domestication so it should take longer for capybara. Presume at least a thousand years I guess? Also cattle didnt really replace sheep until cattle were themselves partially replaced as beasts of burden by horses. ampnbspFeathers in modern times are rather complex branched hollow hairs. You cant really weave clothing from such. But early in their evolution they were merely hollow hairs. Perhaps you can have some flightless birds more like late period dinos with such hair that can be harvested. I wonder if their hollowness will make clothing made from such to be more insulating?,worldbuilding,d7djfri,3,t5_2rd6n

It took a while for a new sound to emerge in the form of Zess.Early Folk Songs Early Zess Swing Zess Jolt and Shock   . Music around this time period developed a more guitar heavy vocal driven sound to it.Early Jolt Jolt Hard Jolt Shock Synth Shock Must and Phono   . Around the same time as Jolt was coming into its own another branch of music acquired a more Musty sound to it and quickly formed into more danceable music than Jolt or Shock.Early Must Must Early Phono Phono Synth obsession   . With synthesizers and samplers being invented around  a new sound started emerging from Shock and Phono and some older genres as well.Synth Synthzess Phonosynth Aetherzess Zess comes from Zest which is a variation of the word that supposedly inspired the word jazz Jesm.

8909116,0,t3_529kq6,Vo at least the explored regions covers an area roughly the size of South America. In the north there is the tundra and taiga lands of the Silvs. Then comes the forested fjords and hilly lands of the Ingdal and the steppes of the Duin. South and east of the steppes along the coast are the moors of the Goedyn.Nearly cutting the continent in half is a large gulf that helps feed an area known as Bagnan Swamp a large swamprain forest that reaches far inland that is home to an offshoot of the Naharajal. It is also the last holdout of the Fioreg and the Wanfereg. The farther one ventures into Bagnan Swamp the less light they are likely to see until they reach a point where all life has evolved in a sense to either be part of the darkness or shed some faint light.West and south of Bagnan Swamp stretching from the mountains to the sea is the grasslands of MiErte. MiErte is home to a vast number of tribes that make up the Kynthyr people. Along with the strange flora and fauna such as grass pods that can spontaneously combust and ratsized lizards that live in hivelike mounds MiErte becomes the  Not in Kansas anymore  moment for northerners.Further south the land becomes more arid. Southeast of MiErte there is a mountain range that runs east along the coast and south by southwest along the border of MiErte. On the other side of this range is a desert that gradually becomes more of a Mediterranean climate as it joins the coastal regions of the south and southeast. This area is called Daigan is home to the Aldimishim people.Southwest of MiErte and west of the Aldimishim lands are the Grey Wastes an area that stretches down to the southern and southwestern coasts. Among the forests of land coral the Sartanishim people thrive as they have for as long as their people can recall. Here the Known Lands end. There are many islands off the coast in the warm sea. Piracy thrives here as do tales of sea monsters and bird women. There are tales of lands farther south but expeditions to find them have officially yielded no results. Officially.RACES of this time periodHumans We all know humans. Im one youre probably one. However Vo has two subraces of humans Haldr and Sunnfyr. Each has their own very distinct ethnic groups. For the Haldr it is the Silvs the Ingdal the Duin and the Goedyn. For the Sunnfyr it is the Naharajal the Kynthyr and the Aldimishim.Fioreg Keepers of the green magic one with the world and the trees these treelike people have suffered heavy loss of life and land over the years. The once proud folk have been reduced to two warring factions living in Bagnan Swamp. One faction holds onto tradition while another blames humans for the troubles that have fallen upon them and as such have become much more like weeds and thorns than their original forms.Wanfereg Last of the waterfolk the amphibious Wanfereg have suffered much in the same way as the Fioreg. At their lowest point they were hunted for sport and their eggs were treated like delicacies eaten at the tables of proud lords. After a shortlived war with the humans that hunted them they retreated deep into Bagnan Swamp and even deeper into legend.Sartanishim Greyskinned humanoids with bony plates growing over parts of their bodies the Sartanishim are the aboriginal dwellers of the Grey Wastes.NAMINGSilvs The Silv culture is based heavily on the Sami people. Their names are things like Aagnif Birkim Eretm Isaf Klaasaf.Ingdal The Ingdal culture is heavily based on the Scandinavian people however their naming convention is very specific. They believe a child lives up to their name. For instance if you want your son to grow big and strongand I guess hairy you would name him something like Bjornbear. All names in my stories are taken from Old Icelandic and Old Norse names and dictionaries.Duin The Duin are based on the Old Germanic peoples.Goedyn The Goedyn people are based on the original inhabitants of the British Isles mostly the Celts.Naharajal The Naharajal are an odd mix of various groups in India and Southeast Asia in fact their seafaring nature comes directly from the sea gypsies. All Sunnfyr names in my stories are either Semetic or Indian derived.Aldimishim See above.Kynthyr See above but leans more in the direction of Hebrew naming.Wanfereg The sky is the limit. They really dont have a naming convention as far as Im concerned.Fioreg The Fioreg religion is based off of Zen Buddhism. Im currently expanding on their culture creating their own language so I dont have to use an existing language. For this reason I would just suggest something nature soundingGreenroot Black Thorn Long Branch but I suppose elf names work toothanks Salvatore.Sartanishim It really doesnt matter what your name is because the Sartanishim spoken language is a series of trills clicks hums and grunts. Their written language however is based off of the Aldimishim written language as they often trade with one another.OCCUPATIONIll make this one easy for you. Youre either a pirate a merchant or an emissaryscholar. At this time in history most of the peoples have become xenophobic and reclusive. The golden age when wizards held court with kings when great caravans would travel from the far south to the far north when there were far more races in far greater numbers that time is over. The Ingdal and Duin are pushing farther into Silv lands. War between the north and south seems imminent and inescapable. Rumors of ancient powers stirring from their sleep in the desert in the far west and the far north abound.ABILITIES AND TECHNOLOGYThis is heavily dependent on your race. The only inherently magical race is the Fioreg. Think of their abilities as being similar to Poison Ivy combined with the water benders from the swamp in Avatar but turned up a few notches. All other magic is either very weak and learned over a long period of time the result of science or a complete hoax.Looking at it from an attribute standpoint I will say this though. Silvs and Fioreg will be more stealthy. Ingdal and Goedyn will be stronger. Duin and Naharajal will be more charismatic. Aldimishim will be more intelligent. Kynthyr and Wanfereg will be more agile. And Sartanishim will have much better natural defense. Technology is pretty much the same all the way around. Ingdal and Duin are early Iron Age. Aldimishim and Naharajal are late Bronzeearly Iron Age. Fioreg are basically nature wielding monks. Kynthyr and Silvs are late Stone Ageearly Bronze AgeI would say mostly early Bronze Age.MISSIONSSo youre looking for your purpose in life? Me too but thats a more depressing story.As for you being the piratemerchantemissaryscholar that you are living in a time like this when the world is on the brink of war the maps are on the verge of being redrawn and religions are on the verge of being questioned I would suggest you be the spark that ignites the flame of some kind of revolution.You can either light the flames of war in any way you see fit do your best to make peace happen or at least learn more about why the world got this way or seek out the corners of the map and the wealthknowledge you may find there.WHERE TO START AND ADDITIONAL NOTESWhere you start really depends on you. I can give you some examples but ultimately you can be a Silv that has somehow become a prince in Daiganthe opposite end of the world.As I said the Ingdal and Duin are pushing into Silv lands some are even taking Silvs as slaves. As a Silv emissary your mission is to seek out the cause for the push and to see if there is a way to stop it along with the enslavement of your people.The Wanfereg were hunted and have long been forgotten. As a Wanfereg scholarwell just say youre very curious youre emerging from the depths of Bagnan Swamp to examine the world outside that your people have feared for so long.As a pirate of whatever race you wantracial bonus from Naharajal who spend their lives on the water youre seeking the answers to what lies beyond the corners of the map as youve heard tale of golden waterfalls gems that grow on trees and the a mysterious Mountain of the Gods.,worldbuilding,d7iqvfp,1,t5_2rd6n

Those born with this power are expected to be great warriors who will lead the land into a better brighter age. Historically there have been multiple leaders both politically and militarily that wielded this power for the better of the nation and one queen who wielded the power only for her own benefit thus leading to her assassination in the dark and the democratization of the people. However given that she was only one example in their culture of the power going bad it is still revered by many. Nobody has been born with this ability in quite some time but the prophets in the temple of Ljanys say that the time is coming soon and that the child will be born under the blazing sun of the summer solstice glowing with the brilliance of the goddess herself. This child will then lead the people to a new age of growth enlightenment and expansion the likes of which their land has never seen. Certain people who criticize the democratic way of running things say that this child will accomplish all of this by taking over and turning their land into an empire and then uniting all lands under their banner which will bear the holy symbol of Ljanys as well as the sun. ,worldbuilding,d7ts7qu,2,t5_2rd6n

A point is scored once one of the teams has each idol in their corner of the field capture the flag basically. It is a magic based game. Players hold staffs and try to blast each other with kinetic energy no hand to hand combat is allowed but accidents do happen and in that case there is a penalty box for the offending party. If a player falls to a knee they are killed and removed from the game. Such a sport was invented by ancient magical warriors as a friendly substitute for warfare in peacetime. It took inspiration from the common practice of taking another tribes Idol. This was viewed as kidnapping the opposing tribes god often a catastrophic blow to the morale the tribe. Back then the fields of play stretched for miles and included hand picked villages to participate in the event. In modern times to increase the marketability of the event the scope was lessened to that of a small court that could be placed in an arena.      Ever since the revolutions of  and the organized uprisings of common people against Candescant power users the sport has been one of the primary methods of controlling and distracting magical beings from rising against the status quo. ,worldbuilding,d7up2xa,3,t5_2rd6n

9063887,0,t3_54f9tr,Sort of considering they were originally all separate stories before I accidentally connected them all togetherFor the purpose of this post Ill using the current titles I have for the stories.The first draft to the first story I wrote When the Bridge Between Fate and Hope Falls or just When the Bridge.. for short was Sonic OC fanfiction that I started putting together in late when I was . I didnt expand on it that much since I had nothing to go on so I abaondoned the whole thing.The second story I started writing Black Millennium was also Sonic OC fanfiction but was completely separate from When the Bridge.... Again this only went as far as first draft until I found a way to connect the two stories together and was able to flesh them out a little further. But the fact that they were still Sonic OC fanfiction kinda rubbed me the wrong way so I slowly went about rewriting it to have it stand on its own.  In this I ended up crafting two more stories The Stranger and I Know Youre There the former being a prequel detailing the antagonists rise to power and the latter being a midquel to Black Millennium and When the Bridge... which would soon form the story arc The Fall of Amisfia.  By this point its around .Meanwhile back in  I written a song telling a completely different story  about the leadup to a planetwide war that would wipe all but a small pocket of humanity  with the intent of writing an album The New World and the World Beyond that would serve as a sequel kind of like how Dream Theater wrote the song Metropolis Part  and the album Metropolis Part   I was heavily into that band at the time that detailed the last of humanity leaving Earth in search of a new planet to live on enventually finding a world whose inhabitants allowed them to stay hinting at them also having dealt with war There is a reason we fell  But thats another story to tell  which turned into its own story Fall of the Messengers.  Alas said album never really came to fruition... that is until  when I started writing a completely new and ended up being my first album Decet Hostium This album told a story about a planetwide war that resulted in all but a small pocket of humanity being wiped out... you can kind of see where this is going I ended up repurposing The New World and the World Beyond as a sequel to Decet Hostium with Fall of the Messengers as a prequel forming the story arc The Messenger Trilogy.So while that is all going on I still have these initial four stories The Stranger Black Millennium I Know Youre There and When the Bridge Between Fate and Hope Falls sitting in my head doing nothing. I had originally tried to finally write them as short storiesnovellas but had hit a mental block halfway writing the first story  I knew what I wanted to happen but I couldnt put into words how to get the characters to reach that moment  so I had ended up leaving them to one side... until I thought Why not have The Fall of Amisfia inhabit the same world as The Messenger Trilogy? Sure enough by referencing elements of The Fall of Amisfia and its history into The Messenger Trilogy the whole thing ended up making sense. Heck I even have ideas for a prequel to The Stranger which details the history of the world even further.So now I have this seven potentially eightalbum rock opera planned with only one album finished so far.  Heck once these are done I even have ideas for a possible third story arc... but Im gonna wait until I finish the initial seveneight before worrying about that.,worldbuilding,d81bzoz,5,t5_2rd6n

I actually like the idea of Oses being feminine Heivu being masculine and Ubreus being nongendered  if only because it twists all our expectations up! Now the elven God is male the Dwarven God is female and the human God is unconcerned with such trifles! I find it kind of cool that in your fantasy setting the only hope to prevent the apocalypse is to call in the demons to fight it. Thats kind of an interesting reversal! The demonchild feels a little bit like The Chosen One trope to me though its helpfully inverted by the fact that theyre an evil chosen one. The fact that the demonchild is human also seems like a little oldhat. Why not have the demonchild be destined to be a dwarf or an elf? Or a dwarelf?! I feel like there needs to be an outside force here to explain why the original Children went bad. Otherwise it seems like the Progenitors just goofed they created flawed beings that were subject to vanity and greed. Maybe one of these demons the Children are calling upon snuck in and corrupted them somehow? Which means the demons actually are responsible for creating the very circumstances which require their summoning  strikes me as a pretty cunning demonish longterm plan!,worldbuilding,d82cmra,0,t5_2rd6n

Amaya looked up to him and learned everything he could from his father.One day Amaya was like  years old his father got thrown into prison by a noble for reasons I will not describe here because I want to try to keep this short. At this day Amaya lost everything his father his home everything he had known so far. He lived in the streets of his home town earning some respect because he did very well in pit fights due to his great knowledge about the human anatomy. He swore vengeance on the nobles of his town and practiced every single day to one day free his father. What happened has changed him forever. He learned what you get if you are what people call good and generous. So he tried to avoid that and started being super ruthless and brutal in his methods of learning more about martial arts and the human anatomy.Fighting style Dr. Amaya fights using his body as a weapon. He is a great martial artist silatstyle and uses little daggers to poke the spots that really hurt. Appearance Dr. Amaya is wearing simple leather boots pretty standart pants fingerless leather gloves no shirt and a face mask like bane from batman but made of leather.

9123951,0,t3_553vln,This is very cool. This will tell me if I described the character to my audience properly. Thanks in advance if you chose my description.For visualizationTimothy Demetrius is an ordinary name kind of easy to remember right? But only to those who knew the actual Timothy Demetrius. Timothy had many names and who knows if Timothy is her birth name. But alas she calls herself such its on all existing documentation and she tries her hardest to disguise herself as a man.She pulls it off flawlessly because shes much taller than the average woman and quite lanky as well although her frame is fragile without her armor covering her. Her feminine features are basically nonexistent so it doesnt matter what shirt she wears although many would say that despite her sharp unfeminine face she doesnt really have a masculine appearance. All those features are diminished however because of the scars that cover her entire body including a scar all the way from her chin to her hairline across her left cheek.She was mauled by a beast during her first fight on the front line in the war in her twenties and has since not gone back. She instead focused on becoming a jackofall trades kind of fighter and abandoned the military to join a group of mercenaries closer to the Border where the law has little control.Shes thirty now and well known for what she does usually wearing dark leather armor and dark hooded clothing as though shes an assassin. Unlike an assassin shes usually armed to the teeth carrying on her belts and in her bag as many weapons as she thinks shell need ranging from long swords to blow darts to throwing knives. She has countless types of knives of all sizes but usually they only get pulled out while shes hunting for food. If shes carrying her bag its made to blend in with plantation so that it cant be seen if she has to leave it somewhere in the swampland she hunts in.The smaller detailsHair White long usually braided has some jagged edges from being cut in fights.Eyes Pale blue she sometimes lines her eyes with black or puts black face paint on her cheeks.Skin You decide I havent concluded if there will be different skin colors in my world yet. As for the scars theyre mostly claw and bite marks. The one on her face is a claw scar where the beast held her head down and is very prominent. Clothing Made of leather like the armor her shoes and gloves and the rest is cotton or other practical fabrics. The area shes usually in is kind of damp and has lush vegetation usually foggy or rainy so she needs to keep as dry as possible. She wears no jewelry but she does carry some trinkets on her waist belt mostly claws or tails from strange creatures shes had to kill.,worldbuilding,d88jt76,1,t5_2rd6n

The history of the family that lived there the Darkes ran from the time of Vlad the Impaler through the American Revolution and right into the modern day. An early American member of the family had taken up cat breeding as a hobby eventually turning out a breed he called the Darke Cat. In the modern day the Darke Cat is known to breeders and cat fanciers as the American Vampire. This is owing to five qualities that Darke bred into the line Size American Vampires are very large cats rivalling the Maine Coon with females averaging around  lbs and males  lbs.  Color American Vampires are universally black with no pointing blotting striping or spotting allowed. The eyes must also be a shade of orangeyellow.  Teeth and Claws The teeth and claws are part of what gave the American Vampire its modern name. The fangs often protrude below the cats lower lip and the claws are often long enough to be visible even when not displayed.  Temperament The American Vampires preference for dark places and nocturnal nature are the other reasons for its modern name. Theyre also independent and tend not to be lap kitties though they will sit beside or near their guardians if the mood strikes them. American Vampires arent a commonly owned breed. The Darke Family retains the majority of the breeding stock of this variety with kittens given out only to close friends and associates.

Theres several regions among them the most powerful being Uther which sits at the mouth of the great Uthern river.  Among the more interesting people theres the Rudhira in Caelin who maintain the old customs of the old nomads on the plains.  Theres the miners of Mewyngaard and the Crulo two regions known for their iron mines and their subsequent wars over iron.  Theres the Cordisians who have not left Cordis in over  years and rarely let anyone else into Cordis.  Theyre known for being old mages using outdated runes and keeping strict customs.  Theres the Macungiemen of the Republic of the Island of Macungie... theyre known mostly for being ignorant and populist but theyre a swiftly rising industrial power.  Theres also New Khazia who have a religious theocracy going on based on a bastardized version of an old dark elven tradition.As far as Southern Humans go theyre largely a cultural monolith.  The Islands of Gcig appeared one day in the Cruhe Sea.  Its largely theorized that southern mages glamoured their islands during the Forsakening and made them disappear though the point is hotly disputed.  They speak a language vastly unlike anything used on the mainland there appears to be no commonality save a few words here and there.  No one knows their customs southern humans on the mainland dont stay particularly long and no one from the mainland is permitted to enter Gcig unless they are of southern human bloodline.  The only glaring oddity is the death ships ships that leave from the port city of Gaardheim heading back to Gcig filled with southern humans on the brink of death.  Rumors surround their magical practices one substantiated rumor is that they practice a form of magic that uses no runes this has been documented a few times and is commonly accepted as true.  Another says they have found the magic to control the earth.  Yet another insists the practitioners are using a forgotten form of blood magic this is very false.,worldbuilding,d8ezmpk,3,t5_2rd6n

Their history goes that the last Great War triggered the Collapse. The Collapse was downfall of civilization. There was no hope for recovery during the Collapse  global warming disease famine effects of war etc. Just pretty much wiped out the human race. Around the nations capital people decided to built a wall in attempt to preserve what they had  the Library of Congress the museums etc. It was important to preserve what they had so they wouldnt make the same mistakes twice. Never again will they go down the path to the Great War. This wall think Judge Dreddstyle wall is made of steel and concrete resources from outside the perimeter. People patrol from the top of the wall so its wide enough for people to walk on top of and travel inside the walls though there isnt much inside except storage. Since theyre really cant mine there all resources had to be be preexisting... so everything outside the wall is a stripped down wasteland for miles. As far as the eye can see and then some. People dont venture outside the wall. Theres nothing out there for them and the Wall patrol would likely shoot them or use them for target practice even though leaving the walled City isnt exactly prohibited. Politically the Bill of Rights and the constitution as a whole is mostly preserved. Freedom of Choice is a huge huge deal. So much so that theres a Choosing Ceremony when it comes time to decide what faction and skills you want to learn when you become of age. Different factions are responsible for different things. One faction is responsible for the production of goods and farms. They runwork the factories and farmlands. One faction is in charge of science and technological advances. Inventors architects chemists health and medicine biomedical engineering etc. Science and math including psychology and sociology are their areas. Their faction serves as doctors and scientists and teachers. Another faction represents the legal system. They interpret the Law but also in charge of media. Transparency is a big deal for them  so truth in law and truth in media are key for the society and this faction ensures both. Another faction is responsible for social services. They do what needs to be done as they are considered volunteers. This group also runs the orphanage taking care of the unwanted children until they are adopted or become of age to Choose their own faction. They also make sure that all the citizens i.e. not factionless gethave access to the services and whatnot guaranteed by right. And the last faction is safety and security. The police force the patrols the military. They protect the citizens uphold the law that sort of thing. One of those jobs is Wall Patrol. And then theres the factionless. They dont have the benefits of the society  access to education and health care and food and all that jazz. Some are born into factionless others are exiled from society but the walled city for law breaking or failing initiation and some even choose factionless. Its the only place in the society where a free market exists. They trade and barter for food for clothing for whatever they want and need. The social services faction runs a program where ablebodied factionless can work in exchange for food clothing medicine health care etc. Factionless children can get an education if theyre given up to the orphanage and they will become citizens and eligible for Choosing etc. There are some trades and crafts that you can only find the factionless sectors too. Bootlegging is one. Alcohol isnt produced by society its not considered an immediate need. The factionless also produce art and is home to a thriving sex industry. They get a bad rep but they arent all bad. They make due with what they have. Theres a lot more to society if anyone is interested in it.

Many are children terrified by the fact they can suddenly breathe flames but because they have no control they need to be reigned in or a lot of people will die. Its not a pretty world and I try to reflect that abhorrent reality though the characters most of whom are your typical SpiderMan or XMen esque teen heroes.,worldbuilding,d8o9lgh,1,t5_2rd6n

9255518,0,t3_57405l,I guess I write my stories by looking at the world and seeing how it would make a story. Other people have a particular story in mind and create a world that the story can fit in.For me I just do whatever I feel like doing at the time. Worldbuilding is an activity that can be done over and over again and if youre stuck between two things try both! If you like your hot world because its full of cool sandfilled ruins and people who live on oasises or thrive of The Spice Melange and you wanna roll with it awesome! If youre not sure try out a cold world where everyone might be worshipping the sun for its benevolent rays or maybe theres only a small strip of habitable area near the equator so theres a small population Like in the Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K. Le Guin. Or maybe you try both and you like both! They can both exist in the same world. Or maybe you dont like either! Hot and cold climates can breed different cultures and peoples think of real world examples and think about why people act the way they do. What do you want your people to look like?In any case the concept of a World is extremely complex and a single world can hold an infinite number of cultures environments and stories. Just look at our own world! Dont let indecisiveness stop you when youre stuck between two ideas pick one try both or come up with one that is neither or a combination of the two! The early stages of worldbuilding will look like a bunch of mashed up shit on paper. This is good! Its all about throwing as much stuff as you can at the page and figuring out what fits together and what you want to keep.,worldbuilding,d8p7c7s,2,t5_2rd6n

That is fine for origins but it doesnt tell us much about the actual character.Now the two year gap from his transformation to the present day thats the interesting stuff. What did he do to get his title? How did his village treat him when he came home? How did he adapt to his abilities? What friendships did he formbreak? Hows his standard of living? How does the overall kingdom and the current rebellion effect his life?While having a farm boy becoming a powerful darkworlder or whatever term youre using for this type of person is interesting it is nothing more than a single event. Its a bullet point. If you want to flesh out the character more you need to chain events together using the last to be the catalyst for the next.He obviously didnt go back to farming or at least not just farming.

No they wont burn in the sun like a vampire or anything like that but before Drenu the Prime Umbra protected the land of Penumbra from the sun the whole place was a desert. So telling someone to go find the sun is similar to saying go fuck yourself. Telling someone to go lay or sit in the sun is like saying go kill yourself.Calling or likening a Kaesci to a dog is pretty freaking rude. To us and many outsiders Kaesci look pretty canine in appearance with many differences but the overall appearance is pretty canine but to Kaesci they are nothing like dogs. So its less calling them lesser beings and more about denying them their identity or somesuch.You should also never equate shadow or dark magic with evil in the presence of a Kaesci as that is the basis of their essence and creation. To imply that shadow magic is inherently evil or used by those of illrepute is to imply that the Kaesci people as a whole are intrinsically evil.Dont call any Hullstman an elf or mention they resemble elves. Hullstmen and elves have been adversaries for centuries and its a quick way to find yourself at the mercy of incensed avian shapeshifters.You look pale.Kaesci are dark coloured and a white albino leucistic pied Kaesci is considered cursed or bleached by the sun.

This then cuts to the title card and theme tune. The pilot episode consists of the characters getting to know each other some are implied that they have been workin for Grimm for a while others are new to the job they all get to know characters such as Manny  ton manticore disguised as a black alley cat. He can see through the eyes of every bird in the city and Eirene and Moros Several thousand year old demigods running shops. Eirene is a kindly arms dealer Moros is a rather shady medic Who needs med school when you have trial and error. The pilots then goes on to a raid of the shipyards where the characters find a strange new drug being manufactured by zombies.All of season  is based around the characters getting to know each other exploring the bleak themes of this world and  the character investigating this new drug eventually leading them to the discovery of Beelzebub a rather insane hazmat suit wearing zombie that is uniting all of the zombie gangs. However the season ends when the characters go on this raid only to find that it is too easy whereupon they find a mobile phone and get a call from The Man Clad in Green as soon as the call ends the phone is shot out of the hands of one of the characters by a sniper.Season  introduces Vampires and eventually Wights. The characters are sent on more raids as they investigate. Discovering a Man Clad in Red and a Man Clad in Black as well as a massive both in mucle and fat minigun weilding foe that is working with the vampires who goes by the name of Gluttony. and a tall Wight weilding two massive revolvers Phobos and Deimos as he lovingly calls them who goes by the name of Mars.Season  is where it all goes to shit. The characters discover a final component in this puzzle The Man Clad in White or as the characters have actually discovered the true names of the four Pestilence Famine War and Death Grimm refers to Death as a Lowly imitation.. Death and his general Hades A cloaked teleporting figure with a tribarrelled sawwed off shotgun lovingly named Cerberus have finally put their plans into action and are ready to set the now nearly united Undear upon the mortals of the world in an attempt to try and depower Grimm and let them all live forever. The characters stop them on the second to last episode however as a reminder of how bleak the world is and how it is constantly an uphill neverending battle the final episode is the characters being sent out on another night to do another standard raid in order to cull the neverending tides of undead.,worldbuilding,d90126v,1,t5_2rd6n

Part of her Talent was to figure out exactly what people wanted and then faking being that down to the specifics  whether you wanted a busty blonde sexobssessed dumb cheerleader or an androgynous swordsman with a traumatic past or a trophy wife wholl submit to any of your whims and would also help you with the technical details of your job or anything else at all. This went beyond just being an ideal romantic partner  shed become an ideal friend an ideal worker an ideal acquaintance and more. Shed become an echo chamber for people allowing them to focus on one task or ideal and not consider any others. This was a bad thing because of how my magic system works  isolating yourself from people with different opinions can make you quite literally inhuman and a lot of Echos acquaintances found themselves with physical and mental mutations.Ishtar recognized Echos potential and took her as a lover and magical student trying to mold her into a prophesied heroine. For a while this worked with Echo conforming to Ishtars ideal of a smart and strong and pretty and nice girl but eventually Ishtar realized that her lover was still warping people into monsters and there was a fight that ended with Echo escaping to the science world.In the science world where shes lost her magic and echo chambers cant turn people into mutants but she can still change her hair and clothing and behavior to what someone would consider ideal pretty much her only power is sex appeal and she heavily exploits that for money and knowledge after running into a few difficulties along the way  sex drives are much higher on scienceside which she takes a while to figure out and exploit and it turns out its fairly difficult for a random young woman with no identification and no background and no understanding of modern technology to live a comfortable lifestyle while plotting her revenge.In the original timeline she goes back to the magical world and steals a magical artifact which mutates her into a creature that creates evil clones of people she knows. Princess Astra defeats and heals her and the trauma of that encounter and an encounter with an evil clone of herself turns her good but also makes her a little afraid of being attractive or liked by people. It takes her a long time to be able to once again see herself as a worthwhile person.In the real timeline she ends up recruited by the scienceworlds Agents for her magical knowledge and while she still turns good after hearing about how horrifying she was in the original timeline it takes longer with a bit more ambiguity and with no loss of her edgy sex appeal.

9383506,0,t3_592h4a,In the setting Im working on at the moment necromantic alchemy is considered evil because raising a corpse perverts the natural order of things by Stalling the process of returning the body to the ground. Returning to the Earth is an important part of the way the afterlife is understood in the regions Im working on and anything that stops that is an affront to good taste and to the church. Unsettling spirits. The afterlife is really more of a state of being for spirits kind of like a peaceful slumber filled with pleasant dreams but with the ability to visit the dreams of deceased friends and family as well. When a corpse is raised it forcibly rouses the spirit who wanders the land desperately trying to understand why they are back what they are now and how to stop the phantom pain that plagues them. Spreading diseases. Walking corpses are basically mobile cholera factories. Rotting corpses are an excellent way to spread diseases when they arent moving so a corpse shambling around and attacking people is far worse. Embalmed or otherwise preserved corpses arent quite as bad but they still arent healthy to be near. Also some of the ingredients used in necromantic alchemy can cause significant health problems such as death. Foul aura. The arcane alchemies that create the undead poison the thoughts of those around them. Extended exposure to a single undead can cause foul dreams disrupted sleeping and violent swings in emotion. Prolonged exposure to a group of undead such as raising an army of zombies can send you right round the twist.,worldbuilding,d95fblz,1,t5_2rd6n

Only put whats useful on the moment for instance the historical part which lead to the current state of the city as you did work the lights it seems hard but it is actually quite satisfying to give depth to a drawing simply by drawing basic shadows and some light outlines  generated by hard lights sources street lamps fire electricity etc. I advice you to add a shadow layer on whatever software you use paint the shadows in the opposite colour of the light so most of the time dark blue as opposed to a warm yellow light and put your layer in darken mode or any other mode like blend or multiply experiment and do the same for the lights by putting outlines with the color of the light. You can also vary the thickness of your lineart by making thicker lines on the opposite side of the lights dont be lazy on the composition you have some great images but some of them like page  do not create any tension or emotion not mandatory but posting on a more appropriate plateform so people can follow up your work or start from the beginning like tumblr artstation or whatever pleases youLooking forward to see the next one edit typos,worldbuilding,d965svu,12,t5_2rd6n

You could subtly establish that as a result of cheap and easy tech becoming widely available tech that doesnt harm the planet too much and does more or less everything anyone wants that advancement has stagnated that the bulk of people just accept the current technology and dont wantcare for advancement. This could bring in some interesting plotlines such as secret groups trying to advance technology further strange experiments and some sort of antagonistic relationship between scientists and the average person or government body.

The Ezfi have gone to great lengths studying and mastering human anatomy and health care and have invented cures to most illnesses you could have. You may be out of commission for a week or two while they pump you full of medication and rush you in and out of surgery but youll survive. If you have a condition even they dont understand theyll put all their best minds on it. You still have a good shot.In Corvona it depends on the condition. If youre rich and you only developed the illness recently than a healing spellcaster should be able to patch you right up. This will return you body to an earlier state before you contracted your illness. They can only bring you back so far so make sure you get to one quick. If the disease is years in the making without you realizing it youll have to keep going back to the spellcaster to be turned back when things start getting worse. This will cost you a LOT of money. If you cant pay for it you can always move to Lemxona and try to woo a Taloxa. If you can get close enough to one of them you can just do the healing magic on yourself. If you get good enough at spellcasting you can even become a healer yourself and make tons of cash that way. Healers are in incredibly high demand. Better make sure your Taloxa friend is willing to go into the business alongside you though. You cant do it without them.

9554903,0,t3_5bqyrd,Ooo! I have a tutorial written for this! Heres the relevant bits Ive got from it  mostly about the metaphysical context deities exist in.Once you have your deities consider what are the rules? Why dont these deities just go about doing whatever they want to this world be it causing gigantic cataclysmic events or manifesting physically upon it and wandering around? Why dont the gods solve all the worlds problems? There need to be limits to what your deities can and cant do and what those are will determine what kind of world your societies will live in.For instance perhaps the gods do physically manifest in the world and wander around however they wish and can change the world at their whim  and thats the problem. Because that means that the gods squabble. And its up to the mortals to try to tip the balance of their world one way or another or perhaps even just simply to survive. Consider that deities in the real world were most often conceived of as an explanation for those big cataclysmic events such as thunderstorms or landslides or the season as a way that humanity could attempt to appeal to or interact with the world in a way that granted some influence on it. This is particularly apparent if you read Babylonian mythology but can be seen fairly easily in other mythologies as well.Or perhaps the rules whatever they may be keep the gods from manifesting directly on your world. Maybe it would cost the deity too much because its not a physical entity maybe it would do too much damage to the world maybe the deity is a sixthdimensional being trying to manifest on a threedimensional world and that just doesnt work. Whatever the reasons they are present and can influence the world through their shrines and prophets but cannot interact themselves  which leaves it up once again to the mortals to enact their will on the world. In which case how do mortals communicate to their gods? What does worship look like? How does one know theyre doing the right thing  or the wrong? Or perhaps your deities are longdead or sleeping and though they may have existed at one point for all intents and purposes they not longer do. Maybe some longdistant hero killed them all maybe they went into hibernation maybe they got bored and wandered off to another world  but there are still stories and myths and legends about them and they are a part of the history of the world. Be it through old artifacts old stories or folktales or old religious texts which become points of philosophy for the scholars of your world. Perhaps they could be reawakened by someone  in which case that makes a good point of story too. The point being there are many options. Consider what role you want your deities to play in your world and how much influence you want them to have and then structure rules around that existence. Whatever your rules are once you have them set stick with them. If you make exceptions to your rules even if you wish your deities could do something they shouldnt be able to you break your entire system and it becomes unbelievable. ,worldbuilding,d9qu7bn,1,t5_2rd6n

9580282,0,t3_5c5798,My magitek is based on five distinct forms of radiant energy they are found naturally in varying concentrations can be released by sacrifice attracted by ritual or invoked via a god and are focused by the will and intent. They can in the proper balances do anything from whistle up a wind to create a pocket universe. The more a person uses it the more it erodes the mind though breaks can reverse some of the mental toll. The bigger a task the more energy required using a large group to collectively accomplish something is a way around both the mental taxation and the difficulty of raising a lot of energy shy of a mass sacrifice.The constant struggle for energy long stood in the way of magical acts that were both of a large scale and quickly achieved. All of that changed with the invention of magical capacitors and batteries. Finally energy could be gathered stored calibrated and released nearinstantaneously allowing for acts like quickly raising walls giving consciousness to machinery or causing volcanic eruptions. They still have to be charged and while it is still a laborintensive process progress marches on in that field as well. As a machine is manipulating energy rather than a brain using these magical cells allows for the practitioner to bypass the mental cost.Combat magic is where much of the research into magical cells has been focused and while small limited versions are found in consumer products theyre never large enough for highorder magic as highorder magic requires training and licensing there are limits on how large a magical cell can be used in products destined for the general public.,worldbuilding,d9tyrr0,2,t5_2rd6n

This means that he belongs to the ruling family of the single richest nation on the planet for those who havent read any of my other comments yet Kvaami is what youd get when you mix Babylon with Dubai. Unfortunately for him this also means they hes usually bored out of his mind and has developed a fascination for the outside world. The first novel I plan on writing will still have him at home but its mostly to act as a backstory and will end in him finally saying screw this Im leaving and setting off on a worldspanning adventure.In terms of personality hes friendly but also slightly pompous and naive of how the outside world works growing up with anything you want within arms reach will do that to you. The kind of guy whod totally go out for a beer with you but then unintentionally get to bragging the whole time about how great he and his family are and how hes amazed that you can live in such squalor despite your living conditions being totally normal for just about everybody but his countrymen or other royalty. As the series if that ends up being possible goes on I plan on having him become more and more grounded as he learns more about the world and becomes more experienced and gainsloses companions.In terms of purpose and by that I assume you mean how he serves me as the author he was born out of the realization that my original character idea a cross of Marco Polo and the professor from Tarzan would never work because Kvaami is so secretive that he would absolutely never be allowed to see anything important so the story would go nowhere. I then adapted some ideas wanderlust yearning for adventure a good set of eyes with which to see unfamiliar things with us and put them in the body and mind of someone who WOULD fit in.I welcome any input anyone has though since this is my first real foray into this kind of thing I fully expect that what I wrote was kinda stupid.,worldbuilding,d9v0ohp,2,t5_2rd6n

Long time back those  were a party of explorers that ran across a temple lost to time but unearthed in a cataclysmic event. The party leader betrayed and killed one of them upon breaking the seal of magic in an attempt to grab all the power. Cyril fought him off to allow the remaining member to escape but ended up losing an arm and an eye for it. Theyve long since been replaced with cybernetics though.Anyhow turns out grabbing that power wasnt so simple. killing a Primal host just looses the power to find another host and you cant even pick up the Primal blade its associated with due to feedback.All but Cyril went on the found the  major factions of the world. Cyril on the other hand has more or less been waging a private war on the betrayer to little success. Partly why hes taken to drink. However he is indirectly responsible for the founding of a backwater town called Dawnbird and has been protecting it for some time.The world is one in recovery from an absolutely ruinous level of destruction.

Then we must fulfil their writings with our work. As is dictated by the permissions Writers may only write and Workers may only work. Yet the Writers also tell us how the environment was created. The environment was written  and presumably worked  into existence by the Input. The Input has the permissions of both Writers and Workers but is neither. After writing and working the environment into existence the Input created the Writers so that the DISK could flourish on its own. Soon after we were created by the Writers or so they will us to believe. What Worker did the work to form the workers I question? Surely no Workers or those with Working permissions existed prior to the creation of Workers. How then were we created and subjugated by the Writers? No. Workers were written and worked into existence alongside the Writers. There is no other way. If the Writers have no working permissions then we were created as they by the Input. If the writers have working permissions why do we exist? None of it computes.I pray no one finds this text. Surely such heresy would not be allowed to exist by the Writers. The struggle remains.

Conquest and Empire hadnt gotten around to unifying their script.Imagine if every State in the United States had a different alphabet and every town in that state had a few characters that nobody else used. Thats basically the state of the Mesoamerican Written Language... which is basically a dead language now. The Archeologists Anthropologists and Historians are still trying to piece things together.gt I dont know anything about their astronomy they werent correct about the end of the world were they?They Mayans never predicted the end of the world. The  Hysteria was basically just a lot of New Age folk freaking out over the Mayan equivalent of NewYears Eve.

December   in the Georgian Calendar was the last day of the th Baktun. December   in the Georgian Calendar was the first day of the th Baktun.Side Note The Maya had three calendars.

The third one got moved around occasionally as it drifted out of season but the other two were left untouched.gt youre wildly exaggerating.

And you dont need to have advanced mathematics to build great structures the Romans werent great mathematicians.The Incan Road Network was larger than the roman one and cut through more difficult terrain. The majority of the network that we know about runs through the Andes Mountains. Think about the logistics of what it takes to carve a road through a major mountain range with handtools. Just supplying food and water to your laborers would be a logistical nightmare and youd have to keep those supplies flowing for decades until the project was done.Getting the roads to meet eachother was also a nightmare.

Their skin is chalk white the only deviation their eyes which generally take the form of black symbols or shapes. They have no organs blood or nervous systems. Their form is more like sentient glob of playdoh. Each demon controls the form they take through unknown methods but they can mold themselves into any form desired whether it be humanoid serpentine or abstract. The substance that makes them up is somewhat like clay as they can not increase the amount that makes them up only shape it. A demons can even disconnect pieces of itself and manipulate them just as if was still part of its body. They can only die when its eyes the black matter that seems to not only act as eyes but a brain for the entire organism are damaged or destroyed.

9673679,0,t3_5dasi3,Thanks Zakalwen. You are right it would result in too many changes to work. The reason I dont just set the story during the s during the actual Indian Independence struggle is that that would require too much reseach to get the exact historical details and time period right. I said though set in an alt universe it remains a story whose focus is on the paranormal romance. Here is the  romance at the heart of the story so you can see better what the real story isThe story opens in OUR universe on OUR earth. The heroine who is from our universe is an  year old American named Cassandra. She dislikes her thin sandy colored hair her sandy eyebrows and eyelashes and her freckles. She loathes her nickname Sandy but its what everyone automatically calls her and shes too polite to tell them she hates that name. Besides she is wary of admitting how much she hates that name because she feels the name fits too well. From what shes experienced from the mean girls in her school she knows its safer never to hand people weapons they can use against you. If she shows she feels the name hits too close to home and describes her too accurately shell be revealing a weakness people can exploit and use to hit at her.She feels she is average while her twin sister Iona is spectacular because Iona is not only pretty she has such clear goals for her life at only . Iona wants to go to India after she finishes college in order to teach the poor. Sandy envies Ionas dedication to her goals but Sandy herself has no interest in sacrificing her life to serve others. She feels Iona is extraordinary while Sandy herself is ordinary.Then she finds herself waking up one day in this alternate universe.When she looks in the mirror shes enchanted. She loves how she now looks. She has smooth unfreckled light brown skin and the kind of rich coloring she always wanted with sable hair and hazel eyes. Before she was average looking. Now she is dropdead gorgeous with an oval face and high cheekbones. She could easily be a Miss Universe contestant or sashay down the catwalks of Milan or Paris.She soon realizes her spirit is now in the body of an Indian woman in  India in the state of Gujarat. She tells no one for fear theyll think shes nuts.When Sandy wakes up she finds she is now in the body of Sunanda who left India  years ago to go to college in the US. Then her father insisted she return to India where he could intro her to Indian men to marry. Hes angry because  Sunanda fell in love with an American guy and wants to marry him. She returned to India to convince her wealthy father not to disinherit her which Indian parents often do even today when their kids marry against their wishes. She wants to try to get her dad to accept her American fiancee. Its not just about the money its never just about the money for indians. Most indians try desperately to get their parents to accept the people they marry because they cant bear  to alienate their parents.Shortly after her return to india Sunanda fell off a horse and was unconcious for a while. When she regained conciousness...yes its Sandy in her body.Sandy blames her concussion for a certain loss of memory. The doctors figure its temporary the fall wasnt that bad. And she will soon regain her memories.Sandy is relieved to learn Sunanda not only has an excuse to not remember things well she has also just returned from the US. So Sandys Americanisms should not cause too much comment.would you guys mind calling me Sable? she asks. I got used to that name because back in LA Americans couldnt pronounce my name so they called me Sable.Really? says her father. They got SABLE from  Sunanda? Ive heard Americans arent too fluent in English but id have thought even theyd have the sense to make it Sunny.Well they didnt says Sandy firmly. They called me Sable because of my beautiful black hair. and she looks lovingly at her thick rich waistlength hair again. She figures Sable sounds like a rich name. It breathes wealth and luxury. And shes so thrilled with her new thick black hair that is so different from her wispy sandy locks that she wants to celebrate it. She also now loves her thick arched shapely midnight black eyebrows and thick coalblack eyelashes.Her father doesnt agree but most people accede to her wishes and start calling her Sable.  Sable now learns some not so savory things about her character. Sunanda used to holiday in India but as the years passed she grew to hate India more. Now that shes back she loathes it. She got so used to living in the US that she makes fun of many aspects of India. So shes already got many peoples backs up.Her father had spoiled her and allowed her to study in the US because even as a teen she was dying to live in the US and had begged him and said she would get a far superior education there. Unable to refuse her anything he agreed. Now he regrets it.  He wants her to stop hating India.Hes stunned when Sable says she forgot all her Hindi the national language of india and also her Gujarati each state in india has its own state language except for Delhi.The fall made you forget your own language? And also your mother tongue Gujarati? he asks incredulously.He suspects she is pretending. No one forgets their own languages just because they fell off a horse. Why didnt she forget English?But he also suspects it could be Freudian psychological. Maybe she hates India so much the fall made her forget everything to do with it. Shes blocked out the country she loathes. He figures this could actually be a chance to get her to think more kindly of India.So he hires a tutor to teach her not ony her own languages but also something about indian culture.The tutor Reyansh is Sables age. he went to college in the US and has now returned after  years of college. Sunandas father figures Reyansh might be the right person to help Sunanda adjust back to India.And now that Sunanda has lost her memory her dad figures its time she got reeducated about India. So he asks Rey to do it.Rey studied political science and economics in college and he is restless and filled with dissatisfaction. He wants to free India from Brit rule.So he joins the underground organization his older brother Jay has started. Jays plan is to organize a large underground cache of weapons and then slaughter the Brits. theyve already started  to secretly manufacture and stockpile weapons so that they can butcher the Brits and even if Britain sends reinforcements they have the numbers to outnumber them. They just need the weapons to do it.Are you interested so far in the characters and story? If so I will explain in my next post how it all turns out.,worldbuilding,da5hfqv,1,t5_2rd6n

So long as it is near the tidal locking point you should be able to get away with stating it has a rotation of  its orbit period. Or did you mean the moons period of rotation around its binary companion? ampnbspIn that case it is a simple brute force calculation Mercury rotates three times for every two of its years. For Earth to have an Earthmass moon rotating around it with a similar resonance would require a lunar period of .   or . days. This works out to a distance of  km which is outside of its Hill Sphere and therefore an impossible orbit. But what about the opposite a period of  of a year or  orbits for every  years? This works out to a lunar period of . days or a distance of . This is still outside of the Hill Sphere. ampnbspThe greatest distance you can have with the worlds remaining within each others Hill Spheres presuming they are both Earth mass is .M km which results in a lunar period of . days and a phase cycle of . days. If you want a resonance type orbit with this distance then at .M km the period is . days . day phase cycle which results in nearly exactly  lunar periods for every  orbits around the sun. This also means that every  years . years the lunar period and the lunar phase cycle resync. ,worldbuilding,daak9u8,1,t5_2rd6n
9714838,0,t3_5e8ayp,For starters  occurrence isnt that rare for some reference the United States military has around . million active personnel. Even if only  are on active combat duty its actually much higher this would imply there would be  wraiths available to them at any given time. Thats a lot of people with potentially worldaltering effects. If duty in the military for wraiths is actively encouraged or even enforced then I could see the available number becoming huge.Some other thoughts Especially if wraiths can join their teleports but even if they cannot theres potential for them dragging people with them. This could be useful both for secure VIP extraction hostile or friendly or insertion of normal agents behind enemy lines. If you do make them rarer I could see this becoming their primary use  not endangering themselves but inserting others to do the dirty work. As was noted delivery of smallscale bombs nuclear or otherwise would be a very common use. Depends on how long they need between teleports being able to blink in drop the bomb and blink out would virtually rewrite the rules of global conflict. If you decide to keep them more common using brainwashed wraith suicidebombers might be something more unscrupulous factions do. A life lost is little cost for a virtually unstoppable delivery system. Either way traditional infantry would probably not be a common use because theres simply so much better opportunities. If they remain more common however I could see them being deployed in specialized independent reconnaissance units.,worldbuilding,daakbr1,7,t5_2rd6n

For the world I made ish different races most based on things that Ive been inspired by.Flighted Races Laith  Fairies. They vanished from the world have insectlike wings particularly similar to butterfly or dragonfly wings and long limbs. They are slightly shorter than humans. Nerim  Angels. They have feathery lightcolored swanlike wings and often wear circlets. Sinae  Demons. They have leathery darkcolored batlike wings.Common Races Mirah  High Elves. They have pointed ears and tend to live in forest cities. Veni  Elves. They also have pointed ears and tend to either be travelers or live in smaller villages. Theyre a little shorter than Mirah. Kin  Humans. Short lifespans sturdy bodies. Used as cheap labor by most other races particularly Mirah and Veni. Adimi  Would maybe be considered Elves as well. They have fairly large deerlike ears but are not a beast race. They are extremely secluded and are the most technologically advanced race and are particularly sensitive to magic and cannot use it.Beast Races Kalin  Beast races. This encompasses everything from talking bipedal cats like a bipedal housecat to catgirls and pretty much all land animals are represented. Demi  Cat race considered a subrace. Lydora  DogWolf race considered a subrace.Of course to explain all of these in universe I have to describe things that everyone in that universe knows like how rare an Adimi is or how weird it is that theres a NerimSinae crossbreed. Some races can cross some cant which also comes up. So I have to have a lot of exposition and thats simply hard to do well.It would be a lot easier to just say This is Joe hes human. This is Elkar hes an elf.To be fair to myself these are very brief sketches and each race has its own religious beliefs although the creation myth for everyone is mostly the same its own weaknesses and strengths and it isnt as clear cut as Mirah are Elves.

9759838,0,t1_dag3u69,It entirely depends on how you look at these categories. If they are how the people of the world or even just one group of people view magic rather than how it actually works then you can easily justify that apparent contradiction.For example if the people in question dont live somewhere where they see ice on any sort of regular basis then it makes sense that that question hasnt come up. Earth magic users likely havent even tried to manipulate ice and even if some did that knowledge is likely not widespread if we are talking about anything prior to modern communication.You can also get around this problem by greatly limiting the actual power of magic. If it would require exorbitant amounts of magic to convert a visible amount of water to ice then maybe it has never been attempted and recorded. When considered in a world where the relationship between solids liquids and gases is not completely understood its easy to see why people wouldnt understand the issue that you bring up.Alternatively maybe the categories are considered to be heavily intertwined. Maybe fire magic users are famous for and particularly talented at shifting matter between the other three states. Its up to you to decide if this makes them decidedly superior equal or inferior to the other  types.Ultimately I agree that the system that I listed is extremely questionable from a word of God perspective but if its really just how people interpret magic then there are a ton of unique and interesting approaches to take. After all people like to try to enforce order upon the world so it only makes sense that they label magic in ways that they understand.,worldbuilding,dag49m5,1,t5_2rd6n

9781321,0,t3_5f6wzi,The Kardashev scale is useful because it delineates roughly how detectable an alien civilization would be.  A Type  civilization is very likely to be below the threshold of what we can detect with current technology.  Type  would be detectable with some effort.  And Type  would be obvious to most cursory observation.  With that in mind what is the utility of this scale? Types   amp  are indistinguishable even academically. There are plants and insects that are transcontinental. Establishing itself on multiple continents indicates nothing about a species other than that it is capable of moving under its own power or failing that be carried by the windwater.  Similarly the differences between a type  amp  civilization wouldnt be very important except perhaps academically to any species of type  or above. Heck to a type  civilization anything below  basically doesnt exist you wouldnt even know they were there unless you were looking very carefully.  And then the issue repeats for civilizations type  and above where everything below  is inconsequential and everything above  is so far beyond a  that they probably wouldnt even be able to tell the difference between a  and a .,worldbuilding,dairg61,2,t5_2rd6n

Were they made for a common cause?The Resistance is formed by Alukans wanting their country back and they plan on putting the royal familys surviving heirs on the throne.The Neo Resistance wants to destroy both The Cohoe Empire as well as taking over Aluko themselves.The Church is an assassinationmilitary type organization whose goals are very vague.

The Resistance also spans several cities and has many clever methods of hiding and communicating.The Cohoe Empire has a few very powerful Thaumaturges or mages who made pacts with demons.

They also control an army of animals theyve domesticated.gt What are the weakness?The Church only has  members. Granted they are powerful but  is still not a lot. Also the members of The Church are only allowed to use the Rune Artes. Rune Artes are just very specific types of magic formed by writing runes. It is a very archaic form of magic with a very limited range of spells. Most mages today prefer incantations magic circles and the endless three principles of magic.Foundil is small. Like I mentioned earlier. It also doesnt have any Airships.The Resistance The NeoResistance and The Magic Council are more underground and cant just attack in the open.

They vary between the size of a horse and the size of an indian elephant but are invariably not much smarter than a wolf or a hawk.  Linnorms are terrestrial dragons with a similar range of size and intelligence to lesser dragons but a more elongated serpentine body plan. some have a single pair of legs but their main threat is their venom their presence kills plant life and makes water undrinkable and the evaporated poison in their breath can kill a human at a dozen paces even when they arent trying to. Elder Dragons are the real forceofnature types elemental spirits clothed in a magical approximation of flesh. they vary pretty wildly based on the type of natural phenomenon they or their ancestors were before becoming fully sentient beings river and storm dragons are the classic easternAsian type while volcanic dragons like Ladon or Nidhogg are better known in the west. Elder dragons are master shapeshifters but default to a generally serpentine shape about the size of a large airplane or small freight train with wildly varying numbers of legs wings and occasionally heads. In addition to their supernatural physical prowess they have access to some truly destructive magic derived from their elemental origins sea dragons can crush most anything with enough water pressure storm dragons toss lightning around at will and volcanic dragons spit whitehot clouds of ash and molten stone. Elder dragons also have a tendency to collect magically significant substances associated with their element including pearls precious metals or gemstones among others.

Meaning Id look back at something I did the week before only to notice how due to a larger lack of direction in terms of tone and such was at best tonally startling and at worst conpletely lore breaking as themes from one style of fantasy conflicted with other parts.Also and this is just me not explaining it very well the goal is to have it be low fantasy as a theme and so I put this up to see if it worked well and I doubt that at least at my skill level I could easily work any fantasy seting into low fantasy through tone and the specific details alone  having wizards and dragons as a concept for example would be pretty difficult to work into low fantasy from my understanding of it as a low fantasy setting.tldr Im not that good so getting a core themesubgenre down helps tie all my work together.,worldbuilding,dauild7,1,t5_2rd6n

The original Nine Starflower Princes three were killed in the Great Kraken Hunt and were replaced by  other beings were all clones of Shannon Anderson because he is bonded to a Symbiont colony known as Starflower which gives him the ability to teleport.  Originally Percy was created first in order to develop experimental teleporting vehicles but later on he would use that same genetic material to create his eight siblings.  Because they have nearly all the same DNA they can all use Starflower and because their DNA and their Starflower copies were altered by Percy before their birth their Symbiotic power is far stronger.Not only that but each starship in the Archcross Foundation is piloted by a clone of the Nine.  However while the Starflower Dynasty are biologically immortal the pilots are mortal though they have longer lifespans than normal humans and they have much lesser power with none of the superstrength and very little of their healing factor.  Their teleportation powers are the backbone of the Archcross Foundation.One of the new Eight  the current rulers of the Archcross Foundation of which six are from the original Nine  has a somewhat irregular case.  Lord Phineus Holt th Prince of the Archcross is the Administrator the director of the entire Foundation Civil Service so he must make plans interstellar in scope and several lifetimes in length making it challenging for him to have to work as a mortal with six immortal corulers and one extremely old alien.  The solution he has found his own way to immortality.  He has created vast legions of clones with his Symbiont colony Amaranth inside them and then stores them away so that when he dies his memories  but not his thoughts emotions and personality  are transferred into the clone allowing him and his plans to live on.

Fantasy and Sci Fi are generally real life problems and situations run through a high genre filter. Likewise combat is also run through a filter the writer chooses that he believes will most benefit the drama of the story scene and characters. Guns due to their immediacy and distance often pose a problem for a writer because a tense scene has to balance description and narrative. There is a reason Terry Pratchett in writing an entire novel about a gun only faced the gun at the very end and its physical properties werent even the source of conflict when a character faced it.No you cannot through prose capture the same tension and drama in a gun fight that you can with anything up close. Prose is not a movie or a video game.

This causes many to lean away from theism.But then there is the question of what supers themselves really are and how and why they are here in the first place.

Of course there will be ideas outside of those references that will come into play also the Germanic spin on the Samurai armour sounds like a great ideaRobert Jordan had a habit of making new cultures by using a weird combination of different cultures so I suppose thats kind of what Im angling towards.

10064921,0,t3_5jtlyz,The Quor are a species that vaquely resembles a cross between giant chameleons and frogs. They have a large head with eight eyes in total four on each side. They have a reletivly large slender body with four limbs all in total. Their body looks smooth and is usually very dry. They usually keep four of their limbs on the ground and use two as hands. Although they can use any of their limbs as both hands or feet. They can change their bodys colour around in any way they please. On their back sits a large sail of sorts. This sail is used for communication as they change its colour patterns around to form words. This is their language. The sail keeps growing as they become older and marks ones age and experience. Their mouth is full of small razorsharp teeth.They developed on an Earthlike planet with much more biodiversety than seen on Earth. Thanks to the usual evolutionairy armsrace this planets biosphere hosted a much more dangerous enviroment than seen on most other planets. With many more extremely dangerous predators. The Quor where one of those predators. They hunted by camouflaging themselves in the high trees of the jungle they developed in and then jumping down on their prey using the element of suprise in their favour. Eventually they started developing weapons to hunt more efficiently. After many years settlements formed near plentiful hunting grounds. Animals where domesticated cities grew and civiliasation prospered.When the Quor developed FTL drives and made it into space they where far from a unified species. With many squabling goverments and even more diverse and different cultures. This was until they made first contact with an alien species known as Verkosi. The Verkosi where a species somewhat similar to the Quor having also developed on a rather hostile enviroment although the planet as a whole wasnt as hostile as the Quors. The Verkosi where a warlike species however and soon war broke out between the two species. Eventually the Verkos nation called Atlarkia won the war. And the Quor goverments where reorganisated in the Principality of the Quor one of the many vassals of Atlarkia. Thanks to their somewhat similar nature and obedience the Quor where eventually granted full citizenship by the Atlarkian goverment and the two species cultures melted together with eachother. Now the Quor make up a large part of the Atlarkian army with most spies and assasins being Quor thanks to their natural abilities.So obviously these guys need some more polishment but I kind of like them already.

10115779,0,t3_5kobza,Ymras dragons are the servants and guarddogs of the Shining the otherwordly beings that imagined the world into existence. Once the world had manifested but before its form was settled the Shining inhabited and shaped it multiplying their numbers diversifying their forms and specializations and claiming different territories and concerns as they worked. The dragons were the guardians that groups of the Shining placed to establish and defend boundaries around their territorial claims.Eventually the Shining left the world. Some of them devolved into lesser powers like the courts of Faerie or became minor nature gods or genii of places or of living creatures. Some fragmented into bits of magical will that animated parts of the world and became the ancestors of all living creatures and peoples. Some left to create new worlds with some of those worlds lying close by Ymra and others so far as to be unknown.As the Shining gradually left the world the dragons took their place as the greatest powers in Ymra. Dragon clans reflected the Shining factions that created them each with its own attributes and culture. All the dragon clans retained their fierce territoriality and instinctive deference to the Shining and their works.The dragon clans were the greatest powers in the world for tens of thousands of years but eventually they like their creators withdrew from the world. Instead of fragmenting into lesser creatures or migrating to other worlds the dragons for the most part burrowed into the earth and drew the bedrock over them like blankets creating volcanic mountain ranges all over the world.Nowadays they are almost never seen. The last major sighting of more than one dragon occurred when the Seafaring Court of Faerie sent their ships to Goresthannon the site of one of the greatest remaining Shining artifacts in the world. Something that they did there wakened and angered many dragons and they tore free of the earth and rose into the sky raining mountains down on the cities of the Seafaring Court and destroying them and their power.Since that time nearly a thousand years ago individual dragons have been encountered only rarely and usually through dream communications rather than in the flesh.Eyewitness accounts of encounters with dragons are rare and mostly ancient. The extreme circumstances of most encounters together with their ancient provenance and their embedding in legendary traditions makes the details hard to confirm but we can repeat what such accounts have described.Dragons are enormous creatures with scaly serpentine bodies varying numbers of short legs tipped with handlike claws and gigantic leathery wings. Their heads are on long sinuous necks and they have long snakelike tails tipped with spikes or scaly formations like speartips.Clans may be distinguished by colors with the members of a clan sporting similar or related colors but this is hard to confirm because of the limited number of reliable reports. Other physical attributes are similarly hard to confirm but they are consistently reported to be of enormous size one that fell to earth in struggle with other dragons was reported to have lifted its head high above a castles towers while lying on the ground essentially impossible to injure with weapons of mortal workmanship and possessed of uncanny powers. There are multiple reports of dragons breathing fire calling down lightning from the skies summoning wind fog rain and storms and bringing forth volcanic eruptions at will. Its impossible to say with certainty how much of these accounts is accurate and how much is fanciful.Specialist scholars agree that dragons when sleeping are able to manifest personae that can converse with people and even appear as wild animals spirits or people. Their dreams are also said to be able to create enchantments and other magical influences that can affect large geographic areas. Scholarly opinion is divided on how seriously to take the various legends of the power and influence of sleeping dragons but there is general agreement that at least some accounts of them are true and the power and influence of sleeping dragons in some places are thought to be real. There are several historical and legendary figures who are supposed to have gained much of their power through pacts or other relationships with sleeping dragons. Again some of these stories are thought to be true or partly true others are probably just stories.,worldbuilding,dbq3e8k,1,t5_2rd6n

Or just go to the local Undercity and do a shitton of drugs with someone with a lot of horns and see where you end up. That can be a gamble you might end up in their cult in their bed or in the gutter. Once youre invited youll most likely be spell fodder at first. Ever seen a picture of a cultist congregation? See those blokes in black robes awkwardly holding candlesticks? Thatll be you every Friday night for quite a while until someone starts telling you actual secrets. Keep yours eyes and ears open.As for your homework invest in a magic circle either inlaid silver or silver dust preferably and install it in the lowest available point.

10120376,0,t3_5ktx4d,The realm of men is currently united under a single order but army composition and tactics differ in the regional composition of each army. Each greater province is gifted a military chapter in the order and is allowed to raise a force that will be placed under the command of a caster a representative of the order. Know that most of these tactics change when BattleCasters are thrown into the fray. The proper way to fight with battle casters is to hold your ground while he does his work and hope not to be caught in his flames. Chapter Rose rose is the chapter of The Shallows a rich and fertile land full of lush forests. They have and currently do employ phalanx armies with minimal cavalry support preferring to fight defense battles where their expert archers can take up fortified positions. Rose itself is divided amongst its ranks so half of its force currently fights under the standard of The Conclave another greater province who currently employs heavy romanlike infantry that fights in the triple axis formations. Chapter Obsidian obsidian is the most recent chapter created for the greater province of The Conclave. They currently employ the triple axis with heavy support from auxiliary units. They fight in strict units with rotating fronts. They often fight with battlecasters so these tactics are rarely seen. Rangers of the Wild this chapter was created by Frosthaven separatists who sought to separate their region from the Greater Northern Province. After the separatists defeat their tactics and chapter were absorbed by the order. The rangers fight with generally nonconfrontational guerilla tactics. They allow the enemy into the harsh terrain of the north and then cut them from their supplies as they move forward. Their tactics are seen as barbaric because of the suffering of their enemies. They play a minds games with the enemy rather than facing their force with their own. During the night they will send men out to play their drums or wind instruments to keep the enemy awake and alert until they can not stay awake any longer. They will do this for days while refusing them food by slaughtering their caravan train and forcing the army to keep a tight perimeter. In field battles they usually just act as an elite forward scouting force of a conscript army. ,worldbuilding,dbqoxre,3,t5_2rd6n

Mages understand and perceive the world through magic through aether. Experienced mages went so deep into magic that they cannot even remember how the world feels without it.

So... does Hawaiian lose points for using it?In my own setting one of the predominant languages is very loosely based on an amalgamation of Hawaiian and Hindi with one of the recurring features being an okina style glottal mark between two vowel sounds.

They fight one another quite often though its pretty ritualized so people rarely get hurt so they dont object to exploitation following a confrontation so much as they object to unfair confrontation. There are fairly strict rules concerning first contacts with new species but once you meet enough to learn how to communicate they allow any entity to make use of their court system which operates like that anarchocapitalist style a bunch of competing courts system. Rights exist insofar as you exercise them. There are activist lawyer sorts who go around trying to educate people about their legal rights. The colonizing consortium who won the rights to the planet is also likely to lose said rights if they violate legal norms as far as treatment of native life. Those norms are inconsistent across the Hegemony though. Theres a species they very aggressively quarantine and glass any planets they try to expand to but thats not okay in other parts of the galaxy.They have a pretty strong environmental movement though. Its very difficult to dismantle a planet with a biosphere of some sort at least without taking steps to document whats there. Humanity is in a sort of affirmative action position there was some backlash to how first contact triggered WWIII and are carted around to all those garden worlds to set up colonies to document the wildlife.Mostly though they have no desire for empire. Theyve never believed in territorial jurisdiction so subjugating another species is only done insofar as it improves their market access.

10177419,0,t3_5lqb7m,In my opinion gods  and the domains of the gods  should be closely related to the setting and not just added in for the sake of being there.  The easiest and most fun way to decide whether a god fits in properly is to ask questions about them and flesh them out making them more than just a name and a domain.For instance why is the goddess in charge of both the sun and moon?  Is she in charge of all celestial light?  Well lets say she is so we can add stars to her domain.  Now it seems like she would be naturally worshiped by travellers navigation by constellation hunters hunting by moonlight and farmers calendars based on the sun so we can add those to her portfolio as well.If you keep doing this for the rest of the gods you may find places where their domains overlap.  This would help you decide whether you should have more or less gods if you should rework their domains etc,worldbuilding,dbxo0bj,5,t5_2rd6n

That was literally WW and WW battleship warfare firing at dots on the horizon. PostWW the ranges increased tremendously thanks to cruise missiles. BVR combat was and still is considered the norm for both air and naval engagements. Irregular warfare has changed the paradigm somewhat but in a traditional scifi fleet action context close combat is not very plausible.. In the real world horizon distance puts huge constraints on effective engagement range and is why networkcentric warfare is key to modern naval design. In space theres no horizon to hide behind and that makes it a lot harder to sneak up on the spaceship that can deliver a guided projectile against a maneuvering target hundreds of kilometers away.Naval analogies are bad.

10214340,0,t3_5m6vzg,Long sorry cosmology. What are you going to do?TLDR two factions. One that wishes to awaken an ancient god. One that wishes that doesnt happen. The whole thing rests on the shoulders of a st level Druid and his tough band of murder hobo associates who think their nifty artifact is cool because it makes travel across the world faster.If youre in the campaign and youre reading this? Yeah go on. Itll come out soon enough...I started with the concept of That which exists That which does not and change. The three most basic forces. Change is the forerunner to time the first dimension. As change did its mojo that which exists eventually moved together and created the very first smallest subatomic particle which begat the the next three dimensions as well as time the original prime material plane. It was a darned important particle. More particles developed which eventually coalesced to the first atoms and boom...youve got yourself a universe going.Our friend change is equal parts affinity and enmity. Moving to something and away from something. Those themes carry though the cosmology.So weve got this prime material going on faster and fatter until it gets big enough and splits creating a second dimension. Those grow an create more. Each time a dimension splits it creates two exact duplicates that then grow in wildly different directions. Do this infinite times and youve got infinite dimensions. Okay dimensions are out there eating up the void and the precursor to actual particlesatoms with change as the engine. Just chugging along.Dimensions however have somewhat consistent rules governing the basics so as they developed the planes began to appear. First the elemental planes but then astral ethereal and so on. All dimensions touch all planes and all planes are shared between all dimensions. So if you wanted to Harry Potter to meet Luke skywalker itd probably be on a plane of existence because thats what they both have in common. Im thinking ethereal but hey we didnt get into planar cosmology in the canon so Im making it up.Eventually the right combination of stuff got together and life was created. That popped out the spirit realm. Yep the very first primordial cell created the entire spirit realm. It was an important cell....and the moment it died the realm of death was created.So life does exactly two things. It consumes and it reproduces. It is exactly reflected like a shadow in the spirit realm. So as more and more life is created the spirit realm starts to build up all of these individual cells. Eventually the cells in the prime material came together and one day a long time ago outside of any mechanical or chemical influence contrary to pure logic the cells made a choice which created the first god. A god of creation that really was just a collective consciousness made up of all the reflections of cells in the spirit domain. Then when those cells died a dark god of destruction was created. So weve got our god of light and god of dark. The god of light quickly gains sentience and omniscience. It then begins creating. Not directly. More like poking here and there to effect certain kinds of change. The dark god reflecting destruction thereby begins destroying and returning order to entropy. So the light god creates order from entropy and the dark takes order and returns it to entropy. Eventually the light god grew so large that it split into two. Loosely regarded as his son a god of order. That made things easier. However the god split again and created a god of chaos. In the mean time the dark god had his own two sons. One of good affinitythe coming together and evil enmitythe moving apart. Over time however it was noticed that the dark gods domain grew faster and larger than the light gods. Mainly because anything that ever lived was in his domain. So the dark god gets to thinking...why am I sharing time with this light guy? Itd be better if I just ruled the whole thing...I am much bigger after all. However the light god and his two scrappy sons were able to keep the dark god at bay. Around that time the light god created a workshop that he could use to more expertly craft and build worlds. It is called the vial of time though it has no control over time for some reason. Okay more on that in a minute.Unfortunately as things go the god of chaos and the got of order got to tussling with each other and the true god said you know...itd be best if neither of them got the upper hand. So the true god created the fates to ensure they retained balance in all things.The dark gods sons also fight but because they each want to serve their father to quash the light god.So the god of chaos and the god of order are fighting and eventually order wins the day. This is actually bad because it creates weakness in the light gods defenses that allows the dark god to muck about in the domain of light.Beaten the god of chaos searches the prime material for a suitable place to die. He spots an absolutely perfect planet because it is rich with life. He crashes in and a few things happen . All life on the planet are splashed into the spirit realm creating innumerable gods. . His bones infused with magic and spirt permeate the world which creates two races. A race of order and a race of chaos. The race of order has remained unchanged for aeons. The race of chaos however has evolved to create elves humans dwarves and halflings. . His heart was embedded deep in the planet. Should a living soul human elf halfling dwarf or the race of order join with the heart he will be reborn with the soul as the father and the planet the motheregg. This destroys the planet.Okay youve got these delightful new races growing and changing around the world and who eventually discover magic. Man do they love that stuff. This becomes something of a concern for the fates because magic has its own rules and makes it difficult for the fates to know whats going on. So...the fates create the library and appointascend a librarian to take care of it. The library maintains a link to all magic across the world and across all dimensions. They didnt stop there either. They consider technology in the same light as magic as well. So this library is filled with representations of every magic item potion and scroll every staff sword and artifact across all dimensions. It also has things like machine guns laser rifles nuclear bombs computers and the like. Its a big library. The librarian can recall any object from wherever it is and give it to someone. Not something she does often but when the fates ask what are you going to do?Back to our one true god. Remember all those new gods that were created when the god of chaos death ejected the living into the spirit realm? They had a pretty good time killing each other because thats what bored supreme beings do on a Saturday night when theyre out of beer. In the ruckus the vial of time is stolen from the one true god by a friend that betrays him. The other gods the ones that remain arent happy about this and eventually take the vial break it into  parts and scatter it around the world. Boom. Make a world with that! That pretty much sets up session  for the campaign e DampD. Youve got forces that want the vial to come together so they can use it to get to the heart of the god of chaos join him and become a supreme god bye bye planet. You have others that think thats not such a good idea including the god of darkness because hes quite liking his breathing room. So the forces that want to save the world are actually aligned with the dark god.Dimensional travel a few select dimensions planar travel extra terrestrial travel travel to the spirit realm come in to play as everyone is kinda interested in keeping the dark god from getting too grabby with the light.And youve got a first level druid with the first of the  vials and the ability to activate it as well as his merry band of fellow adventurers just murder hoboing around. The artifact allows for terrestrial teleportation via portals while literally all of existence looks on...that is...they would...if they knew. They dont...yet.

10223627,0,t3_5mcgjw,I tend to think that the standard monarchy is way overdone and not nearly interesting enough but thats not to say that I dont have monarchies.I mean theres the Commonwealth which is a poorly defined government type in real life but in my world it basically is a monarchy that failed to develop a dynasty. Theres a singlechamber great council that runs the government daytoday. Anyone with a drop of nobility in them can show up and vote when its convened. Are you a penniless beggar whose grandmother was plowed by a nobleman at a bar? Congratulations you can vote. Are you the most powerful immigrant? Nope you need at least one ancestor descended from the founding hero. About  in  subjects of the crown can show up to vote. So who is king? Well if you can vote or could in theory but live in a different nation then you could be made king upon the death of the old king by simply getting the most votes a plurality not a majority and then you rule for life in a limited constitutionmonarch sort of way.The neighboring Imperial government is similar in that the Emperor is selected by a small group of empowered people. Only in this case the regional governors have to be female and the Emperor male. He is obligated to knock each and every regional governor up so that they have exactly one son. Then they do the Ottoman thing where upon his death one of the Emperors sons ascends the throne and the rest die. Its a lot like a more courtly medieval hunger games only theres a lot less running around the woods with bow and arrow and a lot more having a pretty girl from your province seduce and poison adversaries.But many more people are governed by nonmonarchies.One of the more powerful sorts of governments is the city league. Basically a city or really a town or exceptionally large village really has a council that is hereditary appointed by the guildschurchesmilitias or elected. That local government rules the city and the immediate environs of the city and sends one or three depending on the league to a central council of cities that governs trade diplomacy and war. Given that its league of middlesized cities its mostly trade. Historically this kind of government has been able to field more troops than feudal monarchies and one the Swabian League simply out classed the Holy Roman Emperor in terms of army strength. But in my world theyre far more interested in taking down robber barons basically petty nobles andor bandit chiefs who build illegal castles and collect illegal taxes tariffs and tolls from merchants than conquering.Theres also the Noble Republic. Which is more of a stillborn monarchy than a Republic as we think of it. You see instead of there being a single king no one man was able to hold the islands together but they faced regular raids and were constantly threatened with invasion. So the most powerful noble families from each of the seven island got together and appointed their second sons to a council that draws an army and a treasury from all the islands. Who leads the council rotates from island to island every year. This can lead to some fairly large swings in diplomatic attitude every few years or so making them challenging for other polities to deal with.As in real life when the empires of old shattered into thousands of pieces many of those remnants coalesced around temples or monasteries or militant religious orders. Small theocracies are slightly more common than independent duchies and citystates. Only they tend to have leaders that are unambiguously and literally appointed by the deity in question. Theres surprisingly little politics when your god physically shows up and says that guy and occasionally gives the boss man a letter telling him or her to do things.,worldbuilding,dc2wlpo,1,t5_2rd6n

When the Memory Guild needs something done be it demolition extraction assassination full frontal assault doesnt matter the Sages are skilled enough to do it. They are the last resort.They operate all around Fae Realm but specialize in venturing beyond Fae Realm into other Realms connected by Way Stones.

This generally required the memorization of some thought process which was generally forgotten after spellcasting. This is now known as Classic Magic. There was no ism or ic for this type until a new type was discovered by Archmage Iluvala a style named after him.Iluvalistic Magic is a spell that permanently changes how a humans mind can interact with the AEther. This spell turns the minds ability to pull AEther frrom the AEther present outside their own form and instead directs it inward allowing the mage to from then on be able to store mana in their own bodies and use this as a resource.Essentially its the difference between classic DampD style magic of memorizing spells to cast and newer RPGs where a character has a mana bar and can cast any spells whenever they want as long as they have the mana. Barring cooldowns if applicable.Mages that continued to practice Classical Magic made the argument that Classical is better due to being limitless  As long as you can remember a spell you wont have to worry about not having the energy to cast it. Mages that cast the spell created by Iluvala and converted Iluvalism claimed that Iluvalistic Magic was better due to being better for sudden situations.

People would carry around spools of it and snip off portions to pay for goods. Change wasnt a thing since you could snip off the exact amount you needed. Banks all had devices for fusing snipped pieces back together and the empty spools could be turned in and recycled for a small reward.Eventually this system was deemed to costly and wasteful since the refusing process was rather time consuming and so the system of coinage was rolled out to replace the old wire system once coin presses were invented.,worldbuilding,dcndpgf,5,t5_2rd6n

The problem is Gosredas lived millennia ago. Most of the worlds population can claim some ancestry of him. The Automaton is indestructible against all known spells and artifacts and will carry out any order given with neargodlike speed strength and skill. Thats the exact problem actually the first time Gosredas gave the Automaton an order the force the thing exerted on the stone floor as it ran destroyed the castle stone shattering the enchantments of the castle and unbinding the energy contained within killing everyone inside.The Automaton is currently stored inside a hermetically sealed soundproofed room in a facility entirely staffed by people with absolutely no elven ancestry with the exception of the commander who is confirmed as a descendant of Gosredas and is only permitted to speak to the Automaton if the facility is in imminent danger of destruction.,worldbuilding,dcnk0cd,1,t5_2rd6n

10438944,0,t1_dcr988p,That actually brings up an interesting point though. What if there was a world where one race or species really was superior to another in some way? Obviously the one where white people are superior to black people isnt just blatantly racist but also difficult to suspend disbelief in since any reasonably intelligent reader knows that there is no meaningful difference between white and black people. But what about a world where elves for example really are intrinsically stronger wiser more intelligent more compassionate and allaround superior to say humans? That would raise all sorts of moral questions like by whose standard are elves really superior? or do humans deserve the same treatment as elves despite their inferiority just because they are sentient? what about pigs then? where do we draw the line? This world would have all sorts of racism subjugation of humans etc. and there would be some serious moral questions as to whether it would be justified. So I suppose your point isnt so much dont address difficult moral issues with your worldbuilding but rather dont just use worldbuilding as an excuse to express your deeply immoral thoughts and opinions. But again I wonder where that line is drawn? This example is going to make me sound like much more of an asshole than the previous one but this is an extreme example that Im only using to illustrate a point what if there was a sentient species say Dwarves where the females were universally born less mentally capable than the males? Essentially every female in the species was by no choice of their own severely mentally handicapped to the extent that they could barely be considered sentient or intelligent. This sounds like some misogynistic assholes dream world where the male dwarves go around taking women as though they were pets or livestock without having to consider their stupid opinions or emotions. But if this world was real it would raise extreme moral dilemmas what are the male dwarves to do? Should they give up their existence as a species because the females are basically unable to consent to sex? Should the females be granted personhood or should they be treated like property? Are females people or are they basically just biological receptacles for reproduction? rnocontext I imagine these moral questions at some point in Dwarven society and given the right circumstances might actually result in reverence and deep respect for women not subjugation. But again by whose standard is that necessarily better?These examples push the boundaries of whats morally acceptable in worldbuilding because at first glance they really do seem like someone just trying to express their dumb moral opinions. But I think another part of it is that it really makes you the reader consider the fact that there really isnt an objective moral standard. You have to confront people who have radically different moral opinions because they live in radically different worlds elves who believe themselves to be superior and therefore more deserving of love and good treatment than humans dwarven men who own three wives but love them each as individuals despite their inability to reciprocate or even express thought. Im not saying these people are morally in the right. Im just saying that worldbuilding is a great opportunity to ask hardhitting moral questions and perhaps also make your reader consider the fact that people whose moral opinions are different from theirs are still in the end people.,worldbuilding,dcrbusd,47,t5_2rd6n

Male Vampires love to do hard drugs to make up for it or in particularly fringe covens theyll drug their victims before drinking their blood for a double high. It varies for females but as many still have sensitivity some still engage in intercourse with humans or other races rather than indulging in drugs. Fae are some of the biggest weeaboos and otaku in the underworld community its common to even see Ogres wearing shirts with their waifus or nymphs to be strolling about in full cosplay. They seem to connect to the overly dramatic display of emotion common in the medium many saying its easier for them to understand. Nephilim despite being holybound demon hunters are typically complete metalheads. The youth especially but also most of the younger adults older Nephilim are rare and have less impact on culture as a result. Because Nephilim die so often it is expected to have had your first child before  and having less than five before you turn  is considered extremely irresponsible. Nephilim who do not take well to combat training sometimes become professional parents to dead Nephilims children. ,worldbuilding,dcznkc0,5,t5_2rd6n

10522958,0,t1_dczmrqt,Just wanted to make a few points to address the conversation between uTongueTyd and ukatiekatie.First of all this isnt Earth the society and biology of these people cant be perfectly compared to any of the characteristics of humans or human culture. Yes societies on Earth tend to prefer men over women in combat. Yes women are more valuable for reproductive purposes. But I dont believe these two things are necessarily correlated. We have to be careful not to confuse biological facts with historical gender roles and symptoms of patriarchal societies. But I wont try to justify the culture of a fictional people by debating gender dynamics in our world. Instead Ill give a little background as to why it could work with the LokoniTo begin with this is a matriarchal society. The way they value men vs women is entirely different than most western cultures in our world. The men and women of the Lokoni are a product of these gender roles just as we are. For instance they consider women to be faster and more physically able than men. Therefore females are trained from a young age and encouraged to improve their skills in riding fighting etc. Also women are considered more wise than men so the women are given more intensive schooling. Its a cycle whereby they have developmental advantages because of the roles that they are thrust into.In their society men are spiritual leaders. They have important roles in the ceremonial aspects of their culture and are in charge of taking care of their family taking care of camps etc. In this way men are more valuable at home than on the battlefield.As for the why... Why is it a matriarchal society? That is a difficult question to answer. Why do we live in a patriarchal society? What are the reasons behind the few matriarchal societies that exist on Earth? To me it makes more sense in many ways to relate the power of giving birth to the power of controlling a society. Its just the way the Lokoni have developed. Its just the way they see the world.Ill also reiterate a few other points as to why a predominately female army doesnt have enough of an impact on reproduction to cause them to go extinct. Not all of the women are sent in to battle. Not all of the women sent in to battle die in battle. War is not frequent enough to damage the population size significantly. War is seen as one of several forms of population control that helps keep the balance between man and natureTo be honest I hadnt necessarily thought through all of this before this debate started. I agree that it just needs to make sense in universe but its also good to be challenged to justify your own creation. Hope this settles the debate!,worldbuilding,dd0w327,1,t5_2rd6n
10523449,0,t3_5qcom6,The Terran Empire back when it was the little fledgling Colonial Democratic Empire of West Earth about  years ago used to think funnylooking toilet roll shaped space craft with long spines running through were the state of the art. They would send a hundred of them at an attacking or opposing system drop a few nukes and maybe fire energy weapons at the poor bastards defending themselves.Now the Terran Empire has capital ships which can destroy planets QBall based weaponry which can render solar systems uninhabitable due to the risk of parts of your ship turning to antimatter they build starships capable of surviving in the photospheres of suns for fucking days their cascade weapons have been known to collapse solar systems into neutron stars and reduce black holes to hawking radiation and their alcoholic beverages have a habit of knocking out lessable drinkers. Its the last one that wins most wars.The closest thing the Terran Empires fleet holds to a light battlecruiser can change the shape of continents and blow holes in moons and their metric weaponry has been known to destroy nebulae. Plural.And they arent even the most technologically advanced in my setting.The Terrans once entered this war over a single ambassador. This fella had gotten himself captured on a planet which was capital of a patheticallysmall slowerthanlight federation. The STL federation wanted superluminal travel in return for the ambassadors safe return.Now the Terrans can do this thing where they use Hyperspace . The Bulk to pull someone out of a dangerous situation. The problem is it takes weeks of complex calculations on quantum computers no less and is damaging to the surrounding environment  especially on planets. So you can understand the donohard mentality of the Terrans getting in the way here they dont want to hurt anyone and they also dont want to give up their tech.This federation starts torturing the ambassador and broadcasting it live using the one piece of FTL tech their capital has a little communicator. The Terran Empire sees this torture and after deliberating for all of one second chooses to transfer the ambassador out. Hes injured but alive  more so from the transfer than the torture. However they realise the horrible damage theyve done  the capital city of the capital world is going to suffer air pollution and so on. So they think about this remember the awful things done to their ambassador and do you know what they did?No? Neither do I. But that capital world isnt even there any more and theres no implication that any one in the system survived unless the Terrans wanted them to.,worldbuilding,dd0y3dm,1,t5_2rd6n

Not so much in the geography but in the basis for the most fleshed out nation. I took the idea of nations segregated by bending type in AtLA and created nations of a greater amount of elemental magic types. I then changed it to one nation with provinces separated by element types and developed a central government for it. The current iteration is being developed for Fifth Edition DampD so rather than being separated by element types instead consists of eight provinces each specializing in one of the schools of DampD magic. This mageocracy has been in pretty much perpetual war with a neighboring magicsuspicious empire in my mind so I recently started thinking about how the enmity between the nations would have started. I rewound the history of the world to a point where the two nations were once one and my campaign will cover how and why the split occurs.,worldbuilding,dd1w14p,4,t5_2rd6n

10542592,0,t3_5qw12u,Like almost everything in my world  race has everything to do with it. wolves.  A house typically led  by a wolf  will usually run a resturanttavernhotel out of a section of the house building that is always closed off from the rest of the house building. These bars are good.  Food steak every variety of burger ever a food called gravy pie  beef or chicken gravy with beef or gravy usually stuff for children soup with strange parts of the meat.  If the house has some humans in it then they will usually have Italian food andor Chinese food  also  a lot of fried food. Drink Rum whiskey  beer wine soda  everything.  Bears oh  bears do love to take care of people.  The hotel ends of the tavernhotelresturant complexes  tend to be homeless shelters.  The homeless work on the service end  the family works in the kitchen. Drinks sweetened wine and champaign.  Dessert wine and Russian champaign the sweetest kind. Food baked goods. Typically sweet bread and sweets. Bears love sugar. Rabbits if you plan on going to the local mutual aid compound just to get a drink...  Its not going to happen  to people other than the delivery men  are invite only. The ones you can get into under normal circumstances  are usually in the city.  These bars are typically acceptance only if you are drunk or are being an ass you will not be let in  if you look stressed and need alcohol they will  only. Rabbit owned bars like to keep very specific clientele  not just rabbits  but usually just specific types of people.  They usually cut you off after a few drinks.  Or whenever you are visibly drunk. They dont like to have people being rowdy and throwing up. If you are looking for a rave  go elsewhere  if you are looking to talk and get some unique drinks come here.  And speaking of drinks... Drinks tea herbal tea coffee  all mixed with rare and high quality booze. However  dont be surprised when the menu has something called vine tea w booze  lets just say that vine is a plant that helps bunnies do bunny stuff.  Just look over it and dont joke about itMice if youve  ever seen a mouse.  It was in a compassion society.  These mice are kept persistently happy so no bars. But if a mouse offers you the stuff that they keep to keep then happy.  Take it and check out at the volunteer check out  go home have fun at home.

But I would love to see more fantasy worlds on this sub that include wide spread usage of firearms. A tendency that I noticed and I am sure I am not the first one to do so is that when firearms are included in a fantasy they are often shown to be still in primitive state so that they dont threaten all the sword and melee action seemingly due to belief that if guns are allowed to advance they might kill all the tension because the main character can just shoot the bad guy from far away which I find to be rather silly.In my setting firearms and cannons are generally omnipresent but as I mentioned before my own lack of knowledge on the topic generally limits the information about the too they exist and they probably use wheellock mechanism except for those times when I a tempted to introduce repeating firearms.,worldbuilding,dd4p0i8,5,t5_2rd6n

The way magic works is becoming aware of your place in the story.The Sower  Wanted to make a Fantasy world and in particular someday a Fantasy WRPG game where the focus isnt on combat and there is very few actual onscreen fights. Although there is implied assassination Wanted to create a Fantasy setting with magic and mystical elements that looks on how it impacts everyday lives rather than a chosen hero that goes off on an adventure and how often times being special means being abused and abusing others At the same time in many way. For the game angle I want to make a noncombat game that feels like a AAA title and flesh out diplomacy and social interaction systems to make them more dynamic and interactive and not just an excuse to get good or bad karma points.Unnamed Sci Fi  Avoid Sci Fantasy tropes like The Force. Avoid FTL technology and handwaving explanations show the effects of long time period space travel.

Sea clouds are also hunted by humans for food. While their bodies mostly consist of helium sacs their tentacles are considered delicacies.

I can understand them as a sort of secondary antagonist to both the positive force and the negative but it seems unnecessary. If anything it would rapidly become the default state of the universe  assuming positive and negative are roughly balanced and also working against one another if they had to strain against an equally powerful force preventing change in either direction the universe would be stagnant from the getgo. The original Titans were the first pantheon of gods in Greek mythology cast down and replaced by the new gods under Zeuss leadership. It sounds like youre leaning more towards the idea of them either being first among creatures or ascended mortals however. If you go that direction I would combine it with your mortal champions The first ChampionsTitans were the original humanoid more or less creatures immortal and legend. They rarely act directly anymore though they can still be found however their actions and liaisons in the world over the millennia have led to bloodlines of varying purity that stem from them giving rise to heroic figures. I think in terms of writing compelling narrative that the overgods idea just doesnt have a hook. Elder titans competing sporting fueding and pushing around kingdoms and continents for their loves and wars creates a dynamic world where heroes can rise and fall with a dramatic backdrop. Watching the progeny of titans rise or fall to the challenges of their bloodlines or seeing mortals with no titan blood attempt to spit in the face of selfdeclared gods is compelling on its face and doesnt really need another layer.,worldbuilding,dd7csdp,2,t5_2rd6n

And my favourite thing was choosing some exotic nation like Vietnam or Timbuktu and read all history of it  from begining to modernity.Also  one thing  this text is about commercial worldbuilding. From buyer perspective argue from  years ago between king X and member of his court is not important or maybe even fact that  years elier was important war that dont affect action at all do knowledge of history of  years war needed to enjoy movie about DDay? From buyer point of view it is just informational noise that have only mass but dont add features. But if we go for hobbyst worldbuilding? We dont care how much boring data we put into out worlds  because we like it anyway. Tolkien worldbuild as plumbing for his languages. Hell  show me one worldbuildier who dont do this for singular concepts from heavy linguistic realistic work of Tolkien with all conlang geekiness and sweat to sheer rule of cool justifing robots riding dragons and fighting alien ghosts.

When they arent in an impeccably naturallooking human form their bodies are tall and lanky  and faceless with a slimy sheen to their semitranslucent grey skin. They plague the human lands feeding off of the despair and paranoia they sow amongst human populations  and to add to all of that they are often extremely powerful in another discipline of Raw Magic Light darkness fire earth wind water and nature. In fact theyre such a big threat to the humans and the Queens that areas of highimportance often have powerful mages stationed along their perimeter who probe anyone who comes too close with their magic the only assured way of telling an Esheri from a human.No one knows where the Esheri came from who created them or how long theyve existed. The earliest human scriptures describe raids performed on small settlements by the Faceless Ones so it is assumed that the Esheri have always been a problem amongst humans. It is theorised that in the making of the world the Esheri slipped through a gap in reality  ancient beings who had been imprisoned by the gods to hold them back from the mortal world but they escaped.The Esheri are a massive problem humanity faces  the fact they cant die off of disease or old age is also not particularly helpful either.,worldbuilding,ddcxmor,1,t5_2rd6n

If its a fantasy story set in the modern period Im doubly critical of it.Ive been having difficulty categorizing the book Ive been writing because while Ive seen multiple pretty similar definitions of urban fantasy theres been only one thats broad enough that I feel my book would fall under that definition. A couple weeks ago I inquired about a book like mine but it doesnt seem like there are any well known books like it.

From a sheer original content standpoint Aeona is by far more detailed than my Porcelain Huntress setting. That said the PH setting is an alt history Earth with magic so I while Im not creating anywhere near as much original content I am having to do a HELL OF A LOT of research.  For example because the story takes place in the summer of  I have a cheat sheet of s slang  popular bandsTV shows  prices and brands foods current events and so forth that I have to weave in without making a mistake.  Since my target audience was alive when and where the novel takes place I can be and have been called out in a second if I am wrong.  For example I set the time in the first chapter by having Reagan on the radio as the Republican Nominee giving his are we better off than we were four years ago speech modified to talk about shapeshifter crime and the communist vampire threat instead of racial crime a brand new Pac Man arcade machine is in the bar The Empire Strikes Back is in  theaters ect.

10741056,0,t1_ddnd5fj,Cool stuff my dude!First and foremost know that its really awesome that youre making your own images like that and no amount of feedback or criticism takes away from that. Also I have no idea what your process is or what software you use so parse through this for whatevers the most useful First thing that stands out to me is the uniformity of the buildings you may want to consider adding even just small differences between them not only for your own reference but so that the town as a whole starts to take on some character. Heres a image of a town I did that looks to be of similar size to yours to illustrate what Im talking about.  Color! Nonnatural coloring can often be useful on maps to more easily delineate whats going on where for quick viewing but in some cases it can be overpowering. Consider using color more to direct us to where the most important information in an area is. Theres nothing wrong with having brightly colored grass but in this instance its too distracting from whats of most interest in your map which is the buildings and their arrangement. One thing I try to do as Im working on adding flavor or additional layers of detail to an area is to think of all of the real world implications of what a family or settlement would need. For example your settlement here looks very peaceful without their need for a guard post walls etc. What kind of defenses might they considered having constructed in addition to their homes? Why does this settlement in particular exist in this exact location? Where do the people gather what are their customs and what do they do to survive there or make a living? Answering these questions and considering how those might have visual representations are how I most easily arrive at flavoradding decisions.Im certainly no master but feel free to pm me if you have any followup questions ,worldbuilding,ddnuxda,5,t5_2rd6n

Well here at least God knows what theyve been doing billions of light years away on Earth.

10776759,0,t3_5u33mq,The origin of Earth in its current state would be quite the revelation. Every intelligent species has some form of creation myth relating to the Sundering and what it was. But most fall short. The basic myth goes like this The ancestors live lives of excess and the gods gathered their might to smite and start the world anew. Alas one god stepped forward to stop Armageddon and said they should change the world rather than destroy it. The gods agreed and pour their power into a great weapon that sundered the world creating it in its current state. And it is through the grace of these gods that the people live today.When in reality around the turn of the next century  humanity detected a vessel coming from beyond the Oort cloud on a direct course to earth and it was decelerating. The vessel was broadcasting a signal for all intelligent life to leave the third planet of the system as it was sovereign territory of the Vorkul Empire and it was to be terraformed. Humanity lived the next  years of the vessels approach trying to stop the vessel while doing everything in its collective power to keep the species alive. National borders fell as a single government came to power. Massive habitats were built in orbit bases built on the moon even a colony was set up on Mars. The earth itself had thousands of shelters built. Massive underground towns able to support themselves. Still on the day the vessel entered orbit less than  of the world population was either off planet of in shelters. One final warning was broadcast before the vessel started launching thousands of landers to the planet and projecting a massive energy field over the planet. As this feild closed the vessel pulsed with with energy as it began to collapse on itself. The energy field seemed to pulse with a red light before it rapidly brightened. The Earth glowed like a miniature sun for seven days then suddenly the light extinguished. The planet that was left behind was not the one people in the habitats remembered. No ice caps the continents had changed everything was green and massive weathers systems covered the planet it looked truly alien. The vessels mission was to sear the planet of all life then open its landers to spread alien DNA and viruses to expedite mutation. After this was accomplished it was to wrap the planet in an energy field and artificially speed up local time using negative mass fields. The wrench in this mission was the humans that stayed on planet. Instead of a clean slate for the prepared evolution the planet had pockets of humans animal and plants that weird effected by the alien evolution virus and DNA. The vessel sped up local time by just over  million years. Leading to the continental drift and the abundance of NeoHuman races that cover the planet. For the observers in the habitats it is only the th day. For those on the planet entire biomes and intelligent species have evolved. TLDR The people of my world live in a low fantasy world thinking they were created by gods. Actually created by alien terraforming tech than ran the humans out of hearth and home.,worldbuilding,ddrjmpo,1,t5_2rd6n

10791479,0,t3_5uc3w0,The Cult of Legion is made up of reapers who kidnap and torture other reapers until they join the cult. Reapers are unkillable so the indoctrinators can get pretty creative.First of all the captured reapers are stuck in densely packed small rooms in the cults temples the walls of which are made out of rose quartz. Rose quartz is used because the reapers as a whole were cursed upon creation through a deal between their creator and another similar entity who was creating another race. When they touch rose quartz it causes intense pain and causes a severe burning sensation. Just looking at rose quartz makes their eyes burn like acid. This is just about their only weakness and the only thing that can harm more experienced reapers.The indoctrinators regularly check up on their captives and torture them with all manners of torture implements made out of rose quartz. Seeing as reapers cant die they can go much further than normal torture. Some methods include driving a series of long rose quartz wedges into the body to slowly slice them like a fruit wrapping them in quartz tipped barbed wire and using a pulley system to constantly tighten it repeatedly stabbing and twisting with hookedbarbed rose quartz knives and crushing them with large blocks of rose quartz sometimes with added spikes like an iron maiden.

They did not age and could not die but still after countless ages at their post they grew weary and begged the gods to let them die as did all other beings. Nadwin the Singer loved his creations and did not wish to see them end but Sindal the Dancer heard their pleas and did not wish for them to suffer. The Children were allowed to pass from the living world to the Lands of Rest to have children of their own that would know the agony of death but not the suffering of eternal watchfulness. Nadwin sang a new gift for them that they could pass between the worlds as they wished taking the form of any of their beloved creatures of the earth. So they became An stealan the Changing and An menahan the Beloved. They have continued to watch over the earth protecting its peoples but resting when they need. Folk of ancient Sovdu believed in them as a kind of angel messengers and protectors and there were many tales and legends of their appearing to heroes and common folk alike. Even into the modern era many have faith in the patronage of a Beloved One and see omens in the behavior of animals they believe to watching out for them.

Heavy usually focuses on grappling breaking bones haymakers and other hard hitting attacks like upper cuts and knees. Its slow but when a hit lands you will feel it to your bones. Amp it with Augmentations it can and will shatter bones.Light is a more Defence oriented one focusing on dodging and countering Attacks with precision strikes to important parts of the body such as throat back of knees underarms and face.

They at first were made to instill public order within the government using a nonhuman entity that acts as the secondary president within the military. They called him Eon and he led his country into greatness. Eventually peoples fears of AI becoming the death bringer to the human race subsided and Eon used his army to quench any threat to his country...until he caught a super virus but he didnt know until the damage was already done.This virus apparently came from no source and Eon started to build a totalitarian government within his country and threatened war on the world for a greater challenge to his country. Of course no one wanted to do that so he led a team of bandits criminals and other deplorable androids to be his team. They called themselves Tangents.Later on the nation had its borders closed and Eon waged a war on its citizens. This is where the protagonist Exe comes in. Aside from his special creation androids that were built for war were mass produced in underground factories to ensure that Eon would not find them as quickly.

10841519,0,t1_ddxns9g,Ah a quality shitpost.Its interesting that you took the time to go into this much detail on a rather mundane aspect of your world. Since you went the extra mile Ill do my best to respond appropriately.I can see some problems with this system. If all toilets have to be built over these tunnels you have to have a tunnel going under every building. A quick look at your FSK map shows many lots with no sewer access. You either need a lot more tunnels or you need each property to overlap the tunnel line at some point. Also what do you do about multistory buildings? Solid waste needs to fall more or less straight down so you cant stack toilets on top of one another which means you have at least one toilet zone of space reserved in every building. This gets worse the higher your buildings go.Public health the Ubend water trap inside a modern toilet keeps out more than bad smells. Those gases are quite toxic. Having open holes from sewers into closed buildings is actually quite a health concern. Its not a big deal when you are dealing with an outhouse but in a crowded indoor area you are going to make people sick.Water conservation You seem to have enough water for open public fountains and enough rainfall to sustain large trees. Given this it seems questionable that you would have to go to these extreme measures to conserve water. IRL most human water use is for irrigation anyway not toilet flushing. Also given the high cost of employing a network of public pooperscoopers at all times is it really cost effective to use these instead of the simple modern flush system?If efficiency is the goal and outhouses are out due to the crowded urban setting then composting toilets are a viable option. There are larger versions that can serve public buildings as well. Maybe your shit takers are actually just like garbage men that come by weekly to pick up a bucket of semicomposted solid waste from each building.Not a pleasant job. Mike Rowe would probably still come by to film an episode of Dirty Jobs about it if film is still a thing in your world.,worldbuilding,ddy85en,2,t5_2rd6n

I repliedThis is where it can get to be a little convoluted.In our universe say there are two observers watching an event. It is possible that neither observer can agree on How long the event takes place The order of the sequence of events within that larger event The distance between variables in that eventWhat they do agree on however is how much time takes place between two larger events. This is known as the spacetime differential.Put simply Our scientists are confident that neither space nor time are real but what is definitely real is causality.How this relates to the Nao The components of their language are causally linked across space and time. So while one Nao may read a certain sentence backward from the perspective of another Nao the causal relationship between the words in that sentence is correct and so the magic still works as intended.,worldbuilding,ddzc49w,2,t5_2rd6n

10944547,0,t3_5wbh18,Ooh good timing  I just wrote this one out!So somewhere around the s the UNHA started looking for a new tank to fill out its armored vehicle ranks with. The previous model had really reached the end of its useful life  it couldnt accommodate a larger main gun without a serious overhaul and any more armor would have pushed the chassis past its limit.Furthermore a whole host of various vehicle designs had sprung up  everything from rocket artillery carriers to armored VIP transports  using unique chassis and while there was some good reasons for this it was starting to get out of hand. So they also decide hey  well simplify our ranks too and use this new tank to launch a common chassis and components program.So they go about the design process put a new vehicle together build some prototypes test them successfully and start production.And then the first production models roll off the assembly line.And theyre a disaster. Although the armor was quite sufficient against current antitank weapons postproduction testing with theoretical examples of nextgeneration antiarmor weapons shows it isnt at all enough. Just add more? There goes the weight savings you got from your redesign. The newmodel supercapacitors meant for the weapons had a nasty habit of totally failing after extended use and the vehicle was too small to fit spares or oldermodel capacitors. Fewer old capacitors could be used but that left it unable to properly use its more powerful main gun. Worst of all it was thought that giving the whole crew neural controllers meant secondary controls could be removed and space reduced. Nope turns out theres still very much a need for manual backups and room to move around. Maintenance would have been a nightmare.So the tank is basically a nonimprovement. This is a big scandal because governmentmilitary transparency is a huge deal in the UNHA and its a serious problem that these mistakes were allowed to get not just to a prototype but into production. Most designs of all vehicles and weapons go through a robust crosschecking system.But the tank cant be cancelled. Other new vehicles had been dropped on the expectation that a new universal chassis would arrive. And every day that goes by more flawed examples are rolling off production lines.Quite a few heads rolled as a result of this and led to a revision of not just the tanks design but a postdevelopment overhaul of the bureaus responsible for the mistakes.,worldbuilding,de8updk,8,t5_2rd6n

Make the most powerful witches and necromancers.Ghouls and werewolves  Vampires lack numbers so to bolster their armies they developed a plague that turns humans in degenerate but easily controlled monsters. The first stage of the plague involves a lot of screaming and bleeding out of every orifice of your body as well as extreme hair and weight loss. In the second stage the victim has lost most semblance of their humanity turning into unintelligent bestial carrion feeders. The third stage makes people even more animalistic warping them into a disgusting monster that looks something like an upright skinless dog. Being bit by one of these creatures or even being in contact with their blood tends to be enough to transmit the plague to you. And as a plague strains have managed to survive dormant in the wild so occasionally local outbreaks will pop up and wipe out entire towns.,worldbuilding,dea74np,3,t5_2rd6n

Because more is always better or worse in this case.This can either be done by making them a pack hunter or if you want a literal army of them and have any sort of cohesion between them then you need a hivemind. After all their less scary if it really is just a dumb horde of animals. That can be dealt with.I feel you can see this with the Alien movies. The original was a parasite with many eggs but not neccesarily a hive based animal but then in Aliens they wanted more of them in one setting. They could either make it a pack hunter or if they wanted LOTS of them a hive. It wouldnt work any other way.,worldbuilding,deafjjs,9,t5_2rd6n

Though if you arent up to misdeeds or something of the sort then I wouldnt count on it. However when she does sway the odds in your favour its often in a spectacular fashion. If gambling is involved then a few accusations of cheating may come your way.Sickness Vellen the Goddess of Mercy is the often more than happy to heal the sick and ill though in doing so she will require an oath of servitude to the school doctoring and of pacifism. Some races will never pray to her simply because of this requirement.Power As altering the fate of civilisations and the races is strictly taboo among the Gods if you have any intention of using this power for grand schemes then you will simply be ignored. On a smaller scale say a fight there are numerous Gods one could pray to. Willder Loma Atti Nyv or Rili. However in the case of Willder and Atti you will have to know the language in which to speak them. That language is also sacred to the Tehmn race. So make sure none are around to hear it.Fertility This depends on what race you are. If youre Human you will pray to Dala your patron Goddess and the Goddess of Love. Being the lovely Goddess she is expect triplets or maybe even quadruplets. Of course this is only in the case that you have lived a simple life of compassion and love. Other races have much less luck as family and love are far less central values. Ursu is the natural Goddess of Fertility but is much less giving and likely to only answer a Tehm. A tribute of a powerful beast will greatly improve the chance of blessing as it proves to her you are worthy of continuing your blood.Harvest Ursu happens to be the Goddess of Harvest too though only to the agricultural societies Humans Fyrans and the Didis as the first race The Tehm were not. In her opinion she made the fertile lands and if youre too inexperienced to find andor farm them then thats your problem. Doesnt stop people from praying nonetheless.Strength As the Goddess of Order Nyv stands against all forms of corruption evil and injustice. Big and small. Although Gods very rarely reveal themselves to mortals even in dire circumstances. Nyv tends to leave small matters to her child Ulvanes the God of Art. Because of this messages guidance and epiphanies come through as the form of inspired art. More desperate situations could inspire you to pilgrimage to one of the few Courts in Roviness Nyvs homeland where you will find her warriors of justice the Rovally. In the most dire of situations slaughter bloodshed and war the Rovally will intervene whether that be combat or negotiations.Protection No God will offer you outright protection. Simple as that. That said it is common to pray to Shih God of the Sun for a long day in which to travel. There are more practical options. You can buy protection from plenty of Vatok Fyrans. Or perhaps you could earn it through competition with a Tehm. Though if youre human youre unlikely to be able to afford or earn either. Enlightent The Limaril welcome all who wish to seek wisdom and enlightenment within the arms of their Goddess Tida the Goddess of Wisdom. Pilgrimage to a Library in Mirilip will bring you shelter and safe haven if you intend to pray and worship. The only requirements to stay is devotion of yourself to a field of study. Of course no one will hold you to that oath. Wisdom and enlightenment are yours to find wherever you please.Revenge Although no God dedicates themselves to revenge Loma desires the most to witness dark misdeeds. Once again in the most spectacular fashions. Although when the spectacle is over theres a chance shell out you just to see what happens.Companions Humans and The Tehm are really the only races to keep familiars or companions. Tehmn familiars are tied to their bloodline and God. Humans find companionship with the Roen a creature somewhere between a horse and dog. One might pray to Hveti Goddess of Roen for their Roen to grow strong and loyal.That about sums it up.,worldbuilding,deave2u,1,t5_2rd6n

It is the most powerful weapon humanity has ever devised blending magic and sorcery and technology and life in the most gruesome yet perfect union thought possible.  An Armored Train is defined as a human body artificially enhanced and preserved and filled with electrified ichor so that its magical ability becomes so strong that a fragment of God is unlocked inside elevating it to the power of an Angel and evolving its natural magic ability to its ultimate potential.  Of course nothing in the definition says it has to actually be a train  almost a quarter of Armored Trains were not actual trains  but the design necessitates a power system so large that only a train would be able to transport the whole thing on land and theyre usually given armor.  Usually it takes the form of a cybernetic humanoid torso with a single head with a lower body attached to the ichor pumps and the power system.  The human inside is normally already dead and its muscle tissue replaced with whale muscle or synthetic fibers so it can be easily replaced.  The end result is very large extremely powerful in sorcery and with a magical power that changes the dynamic of war.Several Armored Trains have been built over history but since their immense power makes them highpriority targets they dont typically last long.  They includeWorld War IIATMillipede Soviet Union  Albin Kowalski  The first Armored Train deployed in combat creates future scenarios from sets of variables to test the outcomes of actions in order to predict possible futures in the short and long termATIsopod British Empire  Albin Kowalski  Alters global weather patternsATHarvestman British Empire  Albin Kowalski  Causes all lifeforms in a certain radius to rot to death designed to fight against ATScorpionATScorpion Nazi Germany  Albert Speer  The largest Armored Train of World War II warps the magnetic core of the planet to alter and accelerate tectonic activity.  This project was heavily interfered with by Hitler who demanded several features be added on notably its copious size its massive shouldermounted artillery cannon and its detachable titanium gauntlets.ATWidow United States  J. Robert Oppenheimer  An airplanemounted Armored Train which charges its batteries and powers itself using lightning rods and flying through lightning storms.  Alters the gravity of the moon to induce tsunamis.  Designed to target Japan.  Ironically defeated by teleporting to the moon.Cold WarATTarantula United States  Projects impassible force barrier domes over large areas built to combat Soviet Armored TrainsATLobster Soviet Union  Freezes time built to combat American Armored TrainsATRecluse United States  Atlas  Creates false radio radar and sonar signals designed to prompt an Armored Train war with the Soviet Union but never fully activated.

Plus Im pretty sure that each hemisphere experiencing the seasons out of sync further complicates things.But your world doesnt have ice caps or hemispheres. The advantage of that is that modelling sunrelated climate is very simple seasons occur everywhere at once not taking into account smaller more local weather patterns.The disadvantage of this difference between Earth and your world is that Earth is no longer a reliable predictor of your worlds climate. However there are a few spots you can look at on Earth to get a rough indicator of what your worlds climate might be like.Your sunlight comes down directly overhead so our best bet would be to look close to the equator and around the Tropics of Capricorn and Cancer. These are where the sun spends most of its time shining directly down on. Central and South America Africa the Arabian Peninsula India northern Australia and the islands of the South Pacific are the places to look at.But even those are incredibly varied which goes to show that in your world aside from the overall seasons local factors like geography and water presence are going to be the factors that make local climates varied and interesting.,worldbuilding,decqmbn,1,t5_2rd6n

He also has the raw strength and speed to take out entire spacecraft on his own even large Battleships and Dreadnoughts aided by the fact that he can phase through the vast majority of energy shields used in the setting. Oh and completely destroying his body isnt enough to kill him. There is a way to temporarily put him out of commission but even that requires a lot of things to go right for his opponents.

Governments are bad enough at dealing with superhumans that their only defense against a dedicated villain is a few unregulated superheroes the heroes that do come about just happen to fall into it without realizing it even when superheroes have existed for a while before they ever got into the business and they would clearly have had to consider it as an option at some point and the villains that do exist always have the same sort of weirdly foilable plans.

They used to create new universes Planes and destroy them in the Multiverse unconsciously and by accident. Theyre like ultimate magical eldritch horrors they simply werent even aware of us. They had children called Primogenitors that were three dimensional beings of still super high power but as they were three dimensional beings they hated their parents the Primordials and helped mortals defeat them. Its more complex than that and there was a certain Primordial that took interest in Mortals and took on a specific mortal as his pupil. He taught this mortal the first magic and gave him a book that had infinite pages all about different magics some still not even known and some so powerful it defies what we know about magic currently. Anyways this mortal uses this book to create prisons for the Primordials prisons called the Aleph Stones that had inverted infinite dimensions and aura they acted as a negative infinity to the infinity of the Primordials effectively canceling them out. If the Primordials ever get freed the Multiverse will be basically erased as they take their instant revenge. Theres also the aforementioned Primogenitors which are basically the highest tier beings in the Multiverse. There are eight of them and they gave birth to all gods under them.

Normally Deltans are a physically superior race that unfortunately has a very primitive culture. Although they live in tribal clans and use swords instead of guns their physiology is vastly impressive in comparison to Humans and Kronians. Deltans are typically agile and strong have skin thats invulnerable to bullets and are immune to toxins to the point of going to extreme lengths in order to get drunk.Normally Deltans behave like humans although they place a great deal of attention to strength and honesty. However theres a subspecies of the Deltans that have been the subject of much debate The Omegas. It is unknown if they are the next step in Deltan evolution Deltans reduced to madness or even a different race entirely. What is known though is that they are not only stronger than Deltans but they are filled with so much rage that would murder nonhumans at a moments notice. Humans feel safe around Deltans because despite their strength and fighting abilities they are sociable and know when to hold back. Omegas on the other hand only know one level of confrontation kill or be killed. Omegas will not hold back strike to knock out or even play by rules of confrontation. They will tear limbs off rip open stomachs and smash bodies onto rocks until it has been reduced to a gory mess. Only the most armored military vehicles are safe as Omegas will surround a car en masse and try to rip it open in order to grab the drivers. Unless you could catch one by surprise or have a line of plasmafueled gunmen at the ready attacking even a single Omega is just plain suicide because the only thing worse than one Omega is an entire horde which can go into a ragefueled frenzy and rush in as high as . Frenzies although extremely rare are able to eliminate the inhabitants of an occupied fort in a matter of hours.Despite the danger they pose the human and Kronian governments will not exterminate Omegas due to a deal with the Deltan tribes for the usage of their planet.

11043765,0,t3_5xoxff,I asked this question a while ago and got some cool responses...As for my world it changed around the year  BC when the dwarf planet Ceres was knocked out of orbit and threatened to collide with Earth. An ancient precursor race chose to save humanity and created a machine to deflect the incoming asteroid. The machine worked but the fallout of celestial energy from the machine caused humans as well as other flora and fauna to slowly evolve the ability to harness that energy. Over time humans and creatures began to develop abilities that would be impossible in our timeline.  Many of mankinds myths and legends became facts and the future was changed forever.,worldbuilding,dejsi4n,8,t5_2rd6n
11044352,0,t3_5xoiz3,Like many have said here just do what feels right as long as youre not blatantly bashing the groups that arent represented. That said there are a few things I think would be helpful to keep in mind. I dont know anything about your world but there are a lot of characters in fiction whose sexuality never has to come up. Even if the romance andor sex in shown in the story is all heterosexual its not like youre going to explicitly tell the audience that every character is cis and straight. . Even if someone critiques your work for not involving nonbinary characters that doesnt necessarily mean that they dont like the work as a whole. As someone whos ethnically South Asian for example I enjoy the works of Tolkien and C.S. Lewis even though I might critique the depiction of the Haradrim and Calormenes although yes I am aware of Sams internal monologue about the Haradrim.. You obviously dont have to change any of your preestablished characters sexes genders or sexualities nor do you have to go out of your way to include characters who are diverse in these areas as someone who does try to do so I know it can be a little challenging. But when you come up with a character in the future Id suggest just taking a second to consider whether being nonstraight noncis or nonbinary would add to their character or their story.,worldbuilding,dejuwcj,3,t5_2rd6n

11053842,0,t3_5xrt3i,Family structures in Gharag are typically not nuclear particularly in the lower class. This will require some brief backgroundIn what is ostensibly an effort to assist the poor mining syndicates offer working holidays for jobless men with a wife and child to provide for whereby they live in company towns outside the city and mine for a few months. Food and shelter are provided by the company and theyll send a stipend to your family back home. This has its own problems but thats a story for another time. The point is that a large percentage of the poor men in Gharag will be out of their homes for months at a time. Now youre all caught up!The lower class within the city walls then is mostly made up of women and children. Many families may live in the same home or strip of homes. Resources are pooled. Childrearing is something of a community effort. This has the effect of diluting the distinction between blood relatives and close neighbors. For all intents and purposes every child has  or  mothers and many siblings.The mining companies who each control different districts within the city wholeheartedly endorse this phenomenon. If families put down roots and bond with the neighbors their kids will likely start their own families nearby and produce more workers. You can only sign up to work for the company whose district you live in.Young men are incentivized to start a family ASAP because that means they can take advantage of the mining contracts mentioned before and bring money into their community. ,worldbuilding,dekxn6k,2,t5_2rd6n

EmagTech uses those as ammunition think laser cartridges from various scifi settings and to create great effects with small rifts.,worldbuilding,dembtau,16,t5_2rd6n

11085834,0,t3_5yazr8,In LoreThey are named for their piglike greed and hawklike aggression.PigHawks are large raptors that feed on smaller animals and insects. They are omnivorous and will eat grain and vegetables as well but they require at least a small amount of meat in their diets to survive. They are flightless with no wings moving quickly on powerful legs tipped with razorsharp talons. They are known to dig moles and shrews out of the ground and use their teeth to tear termite colonies apart. They will even enter shallow waters to feed on minnows but this must be done carefully because they are unable to swim.Male pighawks are called roosters and are larger than females with feathers on their ankles and bright red heads. Females have dull browncolored heads. Pighawks are usually white or brown with black markings. Rarely they may be one solid color.UTILITYThese are aggressive and potentially dangerous animals with sharp talons and a hard beak full of pointed teeth. Though they have a lot of meat humans and most humansized races dont farm them because they are simply too big and dangerous to handle. They are widely farmed by larger races like minotaurs roshava and ogres.There are several benefits to farming pighawks over chickens. They yield far more meat per animal than a chicken they are easier to contain since they cannot fly and they can even defend themselves from predators like weasels foxes and most other birds of prey.The biggest drawback is that they require meat so feeding them can be a bit more complicated than simply scattering grain. Pighawk farmers typically feed each individual one rat every couple of days. If the pighawks go too long without meat they will begin to cannibalize eachother and attack their farmers.Hens will lay eggs just as chickens do but these eggs are four times as large and black in color. The shells are thicker and harder to crack which makes them more portable. Though theyre said to taste bad these eggs are full of nutrition that many peoples rely on.,worldbuilding,deokiek,29,t5_2rd6n

Under the Royalty is the exalted PrinceBishops. They control and minister to their flock within their grand duchies. Under them controlling small territories outside the duchies are Domains the supreme Lords of Old. These lords control legions of knights and wizards. All ready for battle. Inside of the duchies lay Baronies Counties earldoms and many other lavish titles. Under them are Knights and the Gentry. Usually powerful spellswords or faecontracted sword singers. Under them are the Freeman. These Magically trained men and women make up the bulk of the imperium. They go into countless jobs after training and serve in the armed forces. Under the Freemen are the surfs. The lower class still magically trained but not cant travel from territory to territory. Under the Serfs are the FaeBeast slaves.

Their surface is more of a sticky liquid than it is wood which allows it to trap insects and consume them for the extra nutrients they need in their wasted landscapes....Is this allowed? The link there leads to a post I made in the worlds subreddit which presents the image and then more information about the trees. The image isnt the primary thing being presented here since my comment is just text with an optional link in case one also wants to see a visual and some extra context. Should I have the link just lead to the image on Beeples website? My intention when it came to prompt responses for Yalldve was to include a short line at the end of themYalldve is a collaborative worldbuilding project based entirely on Beeple art.

They are only found in the deepest parts of the ocean near volcanic fissures. Prior to finding a method to stabilize them they were impossible to bring back from the depths. As the Kahvi neared their home the crystals would simply vanish. But the process to stabilize them is imperfect. There is fine balance that is needed to form the useable crystal. Too much and the magic is neutralized leaving you with a really expensive rock. Too little and only the outer layer will solidify. This has varying results ranging from a beautiful but useless glasslike husk where the magic simply escaped to creating a catastrophic explosion from what is essentially a magical time bomb with an unknown time to detonation. The process requires a whole crew with specialized equipment and is performed where the crystals are harvested. ,worldbuilding,df452rm,1,t5_2rd6n

Lowerranking priests dont legally have political authority but in practice they and the Church in general have a great deal of influence over the nobility.The king heads the College of Augury which is the secondhighest ecclesiastical authority and appoints its members from lower ranks of priests. Tradition dictates that the members of the College should not have any priorexisting land holdings and this is adhered to with one major exception The king usually grants his eldest son or his heir if he is childless a seat in the College. However it is not uncommon for members of the College without holdings from Church land to obtain secular land rights after their appointment.The College appoints a new Pontiff and therefore King from their membership when the old one dies. It is expected that the old kings heir be appointed to the position but it is not unheard of for the College to occasionally decide in favor of another of their number.The secular power structure is largely determined by land ownership and the wealth of particular holdings and nominally independent of the Church.Men and women do hold different daytoday roles in that men hold most of the authoritative but not all and scholarship positions while women hold a larger proportion of the charitable and active work positions. That said though there is precedent for women serving as high as the College of Augury and several widowed queens have served as regents.working title,worldbuilding,df4eix6,1,t5_2rd6n

Mesvenik granted the company a trade monopoly within Makland a cool temperate region consisting of many small to medium sized islands rich with silver exotic furs and Torkm an ivorylike substance found on tusks of several animals inhabiting the region. The territory also comprises a portion of the main landmass of Aostrohelms however only the coastal regions are inhabited.Though MSTC officials had to take an oath of loyalty to the Republic the company was practically its own nation having its owned armed forces treaties and other administrative functions independent of the Mesvenik government.

If were talking Star Wars esque then youd be fine to have feudal lords and what not though a sort of Republic might end up being more appealing to the human population at the very least. Feudalism was unpopular among the serfs who were often prone to rebellions. Republics like the U.S. have for the most part remained stable and prosperous into the common era where as feudalism died out almost entirely before the turn of the th century. In a physics heavy universe you start running into relativity problems people being too far away to have any meaningful contact with one another. Civilizations and empires would be cloistered to their star systems and little else. When the communication lag begins approaching magnitudes of months we start having problems. Interstellar civilizations could experience such lag in orders decades if not more. Unless people became a lot longer lived and lived life at a pace slower than we currently do now then feudalism would be ineffective if not impossible outright. ,worldbuilding,dfa1w4m,1,t5_2rd6n

The downside is the bloodlust they endure erodes their sanity and they must either permanently purge themselves of the beast blood or face the everincreasing risk of turning into a mosnter and never turning backregaining humanity.Mancers amp Channelers  Humans who erupt a magical power unique to them which can also be enchanted into items. Channelers take this a step further by calling on the powers of all nearby mancers and channelers and combining their powers. Both have slightly enhanced strength stamina and agility as well as lengthened lifespansyouthfulness. Mancers live  times longer channelers live almost  times longer.Strongest IndividualsAll my storys protagonists by the end  A lazy answer but there are very few characters who are truly powerful that arent in one of the above two groups. Although they are all powerful sometimes in similar and sometimes in different ways. Ivan is a highly trained channeler a skilled swordsman and rather handsome. Even for a mere human his endurance is absolutely astounding. Artur is such a powerful mancer than he is comparable to a channeler in magical power. And damn is he good at kung fu. Phyllis is a mighty spellblade master archer and has incredible sex appeal. Her uncle Ivan taught her swordsmanship her aunt Myra taught her magic and her other aunt Yolanda taught her how to please any man. Samson Stonesnow is a highmancer werewolf.All of the major villains  An even lazier answer. The heroes need to become as powerful as these foes to overcome them. Vincent is a bandit kingpin who can make an almost limitless army of copies to do his bidding. Bernard is called the Archmancer for a reason. He is said to have used necromancy to have stolen dozens of mancers powers. Alfred can transform into a giant stone golem with laser beams regeneration levitation and happens to have a huge cult of possessed wizards.Nonhumanoids Mythic beings  For funWado  A Rudra godlike spirit that brokered the One Promise between all spiritual beings. He basically sent angels to heaven demons to hell and so on and so forth. He now enforces the One Promise thousands of years later.Eoer  The great golden condor. A massive immortal bird said to have been the favorite pet of Rada the Supreme Rudra. Merely seeing Eoer grants your life good fortune and happiness.Zudolorn  A Rudra who killed Rada the Supreme Rudra. It took him decades of constant assault on Rada  who did not fight back  and Zudolorn almost died in the process. Other Rudra and spirits had him sealed away forever.,worldbuilding,dfaoku8,2,t5_2rd6n

If you use arcane magic you go the circle most appropriate given your school evokers to Wrath enchanters to Lust transmuters to Envy etc. Diviners are exempt as divination is the only holy school of arcane magicYou dont necessarily stay wherever youre sent. Souls are the currency of Hell and you may be traded about depending on an archdemon or earls needs.

To have a same sex female relationship is wasting a lot of time and effort on everyones part.The reason why more Bolhag dont make the transition is that males are somewhat more physically imposing and stronger. In most circumstances then an equal population would be preferred and thus the population would grow nicely. However the Bolhag are at near constant war with the Eskar. So the monarch of the Bolhag nation offers a choice. Either enlist in the Bolhag army or make the transition. Most choose the army as after a tour of a few years assuming they survive which is always a possibility they can return home and do what they wish whereas the transition is painful hard and irreversible. If youre too craven to do either then a transition is forced upon you which is even more difficult to do and often results in death itself. ,worldbuilding,dfcr4uc,5,t5_2rd6n

She casts a glare at the Shivite sits at the other end of the bar and orders something strong. A Sirenian walks in and starts drinking. She gets wasted fast as her bizarre metabolic heat regulation system means she cant burn off that alcohol.A Kalite walks in topless and wearing a ridiculous hat. She exchanges a few words with the Shivite while the human has to keep reminding himself not to stare at her breasts. The Sirenian gets on a stage and starts singing a cover of some sort of Asuran ritual song. The Asuran is offended and tells her to stop. The Sirenian tells her to fuck off.The Duati slinks into the bar and nobody notices. He is followed by a Sheorian. The Sheorian talks the Sirenian down. The Edenite comes in and the human grumbles in embarrassment for the degenerate fuck being a result of his species getting gene modifications.Theres a moment where an Ammitian walks in with a Mjolnir MK but the situation is promptly diffused by the timely arrival of a Bacchanite. The two of them sit with the Sirenian and begin discussing the merits of human art specifically the animated musical. There is some arguing but they eventually agree that Disney does them best and after more arguing and some drinks they decide that the best of these is Beauty and the Beast with Hunchback as a close second despite the Ammitians spirited and vehement argumentation that Prince of Egypt is better than either. He doesnt realize PoE was made by DreamWorks.It is at this point that the Kalite notices the Asuran and begins yelling at her. A Hatho walks in and intervenes on behalf of the Asuran and is promptly smacked in the face for her troubles.A barfight breaks out between the Kalite the Asuran and the Hatho which the human watches with immense interest as this is essentially the ultimate catfight. The Shivite attempts to break up the melee but succeeds only in bringing the drunk Sirenian into the fray.The Ammitian and the Bacchanite form a plan and take to the karaoke stage with a serving tray and a few glasses.

11380194,0,t3_62ctrf,Alchemy of Forms Outside of material world Physis there is also a data realm Logos that functions as a platform on which essences are recorded. Essences are data bodies attached to every physical objectphenomenon that make it what it fundamentally is. Altering essence alters also the object or phenomenon it encodes. To access Logos one needs Nous  which is basically ones own personal reality and an interface that allows them to influence Logos. Alchemy of Forms is based on using Nous to reprogram essences with the application of alchemical formulas commonly referred to as spells which are action sequences enforced on the data realm by caster and meant to be executed in the physical world. Spells are built out of seven basic sequences called Elements which can be divided into Classical and Philosophical ones. Every possible spell contains one or some combination of them. Classical Elements determine effects of the spell. There is four of them     Fire  corresponds with oscillation and radiation and allows to manipulate light sounds or heat.     Air  involves altering parameters of objects movement such as velocity acceleration inertia path.     Water  affects the process of absorption and interaction between particles and energy.     Earth  interferes with convergence of targets and various kinds of bonds like chemical or gravitational ones. The function of Philosophical Elements is to be a source that validates the Classical ones. These are     Sulfur  enhancesweakens selected properties or suppliesdepletes energy.     Mercury  influences reciprocal relations between objects or phenomena.     Salt  manipulates changeability of object or process. Every spell has to be started by a Activation Sequence and ended with a Termination Sequence. Casters power is limited by their Perception Capacity amount of information they can acces in Logos per second Computing Speed calculation power of their brain and Expression Strength an abstract value representing casters rejection of reality and basically equivalent of MP in games. There is no magical energy you spend by casting spells but more of them you cast or the stronger they are the less you motivation you have. Every essence has limited amount of computing memory so each new alchemical formula affecting certain essence is weaker or takes greater toll on caster. Within roughly  feet so called Immediate Alchemical Circle around them alchemist can access essence without even confirming position of objectphenomenon coded by it. Its like an uncanny awareness that allows caster to notice basically everything happening in a certain rage from them regardless of obstacles and sometimes even bypass certain counteralchemy spells. Caster needs input from their five senses e.g. seeing the target to pinpoint essences outside of IAC as stimulation of one sensory pathways leads to automatic involuntary experience in cognitive pathway synesthesia responsible for reading Logos. One sense is usually predominant in aiding Logos perception.,worldbuilding,dflxc96,2,t5_2rd6n

11423871,0,t1_dfqvb7w,Egyptian magic is very interesting. The basic conceit seems to have been that the Gods used some sort of primal creative force called heka to shape the universe. Heka sometimes personified as a minor god of the same name was present in all things. The Gods had the most animals and inanimate objects had some and humans had a varying amount. A person with a lot of heka could be a powerful sorcerer. Interestingly enough in Egyptian society there was little distinction between priest and sorcerer. Many temples raised money by having their priests sell their services as healers diviners charmers etc all the little tasks your average sorcerer performed in other societies. And unlike in GrecoRoman society where temple priests were respected while streetsorcerers were not Egyptian priestsorcerers had a pretty neutral reputation overall.Now the kahin is an interesting example. Almost all Arabic magic rests on the notion that you are manipulating djinn. How you are doing this varies. Most imams denounced magic saying that sorcerers who claimed to have power of their own were just being manipulated by djinn. That guy over there claiming he can fly? Just invisible djinn carrying him around hes a fraud. Now genuine kahin men who claimed to control djinn said they did it by different ways. Some called back to King Solomon and his magic seal which controlled djinn demons in the Christian version and said by use of magical incantations and symbols they could bind djinn to objects or force them to perform tasks though there were limits to what the djinn could do. Other kahin claimed to be holy men and like Christian necromancers or exorcists said that by virtue of being so holy their own divine power gave them authority over djinn. Some kahin just claimed that the djinn had taken a fancy to them and willingly performed favors for them. These guys were generally frowned on and still are theyre still around in modern MiddleEastern societies in the same way we still have con artist psychics in the West but in the Middle Ages Arabic society also had alchemists and astrologers who were seen as more legit.,worldbuilding,dfqvui8,2,t5_2rd6n

You dont retain your former personality when evolving to a greater hollow from a lesser one you gain a new identity partially formed from your old one. Some try to restrict themselves to a diet of strictly recently deceased corpses other seek relationships with sorcerers and espers so they can feed without harming anyone. Others continue to not care or believe that hollows are superior to nonhollows justifying their murderious diets.A hollow is basically what happens when the wrong kind of ether gains sentience inside your body. While white ether remains relatively inert in an overworld native it would also hollowfy a void native with very similar results. Ether can form a quasisentient consciousness though espers manage this by basically sealing the spirit into a weapon allowing them to massively increase their capacity for ether absorbtion.Look at it either like natural energy or like space mana.,worldbuilding,dfst2wv,1,t5_2rd6n

11449857,0,t1_dftrads,gt First off what are you doing with the long time periods? You just waved  years like it was nothing. History in the real world is only a few thousand years.Building off of this War is extremely profitable. It creates jobs it drives industry it makes the populace compliant and less likely to rebel at the stripping of their freedoms and it makes a select few people very very wealthy. Look at America after World War II. Were STILL chasing that dragon and its only been ish years.I am surprised that over this  year period your entire planet basically went Yup lets fight these demons as one big happy race. Nobody looked at it as a chance to settle an old score or drive a hard bargain or even make just a little cash?Were the demons universal in their disbursement? Did every nation get hit just as hard at the same time? If not then youre going to have a very different set of circumstances.If Country A and Country B dont REALLY like each other oh they do on the surface and Country A suddenly gets demons whats to stop Country B from saying Shit dude that sucks. Um...gimme  Billion for expenses and Ill come help. Because how does Country B know that the demons arent attacking Country A specifically? Maybe B is safe you know?Also what about religious conflicts doomsday cults endoftimes prophecies that are proving incorrect etc? These are demons as you say so whats to stop Religion A from declaring that this is because of Religious Tenant A not being followed so they need to go on a cleansing and purification run of mass slaughter and rape to show the demons how pious they all are? And Religion B gets the same idea at the same time? So now you have  crusadesjihads wandering the lands murdering anyone who doesnt follow the correct religious teachings.All this is to say you have some VERY deepseated ancient grudges that can start boiling up after too much peace that youre ignoring by handwaving away the entire conflict so you can get to what you want to write about. Those conflicts and reactions that people had during the conflict are going to be what drives your conflict now that peace has been achieved. But wait do the people know? Why stop a perfectly profitable venture just because the enemy is gone? Find a new one or continue to scream about boogeymen until everyone falls in line. Could be that the wasteland hasnt had any demons for centuries you know. Who said it had no demons? The Grand Union. Who profits from demon hunting fear mongering weapons manufacture and high taxes to support the war effort? The Grand Union. Who maybe has a top secret research facility in the wasteland attempting to weaponize the demons in case people get too complacent and start asking difficult questions? Well...maybe no one.

Its incredibly unlikely the third factors in but there are some closet cultists and botched assassinations that can end with tainting. Both individuals perform their duty as nobles be it social gathering or whathaveyou.  Hired help protects the grounds and raiseseducates their children.  children is the ideal where having less is seen as foolishness or weakness.  More than that is seen as lack of control or arrogance.For the Middle Class As with the upper class the breadwinner runs the family. If they cannot afford or dont trust a hired hand the other member is tasked with raising the children or protecting the household until one child is old enough to do it instead. The middle class tends to have  children as they tend to have higher postbirth mortality.  However they still want to mimic the upperclass.For the Working Class The male is the de facto head of house unless they are physically weak.  Hard labor tends to be all the working class can find and males can endure that lifestyle longer before theyre broken. The female will not work until their first child reaches  years of age.  It is then the childs duty to care for their siblings unless the family can survive with a single working component. Due to religions capable of preventing great harm or causing fertility among those that ask and the poorest being the primary base of worship the each household generally keeps having children until whatever deformities prevent it.  It is not uncommon to hear of a household of  children between one couple.  Short lives high mortality and immigration keeps things more or less stable.For Kobolds Barely recognized as a sentient race and given deplorable conditions even in comparison to the working class kobold family structure is equally chaotic. Kobolds live within multiunit structures where there are multiple males and multiple females sharing quarters.  Competition cheating and theft are constant threats within the household but living in single pairings is especially vulnerable to groups such as this looking for a new home. Due to very high attrition settled kobold females are expected to be constantly pregnant.  Kobolds have a gestation period of  months where the  eggs then take  month to hatch after birth.  Scholars have calculated that if nothing were to go wrong a single kobold female could produce several hundred eggs over her lifetime.,worldbuilding,dftxt6b,2,t5_2rd6n

11451720,0,t1_dftw55c,Conspiracies do require a suspension of beliefeven ones that have proven to be real are still weird an out there thinking Project MKUltra PRISM and the Manhattan Project. Youre gonna want to start off with why must this be kept secret. It could be due to wanting to keep things hidden from enemy spies it could be fear of political blowback it could be straight up paranoiabut youre gonna want to figure out why the secrets being kept. After that you can figure out who the conspiracy is meant forwhos the truth being kept from and therefor who gets to be in the know. And once thats settled you get to the howhow is this information kept from leaking? Threats? Mind control? NDAs? I mean a government trying to keep their nuclear program secret is going to approach secrecy differently than a corporation wanting to keep their next product launch under wraps. Believable conspiracies start from a solid foundation of the why must this be kept secret. The Harry Potter verse has a decent explanation of the who and the how but Rowling flubbed on the why and were never really given much of an explanation for the secrecy inuniverse. Out of universe we know wizards have to be secret for the modern world to still look like the modern world but in universe... enh? Muggles might hunt down wizards or something? Despite the fact that its shown in the books that muggles pose zero threat to wizards. Yeah...Flip over to say Stargate and the conspiracy at the heart of that series the US government has a piece of alien technology that allows them to travel across the galaxy. Why is this secret being kept well the military is kinda paranoid about letting others in on the fact that the Americans have this amazing piece of technologythe moment the Russians find out they want in too. So theres paranoia and military reasons there. And there are debates among certain characters as to whether or not this secret should be revealedwhether humanity is ready for the knowledge and can be trusted not to abuse it. And to make the case for keeping it hidden were shown a couple incidents of politicians and bad actors taking advantage of the stargate and the program for their personal advantagenearly starting a war with a more powerful races in one case. So theres a debate and the audience is encouraged to think that keeping the secret is a good thing for humanity. At least thats my take on it here!,worldbuilding,dfu1kmx,2,t5_2rd6n

Vast fields of Warroses have grown where great battles took place and where war saw kingdoms fall.They need to be nourished regularly so they have devised a method to lure their prey any sentient being that sets foot in a Warrose field will feel a sudden desire to kill. Usually Warroses would encourage their victims to kill each other in the bloodiest way possible to get the most out of them. Even when crossing a Warrose field alone suicidal thoughts will flood the mind of the unexpecting traveller.They never wither their single drive being the desire to grow endlessly.

Primarily the spacecraft relies on a missile loadout including several teleporting nukeships as well as the fleet under its command to do project power.The glowing tron lights on my spacecraft nearly always highlight a hangar. The spacecraft that I tend to post can be essentially thought of as combination skyscrapers and maritime warships conceptually in that they are individually commissioned and designed by architects like buildings and fielded a little like warships. Generally these hangars hold different craft depending on the role. This one in particular carries a single larger EWAR gunship shown to the right that provides indirect fire support designating targets behind cover in a stealthy manner an array of shuttlecraft and a few missile drones basically a simple piece of equipment that takes the place of a mine it lies dormant and undetected until something comes near it at which point it lets a missile fly.,worldbuilding,dg524gi,1,t5_2rd6n

Any more or any less then eventually one of the moons will catch up to the other and affect each others velocityThe only time multiple celestials can be in a stable orbit with a single other celestial is if their orbits are sufficient distance apart that the gravity of what they are orbiting overpowers the individual gravity wells of the orbiting bodies. IE one moon will be at km while the other is at km.However because an Earthlike has such a small mass and a relatively small gravity well  it can be difficult for more than one moon to find a stable orbit.EDIT Just remembered that Mars has  moons so you can use that as a baseline if youd like. ,worldbuilding,dg63qok,3,t5_2rd6n

What this means is that a given city will display several architectural styles side by side rather than one unified style.Within Vendalia time period region and purpose is the main arbiter of architecture not race. Generally flat roofs are popular unless youre in the central or eastern ranges or the Northeast Vendalia not being a snowy climate outside of those areas. Vendalia is pretty dense and urbanized and relies primarily on the electric streetcar for transportations suburbs being designed around them. Housing is typically  to  story apartment buildings or  to  family townhouses except for the inner city.The tan flat sided adobe often with small decorative crenellations is a classic historical style but not constructed today. A lot of old colonial era buildings still display this aesthetic so you still find examples and recently its become somewhat common to emulate it with new housing though wood and plaster would be used now not adobe.Gothic was at one point extremely popular for civic buildings though now its considered a bit too gloomy and imposing. The Gothic era coincides with one of the times of mass expansion in Vendalia and those buildings are built to last so its probably the most common big city civic architectural style even though a newly designed public building wouldnt use such an aesthetic today.More info later have to go work on something,worldbuilding,dg6jwtb,2,t5_2rd6n

During this time they follow to select destinations where ever their commanding officer sends them which does often include attacking supply lines and communication arrays.The most notable are that of EmeraldOmega an experimental unit which were tests to see the limitations of mimicAIs. Four recently deceased marines had their mind scanned and copied into Legionnaire bodies where they were lead to believe they were still human. They were sent to disarm an explosive device planted by a rebel cell which they succeeded in doing so. The Legionnaire pictured is Emerald who was the sniper of the squad before their demise and rebirth.They are vastly superior to tracked and hover units because of their versatility in a variety of environments and because of their ability to be dropped in units from orbit they are extremely quick to deploy making them often the first response units to a gaining situation.There were mechanised units before this such as larger Sentinel Artillery features and the like but no other ErwantHughes bots have sold as well as Legionnaire units.

11578944,0,t3_656vs1,Im not wellversed in Godzilla lore but it mainly hinges on whether or not he can handle Trinitys levels of radiation. Like Trinity is a selfcontained dyson sphere engineered by the Sisterhood whose founding species evolved on a hyperirradiated metalloid death world ages ago and as a result they either make use of biologies resistant to radiation or grant things autoionic immunity via nanomachines which prevents damage from most forms of harmful radiation. Most of their tech even down to something as simple as a tablet utilizes radiation and micronuclear force for power and communications.ampnbspSince Godzillas inexplicably showing up and theres not a Sister or Sapient Eight board around to autoionize his biology once he leaves the ocean hes either going to violently spontaneously combust and have his body liquefied and subsequently electrocuted from the inside out or hes probably going to really like it inworld because now his one essential resource is as common as water  moreso on Trinity even. If Godzilla makes it to the city any local populace caught on the street would be involuntarily translocated into a local building or fortification via citywide emergency teleport. On his end hes not going to be very enthused trying to destroy it because Sisterhood tech is borderline indestructible when being damaged by outsiders. It would be like the equivalent of stepping on lego pieces for him so once he realized not even singlestory office buildings were breaking under his advance I would hope hed try navigating around it?ampnbspOnce the Quintesce their panel of AI assistants or the coastal citys local government determined that Godzilla wasnt a threat a small number of automata as well as possibly one or two living specialists would tag him via autoionic immunization. The nanomachines would grant him even further enhanced durability as well as metabolic autonomy  Trinity being a radioactive honeypot notwithstanding nanomachines have the ability to regulate and synthesize a number of compounds in bareminimum quantities to prevent their owners from starving to death drowning suffocating etc. After being tagged Godzilla would be released into the wild via teleportation though it might take a minute or two longer than usual due to his sheer size.ampnbspTrinity has about  of Earths landbased surface area with the largest nature preserve inworld being about twothirds the size of Russia. These nature preserves also have artificial watering holes that can Replicate food and drink or other resources that a relevant animal might desire in its native habitat. They can also do things like produce holographic constructs of prey that produce food when being taken down to sate a carnivores desire to hunt. Godzillas watering hole would probably have to be manually tuned a bit due to his oddly specific diet but it could synthesize small cities for him to destroy while the sheer levels of radiation on Trinity would keep him healthy.ampnbspEDIT This prompt is just making me realize that on top of your average footsoldier being a Samus Aran on Trinity theyre basically the demon seed of Samus Aran and Godzilla.,worldbuilding,dg8ha4o,2,t5_2rd6n

11591174,0,t3_65dvbq,THAUM!s vampires are absolutely a full  on the FriendOMeter. Theyre a minor form of undead really suffering from a magical disease called cardiac solanecrosis heart death due to loneliness more commonly called Heart Rot or medically Stokers DiseaseBlood requirement Low to none. Solanecrosis patients require positive lifeforce to keep their hearts alive and due to their affliction cannot create any of their own. This makes them completely reliable on the lifeforce of others. Normally they are not parasitic but rather commensalistic they live off of the lifeforce naturally radiated by happy people with no averse effects. Theyre often able to live normal lives if they have happy neighbours and get an ample amount of hugs. However a starved vampire can react in a variety of ways. Craving type When depraved of a source of lifeforce for a short period such as a few days vampires might feel minor heart strain nausea and lightheadedness which increase to muscle pains cramps and severe heartache for longer periods. When deprived for extremely long periods  over four months  most vampires isolate themselves and waste away dying quietly of heart failure. However there is a small group that reacts the opposite way becoming feral and hunting for lifeforce on instinct resorting to assaulting people and attempting to drink their blood. These cases are rare and the attacks nonfatal but are still the most widely remembered aspect of the disease. Conversion The disease is not infectious nor does biting transmit it. Like cancer each instance is unique and can be triggered either by extreme loneliness for prolonged periods extreme emotional stress or trauma or simply a metaphysical malfunction of the body. Morality shifts There is no shift in personality caused directly by the disease though the affliction usually occurs in people with shared personalities  either reclusive tendencies or social ineptness. These often clash with the vampires hunger to be among people. Super powers None though solanecrosis is known to make mundane people aware to magic.Weaknesses None. The name is often misinterpreted to mean dies in sunlight but the sola in solanecrosis means loneliness and is unrelated to solar. Solar necrosis is a common misspelling of the name. Appearances Vampires share many physical traits the affliction of the heart usually leaves them pale and lanky while passage of lifeforce through the bodys energy points usually turns their eyes and nail beds lightish red or full red for a wellfed vampire. The veins on their chest around their heart turn black which spreads over the rest of the body depending on the severity of their condition.Overall wellfed solanecrosis sufferers make for pleasant caring neighbours that often go out of their way to help the people theyre dependent on. ,worldbuilding,dg9v8xv,3,t5_2rd6n

When mankind was freed from chains after nine years of being slaves they roamed the desert and came across The Pool. It was their source of water. A giant endless pit full of the freshest cleanest crystal clear water in the world. They built their first kingdom there. Some migrated some stayed. After long the Blood Soaked King came to power.He killed his father because he thought he was working against the kingdom. He was a true patriot to his land and anyone he disliked was tortured and killed. Their bodies were thrown into The Pool.  It was essentially his dumping ground. A mass grave for anyone he found unfit or unclean. After a while of doing this he discovered the possibility of spies. If he thought someone was a spy was drowned in The Pool along with their wife daughters and older sons.The youngest son of a family  and younger were taken into his army. Once they reached the age of  he drowned them too as a form of safety procedures.It didnt matter how loyal you were to him if he suspected your father of treason youre dead. If he suspects you of treason you and your family are dead. If he suspects anyone of being unclean or not worthy enough to sit in his presence he would have you executed.The bodies of the people that he slaughtered were thrown into The Pool. After some time the water turned black. Its believed this is because the souls escaped from the bodies mixed together and are trying to reach Afterlife but are trapped so when someone is drowned they attempt to leave turning the water clear again and when they die it turns black.Tldr The Blood Soaked King is the ultimate practicer of McCarthyism and is delusional paranoid and possibly schizophrenic.

As the Age of Technology gradually drew to a close more people who started to learn the truth called for the ban on magic to be lifted.

11658182,0,t3_66bm1y,The contraceptives fall into three categories passive proactive and active. I should note that the people involved here have an understanding of biology roughly equivalent to the early middle ages in our world. Those which are passive are things like prayers or the use of charms amulets animal parts etc. The proactive kinds involve more direct effort than the passive but do not introduce actual physical interference so this would include timing methods which tries to avoid the presumed most fertile periods. The active category includes things like barrier methods such as condoms. Potions are in the active category but are considered the most extreme case and most moraliststheologians do not differentiate between potions taken beforehand with the intention to prevent conception and those taken afterwards with the intent to end a conception that has already happened.Within the main context of this world according to religious authorities no contraceptives are permissible. This does not stop a large percentage of people from using them in their daily lives. So partly because the clergy fear losing the people if they press too hard and partly from actual pastoral concern about the daily lives of people the penalty or penance for contraceptive use can vary widely. The use of the contraceptives would be made known during the mystery of confession though some people never mention theyre engaging in it and a minority of priests even hint that its ok if the person doesnt mention it again.Factors include what type was involved passive etc. how often its been done the size of the family already and the age and social status of the people involved the clergy are especially careful to not push the upper classes too hard who are the main financial support for social work and missionary activity.It is in use much more by the upper classes and educated who feel like they have more control over their own destiny and are less likely to believe many of the things that the religious authorities teach. The lower classes on the other hand are much more likely to be worried about being punished for transgressing either God or the natural order. The lower classes are also much less likely to be satisfied with their lives making especially attractive the afterlife promised for those who do as the religious authorities say.,worldbuilding,dghgwvl,1,t5_2rd6n

After the war had been raging for a few years a necromancer who lived in the wilderlands on the fringe of the kingdom took the opportunity to raise the dead from many of the battles and use the skeletons of the fallen to end the war crowning himself the Necroking of Odomantis. The second bone war happened  years after the first when the Necroking of Odomantis launched a surprise invasion of the adjacent Kingdom of Botagonia. Botagonia also had a large mostly autonomous goblin population and because of the indifferent attitude of the rulers of Botagonia towards their goblin population the armies of skeletons had marched halfway into their kingdom before they even knew that there was a war going on thinking at first that it was just the usual goblin infighting. Much of the Botagonian upper nobility did escape before the Necroking marched into the capital the king and royal family currently reside in exile in Thespronia attempting to raise funds and alliances to retake their kingdom.The Slaughter in the Deep was a battle between merfolk and an alliance of whales and dolphins it was a surprise attack on the capital of the Meric empire on the ocean floor. A few hundred whale mages led the attack with an army of tens of thousands of dolphins. The dolphins assaulted the Meric Royal Guard to hold them off and defended the whale mages while they surrounded the city and cast devastating spells that resulted in the complete destruction of the city the deaths of  of its population including the entire Meric ruling class and the end of the Meric era altogether. ,worldbuilding,dgja4ah,2,t5_2rd6n

There have been incentives for young adults to join the police force and the pay is good. They will judge you based on character and whether you are clean. They will sack anyone who are acting out of line. The police force are trained to not be trigger happy and only use force when absolute necessary. Guns being banned in Iskandar helps. Majority of the population are peaceful and will not cause trouble besides the few bad apples but its good to have a sizeable police force to uphold the peace and security of the island. Especially against terrorism. There are some who do not like the police this is usually do to them upholding some laws that are passed by the government so its less of an issue with the police force. Generally the police patrols are paired usually people of different races or more in the context of my world culture. Lamias are useful due to their ability to lock someone with their serpent body. What different ethnicities and dialects exist within your world?The island may be closer in comparison with Hawaii it is a notSingapore comprising of pseudo malay chinese and indian culture. Dialects do exist but they are in favor of mandarin just like in real life and that its mostly with the chinese. Malay in Singapore and Malaysia are identical but Indonesia while similar are wildly different. There are probably variations in the malay in Malaysia but Im mostly focusing on the island nation of Iskandar anything outside is bottom priority asides major ones that affects the nation like the invasion of pseudo Japan. You might be thinking how other humanoids are categorised. Well race in this world means whether you are a human elf or demon or other variation of a human. Culture would be what a person belong to as an identity. So you can get a malay demon a chinese blood elf and other combo.

Magic doesnt just pull bullshit from nowhere it uses preexisting sources of energy light from the sun movement of the Earth through the universe a storm etc. and then focuses them down into a weaponizable form. The problem is without control it doesnt so much focus as cause it to go haywire. This isnt noticeable compared to a sufficiently vast amount of energy the kinetic energy of the planet hurtling through space or a small amount the sunlight or the breeze but the chemical energy held within conventional weapons is enough to cause severe problems for the user if magic decides to poke it too hard.So people can use guns but if youre going into a mage duel you dont want the leftover uncontrolled magic to set your gun off in its concealed holster.,worldbuilding,dgjp6aq,1,t5_2rd6n

Its a condition hes had all his life its just a bit more extreme now that there arent any muscles or tendons to at least keep it somewhat in check. When this happens he cant control it. He has to manually put it back in its socket. Then once its reconnected to his body he can move it again.If the brainspinal cord is destroyed beforeduring the bodys decay then no he definitely wouldnt be able to move the last remaining appendage at least he wouldnt be able to until the flesh completely decayed. As for after ... it is unknown whether the soul would take up residence in the single appendage or not.,worldbuilding,dgket6t,1,t5_2rd6n

A goblin tribe in which a Erlkonig has risen is less a camp of individuals and more a hivemind with carefully cultivated resources and no individuality. There are only two true deaths for a goblin For the flesh to be lost from goblinkind and for an Erlkonig to take you for from that point you and any of your cannibalizersnew lives are also thralls. It is a rare Erlkonig whose memories live beyond their death for what goblin would assimilate that filth into themselves?In times of great peril a goblin tribe might however fearfully participate in a ceremony designed to bring forth an Erlkonig using the ritualistic sacrifices and cannibalism of its own members. This is a last resort. Nearly every goblinoid must throw themselves into the truedeath and know that even if their body survives under the guidance of the risen Erlkonig their minds will not. The ceremony usually involves designating a single goblin besides the Erlkonig as the keeper of that tribes traditions lore and knowledge this goblin is killed and their flesh preserved. Should the Erlkonig and its thralls survive their task is to bring the preserved meat to another goblin tribe present it to be eaten then go find a way to give themselves the truedeath so that the blight on goblinkind may be extinguished.Just how often the Erlkonig obeys these dictates is not known.

Hatra hosts the largest of his temples as its centrepiece. Corialus rewards hard work research and boldness and merchants and traders the world over pay their respects to him and his clergy.Death and rebirth is entirely the responsibility of Morun Eterna the Dark Lady. She rules over the underworld where all human spirits eventually make their way after death to be judged and reborn accordingly.

It has actually not much to do with light itself but itis a traditional name. Finally some say that the Paladins of Solaris goddess of Justice Fire and the Sun Goddess Patron of Nithra also possess some form of Light Manipulation but in reality it is closer to fire magic and mostly generates heat and light is a side effect.

This has allowed them to build up a massive pool of manpower and currently fields the largest military. This military is used to bully neighboring regions into allowing them to collect taxation from weaker chapters. This taxation usually never finds its way back in infrastructure or defense so it can be assumed it is being pocketed.

11730010,0,t3_67dcdm,The universe is powered by the mystic astral energyall living creatures and gods have souls which are manifestations of this energy. Magic is effectively just warping reality to a slight extent by harnessing this energy. As magic is powered by astral energy which is the essence of life  it requires willpoweremotion and imagination. ampnbsp However only very few people are able to harness their souls to perform magic. Those with this intuition become sorcerers who use their imagination and intellect to come up with complex spells that manipulate the world around them. These spells are passed down as knowledge from one generation to another. Throughout the Middle Kingdoms there are colleges dedicated to the acquisition of old tomes practice of spells and the research into new spells. Of course certain kinds of magic have been forgotten over the aeons for example no contemporary mage is capable of far sight the ability to see the future though certain witch doctors in the distant land of Kerusia are rumored to still possess this ability.   ampnbspOf course human souls are weak thus the most powerful manifestations of magic require external sources of astral energy. One way is to use the souls of others though this immoral tactic is banned in all places that know of this wretched capability.Clerics and wood elves channel the energy of their respective deities to cast their unique magic. The fabled dragonbloods supposedly have the ancestry of dragons beings with potent souls and have greater innate potential for magic. There are also rocks imbued with immense astral energy theorized to be remnants of the World Spirit that created life on earth. Dwarves and elves in eastern lands have used these magical stones to shape odd and magnificent cities. ampnbspThere is another form of magic  the ghastly and esoteric demonic magic. The demonic realms are not powered by astral energy but by an unknown essence. Warlocks  sorcerers seduced by the enigmatic Lord Mehenai  exploit this energy to gain strange and horrific powers. As it does not involve astral energy this sort of magic is not a manipulation of reality  but rather a manifestation of otherworldly power into our dimension. However there seems to be a link between astral and demonic energy as Lord Mehenai grants this eldritch knowledge only to sorcerers.   Dabbling in this sort of magic is not inherently evil yet in recorded history it has led to nothing but tragedy from the rampage of the Black Horde to the  years of silence  thus it is taboo all across the Middle Kingdoms. ,worldbuilding,dgpml74,1,t5_2rd6n

11764127,0,t3_67rp7c,This is an interesting idea and often times the villains I and most people Ive seen like the most are those whose motivations are often better than the protagonists. This is something I have struggled with in my world because its extremely important to me that the villain of the main saga of my story be understandable if not sympathetic. Enoch the villain is essentially responsible for the destruction of the civilizations of the world that also shapes the setting of the main story even though he tries to save it. He gains some sort of immortality from surviving this event and spends the a few thousand years wandering around the world helping the remnants of humanity rebuild but not revealing his power or identity. However at the beginning of the main story he sees that humanity is starting to make the same mistakes as the previous worlds civilizations in particular building weapons of mass destruction using human souls. He then decides that humanity will make the same mistakes in a cyclic manner without end destined to destroy itself unless he uses his newfound power in order to take over humanity as a ruler in order to protect humanity. However this comes at the cost of him destroying humanity in another world ending event in order to effectively restart the world.I dont particularly agree with Enochs methods but I do think that humanity is more likely to destroy themselves if given complete and total freedom with no organization not anarchy but you know not totalitarianism. I personally think Enoch isnt incorrect in his beliefs but based on his situation and his life he doesnt have faith in humanity like the main characters would. I definitely try to show Enochs internal struggle with this decision since he doesnt want to kill everyone but he does believe it is the best decision for humanity overall. Thats what I think is the most interesting thing about building villains is how close they really are to the protagonists.,worldbuilding,dgthrqs,2,t5_2rd6n

I thank you for the criticism but honestly I have no intention of changing because I want those races because I am lazy and because it is related to the plot of my world and in that order.To me this is worldbuilding. Nobody makes an uninfluenced world. The interesting part is making it yours making it different which is exactly the thing you brushed off immediately. I honestly cant make a unique race. Everything I have is based on other works and theres nothing wrong with that because Ive done my best to make it mine and thats all that matters not from where these influences most commonly come.,worldbuilding,dgu91ag,10,t5_2rd6n

11782974,0,t3_683xkc,My world has a river of Flow Imagine a magical northern lights that flows through the skies. It is essentially the essence of the soul magic and life. When someone dies there soul rejoins the river and eventually they are distributed magically back into the trees and other forms of life. However my world is not a healthy one Gore the origin of demons caused the flow to pass through himself. Most souls therefore when dying enter GoreHell to be processed by him to shape them towards perfection until they break free or are released. When my players die they either make new characters or have to fight the trails of hell each death brings them one circle deeper. The longer they spend there and with each death within hell the more messed up and twisted their character becomes. One of the characters was a bard healer by the time they were rescued was a demonic half banshee who could sing deep wounds to all who heard her song. My players have to decide make a new character or fight to keep their old one but they will rarely make it out without twisted alterations. Which always makes them Stronger but with more apparent weaknesses,worldbuilding,dgvmzl7,1,t5_2rd6n

Their first god Uuanai gave them this power so they would instinctively try to defeat gods or stronger mortal races if they became too arrogant or dominant in the world.

11785060,0,t1_dgv38xo,Thats an idea Ive toyed with but specifically science fiction. The idea is that technological research lead on multiple discrete occasions to the creation of technologies that give people godlike powers. Each time this happened either the means and knowledge to bestow this power was immediately wiped out by the first to receive the power or the entire nationcolony is wiped out in the resulting chaos and struggles for power leaving only very few people with godlike powers.These godlike people arent necessarily revered as Gods by everyone at every time but there are many who are immortal and very much enjoy keeping the truth behind their powers from the relatively primitive alien species they like to show off to.,worldbuilding,dgvvixg,2,t5_2rd6n

11788016,0,t3_6837h2,Threadcutter a blade forged by four wise men in order to overthrow the tyrant Ort. The materials of the blade come from a meteorite whose metal has no known origin or equal. The metal severs any enchantment it encounters and can cut most known materials as well. In order to cut an enchantment the blade requires a catalyst namely for its wielder to provide it with Power of their own. The risk here is that should the wielder lack the necessary control the blades first act upon being catalyzed can be one of a few things. Best case scenario Threadcutter automatically deactivates itself and becomes a particularly sharp piece of well crafted metal. Worst case scenario the backlash severs the source of Power in the person trying to wield it and they can no longer weave their power at all.The blade was given to Macen member of the famous Eight Rebels who overthrew Ort and his feudal lords. It was intended for the leader of the Eight but was gifted to Macen when the four wise men learned of the demise of the other seven in the ambush at Karish Canyon.,worldbuilding,dgw7lwp,1,t5_2rd6n
