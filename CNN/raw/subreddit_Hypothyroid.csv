3319895,0,t1_cp61cu0,I still struggle with getting out of bed and doing things sometimes. I try to stay as motivated as possible and try not to do burn myself out on days when I do have more energy. I dont have Hashimotos but I know for me that I do need to give me medication time to work its thing and just try my hardest to practice self care and eating a balanced diet whatever a balanced diet with lots of nutritional value may be for you. To get back into the routine after I feel better I just set some daily goals I need to do as soon as I get up clean myself stretch take my medication clean a bit and continue with the day. ,Hypothyroid,cp6p30p,2,t5_37a2m

10948717,0,t3_5uzte7,I have subclinical hypothyroidism and while my husband and I have had no issues conceiving weve unfortunately lost every baby in the first trimester. Before I started treating the thyroid problem I had very irregular cycles and a variety of hormonal issues low progesterone after ovulation high testosterone insulin insensitivity high prolactin and low vitamin D. Thyroid treatment has improved all of this. I have regular cycles for the first time in my life and feel so much more energetic! Unfortunately it hasnt been a magic bullet as far as the miscarriages go but we are pretty sure that our most recent miscarriage was chromosomal rather than thyroid related.Ive found the American Thyroid Associations pregnancy guidelines helpful. Its organized in questionanswer format. If you want to do a quick search they use SCH to refer to subclinical hypothyroidism in some places. They list the studies they used to come to these recommendations as well.This literature review from the American Association of Reproductive Medicine might also interest you. Weve also found fertility awareness very helpful for diagnosing issues. We learned the symptothermal method of fertility awareness before we married which was what really convinced us that I had a thyroid problem in the first place very low temperatures!. After our first loss we started looking for a doctor with experience treating thyroid problems in young women who are TTC. We ended up finding someone through this website which lists doctors trained in something called NaPro. Its very focused on finding the underlying causes of infertilitymiscarriage which we appreciate. Our doctor encouraged us to learn another method of fertility awareness called Creighton which has more exact description for cervical mucus observations. Doctors often like the precision because it gives them more information to guide the tests they order etc. We really love my doctor and were so appreciative of NaPro! One of the really cool things is that since it sees infertility or miscarriage as a symptom rather than a diagnosis insurance typically covers treatment because doctors code for the actual issue not just that conception hasnt occurred.Has your doctor run a full thyroid panel? TSH T T and thyroid antibodies? Typically you need all of these to get a complete picture. Theres also a ton of other tests that are often recommended for infertilitymiscarriage but doctors typically pick the highest priority ones based on your symptoms.Edit Fixed link. ,Hypothyroid,de9a6q8,1,t5_37a2m
11061163,0,t1_delq847,I always recommend charting your cycle since its so helpful for timing tests and medications but I agree that its not a magic bullet all by itself. Did you request the results from your tests? That might help you figure out where the PCOS diagnosis is coming from. Some doctors are generous with their diagnosis of PCOS and will diagnosis it even if the only signs are insulin issues high androgens or LHFSH imbalances. Its not necessarily a bad thing  it can help you get insurance coverage for further blood tests and drug treatments which arent typically covered if infertility is the code. Even if youre ovulating regularly there may be problems that are making it difficult to conceive or to carry a pregnancy until the point that you can test. You mentioned low progesterone  are you sure thats been fixed? Id also recommend double checking your results to see if their associated with higher risks of infertility. Sometimes the normal ranges are quite broad and designed to include  year old men so a normal result can still be quite unhealthy for a young woman trying to conceive. One thing my husband and I have found very reassuring is that couples dealing with unexplained infertilitymiscarriage are still very likely to have child even without receiving any treatment if they keep trying. And hopefully youll find a doctor who is willing to investigate this soon!,Hypothyroid,delrjo7,2,t5_37a2m
