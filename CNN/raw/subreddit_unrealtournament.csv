3333287,0,t3_2y5hbi,Movement is nice but the map seems very random both design and theme wise. Outpost  for example gives you the feeling of actually being in an outpost. I guess its just preference.I just started working with a mate on a map and my goal is to try and achieve both fluid and fun map movement while still aiming for a realistic theme. It will be hard because UT maps are often very focused on purely design but I think a more modern approach to UT maps will also be beneficial to new and casual players. ,unrealtournament,cp87yht,1,t5_2rqzh

I loved its sleek and delicate design the one in UT is too bulky IMO if they could thin it a bit more it would become my new favourite. Link Gun UT. Good technologicalmilitary mix. Minigun UTK. The UT version feels too much scientific it must retain its military feel. Flak Cannon UT. I love its raw industrial look. My favourite weapon design in the whole game. Rocket Launcher UT.

5805099,0,t3_3ubf32,Lag compensation was utterly terrible in black ops II and destroyed the multiplayer on pc. It literally gave an advantage to players with garbage net and kept creating situations in which players that get shot at first act as bulletsponges and then they turn around and instantly kill you while they werent even looking at you yet on your end.It didnt help that the game had a deathcam. The amount of times you saw via deathcam that you got shot by someone even though you werent even remotely in his fov anymore on your end was insane.UT however has a way higher timetokill which makes lag compensation far less problematic imo. I would still prefer the game without it however. Preaiming starts at a ping of  which is something the majority of the players hopefully never have to deal with. And even if they have to its alright you can deal with it with practice. Just...no shenanigans like this please ,unrealtournament,cxgoe8g,2,t5_2rqzh

Change up your timing. You can avoid being hit just by running more of the time than you think.Dont jump too much. When you jump you become very predictable for the time you are in the air and you can expect a rocket waiting for you when you land.Learn the maps. Learn where all the items  especially the Keg and Shield Belt are.Make yourself a route around the map that takes in all the useful items. Then make a new one. Then make another one.Have a plan for every possible spawn point. Know where the bestmost appropriate weapons are from every location.Learn to navigate the maps with wall dodges.

8379886,0,t1_d5nu96q,gt Youre putting the cart before the horse buddy.Youre putting words into his mouth.Nobody is asking for super polished or full mod support whatever that is maybe I am asking for full mod support. People are asking for decisions that make sense and actually have logic based reasoning behind them.Whats wrong with the UI? Just look at the latest UI WTF I cant even. I shouldnt have to explain why popping up giant bubbles all round your crosshair is a bad idea in a game that is supposed to be about precision and visual acuity.Movement is awful. It doesnt feel crisp or anything. Its very mushy compared to previous games and neither feels fast nor fluid nor really fun. Many people have left the game over just this one issue. Just play an old UT game or even something like OW for an hour and then immediately play UT. The problem with fixing movement is that as movement gets fixed maps will have to make changes to accommodate the new movement. Dealing with it after a bunch of nearfinal content exists is a ludicrously bad way to go about things. Not only that but the scale is still off and doesnt feel good. Fixing scale will again break tons of content. Just look at how garbage Outpost  is now.Just to close the loop on this post nobody is asking for the game to be done. To call this game in early prototyping phase is completely silly. If it is in that phase its because Epic refuses to bring it out of that phase. Still there are many prealpha games that have better mechanics and gameplay and are much farther along with equally small teams and more than likely even smaller budgets Im talking Kickstarter level in less time.But its okay everything is going to be fine if we just keep repeating...,unrealtournament,d5p18xh,4,t5_2rqzh

11654557,0,t1_dggjl3r,I dont think that its because of the hidden viewmodel I think it is directly because Valve chose not to support it as an Esport. I think that if they had chosen it to stand alongside DOTA or CSGO their development decisions would have been very different. I am fully aware of the history of TF. It is not a very popular game on Twitch either.I used to watch a lot of pro CS streams and a lot of SummitG when he focused on CSGO. I also played the game casually and spent about  on skins because I saw them on streams and thought they were cool. Does that make me a casual? Maybe. Did it impact the integrity of the game as an esport? No. A decision made to widen the casual playerbase without killing the competitive playerbase is a good decision in my opinion.,unrealtournament,dgh249m,3,t5_2rqzh
