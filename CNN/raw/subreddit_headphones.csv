6115,0,t3_1u70ca,Not sure about the specific tubes you mentioned but in general tubes vary to some degree. Because of their somewhat mechanical innards and relatively crude manufacturing nature compared to semiconductor fabrication even ones made by the same factory at roughly the same time could vary a bit. This is why if you are dealing with pairs of tubes one per channel you need to have them matched to have much more similar characteristics. For more information on how tubes are made you can check out this video.The Aune T uses a single tube so you dont have to worry about matching. But based on what I said above you should understand that even the same type of tube could sound different how different they sound is pretty subjective. Prices vary a lot as well as many are older tubes more expensive as they are rarer while others are newly made. Your best bet is to search up some reviews specifically the factorycompany that made the tube and the year it was made in for old tubes. I wouldnt spend too much rolling tubes on a T though you are probably much better off by spending the extra money on a better amp.,headphones,cef4spg,1,t5_2rcyx

215239,0,t1_cf2xv9a,gt You brought up the K even though the original commenter never mentioned it instead the Q was mentioned which is very similar to the K. I couldnt find K measurements comparable to the InnerFidelity measurements so I used the K instead for comparison. I did not extrapolate any result to the K in fact I never even mentioned the term K after the initial line.He mentioned etc and like  the idea being that the K isnt even AKGs flagship would align it with that group or below ironically some like me think the K is a superior headphonegtAbsolutely false. FR is just the frequency response when given an input signal e.g. hz signal at Vrms in whats the dB out at hz the shape of the response square sine sawtooth etc... is not measured.No but the ability to produce the square wave will inherently be reflected.  The inability to dissipate energy build energy too fast etc. will all impact the FR.  This is why headphones with a flat bass response like the Audeze excel at the squarewave test and viceversa.gtMaybe I should remind you what the fi in hifi stand for. Its short for fidelity of which THDN is a very important factor. And distortion over the  range can definitely be audible.At what frequency and with test or real world signals?   distortion at hz certainly isnt in a real world scenario see masking.gt Im simply comparing the ones I can find comparable data for.Then why bother replying to me its not relevant.gtNot quite. If you look at the bottom half of the hz square wave you will see that the K bleeds off energy much faster to the point of reaching the zero line by the end of the cycle. You need to know how to look at square waves as there are many things to look for one of which is the flatness of the top the two are comparable but the ability to retain energy is also important staying abovebelow the zero line.Its still flatter all around so at best the HD can retain energy a bit more but cant hold it properly.  Another compromise . . . something something its not perfect or immediately superior . . .gtSure but how do you know a  distortion is inaudible? At certain frequencies masking will hide it.   at khz would sound fucking terrible at hz though?  Good luck hearing it.gtThats in the range of very tubey sounding tube amps which definitely have an audible difference in sound. The Ks THDN also nearly reaches  between khzkhz at dB so its not just in the bass frequency.Well considering theres issues with the THDN tests on IF sometimes I usually assume the numbers lean against all headphones a bit.  Masking should be sufficient for this case.  Ive hardly noticed a hint of distortion in them in regular use . . . equally I listen below dB dB.gtAnd I never did say anything about extrapolating the results. While we are on the subject though look at the K vs HD distortion graph from HeadRoom. The highest harmonic distortion the most audible of the K is considerably higher than the HD dB vs dB. dB below the fundamental could definitely be audible well within the dynamic range of CDs where as dB is much less audible and quite close to the dynamic range limit of CDs of dB.dB is .Oh no thats horrendous . . . sarcasmgtI never said that headphones should be judged on measurements alone. I simply used measurements to show the difference between midfi and hifi headphones.Really I use measurements  audibility in relation to measurements.  It doesnt matter if it measures better on one area if you cant hear the difference of it.  In comparison the FR is well understood to effect audibility.gtThe slow decay in the upper FR past khz is supposed to happen in the ideal case. Heres the graph for the SR which Tyll the guy doing the measurements remarked as the ideal decay path after khz source see second last paragraph on that page. Youve been reading these frequency graphs all wrong if you are expecting the ideal curve to be a flat line. Ideal FR is not a completely linear line. But I do agree that the LCDs treble rolls off a bit more than it should.Thats actually Tylls opinion.  The Headroom graphs were based on DF equalization Tyll did them and hes since changed to another type as well.Im quite familiar with Tylls measurements and thoughts.  Not everyone agrees on the importance or his preference in sound.,headphones,cf2yksv,0,t5_2rcyx

The  is a major upgrade from the  and is better in every way other than isolation. The DJ is on a closer level to the  and is a better headphone to me and it also costs less at the moment. The Koss to me sounds clearer more open even though its still a closed headphone and to me has a more forward and even frequency response.

So those are small advantages too. They do feel a bit less substantial than the Ms though.

482538,0,t1_cfv2tz7,I can explain. At this point I will be keeping the AKG K but I also liked the mx very much. Originally I was looking for bassy headphones to match my XBA. For me its very important that there is sufficient bass especially deep extended bass and highs that arent rolled off.The COP sounded pretty good to me with its unique warm sound signature but the highs were a bit rolled off. I had bought them for  but I decided I should just go for more expensive ones.M had great bass. Maybe a little too much but what bothered me was the heavily recessed upper mids. I could not listen to a lot of music in which the instruments were supposed to have timber. It sounded like listening to music through steel cans plus bass. Sometimes female vocals would even disappear almost completely. I could not get used to them. I even ordered the XL pads from Vmoda so they wouldnt hurt my ears but I returned those as well.Denon D had too much bass and everything else was too relaxed with quiet but sparkly highs. Ironically to me they sounded good with a lot of band music that wasnt bassheavy but they sounded too flabby otherwise.NAD VISO HP. I read rave reviews and I saw their frequency response graph on headphones.com which I guess was a complete lie when it came to the bass. They were somewhat warm but the bass was seriously lacking to the point where in many modern songs any transition that had to do with bass was completely lost. The headband also struck me as super ugly and I dont think they would have been comfortable as they werent really overear but I repacked them within a few hours of opening them. I think these headphones sounded great in all other departments. Sort of boring and analytical but I could get used to it if I didnt care about bass.AKG K I am using them right now and I like the sound very much. The sound isnt perfectly ideal but for  I am okay with that. My biggest complaint is the horrible earpads that come with them. Not only do they hurt my ears since they press up against the headphones they dont even provide an adequate seal. If I scrunch them up with my hands the amount of bass goes up. I opened up the pads and stuffed in  pieces of cotton balls per side which improved the bass completely and somewhat helped the comfort issue. I am going to get custommade earpads in China when I get the chance.Audio Technica WS Sort of like the K in the mids and highs but the bass was just thumpy and annoying and not as wellextended. Also uncomfortable.Audio Technica mx Basically all the positive reviews I read were true. These sound all around great to my ears with more forward high mids than the K. These are my second favorite pair of all and are also more comfortable. I might still keep them.My problem is that I started off with my Sony XBAs which I listen to A LOT while biking. I think they are great but being  ohm they dont work with my computer unless I resort to an amp which I dont want for various reasons. I was initially looking for something equivalent to the XBAs but now I am starting to appreciate my Ks a lot for their strengths compared to the XBAs.,headphones,cfv493i,2,t5_2rcyx

They are discontinuing a now  headphone and replacing it with a  headphone. Chance are high that hype keeps the i prices up for over a year at that price.So to me the real question is will the i be  better than the ? And then will the i be as good as the current  since they will be closer in price than i to ?Id say if you like what youve read about the  and have studied up then now is an excellent time to buy. With that said I love my HE but would be hesitant to make them my all around headphone choice. They sound especially bass extension is like nothing Ive heard of in its price category.All my theorycrafting though is based off price vs. performance.

If something played FLAC and not ALAC I would be just as inconvenienced as you are in the opposite situation.

775101,0,t3_22z59d,I went with the JHs and they are just awesome.  The treble and imaging is about as good as you can get from an IEM.  Headphones can do a better job since the sound wave hit your ear from the outside but even then the JHs stand right up to good imaging headphones.  I would say that the treble end both JH and  is about as good as it gets.  Most people say that the JH is neutral but its definitely got a bass emphasis.  In saying that though it is very mild and the bass is just spot on perfect just a little more prominent than neutral.  You cant go wrong with either but Id say to get the JH unless you really really want some bass emphasis in your music.  For instance I have s and a HiFi m so if I want to get close to JH level bass I just hit the bass boost on the m.  Thats the only difference between the two really,headphones,cgsdt5z,1,t5_2rcyx

840468,0,t3_23lc7o,I have a K and the th pads. The stock pads are angled while the new pads are not. The new pads also use memory foam. The sound becomes overall warmer with an apparent increase of bass and volume. It becomes louder because of the distance from the driver to your ear being shorter. The soundstage is slightly reduced though still wide compared to other headphones in its price range. The th pad is much softer compared to the rigidity of the stock pads. To me both are comfortable.There is an pretty distinct difference in the overall sound between stock and th different enough that I switch between pads quite often depending on how I feel. th pads do make the headphone more versatile being a better allrounder.,headphones,cgztb2f,2,t5_2rcyx

842212,0,t3_23qd5y,Ive owned mine for about a year and heres my impression on them. Sound is average for what you buy. They are a more balanced IEM in my opinion compared to other IEMs Ive tried in the past. Since I use them for working out at the gym I tend not to focus too much on listening as I do for the isolation. Comfort and isolation are about average again. I found the double flanged rubber tips are the best you can get with what they provide but are still uncomfortable. Ive since changed to comply foam tips and theyve improved isolation comfort and a bit of the sound. Microphonics are really good for this pair the cable is really light and its great for runners. Memory wire takes a bit to get used to. The wire is inflexible as it is intended and I found it hard to wrap perfectly around my ear for the first few weeks of daily use. After a while though it will form the contour of your ear and you wont even notice it. Durability is great on this IEM probably the best Ive encountered for cheap IEMs that Ive tried. Usually the left or right channel cuts out due to the wires fraying around  months but so far I havent experienced this and I bought mine around  months ago. In all pretty good for a sport IEM with the bearing that these should be used for working outsports. ,headphones,ch00g8f,1,t5_2rcyx

1040641,0,t3_25zs72,You can get FLAC quality from CDs you can rip CDs from iTunes to ALACsynonymous to FLAC and will work on your iDevices. Depending on where you live there are streaming sites that stream FLAC but in the US theres nothing that I know of right now. I use Spotify Premium to discover new music and buy the songs in FLAC that I really like. If youre looking for higher qualityk and above I know hdtracks.com exists. They also have a sampler but you have to have a bit DAC that can play them.Solid state vs tube depends on what kind of sound youre looking for. The best SS for the money would probably be the OODAC combo which is truly flat and backed by measurements. Its a very controversial DACAMP but I enjoy it more than the Schiit MagniModi setup I was running a few weeks ago. If youre looking for tube theres a lot of choices. I had an Aune TTube DAC before although the amplifier is nothing special but the DAC is good and the tubes are cheap. If you want something cheaper you can buy that  tube amp the Bravo V but I cant say anything since I never auditioned them.Cables dont really make a difference IMO but if you hear a difference in yours then why not. I had my LCD recabled because I wanted balanced cables if ever I get a balanced amp in the future. IMO its better to get the straight cable instead of coiled. If youre looking for good quality cables on the cheap like RCA or XLR.When you hit high end audio theres a lot of polarized opinion so learn the physics behind each deviceamplifier dac headphones and understand what you want because that will determine the  you spend on it as well. Its easy to be swayed by comments that say I was blown away by x y z and I really hated A because it sounded too neutral and dull. From what I know there are two schools of thought subjective and objective. Can you have good measurements and good sound? Possibly but thats a gray area because its subjective. Well good luck!

The way the SRes new driver and plastic housing move air and react to sound vibrations virtually eliminate transient distortions. This allows the signal flow over the new cable to reproduce sound that has tight control of the upper and lower range of the frequency spectrum...

1211237,0,t1_ci5umdm,Its a fair point but if you read the background on this I dont think anyones ever tried to claim its the ODA.  Its just inspired by it.As you say its an iterative process.  This is already V after multiple iterations and John is going to go over it with a dScope.  There can and likely will then be a V and so on.  Thats pretty much the O ethos in a nutshell with a slightly elongated timeframe because not everyone can afford a dScope.The only one of the O principles definitely violated so far here is that it uses SMD parts which personally I dont consider that bad especially since the ODAC the first step toward the real ODA was also all SMD parts and intentionally wasnt DIYfriendly. This amp doesnt use designer parts or anything hard to find has wide compatibility is fairly DIY friendly doesnt try to fake a virtual ground or anything is being iteratively designed with measurement and ticked every one of the functionality boxes NwAvGuy outlined for the original ODA in terms of wider compatibility preamplineout better supply rear connections easy ODAC integration and relaybased protection.It also already measured better than the O for factors that could be easily tested.  Theres certainly been some controversy in portions of certain audiophile communities but I also wouldnt claim that objective testing is  unique to the O it is or should be circuit design not religion   Anyway just my c.  ,headphones,ci5vs2o,2,t5_2rcyx

1304539,0,t1_cig69vp,Im going to elaborate a little now that I have some time. The reason I was under the impression that there should be essentially a standardmost advanced crossfeed function relates to my understanding of how it works. I was under the impression that the entire goal is to mimic the HRTF which could theoretically be calculated by taking measurements of your head and accounting for high frequency losses due to the distance the shape of your ear and the potential absorptive properties of your skinhair not sure how significant this part is. As such Id think that you could theoretically just plug in the info about yourself and get a pretty good simulation. Obviously you cant get it perfect for everyone but Id wonder how far off is too far off...? I have no personal experience with these programs but was under the impression that this is not common for some reason Im on mac by the way. The differences between softwarehardware crossfeeds Id think would be similar to phono preamps where the RIAA equalization is a set amount of boostingcutting certain frequencies but some companies monkey with this  which may or may not be aurally pleasing. Is my analysis correct? Please add or correct anything Ive written above.,headphones,cigdl9y,1,t5_2rcyx

1451897,0,t1_ciy9kky,K  Better low end extension. Can be fatiguing in the upper mids. Upper mid spike makes them sound a bit plasticy. Overall a good headphone but considering that you can get the HD for cheaper I dont know if theyre a good buy. Soundstage is wider than the HD but not deeper.EDIT It looks like the K has come down in price and is about the same price as the HD now.HD  Better mids. More mid bass. Less fatiguing. Tonality is more accurate and more natural. One of the few headphones that can trick my brain into believing that noises are coming from behind me or around me rather than from the headphones. This is due to the accuracy of the timbre not the soundstage which isnt particularly wide or deep but is adequate.Both are very comfortable but at times the K can feel a little too loose on the head.,headphones,ciy9r4r,6,t5_2rcyx

1456049,0,t1_ciys6ba,Hm. The HD was like a DT but with a deeper and more immersive soundstage and presentation. By that I mean its quite neutral with a bit of a treble tilt. I had issues with the treble that I mentioned in previous comments that you can find in this thread. Because of that issue if it were me I would choose the TH. But the TH is a different signature. Its fairly neutral as well but it does have a bass emphasis that is definitely noticeable but not overdone IMO. Soundstage depth and immersion is even better on the TH. IMO its the one to get out of the two.,headphones,ciyshht,1,t5_2rcyx

1633587,0,t3_2d0wat,My friend has a Blue spark microphone and when he plugs his headphones into that he claims its better quality than the sound card of his macbook likely because the blue spark has a very good DAC and amp inside it I dont know if its the same DAC and amp used in the yeti but honestly its very easy to just AB test it against your onboard sound and make your own mind.EDIT did some research on it and the headphone amp built into it is above average compared to most motherboard audio it shouldnt have a problem driving s at all but again compare the quality of it against your motherboard to determine if it sounds better or not.,headphones,cjl2ucb,3,t5_2rcyx

1667075,0,t1_cjpa904,The SE is pretty phenomenal.  But they are a universal headphone so unless you get the custom sleeve they dont have the benefits of a custom fit.  When you figure the  impressions  sleeves cost for the SCS youre looking at   prime CIEM territory.I would say that the SE is about  to the quality of the K.  It has a bit more bass emphasis so if thats your thing you might actually prefer it slightly to the K.  However the K is much better at layering and producing a cohesive sound and it has just a bit of extra oomph in the mids and highs.  I actually think that the K has better quality and better quantity bass than the SE ... its just that the SE has it always there sort of like a subwoofer that adds a bit of bass thump even if its not actually in the recording while the K only gives you the bass if its called for.  When not its out of the way.If you love bass I think the SE compares favorably with the Noble C.  It definitely has more bass than the C and C.  The C is much more neutrally tuned.  They bass is polite and there when needed but its not there if its not called for.  I would say that the C is a bit more neutral.Honestly I love the SE.  I cant directly compare it to the C because I dont have a custom C.  My wife does have the C though and she much prefers it to the SE which has entirely too much bass for her.  She tells me that the highs are a bit better on the C as well.  This can be heard in snare drums and cymbals.,headphones,cjpaosq,1,t5_2rcyx

Simple things first I dont believe for a minute that these cost  more in materials and workmanship as compared to the Alpha Dog. RampD costs aside Id put  of that as additional profit. Thats a pretty minor gripe by itself though. Better quality doesnt always mean higher manufacturing costs but youre going to price it for its performance. Thats normal. As for performance were given no information and told that any future information may somehow not actually show the positive differences. As little as I like it listening tests may be the only way to go with it. Last I heard hes not planning on sending a demo pair around. Thats no good. How are owners of his other headphones supposed to make a comparison? Back to RampD Alpha Dog was only revealed around a year ago. Thats ignoring the various revisions that have happened over the next months some of which should have been there from the beginning. Foam dots on the driver is nothing new to TRP mods and Dan was recommended them in the development stages. Somethings not right if that can be disregarded until after a number of units have already shipped. Anyway were now told that in the time period since the Alpha release some new changes have been found that make significant sound quality improvements. What is it that it could be missed for the whole time looking for improvements beforehand? I cant help but feel like its another thing that should have been in the Alpha Dog all along. I would be much more supportive of the different price tiers if they were released alongside each other rather than this coming out as an afterthought. When you release a flagship product and tout it as the cumulative result of years of designing and testing its a slap in the face to your customers to offhandedly introduce the new best thing such a short time later.,headphones,cl0yzzq,3,t5_2rcyx

2094288,0,t3_2iugrh,Ive been using cheap  earbuds at work and I want something where I can actually hear the bass. Budget   flexible Source  Vanilla work computer. I believe its Realtek High Definition Audio. Requirements for Isolation  This is pretty important as Ill be using them in a cube. Willing to sacrifice midhigh punch for clarity if thats an issue. Preferred Type of Headphone  Overthehead Circumaural. I will be wearing these for  hours at a time so comfort is very important. Preferred tonal balance  Good bass good mids decent highs Past headphones  I honestly dont remember the name of them but they were open overthehead and but not noisecancelling. The former makes them fairly uncomfortable after  hours of use. Preferred Music  Downtempo Trance Electro House Jazz Fusion e.g. Samurai Champloo A lot of the EDM I like has female vocals so something with good mids and decent highs would be excellent. Artist examples are Armin Van Burren Fat Jon Gesaffelstein Para One Massive Attack.,headphones,cl613me,1,t5_2rcyx
2097777,0,t3_2ixr5b, Budget  Up to  but no strong desire to max it out Source  ASUS PK motherboard OnePlus One phone. Not great by any means I might consider upgrading on the mobo part if theres much to be gained.  Requirements for Isolation  Im not too sure. Ill mostly be using the headphones in my room. They shouldnt make too much noise I live with  others that I dont really want to bother and theres no need for them to block out everything but it would still be nice to sit on the train while being able to thoroughly enjoy the headphones. So for location I guess its home where I dont want to bother others and public places where I dont want others to bother me or me bothering them. Preferred Type of Headphone  I had IEMs for the past  years different pairs and although I loved how practical they are for carrying around and such they always break. So Im switching over to actual headphones over the ears.  Preferred tonal balance  This is tough for me. Im really not an expert when it comes to audio. Id say I like bass for sure but theres no need for it to be so overpowering that I cant hear anything else. Im using them purely for enjoyment purposes no professional sound mixing or anything so theres no need for them to be  neutral and what not. I suppose its better if I state some more in the music I listen to part. Past headphones  I used a bunch of relatively bad IEMs before getting Monster Turbine IEMs. They were good but they broke rather quickly. As for an actual over the ear thing Ive used Creative Fatality headphones for ages. Partially for gaming which the new headphones should also be alright for but also to listen music on. They finally broke after about  years now as only  side still works. I was happy with them but they werent anything special. Preferred Music  I listen to a rather wide variety of stuff. High on my list is Drum amp Bass deep house but also stuff that I dont really know how to classify like the XX. I suppose these are on very different ends of the spectrum but I also occasionally listen to Metal such as Rise Against and underground HipHop. This is very vague I guess. Some typical songs that I would listen to Location  This is a bit difficult but I guess actually convenient. I currently live in Switzerland but I have family that I regularly visit in the Netherlands. More importantly I have contacts that make trips back and forth to the USA on a regular basis so I can order in the USA without any issues.Now this isnt in the format and Im not sure if it is appreciated or not at all but maybe some general info. Ive never been an expert on music or sound quality but I feel like its time after destroying many IEMs and using a gaming headset for many years to invest a little and get some good sounding headphones. Ill wear them quite a few hours a day usually so they should be comfortable. Id like to carry them around to school but I suppose theres only so much one can ask for so great carrying capabilities are no real priority. I dont have any idea about how tonal preferences work I tried looking stuff up but I can only guess. The above music preferences might give some indication but as I change my mind on what type of music I like rather often it doesnt make too much sense to heavily focus on one genre. Bass is there to stay but yeah its not the only thing I care about. For the rest I do play games on my PC but they dont need to be geared towards this specifically. I have a separate microphone so thats fine. So far people have recommended the DT   Ohms the Creative Aurvana Live the ATH Ms and the KRK KNS. Id love opinions on these with respect to my criteria or just other recommendations entirely.,headphones,cl6h2dt,1,t5_2rcyx

Hes usually known for mellow folk rock music that has a very distinctive indie sound to it. But with this album theres been a touch of electronic influence. Synthesizers pop up every now and then. Additionally it has some ethnic flavor. Banhart himself spent part of his childhood in Venezuela and he can go from singing Spanish to German then back to English.  Speaking of ethnic I should also add Fatoumata Diawara as well. Hailing from the African country Mali her music falls under the umbrellagenre world music. But there are Western influences. It can get quite jazzy at times.Also its mastered very very well and is a fantastic benchmark for acoustic instruments and percussion. Its one of the best albums I have in my library productionwise.,headphones,clrf04n,3,t5_2rcyx

2293323,0,t1_cluiblt,The sinc function is used in the reconstruction filter for DACs.  It is indeed the ideal shape for this filter for DISCRETE functions i.e. PCM Digital music.  The ringing that goes out to infinity at both sides has a frequency that is related to the sampling frequency.  As you convolve the sinc function over each sample point they experience constructive and destructive interference and more or less cancel out. As the intervals between the samples gets smaller and smaller i.e. the sampling frequency gets higher the sinc narrows and the ringing increases its frequency.  As the interval between samples gets infinitesimal i.e. take the limit at the interval goes to zero you transfer over from a discrete function to a continuous one.  What happens to the sinc function? its ringing frequency approaches infinity and the bandwidth of the main spike and the ringing become infinitesimal and the sinc function becomes a delta function.  So in short just as the sinc function is the perfect response for a low pass filter for discrete functions so too is the delta function which has infinitesimally small ringing the ideal function to convolve with a continuous signal.  Your points a are valid and really i am starting to believe that the impulse function cannot be analyzed by just looking at it your main point if im not mistaken but showing impulse responses for an entirely different kind of linear system is misleading.  Now whether or not a delta function is the perfect impulse response for a pair of headphones i kind of dont think so.  I think a delta function would result in unity gain across an infinite bandwidth something surely headphones dont do and is not necessarily desirable. WRT the fact that technically all sampled data is discrete this is true but you are sampling a continuous system.  if you say had a sample rate of  khz and really you are only limited by your equipment here incredibly high sample rates are possible your measurements would not yield any data above  khza s you say but the behavior of the system would be that of a continuous system just minus anything over  khz. ,headphones,clv662u,1,t5_2rcyx

The problem with newer games is that they have bass heavy sound effects to start with and trying to play with constant bass rumbling from explosions and gunshots gives me a headache. Which is why I dont game with my XB the bass resonance would crack my skull But keep in mind that while situational positioning is an advantage it is not the biggest factor associated with playing FPS games well. What I mean is that if you suck at FPS games in general improved soundstage is not going to make you into a superstar all of a sudden. All it does is give you an extra few  of positional advantage and if you believe that you really need that small extra boost to get to your desired level of gaming then by all means pick a pair of headphones with uberwide soundstage that would be the Q,headphones,cm052or,1,t5_2rcyx

So for example all other components being equal I cant tell the difference between ODAC and Modi. But the Fiio E sounds modestly warmer than the ODAC but that may be discrimination bias on the part of the observer me and my Cambridge Audio DAC Magic  sounds audibly warmer than the ODAC which is a real difference because thats how it was tuned by design. My Micromega MyDAC sounds brighter than most which again IMO is audible. The reason I picked these particular dacs is because they are all sigma delta and represent a gradient in sound away from transparency. I did not consider price in the equation.The real difference in sound is when you change the DAC chip to a different architecture. For example NOS DACs sound very different than sigma delta dacs. So if you are thinking of getting a different sounding dac consider a NOS dac for example a metrum The one I have is a Project Dac S FL. It is very warm and analogey sounding significantly different than any of my sigma deltas.,headphones,cm83vom,1,t5_2rcyx

This can be explained with a better sealdenser pads as less energy loss results in a higher efficiency. Also an increased impedance can occur when some of that retained energy dampens the driver and results in increased electrical resistance. However I do agree with you that the drivers are different but the pads are a big part of the equation. A lower THD in the bass cant be explained by pads.

People say you need an amp with the AKG  series but I honestly havent noticed THAT much of a difference between using an amp and using my xfi but I havent done a blind test so I cant really be sure. I tried to compare it myself and sometimes I was convinced it was worse with just the soundcard but other times I really couldnt tell. It could definitely get loud enough with the soundcard although the issue with the K series is that they require a lot of current at low frequencies so you could have a source that makes them loud enough but isnt able to provide enough current to bring the low frequencies up to the correct volume making them seem like they dont have much bass which definitely isnt the case when properly amped. ,headphones,cminrs2,1,t5_2rcyx

2519724,0,t3_2ohh9n,Well Ive had mine for  months and have been very satisfied overall.  Ive listened to them in a library while walking outside and during car rides.  Because the isolation is not great the biggest issue in a library is obviously leakage.  That    volume mark on a phone is about as high as u can go which is plenty sufficient for a quiet library.  I will caution you though.  When I listen in the car the low frequency noise of the highway compromises the sound of the headphones at least in my opinion.  The bass became much less noticeable even at high volumes.   I have no direct comparison to IEMs but I can pretty much guarantee IEMs would isolate better.  Bottom line its a delicate balance between isolation and sound leakage.  For blocking out voices and commotion theyll do the job but on any motorized form of transportation I think youll be less satisfied if youll be traveling on any highways.

2586063,0,t1_cmw4nov,Oh yeah. Im not sure its completely necessary. Between using the mixamp and just my computers sound card there is no noticeable degradation of audio qualitystatic. I may just run it as planned without a DAC for PS unless there is a significant difference in using the DAC. I have an older mixamp that is regarded as being one of the better ones when talking about extra noise or lack thereof. Edit I was just testing out the Dolby Surround Sound on the PS and it seemed to actually make it harder to pinpoint directional cues with it off I could hear a very direct sound for a plane flying over audible in either the left or right ear depending on its location and with Dolby surround sound on it made the sound equal throughout both ears and made it difficult to pinpoint the sound to one direction. This however may not be working as intended as Im using the ATH Ms and such issues could be attributed to the lack of sound stage. Regardless of the Dolby sound I am in favor of using the mixamp just to send computer audio to my cans at the same time as the PS for Ventrilo and music. ,headphones,cmw4wyx,1,t5_2rcyx

2628208,0,t1_cn0hkdn,I have to ask what do you mean by PC with optical and USB? On the top of my head I dont know of any amps that run from an optical or usb to the amp that doesnt have a DAC because an amplifier amplifies analog signal only while a DAC converts the digital signal to analog so the headphone can react to the electricity going into it.Ill put it this way. If youre running this from a soundcard then get a magni  and be done with it. Unless you plan on going to the higherend of midtier dynamics and planars you wont need any more than that. Heck if you have a soundcard you dont even need a DAC technically. The reason people get DACs is because it allows more data to go to the headphones than without. Motherboard DACs are avoided due to the amount of distortion and noise it causes. Most people bypass this with a sound card and audiophiles get a DAC when they want something better. This is actually why people say a DAC is needed but is usually the LAST thing you should get.I could go on to why people hype up amps and dacs and why people make the choices they do but that would be silly in this topic.  Ill just say amps are needed to get the full sound out of most headphones since volume  correct amount of power.,headphones,cn1n4jv,1,t5_2rcyx

Soundwise the LP are much bassier warmer in the mids and harsherpeakier in the treble rolling off sharply after kHz. The Mx has a flatter midrange which will give instruments and vocals a more realistic and less coloured timbre and a smoother more natural treble with better high frequency extension. If you want big bass though the LP is probably the way to go.Also check outNVX XPTBrainwavz HMFischer FA all the same headphone very neutral.

2863094,0,t1_cnth6ga,If Im dodging the thrust of your argument its because your argument cannot be argued against  I can hear a difference! No you cant Yes I can  discussion cannot progress beyond that.gt Now each of them have bass that sounds noticeably different from one another. Please enlighten the world.  Use your golden ears to characterize the difference and please also do a doubleblind test and have a third party administer it and publish the results.  gt It is not a nightandday difference Im sure a lot of selfproclaimed audiophiles or particle physicists who dont have enough listening experience would not notice it.Mod or not you can take your ad hominem elsewhere.  This was a civil discussion and Im not even a particle physicist. gt Like the measurements might indicate they both give me about the same bass volume once I match levels.How are you matching levels within your ear canal?  Minute changes in sealing can alter the bass response considerably and it is very easy to lose the seal and thus lose all bass altogether.   Mathematically matching the output is not equivalent inside your ear canals.  Further than that when the space the driver is coupled to is barely cm tiny tiny differences in positioning will alter the SPL presented to the ear.  The rolloff on both of those IEMs can be attributed as much to the test itself as it can be to the design of the headphone.  Even with far less sensitive open headphones this is evident  different LCD headphones have different quantities of bass.Take for example this LCD dB of missmatch below Hz.  This is due to differences in the seal and placement not the drivers being mismatched.  Or The same headphone with some small plastic waveguides and suddenly the bass is down dB.  This is once again sealing related.  The same driver same magnets same everything but some small plastic and invisibletothosefrequencies structures caused the bass to drop dB?  Nope placement changes did.gt But they both have a different and unique character to their bass renditions.Step  check the signal chain.  Are they plugged into a lowZ amp?  With the impedance of one of them being about ohms at low frequencies and the other being about  any amp over about  ohms this is a number that leans heavily in your favor will not control the drivers the same way.Step  realize that measurements under Hz or another arbitrary frequency with IEMs do not speak directly to the performance or linearity of that IEM the output is too sensitive to sealing.  This is the same as measurements near the resonant frequencies of the human ear the HRTF of the dummy and you may not match so with compensation the two are not crosscompatible.  Step  Realize that one of these headphones has a clean impulse and shows good damping  about ms  while the other has a nasty double peak and takes about ms to damp.  This is not even a low frequency signal with strong driver movements at lower frequencies the transient speed would be far more slowed down as the drivers exert.  In the relevant range there is also a difference in THD of about  which must be considered and is not dependent on the driver type.gt Would you chaulk up the differences to the wavefront stuff?No for two reasons The shape of a wavefront isnt really something your ear can detect at low frequencies because the wavelength is too long to develop a sense of the shape of the wave as it passes you IEMs have many reflections in small corridors as the sound travels from the driver to the edge of the bore.  These will greatly convolute the original wavefront.gt lol go and tell that to any audio researcher out there and theyll laugh at your face.I have friends who do research in audio.  Aside from psychoacoustics and research re the ear itself the ear is not a valid measurement tool because its results are not quantitative.  You said you were an EE  did you ever do any kind of research at all?  Senses are not valid research tools.  Research is done with measurements and correlated with listening in development.  gt Go and tell that to any studio musician or audio engineer and theyll laugh at you.These are not scientific scenarios they are musical.  gt It is a completely valid tool to judge all sorts of phenomena.Judge  do scientific testing.You seem hellbent to convince everyone?  yourself? that I do not know what I talk about.

I asked my dad who is an insane audiophile and who is also really tech savvy and he laughed when I showed him smart headphones. I personally dont think the ones coming out are the future.

3180034,0,t3_2wk9h9,Strictly speaking it isnt a  ohm amp the impedance is wholly a property of the headphones the amp will have output impedance as well but that is not what they are talking about here it just means that they estimate it will be able to drive a typical  ohm headphone to reasonable levels. However impedance isnt really the important measurement here sensitivity is. Impedance just relates current and voltage but says nothing about how much sound you get out of the headphones. Headphones with a low sensitivity will need more voltage or current to reach a given sound level depending on if they give sensitivity in terms of voltage or current. ,headphones,corly5z,2,t5_2rcyx

But . does give you frontback separation not available in stereo.Most of the practical issues I see with it actually have nothing to do with virtual surround but with the games themselves having limits on the maximum simultaneous sounds which leads to some sounds not being played.

Because everyone says they are good...Dont get me wrong I have two mechanical keyboards used to have the old school ones when it was current tech and have tried everything in between.Mechanical keyboards are nice but not because they are mechanical because they have more travel the key movement feels better and in some cases they move more smoother or they make a nice physical sound.Id say for gaming I much prefer mechanical keyboards they are a lot better to use I feel I am much more in control. For typing and programming however the mac keyboard I think is one of the best.Even look at the new Microsoft ergo keyboard they use similar buttons to that of mac and if it wasnt for the function keys and poorish mac integration I would be using one of them myself.But mechanical keyboards are now very much a status designer symbol rather than a requirement for a good typing device. Just look at all the keyboards now with crazy colors and missing half the buttons to make them smaller... these arent practical not really at all. Hell my happy hacking keyboard I bought so I could keep in my bag and take between computers which had no keyboard not for any other reason now folk are buying them and then complaining why they dont have arrows or why they need three keys to get access to normal keys lol.,headphones,coxs7wl,1,t5_2rcyx

After doing a bit of research here I finally decided to take the next step into the audiophile world by ordering a pair of Ms. The only thing Im worried about with that purchase is the bass situation. While I was researching I saw a lot of different opinions about how much bass youd actually get out of them. Some say plenty some say theyre neutral.My most recent and decent pair of cans before this were BoseQC and I was really happy with the amount of bass I got from those. Then again my only other headphones beforehand were Studio Beats and standard Apple headphones. I just want to know if I should expect less about the same amount or more bass from the Ms as opposed to the QCs.Hopefully its okay to post this here.

3690071,0,t1_cqcvay1,Oh sweet an opportunity to enter a debate in a calm matter. Lets do this.I am inclined to believe you on the fact that you may have paid for your own trip ect ect. However you are part of a business and you need to make money. How do you make money? By sponsorships.Sure you can fly out there and pick up the headphone. But you may not be telling the complete truth here. Business trips like yours to Blue can form a network or partnerships that can make you money. Before and after your review however ads for the headphone ran for months. That makes you ad money which is how you make profit out of the website. A lot of us here joke around about your reviews being infomercials in jest but were not stupid. Were well aware you make money off ads.Lets take the Blue MoFi example which is the one Ive seen joked about the most and I myself use from time to time. If you look on my submitted topics half a year or more ago youd see I did a review on them after doing a lot of research on them. I even watched your review which made me think this didnt give me much information about the sound but Ill try it out for the hell of it. And I did like the sound. For the price just based on the sound it is probably one of the best buys in the audio world until the PM came out recently. It had a sound that did what the Mad Dog aims to do but better. However I returned it because it was so damn uncomfortable that I could only wear it for  minutes at a time.Tying this to your review this was the one thing you talked about consistently. Rarely did you mention the actually sound quality of the headphone and instead tried hammering in its unique selling feature that was also its major weakness. You literally distracted the viewer by bringing to attention how comfortable it was over and over again while showing us the factory and how it was madebrought together but you never actually went into the sound of the headphone in any amount of sufficient detail. People joked that you went on and on about comfort but never put on the headphone for any length of time and instead went on about neckability. It was painfully obvious that it was sounding like an infomercial.The comfort you kept raving about was not the strong suit of this headphone. It was too heavy too convoluted  and had way too much clamp. All the weight of the headphone was beating down a very small piece of foam on the top of the headphone. Hell it didnt even open enough for my head and I had the metal sides burrowing into my temples it was really just pressing on them lightly but it maddening how annoying that is. You almost never hear about the headphone after it came out unless its the picture on your ads trying to get us to buy it.I would have agreed with your analysis of the sound of there was a concrete one. You never mentioned the bass being almostplanar like while being linear with the mids. The headphones highs being the one weakness since they tended to be spikes but dark enough to overlook. You briefly mentioned the amp but not how it was useful for phones and lowpowered devices but the headphone sounded best out of an amp. I got none of that from your review.Instead like most of us joke about we got an infomercial and months of Blue MoFi ads on site. Every review is infomerciallike. Im not even going to go into the shit people talk about outside the infomercials that keep them away from headfi.Again dont take this personally. I know youre in a business to make money but we arent stupid. A lot of us know how you get revenue from the site. Its not a secret.,headphones,cqcw4zw,5,t5_2rcyx

Source Mainly laptop and mobile device Samsung Galaxy SIII but also CDplayer. Isolation Not too much leakage as I also want to be able to listen in public locations such as trainbus or work place. Preferred type of headphone Overear with removable cable and portable. Good loud enough volume to be used with mobile device without having to put the volume on  before hearing it well though Im not a highvolume listener just to spare power of my phone and without the need of an amp. Preferred tonal balance WarmneutralVshaped. Im new to these terms so Im not entirely sure. At least I want the bass to be good not weak but also not exaggerated!!! So not the basshead type but it has to be there nonetheless. But Id just like an overall good sound in which people dont complain about a lack of impact of the bass. Preferred music Many types of rock like progressive newwavepostpunk postrock some psychedelic and triphop.  Some of my favourite artists are The Church Gazpacho David Sylvian Talk Talk Marillion VAST Massive Attack Godspeed You! Black Emperor The Cure The Blue Nile Pink Floyd Arcade Fire debut album Talking Heads Archive.Oh and by the way if this is useful to somebody the hight of my ears is  mm and the width  mm.

I have read up and watched videos on a few IEMs and have narrowed down my choices to the following IEMs   Sennheiser Momentum HiFiMan RE VSonic GR Bass Edition RHA MA Yamaha EPH Edit Too large for my ear canals.Out of all of these I am leaning toward the VSonic GRs but Im not too fond of the aesthetics for the bass edition. Do any of the above sound similar to the GRATHMs? I was told the ATHMs have a Vshape. Also I have small ears. More info below thanks.

I also had some old  Sony earbuds but cannot remember the model. I like the sound of the ATHM and I dislike the Apple Earpods they hurt my ears after prolonged use.

3856150,0,t1_cqvtlxc,Off the record quotes especially without a source to back it up is worthless.Purrin and Changstar did have a bone to pick with HD. I dont know why but they hate it with a passion. I honestly couldnt care less if someone dislikes or even hates the HD. I just dont appreciate it when people keep spreading rumors and negativity or act like they know what theyre talking about based solely on the opinions of others and not on personal experiences.Everyone has their preferences and everyone hears things differently. There are people who dislike any and all headphones. Ive heard of complaints about HD being too analytical having too much treble mids and bass not being sufficient HD is very picky with amps etc. A lot of people have to resort to modding it to make it sound good. Thing is the same people who criticize HD harshly are also some of the biggest HD fanboys OJNeg for example who have modded the shit out of their HD and bought ridiculously expensive DACs and amps to make it sound amazing. People who actually own the HD all know that it requires a good amp that pairs well with it to sound its best... just like all highend headphones. Yet the same considerations and caveats applied to other highend headphones are not afforded to HD by their critics.As for your  original retail price comment I personally think that all highend headphones are extremely overpriced especially at their launch retail pricepoint. Manufacturers always set the original retail price at  the cost of production. Even after multiple price drops they still make a ridiculous amount of profit on each headphone sold. Thats why I generally wait a while to purchase headphones and IEMs. You dont want to be caught up in the hype or in HDs case the hate train. Its best to get proper feedback from the masses and to demo extensively than to rely on a select few sources. P.S. The HD hasnt been at  retail for nearly  years. ,headphones,cqvu4tq,3,t5_2rcyx

We are sending you a Modi  uber today via FedEx day with tracking number . Included in the package is a prepaid shipping label. Please repack the Magni  uber safely and securely and use this shipping label to ship it back to us. Please wrap the wallwart and place it under the Magni  uber so it will not inflict any damage in transit. I have issued a refund for your upgraded Saturday delivery shipping cost.And you saidgt I feel like thats pretty unacceptable considering the massive delay and that my order paid for  day shipping already which I did NOT receive.... especially after I had to go through the deal of upgrading my shipping to actually get it in  days.AndgtThis is entirely on you guys and you havent offered a single thing to make up for it. This highly disheartening for a repeat customer who has always purchased through your Amazon storefront before. I have been a Schiit Audio evangelist to my friends. Thats because I was such a fan of my original modi and magni. This experience is definitely a major disappointment to me.Then they saidgtIm sorry but you will not be receiving a phone call. All support is only offered through email.It is not true that we have not offered a single thing to make up for this. We have attempted to make this right by you but you are not satisfied with what we are offering. There is a difference.Seriously I can go on a bit more but the reason why your post is downvoted is because you made the situation bigger than it really is and youre forcing them to own up to them even if they already have with day shipping for your correct product the Modi  refunded shipping. What else do you want? A  gift card and a coupon? But really I think youre acting like a big baby. People make mistakes all the time and I think Schiit has gone a few steps to remedy that.In an extreme situationin which I dont think Jason would allow to do to begin with what if you keep pushing the situation and complain about it to no end. Then someone might be punished because you just cant get your Modi fast enough and its ruining your life.

4025722,0,t3_36m62c,My recommendation this week is Sufjan Stevens album Michigan. I wouldnt normally recommend this album during the warmer months because it gives off cold Winter vibe but Ive been listening to it a lot lately.There are a few things worth noting about this album the first is that this album was recorded with so many disadvantages and mistakes that it should not sound as good as it does. Sufjan used  mics two being a Shure SM vocal mic to record everything including the drums. Secondly Sufjan recorded each part by himself and manually lined everything up in Pro Tools. Lastly Sufjan was running out of space so he lowered the sample rate to k instead of the standard k. This album doesnt sound as lofi as it should infact it sort of glazes over the music and smooths it out and adds to the Winter vibe of it. Its a dense album that doesnt come off as congested and its mixed very well. It wont bring your system to life but it surprisingly sounds very good.Sufjan Stevens  Detroit Lift Up Your Weary Head,headphones,crf5u9p,0,t5_2rcyx

4059551,0,t1_criy3tk,Im actually using the stock pads right now. What I think might be causing the heat up and itchiness is the clamping force from the headband pressing the ear pads onto your ears with more force than necessary. Before I even listened to them for the first time I stressed out the head band a bit to relieve the clamping pressure and I havent had a problem with em since. I recommend gradually bending them till they just lightly but securely sit on the ear. They dont feel loose to me but they arent vice grips either.

If you dont understand how the wires should run taking a pic of the insides BEFORE you cutstripsolder is likely to help. Also if youre forgetful it will help a lot when putting it back together.. a good soldering iron with a THIN tip is a must for this kind of work.That being said lets go over some possibilities. I cant see where the redbluecopper wires go at the bottom of the pic but assuming they run into the .mm plug dongle. If thats the case it might be red  right channel blue  left and copper  common ground but Ive seen all kinds of random variations. You seem to have a giant glob of solder with multiple wires going in are you sure youre not shorting one of the drivers?

4276166,0,t3_39xiir,Heres the blog entry with the companys writeup on the new DACAmplifier gt JDS Labs has worked tirelessly to share this day with fellow headphone enthusiasts. We are proud to introduce The Element.gt We designed The Element to enjoy our headphones without compromise. Its amplifier renders shocking power driven by an ultra clean DAC all housed in a precision machined chassis with a comfortable knob. The Element beautifully drives headphones of all technologies and sizes.gt  Availabilitygt The Element is available for Preorder via JDS Labs. The first batch will ship by June th.gt Mass production began six weeks ago and is now complete pending final assembly engraving quality control and packaging. Accessories are in transit with expected arrival later this week. Well share updates here as well as on the item page.gt  Design Motivationgt Each project weve embarked upon in the past eight years has been a step towards a better listening experience. The cMoyBB delivers better bass. NwAvGuys Objective and ODAC projects invigorated the headphone community in  inviting disruptive leaps in headphone ampDAC performance. While our manufacturing efforts have helped propel O to its  Desktop Amp community rating at HeadFi.org everyone recognizes the glaring problem with O. Its ugly. The mechanical design was an afterthoughta bare minimum solution to put the circuit in a box.gt Years before JDS Labs I often browsed impressive HiFi systems that I either could not afford or lacked the resources to skillfully assemble. The average DIY amp in the early s demanded access to a machinist and of course basic mechanical and electrical assembly knowledge. Whether commercial or DIY a well designed enclosure is a work of art.gt The Element places equal emphasis on external and internal design. We began with an ergonomic volume knob size and position commonly found in pro gear then designed an enclosure to accommodate the knob and very last created the amplifier and DAC to fit the enclosure.gt  On Pushing Boundariesgt Some of our competitors have scoffed in disbelief that a niche audio company can sustainably build a product like The Element. Weve heard that its priced too low. Weve heard that our volumes need to be in the millions. Weve heard that well ultimately fail and give up.gt We thoroughly understand the pressures. The Element is an insane mechanical designto most. One impressed applications engineer described our initial concept of The Element as This is the way it should be. Let the design test the limits of the machines and the machinists.gt The Elements contoured chassis requires six sided machining plus three machining processes for its volume knob another operation for its custom buttons as well as injection molding for its soft bottom surface. These requirements were beyond the capabilities of our single CNC in early . Contract shops quoted labor costs that would have doubled The Elements target price. Its simply not feasible while following ordinary suppliermanufacturer business models.gt So we made a judgement call last year. Rather than dismiss our vision we chose to do what weve done best since . Our head manufacturing engineer Nick retooled the company and developed a viable inhouse production process for The Element. Our machine shop now generates truckloads of locally recyclable aluminum chips. More on this another day.gt  Circuitrygt Prototypes of The Element have been on my home and office desks for months and I cannot stop smiling as it drives a set of Audeze LCDXCs.gt The enclosure was merely our starting point. As with the exterior design we set strict performance standards of transparency and tremendous output power.gt  Amplificationgt Linear regulators provide VDC to clean LME buffer amplification stages with peak output power in excess of .W at  ohms. The Element drives all balanced armature dynamic and planar magnetic headphones with ease. A inch volume knob and and dual gain levels make fine level adjustments possible.gt  DigitaltoAnalog Conversiongt The Element processes digital audio through an SA controller and PCMA DAC. While the PCMA supports bit kHz audio weve intentionally selected a UAC controller for maximum software and OS compatibility. DSD and bit driver support remain unjustified. Quantization error of bit audio yields a theoretical dynamic range of dB several orders of magnitude beyond an audibly ideal dynamic range of gtdB. In other words we value a clean implementation and real world performance over a superfluous featureset.gt  Tactile Buttons and Logical Relaysgt We also designed The Element to interact as nicely as it looks and sounds. Custom tactile buttons control power and dual gain functions. An onboard microcontroller operates failsafe relays which mute the output for ms during startup and shutdown producing headphone silence no DC offset pops or thumps.gt  Benchmark Performancegt The Element was a mess in early prototyping! We started from scratch three times and produced over  development revisions of the PCB to achieve desired transparency power and functionality. That said well keep the technical discussion to a minimum. Know that the following specification tables are backed by the same test procedures as other JDS Labs products and Objective series designs.gt All benchmarks are conducted on our Prism dScope Series III Audio Analyzer. Certain tests require additional data from a Tektronix MHz digital oscilloscope or Fluke .gt Max Continuous Output Power is conservatively measured at kHz with THDN below . for  minutes of sine wave output. This endurance test places great stress on any amplifier. Many amps including O overheat during extended  ohm sine tests THD skyrockets and ICs may incur damage. The Element runs stable.gt The Peak Output Power test demonstrates the highest power observed under the same conditions for less than  seconds. This approach gives a better view of the amplifiers capability during real world usage.gt The Element performs well in all areas low noise low output impedance low harmonic and intermodulation distortion and high output power.gt  Amplifier Performancegt  Frequency Response HzkHz  . dBgt  THDN  kHz  O .gt  IMD CCIF kHz  O .gt  IMD SMPTE  O .gt  Noise AWeighted  dBugt  Crosstalk   O  dBgt  Output Impedance .

It will still increase the productionprice of the product. It could even be that it HAS to be paid upfront for each batch who knows what deal they have. If a company doesnt market their product properly no one ends up buying it which translates in a lower scale production thus higher prices. A larger a companyproduction has way more financial headroom than a small person company. And the only way to become big or get a product populair is with a large marketing budget most of the timeIt seems narrow minded to judge a company just buy its marketing budget maybe they waste way more money on other stuff Think beautiful HQs overpaid managers going green maximising investor payouts research in unrelated products or whatever. All very hard to judge without going balls deep the companys books.I dont mind companies amp products like Beats they see an easy market media brainwashed sheep and they take advantage of it. I would do the same if I was in their position. I just cant wrap my head around the fact that there are still so many people in the lower and middle class that cant be bothered to hit up some reviews before making such a purchase.

4432518,0,t1_cspdxy4,Ahh here were my notes on bothgtThe closest headphone in terms of sound I have to the Rx is my beloved Sony MDRMA. Both have polite slightly mellow and warm sound signatures and both are excellent all rounders. But the Rx differs from the MA because it has much tighter more controlled bass. The very lowest frequencies are much less rolled off and everything sounds more solid. The treble is also slightly more defined and forward compared to the MA and the mids dont sound as nasal as they can sometimes sound with the MA.gtBasically if you like the MA youll love the Rx. I think of it as the most logical step up from the MA with a tighter more cohesive sound and almost but not quite the same level of wearing comfort.As far as music I made this semirepresentative Spotify playlistIt doesnt have a lot of the anime  game soundtracks or other obscure things I like though.,headphones,cspeo9r,1,t5_2rcyx

4529355,0,t1_ct1bk89,The Hyper X cloud is much better than the any Logitech headset. When it comes to the MkI vs the MkII there are actually some improvements but they are not worth the additional costs for the the new version. The MkI is your regular headset that terminates in two mm stereo jacks greenpink for mic and sound. And directly plugs into your motherboard. The MkII terminates in a single TRRS mm cable that means Mic and sound via one jack like your phone IEMs with an inline microphone. In addition the MkII comes with a virtual surround . USB sound dock where you plug in the headphone.Now the Hyper X Cloud headset is based on the Chinese headphone Takstar PRO and different companies simply slap their logos on the back plate and markup the price by  e.g. the QPAD headsets. The headphone itself is a clone of the highly recommended original German Beyerdynamic DT Since the Takstar PRO is a stereo headphone it will perform the most natural way if you use it as such and therefore the MkII is just a marketing stunt to profit from gamers who dont know any better.

Though theyre stock pads are pretty unbearable I think they might interest you.do you want a bit more midbass kick a greater thumping sensation in basslines and kick drums around Hz? If youre looking for something with tight and powerful bass response neither the MX nor the ADX are known to deliver that. The Sound signature of the Bose soundtrue is the one with the more bass response amongst the three headphones you have.

I doubt there are many people who would say either of Kendrick Lamars two latest albums sound bad but their DR indicates it should on some level DR indicates compression but mastering is far more important to an extent than DR. The only one thats showing as acceptable is a vinyl rip which is pretty useless information due to a number of reasons Ill touch on if youd like.A lot of people like to counter that DR will at least show which version of which release will have the least compression. My retort is Who gives a crap? By this I mean for an album like Dark Side of the Moon there have been hundreds of versions no Im not kidding. Many different masterings have been done and DR wont tell you which one youre going to like best as each has their own tuning that may be preferable to some despite a lower DR.Those numbers are practically useless use your ears.Edit If this doesnt make full sense I just woke up but you guys get the gist.,headphones,ct7ma15,1,t5_2rcyx

4603200,0,t3_3e24ig,Hey everyone. Im looking to buy a nice pair of headphones for my PC. They will mostly be used for gaming as well as general use and music use also. Preferably with a microphone although I have a desk mic my friends all say its quite annoying when I use it as any vibrations through the desk also hit the mic. Budget  Around Source  PC. Primarily gamingRequirements for Isolation  Mostly being used at home isolation could be nice but not essential by any meansPreferred Type of Headphone  Full sizedPreferred tonal balance  I mostly enjoy rock and enjoy having a bit more bass. But I am flexiblePast headphones  Current PC headphones are Ozone Rage ST. I like the comfort they offer I never notice them when I wear them even though I have a fairly large head. Sound quality is fairly mediocre. Build quality is also mediocre plasticy and no reinforcement at the jack end where it is starting to break. My pair before that were Sennheiser HD s. I liked their sound but they felt a bit tight on my head and ears.Preferred Music  Primarily rock but I go as light as AltJ and as heavy as SOAD and Killswitch Engage. I also enjoy listening to film OSTsWhat would you like to improve on from your setup  My current headphones are dying and I need new ones I thought I would have a big upgrade. My current ones are comfortable but I would like better overall build and sound quality. I have fairly large ears and a large head so comfort is a big factor.I have been looking at  both the Monster DNA pro . and also the Sennheiser PCD but I would say that the DNA pros are the very very upper limit of my budget and would only go that high if something was said to be superb.

4672337,0,t1_ctjhps3,Nice. I have DTs for my closed back set and nothing for open back yet! Am thinking of getting something like the ZMF x Virbo instead of an open back because I like a bit of isolation.True but you do have to remember that balanced armatures have better isolation than dynamics almost always since they dont have any vents! Also the IEs are well not very isolating with stock tips. Isolation is about on par with the vented FX imo. For pure isolation OP would be much better off with a set of Westones Shures or ATHIMx IEMs. I suppose they have a good midrange but it didnt really stand out to me when I tried them last. No Ts are extremely bass heavy and IEs are a bit less bassy but still far north of neutral.Hmm which ones have you tried? The Astrotec AX are a bit underwhelming but the Dunus.

They sound very clean not sibilant at all. The level of detail you hear can probably only be surpassed by its older brothers the er series but many people find them too analytical. Also the isolation you get with the default triple flange tips is probably the best you can get from non custom tips. Heck I find it hard to believe any tips could provide better isolation than these.

4796736,0,t3_3glfjp, In Ear Monitors like the FiiO you mentioned they are actually DUNU Titans have a silicone or foam tip that is inserted into your ear canal. Earbuds like the Baldoor E just sit above of your antitragus and outer conch.In ear Monitors provide very good isolation because when they are inserted correctly and completely seal the ear canal almost no outside noise can be heard. Some IEMs have up to dB broadband isolation. Some highend manufacturers even offer to build custom housings that match an imprint of your earEarbuds dont isolate as well as IEMs and dont fit as securely as IEMs especially the Baldoor is a bitch. The advantage of earbuds is that it is comfortable over a very long time whereas many IEM users experience discomfort after prolonged usage.

First it isnt as heavy the SL enclosure although its gorgeous enough isnt as beefy as the regular Soloist which has this Applelike machined aluminum shell.Second and probably most noticeably the SL has an ALPS pot like any other amp instead of the stepped attenuator that the Soloist has.Third the SL delivers  WPC at  ohms compared to the Soloists Lyresque  WPC.And to round out the differences the SL does not have RCA outs so cant serve as a preamp for your main rig and has only  gain settings in contrast to .Having said that the SL is no slouch when it comes to delivering the audio goods. If I had to describe it in a word I would say natural. Vocals and instruments sound rich and treble is crisp which IMO sums up the Burson house sound rather well.The SL pairs very well with Audeze and certainly has the power to handle most planars. Some folks dont like the Burson  HD pairing because the combo veers too much into bright territory but it pairs well with the  and especially the . Im not a huge fan of coupling it with most AKG headphones because the treble sounds even more plasticky and unnatural. Soloist SL  Beyer T DT can be a fatiguing combination.The Soloist is one of my favorite headphones amps but its usual price of  may be too rich for some folks. The SL is a reasonable compromise for those who desire Burson sound but cant afford or dont want to own the Soloist or Conductor.

I have shortlisted to BampW C S and the new jaybird xs. I love EDMHipHop and I occasionally listen to Indie. I like music while working out too. I am a big fan of clarity and noise isolation but wouldnt mind slightly prominent bass.If you guys have any other suggestions I am open minded  if not help me decide between the two listed above.Thanks a ton for your responses!,headphones,curmprr,2,t5_2rcyx

Ive asked several times why youre making these criticisms without any response from you.  This is proof.gt The only thing I expressed in my first comment was that Im surprised that you feel plush toys are more familiar to headphone enthusiasts than actual headphone pads.I dont feel this way and Ive already expressed this to you and told you why I made the analogy in the first place.  You are in denial.gt You still seem to be mixing up comparisons and analogies. If it feels like carnival toy stuffing then you are making a comparison not an analogy.Analogy  a comparison between two things typically on the basis of their structure and for the purpose of explanation or clarification. googleAnalogy  a similarity between like features of two things on which a comparison may be based dictionary.comYour criticisms are empty and pointless.gt Considering the fact that your intent was unclear enough for us to be having this entirely too involved discussion it would appear that your comparison was unhelpful.No youve simply proven that your mind is incapable of comprehending simple ideas.gt Its not a big deal and you dont need to get so worked up about it.Your criticisms are baseless and ridiculous.

5068505,0,t3_3kap0a,My story short version.I started a new job as a stageman for a local Livemusic company.I learned all the necessary things about sound soundquality and how to connect it all and so on.After  years working as a stagesound builder and beeing on tours with some semi big names the company announced that wed open a new section.Indoor sound permanently mounted. So I was chosen to be in charge of the section and thats where things went out of hand.I was AMAZED by how much better I could make things sound in a closed environment read Not live environment.Alot of the times myour customers said make it sound good cost is not a problem. So I started to go crazy. Alot of custom jobs alot of custom speakers were built by myself and my team of  others.The ONE job that REALLY made me love headphones headphone amps and the beautiful art that is DACs was a local Recordlabel.They had heard of me and the quality of the installments that ive made so they reached out and wanted us to build their new Studio.This was to me the coolest thing ever. Ive always had a talent of singing and playing various instruments hell im even signed with a label.SO I started sketching on their studio once I recieved the blueprints of the location.First sketch I turned in and the company asked me One question How much is it going to cost?Me around  dollars.They Double it. Go crazy.At this point I was so confused. In my mind I had already built the optimal studio.Well I was wrong. So a year later the build was finished. Oh they also wanted a reference corner. So we built a separate part of the area to be completely silent as silent as you can go with normal means.The headphone section was incredible. I spent hours upon hours just listening to differences in headphones amps and dacs.And thats where I realized I need this EVERYDAY EVERYWHERE.,headphones,cuwy2pd,1,t5_2rcyx

I am not that careful with pens so I get covered in pen ink even with a ballpoint when I get board I sometimes take the felt out of felt tip pens and draw with that and then Im stained for a week and I tried fountain pens once when I was a lot less mature and the same thing happened.

5286607,1,t3_3nerds,HEi Heard them and didnt care for them. Small soundstageclaustrophobic. Thought the older HEs sounded much better overall more natural. I felt the i sounded artificial to me on some recordings. Just my opinion but they are easily my least favorite HiFiMan headphone I have heard so far.HES Havent heard them yet but from what Ive been reading people say they are a less refined HEi. Also a lot of people are drawing comparisons to the HD but saying the HD have the better mids. Since I own the HD and like nice mids I have no interest in the HES at this point but would like to try them anyway.HE Bass bass bass. Some of the best bass out there today. Can be sibilant at times especially with female vocals I have found. Comfort is a step back from the other . HiFiMan made a mess with the naming. The i and S sound more like a HE than a HE and they also bring more disappointing bass to table compared to the HE. The HE has a great soundstage that can be made even better with a few simple mods. I would consider the HE the least versatile of the three but are amazing with EDM and well recorded jazz music.,headphones,cvnfcr8,1,t5_2rcyx

Compared to other pairs of headphones these dont benefit much from an amp. And there are other great pairs beyond the Ms but that doesnt mean that the Ms arent worth it in fact theyre a pair you cant go wrong with but being closebacks these felt cramped compared to other options.

5597542,0,t1_cwqvmku,Ah did the multibit upgrade materialize in something audible? Im thinking of an amplifier upgrade right now but Im not ruling out the DAC just yet. Maybe youd consider making a thread with your impressions when you get back from the meet? Theres at least one upvote in it for you if you do!Id say there are elements you just dont find on the s. Very subtle details though that you wouldnt miss if you didnt know theyre there. But there are many details I just never noticed on the s as well that is the most significant change of the two. I got the relisten my entire music collection feeling when I got the HEs but its even more pronounced with the HDs. Its a clear step up from the s to my ears anyway. And theyre not even that much more expensive I bought the s for  on ebay. So  got me a clear upgrade in sound quality AND build quality. And a chance to rediscover my music collection.No mods yet. I use Foobars EQ to lower the ampkhz band to make the treble spike at khz disappear. No longer an issue for me. I might gain something by doing it properly and modding them but right now I dont really feel the need to upgrade them theyre just perfect as they are. Of course as we know this is just a temporary feeling when they get a little older I will probably mod them.,headphones,cwqxfmh,1,t5_2rcyx

Instead of getting a  dedicated amp you can get a little worse amp with a much better DAC than onboard an amp is not necessary but it is a bonus since it offers more volume.

Cant just oh the bass is great like the Shure SEs or the treble is fantastic!! like the Noble Ks. With these and the As everything is in its place. When the a section of sound is required it comes out and does a great job doesnt linger or bleed over to other parts. Just makes one seamless sound. Sorry if thats not a super great answer Im sure Ill have better ways to put it as time goes on but Im only about  hours in. Edit Ok so new development on the how the sound front.... While sitting at your desk theyre amazing. A notch over the Ks Id say pretty safely. HOWEVER I just got back from a  hour walk around town and things played out differently. The way ADEL works is basically a mm rod about mm thick riding on whats basically Orings this moves with the sound waves letting that pressure escape taking the hit of the pressure rather than your ear drum. Thats fantastic when youre sitting still...but when youre doing something like walking it works against you. Basically anytime you have a calmer part of the song or just lowmedium volume levels you can very clearly hear the ADEL modules banging around. It sounds like somebody walking next to you wearing flipflops every step or anytime you move your head you hear a TWAPP TWAPP TWAPP. REAL irritating. Takes you out of the dreamlikestate of musical enjoyment really fast. Im going to look into plugging the ADEL holes and ditching the whole part of the unit hopefully I dont have to spend  just to get adjustable ones and screw them all the way in.So recap theyre great if youre just sitting down at your desk irritating if youre on the go. For the money you could get a bunch of different great overear options. lame.,headphones,cx5a7ot,4,t5_2rcyx

AKGs are a pretty good fit as they tend to do midrange a bit better than HD. Since you like asian poprock vocals Id have to agree that AKGs are a better fit.Another option that just came to mind are the Shure SRH  Shures house specialty is midrange since they make lots of microphones.

5797017,0,t3_3ukpbd, Best Sennheiser USB Headset Microphone? BackgroundIn the past I have tried several professional microphones from Samson GoMic to Sennheiser e and e to Rode Podcaster and M. I have loved them all pretty much except I always suffered from background noise.I do computer tutorials. I also am very short sighted. So looking at the screen and keeping the mic too close to avoid background noise is impossible. Im also not good at narration after the fact.After messing for so long with hardware and software gain controls and post processing I have found that using a headset or attaching a mic to a headset gave me best results. The ProblemAfter I couldnt find a good way to keep my GoMic attached to headset I bought Sennheiser PC  USB headset. I love it as much as I love their e mic but only when it works.Sometimes it has random  clicks coming from nowhere physical not even cable movement. A lot of the time on my MBPr it would have a lot of very loud static noise that my talking feels like the noise.The noise problem is mostly not there when I give my Windows Parallels VM full access to the headset. But other issues still exist. Looking at reviews showed that some others had similar issues and those who didnt were very happy with their headset mic.So maybe I just got one of the bad pieces. No guarantee if I order another one even from different seller Ill not get the same. Instead of gambling Id love to invest more and get some premium upgrade of the headset. The QuestionBut what is the premium Internet Telephony  Technical Support headset from Sennheiser? There is the PC  PC  which are priced close to the PC . There is the SC  USB or something similar. There are also the gaming headsets.I couldnt find anything that ranks the headsets in terms of which is more premium let alone when the microphone is the main focus. What would you suggest I buy?,headphones,cxfoaqq,2,t5_2rcyx

5815482,0,t1_cxhx7rr,I own the E at the moment. I cant compare with any of the FiiO lineup but I generally like it. Sound wise there is definitely a boost of volume compared to without it. When I use it with my iMac even at the lowest volume possible the sound is really loud but when I connect my headphones to my iMac its somewhat loud at the highest volume. The headphones in question are the Sennheiser Urbanite XL by the way. I dont think Ive noticed any differences in sound quality so far though.Based on reading reviews of FiiO models that are similarly priced to the E my impression is that the E provides a handful of secondary features besides being a DACamp. You can also use the E as a Bluetooth adapter for up to two pairs of headphones connected simultaneously and you can also use it as a dedicated USB microphone for example. Its also ridiculously portable and you can snap it on a bag strap and use it as a remote as it has music and call control buttons right on the device.,headphones,cxhyqqg,1,t5_2rcyx

5821249,0,t3_3uu7eg,Budget Id like to avoid going over  if possible. Source Primarily PS games possibly using mixAmp  but also for PC gaming and listening to music on my MacBook and iPhone. Most of my collection is normal quality  bitrate stuff so no need for super high res  high end stuff that only benefits super high quality music filetypes unless games have some weird lossless audio files Im not aware ofNo isolation reqs. though Im okay with closed or open.Im going to assume fullsized is the way to go here in terms of quality to  but whatever you guys recommend I think Id like an overall neutral total balance. I currently have a set of  Astro as with mixamp for gaming and Klipsch si II for non gaming stuff music movies. Ideally my new headphones would be good for both of these with primary focus on gaming stuff possibly through the mixamp.Preferred Music video game music naturally! So basically a little bit of everything but I guess a good mix of classical and electronic for the most part.Improve? Definitely a new pair of headphones would be my first nonIEM outside of Astro as but Id also like confirmation that the amp Im using an Astro a  mixamp is sufficient or a recommendation on an alternative.More infoIm in the market for a set of headphones for my PS. Audio quality for video games is the primary concern so Im willing to spend a decent amount as long as its worth it. Having the headphones also handle other media well music movies TV shows is a big plus too. Wired headsets are totally fine but Ill consider wireless if its really worth it.I currently own Astro as  edition but theyve been well used and Im hoping to make an upgrade. At this point Im strongly considering keeping my a mixamp and just buying some quality headphones. Note that Im totally okay with getting separate inline  external mic so Id strongly prefer just a normal set of headphones without a permanent mic so that I can use them in nongaming settings.One thing Im not sure about is whether to continue using my current a  amp buy a newer a TR amp or using something else entirely to connect to the PS.The real headphones Im currently looking at are Sony MDRA but after reading this sub for a while I havent seen it recommended often so you probably have other suggestions.Outside of using it on PS having them be reasonably portable so that I can use them with my phone and laptop would be a nice bonus but primary use is in my room all by myself so sound quality for games then music is definitely the priority.One last thing Im not a competitive gamer looking for something focused around multiplayer matches or streaming or audio filters that sound like garbage so that I can hear footsteps better or something dumb like that. I occasionally play online and use voice chat and whatnot but  of the time Im simply looking for an immersive single player experience. Id like something that sounds good and properly reproduces what the sound designer had in mind when making the game. I used to play with an amazing . THX certified home theater system when I was living at home but now that Im in college I need a pair of headphones instead but I still want an immersive high quality experience.

5844478,0,t1_cxkrmqo,I travel a lot too and over time have gravitated from full sized headphones to IEMs CIEMs because they are very isolating easy to carry I use a Pelican case and I get great sound quality. I also hop musical genres a lot so I need headphones that are versatile enough to go from classical to DnB. There arent very many closed headphones that  fold up  isolate well and  handle a bunch of genres with aplomb though. The PSB MU and NAD VISO HP come to mind but if you have a ig head the HP probably wont fit well and the PSB may or may not. If you have a Best Buy near where you live they may stock the MU so you may want to try it out.The Vmoda M isolates folds and is rugged but its relatively uncomfortable unless you get XL pads and IMO has too boomy bass for genres like jazz  acoustic  folkThe Sony MDRV or  are built like a tank fold and have a relatively neutral profile which makes them work well for multiple genre but may be somewhat light on the bass for EDM.,headphones,cxlqkb0,3,t5_2rcyx

5904886,0,t1_cxssndo,Yea they arent expensive.  I have them now.  I love the sound.  Im not great with descriptions but I will try.Its actually a V I found out! Not sure how they differ.  They sound quite flat from my limited understanding of what that means a touch more on the bright side.  The first thing I noticed was very prevalent acoustic sparkle.  Any acoustic string pluck is magic  .I know the frequency response is not as wide as my MDR sort of a newer version I guess with a very different sound but somehow just like that headphone it feels like it has incredible reach.  The bass rumble on both is clean and seems endlessly deep but more stable on the V than its younger cousin.  I think this may be more however because it is so well behaved.  It has a nice solid kick but remains just confident not overdone right to the end with no boomyness in the vocals or sub bass.  The soundstage is fairly good for a closed can and the imaging seems quite natural and accurate.  Im impressed very impressed actually.  I enjoy a variety of sound unique signatures more than just audiophile quality and I thought this was a great listen that ran the line between analytical accuracy and personality.  Since my grand total was  used  free I suggest people check out some used pairs of these.If I was to come up with an analogy.  I would say that the MDRV flat with great bass extension selective of source and analytical is like a AKG K and the MDR dark natural warm textured bass can break up with volume better for very engaging low volume listening non fatiguing laid back with source is like a HD.,headphones,cxtnxaa,1,t5_2rcyx

6019463,0,t3_3xwqpx,IMO this is a classical example of how the graphs dont tell the whole story.OP what you are doing in essence is comparing two headphones solely on the basis of the fact that their frequency response  is clockwisetilted across the entire audible range and then taking that single fact out of context to make an assumption that  isnt necessarily correlational. By that measure both the X and the M should remind you of the LCD because LCDs also have a clockwisetilted profile where output diminishes with increasing frequency.IMO outside that dark tilt to the frequency profile the M and the X sound nothing like each other. And neither of them sound like the LCD.tldr Its a good theory but from the perspective of logic its like saying a dog has ears a human has ears and so the dog reminds you of the humanhow do I know this?

Instead grab a CD and do it yourself.Second nowadays the differences are really subtle. Compression methods have gone a long way from the Napster days so dont feel bad for not noticing differences. Also be aware that at one point there should not be discernible differences.Thirdly listen to some sound queues. For example I immediately spot it by listening to the snare drums.Lastly might be a configuration issue Windows the DAC or whatever andor of your ears.

6227101,0,t3_40ut8i,I think newbies coming into this hobby get too easily swayed delving into the unknown feeding off subjective opinions. At the end of the day this hobby is about each and every one of us enjoying the music we love in a way that it sounds great to us. Its all about the music but often times this hobby makes it all about the gear casting musical enjoyment to the side. IMO youve become too caught up in your gear. The Ek is a perfectly fine sounding DAC which is on the warm side of neutral good pairing with both hd and he so you really dont need the ODAC and just line out into your magni for desktop and use the FiiO for a portable ampDAC. For me personally I love cans like the HE Rx THX Trp mods and plenty of other great desktop cans that do benefit from the additional amping. But I also absolutely love the Ax and KSC. Both are cheap as especially the Koss and even if I am around the aforementioned cans or better Ill quite happily chill out on those seemingly cheaper lowerfi cans because at the end of the day I can plug those headphones straight into almost any source and get lost in the music. And thats what its all about.,headphones,cyxgcci,1,t5_2rcyx

6246012,0,t3_414w6o,Ive had these for a few weeks now so Ive decided to post this mini review. The TH is exactly what I was looking for in a pair of headphones! If you are a fan of bass I would definitely recommend the TH. Maybe just wait for the Mk to come out first and see if there is a price drop.ProsIm not super familiar with all of the audiophile terms but everything sounds so crisp and sharp with these headphones. Its like looking at a super high resolution photograph. I know this is what everyone says but I heard things in songs I had never heard before. The improvement from my K was instantly noticeable the moment I started listening to these. The TH is super fun to listen to. There is definitely an emphasis on the lowsbass. Listening to music with these just makes me want to start nodding my head and tapping my feet. Also I love listening to the rheadphones bass test here   They are light and comfortable. I thought the TH would be a downgrade from the K in terms of comfort but Id say they are about the same.ConsWay too expensive. It would have been nice if they offered a model without the fancy ear cups if it meant it would cost less. Something like the THXs cups would be nice. The Mk is coming out later this month in Japan so the price may become lower.Surprisingly open for what looks like a closed pair of headphones. No sound isolation. No detachable cables The Mk will have them My next stepsI will probably end up modding these to have detachable cables. Im looking forward to using these with balanced cables.,headphones,cyzlqvu,5,t5_2rcyx

6263138,0,t3_41dkp4,Personally I think its human hearing loss almost always starts at high frequencies and can dramatically effect how someone voices a headphone. So what sounds terribly unbalanced to one might be great for someone else because agedamage to earscleanliness of earsclogged earshairgeneticsetc makes everyone hear these frequencies quite differently.I personally notice unbalanced bass quite a bit but that may be due to practice critical listening for years.Midrange is where human hearing excels as its where the human voice resides.

6272623,0,t3_41ioft,Just to make sure...you did figure out that theres a bass switch on the COP?The Cop is almost as bassy in the linear bass position as the M. So if you turn it up a notch you should definitely get the same if not more bass than the M offers.A portable amplifier is probably not going to help either. Apple products have very competent audio components and the COP is fairly efficient and has a low impedance Impedance. . . . . . . . . . . . .   Sound pressure Level. . . . . . . .  dBmWSo....set the bass selector switch to position  aka. heavy Bass and if thats not enough bass....well maybe strap a subwoofer to your head.edit another recurring problem I just remembered. Do you use a case with your phone? Have you ensured that the mm jack is actually plugged in ? Sometimes phone cases prevent the jack from being completely inserted and that kills the bass response. Also test the COP with different source devices PC  Tablet and check the sound. MAybe you once selected a low bass EQ preset on your phone and forgot about it.,headphones,cz2mkd7,7,t5_2rcyx

6315246,0,t3_423gk9,I was using some bassboosted JVC headphones called the HAMRx Extreme Exploders or something like that. I bought them because of the impressivesounding mm drivers.The pads were cheap pleather and the earcups were big and bulky because they had this weird armoured design with the letters XX on them. I eventually broke them because I threw them around and stepped on them when I got up from my desk all the time. I superglued them together then got another week out of them before they crapped out on me completely.So I looked at  dollar can options haha rude and decided on the HDs because the Ms looked terrible as desktop headphones.When I was waiting for my HDs to arrive from amazon I used my samsung S galaxy earbuds. After a few hours they stopped feeling like earbuds and my ear canals stopped feeling like ear canals. I dont think Ill be using IEMs for a while.As for the audio source aspect of my hobby I started off using the HDs with my cheap motherboard audio ALC. I had to stop using front panel audio because my leg slammed into the freakishly large combination of the HD jack and the .mm gt.mm adapter Seriously midrange and low impedance cans and you default to a .mm jack?. The ground ring of the headphones input on my case was ripped out and the adapters jack was severely bent. I ended up buying a Soundblaster Z for my new headphones but I returned it because it cost  dollars and almost blew my ears out two times. This was the issue So I ended up getting a Xonar DGX and enjoying my headphones with it. Ever since then I bought a Soundblaster E HD EVOs V and just yesterday a pair of ATHmXs for  USD because why not.,headphones,cz7h2bo,1,t5_2rcyx

6316029,0,t3_423gk9,Id had some Grado SR and SR back in high school which I liked a lot.  Then at the beginning of the summer I was fed up with my Logitech G headset so I ordered a pair of HD.  Then quickly got a Uberfrost and Lyr  to drive them.  Within about a month or so I ordered the Fidelio X for prime day on amazon.  They were ok.  The next week I went to go try some LCDX and came home from the store with them and some new tubes for my amp. I think it was less than a month after that I got a AstellampKern AK and some JH Angie IEM as a portable setup.  Got some new old stock Telefunken ECC tubes for my Lyr  which really were a nice step up from there.  I went to try the LCD back in October and Chord was launching the Mojo at the same time and I got the first one in North America at the launch really impressive for something so tiny.

All I can say is they blew me away. Within  songs I was thinking about how I could get k together. They seemed harder to drive but the comfort was off the charts and the resolution was absolutely incredible even better than the LCDs. I was really impressed. I listened to some Steely Dan for instance and you could hear vocal sustain I never knew was there and it was all over the place. The only criticism I had was a slight one on the build quality. While they were impressive in every way on that front super durable feeling there were little things you would only notice on close inspection like light machining marks on the inside of the cup brackets and a slight gap in spots where the outer metal on the cups met the wood. Minor stuff but for k there should be some hand finishing. At any rate I have decided to get some LCDs now and set aside  of the cost of the HDS.

6349397,0,t1_czb2toh,gt The Magni  claims that it can output a lot of power. But its so small and headphone amplifiers that put out comparable power are nearly ten times the size. Take a look at the R Nano vs the R Fury nonX version. You could probably tell right away that there is simply no way that the R Nano could match the R Fury in performance because it had to be gimped because of the enormous heatsink thats on the R Fury. Its the same deal with the Magni . It claims it can output a lot of power but it cant do it well. It also has preamp outputs but I dont know why because the only thing they can power is cheap computer speakers that are selfpowered anyway.Uhh... The Magni is a Class AB topology while bigger amps are Class A. This is a weird statement to make when youre not comparing similar things. AB is much more efficient and can be put into smaller housings. I mean it probably wont sound as good as an amp ten times its size but its a tenth of the cost. I actually havent tried the Magni so I wont make any assumptions on its sound but its cheaper than a JDS O so it seems pretty hard to knock it.Preamp outputs are pretty useful if you also have a speaker system and dont want to spend more money on a preamp after buying a power amp Ill use my current situation as an example I  found an insane deal on a nice power amp on Craigslist but Im stuck without any sort of preamp so I just bought a Sys because I found one locally for like .

6365665,0,t3_42r15n,Im looking for wireless earphones that will be very comfortable convenient durable and unhearable for the people around me. Budget  Around  give or take a bit. Less would be nice. Source  Generally a computer. Would be nice if I dont need any special drivers and if they worked on Windows and Linux. Working with a phone is a plus but not at all required. Requirements for Isolation  Isolation from incoming noise is not important. I guess a mid level would be best. Very important is low leakage at least if I understand the concept right Ill be using these at work in a quiet environment with multiple people at a distance of around two arm lengths. I dont want anyone else to be bothered with noise from my headphones. Will you be using these Headphones in Public? Yes. Preferred Type of Headphone  Im thinking closed over ear. The important factors here are comfort and not leaking noise to people beside me. Preferred tonal balance  Doesnt matter. Sound quality does not matter I mean I dont want static screeching noises but Im far far from being an audiophile.Past headphones  Cheap  ear buds from Amazon. The sound quality is perfectly fine but the inear form factor and the wire are getting on my nerves. I either move too far for the wire to reach or the wire gets tangled in my chairs wheels. Preferred Music  Generally rock but Im not too worried about sound specifics. What would you like to improve on from your setup  No wire more comfortable form. ,headphones,czd7f9v,1,t5_2rcyx

6438845,0,t1_czl6oyo,I would much rather trust my ears over measurements. Measurements just give you a general idea but you will almost always gain much more insight from hearing cans yourself. Yes Tyll tends to generally be a good reviewer but his preferences and my own are quite different. The subjective is so primary in this hobby but I try to judge in terms of more objective ways such as transient ability and relative lack of peaks and valleys in the response as well as imaging and soundstage width. However not all of these are immediately obvious from measurements. Then I can make a guess as to whether one person may like or dislike the cans based on their preferences from there. Good and bad suck as headphone sound description but in the aggregate in my opinion and from personal experience reviewing them myself I still think the M is just outclassed by lots of other stuff. Thats all. And thats my bad on the winged AT prices. In fact from what Ive read they are actually even cheaper in Japan than the US but  euros in some places? Jesus. ,headphones,czlbcua,1,t5_2rcyx

6518459,0,t3_44vgwx,The difference in technology development cost materials and manufacturing process between a cheap lofi headphone and a hifi flagship are nightandday. Getting the HD to perform like it does with soundstage and imaging performance that approaches highend audiophile grade loudspeakers and incredible resolution would be a very long and intensive development project. Getting headphones so sound like that is very very hard and then getting the technology into a form that can be economically produced is also hard. Getting them to sound like that not only takes the technology but manufacturing tolerances that have to be perfect super good pair matching of drivers serious QA certification everything has to be perfectly to measure without even slight defects  which means they can only be made by inhouse special production stations and employees using custom tools and systems.

6537380,0,t3_456bx5,   As my first pair of what Id say are high quality cans I obviously am not the best at reviewing headphones. That being said however in the short time listening to some different types of music on these I have to say they sound fantastically warm and inviting. The highs are not offensive the bass has a nice thuddy kick cant explain it any differently honestly haha and the mids feel just right. For closedbacks the soundstage is great for my needs. I am by no means an audiophile but as I believe is true for many of you I thoroughly enjoy listening to various genres of music.   Besides these cans I dont have any audio gear yet but I assure you all its soon to come! When connected to my PC the volume is perfect and is driven easily. When switching over to my phone I feel like these could benifit from a small amp like a Fiio portable one... its OK otherwise but feels a teeny bit shortsheeted like it needs to work a bit harder to get the volume you want.

6598379,0,t3_460iq3,I cannot tell the difference between Tidal and Spotify reliably. There might be a few odd wellmastered songs here and there but  of the time its really hard. You should be able to hear a difference in detail tone and presentation in a good song though.I suggest listening to songs you are very familiar with.  Humans are sensitive to expressions on peoples faces. Changes can be easily noticeable to our eyes. Just like with vocals our hears are typically tuned to notice the changes. Therefore vocals could be helpful to your understanding of a quality headphone. It might just be me but I find human performances to be more sensitive to headphones. Fingers on a guitar or a bow on a string has a human touch and can brought to light with a good headphone. Have you ever been to a live performance of one of your favourite artists? This might help you develop some interest in the finer details that they can have.,headphones,d01tr5e,1,t5_2rcyx
6600725,0,t1_d020flv,Balanced is less about improving sound and more about noise rejection.The basic principles behind balanced cables and differential signaling are pretty well outlined in this wiki article but all you need to know is that balanced cables simply put are more resistant to outside interference.No matter your environment unless you live in a faraday cage there is going to be some sort of electromagnetic waves floating about. These interact with your cables and cause interference or noise. In longer cables this is more of an issue as there is a larger surface area in which to interact with electromagnetic waves. Obviously the impact of this is minimal in an optimum scenario but many of us operate in less than ideal conditions.Either way less interference is better right? Even at very low levels more sensitive headphones may pick up unwanted interference higher than the noise floor of the source material or amplification stage. Balanced cabling simply lowers the effective amount of interference. Certainly it isnt necessary but its never a negative thing. All things being equal Id take balanced equipment over unbalanced but its often more expensive to go with a balanced setup. The difference will be great for some or completely inaudible for others it really depends on your environment and equipment.,headphones,d022hzq,6,t5_2rcyx
6600744,0,t1_d021re6,I like to think of myself as a well balanced objective and subjective headphone buyer. I take both in consideration and I sometimes let the snake oil wash over me and influence my purchase a little. But I need some science to back it up. I too was interested in a balanced set up. For the most part the only science I could find all said it only matters in long cable setups . LONG like concert hall long. Okay but it might be cool to have a balanced setup anyway right. Some of the stuff we buy is because it just cool. I would have to buy a truly balanced dac for a truly balanced amp and buy a balanced set of cans or get one of my other sets converted meaning I could not use them on my old set up. It doesnt seem the worth headache at all to me unless you can throw around  or K on a whole new set up. Lots of the guys in the sub can. I sure cant. ,headphones,d022kjg,1,t5_2rcyx

6702705,0,t1_d0c3fh5,The assumption is that the tube amp even alters the linear and nonlinear distortion characteristics of a given system in a manner that can be perceived outside of what nonbiascontrolled AB tests purport.EQ parameters then depend on the amplifier if there is sufficient alteration of the response. You are insisting on a global answer to a question with numerous solutions unique to each setup. High output Z OTLs can bump up the bass to an indeterminate degree depending on amp and the headphones impedance curve. Measurements can pinpoint the exact boostcut needed. Treble rolloff from transformers can also be similarly quantified.Bob Carvers Stereophile Challenge also showed that it was possible to emulate the sound of a tubed amp from ConradJohnson that could initially be differentiated from his SS amp design. He then nulled the difference output of both amps to dB or so and Stereophile did not do better than random chance. That was over  decades ago.It is trivial to capture the tube amp sound with existing tools.,headphones,d0cm8uy,2,t5_2rcyx

6785749,0,t1_d0kmbim,That post was the bullshit one that showed how little he knew about psychoacoustics. Appealing to authority is convenient and all even if Moffats claim of being the inventor of the outboard DAC can legitimately be contested by several people like John Westlake.He claims that there is some optimization of phase that can account for all the phase distortions from all components preceding it in the chain. How the hell does the DAC know what is the microphone the ADCDAC and masteringmixing speakers used for each and every recording and corrects for their phase distortion? Does it read the liner notes for you? I dont think this claim needs explanation as to why its bullshit.Phase audibilitytemporal resolution is highly overrated. Lipshitz and Vanderkooys seminal paper on phase audibility later supported by Griesingers independent results found littleno discernable difference except in very specific vocal recordings in direct comparison. Without a fastswitched AB under the best conditions possible we cant identify phase distortion as something inherently wrong. Hardly seems possible for far less optimized home conditions to throw up more difference. Temporal resolution of the ear is also strongly limited by temporal masking. The claimed increase in timing resolution is far outweighed by temporal masking.Moffat and his supporters also claim a huge improvement in imaging and soundstage but nothing in the DAC alters sound in a manner that alters our localization process. It doesnt alter the interaural timephase difference or level difference used in binaural localization. It doesnt alter reflections at the listening position and therefore change perceived spaciousness clarity and stage width properties. It doesnt even equalize something to account for your HRTF.gtIt is our time domain optimization that gives the uncanny sonic hologram that only Thetas and Yggys do. It also allows the filter to disappear. Has to be heard to understand. Since lower frequency wavelengths are measured in tens of feet placement in image gets increasingly wrong as a function of decreasing frequency in non time domain optimized recordings  these keep the listeners ability to hear the venue  not to mention the sum of all of the phase errors in the microphones mixing boards eq etc on the record side.Placement and imaging drops off a cliff with lower frequency not because recordings arent time domain optimized an arbitrary term with no mention of what optimization he is looking for but because of the inherent limits to our hearing system. When wavelength gets to tens of feet as he says our ears cannot process the phase differences used to localize lower frequency sound at all. It is a physiological constraint of the human auditory system. Unless the Yggy knows how to implant a bionic ear beyond what audiologists can muster or your ears have evolved no one is hearing localization effects at these wavelengths. Room modes for speakers perhaps but not with headphones and certainly not with this DAC.No wonder everyone pointed and laughed.  Moffat may be a great engineer but he doesnt know human hearing.,headphones,d0lg9fo,4,t5_2rcyx

6841693,0,t1_d0rss8e,I think you may have a fundamental misunderstanding about the general trends and patterns that cause certain goods or services to have a particular price in the marketplace. Im sure umadeconomist could say it better than I could.You seem to be assuming that the cost of the inputs for a particular good  the physical components the intellectual process the humanskilled labor and the manufacturing space  are multiplied by some percentage called markup by the industry and sold at that price. Thats not how it works. Markup is a useful metric that might indicate that a particular good is overvalued or undervalued or perhaps a surplusshortage but it does not really determine the price in the way you seem to be arguing. It might not be unreasonable to argue that China has an absolute and relative advantage when it comes to lowskilled labor. The opportunity cost for such a country to manufacture electronics is demonstratively low. This does not mean that goods produced in the US are overunder priced. If the Schiit stuff if quality enough for you at the price point why complain that it could be cheaper if produced elsewhere? Clearly the demand exists to set the price at the current level. Flooding the market would probably actually lose them money at this point.

6869109,0,t3_49uie5,I just finished my mandatory military service about a week ago and to reward myself I went and indulged in my favourite hobby. Nobody in my household knows I got a new headphone since it looks almost the same as my previous ones the ADX PI bought this second hand from a local forum for SGD . The beautiful case its sitting in was included at no extra cost. This was a great deal especially considering how its MSRP was almost close to a grand in Singapore dollars. Not to mention its a pretty rare piece of equipment and its also discontinued. My local stores only carry its successor the ATHADX. The first thing that came to my mind when I put it on was how goddamn tight the clamping force was. Ive had plenty of AT cans before but none have clamped this tight before. Im hoping for it to loosen and adjust to my head in due time as I dont think these cans have seen much use in a very long time or so the previous owner tells me. The drivers on these cans are also not angled like the ADX so the drivers ended up touching my ear. Luckily I bought a thicker aftermarket pair of velour pads to remedy the issue for my ADX and just put it on these ADks. The drivers still touch my ears but not nearly as much as before. Please bear with me as Im not too experienced in describing how headphones sound like. These have a narrower soundstage than the ADX. In fact it also sounds less airy than the ADX which was a bit of a surprise. Im slightly disappointed but overall I would say that it sounds much richer and clearer than the ADX. Female vocals unsurprisingly sound great on this can and are absolutely a treat to a listen to. KJPop and JAV sound amazing as female vocals are emphasized on and they capture my attention in a way that I have not experienced before. Undoubtedly its a very engaging piece of kit. Im not sure if its placebo but I do find the ADks to be more resolving as I hear more details in tracks as compared to the ADX. Comfort issues aside Im extremely delighted with the purchase and I look forward to many more enjoyable hours of music movies and gaming. Feel free to ask me any questions you may have!,headphones,d0uxajh,12,t5_2rcyx

I remember when I used the HD  Id forget its on my head. On the i its pretty comfortable but I can still feel it clamp on my head. I cant imagine using these for  hours straight without a minor headache.Bass response Compared to the HD ? UNREAL. Definitely a upgrade. The bass is nice in a way where its like ripplessorry if thats a bad description. ITs definitely a special kind of bass and its very addicting. The HD  had decent bass but it sounds boring compared to these.SoundStage Its definitely a more intimate open headphone so I would say the HD  wins in terms of soundstage. However because it has a smaller soundstage and the sound is more intimate songs such as EDMdubstep and rock sound much better on these than the HD . However classical music I would say the HD  wins since a bigger soundstage is preferred for classical music and because of the HD s reference tonality.Sorry if im not being clear of anything.

The LCDX was recently RMAd received around March   or so. The L was imported from PriceJapan directly. The Master  was produced in . It should also be known that the M is known to be a very smooth warm amplifier with a vast amount of microdetail. I personally prefer this over the Schiit Ragnarok which has more aggressive treble and hard hitting bass. For me not all headphones react to amplifier differences but I found it to be important and noticeable for all my  headphones. Perhaps the HD being the biggest offender.Test TracksDayme Arocena  El RusoStevie Wonder  Ribbon in the SkyEric Clapton  LaylaOdesza  All We Needhyukoh  Comes and GoesSennheiser HDdynamicreference Best strength for me is the large soundstage that actually has depth and width associated with it. The midrange is smooth with a slight peak at the top end but its tolerable with the cork and DuPont mod. It does lack bass but the cork mod helped a lot for my setup and other AGDHD users have reported the same. Its clinical analytical and can be boring at times but definitely has a purpose in my rig.  I would recommend this as a main can though you may find yourself wanting another headphone or reverting to speakers for more easy listening. Also be warned that it is slightly difficult to pair with amps. But in terms of TOTL headphones this is your best bang for your buck.Audeze LCDXplanarfun This headphone is veiled in the treble area and even though its open it feels like it lacks air. The midrange is nothing to write home about I am not that pleased with guitar when it comes to the X but its the most musical headphone Ive ever owned. Its quite aggressive when paired well and give it  songs after listening to the HD you can see yourself toetapping to the music. Its a bit on the warm side and I think the well textured bass is its strong point. I think this headphone makes very good first impressions though sometimes the bass is too overdone as it bleeds into the midrange which makes it a love it or hate it can. I prefer these over the LCDs which I found a bit too tamed though I know that people who prefer the  tend to hate the X too.STAX Lelectrostaticreference My first foray into electrostatic headphones and I am not disappointed at all. I have heard a few estats in the past but Ive never had anything for extended listening. This was a blind buy as I was curious with estats and considering that it was the same price as the old can I have sold the Ether open I decided to take a gamble and I am pleasantly surprised. They are very clean and nimble to the point that they might not even have any personality with them. They lack the soundstage that the HD has but they are fully neutral along with having insane amount of detail. There is a lack of subbass though I am still trying to figure this out since it might just be a seal issue from my end. Add in the fact that I have long hair girl they may not be sealing properly. My only complaint about them is that they can be too quick for others that theyre considered too light but I do not regret owning the L at all. I can see how people get addicted to the STAX sound.As of now in terms of enjoyment I rank my  headphones asL gt HD gt LCDXThe LCDX is definitely my fun pair while the other two are more for serious and perhaps grander experiences in listening. While I can say that there is an overlap between the HD and the L in certain cases they are very different at the time you listen to them. ,headphones,d165zaz,23,t5_2rcyx

Fits in your budget and balanced sounding enough to work well with all genres.  However they are not going to be able to be used outside.  Additionally like I mentioned above they will leak sound like very low volume speakers and you will be able to hear your surroundings pretty well without music playing.As for closed options your choices are a bit more limited.

7159303,0,t3_4dfx7e,Location  Norway.  Budget   dollars.  Source  Mainly pc but for Samsung Galaxy S.  Requirements for Isolation  As much as possible for noise cancellation and sound leakage.  Preferred Type of Headphone  Only closed cans duo to my situation.  Preferred Tonal Balance  General quality for low mid and high.  Preferred Music  Wide variety from acoustic to rock to pop to rnbamphiphop FilmSeriesVideo Game Soundtracks.  Additional preference  Must be able to hook up Antlion Mod.Mic . UniDirectional microphone to the headphone.  Ive decided to stop wasting my money on badaverage quality headsets and finally turned to the path of genuine and legit audio world. I wish I did it from the start instead of throwing my money away on gamingheadsets. But hey atleast better late then never.Just a tad bit information first. I prefer having open cans over closed cans since I find the audio soundstage to be better for my listening experience and preference. But as of right now I am not able to enjoy time with a pair of open cans duo to my situation. At this moment I still live with my parentsthey are quite loud individuals take the buss to and from school in a daily basis live in a quite loud and open neighbourhood with plenty of dogs in the areabarking almost all the time and vehicles that drive bythrough my street nonstop or so it feels like it atleast. My surrounding is quite loud in general and it annoys me when I am trying to game and communicate with my friends.I am a solid gamer who have no problem spending sevreal hours without a break so I need a pair of closed cans which got excellent audio both for gaming and music in general. As of right now I am leaning towards the Beyerdynamic DT  ohm. I am wide open for suggestions for other pair of closed cans. By the way my budget is in total of  dollars and Im planing to combine the headphone with the Antlion Audio ModMic . UniDirectional microphone. I would really appricate if the pair of cans are able to be used properlypowerwise since I know somemany cans do need amp and soundcard with my smartphone too since Ill be listening a bunch to music on the go.To get an idea of what type of gaming sounds and quality I seek to archieve I will write down what I do game as of today. I mainly play on the pc but sometimes Ill play and chill with friends on the ps. I game CSGo Tom Clancys The Division NBA Live Fifa Madden NFL World Of Warcraft and League Of Legends. So you can say Im kinda an allaround gamer. Oh and I do play Tekken and Street Fighter.I dont know if this is really useful but Ill just add a list of headsets Ive previously used and are using as of right now.

But then I can definitely tell a difference between headphones like the K HD DT and HEi. I can agree that the O is behind the competition probably wont be getting any future revisions anymore since NwAvGuy just stopped but other than that I dont know how any other amp can really help me get better performance out of my current pair of headphones.The first time I was really blown away by an ampDAC was when I was listening to my ATHMs through my friends Fiio E and EK.

List of amps Ragnarok v Egoista Moon HA Wa Wa Lau gsxmkii Prautes oppo HA and Burson Conductor. A few others as well all with the Abyss.When I bought my Ragnarok the only thing I cared about was getting an amp that could get the best out of my headphones knowing full well I would buy the Abyss soon When I compare all my different amps and the ones Ive heard at shows with the Abyss the differences are really subtle. As in there is almost no way you could blind test and pick which amp was which.You would need to sit with the gear for months to decide which one was fractionally better. Even then who knows what biases you have.When I compare my k and Abyss on the o odac vs my desktop rig I am sorry to say but the o is  of a rr DAC and a .k class A sterophile preamp and component of the year Ragnarok.Some headphones do scale but its like a good single malt. Those that dont care about Scotch dont try enough to have a useful opinion.Those that have bought  bottles blind swear it is the best spirit on earth.

7200399,0,t1_d1wgc7s,No this is completely false and misleading and I suggest you edit your post. I did not complain about my post getting removed so stop changing the context of the situation. I wanted to ask before I posted whether or not I was breaking the rules. This was to ensure I wasnt breaking the rules in the first place. You said no and I saw posts similar to mine needless to say Im going to question why my post is any different to theirs  and that mine would get removed and theirs didnt so maybe they have a different format or something like that. I just wanted to delve deeper because as that time I hadnt posted much to r headphones.All I wanted was an explanation to an obviously confusing situation. What did I get?Here is some key quotesIm going to personally scrutinize every threadHow about instead of skirting fringes you follow the rules that youre clearly aware of being on the fringe of so I dont have to click remove and make you repost it into the purchasing advice thread where youve made it clear whatever youre asking belongs.So here youve basically said accused me of being sneaky and threatening and discriminating against me with  explanation. You will personally remove any thread of mine thats the exact same as others. So here we have a new user of the subreddit trying to understand the rules and this is how you reply to him?Is this really following rule  mate? No I think not. You couldve been much more respectful to me and just explained it in a way I could understand instead of just saying. These are the rules follow them or get your post removed by me personally now stop wasting our timeLet me give you an analogy of how I viewed the situation. Say there is a little kidsuitable in this case considering I hadnt made many threads in r headphones so I didnt know the rules well and neither would the kid who doesnt understand the real world who was at a school event. He sees all these little kids taking say an extra piece of candy he himself like candy and wants an extra one even though the teacher said  each. He asks the teacher can I have an extra piece of candy like the other kids?. The teacher replies with No. The kid asks Why all those kids are getting an extra piece?. The teacher replies I said no! stop trying to be sneaky and follow the rules I will personally watch you take your candy and if ever try to take more than  piece I will come and personally remove you from the line and put you on detention.Ask yourself in this situation did the teacher do a good job of educating the kid? No clearly the kid didnt want to break the rules which is why he asked the teacher in the first place but he likes candy so if he can get an extra piece why not ask? However he still doesnt understand why everyone other than him gets to have more candy and all he received was a threat that scared and worried him without answering any more questions.,headphones,d1wmlnf,-5,t5_2rcyx

Its just that everything Im reading on the web implies they are worth paying the price and I cant see why. They dont even have what I would call a soundstage listening to a serious speakerbased system puts thing into perspective and while I like the emphasized I never said they are neutral bass which actually does obscure some detail so what as long as other things compensate? its not what I like most about them. Its the mids I particularly enjoy. Compared to them the mids of the KXXs are dead lifeless. Id even say the mids of the KXX are the worst of all my headphones.Look maybe other people found a match made in heaven with some amp andor signal source but my impression is that others simply lack a proper reference and jumped into the hype train.,headphones,d1yuyya,1,t5_2rcyx

7337570,0,t3_4fv6hd,I posted pics of my setup before but since I got some new stuff I figure Id do it again. Crosspost from raudiophile but plenty of headphones stuff too  Ill include all listening impressions for those interested.EquipmentSpeakers KEF LS also comparing it to KEF Q Ascend Sierra  Vienna Acoustics Mozart GrandSubwoofer REL Quake IIIntegrated amp TEAC AHHeadphones HiFiMan HEi Philips X Beyerdynamic DT ProGot some new gear and think Ive officially reached my personal end game for my desktop setup as a side note Im a couple of ribbontweeter surround speakers away from being done in my main listening room as well at least on the audio side. I was using KEF Qs for speakers and the Philips X as my everyday headphones previously. Im much more of a speakers guy and use headphones sparingly and as a result I cant justify spending thousands on headphones like I do speakers but do enjoy having nice sound from them when called upon. Decided to join the planar club with the HEi to go along with my personal endgame passive desktop speaker the venerable KEF LS.  Ive written listening impressions before so Ill just compare my new gear with some of my old ones.i vs XI use the TEAC to drive both headphones and theyre both pretty efficient and fairly easy to drive. I have the volume knob between  of the way and it gets plenty loud at that level.  Compared to the X the i has a little bit more detail. Classical instruments sound a little bit more realistic. String instruments and especially violins seem more truetolife on the i. The i also seems to be a tad more precise positionally with sounds seeming to come above you when the track calls for it. It has a more intimate presentation and sounds more closed in than on the X. The balance is more neutral and the bass is more tight and textured.  For things that it doesnt do as well as the X soundstage and openness are the  biggest issues for me. The X sound almost like speakers in a room and the sense of air and space add an extra dimension to the sound. And although a tad more loose in the bass regions the accentuated bass of the Xs is something I definitely preferred the X also sounds like it digs deeper as well.  The sound signature of the X is just more addicting and fun for my tastes in music hiphop RampB many forms of EDMhouse the X is better.  The i would be more preferred by your classic audiophile and the X is probably better for the common man. Theyre both great and complement each other but if I had to choose only one itd be the X. Good thing I dont have to choose  Im keeping both. I have since moved the X to the bedroom paired with a Schiit Fulla which works well for late night listening with Netflix or checking out my HouseEDM playlists.KEF LS vs. KEF QI loved the Qs for nearfield use and when the upgrade itch got the better of me I knew I wanted to stay with KEFs UniQ for its driver coherence at close distances although I did look into other options such as the Salk WOW Minimonitor.  Both speakers tonally have a little bit of a topend tilt and a tad brightness which I actually dont mind.  Thats where the similarities end however. The LS is obviously in another class in terms of imaging realism and resolution.  The Q is a fine speaker but the LS is a flagshiplevel product.KEF LS vs. Ascend Sierra I also have the Sierra  in my main listening system and due to the price these  speakers are natural competitors.  I didnt AB them sidebyside so Im going by auditory memory at this point. The Sierra s are also in another room anchored by dual Rythmik subwoofers. The Sierras are the definition of neutrality with nearly rulerflat measurements on and off axis  theyre the best bookshelf speakers Ive ever heard  its only weaknesses IMO is its vertical dispersion although very good isnt the best Ive heard so it cant create that wall of sound that the best electrostatics can give you. So how does the LS stack up? Its almost quite to the level of the Sierra  but not quite. Its a little brighter and can by comparison sound a little harsh in the top end. The LS images beautifully though and Id say its on the level of the Sierra . The Sierra  is just the more dynamic speaker and gives off a better sense of air and realism in the music. Its close though. KEF LS vs. Vienna Acoustics Mozart GrandThough not totally comparing apples to apples since the LS is a standmount and the Mozarts are a floorstander Ill make the comparison based on the sound Im hearing from the LS  my REL subwoofer combined.  The Mozarts arent designed to be flat or neutral but more warmcolored and very enjoyable for music. Music just sounds natural and right and at the risk of using too much audiophile jargon has a sweetness and richness to its sound.  The LS is better at detail retrieval however but on some tracks can sound a bit analytical by comparison. The Mozarts are weightier and give the sound more body the LSs are more nimble and quick. Voices and acoustic instruments just sound so damn good on the LSs.So what did I learn from all of this? Basically nothing I didnt realize before. Although headphones give an interesting audio experience and better detail for the price they cant convey the sense of space realism and separation of good speakers.  I think Im pretty much done purchasing new headphones because the ones I have are good enough the HEi and X are endgame headphones to me personally. No headphones regardless of price can compete with the KEF LS and Ascend Sierra  IMO. ,headphones,d2c8c5e,14,t5_2rcyx

Neutral with a bit of that mechanical German bite to it. If you like Beyers youll love the T. Better imaging and more less exaggerated soundstage than the HD but havent listened to them back to back to directly compare. The SE is my favourite of the bunch because of how not fussy it is with source. It runs from my phone perfectly. The filters seem like a gimmick but really add a lot of value in terms of making them extremely versatile. Theyre fairly forgiving to source material despite how resolving they are. Have great sub bass and a soundstage that really fills every inch of your cranium.

Gaming headsets are like  headphones with  mics and  worth of advertising. A DACAMP is not needed for the HDs unless you have a very bad motherboard. Needless to say though it does offer a decent improvement over without. The ADXX are great for gaming too.

7531733,0,t1_d2ybh7i,I will admit that I did hear things with the HDs that I didnt hear before with my other headphones but they are  and they certainly werent  times as good. It was a small difference. For general music listening I dont care about squeezing every ounce of detail out of the headphones. I would rather have a realistic natural sounding headphone that properly renders sounds the way I hear then in real life and isnt fatiguing. The HD does that for me while I found the treble on the HD to be a bit thin or metallic sounding and not as realistic or full as the HD. The HD is noticeably more comfortable though and definitely has a larger sound stage. If I could get Hd comfort and soundstage with HD wound I would probably never need another pair of headphones.,headphones,d2ybkpq,1,t5_2rcyx

7619966,0,t3_4jo3av,In theory if both amps are using an reasonable input buffer stage on their RCA inputs and the DAC has a robust output buffer stage you could use an RCA splitter and connect the DACs single line level output to both amp inputs and not have any problem.The DAC line level output is a voltagebased signal. You would be wiring up the amp input impedances in parallel. The Modi  output impedance is  ohms. Using the rough  ratio youd want your amp input impedances in parallel come out to at least  ohms. But in practice youd probably still want something more reasonable like  kohms or higher in parallel. So as long as both your amp input impedances are  kohm or higher it should be fine.Do not do this in reverse. Do not hook up two DACs into one amp input.,headphones,d38cmo4,2,t5_2rcyx

For PC gaming I just plugged it into my PCs jack or use an aux cable from the PC output into the mixamp and I could leave the headphones plugged in and go right back to the PS without unplugging anything.The headphones are extremely comfortable  I could wear them for  hour gaming sessions without feeling like I need to take them off.The microphone comes in clear to anyone Ive used communications with in games also which is always good.I also looked at the Game One before purchasing but I think the overall reviews and recommendations I had seen pointed to the D..

Super warm and lush yet not laid back with  percent as good imaging as the sr. Easily the best imaging I heard in the meet. Clarity and transparency is paradoxically good despite lush sound. Very textured sounding. However bass is a tad muddy but I suspect a lush tube amp and the lush sound of the headphone is just too much a of good thing Im pretty sure it would sound more balanced and cleaner in a ss setup.  Stage while on the small side still has a out of your head sound.Sr  mkLess lush than the he  cleaner bass and more bass extension. Smoooooooth and laid back. Imaging not as good as the he  but has a larger stage. The biggest problem IMO with the sr is that its a bit too polite sounding nothing sounded out of place outside of sounding a tad dark and its speed tone imaging detail etc is off the charts good but I can see something people thinking it might be too laid back.Stax lamadaWorst sounding of the  stats but definitely the cheapest.

If you have a mechanical keyboard fan oh..or if you have anyone doing anything at all in your house it will be picked up.You can adjust the noise gate for the Yeti in Teamspeak but it isnt worth the headache..just get a Modmic and pair it with some decent headphones.NOTE the HD s are amazing for competitive gaming but they do lack any sort of fun bass if you are going to compare them to the As.

7921230,0,t3_4nqc9e,They are weird headphones. Ive owned  Nighthawks. When I first heard them Im in the minority that fell in love with them at first listen. I HATE headphones that boost things especally treble and we are in an era where treble boosted headphones are everywhere just like the s although more products are becoming more neutral warmer more even.I loved the warmth but weirdly it does go awayto a degree Theres rubber round the drivers and if you buy a new pair chances are its stiff so notes decay longer out of three pairs needed some run it time after a few hours this loosens up tightens although the NH does remain quite smooth. After hours of use they are similar to all biocellulose drivers but without that edge or less so than others like the THTH etc. Bass is linear little warm bump to balance out the rough treble something that rarely happens with Biocellulose drivers. Treble is extended gives a dark impression but isnt technically dark at all. They lack air sound closed a bit narrow but fairly even in their response. They are one of my fav headphones and one thing Zeos didnt mention is how low the distortion is very clean. My one complaint is the tuning in a closed headphone will affect the presence of vocals usually in a closed headphone that tuning will work better but its a nitpick because it does a lot of things very well. I would prob keep them if I didnt prefer open headphones and Ill prob own them again.,headphones,d46f631,1,t5_2rcyx

I know you didnt ask for advice or directions but to save you the hassle of looking up a how toTechnically a mistake in either direction is reversible but the idea would be to insert REALLY think about where the problem areas seem to be and grind or layer on.The layering has to be done one thin layer at a time so its REALLY time consuming. Layer wait for it to completely dry test by inserting into ear canal think about where the problem area is now should still be pretty much in the same area because I doubt one layer is enough to fix the issue. Repeat until satisfied. Same thing with the sandinggrinding down. Think about where in the canal it is too snug. Sand it a little remove debrisdust shine it if you care to insert. Still too snug? Repeat as necessary.If you layer on too much acetone in a well vented area. But you basically gotta start over if you make this mistake and want to be able to keep track of how exactly how many coats you are adding.If you grind too much theres always the clear nail polish.Once again best of luck!,headphones,d4kgdsk,1,t5_2rcyx

This caught my attention as I was going for HD s and made me wonder would the Philips SHP beat the HD ? Please do not consider valueprice to performance and focus as if both products were the same price. Some more information to answer this question for me can be listed below.A bit of an unorthodox question so leaving some things out of the format.Source  Onboard sound with desktop motherboard MSI Z Gaming  with Direct Audio Power if that even makes a difference doubt it doesPreferred tonal balance  Think a bit more balancedneutral set of headphones is what I am going for. However I am not very sure and think my preferred music choice and my history of past headphones would be a better place to look then what I have written here.Past headphones  Been using the HD s and they were a fine set of headphones. Build quality was a bit flimsy as goes to many of Sennheisers more budget headphones but the sound quality was quite decent at least for my ears. I dont have much to complain about the s but I do know that I can still get better sound with a new pair of cans. Praising the HD s can maybe show on what kind of sound signature that I would prefer.Preferred Music  EDM and electronic music is definitely a big thing I listen to with some rock classical and maybe some pop music on the side. From the variety of music choices Im guessing a balanced sound signature is best but am not very sure.,headphones,d4xn9a0,1,t5_2rcyx

Id recommend the DT for metal if thats an option and if you prefer highhighs.For the SHP I know what you mean. The  does distortion guitars really well but I think youll find the X does them as good also. Guitars are really the only thing the  has going for it. I look at the X as an upgraded . Sparkly is not a word I would use to describe the X though. Maybe on certain things sure but generally no. Even the s are more sparkly. What I believe youre referring to is the highs.

THX still has great treble energy on par with the HD and a bit more than the HD. The Fostex are the most fun headphones Ive listened to. Soundstage is actually pretty wide for a semiclosed design. About on par or a bit narrower than the HD but imaging is very very good.

8347884,0,t3_4txd95,About a month ago I searched around a while for a new pair of headphones because I felt my s lacked a certain impact in the lower range. I ended up picking up some Denon AHDs and boy do they thump. Here are some of my impressions after a month.Build and Comfort The headphone is well made. The headphones are constructed out of wood and metal and though they dont feel industrial and probably couldnt take a real beating definitely hold up to day to day usage at home. They have a sturdy braided cable that feels premium and well made. The comfort in a word is adequate. Being used to the ultra light Sennheiser s it was hard for me to transition to this thin headband and heavy headphone. After a few hours of use the weight starts to be a little too much. Other than that they are fine. The earcups fit well against my head aided by the swiveling cup design and it has good adjustable headband height on the sides.Isolation and Microphonics The headphones dont isolate all too well because they dont clamp on the sides of the head like some other closed back headphones. However that being said they isolate better than an open back headphone. I can still kinda hear my keyboard typing MX Blues if Im listening to music at a moderate volume. They do leak a little sound. People right near me can hear music though they usually cannot tell specific details. I use these for home use so it doesnt make as much of a difference to me. Microphonics are pretty much negated by the braided cable which is very nice. Sound And now for what youve all been waiting for. I am in love with these headphones sound. These have AMAZING bass impact. Damn! Its really incredible how precise and accurate all the bass impacts feel. I would describe this as a warm headphone. The midrange is a little recessed and not as prominent as the low range but not bad. Highs are smooth but accurate which is a little hard to explain. The upper range moves and flows nicely but also feels very precise and tight. I have heard the lower range described as more loose and less controlled than its younger brother the AHD but Ive never heard the D so I cant comment. Honestly the bass range is one of the tightest and controlled Ive heard with incredibly succinct bass impact. Overall a really awesome headphone with uniquely well done bass impact. Thats all I have for impressions. Ask me anything else if you wish!,headphones,d5l1e9a,3,t5_2rcyx

8405265,0,t1_d5pgfja,I think the original HyperX Cloud is the Pro . Its pretty much the exact same headphone just rebranded by HyperX with a mic included. Even though most gaming headsets are tuned for heavy bass these are not basshead headphones. HiFi headphones can be bass heavy light or neutral. Quality sound doesnt only come in one sound signature. Its all preference from there. If you dont like bass heavy like me dont go for that signature.Also gaming headsets are headphones like any other they just have a mic and an immature overly futuristic look which is a bit of a shame.Talking about Superlux I actually own a pair of HD EVOs. They actually sound pretty great once you do the foam mod. Great soundstage a bit on the warmer side but still relatively neutral. They just have awful comfort and the build quality is the worst Ive ever seen in a headphone. Now does it sound better than the Pro  which is exactly the same as the original HyperX Cloud people just may be biased because of the gaming headset stereotype. I cant tell because I never tried the Pro . However many people love it.Im not certain but the Cloud Core looks like the original Cloud. In which case it should be the same as the Pro . It is possible for  headphones to sound different with the same driver. The driver is only part of the story. As I said cup shapematerials venting damping driver positioning make an extremely significant difference in sound. However when comparing the Cloud and Pro  all of those factors seem to remain unchanged. But you could do some research HyperX Cloud vs Pro  as I havent looked that up in detail.All that being said you could also consider the Somic V. Best sub headphone I ever heard. Build is also incredible. I just hate the M nondetachable cable but apart from that its awesome value. Its an open headphone. Sound signature overall is a bit bassshy which contributes to midhigh clarity and treble is detailed but sometimes piercing. However the mids are insane. Im talking comparable to Sennheiser HD mids. You wont be disappointed by them theyre lovely.Cheers.,headphones,d5s7c8p,1,t5_2rcyx

At the moment I have the HD s which are good enough considering their price. One thing that I dont enjoy about the HD s though is their flat response. How do Momentum .s compare in that regard? Are they worth the upgrade in general? I understand that theyre balanced headphones as well but I wonder if theyre at least a little more pronounced on basses than the HD .Many thanks,headphones,d5x82c7,1,t5_2rcyx

I now being orthodynamic headphones many will think that theyll need a lot of power to open up but the designers at Oppo really worked on the efficiency of these headphones and they do sound quite spectacular out of your cell phone.Pm won second or first depending what you read in the post.

Im pretty sure part of the audio is pumped through the tube because if you are playing music and then flip on the amp its silent and slowly comes in distorted very badly until it warms up about  or  seconds before its at the proper clarity and set volume.,headphones,d5xz4hk,1,t5_2rcyx

I guess a better way to phrase it would be Im looking for an amp with clean solid state character but I also like tube sound from time to time. So one option is to buy the class A solid state amp then add a pure tube amp in the future.The dollar amounts between amps are not a factor in the decision here Im more concerned with getting the right equipment for my application which is why Im here looking for opinions.I addressed the DAC thing in another comment but to reiterate Im really only trying to make a decision on amp.

8625272,0,t3_4xo0nv,Hi guysNot quite sure if this belongs here or if I should make a separate threadIm currently demoing a pair of JH CIEMs as in a universal version of the JH vs. The pair came with both silicone and foam tips. With the silicone tips the pair is a bit hotsibilant and the mids are slightly sucked out. With the foam tips the highs are tamed the sibilance is gone and the mids are brought back in. Ergo they sound waay better with the foam tips than the silicone tips.My concern is what is actually representative of what the CIEM will sound like as the sound changes pretty substantially. One of their helpful spokesperson has told me that it comes down to what fits the best but its hard to tell given that both pairs of tips fit quite well. Of course the foam is more conforming to the inside of my ear while the silicone tips form more of a vacuumtype of seal. Essentially if the custom version ends up sounding like the foam tips theyre my perfect endgame CIEM. If they end up sounding like the silicone tips theyre a bit too hot.

8712172,0,t3_4zc09x,Budget   ideally. Can go higher if its a VERY nice comfy pair.Source  Home computer will be for gaminggeneral use on a desktop streaming.Requirements for isolation  Nice to have since I use a desk mic and use it in a basement. Someone does sit right next to me so Id prefer for the sound from my headphones to not leak out to them.Will you be using in public? No not at all.Preferred type of headphones? Closed onear? Maybe overear if those are even more comfortable? The only set Ive ever owned for any stretch of time are Sennheiser P which is a headset and they are as comfortable as can be. My ears never hurt because the padding is so thick and comfortable. Mostly I am concerned about comfort as I wear them for hours on end. I will say that it will have to be a .mm jack because of being used in a PC.Preferred tonal balance  Kinda neutral I guess? Never had a high enough quality setup to where I could knowtell this. Not really certain. Call me open to suggestions here.Preferred Music  Metal mostly.What would you like to improve on your from your setup  Just a better if possible more comfortable higher quality headphones that will last me for years.

8783319,0,t3_50ajsp,Hey everyone! I need some advice or opinions on which headphones to pick from these two Audio Technica ADx or Audio Technica Rx. I just got both of them today and Im conflicted between the two. I like how natural and full bodied the Rx sounds but on some songs the mids seem to be drowned out. I like the ADx because the mids are prominent on most songs but the bass seems a little less than on the Rx. The ADx also sounds very different from any other headphones Ive listened to before. The Rx fit is perfect on my head but the ADx feels like its sliding down my head. I could get some thicker earpads to fix that issue though. If anyone has any experience with either of these please comment! Thanks!,headphones,d73l52b,1,t5_2rcyx

8892140,0,t1_d7gkaj1,In concept it sounds good but that means one more thing for the manufacturer to take account of. What if a headphone had excellent drivers and would sound excellent if it was used passively through .mm but the DACAMP included is either poor quality or alters the signature such that it is not to everyones tastes? What will happen to DACAMP pairing on devices?These are problems currently faced with Noise Cancelling and Bluetooth headphones which have a builtin DSP and are tuned for those features. They usually sound worse if used wired and without any power yet a passiveonly version of the same headphone is often preferred as some people can pick out DSP artifacts or differences in the signature.,headphones,d7gpjar,1,t5_2rcyx

8899414,0,t3_525zae,There have been multiple mods posted Audezestyle where you are putting a pair of  pin minis on the bottom of the cups but I didnt want to go through the hassle of patching and painting the cups. Once I found a right angle mini XLR I knew I had to try modding them.Due to the tight space constraints and limited length of existing wiring to work with this is a mod with a fairly high difficulty level. Doing it you feel like you need about  hands.I believe it makes a difference in sound quality but it definitely makes a difference in durability.

8924489,0,t1_d7kjz7h,Well Im brand new to this so Im not really sure what Im doing .From reading about new iPhone  and audio. The DAC is suppose to be in the  adapter that comes included which attaches to the lightning port.From some other reading I just did earlier apparently this could end up even better for audio people than thought because lightning port can output more power than standard headphone jack. So it has the potential that it could end up better sound from iPhone than previous models with headphone jacks.So I dont know how much is to gain by external DAC? Maybe the DAC is sufficient and a bigger amp would be better?I guess really I would just have to wait for people to tear the  adapter apart find out what type of DAC chip it is and what it would compare to amp if its worth bypassing for aftermarket. ,headphones,d7klcit,1,t5_2rcyx

9044840,0,t1_d7z0wzq,And thats fine.  You dont have to let anybody convince you and its definitely your right to not try it.But you cant then go and say that they dont sound the same or at least vastly similar if you dont have the experience to back up that claim.  Its okay to be concerned about it but I can tell you from my experience that its something that just isnt the case.  You definitely dont have to go with CIEMs most people wont but you shouldnt let a possible sound change be a reason for why you arent doing it.  There are plenty of reasons to not get a CIEM that dont rely on something that isnt actually true.  Trust me and feel free to ask others who have CIEMs  youll get the same answer if you can get yourself to a universal demo of a CIEM your final CIEM will sound vastly the same as the demo unit you heard.  That of course doesnt take away from having to still hear the demo so thats still a risk you undertake if you buy a custom without first listening to a demo but if you do actually hear a demo first and like it you will get the same sound in the custom and you will still like what you heard.My point is that universal demos of customs DO in fact sound almost exactly in line with what you get in a custom and I know this from experience.

I want to use this pair to listen to musicmovies but primarly to play games fps so sound dimension where the sound comes from around me is something important. Other aspects I would like to haveComfortable I can wear them all day long up to  hours a day. I want the foam to keep its shape not to feel whatever is under.I want them to isolate sound not as important I dont know the perks of having open headphones would be nice if I could take them out also not that important could always take my current pair of heaphone which is super portable.I want a good range good bass and good treble all headphones I saw recommended had some lacking on some end of the sound spectrum.Sturdy like I said I dont buy headphones often I want them to last.  CAD I dont mind spending money on quality.Can run from the audio jack of my computersound system.

I own the dt ohm and I feel its a very good closed headphone. I have heard the mx which imo is not deserving of its hype. at all. its not bad and better then beats but people talk about it as if it were the be all and end all. But Ive only listened to mx for maybe four hours. im not sure about the ohm but the ohm cord is not replaceable. but you can modify this and probably any headphone if you have the skill and dont mind voiding warranty. this is just my opinion. google some reviews on dt vs mx,headphones,d93r4e4,1,t5_2rcyx

You want it to sound like as accurate as possible to the samples and any coloration from your headphones will make it sound more artificial. If you have to stray from neutral go towards the brighter signatures. As long as its not too boomy.I also spent countless hours playing digital pianos with headphones and can say that comfortable open headphones are the way to go.So for pretty neutral open and comfortable headphones Id say HD. HD would be even better but amplifying it might be difficult depending on your digital pianos outputs.,headphones,d9c7xic,9,t5_2rcyx

9464008,0,t3_5acjfg,Really the biggest thing is digital vs analogue samples. Analouge sounds much much better.  I think it has to do with the compression of digital sound. Since it isnt lossless to begin with sound quality takes a big hit when you recompress a digital file.  Its tough to explain but maybe if you hear enough good production youll pick up on it. Also IMO dre is way overrated.  Check out Madlib J Dilla prince paul Pete rock subroc and MF DOOM. Even people like Panda Bear have that high quality production sound.

9503763,0,t1_d9k87xe,The Rock Zircon is ridiculously engaging it fitsisolates both cable up and down phenomenally and is built better than the KZ. Absolutely go for it the sound just gets you going. The bass is super elevated bordering insanity on an amp with a high output impedance the midrange is warm but a little recessed and treble is well defined but not piercing at all. They arent Vshaped just fun bass cannons haha. The Xiaomi Piston  is a more mature sounding and comfy easy to listen to IEM with good midrange body and a nice stage considering form factor. Lower treble is a bit peaky and subbass is lacking but its still excellent. It sounds very different from the Zircon and I feel like both compliment eachother so well. Funny you mentioned them both because I have so many chinese IEMs over  and these together get at least  of the ear time.Go for the Zircon and if you manage to find it also grab a Piston !,headphones,d9kji07,2,t5_2rcyx

You mentioned in another answer it was hard to stand out with all the other cans out there. We all know the headphone industry has grown do you think it is reaching a saturation point soon? I was so surprised to hear AKG is probably closing its doors.

9572935,0,t3_5c2abu,These came two days ago and Ive been comparing them to the VE Monk via my iPhone SE and Headroom Micro Amp. The Yuin Pks performance improves even less when amped than the Monks does. Overall the Yuin has a much more refined midrange and treble. Acoustic instruments have more air and sound a little more natural. I can see why the Yuin Pk has been recommended online for those who dislike IEMs for the better part of a decade. However that refinement comes at a compromise especially compared to the Monk. What the Monk lacks in refinement it does make up for a more balanced sound with bass that goes a little lower than the Yuin offering more body and presence. The bass really comes out of the Monk when its amped and youre in a relatively quiet environment. On the street with more ambient noise the Yuin and the Monk are much closer together in bass performance and perhaps the Yuin may even take the edge where its refinement may come more to the fore front. However prices in Amazon hover around . The price on Massdrop was about . The VE Monk is still . The only other counterpoint to the Monks value proposition is that the Yuins bud is slightly smaller. I didnt realize how big the Monks were until I let my partner listen to them to see if shed like a pair. They barely fit in her ears. So for the Yuin there is that. Im going to continue enjoying them though. Below is a playlist I have been listening to both the Monk and the Pk with called Jazztronica.

Budget   max would be perfect can go up to  hard cap if really needed and relevant considering  what I listen and my devices Source   Actually it would mainly be an Iphone and my laptop. Im planning on a dedicated portable player but not in the near future. Requirements for Isolation  These would be my anywhereanytime headphones office home public transportations etc. so yeah isolation is required both from the outside noise and from the headphones to the outside tldr  need closed headphones.  Preferred Type of Headphone  Fullsized nothing else. Comfort is a really important point since I could listen music on a really long period that lovely  a.m.   p.m. working day Preferred tonal balance  This is the most difficult point to me since I have no real idea of how my past headphones are balanced. I would say bassywarm but without detriment over mid and treble. Past headphones  JVC HA and JVC HA. Bought the second because the first died without any warning but I didnt had time to depply search for a new model. Preferred Music  Mostly Metal like Meshuggah Obscura Korn Opeth Tool... What would you like to improve on from your setup  As said comfort is really important. People on the outside even in my office should not hear my music. My current headphones seems to have a notsogood sound definition not sure about this term should I say precision ? like sometimes it sounds a bit blurry but could it just be because Im using an Iphone ? tldr would be just overall better headphones I guess Location  Im from France that could explains the notthatgreat english writingThanks in advance to anyone who could give me any help !,headphones,d9vx8q9,1,t5_2rcyx

They will also require an amp to get the best sound and one sufficient for them is going to cost somewhere around  at the minimum. Schiit Magni  or Objective .  The HD  is very revealing of the music analytical and many praise it for these qualities but it isnt  for everyone.  They arent forgiving of poorly mastered music.  I cant see the HD pairing up well with rock hiphop or rap at all but for classical or acoustic music they would excel.All that said the HD  is a headphone most want to try at some point if only to see if they live up to their reputation.  To give them a fair shot you need a good source and a good amp.

9779858,0,t1_daikc91,I have no idea what the rest of your equipment is and you mentioned mixing music so it was possible you had a player or hardware mixer with a good DAC already.  Everything that plays digital files has some sort of DAC and amp built into it computers tablets phones you name it.  Many of those do not have the power for the  ohm HD  but the DAC might actually be pretty good.  Very very few people will tell you to use a computer or phone DAC with this level of headphone but as a starting point for those who cannot afford both a DAC and amp at first it can be done if only as a stopgap measure.There was a blind test done at Toms Hardware where the participants couldnt tell the difference between a  DAC and the onboard audio of their computer.  Not consistently.

I ended up having to use sandpaper to fix mine since I didnt want to return them.The controls are an acquired taste they seem tricky at first but after some use I get close to  efficacy at least in mutepausevol upvol down. I dont skip or FFWRW much but it should be OK with practice.In terms of use cases theyre clearly better to commutetravel but in over a month I havent had a chance to do that once so Ive been using them mostly at home while doing stuff that makes full sized cans impractical cooking etc. Also ended up using ANC in very weird use cases... when some construction guys were drilling stuff while vacuuming etc and they do bring a lot of peace.I see your point but in this case I wouldnt find the controls a gimmick they are actually very useful.

9852381,0,t1_darhjhv,It depends on what kind of tube amp.Most tube headphone amps dont have output transformers and typically pair up better with higher impedance headphones such as the DT   ohm. Tubes like to swing voltage but have a hard time delivering lots of current without a transformer to match up the load.Planar magnetic headphones can have low sensativity coupled with relatively low impedances. This requires a relatively high capability to sourcesink current which most tube headphone amplifiers cant do well.Id go with a class A solidstate amp. There are at least  on the market I can think of off the top of my head which would pair well with a planar magnetic driver headphone in your price range.

9866026,0,t3_5gld0l,Hello!Im a bit new to the audio world as I never had the money before to buy a decent pair of headphones. Having that said I purchased  completely different pairs to see what I like and return the ones I dont. Now I already returned the ones that didnt suit my style but the other ones is what Im unsure about.They are AudioTechnica ATH MX. I do like how they sound but to some extent it feels like they have way too little bass could be due to the fact I was using cheap headphones before that and also the highs after k seemed like they were missing a bit. So in order to tune them for my taste I did this equalizer which improved the sound quite a lot for me. Ive read a lot on the internet and everyone keeps saying if you have to use an equalizer to get the sound you like  you should return the headphones. Im not sure about that tho. My question is should I return them and if yes  what would your suggestion be for an alternative? It just seems like the built in EQ settings are just not aggressive enough for my likings. Any ideas would be appreciated! Thanks! ,headphones,datkdtp,1,t5_2rcyx

I prefer warm sounding headphones over vshaped headphones. Overall clarity and resolution is better on the HP. Cleaner bass. One might say that its weaknesses are lack of air in the treble and small soundstage. The K is vshaped. It has a treble emphasis and a bigger midbass bump which can make the bass sound thumpier but also can bleed into the lower mids. The Mx sounds similar to the K Might be slightly less vshaped but I dont remember exactly. They were kind of tight on my ears and head and the HP is more comfortable. ,headphones,dazvyz6,1,t5_2rcyx

9968914,0,t1_db6w4ez,Your motherboard uses the Realtek ALC  codec which is a mid level audio component for motherboards these days.  I have the same one on mine.  How good it is for headphones really depends on the implementation on your particular model which is damn near impossible for anyone to speculate about blindly.  It can be good or mediocre.Your headphones dont normally need an amp and improve only slightly with one.  The DAC built into your motherboard is ok but again I cannot speculate on how well it is shielded from internal electronic noise with this particular board.  If you can afford an external DACAmp then the Fiio EK or the Schiit Fulla or Fulla  would be plenty for the HD .  I cannot promise a wow moment when switching to one of them however.  The sound of the HD  may just not suit your preferences.  They are a bit bass light which can be adjusted to some extent using EQ.,headphones,db6z57v,1,t5_2rcyx

10007231,0,t1_dbbynpo,That makes sense. I initially went hunting for advice about the best female vocal headphones. Got a recommendation of Hd or HE. So I then found the HE in reviews seemed to be regarded almost universally better. And Ive been listening to a lot of classic rock and different music lately. So that seemed like a good choice. But its like I jumped into a ball pit picked up one ball and said this seems good. There are endless options. Expensive ones too x. Ill have to take the journey and explore. What about amping? I hear a lot of people talk about super expensive amps being worth while but then theres always the argument that you get the same sound from a much cheaper amp. And there are a ton of options there too. Is it just coloration that people want? Or is there more to it.

What stood out for me is the handy threebutton remote to shuffle between tracks pause and change volume also offers full platform support. The general sound quality is crisp and clean with the bass is just full without being ovepowering. The general build is good and at under  US the headphone comes with  pair of ear tips of various sizes a cable clip and a carrying case.

10083803,0,t3_5k6sd6,Didnt post impressions as well my bad. Lets see. First of all these things are really heavy. The metal and the drivers feel weighty in your hands before you put them on. As these were my first IEMs it was a struggle to actually put them in to where they looped around my ear and such. After that they were fine. Upon insertion into my ear canal the seal felt relatively good. I got minor irritation after watching four hours of a TV show in one sitting mainly from the metal almost scraping against my outer ear. That kind of sucked but after some very minor adjustments which took less than a few seconds I was ready to go again. Seal even after such a long listening session granted almost entirely motionless remained relatively good especially considered I havent bothered to experiment with changing the tips. Actual sound quality these things sound pretty good! The initial listening I did was Netflix audio and kbps music files on my phone so nothing thatll actually mean anything to the IEMs. I could hear more low end and the high end felt more controlled. Probably due to the size of the driver as well as design. Ill post an edit tomorrow after I listen to a few things on my vinyl collection. Funnily enough I have some old powered Beats Executives soon to be replaced by HDs. While they obviously had more low end due to the size of their drivers the active noise cancelling was nothing compared to the seal on these Rs. Really. Additionally probably in part due to the almost certainly lower impedance and distance from my eardrum the Rs had me feeling almost as if they were louder at the same volumes than the Beats which I consider interesting because theyre powered and wont play music without their lovely triple a batteries. Final note if my post is removed I understand. Honest mistake and I respect it if you follow through with the initial mistake I made and the consequences that follow  uUmlautica,headphones,dblxson,7,t5_2rcyx

But like all things in this hobby a lot of it probably just comes down to personal preference...FWIW I have no issues with the quality of SMSL stuff whatsoever my brother who is a huge tinkerer uses a combo of SMSL stuff on his desk. The only reason I didnt get one myself was because they just werent powerful enough to drive planars.Are import fees etc. for the Fulla that bad in Canada? ,headphones,dbqkf5a,1,t5_2rcyx

The midbass is reduced a smidge while the treble seems to gain a little clarity and the subbass definitely tightens with increased impact. In other words the sound is brought just a bit closer to the HD but without the treble peak. The bass and treble extension doesnt quite match the HD nor does the soundstage. The quarter mod is reversible. You just need to find another foam piece and replace the one you cut. Rear foam removal reversible if youre careful but it seems this mod isnt worth it without the rear spider cage removal which is not reversible.

10204484,0,t3_5m45wm,Depends on what headphone you decided to get. Planars generally have much deeper bass and better bass impact. But not all planars have this. HEi will have better bass but nothing like a premium open backed planar. I would look into getting a used he or he. Or if you want the audeze flavor get a used LCD. Anyways I did have an hd when I first got my he. The sound is much more clean and fluid. The seal is also something you gotta get used to. Planars depend on the seal much more than regular dynamic headphones. The pressure on your head is a tad more but its well worth it for that bass. The biggest drawback to planars is the weight.

MOREs have more punchy bass and the highs sound slightly artificial vs the P.  Mids are more recessed.  Ps have a lot more detail all around natural sounding highs with mids that arent too recessed.  From memory P bass extends further but theres less bass present and the bass response is really dependent on getting the right tips.

10248092,0,t3_5mpcdb,To be honest I never assumed inherent differences between all the different brandslevels of gear outside of headphones themselves which I think make up at least  of the listening experience. I say that because its only when I get to higher level headphones hei and hd for me that I noticed source impacting it more. I could hear some differences when plugging into different cell phones computer ports and later DACamps. Now I very much prefer the sound from the DACamp combo I currently own modimagni but when I have to use another source the world doesnt collapse in on me and Im not irritated by the result. Underwhelmed at most especially with something like the i out of my iphone just not enough juice but SQ is pretty good but I never have to listen to the i out of my iphone and my IEMs are amazing so I have all angles covered.

10670704,0,t1_ddgevf7,Id be careful.  I used to wipe pads and headband with lysol too then a beyer headband literally melted on me.  I didnt even soak it in lysol or anything just wiped it with cloth that is dampened with lysol.  It was still enough to cause some sort of chemical reaction and the headband began to get stickymelty.  Another issue is that the smell of lysol never quite goes away even months down the line.  Its not terrible but Id rather not be smelling that stuff every time I put the headphones on.Now I just dampen some cloth with soapy water and use that in place of lysol.  Its lower risk on the headphone material I feel and the smell of soap is a lot nicer vs lysol.,headphones,ddgloxw,3,t5_2rcyx

Also a little less than stock but it sounds different. A more harmonic kind of bass.Midrange Comes through clearer but is more distant. Not as intimate as stock. HE isnt known for mids nway.Treble As crisp as ever. And as sibilant as ever LOL... Not much difference. This is one thing that is tough to fix. But it still sounds great nonetheless.Soundstage Widened just a bit. A tiny bit really.Oh yeah and comfort is also waaaaay better!!I also find that I need to increase the volume by at least  more than stock. Probably because the transducer is further away from my ear.

10729082,0,t3_5thzfc,Full review will be up soon but some brief impressionsDesignI mean look at it. Its awesome. Its a solid block of aluminium that looks like it wants to eat your family. It has line ins preamp outs VU meters and doubles as a headphone stand. Comes in a variety of colours but the flatblack is pure evil and awesome. Its the only time Ive left a headphone amp on my desk that made my fiance say Im not entirely comfortable with that thing hanging around our babyI personally think Its really cool that unique designs like this are coming out of the industry. IMHO we need more crazy out there stuff like this. GradoEffortlessly driven. Seriously large amount of headroom. Adds a slight amount of warmth to the token Grado signature. Not many clicks to choose from volume wise. Doesnt sound like there is a very large output impedance seems to drive the Grado low impedance headphones fairly accurately without messing around with the frequency response too badly. Soundstage is healthy and wide not too many issues with crosstalk or anything like that. Audeze LCD .Excellent scale is demonstrated here. Keeping the visceral signature thump of the LCD . whilst still pumping details out.Plenty of headroom for these cans.Bass extends and reaches far down into sub territory with ease. Shedloads of power to pull from. Playing drum and bass or high energy music just twisting the volume knob and enjoying watching the VU meters try to keep up is great fun.Or even with softer more dynamic tunes the amp has plenty of dynamic range to scale from.HDSMatching with the HDS is no easy task but once again the evil looking skull manages to scale itself really neatly. There are no awkward dips or humps in frequency response. Extraordinary detail retrieval.Very high gain probably not as much volume range to select from one might be looking for  volume adjustment on the DAC might be an option here unless Ive missed a setting somewhere on the Marquis.Effortlessly drives the HDS great pairing.

The Mxs I had were appropriate and they can leak a bit from experience.Will you be using these Headphones in Public  YepPreferred type of headphone  Over ear preferred from a comfort standpoint but willing to go onear if that box is checked heavy clamping pressure from on ear  glasses can lead to some pain the upper ear lobe from past experiencePreferred tonal balance  Really unsure here. Almost impossible to demo headphones around here one shop that had anything only has Audeze. Magnolia had a pair of Momentum s Ms MDRA. Did not like the Ms at all. I like my bass but not that much bass...it just sounded muddled possibly a source issue. I found the A to be a bit boring and drawn back during my listening much preferred the momentums signature at the time. I dont dislike the U shape of my dts but less recessed mids would be nice. That all said I figure something neutralwarm would fit the bill. Warm coloring might tick the fun box a bit more.Past headphones  Grado HF  they certainly do what theyre meant to. Wish they had more bass extension. Beyer DT  ohm need to be repaired  havent listened in awhile since I havent had time to repair and they were my first real headphones so my past experience is skewed here. Fast clarity lacking a bit of bass and midrange but well defined. Never found the treble to be bothersome. ATHMx sold  found them to be a bit muddy in the midrangebass solid thump and rumble but no well defined clarity and attack got boring to listen to after awhile compared to the DTs but a solid solution on the go and for work.Preferred Music  Most common rockmetalpopedm. Classical and jazz always find their way in as well. Basically no countryrap....What would you like to improve on from your setup  Upgrade over the Mx as detailed aboveHeadphones I have been reading aboutconsidering were the PMs Audeze Sine impressions seem to be across the board with these  the cipher cable Shure  cant get a read on these...each review seems to contradict the other...

I totally would prefer the HDs from what Ive heard but theyre pretty much out of my budget. The AKGs sound pretty nice but Im not sure if I totally like them. They feel a bit distant I will have to get used to such little bass and the wide soundstage seems overdone sometimes. But overall I thought that this should be the best headphones that I could get for this price. Or would you have any other recommendations? Because I could still return my AKGs...Another idea I had is to return my s and to buy a HD but then without an Amp and DAC. Would you say this is the better option for me? A bit more information My headphones will be used for everyday listening but also music production including mixing...so they should be quite flat but still fun to listen to.  Ive not set a straight budget but Id like to keep it under  for the headphones.  I dont have an AmpDAC yet and Ive not tested the AKG Ks with an Amp yet so that might give another improvement?

If youre open to the idea of that the Philips SHPS with a Vmoda Boom Pro is about one of the best choices you can make around your budget.If you really want to have that closed headphones which also have benefits since closed headphones can be used in public unlike open headphones then something like the ATH MX or even Sennheiser C are worth looking into.

11033663,0,t1_deimg3s,one cool thing about ANC headsets these days is that turning ANC on doesnt seem to affect the music.As recently as last year id review ANC headphones and a large part of the review was about how much you sacrifice in sound quality.This past week Ive received headphones from Pioneer and BEEM both lightning IEMS and purchased the X for review. All of them have really no change in the music I can detect....OR at least its subtle enough that if youre in a situation where you need ANC  it wont matter.cool stuff really.I grew up with Sony and AIWA headphones.

If I keep the knob down lower then will it be fine if Im using lower impedance cans?Maybe Ill just jump on the Frys deal for the Creative Sound Blaster E for the time being and then when I get some higher end headphones upgrade.I forgot to say that I have a pair of Sennheiser PC  Special Editions that I just think sound like complete garbage. They sound like literal tin cans. They have no low or mid and seem to leak from the bottom because they dont create a good seal. Although last night I had them fairly firmly against my head and it still sounded like they were hollow.

11378637,0,t1_dflbvy2,At this point in their development its personal choice in the design language and how dependent you are with iMessage.I used an Android device up until few months ago when I broke my phone and had to use a spare iPhone  lying around at home. While I made an okay transition and am alright for the most part using an iOS device I feel suffocated at times with how far they push the minimal simplistic design at the sacrifice of functionality in the form of notifications I absolutely despise the way notifications are handled in iOS. The notification badge count in home screen is nice though. App wise the really popular apps the iOS devs tend to pump out a better app than the Android devs do for the same app but aside from some apps like Snapchat though I heard it got better in recent beta releases its not that different in quality. Biggest problem with iOS I find is that Im a lot slower  less productive on it. There are very little short cuts using long pressswipes and what not with the OS itself and the apps that use the design language iOS enforces so I find myself taking  extra actions to achieve the same thing I used to on my android device manually turning data off selecting wifi. When you do that action multiple times a day it adds up and you really feel the loss in productivity. This could have changed in the latter versions along with force touch. Also iOS has absolute garbage reddit apps which can be a small to big con depending on how often you reddit on your phone.Biggest problem with android is device support. Google Pixels have  year support while other manufacturers are willy nilly about how welllong theyre going to support the device. This is the reason for such big variances in experience and performance between devices.,headphones,dflqzmw,2,t5_2rcyx

11484361,0,t1_dfxbqn3,There is a plugin for foobar on that page which can analyze the loudness of songs. Simplifying it compares the loudest parts of the song to the average loudness of the song and assigns a DR value for that song. The values can be from   almost no difference in loudness e.g. whisper and scream sound equally loud this is a brickwall that people mention in other posts to   big differences in loudness so whisper is whisper and scream is screamThe plugin generates a report like you can see in the lower part of the link I sent. From that the page computes min max and average DR for the album. You can search by artist or album top of the page and see which one are heavily compressed and which are not e.g. Carly Rae Jepsen Fleetwood Mac As they write on the main page they currently have  albums in their database.To visualize it better lets compare Carly Rae Jepsen  Boy Problems  probably ripped from CD Carly Rae Jepsen  Boy Problems  official youtube version different mastering! Fleetwood Mac  Everywhere  from  My dr plugin tells me that DR values for those songs are   and . If you look at the waveforms  you can see the difference.As for listening to me songs with higher DR are less tiring. For example if I tried to listen to Boy Problems and Everywhere in a loop then in order to not get a headache I would have to lower the volume of Boy Problems to the level where I would perceive it as much quieter than Everywhere.,headphones,dfxr11h,3,t5_2rcyx

I wear them every day biking to work and traffic can sometimes be loud.Will you be using these Headphones in Public?  YesPreferred Type of Headphone  IEM. My primary headphones are the Sennheiser HD IIs which I absolutely love.Preferred tonal balance  Heavier on the bass. I mostly listen to metal rock and electronic musicPast headphones  Senn HD II. They have a great response range for the music I enjoy and I like that theyre basically so simple that I can replace any part on them if they wear down. As far as IEMs go Im currently using some cheapo SkullCandys one ear just gave out after mo daily use and had some RHA Ms before that. I like the bassier side of the SkullCandys since the RHAs were more neutral than I like. Both of them however had really weak build quality and broke in the first  months of use.Preferred Music  Tesseract  random EDM mixes  five finger death punch What would you like to improve on from your setup  Build quality is huge for me right now. Im getting tired of the cheapos that sound meh and still give out quickly. I also do the overear wrap to minimize the sound of the cable vibrations while Im biking so an actual overear headphone is a plus.Thanks in advance for the help!,headphones,dgjrm8l,1,t5_2rcyx

Because of the complex sound environment of headphones in a small closed space between driver and ear with pads pinna etc. CSD ridges arent always consistent with FR. Sometimes well see an FR null which is really a CSD ridge in disguise. Other aspects such how internal cup reflections are addressed can be assessed in the Hz  .kHz area past ms.
