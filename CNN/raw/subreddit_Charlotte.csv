Unless your destination lies directly on your bus route you have to ride to the transit center first before going back out. As an example I live about four miles from downtown. If I wanted to go ten miles as the crow fliesWestinghouse Bv for the locals the trip planner on the CATS site pegs that trip at  minutes. Please.Sure you wont get to everything but youll hit a good number of places with no driving. Most nonbreweries will offer other local beers to try.

1083678,0,t1_chrgbxj,I do believe Google has in the past used it in a very progressive manner feeling that low cost fiber would improve low income communities... I would not be shocked to see the most affluent sections of town prioritized less than the low income apt complex sections around independencenorth tryon and the west side with southenddilworth being the lowest priority. Think you run it to one poor apt complex and you just lit up  people with free MB fiber. Very disruptive which is the true goal. Just looking at those fiber hut locations that does seem to be the case.gtGoogle also knew that cost would be an issue for some Kansas City residents when going into its Fiber launch. After all the company comissioned its own comprehensive survey ahead of time showing that  percent of Kansas Citians dont have a home broadband internet connection and that  percent dont have home internet access of any sort not even dialup. Of that  percent  percent are AfricanAmerican  percent have only a high schoollevel education or less and  percent reported earning less than  a year. That compares to  percent of America that has access to the internet and  percent of adults nationally who nonetheless still dont use it.gt And Google made a big point to say that it wanted to use Fiber to help mend this disparity. The Google Fiber project is about making the web better and faster  but its also about making the internet more accessible for people throughout Kansas City wrote Kenneth Carter policy counsel at Google in a blog post about the study. Digital inclusion here is a priority for Google and its clear that its also a priority for community nonprofits and the local government.

Its not like theyre speeding to get ahead... many times theyre moving as they normally would as if they thought it was a turn lane.  I have no idea whats going through their heads.Then of course there are the jackasses that do it to get ahead of everyone who was waiting their turn Im looking at you BMW drivers.

1608594,0,t3_2cnu0z,Stonewall amp Charlottetowne Left turns coming off that offramp do not have the right away. Stop running in front of my car when I have a GREEN LIGHT and then have the nerve to give me the finger. Happens at least once a week. Ive called the city of Charlotte numerous times to ask about the light and they insist that its functioning properly. People seem to forget I assume because theyre coming off a one way that left turns yield. Ive actually checked and the other side does not have a green arrow just a green light for the left turn lane. It needs to either have a yield to oncoming traffic sign or a yellow blinky light so they know to yield to the green arrow people who have the right of way. Giving two ways a green light to go the same direction at the same time is a nightmare and frequently results in yelling road rage and near misses. Im shocked I havent been hit there yet. ,Charlotte,cjhxilp,2,t5_2qo2j

2643011,0,t3_2q7hrd,Unfortunately clothes have a very low resale value supply vastly outpaces demand theyre reasonably durable. Youd have to compete with both regular stores and thrift stores.  Id suggest getting what you can in store credit and buying something a little more easy to sell like maybe a necklace or a camera or something. That might get you more from a pawn shop or on eBayCraigslist.Also dont raise hell at customer service. You catch more flies with honey than vinegar.

The eclipse only lasts a few minutes in any given area.To talk about the odds youre looking at being in an area less than a percentage of the area of the world in a very specific time frame which is a fraction of a percent of your life.

3429553,0,t1_cpj6llh,Its alright. Fairly cheaper than the areas closer to the city center but it comes at the price of being a bit more spread out. You can find most things in the area but you generally have to drive. But Id rather have to drive  minutes into the city twice a month versus  minutes to work in rush hour every day.    Just depends on what you prefer really. I wish I worked in a more foot traffic friendly area but Steele Creek won out in the proscons battle.

Lots of pretty ladies though and IMO most are more down to earth than what you find in say Atlanta or New York. I think the weather and the general worklife balance attitude of the city play into it though. You do get career minded ambitious women but Charlotte is also a great family town. Pretty much all of the women I went to college with that moved here wound up getting married or are in long term relationships most of those have kids.  There are a shit load of bars and they are all over town not like the  block of  bars in downtown that I had when I was .  If you ever feel the need to get your hulk smash on there are a couple of teams in town. I still get a Bside in with Charlotte Rugby at least once a season. There are also going to be a handful of big tournaments here this spring  Small College National Championship qualifier in April and the East Region Club qualifiers in May if youre just looking to watch. ,Charlotte,cpql23i,3,t5_2qo2j

It is also possible that it might be on the grey list where they will only be deemed adoptable if space opens up.  Space is opened up when a dog is adopted or euthanized.If I had the guess just based on breed the best hopes for this guy assuming his owner doesnt come for him is the grey list but he could be euthanized outright.,Charlotte,cqrt8pl,2,t5_2qo2j

What makes this place special that I need to be reading an article about it?  Thats not a bar by the way thats somebodys old shed that they managed to get a liquor license for.I assume that the businesses that are being written about are paying to have something written and then paying a perview on top of that since theres no advertising on the page and because theres little actual content.  If its not out to make money and its just someones hobby they should probably go take some writing classes Ive just managed more readable content in this post than what Ive seen on that site.  ,Charlotte,cr2ryfj,4,t5_2qo2j

I am curious if it has to do with the same reason you can google the content of a WSJ article and they cant display the paywall from a google result but if you link directly you get smacked with the paywall.  Fun fact  I used to subscribe online for the CO and bookmarked the link.

5619441,0,t1_cwtip0h,Technically the bible says nothing about Christmas. The entire idea of Christmas as we know it was stolen from pagans. Lets start with the time of year it is celebrated Dec th. This comes from the Winter Solstice on the Julian calendar it was Dec st rd  Winter Solstice date  and to a lesser degree from Saturnalia which also happens to include the idea of gift giving. There is some debate surrounding the origin of the date as some believe it may have also come from the Roman pagan holiday of Deis Natalis Solis Invict the birthday of the unconquered sun. The Catholic church was having a hard time of getting rid of Pagan beliefs at the time so the merged the two ideas together and declared Christs birthday to be on the th of December to hijack these celebrations. The idea of a Christmas tree also comes in part from the winter solstice. There was a pagan cult the Asheira Cult that worshiped trees. They would also cut them down and bring them into their homes to worship them. During the winter solstice they would decorate them. Mistletoe comes from a mixture of Nordic and Druidic beliefs again pagan. So when you think about it the entire Christmas holiday really is very pagan...,Charlotte,cwtn9bt,8,t5_2qo2j

No fucking clue..We struggle making a left turn while pressing the gas pedal..During rush hour when we happen to be the first car on a line of cars waiting for a green light we dont really pay attention to the traffic light. Our indicator for the light has turned green is when cars behind us start honking. Even then we struggle with the gas pedal.  .On the interstates we get in accidents...a lot. I mean all the time. So much that the map layer on Waze is fully covered with accident reports..We leave our our shitty uninspectedunmaintained cars on the side of the highway when they break down. .We have to be talking on our phones while driving or else we will get a seizure from concentrating on the road. Epically if we are women drivers. No offense ladies just an observation In summary we just dont give a fuck. We drive like were the only ones on the road.

But if your shoulders dont fit on your suit coat its not able to be tailored properly.  I second Myers park Tailor.  Walid does a fantastic job and he wont up sell you for things not required. I actually had an indochino suit made and I took it to him for adjustments.  He pointed out a number of things wrong with the fit and explained the he could do it for me but the cost of those kind of adjustments would likely outweigh the value of what I paid for the suit in the first place.  Im not trying to bash on indochino. I know some folks who have had great success getting things from them I just didnt have a great experience.  I do like suit supply though.

7070248,0,t1_d1hjthh,I would disagree that the previous statusquo was sufficient. Prior to the Charotte ordinance discrimination based on sexual identification and gender identity were allowed just as they are now under the NC state law.  The fact that there were some friendly businesses and occasional family restrooms ignores the point that this is a civil liberties issue.  Not sure what you mean by gender change documentation... There is no official transgender registry. As for why to keep the bathroom policy included there is long history of leaving the transgender community behind in order to further the immediate rights of the lesbian and gay community.  Individuals who do match the stereotypical expectations of gender and sexuality face a common equality challenge. While LGB has finally become more mainstream and accepted it always the responsibility of the majority to ensure the rights of minorities are equally protected. The transgender community is one of the most at risk minorities and they need these protections more than anyone.Also disagree on your bottom line point of do men and women need to be kept separate.  This ignores the fact that trans men are men and trans women are women.  So the simple answer is let women trans and nontrans use the womens facilities and men trans or nontrans use the mens. ,Charlotte,d1hrxkq,3,t5_2qo2j

Here are some of his quotesgtFourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.gtLabor is prior to and independent of capital. Capital is only the fruit of labor and could never have existed if labor had not first existed. Labor is the superior of capital and deserves much the higher consideration.gtI see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country. . . . corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.gtThe legitimate object of government is to do for a community of people whatever they need to have done but can not do at all or can not so well do for themselves in their separate and individual capacities. In all that the people can individually do as well for themselves government ought not to interfere. The desirable things which the individuals of a people can not do or can not well do for themselves fall into two classes those which have relation to wrongs and those which have not. Each of these branch off into an infinite variety of subdivisions. The first that in relation to wrongs embraces all crimes misdemeanors and nonperformance of contracts. The other embraces all which in its nature and without wrong requires combined action as public roads and highways public schools charities pauperism orphanage estates of the deceased and the machinery of government itself. From this it appears that if all men were just there still would be some though not so much need for government.Basically if you go back far enough yes the Republicans were for Civil Rights and the Democrats were the racists. See Strom Thurmond if you want to understand how the party changed. But your argument that the Republicans have this rich history of Civil Rights and that the Democrats are the opposite is the dumbest thing Ive read in a while. Try again.And yes Im very aware that folks like Obama and Hillary evolved on this issue. At least they evolved. I too had to evolve on it though I did so about  years ago.I dont have time to argue with you about how much you think the GOP is a champion of the environment or education or health care. I deleted my original comment because I shouldnt have so quickly called you delusional.Now theres proof.

On the one side I understand and very much appreciate what they were trying to do. On the other hand I often times did not feel like a hero. In the life of a combat soldier one of the greatest fears is loosing a brother more so than being injured or killed yourself. I remember coming home on mid tour leave from afghanistan in uniform and people kept calling me a hero or thanking me for my service in the airport. Little did they know I had just watched two friends medevaced from gunshot wounds and one of the special forces guys we were with shot to death. Even though I fought to the honest best of my abilities and their injuriesdeath were in no way my fault I didnt really feel like I should be thanked for my service and I most certainly didnt feel like a hero.While I certainly appreciated the sentiment as do most soldiers I was very internally conflicted. Many soldiers I have talked to have expressed similar feelings. Hope this helps people understand.,Charlotte,d557jpi,6,t5_2qo2j

8621634,0,t3_4xwmlm,If you can afford it  Uptown all the way. If you cannot afford it  roommate  Uptown. My personal experience starts with me buying a house in my very early sliterally  right outside of Huntersville. Rented to some friends who were in college. Had a good time with them and thought it was a good place to be.  We would rarely make the trek uptown since this was preuber and cabs were a sketchy    ride. The surrounding neighbors  were either young parents or older folks without kids.  Mostly just hung out around the local UNCC area bars. They ended up leaving for jobs which left mostly just me up there. At the same time I took a job right near Montford. This led me to hanging out with coworkers who lived in either Uptown or further down in South Charlotte.  This quickly made me realize Id been totally missing out on whole different world of Charlotte. Within two months of this discovery Id rented out my house and moved into a condo Uptown.Fast forward five years latercurrent day and Im about to get married to someone I would have never met had I not made the move. I also have a group of lifetime friends which I made from my building and the surrounding buildings.  Inserting my living area into the middle of the action was crucial to some of the most important elements of my life. Had I stayed in North Charlotte I would not think Id be in as great place Im at in my life today. TLDR North CharlotteHuntersville is okay and nothing to complain about. You will be younger then majority of the population. With you not knowing anyone it is going to be an uphill battle up there.  Uptown is much more happening and geared to your age range. Most of the uptown crowd is just starting their lives in Charlottte so youll be in similar life situations.  DO IT! ,Charlotte,d6jb09a,5,t5_2qo2j

The weather is mild enough here that they dont put the additional cost in to enclose the central parts of the buildings.  Realistically those with enclosed breezeways if not climate controlled will end up being hotter than hades in the summertime and likely increase your utility bill probably imperceptibly.

9028109,0,t3_53sz79,I was at the protest tonight. I want to give yall a few things to consider.  of the people I saw were upset angry but not out to hurt anyone. People were condemning violence and vandalism or like me neutral towards it.. As far as I could tell it wasnt until people dressed in riot gear arrived that things really escalated.. Perhaps the rage and anger isnt coming from from this single incident. I read a sign today that said the videos are new not the violence.. Did you ever talk about police violence before? No really consider that. If you are like me and lived your whole life never knowing anyone who was harassed beat up killed or jailed wrongly did you ever even think about this? Maybe thats why it seems like people are going overboard maybe they have been dealing with this for a long time and we are just seeing them at their breaking point?The protests the riots the violence is a consequence of an unjust system. Maybe you dont believe people of color when they say that police treat them differently but it is fact that our nation doesnt treat everyone the same within the justice system.Whats going on in your city is the result of that unjustness. Its the result of us not doing anything about it because up until now it has not effected us.I dont know what to do and I dont think riots and fires are the right thing to do but I also am not surprised by it. Just look at the top comments on this thread they are dismissive condescending or trying to justify why people shouldnt be angry. If this any representation of the community then its no wonder people are pissed off. Youre neighbors are in pain they are traumatized they are hurting they are angry they feel like their lives dont matter and here you are safe in your home spitting in their eye.Downvote me all you want but know that this is only the beginning.

Because heres how those violent takedowns work  Police get a call or report of violence gt go to the scene gt hopefully find the person.  Listen in to a Chicago police scanner on a friday night.  You hear some pretty random things.  Look at this very well sourced website.  It lists its sources and lines up with the Chicago crime map given by the police etc.  www.heyjackass.com  Look at the  of black assailants to the  of whites assailants.  Look at the chart showing that  of the violence in the city is from white people despite the demographics being an almost even  split between whites hispanics and blacks.  . ,Charlotte,d7xfk8p,1,t5_2qo2j

Curfew extends to the end of the state of emergency which has not yet been lifted its likely bars will close earlier than usual to permit their employees to go home and not be in violation of curfew.I recommend postponing personally.

In most countries there is a long process to demonstrate that you have a particular skill that no one there has or that would specially benefit the country.

But not going through the process and working versus not going through the process working and then demanding equivalent rights is just nonsense in my view and I think hurts the cause more than it helps.

I spent two hours there on a terrible meal that shouldve been like...  minutes tops. During this time. I got told oh you dont wanna know when I asked about what was in their house bloody mary. I just wanted to know which mix they used.. They forgot silverware until  minutes after the meal despite being reminded  times during the meal. My apps never showed up at all. She said oh sorry when told about it as our food arrived.. The server was clearly hungover and hilariously rude. I understand that silverware is an essential part of your dining experience but we just dont have it right now was my favorite line..  minutes from time ordering to receiving food the restaurant was not full or on a wait.. The manager came out to apologize and upon explaining the situation food was good even if late server was horrific she BROUGHT OUT THE SERVER TO APOLOGIZE AS WE STOOD THERE. and asked what they could do better. We explained it wasnt our job to train her staff and we wouldnt be returning. They still charged us for the drinks but comped the food.. The server then came out crying telling us she was going to be fired for this and was so sorry wed had a bad experience. She was trying to get us to apologize to the management for her to save her job. We did not. We still tipped.. Turns out the server had been stealing from other peoples books and was on her last limb anyway. We looked her up she had warrants in multiple states as well for a litany of crimes.It was insane and Im glad they closed. ,Charlotte,debynyg,3,t5_2qo2j

Dinner drinks for the adults a small arcade bowling alleys etc.  A little noisy but something to do.Rivergate does free outdoor movie nights and other events.  I dont see any going on right now but keep an eye on their FB page for updates.  Keep an eye on the Steele Creek Residents Association page  Check for events at the libary and the outlet mall many will be familykid friendly. The Checkers minor league hockey  AHL have about  home games left for the regular season they start a game homestand Friday  which includes games Tues. and Wed. the following week and then their final game homestand starts Tues. and Wed. April th and th check their website for promos and such   It can be difficult to get over there with traffic some nights plan accordingly use Waze or Google Maps and look for alternate routes when you get closer to the facility.  In a similar vein Knights baseball starts up again Thurs.  they have tons of weekday games and from Steele Creek its a quick and easy shot up West Blvd. to Mint street and it takes you straight to the stadium about  minutes drive even during evening rush.Ever go hang out at the airport overlook?

If you do a real cost analysis youre not even making minimum wage while devaluing a very expensive asset. They take what  like ? And give nothing back... No maintenance tires etc. etc. Think about it  theyre basically a taxi service with a multi billion dollar fleet of vehicles that takes a quarter of the money and has absolutely ZERO investment or liability in the cars!

11153501,0,t3_5xbn2n, days later happy to report with my results.  Mixed feelings about the Japanese Cuisine in the City of Charlotte.  Overall it is positive.  Service and environment are not my concerns.I have been to these restaurants  OKu  Musashi  Yama Izakaya  Futo Buta  YUME Bistro  New Zealand Cafe  Mr Toyko Japanese RestaurantPlaces that I want to go but dont have a chance yeta  Lee Cafeb  Ru Sanc  Sushi   OKu   people a little over  with tax and tips  had their Omakase for   each couple nigiri selections and drinks  quality is very good sushi is fresh.  Portion is nice.  Service is good.  good vibes  too dark cant read the menu  I am serious  would I go back again?  maybe just because the items are overpriced and the wait time is not justified with the overall dining experience we had.    Rating  out of   Musashi   adults and  toddlers total is somewhere around  w tax and tips We had Pork Katsu Curry Shoyu Ramen Katsu Don Gyoza and Tonkotsu Ramen.  The pork katsu is great the curry I believe its made out of the curry block thats found at the Asian Supermarket.  The salad looks and tastes fresh.  But there only comes with the curry sauce on the rice plate no veggies.  Katsu Don bento is nice very home Japanese cooking.  Gyoza is what I love in the lunch.  Crispy and very very tasteful.  Shoyu and Tonkotsu ramen.  Very standard not their specialty.  Lean pork very chewy and bland.  Egg is fully cooked not marinaded.  Soup I dont think they boil their pots very likely using soup base for the tonkotsu pork bone flavor.  Kids love their meal I am satisfied with the price and quality of the food.  Didnt try their sushi because mostly are cooked items and the raw selections are very limited.  Rating  out of   Would I go back?  Yes will explain later.    Yama Izakaya  went at late night while my inlaw taking care of our kids total was  with tax and tips.  This place is quiet on a Friday night very surprising.  Ordered Tonkotsu Ramen Shoyu Ramen Takoyaki Kakuni BaoSliders Karaage  Same as the review I read about Yama Izakaya their Kakuni bao using Hoi Sin Sauce I hate sweet sauce and the braised pork belly is really darn small.   of those for ...  hmm...  Takoyaki feel like something is lacking on that dish not enough sauce to kick up the taste.  Karaage chicken nuggets its pretty standard panko fried and spray with salts.  No sauce comes with it though.  Ramen hard boiled marinaded egg.  Ask why its not soft boiled and was told that we can pay extra to get another egg.  no thanks.  Limited vegetables in the bowl.  Presentation is very lacking you have to fish to the bottom to know whats in the bowl.  Chashu is decent and broth is not slurpable!  Side note  very heavy on the MSG  Rating   out of   Will I go back?  Probably not.  I feel like this is a knockoff place of authentic Japanese Food.  More focus on selling alcohol.  Just my feelings.  Futo Buta  Im going to get a lot of flames I think.  total was  with tax and tips  ordered Miso Hungry Ramen Tonkotsu Ramen Pork and Scallop Gyoza and Spicy Tuna Don.  Spicy tuna don.  Sadly this is the best dish we have ordered but the size is so tiny less than  cup of rice.  Worth it?  no.  Look nice?  Definitely.  Pork and scallop gyoza it is very nice dish but I dont really know if its really made with kurobuta pork though...  Miso and Tonkotsu ramen.  By far it is the worst ramen I have eaten in my life that costs over  cents.  The only thing that I like in the bowl was the Pecan smoked Pork Belly it is greasy but its pork belly.  The soup sucks.  Salty and very bland.  imagine you are drinking the boiled water with salty and pork oil  The noodle was made in house but tastes awfully bad.  The noodle needs some salt to balance it not the broth.  I could only ate half of it and my wife ate  of it.  Rating   out of  presentation is  out of   Will I go back?  NOOOOOOO why is this place considered as the best ramen shop in Charlotte?????  The reviews simply arent reflecting the real food quality.  Thats the most scary part of this meal.  Wait was long and hype is high.  Their mixed reviews are evidence on yelp.com  YUME Bistro  VERY surprising find.  Tiny little space.  The wait time is there but not that bad.  Been there twice first with my wife and second with my  toddlers.   for the first time lunch with tax and tips and  for the dinner with my wife and  toddlers.  Ordered Tonkotsu Shio and Spicy Miso Ramen Kakuni bao and Mini Pork Katsu Curry Don for the lunch.  Ordered Thai Curry Ramen Shoyu Ramen Katsu Don Pork Gyoza Shrimp Gyoza Ahi Poke and Hamachi sashimi.  Best ramen noodle I have had.  Its cook perfectly and the noodle is very tasty by itself.  Broth is definitely home cook very thick and sticky.  Spicy Miso can be a bit more spicier and shio has a very nice touch with the garlic paste.  By far the best ramen we have had in Charlotte and its on par with the great ones in LA.  Using pork belly and vegetables corns bean sprouts bamboo and wood ear mushrooms  Soft boiled egg is the killer great taste great textures. Kakuni Bao better value than we had at Yama Izakaya.  Its only  during lunch.   of the price of Yama Izakaya but double the size of their single bun.  Marinaded with dark soy sauce and tops with their house salad sauce.  The bun is really puffy. Mini Pork Katsu Curry.  It is a  add on to the ramen.  Great curry sauce but still no vegetables came with it.  But the pork is thick cut great size and yummy.  Later the evening we went back for more....  The shoyu and thai curry are as good as the previous  bowls we ordered.  Thai curry is a bit too spicy for my wife.  Katsu don close to the best I have had but this one is not in a clay pot its in a rice bowl.  Look darker than the great katsu don I have had in the past but taste is the same.  Soft egg white on the katsu is what makes this dish delicious not overcook egg.  My kids love it and hate me for taking their bites.  Pork gyoza shrimp gyoza they are equally as good and crunchy.  Only . for  pcs with the bowl of ramen.  Great deal  Ahi poke very tasty dish like everyone said on yelp.  The sesame oil makes me want to eat all of it by myself.  Hamachi salad never had the hamachi this way.  wrapped with onions cilantro and top with pepper and masago.  Very unique flavor for this white fish.  doesnt feel as oily with all the greens.  Rating  . out of  wait time is long on Sunday lunch menu is kind of confusing for the first time.  Will I go back?  Yes!  Definitely.  and this is why I put a  on musashi they are both as great but YUME is better overall.  Thanks GizzieMoe for recommending this place otherwise kind of hesitate to go based on the number of reviews on yelp.    New Zealand Cafe  Nice to see some awards on the wall for the best Japanese restaurant many years in a row.  My bill was  Between me and my wife and some intended takeout items to share with my mom.  Rolls as expected are decorated with lot of different sauces.  I am ok with that.  Tried hibachi my wife was surprised on my move.  Not bad at all for the price .  No wonder they are so packed in the late afternoon pm.  Tried about  pcs of the nigiri.  Many premium items like Mirugai bluefin toro and amaebi were not available.  Abalone was not the real thing it is the vegetable premade.  Hotate was yellow and dried.  Bluefin tuna was ok.  Salmon skin rolls are better than I expected.  Overall the sushi items are average.  My overall rating  . out of   Will I go back?  Yes for the party and such this is not a bad choice.  Fairly close to my house too.  And their options are widely covered from Hibachi to sushi rolls to nigiri to sashimi and their appetizer choices are great too on the paper.  Mr Toyko Japanese Restaurant  Total bill was  with tax and tips Me my wife and two kids  All you can eat  Great appetizers do get Grilled Squid Octopus Salad and seaweed salad.  Those are great items to start.  Dont get gyoza and fried tofu.  They are premade cold and the sauce is not good at all.  sashimi costs  cents a piece and they have only  kinds anyway.  Pass.  Rolls are mostly fried items tempura and cooked items.  Rating   out of   Will I go back?  No the food wait time is too long my kids couldnt wait for their food before falling asleep.  Table wait time is long as well.  But for the sub  per person dinner its a bargain if you can eat.After all Musashi and YUME Bistro are the only two I think its as good as those I have had elsewhere in the past.  Price is reasonable.  Food is not overpriced.  Decoration is lacking YUME Bistro has no decoration at all. but the food just speak for itself.  I will update more for the other Japanese restaurant that are on my list.,Charlotte,dew8kau,2,t5_2qo2j

The units are small  sqft and they all face a central courtyard with a pool so it can get a bit loud in the summer when the pools open.

11617307,0,t3_65ry14,So a few things  I checked your post you mentioned with my MOD account and my alt and could see the comments just fine.   I also dont see any comments removed or needing approved in the posts you mentioned.   I also checked to see if your banned and youre not banned. You are also not setup in AutoMOD to be automatically removed. I also see that you have not sent us a PM to discuss your other account.  According to this your account looks normal. As far as My old account was shadow banned and I can no longer post to rcharlotte because I dont share the same views as the moderators I dont know where you got that idea.  Did you get a message that you were banned and not allow to post here? So before you start finger pointing and calling us cowards please reach out to us and provide some accurate data that we can work with.,Charlotte,dgctyqo,19,t5_2qo2j

Obtained a job in Charlotte k salary bump job advancement and increased future opportunities better weather cheaper taxes friendlier people. Lived in Buffalo  years currently residing in Albany for  years. The  months of winter weather and additional months of it just being gray outside alone are enough to move.
