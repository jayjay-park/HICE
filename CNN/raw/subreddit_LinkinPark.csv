448912,1,t1_cfr9h73,Edit Of course. Downvotes for answering the guys question. But hey I forgot opinions arent allowed on reddit unless theyre the same as everyone elses. Listen guys youre downvoting one of your own. Were all LP fans and arguing about which era is better is pointless and stupid.   Woah what? Lost in the Echo is only song I liked off Living Things. Ive been an LP fan for  years and even have a tattoo inspired by them but no matter how much I listened and tried I just couldnt get into Living Things except for Lost in the Echo. Also Iridescent as good as it was is no where close to My December. My December is bone chilling and dark especially the live version. Iridescent starts off dark but then turns into a happy song. Im a huge metalalt rock fan though so maybe thats why Im not really into their more electronic stuff. Its not that I hate it its just not my thing.     When it comes to dubstep I guess the same argument that non metal fans use can be used here. I cant stand all the screaming!! Well I cant stand all the wubs. Theyre kind of annoying. I grew up on Grunge and Alt rock. Pop and electronic music wasnt even allowed in my house haha. I was picked on in school for liking metal and not Britney Spears but I didnt care. All of my friends were metal heads and so were my parents. I suppose I just grew up without that taste for fast happy bubbly music. ,LinkinPark,cfram75,0,t5_2s47y

Somewhere I Belong from Meteora. What Ive Done from Minutes To Midnight. The Catalyst from A Thousand Suns. Burn it Down from Living ThingsBut this... I cant really describe how I feel. The best word I could use was Interesting. Edit Ive listened to it about  or  times now and Im liking it A LOT more than I originally thought.

892064,0,t3_24c1lu,Like LP said before it even came out they knew it was going to start shit among their fans and fracture it. There were still so many people hopeful that the band wasnt going to stray even further from their numetal roots than MtM had already and those are the ones who were most vocally against the album.From my experience with those former fans many still havent given it a second chance and the ones I know who have admit that they dont hate it but they dont consider it to be a Linkin Park album.,LinkinPark,ch5ok7f,5,t5_2s47y

925390,0,t3_24nsr6,Really a hard one although I would probably choose multiple songs from LT and ATS since I havent really been listening to every song except for the ones that stand out. Hybrid Theory Forgotten  Why? Since I listened to Reanimations Forgotten before I listened to the original one and I loved FRGT since the tranquil open sound it has to me totally different from the hard sound Forgotten has.Meteora Love every song but my least favorite is Hit the Floor followed closely by Numb since that was the first LP track Ive heard and Ive heard it hundreds of times now..MTM Valentines Day or In Pieces undecided since I cant say I really like the songsATS The Messenger Does not feel inplace with the rest of the albumLT Victimized No reason,LinkinPark,ch9h01e,1,t5_2s47y

1437906,0,t3_2ajbhg,I should split these up for the sweet sweet karma but I wont. My first LP concert was Feb th  in Portland Oregon. I was . I got into Linkin Park right after the release of Meteora. They opened with With You they did the scream opening as they pulled the curtain down it was amazing. I got to hear Its goin down and I had no idea what it was. Got to see My December live while Mike played on a Grand Piano. And of course the much loved much missed by me anyway Reanimation Bridge during One Step Closer oh it was so good. Set list After that I saw them at Projeckt Revolution  in Mountain View day after my birthday. I was super gung ho about being there early and see every band my friends wanted to skip the openers and see the Simpsons Movie. I said Fuck that and left them to see the show. It was actually really nice to see a show by myself no agendas but my own. Drank a lot of free energy drinks saw Mike driving around in a Golf Cart didnt get to meet him and enjoyed the day. When LP came on though man...what a show. Almost my perfect set list. I got the live version of QWERTY the debut of Hands Held High live and Cure for the Itch. Mmmergred. So good! I was on the lawn and tried to get people to mosh and stuff but people werent into it. Had a blast though.Set list The next year I saw them in Sacramento at ARCO Arena. If I remember correctly the band rose from the stage during the opening songintro Wake. Badass! I got front rowish this time cause I bought floor tickets. Got to hear In Pieces live finally my favorite song off MM or maybe its Hands Held High...shit The Guys totally own the set and killed it that night. Also my wife caught a drumstick. Also Coheed was amazing and now fights LP for my  favorite band. rTheFence shameless plug.Set list In  I saw them in Pomona Ponoma...whatever. Drove  hours. They were part of Epicenter that year opening for TOOL. They played a great set with the band sporting an old school look jeans tshirts in Chesters case IIRC no shirt Got to see DBS which was cool I guess. I swear that at one point Chester looked like he recognized me. The crowd was really rough and by the time LP came on my wife and I had been in the hot LA sun for almost ishish hours so I didnt get to enjoy it as much as I wanted to. Got to have a little LPU meet up before the show and got some free swag. Highlight of the show was during Breaking the Habit the power cut out towards the end of the song and all you could hear was Robs drums. No vocals but the crowd kept on singing and hearing thousands of people singing while seeing Chester and Mike stand in awe watching us finish BTH together even with the ending inflection was a memory I will always cherish. Also seeing Danny Carey Mike and I think it was Brad standing on the sidelines while Alice in Chains performed grinning from ear to ear and acting all gitty was cool to see. Also SteveO was there.Set list Last show I saw them at was the Honda Civic Tour. I went with a buddy and my wife. Seats were good but in Mountain View everyone just sits and then I get yelled at for wanting to stand up and bang my head a little. I cried at the end of Waiting for the End Rob does this drum roll thing while Chester continues to sing holding on to what I havent got! And you just hear his voice soaring over the crowd and everyone has their hands lifted up it was a goddamn spiritual experience. I slow danced with my wife during the LOATRSOTDIridescent medley also tears might have happened while the band sung the let it go part of the song fuck you Frozen LP did it first.  Oh going back to the head banging during the show there was a family sitting next to us that seemed a little out of place the dad was dressed in a button up shirt with a tie and dress pants the mother was in a long dress almost matching her daughter and the son was dressed in a plain Tshirt and jeans. They stayed sitting for almost the whole show. They looked like they were having a good time but still no cheering no head bobbing just a polite clap after every song. Anyway towards the end the son who is on my right starts to stand and watch I see him bob his head a little bit. They end with One Step Closer and Im just going nuts Im jumping up and down Im banging my head Im singing along and finally they come up to the Shut up when Im talking to you and right before that as LP are building up I grab the kids arm and yell in his ear I need you to scream shut up with me use everything youve got pull it from your guts and your heart! And they start...shut up when Im talking to you! And the kid and I go crazy hes pushing against me and singing and pointing and smiling and were rocking out twas glorious. I shook his hand before he left but I didnt get his name.Set list My only regretdisappointment has been that Ive been a LPU member since  and Ive never once been a invited to the Meet and Greets which makes me sad.  years and  shows and I havent met Linkin Park yet. Hopefully this year I have Pit tickets to Wheatland and Im gonna try to get tickets to Concord and take my daughter. I hope it happens this year.

10697327,0,t1_ddj7n5w,I have heard this before while going through some of LPAs MMUs. Its really interesting. You definitely channeled the s style very well. The bridge sounds great. It has a really nice flow. The chorus however seems a little empty. If you couldve incorporated another sound in there I think it wouldve added nicely to the flow. But other than that I really like it.,LinkinPark,ddjclky,3,t5_2s47y

Heck even when BID came out I was like so new so rad in hindsight I dont really like the song too much but for me Heavy or what we heard of it so far was always the type of song where I said to myself thank god LP doesnt do that type of song so now that they did..you can guess how I feel about that.,LinkinPark,ddqsues,4,t5_2s47y
10770481,0,t1_ddqnvac,Yeah its been confirmed that the onemore URL isnt in reference to any sort of finality with the band making music.Its presumably in reference to something else like tomorrows video being something big or just one more video clipteaser.

11288903,0,t1_df5ssar,Id like to respectfully of course ask how much of Fantanos material youve been exposed to. Personally I feel like Fantano does a good job.  He has stated on a number of occasions that his reviews are opinions at the end of the day thats what all reviews really are.  Though I certainly dont agree with all of his reviews either I still think Hesitation Marks by Nine Inch Nails was underrated I think he usually provides decent explanations for why he likes or doesnt like something.  In the case of the review on Battle Symphony I cant say I disagree with him either.Of course you get comedy reviews like where he ate during the review of Gold Cobra by Limp Bizkit but even for artists he does not generally review well he does give them a chance if he thinks the project warrants consideration.  Example?  He just reviewed the new Rick Ross album when he gave Mastermind a comedy review.  Now Im not a Rick Ross fan either but I think it says something about Fantano that he gave it a fair listen.  And he even gave it a decent review.  Probably better than I would have if I had to review it.I think he gets a lot of backlash for seemingly only liking obscure artists at times and people see him as some sort of hipster.  Im not sure how much if at all that reputation weighs into your opinion but I just wanted to open a productive dialogue to find out more about your opinion.Cheers!,LinkinPark,dfbkxa0,2,t5_2s47y

11572077,0,t1_dg7oq3p,A friend of mine was driving me home last night. Got stuck in traffic  cars sped up slowed down  and we ended up getting rearended by another car. And we were in a small jeep too. Luckily it seems that the tire on the back of my friends car absorbed most of the general impact or it wouldve been likely that the back of the car would have been pretty damaged for how hard we were hit  the front bumper of the car that hit us was pretty badly dented.The reason I said Im glad I didnt die is because we were on a highway  a highway full of speeding cars and trucks. If the car struck us and the car suddenly swerved and we ended up in the paths of other cars we couldve been part of a pile up and maybe even dead.Luckily that wasnt the case. My friends car wasnt even damaged just a tiny piece in the back dented from Im guessing the impact.So glad that tire was there. lol,LinkinPark,dg7p8s6,8,t5_2s47y

Listen to Youthanasia by Megadeth its Heavy Metal but its not like if someone heard it theyd go oh wow this is so heavy. You have songs like A Tout le Monde that are heavy metal. Heavy metal is the least heavy of the metal genres.,LinkinPark,dgwdd75,1,t5_2s47y
