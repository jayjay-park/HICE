The gums back off showing more the teeth same with the cuticle and nails so they seem to have bigger teeth and nails. In reality their bodies are closer in apperance to a corpse than a animal but myths and legends would perpetuate the idea that wraiths turn to animals.,unitedwewrite,dbyziqw,3,t5_3fgz1
