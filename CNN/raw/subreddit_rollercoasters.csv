30329,0,t1_cehvjed,In July depending on when you go expect lines between  minutes maybe more for Cheetah Hunt. Kumba will be nearer to  minutes Montu around  Gwazi would normally be around  but since they closed one side its gotten up to  on an off day. It will probably have a pretty big line. Phoenix about  minutes or less Sand Serpent about  SheiKra about  and Cheetah Hunt probably wont dip below  for most of the day. Scorpion probably about  minutes. Skyride about  minutes at the main station and about  minutes at the back depending on how early you get there. Congo River Rapids and Stanley Falls have an insane wait in the summer. Expect  minutes for Stanley and about  for Congo. And we will have to wait and see about Falcons Fury but with it being new and not as high capacity as some other rides expect quite a wait. ,rollercoasters,cehvvbt,2,t5_2rzez

741241,0,t3_22lqzs,Honestly its not difficult to get tired of the rides at your local park. When you only visit once or twice a season theyre always thrilling but ive had season passes to cedar point the last  summers and visited around  times each season. By the end of the season I tend to skip the smaller coasters unless I have friendsfamily members with me. At one point this past season I was on Raptor which is an amazing inverted and I just kinda sat there with my hands in my lap. Didnt feel the need to scream or hold my hands up or anything just kinda sat back and enjoyed the wind in my face. It was kinda cool in some ways that I know the ride well enough but also very weird not to have that excitement in the pit of your stomach. That being said Ive still never felt bored at CP even if I dont feel the desire to ride everything. Its actually nice to not feel like you have to run to each ride and you really start to appreciate the other aspects of the park. Ive ridden a lot of the flat rides that I normally skip I take the time to ride the ferris wheel and enjoy the view of the parks skyline watched a few more shows etc. My wife and I always make it a point to make sure were on the Frontier trail after dark so we can enjoy walking through the lights. ,rollercoasters,cgoj8nh,2,t5_2rzez

868913,0,t3_2415pj,It says in the comments of the linked article this is desperation because Verbolten wasnt as big a draw as they were expecting.

896423,0,t1_ch6493g,Yep.  Im hoping that the parks next expansion gets the rights to do a flyover of this property so they can put in a BampM dive machine or something taking advantage of the natural cliff there to add to the drop.,rollercoasters,ch66eq7,2,t5_2rzez

951625,0,t1_chcf5x3,Which park will you visit or where are you close to?One thing that helped me since I had a kind of hard time with this too is to go on a big ride that doesnt have a big drop.  A good example is Silver Bullet at Knotts  it is a big ride that has lots of inversions but the hill is really mild.  Its just a large slowly descending curve.  Stand up and inverted coasters tend to have this mild first drop.If youre also afraid of inversions I would do a smaller ride with just one loop.Still in general one of the best things to do is to just go on a ride.  Dont think about it just do it.  Thats pretty much how I got over my fears.Edit  I just realize you talked about Space Mountain.  Assuming CA and not Florida or whatever a great big ride to go on is California Screamin.  Its a good size but not too big.  You get a launch lift hill and loop all in one ride.  And to add that is one of the best rides ever IMO.,rollercoasters,chcghoy,1,t5_2rzez

Were they Top  rides? Probably not. Are the new RMC versions better? Almost absolutely.  None of that is my point.My point is and Ive said it elsewhere in this thread that Six Flags is too cheap to properly maintain these rides thats the only reason why they are rough.  Instead of spending the money to make these rides better which is possible it just takes time and money they are just taking the easy way out by taking them out andor giving them the RMC treatment.

1961485,0,t1_ckp4f75,ACE skews to an older demographic but theres going to be a selfreinforcing feedback loop if younger people dont join the group for that reason.  As a  year old ACE member with reasonable social skills and other interests outside of roller coasters I would definitely encourage more people who dont fit into the stereotypical ACE demographic to join up.    Ive been in the ear of a few ACE officials over the last couple of years expressing my concerns over the future of the club and its stagnation.  I want to see younger people joining and a more diverse range of people involved.  The great thing about ACE is that it is a nonprofit organization with leadership voted on by its members.  You dont have to be afraid of getting kicked off the island because one guy in charge decides he doesnt like you.  That is also in some ways the problem with ACE and why it is a slow moving machine that can be resistant to change.  But overall I think the pros outweigh the cons.  ACE has the benefit of nearly  years of history on its side which is a lot of time spent establishing relationships with parks. Its not the flavor of the month club.    With a true club it can change if the members want it to change.  So join up and get involved!  The other nice thing is that ACE recently started a new membership category that is only  but you dont get mailed copies of ACE News or the magazine.,rollercoasters,ckpk72a,3,t5_2rzez

4006669,0,t3_36ddq7,Ok so Vekomas rides can be spectacular.  It is just more often than not the rides you find are their standard ones like the regular SLC layout and Boomerang that are much less than great.  That and many enthusiasts have been on a LOT of the more standard models.So IMHO the invertedgiant inverted boomerangs are much much better than the standard ones.  Kumali at FlamingoLand which is the only Shenlin style SLC I have been on was fantastic.  I have never heard anything negative said about the Booster Bikes as well which are an absolute blast IMHO.  Also some of their Wooden Coasters like ThunderCoaster at Tusenfryd can be awesome.So the real problem is Vekomas can be great.  They just often arent.  The worst thing IMHO is their least comfortable rides are very popular because of their compact nature.  If the trains navigated those tracks better they would be better rides.  That said I dont know how they could fix the rides out there.,rollercoasters,crczobz,2,t5_2rzez

4131803,0,t3_380952,BampM is a manufacturer recognisable since all their track looks the same like on Fury and Intimidator etc.As far as fear goes it kind of depends on what you didnt like. If you didnt like the heights then Id say build up to it a bit go for smaller ones and build up. To be perfectly honest Im still pretty scared of heights but Ive been on Top Thrill Dragster I think it just doesnt bother me since youre not really up there for very long. I would definitely go for Intimidator first or even something smaller though its a step down but its probably a good idea to do that to make sure youre going to be OK. Fury is said to be pretty intense right now and Intimidator is less so I believe but if youre certain you want to just go straight for it feel free to try.If it was the roughness of the woody that you didnt like then well go for steels. BampMs are extremely smooth generally so look out for that style of track thats on Fury etc. if you want a smooth ride. If you didnt really like feeling out of control well good luck but coasters may not be for you lol.Ive never thrown up after a ride or coaster so Im probably not best to answer that but I generally just barely eat anything on days at theme parks. A quick snack for lunch and dont go on anything thats really going to throw you around straight after and with a strong stomach youll likely be fine.Other advice I can think of position on train can make a pretty big difference. Middle of the train can be significantly less intense than either end though I think youre allocated a row on Fury anyway. Choose according to the experience you want. Working back to front in a park is generally the best way to dodge crowds possibly starting at a bigticket attraction since that queue will build up for the whole day anyway. Most important thing though is to make sure you enjoy yourself. Theres no point doing something new and scary if youre not going to have a good time doing it. Hopefully you will but keep it in mind.Have a great time!,rollercoasters,crr8znx,2,t5_2rzez

We can speculate all day about Smiler but theyre never going to directly come out and say We had a problem X with system Y or whatever.

4402351,0,t1_csjdlz5,The raw speed was insane compared to everything else out there at the time. There was airtime in the back of the train for the first drop and massive airtime on the second hill in EVERY seat. The two large terrain hills in the back had some airtime too the first few years. The Helix was insane before they reprofiled it. In this video it wasnt running as fast as it was when it was running the first few years. The kicker tires were needed in the shed only when they braked it to near  a stop but they learned running only  trains meant they didnt have to slow trains down as much in the shed. Its too bad they neutered it so badly. There are massive trim brakes on both the st and nd hills brakes going down to the helix really uncomfortable restrictive seats. Now its more of a fast bumpy ride through the woods. ...My most magical memory happened a few years after this video. Along with adding the wooden tunnels they had learned that occasionally they needed to stop the ride and evacuate passengers on the nd lift hill. They built two walkways about a rd and  of the ways up the lift hill to accommodate this along with a spot that a ride attendant could stand and give warnings before hitting the helix. A friend and I waited our usual  hours to ride and as we started out of the station it started raining. The trim brakes in the shed did absolutely nothing and we had massive airtime along with welts on our faces speeding along the back terrain hills. What I remember most though was the fact that our car we were in the nd row screw waiting an extra  minutes did not catch on the second lift chain until we were past the nd walkway. It was INSANE. I had ridden the beast at least  times by this time and this had never happened. The only explanation I could ever think for it years later when we talked about it was that the first  minutes of a rainstorm the skid plate brakes would be to greasy to actually slow down the train much. Thats why they would immediately pull off a train in those days because they didnt want to run the risk of having an issue with loading and having  trains on the final brake run. When they ran  it was very common if there was an issue loading. ,rollercoasters,cslvoi8,2,t5_2rzez

4736493,0,t3_3fshsf,Mavericks old restraints were painful.  Now imagine how bad those restraints were on Millenniums and Mavericks drunken lovechild I when it first opened.  Those restraints lasted a couple months before they switched them to the current vest restraints.I rode Maverick two weeks ago with the new restraints and it made the ride so much better.  I dont know if cost was a factor why CP hadnt switched them before now but it was a welcome change.,rollercoasters,ctrktn5,6,t5_2rzez
4772628,0,t3_3g95yf,Well this is a cool surprise if not a slightly anticlimactic one. I wouldnt be shocked if this were real. This is hardly the first time a coaster has been leaked before the announcement. I went over to the Pointbuzz forums and a few people are claiming to have seen the entire layout. According to someone who says he saw the whole video the coaster will feature two vertical drops an immelman a dive loop a barrel roll and an air time hill. Take that with the required grain of salt...Personally Ive gotten used to the idea of a big ol dive machine at Cedar Point. Assuming the colors are accurate Im not a big fan of the orangey color but I do like the supports. Ultimately colors arent the reason why I ride a coaster.Im hoping for ft and a dive into either a tunnel or some other themed area. Id like to see them do more theming than usual and flesh out the story of the Valravn but just like Rougarou I doubt that will happen. I like these mythical coaster names but when the park hardly bothers to explain what a Rougarou or a Valravn is its a big waste of potential.,rollercoasters,ctw4s4c,9,t5_2rzez

4821020,0,t3_3gwmo1,It really depends on the storm system. Its not uncommon to have brief popup thunderstorms that go on and off throughout the day. Being at the park before a storm can suck because the wind will usually shut down Top Thrill Windseeker and possibly Raptor and Gatekeeper. However if the winds arent terrible almost all the rides will run in a light rain. Rainy days can be great days at the parks because a lot of people choose not to travel to the park for those days. Had a thunderstorm blow through a couple years ago when I was camping near CP and we ended up spending the morning driving around doing other things. Decided to show up to the park around  and spend half a day there. The rain had stopped and we rode everything with little to no wait.,rollercoasters,cu289ew,3,t5_2rzez

4986286,0,t1_cumkijl,I think the minimum threshold to really attract coaster enthusiasts is three solid coasters in a park.  This will bring Seaworlds stable up to three solid BampM coasters plus the Mack water coaster and the kiddie coaster.  Seaworld will have the only flying coaster Manta and only hyper Mako in Florida plus the excellent criminally underrated floorless looper Kracken.  So I think for coaster enthusiasts heading to Orlando Seaworld should be on the top of the list of stops along with IOA.  I dont think anyone was expecting a Furylevel thrill coaster in Orlando.

5175210,0,t1_cv9ez39,OP from that thread. Kennywood is my home park. I know the Phantom as well as anybody and have clocked nearly  rides just this summer. I firmly believe the ride is running far faster. Without actually getting photo or video evidence or the exact stats on the ride and a physics expert there isnt a way for me to prove it. However in the previous thread my estimates have the total drop from the top of the first hill to the bottom of the second at over  ft. Potentially the increase in sustained momentum from heavier trains could allow the train to reach much higher speeds than anticipated. Certainly feels like it.,rollercoasters,cv9sx0s,2,t5_2rzez

The tricky part is that this app would need a comprehensive list of parks and their coasters to be useful. If only we could get hold of the RCDB database could try scraping it of course but with so many coasters thats a lot of requests. The alternative is to have users themselves add missing coasters  though youd need quite a few users to get a reasonably complete list.There do exist websites that already do this sort of thing though.

6602154,0,t1_d026arc,I was referring to Gatekeeper specifically. I havent ridden Banshee enough to comment on that. I think I misunderstood though and did notice the back of GK being pretty shaky and rough. I always chalked that up to the standard rear train ride. I rode MF in the very back once and got off never wanting to ride again. Same with Magnum and many other rides like Raptor Diamondback Flight of Fear amp Tatsu. Arrow I think has the worst showing in the back. If I have a choice I avoid the back of any coaster. I quit riding Mantis until late in its life when the front seat was a walk on and only then did I find it acceptable but we all enjoy different things. I find as I get older smooth rides like Gatekeeper Wild Eagle and Gemini appeal to me more than rides like Maverick Fahrenheit Banshee and I.

Olympus A kiddie wooden coaster with a rather unique spreadout layout. However just like mostall of their coasters its rough as hell. Heck this might have been the roughest of the  and its only  ft tall!. Toboggan at Lakemont Park rd worst steel coaster according to Mitchs poll. Has Chances signature cage cars that resemble a solitary confinement cell. The vertical lift is cool but the spiraling helix ends with a brutal dip that levels out abruptly and threatens to smash your head against the unpadded car.. Corkscrew at Michigans Adventure Another classic clone from the s but its pretty pointless these days. Picture Corkscrew at CP without the loop or airtime hill.

Perhaps it depends on how far the GP is willing to drive to the park. Good question.I was thinking about this and would you describe Waldameer as a small park or a regional park?

The fact that its over  years old and still holds up as being undeniably one of the best coasters in the world says that this is a classic.. Boulder Dash  So close to being number . I am still amazed at how great a ride can be without going very high off the ground. The whole... cutting down as few trees as possible and LC keeping up with maintenance. I love it!. Olympia Looping  The first non terrain coaster on my list. I never thought Id ride it but I have a thing for high gforces and you cant ask for a better ride for forces.. Phoenix  airtime and buzzbars. Not sure I need to explain any more..... Steel Dragon    I have a strange situation. I dont think most people get this.... but whatever it is. I had the perfect floater airtime on EVERY hill. Its just something to behold. Millennium Force is pretty amazing to stand next to but this ride with all the extra steel to withstand earthquakes is just something else.. Voyage  Yeah... Im kind of going back and forth wood Vs. Steel but whatever. I dont know how they do it but this ride never feels like it loses speed. Of course it loses tons of speed but the pacing is just perfect. I love that its got the wooden rumble and not your Intamin plug and play wood that everyone loves.. Goliath at La Ronde  Same at Steel Dragon... Perfect airtime on every hill. Just very fun.. Outlaw Run  This actually probably should be higher... but whatever. The wooden invertingness. Dont care what you say its just fun. Cant get off this ride without smiling.this is actually the end of the OMG this ride is so amazing. The last  are kind of filler.... this ride is really fun but theres nothing super fantastic about it. Katun  BampM invert of complete fun. Whats special about it? Nothing. It was just a really good layout.. Millennium Force  It really doesnt deserve this spot. The ride got rougher and not as fun. But its here because.... look at it. Just look at it. I love the lights on it at night. I love the cool supports for the lift hill.

But also part of it not having air time or loops or any of that good stuff leads it to... actually it was all about space either way it leads to that side to side from burm to burm which is just so much fun. The other totally awesome thing about this roller coaster is its location Australia.

8749865,0,t3_4zvxp9,Mad House design same as Hex at Alton Towers The Haunting at Drayton Manor and theres a very old traditional one at Blackpool Pleasure Beach all UK btw. The mechanics work that the entire room spins around and the audience sit on a rocking platform. It creates the illusion that the platform is turning over  but actually it just creates the feeling of tipping and pairs it with the visuals of turning over. Very very clever ride and one of my all time favourites.Ps Hex at Alton Towers is currently closed for refurbishment and due to a braking issue with the rotating drum.,rollercoasters,d6ze0cu,2,t5_2rzez

8862604,0,t1_d7d56ge,Well Ive hated it before I even knew it was a Velkoma but in terms of the roughness youre right in that its not insanely rough but IMO even if a GCI woddie is overall a bit rougher the layouts dont really have enough forceful elements to really make it a problem.When you can backwards through the dark on that little helix near the end the ride is actually pretty forceful and that rattle can really knock your head back into the seat. I also just hate the layout of the ride and backwards rides in general. I dont understand the appeal of going backwards ever.Basically if they built the mountain and then made traditional GCI woodie going through it I would have loved it but they try and use the mountain exclusively so it really cramps the elements and you never really get a decent drop or anything like that.,rollercoasters,d7d5s6d,1,t5_2rzez

8925154,0,t1_d7knkbh,Its easy to argue that but different manufacturers have different standards in terms of their designs. Sure Mack and BampM do similar things but youll never see BampM willingly have just a lapbar as a part of a looping coasters design without some other form of restraint to go along with it. Every manufacturer designs their rides differently and considering what Mack and BampM have installed its easy to see why a simple lapbar is not feasible for BampM and why theyll never do it unless they completely redesign their trains from the ground up.BampM doesnt design their trains with any sort of side rest above the hips due to space constraints with the trains. It can be clearly seen with Hypercoaster installations along with most of their traditional OTSRs where riders are basically shoulder to shoulder. If they wanted to go to a traditional lapbar they would need something to replace that which wouldnt be feasible considering how tight the space is on the cars and making sure it doesnt prevent too many people from riding. BampM has built trains similar to Macks but they very obviously like to stick to their preferred way of building things. Seating people as tightly as possible and ensuring the least amount of movement with the riders body as possible.Mack at least designs their seats in order to prevent lateral movement of a persons upper body and build them with enough space in mind in order to do so. But you can see a clear intent to keep things at most  riders wide in order to do so. They have built  across seating but you can clearly see how much effort has gone into ensuring  riders still remain above the tracks and that their seat configuration remains unaltered by doing so.,rollercoasters,d7ko86z,3,t5_2rzez

While I love this coaster I agree that it wasnt a great move for the park but they are so limited on space at knotts that its ridiculous. They did what they could. Sure the pond area looked nice but SB is now one of the  main attractions at knotts and without it there would be something seriously lacking in their lineup. It stands with Montes as  of the  inverting coasters at knotts and Montes is pretty much a family coaster. Although Id say this is probably one of the best family orientated inverts with inversions out there. It could have been worse...

I personally wish there was some better way to make people put their phones away or not bring them on a ride unless secure. I never see anyone actually removed from the park for taking them out even when the ride OP has to stop the ride from advancing out of the queue or on the lift hill. People always think they can hold on to them and never can. Taking crappy selfmade POV snapchatting selfies live broadcasting  all of it encourages bringing a phone out on rides  but there are few solutions to prevent them making a circuit other than metal detectors.  Granted I am a bit of a hypocrite as I take credit card ID phone and car key if rental in to park and then everything goes in a zippered pocket.

11652773,0,t1_dggtx06,That seems like an incredibly clunky way of performing a recovery but I guess theres not a whole lot that can be done. I would imagine thatd take hours given the time it takes to get a crane set up. Interesting. Thanks,rollercoasters,dgguu2s,1,t5_2rzez

11661744,0,t1_dghpqh3,According to Wikipedia theres bern at least four deaths mainly due to the doors coming open.  Though that appears to have fixed with better door locks and the few with OTSRs dont have the problem at due to the way the restraont is secured not by locking the door.,rollercoasters,dghvghq,2,t5_2rzez

11747852,0,t1_dgrlcm6,Do it.  BGW used to be my home park even the older rides are great and all of them have pretty good terrain usage.  Alpengeist sparked my love for inverted coasters its so smooth and so well made.  Also Loch Ness Monster will ALWAYS be a legend in my book love that clunky old thing.,rollercoasters,dgrncpw,2,t5_2rzez

11788727,0,t3_685zaj,I rode it earlier this year I live  min away and while I wouldnt call it a destination coaster I did get  rides on it with the wristband and I really enjoyed it. I got to try it in a lot of different rows and the experience changes drastically based on where you sit. Only sit in the front row of each car and you should be fine in terms of roughness in the last row it just throws you around. Theres some okay airtime I distinctly remember one hill being particularly strong in the front row because of the buzzbars and overall I found it to be pretty intense and unpredictable.,rollercoasters,dgwaie2,1,t5_2rzez
