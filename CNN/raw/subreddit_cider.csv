2068525,0,t3_2ijo9h,That missing mouth feel is from the lack of tannins. From your description your juice was most likely a blend of dessert apples which lack the tartness and tannin of cider apples. To compensate buy some wine tannin and blend it into your cider. If you want a bit more bite add a small amount of malic acid. With only a gallon of cider add both the tannin and malic in very small amounts. The art of good cider making is in the blending.,cider,cl2r6so,2,t5_2rko1

Unscrew the cap. Introduce yeast. Place cap on but do not screw. If you screw the cap on pressure will build in the jug and make problems. Then just watch what it does. Most of the excitement occurs in the first week maybe two. After two weeks you should have fermented cider and it will taste pretty raw. But if you arent too discerning you wont care.Total cost maybe .I can give you some more details on how I started since Im just a beginner if youd like to know.Dont feel bad for asking questions.

2751057,0,t3_2rhipi,I cant believe nobody has brought up specific gravity. To know how much alcohol is in the cider you check the amount of sugar before starting fermentation not brewing. You check with a hydrometer. When you have finished fermentation you take another SG reading. Then you use a calculation to determine the alcohol by volume percentage.There are online tools that make it simple.  If you bottle before the sugar has all been converted then you dont have to add sugar to carbonate. If theres too much left or if you add too much though you will create a bottle bomb if you dont pasteurize at the right time. If you over carbnonate and try to pastueize the bottle would blow too. I have pasteurized several times with just a couple bottles popping...and I was prepared. I partially covered the pot. But I have also bottled several whose SG reading was in the . to . range and they carbed nicely without over carbing. Also you will find some yeasts strip more flavorsweetness than others. Champagne yeast practically takes it all. British ale yeasts usually leave things sweeter.,cider,cngs88e,1,t5_2rko1

Its hard to find cider apples here in urban Australia it seems.... weve got Granny Smiths Fuji Pink Lady Royal Gala and Red Delicious in the stores at the moment... so Ill just ward the crowd off those last two and encourage the first I guess and any other random varieties like Crab Apples or something.With the mead Ive done I dont think Ive pitched below ..

In the future just try and focus on sanitizing everything that touches your cider. If you dont plan on carbonating the cider but do plan on aging it for a while before bottling then I would suggest adding potassium metabisulfate after completion of the primary fermentation to protect the cider from any other bugs.

It would be handy for everyone making cider this way.If its pretty low in acidity lt  gl I would use Cote des Blanc as it addsretains very noticeable fruit tropical aromas and flavors. It doesnt metabolize malic acid and it greatly inhibits MLF  so you need to make sure the acidity is low to start or it will be too tart.Cote des Blancs is also very easy to stick. You just need to rack it twice  ideally dropping to very low temps a few days before each rack. Pitch only .g per gallon. No yeast nutrient.I racked a batch . this year at . F and again at . F. It looks like its going to stick around .. Plenty of sweetness left. I wouldnt start at too high of gravity or else its going to be impossible to smooth it out. I doubt youll be able to stop a fermentation via racking much before .. If you started around . that would give you about  ABV. In my opinion anything above that isnt going to taste very good  especially with boringwatery store bought juice.If you want something higher I think you would have to make an Ice Cider.

9093506,0,t3_54sgv7,Nice discussion!  One website that I think will be even more awesome once it takes off is CiderExpert.com for cider ratings.  It includes an overall score review and scaled ratings for sweetdry acidity tartness astringency body carbonation aroma sourness bitterness etc.  When crowd sourced with enough entries I think data like this can be pretty accurate even more so than a ciderys own description.If I had to choose only two descriptors for a cider Id say sweetdry then flavor intensity.  Ive found flavor intensity to have a big influence on whether I like a cider...I like something more in your face whether its the tannins of an English cider appleforward flavor of an English cider or added fruithopsspicesetc.review with photos of the  Mugs of Cider book including their flavor wheel  see here for a larger image common guide to cider tasting  cider judging guidelines with info on various taste properties  and their score sheet  ,cider,d84w6ba,2,t5_2rko1

9508828,0,t1_d9l5o1k,Yeah it dipped a little colder last night than it has but not really much outside the effective range of the yeast that kind of crashing would make it more cloudy?

10530334,0,t3_5qqhp2,oz isnt crazy for one gallon. Check a priming calculator online oz is about right for . vol CO.As others saiy two weeks is pretty fast for cider. It may not even be done fermenting completely yet which could give you some problems in bottle. I would wait min  month.Bottle conditioning can be as fast as a few weeks but mine usually takes  months. Cider ages well in bottle so even if you dont age very long in the carboy it will get MUCH better with time in the bottle. I now expect  months for my cider that has already aged  months...  months is even better...  time is your friend!,cider,dd1q8hf,3,t5_2rko1

10740000,0,t3_5tmk44,Generally speaking the later you add your flavoring agent the more flavor youll retain. The tradeoff is that bacterial contamination is more likely the later you add it as well. Theres no right answer to this question but I generally recommend adding postfermentation and taking some measures to limit the possibility of contamination soaking the leaves in a small amount of vodka before dumping it all into your batch postfermentation or adding sulfite in conjunction with the addition for example,cider,ddnr0bk,1,t5_2rko1

I think people are usually referring to a soda or water type bottle with less structure than the Gatorade bottle. It will help you feel the internal pressure better. My solution to all this?
