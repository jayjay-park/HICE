At this point I have a much better idea of what I like and think looks good on me better than I could describe to a real stylist.The important thing for males to remember is to blend. Early on I did as a few other redditors have described using a single  inch on the sides and a longer guard on the top. After I got better at styling though I found a ths on the side followed by a  and ths trim bringing the hairline gradually up towards the looks much better than the single guard method.After that I stopped using the guard for large portions of the cutting and use the same fingermeasuring methods stylists use to keep the hair even.

78817,0,t1_ceneh2u,Heres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Trans fat  gtgtTrans fats are a type of unsaturated fat which is uncommon in nature but can be created artificially.gtHydrocarbons are carbon atoms with hydrogen atoms attached to them. Fats fatty acids contain long hydrocarbon chains. The carbon atoms in the chain can be connected by single bonds or double bonds. A double carboncarbon bond can be either across trans or bent cis. In the vegetable and animal kingdoms fatty acids generally have cis as opposed to trans unsaturations. In food production liquid cisunsaturated fats such as vegetable oils are catalytically hydrogenated to produce partially or completely saturated fats that melt at a desirable temperature  C. Trans fats are an artificial contaminant introduced by an isomerization side reaction on the catalyst in partial hydrogenation.gtUnsaturated fat is a fat molecule containing double bonds between the carbon atoms. Since the carbons are doublebonded to each other there are fewer bonds connected to hydrogen so there are fewer hydrogen atoms hence unsaturated. Cis and trans are terms that refer to the arrangement of the two substituent groups across the double bond. In the cis arrangement the groups are on the same side of the double bond. In the trans arrangement the groups are on opposite sides of the double bond. A double bond is not rotatable in ordinary conditions but a catalyst such as a nickel surface can break the double bond and allow the remaining single bond to rotate.gtAlthough trans fats are edible consumption of trans fats increases the risk of coronary heart disease by raising levels of the lipoprotein LDL socalled bad cholesterol and lowering levels of the lipoprotein HDL good cholesterol. Trans fats also occur naturally in a limited number of cases vaccenyl and conjugated linoleyl CLA containing trans fats occur naturally in trace amounts in meat and dairy products from ruminants. Natural and manmade trans fats are chemically different but there is no scientific consensus about differences in their health effects. Two Canadian studies have shown that the natural trans fat vaccenic acid found in beef and dairy products could actually be beneficial compared to hydrogenated vegetable shortening or a mixture of pork lard and soy fat by lowering total and LDL and triglyceride levels. In contrast a study by the US Department of Agriculture showed that vaccenic acid has the same detrimental effects on LDL and HDL as industrial trans fats. In lack of recognized evidence and scientific agreement nutritional authorities consider all trans fats as equally harmful for health and recommend that consumption of trans fats be reduced to trace amounts.gtThe FDA has issued a preliminary determination that partially hydrogenated oils which contain trans fats are not generally recognized as safe which is expected to lead to a ban on industrially produced trans fats from the American diet. In other countries there are legal limits to trans fat content. Trans fats levels can be reduced or eliminated alternatives are using saturated fats such as lard palm oil or completely hydrogenated fats interesterified fat and alternative formulations that allow unsaturated fats to be used to replace saturated or partially hydrogenated fats. Hydrogenated oil is not a synonym for trans fat complete hydrogenation removes all unsaturated both cis and trans fats.Pictureimage source | about | uheapsofsheeps can reply with delete.

I know you said you have hardly any income coming in but do include things such as gas money babysitting gifts etc. Next take notice to any indulgences after tracking your spending its surprising how much we can mindlessly spend. Cut this out! Thirdly use coupons and plan your weekly meals in relation to weekly sales at the grocery store. Just dont be fooled not everything on sale is a good deal buy only what you need. On this same note build up food necessities. This is things such as rice dried beans eggs veggies and fruit frozen and fresh. I try my best to not buy anything I could possibly make so things such as muffins good breakysnacks soups cookies for a treat etc. As well I have made a rule for myself absolutely no eating out unless its for a super special occasion anniversary close family members birthday. This saved me a bunch when I moved out. On the same note of spending money and food I realized after tracking my expenses that I was spending a lot on teas and coffee during school hours  days a week got pretty intense so I now bring a travel mug every time I go to school and keep a baggy full of different teas in my purse. Fourthly to keep up with a social life if your friends like to eat out a lot go for coffee go to the bar etc. suggest having nights in or even themed nights. Once a month I grt together with a large group of my girlfriends we rotate between houses have a themed night spa night a certain movie like clueless night etc. and have a pot luck. Its awesome because I get to see my friends when I otherwise might not be able to. Lastly check out rslowcooking for some great crockpot meals.

It adds more flavor and additional ingredients that helps to fill out the recipe. Also I tend to use less versus standard tomato based salsa because of the additional flavor.However if Im just looking to add a bit of tomato taste to a recipe I tend to just find the cheapest salsa. It is also more versatile so it may be easier to use for a variety of recipes. I think I remember making an omelette with the black bean salsa and it didnt taste very good...so while it tastes amazing in burritos and quesadillas not so much with egg based foods. Steer clear of Taco Bell salsas or queso dips. Ive found that they dont taste very good. Also check expiration dates before you purchase  if you dont eat salsa very often then you might want to pick up the brand that has the longest shelf life.Ive never made it myself and unless you eat a ton of it I cant imagine you could save much money making it from scratch. Im sure it tastes a lot better but not if I make it! haha. Also sometimes when I know a friend is going to Moes or another TexMex restaurant then Ill ask them to pick me up one of those free sides. I also have a friend that works at a local TexMex taco joint and at the end of the day the employees get to take home anything that cant make it through the night so salsa gauc etc...

For items like burgers or pork chops fold the wax paper in half down the middle and stack up a lot of chops with the wax paper zigzag between it and once around the outside of all. Place stack in heavy plastic bag and squish out all the air.  You will be able to separate the number of servings you need due to the two layers of wax paper.  You cant defrost in the microwave with the wax paper though defrost inside a plastic bag in a bowl of warm water in the sink for about  min. or in a lidded pyrex dish in the fridge for a couple hours or the next day.Meats cooked I dont tend to freeze cooked meat but would wrap in a wax paper then foil like above for something like meatloaf a big chunk of ham.

251498,0,t3_1wzmbv,My boyfriend switched over to Straight Talk since October.  He loves it.  He sent friends and family an email of his experience after a few months.  He also ported his number to Google.  So the following copypasta goes into detail mainly in how they work together.Heres the important stuff. TLDR  see the summary at the bottom.Native Straight TalkThe initial concerns about Straight Talk SIM cards not supporting MMS picture messaging have been fixed as recently as a week ago. If you port your phone number to Straight Talk to use their service exclusively you will pay month and your phone will work exactly the same as far as calling and texting  both coming and going. The only cap is if you use more than GBmonth in cellular data.Google Voice  Voice MailBefore my ATampT contract expired I had already decided to try out Google Voice for voice mail  only. So when someone called me and I didnt answer it went to my GV inbox instead of ATampTs. I found there are nothing but benefits from using GV voice mail and it is free to enable and start using right away. You get voicetotext translation you can have custom greetings for individuals or groups of people or even timeofday you can be notified of new voice messages by text message voice messages are saved forever and searchable just like gmail and you can install a Google Chrome extension to manage all of it and be notified just like a gmail extension. The ONLY difference to doing things on your phone is that you wont use the builtin iPhone voice mail viewer any more. You will want to install the Google Voice app to check voice mail. More than worth getting used to in my opinion.Whether you stay with ATampT or port your number to Straight Talk GV voice mail works the exact same in both scenarios and there is no cost or changeover required.Google Voice  Number PortFirst off if you port your number to Google Voice you will need to obtain a new SIM card with a new phone number whether from ATampT or Straight Talk or whoever. When you port your number it gets removed from your existing SIM card so that you can control the number through Google Voices service. Its essentially floating in the cloud  so you will need a new forwarding number bound to your phone to point it to.If you decide to port your number to Google Voice and get a Straight Talk SIM like me you get some added features some options for how you handle outgoing callstexts and one or two cons  if you want to consider it that. Here is the list of pros and cons I have after testing.Phone Calls PRO People can call your preexisting number and it works the exact same as before. If you couple inbound calls with Google voice mail you have more control over screening calls and privacy. PRO You can control your outgoing caller ID. When you use the GV iPhone app to make calls your original preexisting caller ID is shown on the receiving end. The way this works is that it sets up the call by calling a Google proxy number an Atlanta or California number for example that is unique to the person you are calling. When outgoing calls go through that proxy it will always display your GV  original number. There are two ways to handle outgoing calls.Use the GV app to create a new favorites list or use the builtin contacts list to place calls.Use the iPhone dialer app to place calls the same as before. If you call someone directly your new SIM number will show up on the receiving end. If you call their proxy number your GV number will show up. I figured out what everyones unique proxy number was and added it as a nd number for them in my contacts. This way I can choose which caller ID I show by the number I call for that contact. Most of the time I will want my original caller ID to show but for those who dont know about my new number this allows me to be sneaky. PRO You can initiate calls by clicking any phone number in your browser. GV will call your cell phone and then connect the other end of the call. This is AWESOME. PRO If you ever have the need you can block numbers easily. PRO You can put your phone number in Do Not Disturb mode for a specified period of time or on a schedule. PRO Hangouts is tied to your GV account now so you can answer incoming calls on either your computer or phone. CON well sort of Hangouts will ALWAYS ring when you get a phone call. There is currently no way to turn this off. PRO Google is trying to make Hangouts and Google Voice a merged product. Although it isnt ready yet it should add even more benefits when finished.Texting PRO SMS texting works exactly the same as the first two points above. You can control your outgoing caller ID based on texting to your contacts original number or their unique proxy. Using the GV app will always show your original number or you can use the iMessage app to pick and choose. PRO You can send SMS texts from your Browser and reply to existing texts. I love this and am already using it as often as I text from my phone. CON No way around this  MMS texting does not work with Google Voice. You can still send and receive MMS texts on your phone but you will need to use your new SIM number. Your contacts will need to send picture texts to your new SIM number or you will not receive it so you may need to tell people to use your secondary number but only for MMS texting. Similarly when you use the iMessage app to send pictures it will use your new SIM number as the caller ID to the receiver. I tried all the tricks including forwarding MMS messages to email sending a picture to my contacts proxy number and sending very lowres pictures  it does not work when you try to use your GV number with MMS. Small PRO They fixed this for GV users on the Tmobile network last week and are working on supporting it for all carriers. This may be available in the near future.SummaryPorting your number directly to Straight Talk cuts your phone bill in half and you lose no features. Everything will work exactly the same but you may need to update the iOS on your phone in order to receive the recent network fixes that were rolled out over the past two weeks.Google voice mail is great whether you change carriers or not. Highly recommend.Porting your number to Google Voice gives you big benefits for phone calls and SMS text but makes MMS a little tedious. You dont lose the ability to use MMS on your phone but your contacts will need to use a new number whenever they want to text you a picture. This may be fixed in the near future.Id rather just have one app on my phone to place calls and text cant use GV app for MMS for example but I have the option of using both which gives me control. That outweighs app consolidation.Im happy with my decision to port my number to Google Voice. They are always improving the service and I have way more visibility and control. If you dont want to use GV you should at least consider Straight Talk. Your phone would work exactly the same and youd pay month.I hope this sheds some light what to expect if you choose to change your phone service.

Its just one dollar per heart or you can buy a five dollar gold one.Doesnt... diabetes... like large sodas you just sold me... candy... grain foods like popcorn...?No? Okay your total is .. Heres your receipt. Enjoy your show!The fun part is where all that upselling for concessions that are refillable and free candy for a measly cents is of utmost importance for Regals margins despite the fact that playing that whole script at full fucking speed was still so slow that it caused a couplethree people per script to just leave the concession stand because they didnt want to miss their movie. My job there ended when I said as much to a district manager and when he argued that the margin was in the receipts I pointed out that zerosum sales of people deciding to go without dont result in receipts. I STILL live under the philosophy that selling more small popcorns provides better margins than large ones theyre calculating on the assumption that everyone in the concession stand is going to stay there and were wrangling extra cents out of each purchase when in fact theyre losing customers because of the cents wrangling. Its penny rich and pound poor policy all up in their corporate office.Unless things have changed in the last holy god that was like  years ago!Now when I go to the theatre and the guy is upselling I tell them Im buying the popcorn for the margins in the first place Im merely selecting on the size I can actually consume.,Frugal,cfawdvk,9,t5_2qhbe

With DTV if signal is not strong enough to overcome noise youre still not going to get a picture amplifying both. With DTV picture is either there and beautiful or not there at all. No such thing as snow.Also Id add that you should make sure the antenna you buy is able to receive VHF as well as UHF. Too many DTV antennas are UHF only.,Frugal,cff9mmn,5,t5_2qhbe

My only point was if you hire a serviceman to fix something for you you have to pay for the work. If you dont like it tough.  we only mark up  which is actually  less then standard markup in my area.  so if he changed the drain hose first and it didnt fix the problem would you be complaining about the  part and the time he put in to replace it? Probably.  you mean occams razor? No Ive never heard of it.   Again we dont have enough details to know if the tech went about it wrong. The circuit board could have been bad too.

Buy a couple boxes of Ziploc bags and label every single nut amp bolt.  Study  Seriously dont be macho and figure it out.  Read through the Haynes manual first and understand what youre about to do.  Even if its just an oil change... just take a few minutes and read the page or two.Pride  Ask for help.  Get on the forums.  In this case a Miata is perfect  the community around that car is amazing.  Project Management  Study the overview and details of what youre about to do.  Break it down into multiple smaller projects.  Break those down into steps.  Write it down and follow them in order.  Dont jump around from one thing to another.Walk Away  If you get pissed off just walk away.  Dont smash your bumper with a sledgehammer because a bolt is stripped.  Walk away grab a beer bitch about it on the forums and come back to it the next day with a real solution.  Sounds stupid but even a Zen master is going to start cursing and throw a wrench at some point on a project car...The actual turning of wrenches is the easy part which can be quite relaxing once you start getting the hang of it and really understand what youre doing.None of my rambling is really directed at you uhuffalump  just throwing it out there in case anyone else has been considering working on their own car.  ,Frugal,cftak65,3,t5_2qhbe

485961,0,t3_1zgvqs,Its legit. People are skeptical because they havent tried it out or won an item on there. My buddy bid  times on a gig iPod touch and won. Arrived days later brand new in the box! Heres the deal with these sites. They are legit but they make assloads of money. You see that  MacBook sell for ?. The site just profited  and heres how. You buy bids from them. Generally around  per bid ticket. Can buy bulk bid packs for cheaper. When you bid on an item the price moves up a penny and a ticket is subtracted from your bid pile. So for an item to sell for  there needs to be  . bids. Thats  tickets sold for about  a piece. In my buddys case he bid  times out of  bids he purchased. The auction total ended being close to . Add  on there one for each bid and he got a brand new gig iPod touch for  shipped to his front door. Yes the company made  off selling one iPod but my buddy only paid  for it. The odds of you winning an auction? Depends on who wants that item. People pump tens of thousands of dollars into those sites bid till they win and resell the products slightly under retail all day long and make a living. As for the company pumping their own bids highly illegal and if caught with proof theyd be in the middle of a lawsuit having to pay back millions of dollars in bids to the sites users. Really not worth the risk for them in any way shape or form since theyre already making millions running the site. And they can afford to sell items for  cents too so when  items end low like that it benefits them more than they lose. The sites users see the  cent  dollar item they say to themselves if I buy  in bids bid it all on a  item I gotta win and I saved  by doing it. You can come out on top but you need the right investment capital and time. ,Frugal,cfvi9vw,0,t5_2qhbe

You will probably have to travel a bit to a cheaper store Pathmark Costco Target etc. If you are somewhere in NY state look up if there are any grocery outlet type stores around you or hopefully you are near a Wegmans.

558800,0,t3_20is0e,I would buy private over a dealer firstly. I would probably also go for a Honda over Pontiac. But honestly for k you should be able to find something better if youre willing to put in some time to find a good deal. I had a Pontiac Aztek and didnt have any major problems until I started creeping up to k miles. If a Honda is well taken care of it will last for a long time. I prefer cars with only one previous owner and a solid carfax and i am obsessed with car reviews when shopping around. Edmunds and Kelly blue book are great resources and you can use apps like Autotrader to find and compare cars from dealers and private sellers and they also list specs if Im not mistaken. Have you considered a bank loan? I used loans on my last two and with older cars and good standing with your bank you might have a car payment less than  a month. That could give you a little more flexibility on the price I totaled a car and needed like  more than my settlement to get my Aztek and  more for my truck. Dont forget to take insurance gas and maintenance into account when shopping for a car. I spend over  a month to keep myself mobile in a  year old truck paid  for her and that is without repairs and maintenance taken into account. Older cars are certainly cheaper on paper off paper it varies wildly. Transmission issues? Forget about it. Overheating issues? Maybe expensive maybe some duct tape on a hose and a couple of gallons of water in your trunk for emergencies. In my current vehicle most everything is sound but its is a bare bones base model truck and its a manual transmission. Bought her in a pinch and lucked out. She was certainly loved by her previous owner. I would definitely recommend buying the manual for whatever car you do decide on theyre like  and helpful with troubleshooting and basic repairs. And dont forget to test drive. Let it idle get it up to speed let it idle some more run the ac on full blast while it idles watch the gauges like a hawk keep your ears open. Anything sounding particularly rough or clunky and you probably want to avoid it. Check the condition of the belts tires oil power steering battery connections. If that stuff is ugly someone wasnt maintaining their vehicle before they got rid of it and there maybe bigger issues. Private sellers are usually less pressure in my experience when it comes to really checking out what your potential sweet ride has going on under the hood. I also try I avoid used cars that were owned or being sold in coastal areas saltwater is not good for a car. Especially an older car that already has brittle rubber and plastic components. And remember Google is your friend. Good luck!,Frugal,cg3sjax,2,t5_2qhbe

628260,0,t1_cgbnk5q,That is quite the philosophical question. In fact being ripped off implies that gt ObjectValue lt ObjectCostFor simplicitys sake lets assume that the cost for any given object is constant of course its not because richer people incur less disutility cost because an objects cost is a much smaller proportion of their income.Therefore the key here is defining the objects value. What is the objects value? If I gave a homeless person a camera that costs  hed value that at whatever the resale value of that camera is. If I gave a teenager who aspires to be a photographer with that camera he might value it at much more than . In fact its the nature of human beings to value objects differently some think of only the cost of resale some only think of the cost of substitutes some hold on to it and squeeze as much personal utility from it as possible. In some industries like airlines pricing theory determines what the dynamic price of a good is. The volatility of the price is changed to capture the differences in willingness to pay of different customer segments.So how do we define if uangelworks was ripped off or not? We cant because we can not accurately assess the value that an object gives to him since we are not uangelworks. Perhaps uangelworks might be able to get a better deal from an alternate vendor or a substitute but then we can only say that he got a better deal not that he got ripped off.Therefore it is fruitless for us to judge one another on our transactions because it is impossible to gauge each others definitions of value. We can only say thisIn my frame of reference I know that that object priced at X dollars is a bad deal for me.

Any advice about anything? thanks!!The only advice I could offer is that life is short. If youre going to do something crazy do it while youre young. You have the rest of your life to be mediocre like most of us here.My gf was kicked out of her aunts home when she was  years old she originally moved in with her aunts family since her parents were no longer around and she moved in with a friends family afterwards. She doesnt drink or do drugs and isnt a troublemaker in any way but her aunt just decided to kick her out one day and she has been on her own ever since. She is a survivor which is something I find very appealing in her personality. I dont think she would have been nearly as resilient had this happened to her in later life. She now has a stable job and has reconnected with family with whom she is very close.Whatever you choose good luck and best wishes for you.TLDR Life is short and you never know where youll end up so do the crazy stuff while youre still young.,Frugal,cght9rc,2,t5_2qhbe

690823,0,t3_222lny,How many HVAC zones do you have?  I am assuming you have just one system.  Is it a ducted central system or do you have a throughthewall Packaged Terminal Air Conditioning PTAC unit?  With a ducted system you can close off dampers in the supply registers in all of the rooms except your roommates but this would depend on the location of the thermostat.I would also highly recommend reviewing the utility rebates offered in your area through the Database of State Incentives for Renewables amp Efficiency Many utility companies have very attractive rebate programs and are obligated to comply with Efficiency and Renewable Portfolio Standards for their state. LED lamps are often close to free with the rebates and these reduce lighting power consumption by around  incandescent vs. LED with a proportional decrease in heat output  watts of heat instead of  watts.  The electricity reduction alone often pays for the lamp at  in a little over a year.  Also a programmable thermostat will be worth its initial cost and likely comes with a  rebate from the utility for the cost.  Even better an internetaccessible thermostat e.g Nest Ecobee can allow rooms to setback automatically perform optimal start and be configured remotely.  A used Nest can be purchased for  discounted with utility rebates and may save roughly  or more per year this is typical but depends on a lot of other factors. Insulation is not likely to be feasible or necessary.  In an apartment building interior walls and floors contain little or no insulation.  Cooling your apartment to  will provide free cooling to all of your adjacent neighbors through the walls and floors.  Setting your setpoint higher than everyone else will have the opposite effect in cooling mode with an economically beneficial effect.  The way the utilities are billed to your apartment i.e. meter per unit or allocated will drastically impact the consequences of your energy conservation effortsless incentive to save will allocated bills.,Frugal,cgisrha,1,t5_2qhbe

Review your electric gas internet wireless bills regularly.Use online banking to automate bill paying or give any billers that need it my bank account info so they can do automatic withdrawals. This helps stop any patterns of missing bill payments. Then the next trick is timing your bill paying to make sure you have plenty of money in your accounts.For any major expenses try to buy used at thrift or pawn shops they will have reasonable quality at far cheaper prices but you have to shop around.Try to develop sideline incomes to boost your income while giving you control of your time. Like some people will go on craigslist or other sites pick up stuff for free and then resell it.Or you can do gardening or sewing or many hand skill ways to make money on the side.In the end its about controlling what you spend and making sure you get the best deal possible wherever you spend it.,Frugal,cgtqvex,2,t5_2qhbe

804536,0,t1_cgvq3qu,It depends. We started hanging our clothes to dry rather than use a dryer. A dryer wrecks havoc on clothes especially cheaper ones. Theyll wear much more quickly.

When we cant hang them outside we use an indoor clothesline.I have shirts I have had for a long time over  years that have only begun to fray at the collars. I think they are Van Heusen.

823984,0,t1_cgxq8y1,To clarify something on this At first cooking from scratch is going to feel just as expensive because youll have to buy a lot of stuff you dont normally keep around the house particularly building up a nice collection of spices.  But after a few months you should have a nice stock of nonperishable stuff in your pantry and a good collection of recipes you feel good about making.At that point youll be able to just go to the store and be like Lets grab some chicken and onions... without even knowing exactly what youre gonna use them on and yet youll be confident that youll be able to make  great meals out of just that and what youve already got at home.  Thats when the cost savings really start to show.Another good quick tip Buff up your recipes by adding cheap fillers like rice beans or corn.  For example if youre going to make tacos mix in some pinto beans andor rice with the beef.  Adds a couple more meals for only a buck or less.,Frugal,cgxxt4z,59,t5_2qhbe

No you can makeup whatever crap you want.

826110,0,t1_cgy6hos,Stage three is testingThis one is pretty simple try the store brand of everything at least once. Half the stuff we buy is store brand because it is either the same or better qualitytaste for less money. We wont buy the store brand if we dont like it though.We still only buy Heinz ketchup Oscar Meyer bacon ONLY on sale and like  packages at a time even if the sale is at Walgreens Contadina canned tomatoes for spaghetti sauce and Barilla pasta etc.But we prefer the store brand mayo over HellmansBest Great Value trail mix is just as good as any name brand and Costcos olive oil is from California so it isnt cut with canola oil like the stuff imported from Italy and it is way cheaper for a much better product.When it comes to household goods Walmart has toilet paper that is nicer than Charmin for way less. We found that last one out by looking online at consumer tests and we agree with those results too.Also stop buying Tide or any liquid detergent. We have a huge bag of cheap powder detergent and then we mix that with some Oxiclean. The huge bag lasts nearly a year and we only buy a few tubs of Oxiclean a year. As far as I can tell my clothes are just as clean. It boggles my mind that Tide is the best selling product when it is so outrageously overpriced and a complete ripoff.On the the other hand powder dish detergent doesnt work too well for our dishwasher so we will still buy storebrand liquid for that.You just have to test and be honest about the results. Sometimes you have to throw a whole jar of something away because it is so nasty. Other times you will be amazed that you like the store brand that costs half as much way more than the name brand and dont know why you didnt try it sooner.Stage four is cooking techniques tricks and special ingredientsAs Ive said a few times being a foodie will seriously help if you want to eat amazing food for cheap. You need to know how and why to use certain techniques and the pitfalls of those techniques. The right preparation can take the cheapest cuts of meat and turn it into pure deliciousness. Look towards French cooking methods and techniques here. Almost their entire cuisine is built upon poor people figuring out the best methods to coax the most amount of awesome flavor out of the most basic and cheap ingredients.Although we personally dont use it as often as we should slow cookers will certainly turn even the cheapest meats and veggies into a delicious meal and youll definitely have leftovers for the next night too.This is all really going to help you get away from prepackaged bags and boxes of food for example ricearoni and switching to big bags of plain rice bulk beans in bags the ones you have to soak in water over night and cooking with flour and butter to thicken freshly created sauces.Also learn about a few key ingredients. Order fleur de sel in a huge bag on Amazon and use that to finish off salads meat or just about anything that you want to salt after the cooking and even some things beforeduring. Figure out a few spiceherb combinations. Use citrus fruits to perk up a few dishes or dressings onions to add depth of flavor or even better sometimes use shallots and shave carrots into ground beef to make a larger amount that is healthier and gets more veggies into your diet without even knowing you are eating them. There are tons of ingredients and tricks to add flavor or stretch the amount of food out more. Look around online for ingredients restaurant chefs use to find out why restaurant food usually tastes better. Learning about  of the ingredients they use that you dont will immediately send your food to another level from then on.Stage five is learning how to make the most out of what you haveSo at this point you should be moving right along but you might have a decent amount of waste if you arent reusing leftovers. Sometimes you will just wind up making a huge recipe that has leftovers and yes you need to eat the same thing the next night. So make sure youre a good cook and want to eat it in the first place However the bigger wins are reusing the same ingredients in new dishes. Itll really really help if you are a foodie and love good food because taking the extra time to do some things means youll always be eating really well for really cheap.One of the best things you can do is buy a whole roaster chicken when they are on sale. Thats like  different dinners right there. Do a pretty basic roast dont get too fancy with marinades. Ideally the chicken comes out tasty being only oiledbuttered amp saltedpeppered with maybe a few herbs cut up and sprinkled over top and stuff it with some onion citrus fruit and more herbs.Then you can eat either the drumstickthighs or the breasts for dinner that night with some side dishes. Butcher the rest of the meat off after dinner and store it in tupperware or Ziploc bags. At this point my fiance would save the carcass as well for homemade chicken stock which is far superior to the box stuff and pretty simple but if you arent ready for that yet dont do it.Either way though the next night she would likely make a soup with some chopped up fresh veggies rice or pasta herbs and someall of the leftover chicken. That soup usually is enough for two dinners or maybe a dinner and a lunch.Butchering meat yourself is another great way to save money. This weekend we bought a ribeye roast for   off the normal price of  and then butchered it into steaks. We got  steaks out of it some bone in some boneless and all of them are big enough for us to split one steak between us for a meal. Last nights dinner was one of those steaks with fresh ovenroasted asparagus both of those marinated in the Costco olive oil and a sweet potato.We had some Kerrygold butter leftover from my birthday last weekend a nice splurge to make some clarified butter with fleur de sel added later to dip king crab legs into and melted that over top of the steak and sweet potato and finished with the fleur de sel.So what Im saying here is that we have  individual portionsservings of ribeye steak it cost us  per serving of meat and a few more dollars for all the other ingredients took about  minutes to cook and I ate a meal that tasted on par with what Id get at Saltgrass steakhouse for like  of the cost of going there.The best part was that there was so much food we couldnt finish all the steak last night. So we chopped it up into small pieces and had bits of ribeye in an omelet this morning As you can see eating cheaply doesnt have to mean skimping on quality  Not every meal we have is that nice but it isnt a rarity either.Stage six when you are loving all the great food you are eating for so little money is growing stuff yourself to have even fresher more flavorful food for even lessWe have an Aerogarden in the kitchen with a bunch of herbs because we love cooking with fresh herbs or infusing mint into water such. It was an expensive upfront purchase but the quality of the herbs being freshly cut right before cooking is way superior to the tiny  plastic containers which are really expensive themselves. If you have a green thumb go ahead and plant them the old fashioned way. The spot we have the Aerogarden sitting on in the kitchen gets no natural light and it was a cheap used one on eBay so it was worth it for us.But we also have a few tomato plants a jalopeno plant some rosemary and such growing outside as well. Its all more fresh and again despite the up front cost of potssoilseeds is way more bang for the buck over time.We havent gotten into canning yet but maybe that will happen over the summer when we cant possibly eat or give away all the tomatoes coming off the plants. I guess that is stage seven for us All of this has been about a year and a half of testing learning and getting better at all of it. Its a process. But even just starting with stage one is going to get you huge wins.At this point we prefer staying home to going out because we generally eat better than we do at restaurants. If we do go out its either to very cheap ethnic cuisine places once in awhile Vietnamese pho joints Mexican taquerias Mediterranean for gyros etc. or the kind of high end restaurants that have a different menu based on what is fresh every night. And we can afford it because we save so much money on groceries and not going and having mediocre food at middleoftheroad restaurants.I hope this helps out ,Frugal,cgy6hxs,1,t5_2qhbe

Are you selling stuff to make money or selling stuff to get rid of it? I know a lot of people will say Well BOTH duh! but if you just want to get rid of stuff then mark it WAY down. It will sell fast if people think theyre getting an awesome bargain. If youre trying to make money then maybe take some of the higher priced items and list them on Craigslist. People are more likely to walk away at a yard sale when the price is too high whereas on Craigslist you get people who actually want the item.

They were used along with food stamps to reduce pressure on the public food supply. Around onethird of the vegetables produced by the United States were from victory gardens. In addition to indirectly aiding the war effort these gardens were also considered a civil morale booster  in that gardeners could feel empowered by their contribution of labor and rewarded by the produce grown.

999746,0,t3_25izgy,Im going to call out some horseshit in HoneyBs response.  Hes not necessarily wrong in most cases but hes way off target.A  hes right youre not going to be fabricating your own cells in any sort of DIY fashion.  Thats a frigging nobrainer and I think hes silly to think youre even going to start there.  Dumb.B you can buy just the cells all day long and put them together DIY in a not terribly complicated process.C  Now comes the frugal application part.  If you want to make your own DIY panels and throw them on your roof and tie them to the grid Ill tell you right now youre barking up the wrong tree.  Code requirements in most utilities require listed equipment installed by approved contractors  no DIY can ever touch the grid  it just isnt safe.  Having said that rebates exist in a lot of different utilities and can bring that cost down significantly... I install solar anywhere from .W down to .W  depending on the location and rebates involved and it can be an incredibly reasonable and feasible investment for you.  I highly suggest you call a local installer and have an introductory conversation. I do see a very feasible hobby in the way of DIY ing solar projects around the house.  Think stand alone projects taht could operate water pumps for rthe gardens gate motors at  the end of the driveway tiny toy robots garden sensors weather condition relays  all sorts of fun stuff.  This is just a tip of the iceberg page DIY electronics hobbies are a subindustry off the hook these days  there is a lot of diff info out there.  This kind of thing takes a modest understanding of electrical circuit building which can be fun and rewarding in its own part.  Any which way you cut it though unless youre set up iwth the skills and a halfdecent workbench already Id call this anything but frugal.   Back to the Gridtie because I am a solar dude and I love it  I do see it as a very frugal option.  My definition of frugal is extensive enough to allow the expenditure of large sums of money if the longgame investment is right.  And solar is a good long game.  I see ROIs in teh  year range on a system that has a year life span.  so youre looking at  years in which that expenditure is just plain saving you money and eliminating that portion of your bill  with most cases being in the  range.  And there are options out there for financing the loans which is not as good as cash but still reasonable if you cant make a lump sum contract.   And FYI just so you know what ballpark Im working with most system sizes are kW.  some roofs can fit a bit more some a bit less. kW .  .k Anyhow there you go.  Yes you can no no youre probably not going to.  and go start a conversation with a solar company  it is probably better than you might fear.,Frugal,chhxg7s,1,t5_2qhbe

You risk losing your job and being kicked out of the US.Im left with money management suggestions to defer expenses. Since your education payments have a hard completion date see if you can get a loan to cover expenses during the next few years and pay it back immediately after your education loan is paid off. In effect your borrowing money to pay off money you owe to spread out the payments from  years to  or  years.A bank might issue you a k line of credit which you can use to take kyear off those last  years.You can get creative for example you might offer your landlord month for rent but defer payment of it until end of .

Use it for fried rice under a spicy stir fry with kidney beans or jazzed up with a spicy sauce.     Try quinoa in it.

I check the DOT code for the date of manufacture.There are other reasons to buy used tires than just to save money. Most manufacturers of AWD vehicles strongly recommend that you keep the tread depth about the same on all four tires. That can be a problem when you lose a tire after putting  miles on a set. The solution is to buy a used tire with a tread depth that matches your remaining tires. eBay works best for this so you can match tire makemodeltread depth. Any reputable eBay seller will check the tire for the basics otherwise they will just get the tire back and get dinged on feedback.Edit reword,Frugal,cid8qf7,3,t5_2qhbe

1426254,0,t3_2afuxy,Like everyone said the copay should be the same. But if you have to have tests or anything diagnostic like an MRI done most of the time its significantly cheaper to stay away from a hospital setting even if its innetwork. Prices for imaging and tests vary greatly by location and the hospital doctors are likely to refer you to another section of the hospital.  Most of the time they dont know what those things cost anyway so its not that theyre purposely trying to get more money from you but its just easier to refer you to something convenient. A lot of employers are offering transparency tools as part of your benefits package. You might be able to look up prices through your insurance website or through a third party tool that your employer has subscribed to. ,Frugal,civ23ue,1,t5_2qhbe

1434161,0,t3_2ajrni,Selling anything involves risk.  I can hand make items out of string for . and sell on Etsy at christmas time and make  times my investment but during the rest of the year its gathering dust.  Sounds to me like you need some experience some practical management skills and to increase your expectations.  Take a course in small business management to learn your states laws for taxes and management at the local JC thats money well invested.After taking a course I bought two small mom and pop businesses that were failing for  each and I changed the build out added new equipment and a year later flipped them for double the cost plus profit after rebuilding the customer base.  I put that money into retirement money.  I started a hobby thinking I was done with owning a brick and mortar business and started selling new and used books online with about  investment saw no profit for almost six months after paying warehouse costs and over a year built up to  books online.  the more books I listed the more I made.  After a year we are making popcorn and movie money.  I keep this business because I have a developmentally challenged adult working with me and this is his primary source of income... plus it took a job trainer  months to get his job activity trained to him.   This business is now used on the books to offset profits of the corporation we are an S corp  as a loss and makes me feel good about keeping him hired. This store is just a hobby after all.    I then put it all into surplus sales.  Next I added drop shipping.   Then wholesale.  Then liquidated sales thru the government auction sites.  Half the warehouse is dedicated to bins of very diversified products.  My biggest investmentsuccess has been branded merchandise sales thru Amazon top  products are reviewed every day. On the side Im doing internet marketing  a cut throat fly by the seat of your pants investment with highs and lows that are not for the faint of heart and its making me money but only because it has also cost me time and effort to learn how to recover when I failed.  Ive invested money only to lose it quickly.  I had to learn who to talk to how to avoid sharks who is full of BS and where the big money leads.  Those guys who tell you to open a website and make big money.... for every  people who do this only one makes it big.  Check out Anik Sengal on YouTube.  Best advice right there!    My favorite selling item is hand soap that I buy wholesale.  The company makes it puts my label on it and then drop ships it for me.  I am making only pennies on it but that adds up in time.   I invested into this company two years ago and thru our mutual agreements I am able to sell it on Amazon and also independently on the web.  Hell I even sell it with a small markup to people who want to rebrand it for themselves but I am not telling them where I get it.... and they never ask...  People!       A few years back I bought plain old T shirts for . each tiedyed them then ripped them up to about the bra line did a macrame tie at the stop line and then sold them for  each by marketing to teens a x markup on hand made speciality Ts.  This only lasted one summer and gained me about  that year.  It went out of fashion quickly.   Ive also contracted with this Mom and Pop store for bulk items.... I ran a line of T shirts that I had silk screened messages on them that was very rude sold them on the secondary market flea market sales. and we all made a nice profit.  My latest T Shirt says Legalize Murder   I am constantly listening to people listening for ideas and risking money.  Ive invested in patents where Ill never see a dime and I keep working at it.  Understand that all of this happened after I turned .  Im not a young woman but I understand that making money thru employment will not make your rich but taking risks with your own money will.  If you want steady money get a financial advisor.  If you want risk the higher the risk the more the profit then save up that  until you have  and start from there instead.    ,Frugal,ciw1rpo,8,t5_2qhbe

I am. tablespoons of Italian seasoning. heaping tablespoons of caraway seed. This is a must for this recipe but also for any frugal pantry. The unique flavour of caraway seed adds a new dimension to flavour combinations that I think a lot of people overlook.Throw all of this in the bottom of the crockpot and mix it.Toss in about a pound and a half to two pounds of your preferred ground meat. I like about  ground beef and  pork sausage.Set on high and leave it alone maybe stirring every now and again if youre the kind of person who likes to micromanage.

1567890,0,t3_2c5gql,The best weddings I have been to have been the casual backyard ones so that is what I am doing for my own wedding. I also LOVE cooking so will be catering it myself. This has meant I can really push for a tiny guest list around  people plus their kids and everything will be very cheap wedding is at around .I also am not into weddings in general or dressing up so I am buying a cheap purple dress from China not having bridesmaids and my sister will do my hair and make up. A friends uncle is our celebrant and we are getting mates rates of  for him to marry us also.My dad and my fiances dad will take photos and a close friend will take the video. My fiance and I do not like posed photography so I dont even care if they look amateur. My fiance is making our wedding cake too  Not having flowers or favours who really cares about favours? Unless they are edible most people find them annoying especially ones with the couples name on it or stuff like that. Anyway I think weddings are a mega scam most of the time  I actually dont know anyone who has spent less than around  which I think is INSANE for one day. I could buy two motorcycles for that price or a boat or travel for months and months which are all things my fiance and I would prefer over a party for one day. ,Frugal,cjct46s,1,t5_2qhbe

1649138,0,t1_cjmqmxa,Yup. Your month budget comes out to an average of .meal and you can certainly do better than that.However I think youre going to have a a bit of a tough time trying to cut your meal cost to .meal so that you can achieve ubettybetsys suggestion of a  monthly grocery budget. Gradual changes are the easiest to adapt to and therefore youre more likely to actually stick with it sort of like how someone overweight is more likely to stick to a diet if calories are only reduced by say  per week over a few months rather than trying to instantly drop from  calories a day to  calories. If you each eat  meals a day thats around  meals a month so even dropping your meal cost by a small amount can make a noticeable difference. Id suggest aiming to reduce your total grocery bill to a minimum of month for now which is a savings of  compared to your current habits. Once youve adjusted to the new way of doing things for a month or two then you can consider whether youd like to cut it down any further.When thinking about how to plan your shopping and meal prep to cut costs keep snacks in mind too. With my giant  lb bag of almonds from Costco  IIRC if even that much and the Costco website shows you can get  lbs for . a  oz serving is a healthy snack for less than  cents. Not every meal will have the same cost either  if you plan ahead you can easily have breakfast for . including coffee lunch for  allocate  to a snack and then have dinner for  per serving for a meatseafoodbased dish for a total of  per person per day. When I was trying to cut costs for my family I focused on breakfast because my husband was going to Dunkin Donuts most mornings with his coworkers before their big meeting. I made bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches for him to bring to work which by my calculations cost no more than .sandwich if none of the ingredients were on sale and no more than . when English muffins and eggs were on sale yes I accounted for butter used to cook the eggs in the cost. You just need to convince yourself into spending the time on meal prep which isnt super fun I will admit but its more fun than being unable to afford a car repair because your grocery bill is out of control!,Frugal,cjn1cs8,1,t5_2qhbe

The big thing you want to do as a bachelor is get a crockpot and make some delicious crockpot recipes divide those up into mealsized portions and put those into tupperware. The beautiful thing about crockpot recipes is that most of them might have  minutes active prep time at the most and youll get anywhere from  servings out of them bringing your permeal prep time down to a few minutes. You can do it on the weekend or whatever days you have plenty of time and then have your food in the fridge ready to grab and go when your work week rolls around.It also doesnt hurt that the cooking is super easy. Just dump your ingredients into the pot set to low or high depending on when youd be ready to take care of the cooked meal and youre done.Check out budgetbytes.com.

I was bussing tables so my tips came directly from the sales of the servers.  During lunches and slow seasons sometimes the . of their sales was only .  But on the best shifts ever I could make  in a hour shift.  The problem didnt lie in fairness but reliabilitysteadiness of pay.  Thats why I switched over into having a set hourly wage without any tips whatsoever.  And hr is VERY very good in my area near Detroit where finding steady fulltime work is damn near impossible and the whole area is broke as hell so I cant complain about that at all.  And when the season gets slow and my hours get cut possibly thats not really unfair either its just the price I pay for living in an area with the shittiest winter of alltime last year and people not being able to even GET to my restaurant because theres  feet of snow and the roads havent been plowed.  If we cant pack the dining room we dont need  hosts scheduled. If the roads are so bad that no one even enters the restaurant for  hours they HAVE to cut people otherwise the restaurant will just go under eventually due to labor.

There was a time in history when the family was the essential unit of humanity.  Now the unit is the pairbond or the modern salaried independent highearner.Its also a time of unequaled loneliness depression mental illness and family dysfunction.Id love to be able to point to real data that would imply causeandeffect but the important thing I wish to ask you to consider is that the family as a survival unit is and was a much more successful entity than the individual.  I lived on my own for a decade both in the country and overseas and eventually came back around to really question this having seen many extended families living under one roof and in which the younger ones go out into the world to earn funds to bring back some to contribute to the overall good of the family.  It seemed a more successful model with less strain and less susceptible to economic swings.If you can ask this question and feel out the response with your parents and essentially join them in their struggle by contributing your own skills and ideas you might be able to combat this influence and become one of a new generation of people who recognize the way weve been misled into buying far more empty houses than we need more cars than we can afford and more gadgets to fill those empty places to take the place of the family weve chosen to separate from.,Frugal,cknoflg,14,t5_2qhbe

Youve told yourself that these things are necessities and that changes the cost from negotiable to nonnegotiable.

A home is a longterm investment. You dont need to do everything at once and trying to do so will cost more.

Large bottles bombers are sometimes cased in  typically belgian beers.Quantities less than a case are generally only sold at bars and restaurants and definitely not at convenient stores supermarkets or gas stations.A lot of this stems from puritanical laws from a long time ago.And yeah it is a good deal for restaurants and bars.

2111760,0,t1_cl86unu,While in transit the digital signal is no different than analog.  The difference is that an analogue signal uses the full spectrum available to it and the end point translates this directly into the data that it was expecting.  That means that noise along the way will change what the data looks like on the other end.Digital signals do not use the whole spectrum.  The receiving end looks for highs and lows to translate into s and s.  As long as the noise doesnt change the signal too much no data is lost or corrupted.  If the cable is particularly noisy you will lose quality or speed depending on how the system is handling data corruption. So a poor quality cable is still bad for digital signals.

My old oil boiler was on its last leg anyway I just needed to source a cheap boiler.... which only took a few days. During the winter months we went from about mo to hardly ever going over mo. More importantly people need to wear socks and shoes long sleeves and a hat when youre indoors. Adding a layer like a hoodie or insulated flannel shirt is helpful too. Theres no need to keep the temperature so high that you can walk around in a tee shirt.,Frugal,cl8o6oc,4,t5_2qhbe

2126951,0,t1_cl89ycn,Heres a few ideasIn the past Ive had great luck with choosing a few good recipes that are easy to cook up in bulk but also freeze well  just grab a bunch of freezersafe plastic takeaway containers from the dollar store or use tupperware if youve got enough cook up a big batch of one thing one night freeze what you dont eat in singleserving portions cook something different the next night and do the same etc. That way you can easily have a choice of  or  totally different healthy meals for at least a month or two that require all of  minutes in the microwave to repair. A great trick for figuring out what kind of recipes work is to look at the kind of meals that are popular in the frozen dinner section and the kinds that arent at the supermarket  my favourites are curries stews soups and lasagna. You can also just cook up individual ingredients in large batches then freeze singleserving portions in individual sandwich bags  Ive recently started doing this with brown rice and its great to have one less thing to worry about when preparing a meal of an evening. I just fry up some premarinated tofutempeh chuck some rice in the microwave steam some greens and Im good to go.Oh and then theres the goto cheap bachelor meal good quality frozen veggies good quality frozen meatvegetable patties or fried eggs then bread boiledmashed potatoes or ricequinoa on the side. Microwave veggies as needed fry one patty as needed boil a few potatoes as needed etc. Add with gravysalt and peppersaucebutterwhatever you like and youve got a tasty quick reasonably healthy meal.Ohh and heres one last recommendation for a weeks worth of nice lunches assuming youre okay with salads buy up a whole bunch of salad ingredients e.g. spinach kale arugula dandelion greens tomatoes carrot mushroom chickpeas kidney beans pine nuts walnuts pumpkin quinoa chicken tuna turkey or whatever you dig. Then for variety just mix and match them to make a weeks worth of interesting salads  spinach in one kale in another a mix of both in another one with chicken one with tuna one with neither etc. Put em in takeaway containers chuck em in the fridge and thats lunch sorted cheaply for the week. Use a different dressing every day for even more variety and youre gold  you could think about going to McDonalds or somewhere similar and buying a variety of their single serve dressing sachets but my personal recommendation is something similar to this image where you layer the ingredients with the dressing at the bottom so the whole salad doesnt get soggy then when you want to eat it just invert the whole thing into a bowl or shake it and eat it in the jarother container. I swear Im all out of ideas now haha. Hopefully Ive been of some help!,Frugal,cla6k60,1,t5_2qhbe

They key to a budget is to borrow from other categories you use to make it to the end of the budget.

Why?So banks cant lend your stocks out to shareholders and pocket the interest while your stocks go down.  I rent. Never own. Why?People think renting is flushing money down the toilet. ITs actually the reverse. Owning a house has all the characteristics of the worst investment possible  volatile returns big  of your net worth highly leveraged very illiquid particularly when you need the money negative carry maintenance fees and real estate taxes that often go up faster than inflation or the rent you can charge lack of mobility. Your salary is capped by the jobs in your area. Better is to take the down payment and invest in stocks or yourself. If you love real estate as an investment you can leverage up and buy residential REITS and take advantage of prophecies you might have.

Nobody in the history of the planet has starved on  meals a day. Plus...no alcohol. Some people wont like this. But alcohol is a poison and there are better ways to lose inhibitions and get over nervousness.  No ks or IRAs. Thats just a way for your employer to transfer money from himself to rich fund managers who charge all sorts of hidden fees. You probably lose a good  a year if you use IRAs or ks. Insurance. Only in case of catastrophe. Losing legs strokes etc. Incapacity insurance. Why?  REPORTED doctorrelated deaths a year from malpractice. Theres probably much more.

When you calculate the cost of storage you could replacements. Also those that said refinance your cars. Im guessing your credit isnt good enough to do that or you would be paying so much interest in the first place. I agree with trying to sell one car and if possible both. And then buying a cheaper car that runs well perhaps an old Toyota for instance. Until you have more money an uglier car is fine. It just has get you from A to B safely and reliably.

What I mean by that is using less than  is considered bad.  Using  is a lot better.This doesnt mean you cant pay it off every month  I do but I make sure not to pay things off super early.  Wait for the statement to come that says I have a balance of  or whatever then pay it off right before it is due.  That way you never pay interest but the balance gets reported and it seems like you are actually utilizing it.Regarding the new card stuff if you close a new card it still hurts you because the card stays on your credit report for a number of years before it drops off.  So your average account age takes an immediate hit as soon as you open a new card and then continues to get better regardless of whether you keep it open or close it soon however if you close it soon then it will be many more years ? ? ? I cant recall before it is completely gone and your average account age will jump up.Edit  talks about average age of accounts open and closed accounts age the same. Closing a CC has no affect on average age of accounts or credit history length  What this means is that if you have a  year card and open a new card your average age is now  years.  If you immediately close the new card your average age is still  years.  In  years one card will be  years old and one card will be  years old and your average age will be  years.

Low can be used if you risk tripping your breaker or are afraid of burning yourself but otherwise you can just go with high. of the energy put into the heater will be converted to heat. The reason the space heater is so frowned upon is that other means of heating are MORE than  efficient e.g. heat pumps or using something cheaper than electricity.So if you need x amount of heat you will need to put in x amount of power. How you do that is irrelevant but tryimg to keep a steady temperature will be most comfortable.Oilfilled also takes a while to heat up. This doesnt affect the efficiency but trying to use it burstily will only result in the room feeling cold for a while until the heater has caught up.So set the thermostat to a comfortable setting or slightly below if you want to masochistically save money and leave it there for as long as you need the heat.,Frugal,cmi553i,1,t5_2qhbe

2516757,0,t3_2oea9i,There is I believe a difference between increasing R value and rendering a window airtight.  The volume of air trapped by the plastic certainly would increase the R value of the window but the elimination of insideltgtoutside air movement is the biggest help as far as I can tell.  I used shrink film on relatively NEW windows and noticed that my heating bills went down even though last winter was colder than the previous.  Bubble wrap might increase the R value but unless youre sealing it down it would still permit air movement.

Its worth it to pay a bit more to get a consistently good haircut than have to go back to get it fixed after a botched one. Also you typically have the option to just get your hair cut without the blow dry or styling which should cost less. If your hair is curly or wavy its also at least slightly coarse.

If all youre getting is static its possible you might not have a digital TV or it might be dual or hybrid type that is capable of receiving digital or analog signals and you just dont know how to get it into digital mode. If its not a digital TV you have to buy something called a converter box. This converts the digital signal into an analog format that can be recognized by your TV. You plug the box into the TV and the antenna into the box so the box can receive a clear signal. Converter boxes are relatively cheap. I hope this helps.

You were spending day on food but not making crabapple sauce from fruit in a nearby park or dumper diving and you had a phone and were not using a government provided messaging service employment centers provide this in Ontario via a local payphone. Seen it and rent was still regularly late at some point you walk away from the apartment and relocate to a town where your skills are of better use. Past self might think you were pretty damn well off in that situation.No matter how hard it is waiting until an emergency to fix the revenue or expense issue is far worse.,Frugal,cnjofwd,1,t5_2qhbe

Another thing is that sometimes the burritos are pre microwaved and sit in a  heater until you order them. We are supposed to throw out old food but no one ever set the timer on the heater to determine when that is so nothing ever got thrown out. Also if you want anything made fresh tell the cashier when youre ordering. They will make anything fresh to order. Theres a lot of bad practices and health violations I saw I my McDonalds.

2877347,0,t1_cnv0ywh,I am not sure if this is exactly what you are looking for but from an Economics standpoint theres been a long running idea that welfare would work better if states gave it out as a flat sum rather than in form of excise taxes or subsidies directed at specific goods like healthcare food or education. Essentially its a negative income tax where once your income is low enough the state actually pays you.It is a pretty interesting idea thats been around for a while. Milton Friedman a famous conservativelibertarian monetary economist advocated for it. It has support with some high standing economists and Switzerland recently looked to create a negative income tax in its borders. Some people like it because they see it as decreasing bureaucracy and government while still providing ideally similar welfare.Another part of the justification comes from the idea that a state does not need to hold the hand of the poor. The state can give low income earners money and theyll know how to use it best to their situation. So I know that some arguments related to negative income taxes and basic incomes have tied into studies where organizations gave flat sums to homeless people to turn their lives around. There was a Guardian article that I think covered a study where homeless people got a flat unconditional lump sum of money and actually did really well with it but I could not find where it was. There are some more mathematical studies and various sources against the idea too but I am just not all about digging those up right now.Heres an article on a big study on the development end of itEDIT  Switzerland article ,Frugal,cnv5mew,19,t5_2qhbe

Only pay them minimum wage no benefits.You are right about the hype these schemes to suck the US taxpayers dry and leave the US en empty shell of misery I think are almost certainly part of why they want the totally wrong ISDS SO much and wont discuss dropping itYou are right not only are they overselling it but astroturfers are scanning blogs like tis one and drowning out any posts about how oversold this resources is  and anything criticising TTIP TPP or TISA gets voted down.. Fast track is coming maye as soon as the enxt few days pease write and call them everything hinges on it.See this article for exampleInsiders Sound an Alarm Amid a Natural Gas RushThats why they want a huge bailout when the US freaks out and not realizing they both probably planned it this way all along and that even pulling out of the deal will not prevent the selling to the highest bidder part which is also irreversible and a WTO rule.. But the recent Yukos  billion euro fine  for violating a provisionally applied trade treaty that the Duma never approved!!!   shows what awaits us if we sign TTIP and then reeling from the jumps and job losses pull out  which will not fix anything except trigger demands for expected lost profits which will be hugely inflated..

Even though it ends up costing me more money in the long run its easier and not worth the headaches to be constantly toggling a power strip. Given the logistics of my house the router had to go in the living room on the main level.  Office and bedrooms are one level above and theres  no space on the main level for either.So if I hit the power strip I cant just roll out of bed in the morning and go surf the net.  Ill have to go all the way downstairs dodge cats hit the switch pray the modem boots up and then hike back upstairs.A second power strip isnt feasible or desirable either as the closest grounded outlet is on the other side of the room and Im already running one  outlet strip with a twenty foot cord around the room just to make things work.And when you have an old house grounding wires isnt as easy as it would seem.,Frugal,cnyap3o,3,t5_2qhbe

And the answer is always Why do you think you deserve a k discount? And no one ever has an answer.How about because I dont think its worth k? I mean... really? Why do you deserve a discount? Why does that person deserve to sell their item at k?Its amazing how passive consumers have gotten over the past  or  years. We no longer understand that money is a collective fiction and that prices are things that have to be agreed upon by two parties. We think oh the price of this thing is set by the seller and if I dont like it I cant have the thing and surely someone else will come along who will buy it if I dont. Only a lot of times they dont and the seller ends up wasting large chunks of time relisting and rerelisting and so forth.Its possible to be an asshole about this of course. But its not a requirement.gt Not a very good way to build rapport with a salesman.And when I get home I like to count the rapports with a salesman that I have collected. I find them very fulfilling.Oh no wait. His job is to sell you things. Hes building a rapport with you so you will spend more money. Im not saying he doesnt actually like you many salespeople are very friendly and agreeable people. But its also their job to get you to spend as much money as they can.

Take one packet yeast mix it with  C warm water. Add TB oil  to  TB salt and . C flour you can also add dried italian herbs or garlic if you like. knead it on a floured surface for  minutes or until its smooth and elastic.

I almost never buy anything I keep Im pretty minimal but I have a pretty good eye and am knowledgeable about vintage items. My rules to control spending I limit my buys only to items I can make a minimum of  net on and will sell in less than  months. If an item is worth over  net I will buy it even if it takes a little longer to sell. This does mean I pass up a lot of items I could make small amounts on but the time isnt worth it to me. Nor is the space it all would take up on my house. Most shops I just aim to find one or two big price items over  and that more specific harder hunt is actually more exciting. Its like a game I take great pleasure in winning.I have been doing this part time as time allows since I have a busy day job and a lot of social commitments and generally I make over  a year net It gives me a healthy shopping high helps me pay for some extra experiences in my life and it also keeps me up to date with vintage buying trends and research.

His wife had the notion that hes the man of the house and that only he should provide. He has a daugther  at the time who wasnt working either. He told me he wanted it that way so that she could focus on school. He would call me ever so offend to off load his stress. I then told him straight and simple. Your wife and daughter need to get jobs. I made it clear to him the days of the single provider are gone. And its not about you or her. Its about your family as a whole. If  he were to fail then his whole family would fail. A couple of months after that both wife and daugther got jobs and all is now well. Find a way for your spouse to generate extra income. You will be a lot less stressed. Trust me. Oh another point I made to him is that living paycheck to paycheck is not good.

Theres really no need to chase the newest models down for photograph printers because their yields are not getting much better they all have nice resolution and the manufacturers price for inks is going to be constant for  years or so.

In reality its so close to being good but in reality almost everyone has a car or relies on someone else with a car because its so close. Anytime it snows which you know it does  months out of the year the T pretty much comes to a stand still buses are constantly late and due to the just stupid nature of the hub and spoke system it can be faster to WALK then to take public transit. its certainly faster to bike hour Trides can often be accomplished in  min bike ridesTo give you an example there is is a fairly major shopping area near me that is . miles from my house and I live in a pretty populated square and am within easy walking distance to one of the biggest squares in the area. Public transit options are take the red line all the way into the city then take the orange back out which would take an hour or taking the bus such a distance as to require at least  min of walking on either end which is hell in the snow because the city doesnt shovel properly and on top of that the walking on one end would be through a very sketchy area under some elevated highways plus the bus is going to be late. Or I can be there in my car in literally  min.

3536384,0,t3_30o34d,You seem to have a good plan but if youre physically able learn how to do your own repairs because then you wont have to wait for repair people to show up.  Most repairs arent that hard factory repair manuals are very good and not too expensive some websites let you download them free and theyre worth reading just to help you protect yourself from dishonest or incompetent repair people and loads of YouTube videos give clear instructions some of the best being on RepairClinic.coms channel.  Learn to use basic hand tools and a digital multimeter but if youre going to work on high voltage Id avoid the cheapos like the ones Harbor Freight gives out free with coupon and instead get something thats safety approved by UL CSA or ETL.  Sometimes electronic circuit boards develop bad contacts or cracked solder from vibration and appliance repair people rarely fix those but instead replace the whole board at much higher cost.   Also for electronically controlled appliances learn how to reset the computer because lots of appliances generate false alarms and just unplugging the AC power may not reset them.   You may want to read the Made By Monkeys column at DesignNews.com to see how engineers deal with their badly made or badly designed appliances.  What others said about extended warranties being highly profitable.  I think the markup is  over the expected payout and I once heard a Sears manager tell two new employees You dont need to know anything about your products.  You only need to know how to sell PAs.  PA  Protection Agreement or extended warranty or service plan.  The companies that back extended warranties have long tended to be financially rickety not just Sears so  Id worry about this unless the warranty was offered directly by the product manufacturer Kenmore is not a manufacturer most Kenmore appliances are Whirlpool some LG or Frigidaire.

3662595,0,t3_32arvv,I did this once with Huggies diapers about  years ago when my oldest was a baby.... Imagine a  month old with rotavirus and explosive diarrhea. Youre changing about  explosive diapers a day this is no exaggeration.... You use the last diaper in the diaper stacker and dont have enough time to restock from the new box before babys butt explodes again.... Now babys poopy again and youre frantically trying to hold baby still with one hand and tear into the new box with the other. You pull out a diaper then begin cleaning up the poopy baby. You get to the tail end of the diaper change and you pull out the tabs to fasten the new diaper shut but theres no velcro. The tabs are there but theres no velcro to actually hold the diaper closed. You think its a fluke grab another diaper go to put it on baby but its the same. No velcro...  diapers in and still no velcro.... Now youre running around with a screaming half naked baby looking for something to hold a diaper shut so you can go through the big box of diapers to figure out how many are effected by the missing Velcro and whether or not youre going to have to send someone to the store for more diapers cant bring a rotavirus baby to the store.... Baby decides this is the perfect time for a bath and lets loose with explosive diarrhea down the front of you.... Yeah that totally happened. lol I laugh now but at the time I was very frazzled and upset. Baby ended up in the hospital that night from the rotavirus. I forgot about the diaper issue until we got home from the hospital. I ended up calling the company and told them what happened. I sent them a couple of the diapers and they ended up mailing me vouchers for  free boxes of diapers.  more kids and I still use Huggies brand.

Open the windows at night and cool down inside as much as possible. Open the windows as soon as outside is cooler than inside and leave them open until the temperature begins to increase usually I close them right when the sun comes up and I get up to go to work. This maximizes your cooling.. Close up tight during the day. Close all shades as well. Deflect as much light as you can this way. Rely on your insulation to keep you cleared out.. For increased cooling effect in step  put a box fan in a window pulling air in. This speeds up the cooldown. I do this on my second floor bonus room since it is above a garage and has  exposed walls leading it to be hottest. . Use fans and ceiling fans to increase the feeling of cool inside.

While it is possible to achieve great things from both schools it is much harder out of the CUNY. You have to be really proactive and look for oppurtunities. In an Ivy League the oppurtunities are literally right in front of you. Your efforts are amplified. I think when considering schools you have to take into account everything. I wouldnt pay  for a school undergrad no matter how good it was and I would rather be super proactive than go into that much debt. However I also wouldnt choose a school just based on the fact that is the cheapest option. You have to weigh several things and I think one mistake that kids make is that they weigh the name of the school too much. They have to look at everything and consider what they want to study. The differences in recruiting are night and day at some places. There was absolutely no recruiting at my school. The fucking NYPD came to the career fair and you had a bunch of low level sales positions. You had low paying tutoring centers and some other cold calling insurance positions. The job boards are a joke. You really have to be super proactive.  At the ivy league you had companies come to you to actively recruit and you got actual face time in with the recruiters. The online job boards are really good and you have a bunch of good choices. Even being proactive it took me over a year to find an internship in my field out of the CUNY it is super competitive in my area right now. It makes a difference. Students just have to figure out how much that difference is worth paying for. ,Frugal,cr5jjjq,16,t5_2qhbe

You are not likely to find a better unbiased and evenhanded review of vehicles anywhere.CRs ratings are based not only on their quantifiable and uniform testing but also on OWNER satisfactionreliability surveys as well as recall and TSB histories.  Ive kept up with them for  years since I bought my second new car in  a model I still drive today  theyve been consistent the entire time.Another way of looking at it  Consumer Reports is HATED by some manufacturers because of consistently low ratings on some models.  In the many many decades theyve been testing and rating cars if there was any chance that their methods were questionable dont you think one or more of those manufacturers would have created a notorious scandal out of it?

4062559,0,t3_373d1v,I think its an interesting point youve brought up which is that being frugal isnt strictly about money management but also can have an impact on your social life. It really isnt discussed enough frankly. It doesnt sound to me like your friends arent actually questioning your money management but rather they dont understand why youre being so careful with it and because they are your friends are taking a more needling approach. They probably see it as something thats ok to do because you guys are all so familiar. It might be that youre quite vocal about your moneysaving and that can be grating for other people  chances are youre doing it without realizing which is what prompted this. People dont just randomly start belittling other peoples moneymanagement choices. I have a friend who is FANTASTIC with money he must have around k in savings but he talks about how much he saves how much things cost what percent of his paycheque etc etc constantly. Its a little much to be discussing money ALL THE TIME especially when other people dont prioritize it the way you do. If youre doing this its likely making them feel kind of bad so they took the opportunity last night to just pile on in a semiserious way to possibly knock you off your highhorse. Im not saying you are on a high horse just that this is one possibilityThe reality is that when you have money and choose to not spend your money on various frivolities youre opting out of that particular social scene... the more times you do it the less people will even see you as being part of that scene its different if you are massively broke. And you know what its a tradeoff. Unless you can find a way to join them on outings and not shell out tons of cash and be discrete about it.Either way make money less of an issue with your friends.

He probably also wants to know what price he can quote you to get the most and close the deal. An apartment complex has to make sure you meet legal qualifications set by the government. Sorry I thought you were asking about subreddits in particular not real life situations. But yes if you are dealing with a salesmen and they ask your budget its to help them make a sale but not always with nefarious intentions towards you. Car dealer probably is just looking to see what he an squeeze out of you. A camera salesmen is going to help you walk out with a camera that fits you and your budget that day. A real estate agent will almost always try to show you a house on the higher end of your budget so they get the biggest commission. An accountant is going to clean up your budget to make you happy and keep you coming back. Edit salesmen are not personal researchers. They are salesmen. Im sure a lot of them would be irritated and consider it a waste of their time if someone had no intention of buying a product and just wanted to be informed of whatever they have to offer. A budget kind of assures them you are serious and not going to just use them as a real life google. ,Frugal,ct2ozhb,1,t5_2qhbe

At that point theyd look into the print job and see you were printing copyrighted material and you could get into legal trouble as well as face disciplinary action at the school. A professional place like Kinkos would also probably notice what you were doing and may refuse on the grounds of copyright infringement.This is one of those times where frugal does not equal felony copyright infringement and where you get what you pay for.

The inapp goals and budgeting are really useful and the main balance you see is Safe To Spend which subtracts the money set aside in goals. That works incredibly well for me. Im a college student and switched over because they have no fees. I stayed because the app is beautiful and immediately alerts me when Ive swiped my card I can disable my card temporarily anytime I feel way more organized with my money and best of all live people respond to you via message and phone and everyone Ive talked to is really great and explains answers clearly. Bill pay mobile check upload and external bank transfers Ive used a lot and like. The drawbacks No savings account or credit card I have these with another bank. No physical checkbooks billpay works great. No physical bank they have partnerships with tons of ATMs so no fees but Ive never used them. The external bank transfer takes a couple days. It really is basic and simple and for me that makes my life way easier to manage. Ive saved money thanks to them.

4778163,0,t1_ctv619f,Well it doesnt all go as heat I guess  the sound coming from your freezer is wasted energy too but its minimal compared to the heat generated. Cooling mechanisms fridge  AC etc generally work by passing fluid through a pressure gradient such that when running through the refrigerated area it is in a cooling state where it absorbs heat and then the pressure is changed as it passes through a heatsink on the backunderside of said fridgefreezer the heat is given off. This is how AC works and I believe similar mechanisms apply to fridgesfreezers. Basically its all about carrying the energy away from the inside of the freezer in the form of heat. Anything above  Kelvin  Celsius contains some energy in the form of heat. ,Frugal,ctwtukq,1,t5_2qhbe

The only thing I would do different is choose a different venue. Having a nice view was important to me so we picked a golf course that was on the pricey side for the reception. I should have looked at every single golf course available. I only looked at two. In the end the view was nice but not really important. It was the most fun day of my life and I will always remember the details that made it so special. ,Frugal,cuazve9,1,t5_2qhbe
4890903,0,t3_3hu1pg,Our wedding was roughly . Biggest expense by far was our photographer at k. Wife didnt want to scrimp on that. We kept our costs low by  having  a friend cook BBQ for us and borrowed a smoker from another friend . I sourced the pork butt myself.  used our wedding party to help with food prep.  Made  side salads so reheating wouldnt be a problem.  made pasta and sauce for rehearsal dinner.  Used same church space.  Made the pesto and tomato pasta sauce months in advance and froze them.  used the churches commercial kitchen. Since we were already paying for the space  we got to double dip.  reception was in a real barn. Had to rent ports potties but split cost with another friends wedding using the same barn. Also split decorations with them.  The barn cost  dollars since it wasnt an official venue. Family members were the Mc. high school girl wanted to start a wedding coordinator business. We let her be ours and she only charged a we paid her my wife loves dry flowers so she bought them ahead of time and made bouquet and boutineer.  my suit was an Armani off eBay.    maybe  after tailoring. she wore her grandmothers wedding dress but tailored it to look more modern. Dry cleaning the dress was .  Tailored by a friend as a gift.  I put together a play list and had another friend run it.  my sister and I gave a swing dance lesson before dancing. cakes   we gave  friends the recipe for a queen of sheba cake.  They each made  and brought it.  Its a very rich  and dense cake so you didnt need volume. pastor  my uncle and aunt are both Methodist pastors so they offficated jointly and helped us plan the ceremony.  a buddy is a hobby brewer so I had him help me make  gallons of hard cider.  It was mostly  my labor and his advice.  A box of trader Joe buck chuck also on hand.  after wedding next day brunch for friends was at  my mother in laws house.  We made crepes ahead of time and froze them. Easy reheat. when we made our getaway we gave everyone dried lavender to throw.  Bad idea! Enthusiasm plus dried lavender equals shrapnel.  Very painful to run that gauntlet  my wife scoured Craigslist for free Mason jars and washed them.  Used for drinks. She also cut small wood rounds and wrote guests names on them.  Adding a small ribbon and she tied them to the jars  we grew  a ton of herbs in small pots and used them as center pieces  used huge roll if butcher paper as table clothes paid local youth group to set up and tear down chairs and tables. We used the same churches tables and chairs and silverware. We had  people in attendance and froze tons of wedding leftovers. We dont feel like we really compromised at all and loved every minute. The biggest advise I can give is to use your community and relationships.  We  come from big Mennonite families and so our culture is one of helping out. Good luck!

4911803,0,t1_cud5r0y,I just moved a few weeks ago and did this too.  Ive always rented a uHaul and had friendsfamily help out but this time I couldnt get anyone to help and I didnt want to ask random people on Craigslist so I looked into hiring movers.  I was only moving about  minutes away so all told they were around for . hours and it cost about .  They moved all my heavy furniture most to the nd floor of the new place disassembled and reassembled the bigger items and hauled all the boxes I didnt have time to move myself.  Very quick and very professional and knowing I didnt have to do any of that myself made it very much worth the money.Another tip that kinda goes against the frugal grain get Home Depot or Lowes boxes.  Search Craigslist and see if someone is selling them cheap or even giving them away but if you cant find any dont be afraid to buy them new they arent as expensive as they used to be.  I bought enough boxes actually more than I needed from Home Depot to move my sq ft apartment for about .  My aunt who was helping me move wanted to go storetostore asking for left over produce boxes and I realized wed probably spend more time and money driving around asking around for uneven sized used boxes than we would just buying them new.  After the move return the unused ones and sell at discount or give away the ones you did use.If your definition of being frugal only includes money then what I wrote probably isnt what youre looking for.  I consider time and energy spent almost as important as money spent though and in both cases above I felt the added money spent helped save a lot of time and energy.,Frugal,cudo44a,2,t5_2qhbe

We were gifted a membership so will use it anyway but probably wont renew in a year.

As a suggestion OP might see if he could get a free estimate from a licensed contractor if his contract allows him to do so. It may not be that the Landlord is trying to save money it may be that she doesnt want to do major construction. Landlords also have mortgages to pay and sometime theres not a lot left over after that. Also there is no reason why the relationship has to be adversarial unless OP was making it that way to try and undo his lease somehow. He does have lamps and lights for that room so its not exactly like he is living in the dark here.

5319440,0,t3_3nvbsf,Rechargeable batteries in AA form factor are pretty much all NiMH these days so theres a few quick things to noteA A fully charged NiMH cell will selfdischarge down to about  within a few days. Eneloop and other LSD cells are the exception.B Dont trust a cheap charger for most of these cells especially if it cant charge a single cell on its own. Charging two cells in series is like filling two gas tanks from one pump  you lose a lot of accuracy A decent charging unit on Amazon costs  or so but it will greatly extend the lifespan of your cells and that pays for itself after about  recharges.A few examples of high draw devices that are well suited to NiMH Remotecontrol cars and toys Game controllers AAtoUSB power packs Cameras Arduino or hobby electronics projectsRemote controls are usually not well suited to NiMH because their .V cell voltage is already lower than a primary cells .V and that just means theyll brown out faster. This doesnt apply for game controllers since most of them have an internal voltage converter these days.What you should consider for yourself is how many devices you have that youre changing batteries for and how often. If all you have is a lowdrain TV remote then its not a wise choice but if youre interested in an RC car or camera then buying some rechargeables is a very good idea.,Frugal,cvrmcrx,19,t5_2qhbe

5471881,0,t3_3pxqnk,When I bought my house about ten years ago my parents bought me a used washer and dryer for  as a house warming gift. That was huge a we are not a family that buys big gifts and b I had been doing laundry in laundry mats for about a decade since I moved out at . I didnt care how dented old and scratched they were being able to do laundry in my house was a luxury to me and still is!!Ten years later my thirty year old washing machine is still going strong. I have replaced a belt did it myself and removed a few stuck socks did it myself and nothing else. It is not an energy hog despite being old and it cleans my clothes perfectly. The dryer did break down and the fix is a new motor but I started hanging my clothes to dry when it did break and decided not to replace it as I prefer hang drying now. In fact this weekend my dryer is finally going to be sold as scrap. I will never replace my washing machine as long as I can find parts and fix it myself. The local repair shop who sells parts tells me I have one of the best machines ever built and has offered to buy it from me a few times. They have been in business for  years so I trust their judgement and say no each time. Its all personal observations but I know lots of friendsfamily that have replaced their machines a number of times since I got mine. Lots of leaks broken doors and motor failures. I tell you this based on my personal experience I would never buy a front loader and even now I still occasionally say thanks to my parents for my set. ,Frugal,cwb31q7,5,t5_2qhbe

5479063,0,t3_3q27xu,dont buy gas from the rest stop stations unless you must.. go into the nearest town to eat and get gas but not if its more than a mile or two. Buy snacks or food you can bring with you at a supermarket. Check for discounts on gas cards from a reputable source. Fatwallet or slickdeals has recently had some deals  off a  gas card or gift card you can get on ebay. pay for the card with a cash back credit card... if you are a warehouse club member map out the stores on your route save on gas.Mainly dont waste time.. be on the road as early as you can and there will be less traffic... when I use to drive across country i would actually start about pm the night before and drive overnight with no traffic until morning i had to pass through DC and the beltway so i made sure i was through that before the traffic started.. Traveling on a sunday also seems good you can get a good full day of driving in with no traffic and fewer cops.. but remember everything is closed so you really have to be sure of the route.which is another thing.. if you are at home with a computer and planing your route.. you should travel it with google maps.. its not quite as good as having been there before but you might see some off ramps or other things that are tricky .. or like i said find stores that arent right at the highway exit for gas and food,Frugal,cwc027i,2,t5_2qhbe

Democrats want to standardize on Common Core which doubles down on teaching math in this terrible way I bet you most who are in favor of Common Core have not actually looked at the math section and Republicans want to reduce testing standard requirements so no matter who wins math teaching is unlikely to improve in any way.

5499577,0,t1_cweksa3,A title status has nothing to do with a way a vehicle has been serviced. You would be surprised at how insurance declares a car not worth fixing or worth fixing and at what point in a vehicles life is it better to give it a salvage title or not. For example a  toyota Camry with comprehensive coverage with a  mph fender bender can be given a salvage title by the insurance company because it is not worth fixing. A  subaru wrx sti that got rear ended at  mph will not get a salvage title because the insurance company adjustor will see it is cheaper to fix than to buy out the vehicle from the owner.

Buy the candy in bulk restock what sells fastest. Small bags of chips are great in offices. So are the big cup o soups cost bout . at sams or cosco can sell to co workers for . Not to mention pop soda for all you backward speaking mongoloids othersTake the cash and buy yourself lunch once or twice a week.With just a bit of effort you can exploit your coworkers laziness Help the office out and make some money on the side.We focus so much on saving pennies in this sub instead of looking for ways to make nickels.Your coworkers want to save time too. To them you are the crazy one going to the subway to pick them up a sandwich for  cents of profit.Likewise offer Chili Tuesdys where you make chili in the crock pot in the office kitchen and everyone chips in a few bucks to get some. more than pays for the ingredients.Office have an oven? Trays of enchiladas or what not are cheap in bulk.If you have four or five other people wanting to eat food you cook int he office you eat for free and they pay a reasonable cheaper than store bought price.IF you have  ordering out you still get free food.If none of these are options. Pick up menus from places that deliver. Order in at the office you organize. When someone is placing their order tell them you are adding  to cover taxes and delivery. You wont get much from that taxes and delivery often come to bout  but if you pay on the card no one will question where the few extra dollars go.The best side income I ever had was a job Im a contract laborer where there can be upwards of fifty to two thousand out of area workers on a project refinery chem plant etc. where I brought a vending machine into the plant and set it up to sell soda and shortly after another to sell snickers milkyway and butterfingers.The vending machines are expensive. roughly k Not only did I pay for them and all the items sold I made a good profit and then sold the machines when I was done for real cheap but needed to get rid of them.It cost me time. I eventually hired a girl who cleaned rooms at the hotel to go to the big store about forty minutes away and buy the pop and candy then load it onto my truck all while I slept.In the morning Id go into work just over an hour early stock the machines then go to work. Take my break late instead of  am with everyone else did it at . restock machines. Work through lunch and take my lunch at about  restock mostly empty machines while scarfing sandwich.when shift ends head back over to stock machines make a quick count of what I had left in truck i.e. stock of pop and candy then write list for girl.The hardest part was moving the money. I had to take time off several times or work odd shifts instead of ten or twelve hours straight work  hours with  off around  pm then six more hours I was awake before banks opened and when to bed after then closed.Worked a deal out with the manager of the hotel I was staying in to pay for the room in cash discount of about fifteen percent not sure if the room was vacant or not on the real list.I made a few thousand there when all was said and done because I had the capital to start and the will to do just a bit more get up early work though lunch stay late etc.The other contractors were more than happy to pay inflated prices for  cold drink or snack in a place that does not normally offer either.TLdr Look for ways to Save money by allowing others to pay for your stuff by you putting in little to no effort.

They fold flat to fit in the case but have a bit of movement in the other direction as well so they fit any head shape well. The top also has padding so they wont rub on the top of the head. Adjustment on the sides to fit head size was smooth but not loose so it doesnt feel like they will slip around when putting them on or taking them off.  They also arent too heavy so the weight is barely noticeable. Wore them for probably about  hours last night without issues.They are a little bit bulky about .. thickness on the sides so they may be a little uncomfortable sleeping with but for back sleepers or when sitting upright that probably wouldnt be a huge issue. Im mostly a sidesleeper so wearing them in sleep is out of the question for me anyways. The short cord may also interfere with sleeping with them on to some degree but since they use a full detachable aux cord longer cords can easily be picked up on the cheap from monoprice to replace the one that comes with them.Here is how I set the EQ up on them through software to suit my tastes but this is mostly subjective. Im a bit picky about sounds but had no issues after tweaking them. I didnt notice much of a difference in sound quality with NC on or off. Previous reviews I found when Aldi last had them all I could find was from Australia said there may be some variance when NC is cut on but I didnt find that to be the case.

Today this street looks like Dresden in  an empty wasteland of parking lots and lowvalue partiallyabandoned buildings. But in  this place rocked. Look at it! Look at those buildings  wed give anything to have that here today.gt Now ask yourself how this existed in the first place. How did we build such an amazing place before the home mortgage interest deduction? How did we accomplish this before zoning? Before the International Building Code? What created this place before we had state and federal subsidies of local water and sewer systems? Before HUD? Before DOT? Before the state highway system? Before Fannie and Freddie and subprime mortgages and collateralized debt obligations? How did we ever accomplish this before tax abatement tax increment financing SBA and local economic development? Heck we did this before the advent of the year mortgage!gt Heres the answer and the key to the correction we need to make We built places that financially sustained themselves. Do you know how I know this? Simple. If this place did not financially sustain itself it would have gone away. In  nothing was going to artificially prop it up.gt This is not an antigovernment argument. In fact just the opposite. To pull off what my ancestors created  a successful town in the center of the deep woods of Minnesota  they had to have excellent government. Their future depended on it.gt They had to organize themselves and use their collective resources very wisely. I look at the pictures of the beautiful way in which they maintained our now decrepit parks the purposeful way in which they placed grand public buildings the way in which they regulated the public realm and it is clearly evident to my trained eye that these people understood how to wring every penny of value they could out of their built environment. They knew the art of placemaking.gt Today we have largely relegated this art to Disneyland and isolated parts of the fauxdowntowns we are trying to revive. We have the New Urbanists to thank for resurrecting the lost knowledge of placemaking much the same way engineers of the Renaissance recaptured the knowledge of the Roman bridges and aqueducts an understanding literally lost for centuries. The transition in our understanding has been no less dramatic.gt So theres the primary supporting strategy placemaking. We need to wring more value out of our places and that is only going to happen if we understand how to create value in the first place. This is a monumental task because for two generations we have built our places without bothering to consider how they would be sustained or whether they would even be worth sustaining. None of our public officials has ever asked the question Will this public project generate enough tax revenue to sustain its maintenance over multiple life cycles?

You seem to think that the abstraction stops at high level languages like python java javascript etc. The fundamental break between us is that I see much has been abstracted away all the way up so that untrained normal people can build something without needing to know python java javascript etc. And that is fine that we disagree.If it didnt exist in some kind of final form yesterday it does exist today and this computer based thing is not firmware what is it?,Frugal,cyp66iz,1,t5_2qhbe

Add that to the fact that all those  off  and percent off scratchcards were discontinued and the store got noticeably more expensive.

6171933,0,t3_4018fe,A billion years ago I owned an insurance agency.  Actually I inherited it from my folks when my dad got cancer.  Anyway my father had at some point signed up for some service that sends magazines to doctors offices and the like.  But it was for free!  It wasnt always the same magazines.  Sometimes it was Popular Mechanics which was cool along with Entertainment Weekly which just caused me to shake my head or US News amp World Report etc.  They would arrive at different times but like ever other day you were getting a magazine or two in the mail.  Hewe never paid a penny for the service.I think what they do is they buy up what isnt sold to retail markets drugstores bookstores etc. and what isnt subscribed and they just send it out to anyone who signs up for their service.Now I say he never paid a penny and I know I never did after he died and I took over the agency but he may have let them provide our address and other information to various publishers etc.  In fact maybe THATs how it works worked?... maybe the service collects addresses of people willing to receive magazines and then lets the service send trial copies.

6362994,0,t3_42svct,I am actually going to Vegas this weekend leaving Fri after work returning Monday night and its costing me pp  people for flight from ORD rental car including insurance excluding gas and hotel.Flight  So lets break it down  where do you live and how will you be getting to Vegas? If flying consider Spirit or Frontier and wait for a sale. You typically never bring more than a backpack worth of stuff for a weekend in Vegas anyway so bag fees dont matter. Typically Sunday night through Thursday morning are the cheapest arrival times. Thursday nightFriday is cheapest departure time. Early mornings  late nights are typically cheaper than midday too. For my trip  the flight portion is pp RT arriving  PM on Friday departing  PM on Monday. Just check FrontierSpirit religiously daily and try to be flexible. Hotel  Forget the strip. And you dont necessarily want to stay in the residential areas too especially on such a short trip waste all your time going back and forth. The best hotel deal running these days is El Cortez. They have the lowest resort fee day vs day at the strip hotels and room rates are cheap too if you stay  nights. Its walking distance from Fremont Street the rooms in the Tower are nice and the casino is serviceable in a pinch honestly  just go to Golden Nugget.  Free parking for hotel guests. I booked as a bundle with the car  total   people  room  nights  car for  days.Rental Car  The last time I rented in Vegas I went with Sixt they are a block away from the airport rental car place and they were way cheaper than anything at the airport. This time around I booked as a bundle with the hotel via Hotwire as it worked out cheaper  from Dollar economy car. And yes a car is totally worth it  not only does it save you cab tofrom airport it saves you buscab to get to the strip from El Cortez it also affords you the option to eat off the strip. Speaking of cheap and not far away eats  there is some ramen places in chinatown for about bowl and Mr.Mamas for breakfast. Thats way cheaper than anything youll find at the resorts. Maybe the fine folks at rLasVegas can point you at a few others.,Frugal,czcwhce,3,t5_2qhbe

It was a physical activity that allowed me to mull over thoughts and created a sense of accomplishment once it was finished.

6450395,0,t3_43wzqg,so ive been couponing for about three years now and ive kinda stopped since im hoarding stuff just because its free. But anyways my advice for you Start at one grocery store and one drug store CVS Rite Aid Walgreens Read their coupon policy and memorize it. For example CVS will allow you to use two coupons on a BOGO item. Harris Teeter allows you to do the same thing Rite aid does not. So make sure you know the policy by the back of your hand. Or carry the coupon policy with you every time you shop.   you need to get at least two sunday paper that comes with coupons. Four is optimal but two should be ok start. Just because you have a coupon doesnt mean you should buy it or its a good deal. You will eventually figure things go on sale at around six week cycles. So buy enough to last you six weeks.  Buy things with coupon  sale  store coupon is your best way to lower your cost. So Coupon  store sale  some store will allow you to combine store coupon with regular manufacture coupon.  Some store will do overage some wont. So if the item was . and you have  coupon some store will give you the  cent to go towards your bill or some stores adjust your coupon down to . You need to have at least two computer and a laser printer laser printer are cheaper then ink printer and can print more you just need black and white DO NOT PHOTOCOPY COUPONS!!!! DO NOT BUY COUPONS FROM THE INTERNET watch the expiration dates Dont cut every single coupon from the booklet. Dont cut the coupon until you need it. Because sites will often say  Coupon is in SS . IF you already cut the coupon then you are gonna have a harder time finding the coupon  Learn the acronyms that we use like BOGO YMMV SS RP etc  If you have a CVS i would suggest you start with CVS. CVS is best place to coupon. You need to sign up for loyalty card.  My favorite websites are krazycouponlady and southernsavers  use southernsavers coupon database to find coupons if you need to buy items  You will find out what prices you are willing to pay for things. For example i never pay more then  cent for toothpaste or shampoo conditioner or tooth brush. I will never pay more then  fore a bottle of head amp shoulders. You will find your price point. Stock up when item turns out to be free.  If you shop at CVS or Rite Aid roll your reward bucks. For example your first trip can be like buy  worth of toothpaste get  back. So you pay   whatever coupon you used so let say your total is  with coupon. So you get back  for your next purchase. Next purchase  buy something that says buy  get  back. So you buy the item that equals to  use your coupons  the  you got back from your first trip pay whatever amount and get another  back. But thats how your roll your reward dollars to keep your OOP low. when rolling reward bucks split up your transactions so you dont end up paying  and getting back  in reward bucks. Because you wont use the  all at once.Good luck and let me know if you have any other questions! Too lazy to figure out why it didnt format correctly. ,Frugal,czmifha,4,t5_2qhbe

6506103,0,t3_434ug2,You must know of some cheap places to eat around your home and work. Fast food places small diners grocery stores etc. that are within walking distance. One thing that might be helpful is to budget out what you want to spend on food for the day in cash into small envelopes. So each day you grab an envelope with  and get to spend that on your food for the day whatever you want. So maybe twice a day you walk  minutes to go get some food or drive if your town isnt walkable. You can only spend the  so that is probably a couple of meals of fast food or from the store. Maybe you get an English muffin sandwich or a burger or if youre really hungry buy cans of black beans corn and salsa to make a Mexicanstyle dish. I suggest this method because the envelope method is really great for monthly budgets and Im sure it can work for daily food budgets too. Also if you dont have the food at home it is a lot harder to overeat. If this was my food plan for the month I would keep a few light foods things that are hard to overeat at home. Probably a bag of fresh fruit carrot sticks and hummus every week.

6809690,0,t3_48wf2u,For tomatoes and most fruit and veg it depends on how long it goes from being picked to being prepared.  Vitamins and flavor break down as an item ages.  Freezing or Canning preserves those things.  So if you can get fresh local tomatoes that ripened on the vine they are worth the expense BUT if you are buying the average grocery store tomato that was picked green and shipped from hundreds of miles away go with canned.Fresh basil that you grew is best in most cases.  Sometimes you need dried spices to stand up to some cooking methods.  If you are like me and cant grow any plants without killing them or my cats killing them then dried is OK.  To make dried spices tastier for like a quick spaghetti sauce I will take a little of the hot pasta water and steep my dry spices just like you would tea.  It hydrates the spices and brings out the natural oils.  ,Frugal,d0o6bd8,1,t5_2qhbe

Subarus hold their value really well.  It has been MY PERSONAL OBSERVATION that Honda interiors dont hold up well at all especially in heat here in FL.  Maybe a leather interior would hold up well but every single Honda with a cloth interior that any friend or family member of mine has ever owned has had problems with door panel fabrics headrest fabric and seat fabric that fades splits at the seams or delaminates from the doors.Both makes are legendarily reliable.  Subarus are legendarily rugged.  Old Subarus are insanely easy to work on Ive had an XT as my daily driver for  years and also own an SVX.  Newer Subarus appear to be fairly easy to work on too Ive got a Tribeca thats not too old so Ive only had to replace the starter and a control arm.  Hondas are supposed to be easy to work on but personally Im not a fan of a transverse mounted engine... Subaru engines are really easy to work around  you can reach just about every thing you could need to work on very easily.One factor to consider is the cost of tires.  An AWD car needs all four tires replaced at the same time unless youre talking about a minimal amount of treadwear on a tire that needs to be replaced and they really ought to be the same brandmodel tire.With the Accord you could replace a tire at a time if you needed to.,Frugal,d2emcr0,2,t5_2qhbe

7394016,0,t3_4gkok0,TLDR Financing is not a huge waste of money. Car loan interest rates are pretty low. Everyone says to get a loan through your bank instead of financing through the dealer but Ive done financing through the dealer twice and it was fine both times. They just use your credit info to find a bank for you. Its kinda like they shop around for the best rates so you dont have to. I got  interest rates both times at credit unions Id never heard of. I think thats pretty good considering I didnt have to do any work. That being said if you do buy through a dealer MAKE SURE the financesalespeople are not trying to sell you on what your monthly payment will be. You need to negotiate the total price of the car including fees first and then when you go for financing you need to talk about interest rates. Some salespeople will try to make you ignore the total price of the car by putting it in terms of monthly payments. This is because the longer the finance period the lower your monthly payments will be and that way they can make the purchase price of the car higher without you noticing. ,Frugal,d2infn5,4,t5_2qhbe

They didnt have a suitable preassembled line in stock so I asked an autozoner to borrow their brake flare tool. He came back with a tubing cutter I told him I already had one and needed the flaring tool.  He told me I could use the reamer on the back of the cutter to flare the line. I asked to speak to his manager. The manager claimed he didnt have a flaring tool available.  So I grabbed two shorter lines one with the proper fitting for the center Tee on my rear axle the other with the proper fitting for the slave cylinder and asked for an adapter to connect them.  He managed to find one that each line screwed into... but it was for compression fittings not flared. When I pointed this out and requested the right part... he brought back ferules suggested I cut the flares off and use the compression adapter. After face palming and realizing that if I left Id have to walk  miles to the next closest auto parts store  I asked him if I could look through the bins myself.

Keep in mind a lot of these people are older and stuck in the days that brand names actually meant quality or younger people that dont seem to want to understand more about their medication. Yes a lot of generics are manufactured overseas. Yes they have different fillers and if you were intolerant to a particular ingredient for example lactose or gluten you would find a brand that has none in it. Personally I like brands generic or not that are made in my country because I know that the company are employing my fellow Australians. However the active ingredients remain the same. Generics are cheaper for you they are cheaper for the store so they receive more profit and in independent pharmacies or small stores that would make a world of difference and on our healthcare system well for Australia.

First i was thinking its just because its very costly in install ac comparing to their wages and fans are just cheaper. But later i understood that ceiling fans have few massive upsides. . Temperature is the same as outside but constant breeze from ceiling pulls temperature away from you so it doesnt feel so hot. You can open your windows too for fresh air.. After stepping outside of you ac room its quite a big difference in temperature. But in case of fans the temperature is the same only thing changed is that breeze. If theres some wind outside then theres no difference. Less stress for your body.. You can turn on fan in room that you are currently in so no need to chill whole house less power consumption.. While i havent paid attention to power consumption of ac i guess fans are a magnitude less hungry than ac. Ceiling fan would be w tops.

Im not sure how frugal this options is particularly because as many people have pointed out you can get a mattress for quite cheap and I spent that or more on my hammock. What attracted me to it however was its much easier to put up and take down much easier to move much lower maintenance and just kinda cooler. I bought about  of hardware from my local hardware store and just drilled points in my houses wall studs. Couldnt be easier.One thing I think you are confused about is just how large a nice hammock will be. The woven mayan style hammock I got was ft long. Its large for my  frame but not crazy so.

Sams has slightly better prices but Costcos products seem slightly better. I have had BJs in the past and both Sams and Costco are much better than BJs. BJs is the pits.Here are some random thoughts on Sams vs. CostcoProduce  Advantage Costco  the selection and quality are much better.Meat  Advantage Sams  quality at both stores seem very similar. I am very picky about my meat and I like both. The quality in Sams is not like what you find in Walmart it is FAR superior. Both stores have good prices but the prices at Sams are better than Costco.In store Bakery  advantage Sams  They seem to have a larger selection and it all is pretty good.Commercial Bakery  advantage Costco  Costco seems to have some good contracts with bread makers. They have a large selection at about half of supermarket prices. Sams just has a couple of items.Milk and eggs  tie  both stores seem to have nice prices on these itemsGeneral grocery  advantage Costco  honestly this is one of the areas that Costco shines in. They seem to stock a higherend product at a good price. For instance pasta at both stores are the same price but at Costco you get Barilla. Costco stocks tanno style tuna acceptable olive oil still get it somewhere else I really like the Kirkland items. etc. Coffee  advantage Costco  I separated this out from grocery just because there is a distinct difference between the  clubs. I am not a coffee snob but I like a good cup of coffee. In my opinion there is nothing drinkable at Sams but there are a few acceptable items at Costco. The price cannot be beat.Personal care items advantage Sams  actually there is no competition here. Sams has a good selection at decent prices. Costcos selection well just sucks. Cheese  advantage Costco  Sams has a couple of good cheeses and probably has better prices on them... BUT Costco has a much better selection and still maintains decent prices.Awesome Rotisserie Chicken  tie  They are both equally giant and good. The only complaint is that the Sams by me doesnt seem to every make enough and I have never seen all of the rotisseries running. clothes  advantage Costco  no competition here. They often have nice things at Costco seldom at Sams. Also the dept at sams is always a giant mess but they have people full time folding in Costco.Hot dog special  advantage Sams  At Sams you get a Coke instead of a Pepsi. oz drink instead of oz Nathans hotdog instead of Kirkland.... The hotdog comes on a better roll at Costco. Costco offers a Deli mustard which is much better than the yellow stuff Sams has. Sams has free sauerkraut available. Beer  no winner this seems to vary a from location to location. The Sams by me has a nice beer selection but the one by my parents home has nothing. Costco is the opposite here crap by folks pretty good selection,Frugal,d4lod36,14,t5_2qhbe

8084186,0,t1_d4nqsj1,Thanks for such a thoughtful response sounds like you have a wonderful garden. A few things. Vegetable farming is crazy labor intensive and thus expensive as compared to raising animals or grains so a lot of us specifically seek out areas like yours where there is a concentrated populous of people who can afford to buy their produce. The catch  on that is that rural land is way cheaper but theres not a lot of people buying veg or a lot of people in general while land near populated areas is obviously more expensive but theres a market there. So thats some food for thought not that the food is necessarily marked up just costs more to make. Your three hour comment is interesting it makes me wonder where youre living because in a lot of America  hours isnt too long of a drive here in Kentucky I know a couple farms who drive  hours to market hell I used to commute an hour to work each day and I would certainly consider them local but thats just my perspective. Your strawberry question is an interesting one without knowing the specifics its hard to answer but its likely that farmers at the farmers market are not using migrant labor paid literal pennies a pound to harvest although its totally possible and there are of course shady operators. This is the importance of the farmers market they offer you an opportunity to actually meet and question the people who produce your food. The organic certification only regulates what you farm with not how you farm many large organic farms function on the same framework as a conventional farm they just use more of less effective pesticides same labor practices same tillage practices same pest practices. Theres no way to know unless you actually talk to the farmer or see the farm. So thats probably why your supermarket strawberries cost so much less un or inadequately paid labor. Americans historically are not used to paying their agricultural labor see slavery and its only been a short period of time where weve tried to do it some of us at least so I understand why the true cost of food comes with some sticker shock. Interesting remark about the corn Im personally happy to eat day old corn but I eat a lot of stuff destined for the compost bin so   Farm stand will win over farmers market for fresh corn any day fo sho.Bringing me to roadside stands. Sometimes in the country hobby producers will be farming as a side job which is awesome but they often forget to pay themselves when setting the prices. Its their choice but its not reflective of the actual value of their time and crops and can serve to bolster the greedy farmer argument if those old folks can do a quarter an ear whats this upstart at the market doing selling his for  cents??I really see it coming back to paying farm workers a living wage.

But a decent pair of plain leggings will be costing you probably as much as hose is per pair anyway. It just basically depends on what you can get away with. Ive seen quite a few sets of leggings that look like tightshose and will actually last.,Frugal,d4s08fp,1,t5_2qhbe

8122409,0,t3_4qeh0n,I assume you mean a government plan through Obama care but if you will be unemployed on paper I highly recommend applying for state health care. In my state it is based on your income. If you receive no income you pay nothing at all for your benefits. Its partitioned out for  months so you can apply get it and pay your  cost even if you get a job.I have never had a fully paid for employer health plan. The least Ive paid is  a month. To have all  of my family members me  spouse  child it cost me  a month. I know for sure because I was just laid off and the cobra payment is  lol! Were all going on my husbands employer health plan which is much worse than mine was and it will cost  a month but for just him it was . The reason his is worse is because theres a  deductible for any significant medical care though doctors visits and prescriptions are exempt. Our boy has a club foot and new shoes cost .

8148370,0,t1_d4vwobk,Hey there!Regarding the depressionanxiety that is something they will ask you in the health questionnaire and the mental health exam but I wouldnt necessarily say youd be ruled out. Heres how the process went when I first started donating I had to fill out a lot of paperwork going through my past and current health and also my familys health background on both sides.  After I filled out the paperwork they let me know that I qualified as a candidate but I had to wait three months to start because I had just taken the Deposhot a few weeks prior. The next thing I had to do is come in for a short physicalgyno exam blood work and a oneonone interview to determine my mental health. The doctor did ask if Id had any past experience with depression anxiety suicidal thoughts etc. but in my opinion the questions werent too invasive.  Once I was cleared I started the process. At first I came in every few days for blood work and its basically just so they know that youre not taking any drugs or smoking. Then I started taking the hormonal injections every day I found the best way to inject them was on the excess skin near my tummy. It hurt at first but after a few times I got used to being able to give myself the injection. Taking the injections usually lasted a couple of weeks and the closer towards the retrieval date when they take the eggs I had to go in for blood work more often and then they did a final gyno exam just to see how many eggs they could retrieve. The surgery itself wasnt that bad. They put me under and the surgery lasted for about  minutes. Then I got wheeled into a recovery room given tons of snacks and a check for  out the door. They recommended that I take the day off work and no driving for the day. I had some cramping for a couple of days afterwards but it wasnt anything some aspirin didnt cure. One thing to keep in mind is that your experience may vary depending on the agency. The place I went to was local and run by the city so I got paid  whether I got picked by a family or just had my eggs frozen for people to use later on. Other agencies will differ. Some larger and national agencies will pay you more but will require you to travel to the city where the surgery will take place and stay for several days travel and lodging costs are typically covered from what I hear. They may also have you sit down with lawyers to cover the legality of the egg donation again just from what Ive heard. Another thing to keep in mind is that this money will be taxed so keeping a small amount from the total you receive is a good idea if you can. The good news is that if you maintain your eligibility you can donate multiple times. The clinic I went to had a limit of  times throughout a donors life that they can donate but that might vary depending on the agency.Also they will have to decide whether you want to remain anonymous once the child turns . Sometimes once a child turns  they may decide they want to find out who donated the eggs to their parents. You can choose whether youd like that information to be given out to the child if they request it or if youd like your file to be completely sealed.I donated a total of five times and I while it took time and planning and small but temporary sacrifices giving up sex during the process kinda sucked I never regretted the experience. The first time I donated I received a really beautiful hand written card from the family and a gift card to a really nice restaurant in my city because they appreciated what Id done. Honestly Id be lying if I said I did it purely out of the goodness of my heartI was a struggling college student so Id be still a wonderful feeling knowing that Id been able to help them in that way.If you have any other questions let me know! ,Frugal,d4w3did,5,t5_2qhbe

I have since had two of my coworkers start doing the same thing with me.Honestly the food isnt too bad but I only do it two or three times a week. Two years ago there were very few options and now you can get almost anything in the park. Hell even Cold Stone is free but I try to go there sparingly. Feel free to AMA.Edit Also the best time to buy is the Flash Sale during Labor Day weekend. The gold pass is only like  plus  for the dining pass. If youre like me then you already have one and the new pass is good for the rest of the year plus the entire next year so theres a  month overlap where you have  dining passes.

If your car had a lifetime warranty would you hesitate to take it back to the shop when the engine blew up after  years?edit For example Ive spent unreasonable amounts of money on products from a Canadian outdoor retailer called Arcteryx because they make amazing products that do what they say they do but also because when Arcteryx says they have a lifetime warranty they mean it. It makes me feel better for spending  on a jacket or pants because I know that aits going to be tough and bif its not tough theyll make sure to fix it. Their policy on actual lifetime warranties means Ive spent thousands with their company. On the off chance I send something back in  years to have a zipper replaced theyre still coming out ahead and I will continue to buy from them. Companies offering and honoring these kinds of warranties builds trust in their clients,Frugal,d5iyd8m,9,t5_2qhbe

8336919,0,t3_4sibch,Im similar. I find it easy to scrimp and save on small items but spend large amounts without a thought. What worked for me was Setting a figure to save each month. Set it as a percentage of your income. For example  Set up and automated transfer from your account to save that amount as soon as it you get paid. Depending on your bank this might be pay day it is for mine or you might want to delay it a day. Create a second account that you use to pay all of your bills. Bills go out at various times through the month but if they are all paid out of a special account you can feed the total amount of bill payments into that account as soon as you get paid.This means that the day you get paid a whole heap of cash suddenly disappears from your account. Youll be left with the actual amount that have available for discretionary spending that month. It will likely be far smaller than you expect it to be. Your job for the rest of the month is to avoid your checking account going into overdraft.For me this made my life simpler. Before I thought I had a lot more money available for things like electronics and luxuries. That fact that money was leaking slowly over the month out of my account hid this from me.Now I feel broke almost immediately. But Im building a lifeboat fund in the background without really trying.YMMV,Frugal,d5jo3rm,1,t5_2qhbe

8431182,0,t3_4v308c,By far the biggest thing I take issue with is people throwing money around in bars and clubs. Some just dont realize how much money you waste when you throw around that kind of money and go out several times a month or more in some cases. For reference Im talking about the people who do all of their drinking at these locales and are paying higher than average costs for the sake of this argument lets say .The math speaks for itself. Using the average price per drink I referenced earlier lets say person A gets  drinks at a barclub. Thats  total. Instead person B pregames at home first drinking the equivalent of  drinks and then walks to the same barclub where heshe buys  additional drink a seemingly reasonable scenario. On average the cost of making your own mixed drink at home is just  if the alcohol you purchased is moderately priced my rum of choice costs  before tax and the largest size available on the market since bigger is almost always better value didnt show the  math here but trust that I have done my own calculations to come up with this general figure. So thats  spent at home and  spent at the barclub for a total of . Thats a savings of  and thats including having a topoff drink at the bar. Now imagine how much that gap widens with each repeated scenario. You get the picture.I get it. You dont always have the opportunity or the time to pregame and sometimes its less than convenient to do so. Thats understandable. But what I really take issue with is that people pass off such unnecessary spending as necessary in order to have a good time or as a reward for their long hard week at work. Im not saying to stay inside when your friends want to go out for drinks because you dont want to spend any money. Thatd be silly and you have to be flexible enough in life to get the most out of it. But its frustrating when people equate planning and being conscientious about spending to being a stick in the mud who doesnt know how to have fun especially as you get older.

I do all my own cooking but have about  convenience meals per week when I am feeling too tiredlazy to cook mac and cheese box instant soup etc. For the most part I cook though. I usually cook dinners so that I have enough to have for lunch at work and possibly dinner again the next day as well  but I personally dont mind eating the same thing several days in a row. I would suggest a slow cooker. You dont need to invest in one with all the bells and whistles though you certainly can and that would be awesome. Mine was only like  bucks and is still going strong  years in. It would be a little small for a family but for me its just perfect I can do a roast or a whole chicken in there with vegetables no problem. Its so nice to set it and forget it. I often load it up before I go to bed let it cook on low all night pack up some of the deliciousness for lunch then turn it to keep warm while Im at work. When I come home dinner is still warm and waiting for me. All in all I budget about month for food. I rarely like a few times a year go to restaurants though and only pick up fast foodorder a pizza maybe twice a month at most. When I do get fast foodpizza I subtract it from my grocery budget. The notion of having less to spend on actual groceries usually dissuades me from making too many afterwork McNugget stops. edit I also think up a loose meal plan and physically write out my grocery list before I go to the store. This really prevents me from overspending and making those impulse purchases. It also ensures that I dont forget anything and have to go running out to the store again which I used to do all the time! Im quite scatterbrained. ,Frugal,d60djhc,1,t5_2qhbe
8471063,0,t3_4va1qa,My wife and I slept on cheap futons years back. Both of the ones we owned were the WalmartTarget crappy ones. The first one broke about a year or so after purchase. The second one lasted about three or so years. I wouldnt advocate sleeping on one for long periods of time because they are terribly uncomfortable. That said cheap improvements we found were utilizing thick sheets and one of those cheap foam mattress pads. It really improved the comfort level of the futon. ,Frugal,d60f8sc,1,t5_2qhbe

Think about how many weddings funerals graduation banquets interviews etc you will attend in your life. Formal occasions are when people will most judge you based on your appearance. For business or networking a good suit reaps dividends. The most important step is a tailor. Thats the most costeffective method to look good. A tailor can really really change how your body looks with very minor adjustments. Suitsupply J Crew J Crew Factory and Brooks Brothers are good choices for less expensive but still good suits.

8504875,0,t1_d64m2fr,gt lly blew my budget for the month with a buy it for lifetype purchase which I got for a price I was totally happy with. So how should I feel? Its hard to know. My dad was good with money and one of the things he prided himself on was having a secure amount of cash on hand for his business. Reason being you might come across what is basically a fire sale on something you are looking for and if you have to go to the bank to get a loan or put it on a credit card you are going to potentially save a lot of money by paying cash. Also if you have cash and someone else has to go get credit you might be able to close the deal faster. Mind you this is when interest rates on loanslines of credits were higher and keeping cash in the bank was considered less of a moneylosing proposition.gt But I see people do these great videos of nospend months and having very strict budgets and while I admire it I feel like the stress would kill me. I dont know if I could handle not being able to stock up on something ifwhen I find It can be they dont have money to buy in bulk. I grew up extremely poor...we only ever had enough to buy like one or two four packs of toilet paper...but you would get a better deal on a huge costco sized pack and it would last longer but then we didnt have money for that...it would have come out of food or bills or something. You are always behind on something so each month is deciding which bill not to pay and which thing we can do without. You dont have money to even invest in bulk items that are cheaper in the long run. ,Frugal,d64nwld,8,t5_2qhbe

8659938,0,t3_4y5xgv,I have a big parrot and they are through no fault of their own inherently expensive pets to have. I have learned how to save money over the years. I steam clean his stuff VS buying expensive bird poop removerssanitizers. I also cheap out on toys. Store bought toys for a big bird like him can be  and last a week maybe before its all splinters on the floor. I buy him untreated xs at Home Depot and cut them into manageable pieces. I also give him baby toys I pick up at garage sales and thrift stores for pennies. Havent bought an actual parrot toy in a very long time. Dont know how long dog toys last but Im sure theres a cheaper option to the ones from the pet store. I save on food too though I do spend more time prepping itless convenient than commercial foods. He gets humangrade food appropriate for his species to eat fresh produce and bulk beans grains nuts seeds. I make up big batches every  months so he gets seasonal variety of all kinds of stuff and freeze in weekly portions. I spend about the same for  months of food doing that than I would for a month of high quality commercial parrot food and its healthier for him according to his vet. Perhaps you can consult your vet if there would be a cheaper and healthier way to feed your dog?I PORTION his meals too. His food dish is the size of a soup bowl and he weighs under a pound. No way he can possibly eat a full or even half full dish of food. People think Im mean when they see a small amount of food in a great big dish but in reality its a sensible portion for a creature his size. That is one thing Im pretty sure owners of all kinds of pets do waste food by offering way more than the pet can actually eat or the pet overeats and gets fat. If you havent already figure out how much your dog actually needs to get adequate nutritionmaintain a healthy weight and portion the food so almost all of a meal is eaten with little food waste. The  things I do notwill not skimp on The vet. He sees a specialist avian vet which is ungodly expensive but its worth every penny as a normal vet wouldnt readily spot health concerns a parrot might have at an annual checkup. A good vet is ALWAYS worth the money. Other thing is his area which takes up a good chunk of living room real estate and the furnishings werent cheap either. He has a great big tree to climb in various swings and ropes hanging from the ceiling to climb on and a gigantic cage even though he only locked up in the cage at night free all day. I could never bring myself to lock him up in some tiny discount cage. Animals need room to move play explore and its your duty as a pet owner to provide them ample room. Im not a dog person but if I had dogs I would not ever consider not having a yard for them. Dogs if thats the pet you have chosen NEED space and need to be outside more than a couple brief walks a day. ,Frugal,d6o3wqz,1,t5_2qhbe

At hour for something thats relatively easy its generally worth doing for an average person.Then look at a wealthier person. That person might decide to live in a k house instead of a k house because its looks a little nicer.

8755860,0,t1_d701n5h,You would probably fare better if you asked some more pointed questions rather than asking people to plan your spending for you. Im not sure exactly what youre looking for too general but here are a few places to start. Caveat Im Canadian but live in Nova Scotia so I can give you general tips but not necessarily Ontariospecific ones. Youll notice that cell phone and internet services are absurdly expensive in Canada. The market is predominantly occupied by three main companies who engage in what is just shy of collusion and the impotent regulatory agency the CRTC doesnt do much to protect consumers. It would probably be even worse without it but we still have some of the highest prices in the world especially for cell phones. Start by looking into cheaper providers. Since youll be in the GTA so check out Wind. It works with city zones so check their coverage and if you spend most of the time in the GTA Wind zone youll be fine. If you go outside the zone youll pay roaming. Another cheap and fully nationwide no zones cell phone provider is Public Mobile. I use them and have no complaints. Stay away from Bell Rogers and Telus.For internet look up local ISPs. Perhaps Teksavvy in Ontario? I use a local one here and get  MBPS down which is fine for my purposes and its about half the price of what big companies like Bell charge. For food check out No Frills and ethnic markets in the city. Ontario probably has some other grocery store chains that we dont have in NS so Ill be less helpful in that sense. Check Craigslist and Kijiji for used goods. Get a bike.Let me know if you have any specific questions.,Frugal,d7052pd,3,t5_2qhbe

Take a picture of it when you get a new one Also most vision plans cover yearly exams in my experience. Its also possible that glasses prescriptions are two years and contacts are considered a luxury and thus not covered yearly.

After living together for five years getting married wasnt a big deal to us but it was to our families. We especially wanted to model a positive relationship for a large number of niecesnephews whose parents were divorced or whose fathers werent in the picture and the like. We planned the entire event so that family and friends could attend at the lowest possible cost and get a vacation weekend out of the trip we lived about  miles from both families so we went back to them to get married. Ultimately it was important to us to have the opportunity to stand in front of everyone and declare our love for one another but looking back I still think it was really more for everyone else than for us.,Frugal,d7lzeak,5,t5_2qhbe

Fee  may not seem unreasonable however you will notice that the expenses they claim for the fund is exorbitant.  They basically wine and dine with investor funds and claim as expense then to put salt on the wound they take cut of their fees as well.

9144050,0,t3_55ie2b,Buy kidney beans chickpeas lentils split or whole in bulk in dried form and not canned. Their shelf life is extremely long probably years. Invest in a pressure cooker although this is more for time saving and is not a necessity. Soak the beans or lentils overnight in water. Cook them in a pressure cooker and it will hardly take  mins to cook. Stovetop will be  times longer.Better still wet the beans or lentils or peas after soaking them overnight and leave them in their bowl not waterlogged just damp with a thin cloth for cover or a lid with holes let the beans breathe. Leave them for  days. Make them damp if you notice they are dry sprinkle some more water.You will end up with sprouted beans or peas or whole lentils. You could even do different types at the same time.Sprouting converts the carbs in beans into protein so is significantly better than the unsprouted version and you get this benefit for literally free. Sprouting also softens up the beans and when well sprouted you can eat them raw or only need to minimally cook them.Edit You can also use dried black eyed peas and dried green peas. Indian stores usually have the best variety of dried peas lentils several kind and beans. ,Frugal,d8b2nxc,8,t5_2qhbe

Confirmation bias is the term for this although the term applies to many types of bias and associated effects. I of course have my own biases. But Ive been in both scenarios which helps.I have been poor. I grew up in a single parent household with my sister. We received food baskets at Christmas. Our mom worked three jobs at one point and we had some terrible landlords along the way. Ive had bad landlords myself as well as some okay landlords with weird quirks and issues. Im not disagreeing with the idea of protecting yourself. Youre definitely completely right in that regard. And Im not disagreeing with it being expensive to be poor either as a general statement that is very true.

Anyway one day I decided I was going to use up all the food I had stocked up and started making menus based on the inventory.  I did not have to shop for two weeks and lived off what I had.

I also dont window shop  used to work retail so I have burned myself out in terms of just wandering aimlessly around malls  and Im fairly small so I dont have to worry about clothing in the sense that very few people my age are my size. I also bought a lot of high quality items when I was younger and worked for designer companies many of which are  years old or more and still  in style  because the exact same items are still being made.One thing I can recommend is to spend the money on the staples  shoes coats purses bags  and ignore the frivolous items  ex a  tank top wont last you much longer than a  one. I also take pristine care of my things. My clothing doesnt go on the floor I hand wash all of my delicates and I steam my clothing rather than using an iron to avoid potential burning.I just take care of my things in general. I dont chuck things about or mistreat them. I learned basic sewing skills when I was younger. The last thing that was damaged was unfortunately because my grandmother had washed it but she doesnt know cashmere from cotton so my cashmere sweater ended up in the washer dryer. Lesson learned dont let grandma have any access to your clothes. Shell scrub the life out of it.Just look for fit and form. Buy things while keeping what you already own in mind. When in doubt go neutral. Oh and be kind to your things! A little hand washing and a  delicates  setting can go a long way.,Frugal,da02wvk,3,t5_2qhbe

Buy your kitchen stuff early and it will prevent you from overspending on food.For pots and pans you need only a stockpot a saute pan or saucepan and a skillet. Get stainless steel. You can cheap out on the stockpot but get a nicer skillet. Avoid plastic handles nonstick etc. You could pick these up second hand but people dont really get rid of decently made stainless cookware because it is durable. You also might want a loaf pan or two and a casserole dish if you like doing roasts or casseroles. Other than that you need a kitchen knife buy new a pairing knife if you do not have a suitable pocket knife a mixing bowl and a cutting board buy new cheapest option. Then you need the kitchen gadgets only three of these are legitimate the box grater the can opener and the vegetable peeler. Your can opener should be quality search for made in the usa can opener on amazon the top result is the american made swingaway opener since swingaway sold its name to a Chinese company. Cheaper openers are disposable because they dull. The box grater cutting board and mixing bowl can be from the dollar store. I also recommend dollar store plastic food containers to prevent you from throwing away food. If a family member or friend insists on buying you a microwave ask them to buy you a slow cooker instead.

My motherinlaw literally sat at my dining room table with snot running out of her nose dripping onto the wood below she refused to blow her nose until we gave in because we said that we didnt want to invite the parents of a friend she had in high school. So I had to eventually cut almost my whole family from the guest list. The meat and alcohol thing was the only part of our wedding plan that we got to keep. We hated our wedding the only positive thing I can say about it is that at least no one vomited on me and I didnt have to pay for animals to be slaughtered. ,Frugal,dbez8zs,2,t5_2qhbe

If youre conscientious about making sure you compare apples to apples mounting styleweight metal type stone sizes and quality not too many variables on moissanite so thats easy etc. you should quickly figure out who wants your business the most. There are a few main suppliers for these types of things unless youre doing something very unusual so odds are good several different stores will quote you the same items just with a different amount of profit built in. In my experience you CAN get the best price from an independent no corporate office setting a minimum profit margin but some independents prefer their air of special so much they wont move on prices.

This includes paper products personal care and sometimes even a  bag of cat food if I dont feel like buying it separately. Ill admit though that I use coupons.However whats worked out really well for us is this I dont just say okay I have a  budget for the week. Nope. Every paycheck he withdraws  that he passes off onto me that goes in a second cash compartment in my wallet. So if I spend  one week and  the next I still have  leftover from the grocery budget... and I dont touch it.

10356965,0,t3_5nl2t5,I sell old cars and am familiar with your type of car. Buy some used tires from a rinky dinky shop. Only do the timing belt if you need the car to last  years. If you are planning to get a new car in that time frame it wouldnt be cost efficient to replace it. Cant advise you on the distributor or engine leaking oil as I didnt see it but keep in mind most cars this age are burning and leaking oil to some small extents. Monitoring your oil levels when the car is cold and making sure to add in some oil if you get low between oil changes can easily keep your old car running without having to shell out for a repair. Keep in mind operating the car with too much or too little oil can seize the motor and make the car worthless otherwise as long as the motor has a proper amount of oil in it it should keep doing its thing. Some of the belts you can look at yourself but I probably wouldnt fix anything until it literally broke. Keep in mind a timing belt breaking while you are driving will most likely bend your valves and require an engine rebuild which is not cost effective to repair at that point. This is why I mentioned the  year thing above. Good luck and keep in mind that I see these cars with  and  hundred thousand miles several times every year.,Frugal,dci0tcz,2,t5_2qhbe

Which limits your options.Even that big tractor you bought or now your modern day cars gadgets etc. You own the rights to use them but not the hardware. And for some when you stop paying you stop being able to use it . I.e. satellite radio.Then there is the monthly cycle of renting everything. From internet service to phone service car insurance etc. You have a huge monthly expense you cant get rid of mostly including cable etc. There is rcordcutters and the like but for most people there is substantial cost going out the door each month with no way to get past it.Youve made a great step in looking for where you can make those changes. Some stations allow you to purchase gas in bulk at the beginning of the year and fill up as you please. go inside tell them  gallons and they take it from your pre paid tab. mom and pop shops mostly. likewise with a whole pig. You pay for it when its young piglet and some money as it grows per month for feed then get the grown pig butchered for a fee and free at the end of the cycle. This helps beginning farmers with costs cuts there profits down but allows them to raise more animals with less up front cash. Not only do you get cheap meat but you help out the local farmers. The above pig agreement but with vegetables from farmers market.

All the other crap on the box is just what makes it the color it is and the taste. Ultimately youre looking for that percentage.Important note higher percentage isnt actually always better.

10764388,0,t3_5tx0dl,My safety razor has lasted two thirds of a year and still feels sharp. Here was my strategyampnbsp. Buy some color indicating silica gel dessicant . Place a little dessicant in one canning jar mason jar and store your spare blades in there. Be sure to close it tight with one of the wax impregnated lids.. Put the majority of the dessicant in another canning jar and store your razor head in there. Be sure to dry it off before you store it to prolong dessicant life.ampnbspEvery year I plan to bake the dessicant in the oven its reusable and replace my blade. Both are going strong after eight months. I bought the fivebladed vibrating razor at Sams for like  IIRC and it came with five cartridges I think. That gets my annual shaving costs to about year not including shaving cream which probably takes it to year.ampnbspEdit Just to clarify its the moisture that ruins your blade corossion rather than the act of shaving itself. The standard safety razors are probably less expensive than my system but they irratate the heck out of my upper lip. The ridiculous five bladed vibrating razor combined with paying attention to what direction I shave and lanolin after shaving are the only things that keep my upper lip from becoming a splotchy irritated mess.,Frugal,ddq9m1o,1,t5_2qhbe

I recognize that Ill only get pictures of what someone did  too late to stop anything  but thats typically all you get from the paid systems anyway  unless your police station is next door.  The pictures are immediately automatically uploaded to the internet using a popular cloud file synchronizing system free account  not using more than the free allocation.  So even if they trash the security system the pictures are already uploaded.With Blue Iris you can also set triggers to alert you by emailsmsapp and watch live video from the cameras.  So once you are notified you can watch the perpetrators and hope the police show up in time The other thing I wanted was to do was to monitor the house systems while Im away.  Peace of mind.

In some stores the POG is less strictly observed than in others and its a veritable bloodbath behind the scenes between different grocery vendors such as myself. It creates a much more challenging scenario for the store too as vendors might reorder merchandise that no longer has a home in the shelf causing money to sit tied up in merchandise that is sitting out back not making money.TLDR if you start plugging holes where items have gone out of stock you begin a chaotic and costly precedent.Edit removed autocorrect gobbeldygook.,Frugal,delk6lb,15,t5_2qhbe

In our imaginary dialouge your response to me saying I wasnt sure and asking what you meant is just not how it would go down with  percent of people. They would elaborate what they meant and if the bank said that wasnt possible after determining exactly what he was asking for then you go get a new bank. Youre entirely missing the guys point and focusing on a  term that may or may not be used by his bank. If its just the word they arent familiar with then they would realize what he meant upon describing it and then proceed to help him.  If the service isnt available then he should leave because this is a very basic request that many people ask for and get regularly.

11141608,0,t3_5z10te,I agree with not going to retail stores when I dont absolutely need something. Shopping isnt entertainment for me which is a fairly new view!. When I do need something I will usually research it extensively before buying to ensure the money I am going to spend is going to be money well spent. I just did this with a blanket. I dont spend a lot of money but I also dont cheap out on purchases either. I prefer quality over quantity. I hem amp haw a lot when it comes to buying something especially when I know that I dont need it. VERY often that thing I had to have a week ago no longer seems as appealing when I reevaluate. I also tend to buy a lot of my household  personal toiletries using coupons. I am not usually fussy with brands or products  and I dont have any specific needs so I am very open to new products etc. Toothpaste mouthwash laundry detergents...I wind up paying very little and in a lot of cases the store pays me to take them. I have trigger stores  especially TJMaxx and HomeGoods. Online my trigger is eBay. I do use eBay a lot  I can often find things cheaper there and use sites like eBatesSwagbucks to get cashback. I often will sell something to offsetcover new purchases this also works for me because I live in a tiny studio apartment. I use Swagbucks and I use the money I earn there as my fun money sometimes. I average about  a month there so I usually save half and get a  gift card for a treat purchase every other month or so. This might sound silly but I record every purchase in a check register to keep tabs of my spending too. I am in graduate school so I have very little money. It might be extreme to some but it works for me right now. I almost never feel deprived. ,Frugal,deuw1w8,4,t5_2qhbe

11250992,0,t3_60ilkz,I havent built a container home myself but have long studied the concept as a possible solution for the ownerbuilder. Container housing can be a frugal option but its a hack that is very situational. The cost varies greatly depending on the design approach the location and the local costs of metalworking. Its generally not cheap in the US because the transportation costs and metalworking costs are high. But in regions with large container gluts and cheap labor such things are potentially much cheaper and the use of containers for lowincome housing is not unusual. The biggest problem with using containers is that people chronically underestimate the work of their conversion and take on more than they can handle. Its not difficult to adapt a container into a comfortable home but people typically try make modifications that are high in expense. Cutting windows and doors in the sides of containers is a lot of work and joining them together sidebyside or linking them up in ways inconsistent with their standard modular topology is a real hassle. The most inexpensive way to work with containers is to make as little modification to them as possible working with their normal openings. Containers are themselves relatively cheap space. Its the modifications that make them expensive. I feel that ft hicube containers are more convenient than others because they are easier to transport position and their shorter length means their normal end openings can provide sufficient light especially if you can find ones with doors on both ends. If you think outside the box it is possible to make a comfortable home as a compound using several containers in a cluster as individual rooms. This is especially suited to warmer climates and not only reduces that compulsion to modify the containers it makes outfitting the interiors less complicated as you arent compelled to try and pack so many features into a limited space. Various accessories intended for industrial uses have potential for domestic repurposing. Many companies now make modular arch or pitched roof canopies designed to make paired containers into garages or barns plugging directly into their corner blocks. Large forms of these have been used to turn containers into shopping malls. In a warm wet climate its helpful to add a skybreak roof over the containers to provide shade and reduce the noise of rain. These container arch roofs could work well for this. Precast pier foundations pinpier foundations and steel helical pier foundations are well suited to containers and one company in Canada already makes helical piers specifically for use with containers. If one must put containers in joined combinations then the cheaper option is probably to work with the folddown container frames commonly used to build prefab housing. These frames will stack four in the space of one normal container for transport and are specifically designed to be joined together using a joint gasket and gap covers allowing them to be used to make buildings of any size. The usual container shelters based on these are very utilitarian and usually rather ugly. But used as bare box frames as a building block they can be finished in an endless variety of ways using moreorless conventional wall materials and siding. They work well with conventional wood SIPs structural insulated panels drainage plane wall cladding and commercial window framing systems. They will also work fine for roofed walkways and deck spaces. lanai Ive long predicted that these frames would soon evolve to  wide or even  square forms as a logical improvement on their housing uses but this hasnt happened yet. ,Frugal,df7a7qc,2,t5_2qhbe

These will only really remove highly visible contaminants dirt and bird poop. The brushes or those cloth noodles do nothing but smack your car around. Again they remove visible contaminants but think about the s of car contaminants that are left on those. These will scratch your car.Wheel washes is only good for loose contaminants.

11380002,0,t3_62be9v,Everyone has already said not to eat out and that is huge but another is simply to buy things out of need rather than want and learn to mend what you have rather than repalce. I bought a mini trampoline to jog on when the weather isnt great for walking. The trampoline cost  and a spring will break once in awhile or a tab will tear out. I bought a dozen replacement springs for  and have used only two so far in  years of use and I sew the torn tabs back on with fishing line that I picked up for less than . Chances are that the trampoline will last over a decade as long as I do little repairs myself and I get exercise without a gym even in poor weather and I dont waste money on a gym membership that I ignore when I get lazy.Most of what people blow money on is frivilous stuff that they are enchanted with in the moment and dont care about after a short time. You have to ask yourself if you really need or love something so much that it is worth the money. If you have cable TV or an expensive smart phone plan those are other things to look at. I dont own a TV set or have any subscription other than broadband internet because I dont need TV when I have YouTube or other video options online. My husband has a cell phone but his plan is only month for unlimited datacalls. I dont need a cell phone but we added a month landline at home. That is still cheaper than a second cell. YMMV according to your lifestyle however.Generally just really look at need. Sometimes you actually need something new even when the old item works because youre not happy with performance like replacing a PC which is old and slow and thats valid so Im not saying never buy a new thing when the old one works but really think about if youre looking for a shiny thing which will impress others or make you happy due to its newness but doesnt really bring much added function or utility to the picture. My husband and I have no debt and save a fair bit on a low income because of living by need rather than want. On an income of around k we saved about k in a year and that was with some dental and medical issues as well as a few small vacations with hotel stays and eating out once or twice a month not exactly the height of restraint.When we really want to replace something or need it we just buy in cash as we always have enough when we really decide to make those choices. ,Frugal,dflwk3b,2,t5_2qhbe

11396972,0,t3_62lomo,I have a theory. First of all ANY car can go well over  miles and you really dont even need to take care of it much... just repair it when it breaks and even a car that your teenager ran dry in oil or blew a head gasket will make it over k.Anyway my theory. My parents bought an outgoing model year Chevy Suburban in . Im guessing they paid around k which wasnt a small amount of money for them lets not talk about their poor money management skills at the moment Im not in the mood. The plan was ALWAYS to get a new Suburban in  years. The old Suburban started needing some significant repairs. A grand here a couple grand there.  years rolls around and my parents have NO money to replace it. Not only that they refuse to buy a lesser vehicle. They need the same package Suburban they had before x the whole shebang. And of course they will need the leather seats this time around. Come to find out that level Suburban is a k car. So they keep the old Suburban running because it costs less cash now they gave it to my sister and its still around. My point is whenever I see these huge behemoth SUVs rolling around that are more than  years old its almost always a poorer person behind the wheel. Theyll keep fixing it forever because they cant afford a nicer newer SUV and that might be because they drive around cars that get mpg. Most poor people are exceptionally good at making decisions that keep them poor.,Frugal,dfnty7r,0,t5_2qhbe

11712381,0,t3_672pua,The number of high paying jobs that are hourly wage is rather limited unless your definition of high paying isnt that high paying or you work for yourself.  And if you do work for yourself the number of hours you work in a week are usually not so elastic that you can simply choose to work an extra hour or two it is usually dictate by whether you have the work load to need to put in the extra hours.
