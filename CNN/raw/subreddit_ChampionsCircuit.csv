6207469,0,t3_40l4op,I find it strange that AAOB picked both Lulu and Morgana to form an effective protect the carry style comp but then went with Miss Fortune who isnt known for her hyper carry potential. It might have been better to pick Vayne Jinx or Trist. Though this is somewhat negated by having Vi on the other team which means you HAVE to save black shield for her ult.Just from team comps alone MM has superior pick potential and in my opinion also a better team fight unless Miss Fortune some how gets a perfect ultimate off.,ChampionsCircuit,cyv80se,3,t5_3aqx2
