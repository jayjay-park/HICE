3120520,0,t1_cold1c3,gtMy other point was that women as a group of soccer players would be better on average if more women played.I dont know how accurate this sentiment is. If we look at the NCAA records we see that an equivalent number of men and women play collegiate soccer in essence the pool is the same. In fact if were looking at the top collegiate athletes we see that there are  men playing in Division I soccer and that  women playing in Division I. The question is with this larger pool of numbers especially in the top division if women would improve athletically from a larger pool we could see it in the college game. We dont no matter how good the womens soccer team is I bet they would lose to any division collegiate mens soccer team. Furthermore unique to the world the United States has the most equality in soccer. Men and Women participate in soccer from childhood in similar rates. So in the US at least the pool to draw soccer candidates is roughly equal in theory. I dont think expanding the pool would improve the curve by much especially since the US is as good a case as any that you cant really expand that pool. ,WomensSoccer,colfvyp,1,t5_2sr4p

Here were very far behind in that regard Im pretty sure I can watch the NWSL youtube streams here in England I forgot to check the other night though!I reckon you might be able to find decent streams for the WSL games BT Sport are airing through cricfree. ,WomensSoccer,csu37af,3,t5_2sr4p

4667706,0,t1_ctis6nc,Thats precisely how it works? Players are shipped off to new teams without being told beforehand that there are talks and that theres the possibility they could be transfered and whether theyre happy with it? Are you sure because if thats how every trade goes down then its a severely fucked up system. To me it sounds like Carli was implying its only the Flash who operate that way.Just because they operated within the rules doesnt mean they showed her any respect over it which is what shes upset about.,WomensSoccer,ctix284,6,t5_2sr4p

6020554,0,t3_3xu7lm,Ignoring the head injury stuff here as not qualified to comment on that.A ban on heading in youth football would be a good thing and allows players to concentrate on foot work and ball control with the feet. Ball on the ground and pass and move is the fastest and most effective football.Yes there is a time and place for headers but you win more with the ball on the ground.  Get those fundamentals ingrained into young players and you will create fantastic players ,WomensSoccer,cy8thoo,2,t5_2sr4p
