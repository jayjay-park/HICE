7286844,0,t1_d25evsy,I believe the organizers are trying to put people together that can play around the same time typically evenings. I live in central time zone but find it difficult to have free time during the evening here but have time during the morning and afternoon. This correlates with evening in gmt land when most people can play. Typically other international leagues and season  of this use gmt as a standard time so that you can declare your availability to that. ,xwingonline,d26grd8,1,t5_337xv
