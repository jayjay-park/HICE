702461,0,t1_cgbtr9z,I know you posted this over a week ago but just wanted to chime in. I found my guy on www.petfinder.com along with three other basset hound rescues I never knew existed within  miles of my home. If youre seriously wanting to rescue one or another? pull up this site type in basset add your zip and wait for the magic to happen. Best thing I ever did was find my bubby!,bassethounds,cgk4f1w,2,t5_2ru5l

I got him when he was almost  and Im . sure his previous family made him live in the yard so unfortunately Im starting to think the instinct is engrained in his stubborn brain at this point. He loves other dogs though. Hes an old man now but he can play for hours with young dogs. ,bassethounds,dfpbpy2,1,t5_2ru5l
