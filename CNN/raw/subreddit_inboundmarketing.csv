2383665,0,t3_2mmikx,There are a few to choose from. HubSpot and Pardot are very competitive. There is also Eloqua and Marketo  not familiar with these at all. I only have experience with HubSpot but it works pretty well if you put in the time to learn and use it. Pardot does not offer a free trial  HS does  so I never even seriously considered it.,inboundmarketing,cm6buxq,3,t5_2sq0y
