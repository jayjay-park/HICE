208606,0,t1_cf24mpx,Wait what Im confused?! NonDesis wearing western clothing abroad arent treated badly because of it but Desis are treated badly for wearing their cultural clothing in the west be they visitors or residents. We are foreign un assimilated for wearing our clothes in the west but white people are cool and cultured for wearing our clothes. Im not a fan of threads like these because in the end it comes across to me as Im white please tell me theres some loophole that lets me wear your cultural garb?! PS I dont take no for an answer. But this is SRS so I have high hopes that wont happen. For now I am totally against cultural appropriation unless someone is invited to partake in another culture. ,SRSWomen,cf27c9w,15,t5_2tdoc
209207,0,t1_cf27z4o,About the first question I asked Yes Ill admit if I was seeing if there could be any concession but Im also willing to take a no and live with it. Obviously you are both uncomfortable with any form of appropriation and I can appreciate and respect thatIm not planning on making any of my own clothing or buying a salwar kameez after hearing from you. Thats why I started this thread. Obviously two people are not representative of an entire race but if the thought makes a couple individuals in a community I quite like this uncomfortable then I wont do it.As to the second question I asked it was aimed to start a more general discussion of appropriationwhen if ever is mixing in elements from other cultures into your wardrobe okay. I caused you both some discomfort and for that I apologize so Ill just end my part of in this thread.,SRSWomen,cf29t9g,4,t5_2tdoc

Maybe they mean youre much much more likely to notice your period for the first time by staining your underwear not by seeing blood in the shower?

370145,0,t1_cfgvvac,I know many women who didnt wear the hijab before migrating to the west but began to do so afterwards.  Its not about covering yourself its about making a cultural and national statement.  People have the right to wear what they want and express their culture and beliefs the way they want.  People always speak against the hijab but never speak against Jews wearing the Kippah or Sikhs wearing the Turban.  I have never met someone who wasnt so adamantly against the hijab that wasnt a racist they often go on to say other things like oh their culture is taking over or similar things.The whole hijab is oppressive is just a used cover for a racist argument because they dont like seeing elements of other cultures.  And yes I know Islam isnt a race but guess what its strongly linked to particular ethnic groups and cultures that are often minorities in western countries so antiMuslim sentiment is often no different to racism.  And I think youre antihijab statements in this case are just as racist whether you realise it or not.,SRSWomen,cfj4q2b,1,t5_2tdoc

2274111,0,t1_clsrnmh,Sexually abusing children IS the work of a few bad apples though. Society doesnt encourage people  let alone  yr olds  to sexually abuse  yr olds. Society pretty much unequivocally condemns this and discourages it. Maybe we can make an argument that reddit encourages child abuse but thankfully reddit is not society and reddit certainly didnt tell the  yr old Dunham that its okay to jerk off while holding your  yr old sister in bed.I think moving the focus away from Lena Dunham and blaming society for teaching her to diddle her  yr old sister is really reaching.

3027850,0,t3_2usr19,I dont have a good answer but I wanted to let you know youre not alone. Anything medical fills me with terror which is of course lovely when Im in need of medical treatment and the cure seems worse than the condition. Growing up my family wasnt very understanding and I felt like the only person in the world who was afraid of going to the doctor. I just wanted to say that you can do this you can go to the people who can make you better and youll be okay.I try to think of if this way Instead of thinking of it as going to a doctor or getting a procedure done I think of the doctors as removing my worries. After Im done at the doctor I dont have to feel that dread about going or the worry I feel while Im there. Theyll take my anxiety away and I wont feel it after I leave.

3288864,0,t3_2xsdae,A friend linked the article on FB and I was put off from the first paragraph because it was a heap of evopsych bollocks. All this balls about being hardwired to care for children is just gross. I mean yeah I dont disagree that there are certain patterns and tendencies but the whole this is what nature intended you to be and do thing is really damaging.Id say the point that emotion is natural and healthy is an important one to make especially considering people are vindicated for being too sensitivecrying all the time etc. But it is very strange to be gendering this message because its one thats very pertinent to how masculinity is policed. Emotion is okay is something that needs selling more to men than to women. Saying that emotion is just what women do is not helpful.And medically the article is hugely dodgy as well. You mention she doesnt distinguish normal emotions from genuine mental illness. Well according to diagnostic criteria what distinguishes a tendency or style from an actual disorder is if it causes significant impairment to a persons ability to function. So either she is only talking about those with only minor emotional issues in which case shes made no real point or she is saying even the women who experience that significant impairment and there are a lot of us should just put up with it because its natural which is a pretty horrifying stance.So yeah in short fuck that article.,SRSWomen,cp35nnm,14,t5_2tdoc

3586492,0,t1_cq0r3jd,Thats where my issue lies though. I believe that people who are transgender have the wrong body for their brain. So a trans woman in the most basic of terms has a female brain in a male body and thats where the problem lies with the body.If I could tell myself this was the case for me I would be happy. But my mind keeps telling me I have a males brain that Im just delusional that Im not even really trans. Its a really painful thought for me because I want more than anything to be a real valid woman. If I could believe that I had a female brain I would be so much happier and feel so validated. I dont want a males brain not because it would mean Im delusional but because it would mean I cant be female. Its really really painful. Its a lot to have to cope with on top of living life as a trans woman. But I keep pressing forward because more than anything I want to live as a woman look like a woman be referred to as a woman. More than anything I want to be a real woman. And if this is the best I can get in this life Ill take it. For me its a thousand times better than being a man. ,SRSWomen,cq136m6,5,t5_2tdoc
