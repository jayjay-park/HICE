1846443,0,t3_2fpulb,Youve got a good start. Do use an accurate digital thermometer. Keep doing what youre doing as far as the reverse portion of the fever sear method but get your skillet hotter than what it currently is. Use an oil with a higher smoke point than butter in the pan then spoon some melted butter on the steak while its searing. Finally when youre letting the steak rest cover it with foil and let sit for a good  minutes rather than the two minutes you gave it. This will allow the meat to reabsorb all that delicious juicy myoglobin. ,steak,ckboxco,2,t5_2qmha

3074916,0,t3_2vdn09,Everybody always says get your pan hot hot hot!.  Ive been curious lately what the upper limits of that hotness looks like....I found it. Tonight I took my big cast iron skillet outside and heated it directly over my big propane burner. It didnt take long before the skillet got so hot it actually started to turn an ashy grey color.  I reverse seared the steak in the oven to F then rested for a few minutes before the searing. I melted a few tablespoons of clarified butter over low heat in a smaller skillet then dipped the steak in and thoroughly coated it on all sides before chucking on the insanely hot skillet. The butter instantly ignited into flames. Despite the flames I managed to reach in and flip the steak every few seconds for a total of about  seconds. Obviously I got a good sear without effecting the interior but I would definitely say that was too hot. Obviously its major fire hazard and feel like its just too hectic trying to manage flipping the steak and not burn myself andor set my house on fire. I feel like theres a middle ground between my limited BTU indoor range and my propane burner set to breath of satan. Next time Ill dial it back a bit. ,steak,cogpofs,7,t5_2qmha

11018121,0,t1_defsa9i,Dont be too upset at your butcher as they are feeling the same pain you do actually! In the United States the USDA has since  facilitated a national service grading both yield and quality of beef carcasses. The latest grading instrument technology dates to   but it grades whole carcasses and whatever the carcass is graded as determines which USDA quality shield is applied to your steak at market in your case as a store shopper Select Choice or Prime. Your butcher doesnt have control over this and has to tell you which quality generally marbling with some consideration to maturity of the animal and overall characteristics the carcass was graded at. This is what determines the USDA shield you see affixed to the packaging or on the label in the cold case. Costco is another story though. They tend to buy lower Yield carcasses cheaper which can nevertheless be graded in terms of Quality either Choice or Prime. However sometimes a lower yield carcass just means a less attractive Choice or Prime as compared to a higher yield carcass. Costco also needleblade tenderizes which I dont love. ,steak,degvgc1,1,t5_2qmha
