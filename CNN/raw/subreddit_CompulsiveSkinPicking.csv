78721,0,t3_1uv732,I like the way you phrased that. It seems crazy that we struggle to keep ourselves from literally tearing our skin off but we all have that problem. Its good to know were not the only ones!Well in my opinion... you need your fingertips. We use our hands for so much and its probably best not to get blood all over the place depending on how bad your fingertip scabswounds are because that could be some serious medical risk to you and others. Not to mention I imagine that you pick at everything else USING your fingertips. So if your fingertips are open wounds or even around the nails you are automatically spreading all those germs and possible infections to the rest of your body. So fingertips to me seem like Priority . But for me personally I identify more with the facialchest acne picking so I understand why that can be even more of a challenge. Having a scarred face is really embarrassing and can keep you from participating or even GOING to schoolworksocial gettogethers. It keeps your from living life basically.I totally get it quitting cold turkey is hard. Sometimes impossible. Especially if you have more than one vice and youre trying to quit ALL of them at once. It just risks an exceptionally bad freakout binge if you fall off the wagon. And trust me I know. I have quite a few bad habits including overeatingnot exercising biting my nails and picking at my skin. Ive never been at a healthy weight with clear skin and unbitten nails all at the same time. I tend to focus on one problem at a time while my other two addictions get progressively worse. So I would suggest tackling the fingertip problem first. Maybe a little progress in one area will motivate you in others.  Keep at it! Were rooting for you ,CompulsiveSkinPicking,cene36w,2,t5_2tcjc

5648680,0,t3_3sezba,My morning started out OK but only because I was still somewhat satiated due to giving in last night. For awhile I was just sticking to mornings but its been twice a day here lately. Then around lunchtime I accidentally brushed my hand up against my chin and felt a hair I didnt like. Roughcoarsesharp just the works of everything that triggers me. I actually left fucking work on my lunch hour drove home and pulled it along with some others for good measure. Then raced back to the office.This has never happened before. It feels like a new low. I legit believe Im losing my goddamn mind and should be institutionalized.

5834161,0,t3_3v1uot,Meekoza I believe you sincerely want to help people with csp and we can disagree on my opinions on how and where you provide your input.  That is fine.  I respect sincerely and absolutely the rights of you and other members to disagree with me.However whenever you direct others to your site of employment and to your blog where I believe you are paid as a free lance author for your blog articles I feel  you should be upfront about your financial connection to that site in every comment or post where you refer people to Skinpick.com.  You cannot expect everyone to have read your post on this csp site about about you being a therapist  and blogger for skinpick.com and your purpose in joining our site l.  Not to be cynical but part of your reason for being here may be to direct potential customers to that site..  But similar to financial advisors on TV I think for the sake of transparency you should  reveal your connection to skinpick.com EVERY time you post or comment.  Then people can take that under consideration when reading your comments referring people to skinpick.com.Skinpick.com has some very good info on csp but it is also basically a referral site for online therapists such as yourself  in my personal opinion.I was concerned when you  answered a post from modern vintage recently entitledto paraphrase This has gotten completely out of control.   In your comment to thispost you recommended that modernvintage go to skinpick.com and your blog without revealing your connection to that site.  The way your comment was written I believe it would lead one to the conclusion that you had csp and  had found that sites blogs helpful.  I feel you you should have stated up front your connection with that site and  that you were the author of the blogsarticles.Again I personally feel that out of professional ethics you should state your connection with skinpick.com on every post or comment you make.Again to all who disagree with me these are my personal opinions and I absolutely respect other peoples right to Have their own.,CompulsiveSkinPicking,cxkdvw3,7,t5_2tcjc

Anorexia causes delusional thinking and seeing. Or like people addicted to plastic surgery they feel unattractive no matter how many surgeries they have so they keep getting surgery.  From my personal experience being in a picking cycle causes me to think I am helping my skin but I cannot get the spot perfectly cleaned out so I keep trying and trying over and over compulsively.

7636622,0,t1_d39s4fh,second halfyeah i was so mad when it happened!!! seriously. i was  this cousin of mine was  at the time i believe. and listen i literally do not care what people do for a living at all but he used to be a stripper. i guess that just shows that you could be in a profession that so many people do look down upon and yet you can still be incredibly ignorant yourself. yanno? and i had actually went on a trip to meet up with a girl that i had been talking to and she was very masculine they are actually going through transitioning FgtM now and my mom showed my cousin a picture of them and he was like she looks like a butch you know i bet your daughter is a lesbian and she went up there to be with her and i guess he had some supporting proof from facebook about it? i thought i had blocked all of my family and i didnt talk about it online but maybe hidden somewhere there was a comment where a girl complimented me or something..?? i dont know still. so i was hours from home got a text from my sister mom knows youre gay and i called my mom and found out what happened. mom was in disbelief and i was so angry that i couldnt do anything about it it kinda turned into the laughingmadeverything is a joke mood? best i could describe it. and mom just text me like so its true? and literally this is so embarrassing... my response was how you feel how you feel along with the  girls holding hands emojis. i felt like i was losing my mind and i wanted to be such a bitch i could not help it. i had gotten SO close to coming out. i just wanted to do it myself SO bad. the closest i had gotten was when i was at outback with my mom and i went to tell her and a waiter went by and she said ooo did you see him?! he was cute! and there went my chance. although i could have spun it off as no actually he isnt because i like girls mom. not how i wanted it to be. even though it ended up worse than that lol. i was so torn during my coming out because my mom cried for  days and did not get out of bed and she never talked to me about my interests in anyone because it grossed her out. and she told me i was gay due to trauma in my past trauma that happened to my sister as well and my sister actually said it happened to me too and im not gay so that doesnt make sense and my mom seriously had the nerve to say thats because youre stronger than your sister im not sure what i said in that moment because i was so mad but i have a feeling i might have given her a fuck you and ran off in tears. i realized my mom liked me more if i was hanging out with a guy or brought a guy up so i tried to do that. it didnt work and i wish i had just stayed true to myself. but i was so torn i wanted to make my mom happy and i wanted her to have an interest in my life. i never felt normal and idk. it was just crappy. i had no idea about your sexuality i mean you mentioned queer last night and i was not sure if you meant in a different sense or not and i didnt think it was my business to ask for a clarification. does your mom know? and dad? who cares about coming out to the rest anyway. its not like the straight kids have to be like hey everyone! im straight! just let people be. it doesnt matter if youre not in a relationship with them. sheesh. mine only know because that whole situation. yeah definitely not worth the hassle with some i do understand that. i was really upset bc i wanted my grandpa to meet my girlfriend before he passes but his health is very very bad and he has terrible anxiety along with his dementia and she was worried how he would react. i did take her over there to meet him though and he really loved her a lot. he knows we live together and its not talked about but he knows i think. and thankfully my mom is understanding of it all now. surprisingly she LOVES my girlfriend now. i would have never ever expected that to happen. yeah i would have wanted it to be different as well but oh well. like i said whys it matter to anyone if they arent dating you? i wish that coming out didnt even have to be a thing.definitely i know the amount of time i spent with them did form me into the person that i am today. they wereare awesome people. wow  that is truly heartbreaking. i cannot imagine how that mist have been for you. my grandmother was in hospice too at my aunts. that would have broken my heart. i get so upset when there IS something they could do to help someone but they dont want to. it is their decision though and i would never want to try and convince them to stay for my pleasure if it is ultimately hurting them. gosh it is so sad though. youre so brave for taking care of her. i dont know if i could have handled that. im sure i could if it were at that point but i dont know how well i would have. youre an amazing person.,CompulsiveSkinPicking,d3a8oyf,0,t5_2tcjc
7703708,0,t3_4kkxdt,A little late to the party here but just wanted to say this hits pretty close to him for me. I also work in a professional setting and routinely feel selfconscious about the marks on my face. My coworkers are used to it by now and have no doubt drawn their own conclusions i.e. theres the guy with the terrible skin disease. No ones ever actually said anything a happy byproduct I suppose of that professionalism. Still Im constantly checking my appearance and deliberately keep as low a profile as possible. It has definitely stunted my career development. Id actually like to find a new job but theres just no way I could handle interviewing like this which is intimidating enough even when you look your best.I wish I had better advice but Im in the same boat. I just try to manage the best I can daytoday. The pics look similar to what Ive done to myself on occasion. Probably not cause for concern unless youre prone to infection or if theyre looking worse instead of better. You might try Aquaphor or even regular Vaseline as an alternative to antibiotic ointments. They will promote a moist healing environment and if applied soon after injury prevent scab formation meaning you heal faster with less scarring. A lot of studies indicate that antibiotic ointments are not significantly more effective anyway. If you cant use these either then seconding the hydrocolloidal bandages advice which will accomplish the same. The kind they make for blisters would probably work pretty well.None of the above makes for a good look during the day obviously but you do what you have to. I have definitely called out of work after a particularly bad episode too. As if this disorder wasnt stigmatizing enough the additional burden of expressing it in a form that is very visibledifficult to conceal is something that doesnt get talked about a lot.

10029784,0,t3_5iwoov,Ive just hit my first successful month of being pretty much picking free whether it be acne or just pieces of my skin. The thing that helped me the most was to recognize when Im analyzing my skin before the picking starts. For me this is when my compulsion starts so I try to break that and do something good for my skin instead and shifting the need to pick. Sometimes I splash my facewhatever part of my skin I wish to pick with cold water for a bit do a gentle face mask not too often though or use this rosewater spray I have on the area that I want to get at. If I still feel the need to pic afterwards I do something with my hands like playing with silly puttysqueezing something or knitting. Anything like that really helped me make the push to start the end of my picking.

Ill start scratching at my face. When I was a kid Id pull out my eyelashes while reading and that was before we had things like smartphones.Im glad it works for you at least! Id love to be able to read more often. ,CompulsiveSkinPicking,de38w2d,6,t5_2tcjc
10910180,0,t1_de4qwlx,I almost feel the picking is a grounding technique. I work with adults with autism and a lot of time when they are anxious or agitated they will have self injurious behavior. I think this is a subtle snap out of it thing for us. ,CompulsiveSkinPicking,de5b39x,1,t5_2tcjc
11220155,0,t3_5zcoq1,I used to pick the skin at my scalp a lot too and it got to the point where I had bald patches from pulling out the hair to get the to scab. The only way I found to stop the scalp picking was to have someone my dad in this case comb through my hair and put cream dermovate on all the scabs. I dont know if this will work for you because mine began as psoriasis and so they healed almost immediately from the cream. However I do think the process of caring for my scalp and taking time to really give it some attention was also really helpful. I dont know how to stop the skin picking problem because I havent managed that yet myself and as you say when something heals you just move on to somewhere else. However for now Ive discovered these tangle toys which I am in love with they keep your hands really busy and just can entertain me for hours. I find them constantly in my hand without even realising it just like Id find my fingers picking at my face without realising it. Have you tried cognitive behavioural therapy?,CompulsiveSkinPicking,df3sgyy,1,t5_2tcjc
11329193,0,t3_61o1mh,Hang in there. Your situation sounds like how my moms used to be picking hands arms face. While shes always been a picker and probably always will she managed to quit picking her arms and face over the past few years so on that note I can say that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. As for me M Ive been lucky enough to only feel the urge to pick my fingers and wherever I may find rough skin which I dont have all too often. All I can really say is that gloves have helped me a ton. I have them on me all the time. I have a pair at work. I have a pair at home. There is something sitting about them that when I have them on the urge to pick just fades away most of the time. If you consider this route get a pair that allow you to use your phone while you have them on. When I take mine off for whatever reason Ill soon start picking again. Some things Im also finding is that is helpful for me foam fingernail file and nail clippers. I use the file to get my nails down to a smooth edge to where they cant really even do damage to my skin. If that isnt working Ill clip the skin flat and smooth so that it doesnt feel scratchy and rough which is my biggest trigger. I hope this helps in some way. One big thing that I remember was that about  months after graduating college during a gap year I noticed for the first time since I could remember that my hands were completely healed and I hadnt picked in weeks. While of course I would eventually pick again I still remember the elation I felt in that moment of realization. College was definitely a rough patch for my picking so I have great hopes for you and that itll get better. Best of luck!,CompulsiveSkinPicking,dfg58ir,1,t5_2tcjc
11440283,0,t1_dfsqlx8,Thats a good idea! I recently got my arms waxed and because the hairs were pulled in the opposite direction they grow I now have a bunch of tiny ingrowns on my upper arms. Its been hard but Ive barely picked and am proud. My face however lets just say its not so good. My acne was pretty good no big active pimples but LOTS of those little tiny ones on my forehead and last night I went crazy and picked them all. My face really hurts today but Im going to hang a blanket over my bathroom mirror again because it helped last time.,CompulsiveSkinPicking,dfsquja,1,t5_2tcjc
11598773,0,t3_65ijde,Ive got one of these and really like it. I do bring it to work  actually I keep it in my purse. Despite being metal it makes no sound.,CompulsiveSkinPicking,dgaq9tc,2,t5_2tcjc
