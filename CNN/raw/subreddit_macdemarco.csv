10841289,0,t1_ddxq768,Im pretty sure its about him growing up and watching himself grow older hence Look at all the steps that brought you were you are today and Look in the mirror who do you see? Someone familiar but surely not me. For it cant be me look how old and cold and tired and lonely hes become. I dont think hes referring to his dad in that song. But thats just me though it can be interpreted in different ways. Who knows maybe its a little bit of both.,macdemarco,ddy7aob,3,t5_2xk6n

11591809,0,t3_65fuz0,Mac just attracts that type of crowd sadly. I dont want to sound like a snob saying that these kids arent true fans and that theyre only there to seem cool but a part of me believes its true. I also lowkey hope this new record helps drive away those types of fans because of how different it is from salad days and . But muh jangley guitar but muh viceroys man seems to be the image I keep getting in my head when I see these types reacting to the new record. I know Im ranting and I sound like a cunt but its just how I feel. ,macdemarco,dg9xudl,71,t5_2xk6n
11600988,0,t3_65kjwc,Physical copies are probably being shipped to stores right now all it takes is one person to fingerdiscount a copy and leak it online.

11645125,0,t1_dgfxz9r,while i agree with your general point about stealing an idea of whatever u gotta realize CT probably wont make shirts that are as nice as the one that the dude made. They will do some shitty drawing and assume die hard mac fans will buy it because it is a mac thing. Also macs general audience is between the age of . Those people like I are either broke struggling college kids or just making good enough money for a teenager. If his fucking album is  dollars and id have to choose between not eating for  days or torrenting an album ill torrent the album with no guilt in my mind. ,macdemarco,dgfzlq3,3,t5_2xk6n
