7899418,0,t1_d42nfq9,Yeah I figured the Koga was a good option and I think it looks good too I just wondered if the Fuji wasnt as good as the Koga performance wise or something theres not a lot of reviews out there and I dont know anyone whos spent time on both frames.  feels a bit steep for appearances and reputation IMHO but Id pay it for even the smallest justification outside of that.Edited for grammar and spelling,Velodrome,d43yvko,2,t5_2vyqi
8048876,0,t1_d4jf0xq,I hadnt considered the Hoy but they do look quite nice. Im a bit iffy about the paint job on both but Ill add them to the list to keep an eye on. The bloke riding the bike definitely makes the most difference so Im under no illusions that a nicer bike will make me any faster haha. I dont plan on upgrading anytime soon so I thought I may as well get something nice that I can look forward to riding regularly.,Velodrome,d4krp7y,1,t5_2vyqi
8519787,0,t1_d66h4ik,Im in Aus so Ill also look into the BT sprint bars. I do have a traditional stem system and I understand what youre saying about wanting the grips as close to the tyre as possible but with the Alpinas I really dont think Ill be able to hold that position and perform at my best currently. If I cant breathe properly and hold the proper position because the handlebar drop is too much for me then it wont do.I know youve got some good points about the Alpinas but Im still leaning more toward the Ls but now in  cm wide instead of the s. Im not too worried about the price as Ive had the money set aside for a while now.,Velodrome,d66j8jv,1,t5_2vyqi

8655671,0,t1_d6nihr0,What would be a good front crankset? Im on a budget but dont want to buy a cheap set. What is the requirements for crank length? My current is mm with mm bottom bracket.,Velodrome,d6nko2v,1,t5_2vyqi
9643068,0,t1_da1o7g4,Indeed. At least the World Cups have a live final day on Youtube. But overall coverage isnt the greatest.,Velodrome,da1pgu4,1,t5_2vyqi
