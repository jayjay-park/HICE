1073881,0,t1_chqco1h,Very close syntatically.gtGNU Octave is mostly compatible with MATLAB. However Octaves parser allows some often very useful syntax that MATLABs does not so programs written for Octave might not run in MATLAB. For example Octave supports the use of both single and double quotes. MATLAB only supports single quotes which means parsing errors will occur if you try to use double quotes e.g. in an Octave script when run on MATLAB. Octave and MATLAB users who must collaborate with each other need to take note of these issues and program accordingly.    gtNote Octave can be run in traditional mode by including the traditional flag when starting Octave which makes it give an error when certain Octaveonly syntax is used.

Also if you run a political party that competes in SGA elections then you run the risk of the only people getting anywhere are people who are likeminded have to agree on a set of issues and are more or less buddybuddy  think about it if people join the party and want to run for SGA office theyd have to compete with each other in a primary right? Then you have to have other parties that people can join.... Finally other organizations that help advertise or whatever in any way then start causing drama and splits in the student population.gtAfter that we would represent the student body as a whole and try to effect positive change for all Tech students.Just like traditional government parties right?If youre frustrated start an awareness club. Students for mental health or similar which I believe there already are similar organization  ask the folks at Stamps who run some of the awareness campaigns there. Join the PampT committe get involved in housing join SGA best bet etc. It may sound like a waste of time and they dont get anywhere but they do and they are the appropriate route.

After speaking with the DoS I was sent to the Womens Resource Center and from there I was sent to the Counseling Center who gave me a consultation determined that I had PTSD and needed counseling and then ignored me.  I have it all documented.      When I was in crisis mode I did try to see a psychiatrist.  That was actually the very first thing I did because I did not know about the counseling center.  I was told by the receptionist that I was going to have to pay something like  for a session that would happen in a week or two.  Now I know that is untrue and that students get  free sessions but that means that theres people working there who dont know what theyre talking about.  Being told Id have to pay  I didnt have made me shy away from even considering that option.   Its not easy to get help here.  I understand the intention of your post but what it sounds like is youre saying people like myself had a bad experience because they didnt try hard enough or use all the resources available to them.,gatech,cog3vyd,4,t5_2r8t2

3541752,0,t1_cpvvgmq,First attacking me for expressing my concerns over SGA candidates is juvenile. Im a student at this school and Im allowed to want to hold my candidates to a higher standard. Ass.Second I dont watch Sean Hannity or Fox News so I dont really understand the parallels. Third youre trying to minimize the relevance of SGA and I dont think you actually understand how important SGA is. Youre coming off as bitter and cynical about the process similar to people who say Why should I vote? My vote doesnt matter anyway. Youre just turning a blind eye because its easier and more convenient than actually being involved and aware. Educate yourself first before you just say SGA doesnt matter.Youre trying to say that someone raising awareness for their campaign through buttons or stickers is somehow a disqualification? What? Your cynicism is showing again.So am I to understand here that you have no clue who these people are yet you assert that They havent done anything of note? That seems about right. It makes sense that a random person on the internet knows enough about them to comment on their accolades and accomplishments. I do know that they arent involved in SGA but youre right! I dont know them. This video was their chance to introduce themselves and discuss their ideas and what qualifies them as candidates and they absolutely didnt discuss any of that at all.They arent saying they dont want to waste their time on the position. I think theyre saying that they dont want to hand out buttons around campus and make tshirts and do all the frufru stuff. They even say themselves that theyll take the position seriously if elected? Do you really think that someone wouldnt? Come on. Grow up. I dont think that at all. I think one way a candidate shows their passion and commitment is by putting in effort through campaigning by trying to disseminate their ideas as much as they possibly can. Saying you dont want to do that is saying that you really dont care enough to put in the effort. Shitting on buttons and posters doesnt make you better than other campaigns that are trying their hardest to spread their message. Thats the fucking purpose of a political campaign. Once again do you really believe that someone wont do a good job with a serious position just because they arent blowing people for likes on Facebook? Honestly. You sound like one of those cynical people who sit alone watching Sean Hannity with a bottle of lotion and some tissues. Campaigning is more than facebook dumb dumb. Part of a campaign is establishing a well defined platform with fully fleshed out ideas. That takes effort and shows commitment and an understanding of the process and what the political realities are. They havent done that at all. I fail to see their use of buzzwords. Not two sentences after saying you dont believe theyd put forth effort with the position you say you expect that out of them? That seems a tad backwards. Clean slate and open mind are buzzwords. And I dont understand your second sentence so I cant respond to it.Im sorry what? What is hypocritical about being in a fraternity? I dont see your point. Are you one of those people that hates the Greek system because you didnt get a bid? Sounds like another Sean Hannity alert. I dont want this to turn into an antigreek circlejerk but do you not understand that fraternities basically use a popularity contest to judge who to let into the frat? I also didnt rush but thanks for the personal attacks. They really convey how douchey you are.Christ. Do you have a sense of humor? Or are you the Fox News reporting on Georgia Tech SGA Elections? Second I think by brevity they mean they will get things done quickly as opposed to dragging things out and never actually getting anything done. I have a great sense of humor thanks. I mean who doesnt love Louis CK? I will always laugh at a good joke. However I dont think discussing your qualifications for SGA are the time or place to tell jokes. And as far as brevity is concerned I think thats a good thing but again Id expect that of any candidate so saying it is just fluff. I think being actually good friends is a huge qualification. Rather than just finding someone popular to run with they decided to do it together. It means theyll work together. I agree that having a healthy strong relationship with who youre running is important. But thats not the main point I was making or they were making in the video. In the video they were discussing how the fact that theyre living together somehow increases the legitimacy of their candidacy which it doesnt. Its a pretty stupid thing to assert which is what I was getting at.So you think that Georgia Tech entrusts your hard earned money to be spent by two students? That sounds reasonable. And once again jesus take a joke. So what theyre lighthearted? I dont think thats a bad thing. Like Ive said I can appreciate someone being lighthearted and I can appreciate joking around. However it has to be grounded in some sort of actual message or platform neither of which they have. In the video he says theyd pursue two to three objectives for the year. Okay... What objectives? What are you going to work on? Theyre just running to run. Not to actually effect change.This is something which I take seriously so excuse you for trying to shame me. I think government is important at every level and being blase about it doesnt make you cool or better than me. And it does affect me. Again turning a blind eye to the machinations of government is foolhardy. Minimizing the importance of government is foolhardy. And attacking me personally is crass and low. ,gatech,cpvzd9h,0,t5_2r8t2

3725709,0,t3_331cou,Graduated in May . Had no jobs lined up so my full time job became customizing job applications every day. I had no internship experience and had no industry connections so I knew I was in for the long haul. Was unemployed until the end of October when I finally landed a job. I applied to hundreds of jobs and got a few phone interviews and had four onsite interviews with the same company that ended up giving me an offer. I moved to Texas and am really enjoying it here. My manager is great coworkers are nice have amazing benefits Im working at one of my dream companies and I am interested in what I do. I feel like the super depressing  months of unemployment with almost no interviews was worth it for this. As for knowledge Id say I probably use maybe  of what I actually learned at Tech at my job. A lot of what I use is technical communication skills I picked up from group projects doing undergrad research and TAing. So much is covered in the AE curriculum that I really only deal with a small portion of what I actually learned while I was in school. One difference is that it is way less stressful than Tech.

And last question I have no idea how classes work yet and havent really looked at courses yet how long after I start taking classes would I be able to change my major if I want out?I cant answer your question about CS but this one I think I can. Compared to high school youll be doing a lot more homework and groupwork with fellow students but youll have friends quickly enough. Your average high school drama is not a thing. But it will be very subjective how close you are with your friends.For classes you may take one or two major specific classes your freshman year. Generally if you dont change your major sophomore year you need to stick with it  youll have your core classes and at this point are still just getting into your major so a lot of classes that you already take may still apply. If you change your major to something similar like CmpE youre probably not setting yourself back If you change to the likes of MechE or INTA for example youre going to lose a good chunk of time. ,gatech,cqig5hm,2,t5_2r8t2

You will have to give them proof of income or something along those lines and theyll make you sign some insane page lease and addendum after addendum after addendum. Then the maintenance will be complete shit. No heat when you move into the place in November? Yeah thatll be a week to fix. Air conditioner not working? Itll take them a week to send someone out and flip some circuit breaker that turns it on. Mysterious leak in the ceiling between the two floors and the light fixture stops working and the ceiling develops mold as a result? Ah theyll just paint right over it no big deal. Its not like that light was really needed there were other lights in the apartment.I never felt unsafe or threatened in the neighborhood. Of course I grew up in a mixedrace neighborhood and dont freak out at the sight of black people which seems to be the reason everyone says its a sketchy area. It really isnt. Its nothing but apartments an elementary school and a Hampton Inn whose primary visitors are parents there to visit their kids at Tech.The location was convenient to Tech and the apartment was quite cheap. Unfortunately it seems to be cheap because they dont bother to do maintenance to keep the apartments in working order.I stayed there until my lease expired and went somewhere much nicer rented a condo probably well outside of collegestudent budget.Its a shame  the location is nice and the apartments are better looking than Home Parks houses for rent with gated parking instead of drivewaystreet parking. The problem is just the management is incompetent. Theyre not asshole landlords as far as I can tell theyre just trying to manage a crapload of buildings with adequate handyman staff for maybe a quarter of it. And well a few of the people in the office are in fact incompetent. I have the feeling upper management just runs it with the plan to cut costs as much as possible and just freeride their location to profit. Eventually theyll probably sell it to someone who upgrades the place at which point itll be truly awesome and the price will go up but itll probably still be cheaper than some of the other options.Edit my experience with them was in  so if there has been a management change as others have said in this thread then some of that stuff may not apply. ,gatech,cs9cek4,5,t5_2r8t2

4456803,0,t3_3c4vk1,Background Ive been living with depression and anxiety disorder since middle school but it was never really diagnosed and properly treated until I got to college. During my nd semester at Tech I broke down and almost failed out.I have  points about the mental health resources I went to the counseling center and met with someone there  times it did not help and actually made me feel worse. IMO if you have a really serious mental health issue and are not receiving any other help or if youve never been told what illness you have the counseling center alone may not be your best option. I know a few people who have had success meeting regularly with both the psychiatrist and counseling center. you do have to pay after a certain number of visits though Getting a psychiatry appointment is tough. A lot of people come into Tech already knowing they will need to meet regularly and book ahead of time. The soonest time available I could get was  weeks out and conflicted with my schedule. I eventually gave up trying to schedule an appointment and stopped seeing the counseling center fortunately the semester was almost over but I would not have taken any chances earlier in the semester. That summer I went home and got treatment. Sophomore year I changed majors and did much better. I am on medication and during the school year every  weeks I have a meeting with my therapist over the phone.The thing about Tech or any school is you need to be thorough and establish good habits. If you cannot dedicate a decent portion of your energy toward your coursework whether it be because of mental illness distractions etc. you will not do well. When I say energy I dont mean time just think quantity over quality. You can stare at your notes and textbook for  hours a day but if you cant focus or are plagued by depressed thoughts and lack of motivation those  hours are worth less. No matter where you go I recommend seeking help before entering college. The more information you have about your condition the easier it will be for the counseling centerpsychiatrist to help you. Also medication is tricky it took the whole summer for me and my psychiatrist to work out a good medicinedosage. If you decide to take that route I would not recommend this process during the school year.,gatech,cssgmnz,3,t5_2r8t2

There is definitely a strange pride people have in being overworked and underrested. Its weird. When this mindset becomes the majority suddenly all the people who believe in getting a proper  hours of shuteye are seen as lazy. This situation gets nasty when its applied to tests with high failure rates that rely on curves. When the game changes to relying on a curve to pass and consequently having to beat out the guys and gals to your left and right for a good position in the upcoming curve things get nasty.Youre story sounds similar to mine but in another locale. I was never groomed for greatness by my parents or anything but I can definitely pick up on that in some of my friends. It sucks because it usually means they have a few more smarts than us but on the flip side I think it makes us grittier. Learning to adapt or roll with the punches has made me a stronger person. Not sure how else to describe it besides stronger. I just feel more capable to come out on top when a hairy situation arises that demands rapid adaption than some of my more groomed peers.Yeah I would agree with that as well.

5321984,0,t3_3nvzeg,While I support the motive behind this idea we should see a more complete justification before the fight song is changed.  This petition treats it as given that the lyrics are harmful and assumes with barely a line of argument that the change will be supported.  Altering this tradition should not be viewed as such a trivial matter.If we do this it should be a deliberate and thoughtful action.  If it is worth sacrificing  years of tradition to better reflect the progressed state of our world a better argument can easily be made.  Georgia Tech should clearly state the harm its fight song causes and fully back up how its changes will be effective or risk widespread resentment.The petition in its current form seems more like an attempt to preempt criticism of the Institution or feel good about causing some progress while ultimately helping very little.  Its time for a sanity check.  While the language of the song is admittedly exclusionary does anyone really see it as representative of modern Georgia Tech?  We dont need to change our fight song to be a progressive and welcoming place of learning.  The growing femalemale ratio and widespread acceptance of women on campus accomplish in fact what this change attempts to accomplish only in name.  I just dont think it is right to push through this petition without properly addressing these type of concerns.  ,gatech,cvry1w0,25,t5_2r8t2
5328502,1,t1_cvrzxlh,I get why people dont want to change it I really do. Its a part of the schools and the students identity. And history is a big part of that identity. If the connection to the schools history is an integral component of the song for you then I absolute think you are justified in wanting to keep it the same. But pretending like the song does nothing to marginalize womens role at Tech seems a bit naive. The song heavily implies that women cannot be a true techie she can stand on the sidelines and cheer sure. But she will never be one of them like her daddy used to be. There sre also some subtle issues of autonomy. From a historical perspective this is absolutely accurate. She literally could not be a tech student so in that context it makes perfect sense. But is it true anymore? No not at all. So the question becomes should the song be a reflection of Tech as it exists today or a homage to what it was. I honestly think there is no right answer. History as I mentioned previously is very important. But I can understand why some people want to change it. Its really not as baffling as these comments imply.,gatech,cvss00y,7,t5_2r8t2

I remember when I was a young child think age  to  and several black boys I knew would say really outrageous racist things against white people. Im using the colloquial definition of racism not the definition used in the talk. The boys werent actually racist they were just pushing the boundaries to see what they could get away with. But their defense would frequently be black people cant be racist if called out on it. Obviously they dont understand privilege and power so what they mean is black people are allowed to be discriminatory.Fast foward to middle school. I went to school in the middle of the ghetto. Railroad tracks high crime area  black student body codereds  times a year. The works. Boys know what racism is they know that its wrong and yet I still hear black people cant be racist after racially inflammatory statements. Almost as if they believe it!And so NOW I hear black people cant be racist. And people forget to follow it up with because they dont have power that draws from their race. But that doesnt stop black people from being bigoted and racially discriminatory. My point is you have to be really really careful when you say something like black people cant be racist.

5424099,0,t3_3pbio6,The problem is your genuine good intentions are at odds with the realities of being among the hoi polloi in a large structure operated by the state.The fact of the matter is people who are well educated well informed principled and willing to act upon the injustices they see are hopelessly outnumbered.   Less than half the people in this country vote.   And how many of those who do vote just vote a straight party ticket?   How many are totally unfamiliar with third parties running?  How many could even identify the US Senate and US House majorityminority leaders if shown their photos?    By the time you cull out the people who dont know what theyre doing almost nobody is left.  The same applies at GT.  How many students at GT could tell you who the President is?  How many could identify the positions of people they voted for in student government?  How many of the people running for student government even bothered to have a well informed outlook and agenda for change in the first place?Im not discouraging you from trying to enact change.  But keep in mind your time is not free.   How much of your time would you need just to get a dozen people on board?   A hundred?   Youd need a few thousand just to make a dent.   GT just like any other political power structure will not move to enact changes until things reach crisis level.  It takes the proverbial pitchforks on the horizon before political systems move.   It wasnt until  empty seats per game a loss of game to say nothing of evaporating AT Fund donations that they got rid of Chan Gailey as head coach of the football team.  Discontent fans made it more expensive to keep Chan than to fire him.   Well to affect real political change you need similar broad based numbers working in your favor.   The best way youre going to do that is probably to do as H.L. Mencken says and spread some discontent like this subreddit is doinggtThe most dangerous man to any government is the man who is able to think things out for himself without regard to the prevailing superstitions and taboos. Almost inevitably he comes to the conclusion that the government he lives under is dishonest insane and intolerable and so if he is romantic he tries to change it.

6020728,0,t3_3xjn45,Thats a complicated question depending mostly upon the specific classsituation.In general if the professor gives out practice exams or gives you back your exams you can share them with other students without violating the Honor Code unless the syllabus of the class states that students may not receivereview material from outside of the current class.However if the professor asks you to not share the exams or does not provide the exams back to you for example retaining the final exams doing something like stealing a final exam and sharing it would definitely be a violation of the honor code. In the case of copyrighted work there is also a legal issue to be resolved outside of the Honor Code which is also tricky and situation dependent.  In general sharing with one other person is unlikely to get you in trouble but posting it on the Internet far and wide could potentially be actionable. ,gatech,cy8ub17,1,t5_2r8t2

7128952,0,t3_4d7ak8,I worked for several professors before I found my PhD thesis advisor. Many students find their advisors by doing well in one of their classes and then asking to work for them if you are interested in their research. You can also search for advisors based on the research topics they list on their websites. Read their most recent publications to see what they are currently researching. Then you have to send them an email or track them down to ask if you can do research for them. Ask the professor if they will let you take a special problems  topics class with them where you work on a research project for a semester and publish a paper based on your work. The best thing about this route is that if you dont work well with the professor at the end of the semester its not too big of a deal to discontinue research with them since it was technically a semester class. No feelings hurt.Edit I read the question sort of incorrectly the first time. I answered how to find your thesis advisor. Finding your thesis topic should be a mixture of what you are interested in and what an advisor will accept as being close enough to their own research interests. So to recap.... Think of topic that interests you.. Find professors that are working in that field.. Talk to professors tell them what you want to do they will modify what you suggest.,gatech,d1ohccl,7,t5_2r8t2

7243721,0,t3_4ec08v,This Summer plan for some intensive cognitive behavioral therapy for the Fall semester during the time you will start struggling. Tell your professors what you are going through right now. You will be surprised how much better it could make you feel to know they know you are capable but struggling. Is going home on the weekends a possibility? I always found it comforting. Remember school is not all. Whatever you are abusing give it to somebody you trust on Thursdays. Or get the pharmacy to give your doses weekly rather than monthly. Yes I experienced the same at Tech but at a different time of the semester it was during dead week and finals week. I managed to keep the grades stable but the toll on my body was unimaginable. I would literally drop  to  kg during dead week and finals week combined. I think in my case it comes from a deep sense of insecurity to finalize projects when things depend on me only since there is not a structure during dead week and finals week. Sometimes this still happens every time I am right about to finish a project I find myself struggling with time management  focusing on the wrong things or thinking too much in the smallest details and just fearing failure. Back at Tech this translated to pretty much me making the decision to not sleep for  weeks because I was afraid of failing my finals and I would be so scared I could not even study at all.

Do not take marching band as a free elective or as an easy class.It is a serious time commitment but as long as you put in the work thats expected of you you will get an A. That being said if you are going into it with the mentality that its an easy or filler class for you you will be miserable and you will likely make your sectionmates miserable as well. For the good majority of people in band its not a class but something that theyre passionate about. Generally speaking the sections are tightknit groups of friends and the larger band is a loosely associated group of people who are all highly passionate about making music although the trumpets really suck. Marching is not a class it is a lifestyle. Dont get me wrong its hella fun but its not for everyone.On a more personal note I am very highly offended that you would even consider the marching band as just an easy class that youre taking to satisfy requirements. We put in a lot of work to make gamedays more enjoyable and enhance the student experience at Tech. Were considered one of the major traditionkeeping bodies at Tech. For you to boil that down to an easy class really really ticks me off.That being said I hope my earlier advice helps you make a decision on joining if youre serious about it.Trumpets do not actually suck this is a joke.

7808634,0,t3_4m2rr5,So I came in MSE and didnt really consider any other majors. They recruited at my highschool and offered a scholarship which is part of the reason I didnt look at anything else.As you can tell from my username I have since switched majors to EE. I changed after working in an MSE lab full time the summer after my freshman year. I hated that job and became jaded towards academia and MSE in general so take my opinion with that in mind. What I found was that MSE was a hybrid of several majors that made you a jack of all trades but master of none. The consequence of that is that the MSE field is extremely graduate studies focused with a large portion of the jobs being for PhDs forcing most MSE students to continue on to graduate school. Since I had a bad time with research the idea of graduate school wasnt the most appealing.That being said the department has a lot of great people and as a whole is much more personal with the students because it is such a small major. This opens up a world of networkingtype opportunities to make connections and the MSE department even has their own career fair.If you have an interest in a specific field within MSE Id highly suggest going for it because it really is a good major. If you think you just have an interest in it because its a mix of majors that dangerous and I would encourage you to look into the other majors at Tech more.As a sidenote our school is very Polymers focused. My main interest was in materials for electronics and there just werent that many classes in MSE on those topics.,gatech,d3tr5ca,2,t5_2r8t2

I made a .The final was the easiest thing in the entire class.Sundays and Mondays were dedicated to working on homework assignments which typically were five questions.We derived matrix multiplication. Not Okay so this is a thing we call matrix mulitplication we went through a nocontext proof for  minutes and in the end we had something vaguely familiar followed by and if you keep going about ten steps youll arrive at what we know as matrix multiplication.It was literally the worst academic experience of my life.

Youre comparing apples and oranges. The OMS CS program targets working professionals who want to get a MS CS degree without quitting their job to become a fulltime student. That has nothing to do with the content they could just as easily offer a OMS CompE too. The difference between the curricula would probably still be true.Your question makes even less sense because you seem to be deciding between OMS CS or MS CompE.

11303993,0,t3_616zwi,Id say for sure take ECE   ECE  since those are prerequisites for a lot of classes. Although its only  credits  really feels like  credits. On top of that maybe add ECE . Its object oriented programming with C so if you have experience with it maybe in CS  or took APCS in high school or just know OOP then it should really not be that bad. Otherwise you might need to spend some time with it but still doable. That right there is  major classes so maybe just add a light humanities class or APPH ,gatech,dfdah8r,1,t5_2r8t2

11604646,0,t3_65kvcs,Its really hard to find the actual facts of this case and this article and every other article I can find seems biased towards Dr. Laskar. He was accused of misusing M in grant money which is not a small amount. Every graduate student faculty memeber or anyone involved in research at all undergoes research ethics and conflict of interest training where these types of things are explicitly covered so he HAD to have known he was at the very least in a gray area.  Seems like Tech and GBI overreacted but without knowing the specifics of how that M was spent its really impossible to say whether it was deliberate misconduct or just negligent. ,gatech,dgbe9vp,21,t5_2r8t2

They say I can only take out like  before its all private loans so then my total loan would be the  of federal unsubsidized plus  of parent plus. I dont remember the exact number but I know they said I would have to take out private loans.Is that true? Or can I take out as much that is left in my cost assuming my parents are approved?

11795906,0,t1_dgx0v9o,UCLAs engineering program is considered great but not on par with Tech. Cal Stanford and to a lesser extent San Jose and Santa Clara have the best reputationare the largest feeders in the valley.However if you switch into engineering at Tech youre probably going to be a bit more constrained in terms of job opportunities than you would be at UCLA. Since much of Techs engineering majors stay in the south you just dont have the same network that you would at UCLA.Thats more a result of how few engineering positions there are in the valley compared to CS. Its mostly software with only a smattering of hardware. If you stay CS though both UCLA and GT are great choices. GT CS has an almost equal if not greater presence in the valley as UCLA. Social life is what you make of it. If you stay in your room all day of course youll never meet anyone. If you make an effort the first couple weeks to talk to people then youll be fine.Tech isnt some social wasteland where everybody stays in their room all day playing league. There are people who do that but most students actually get out some of the time.About moving to CA for that in state tuition Im sure your parents have looked it over but Ill reiterate. Moving to California is expensive AF. Youve got the sky high state income tax state gas tax LA county  sales tax housing costs and generally higher CoL. Im not even sure if its worth it for the in state tuition at that point.,gatech,dgx3ttt,2,t5_2r8t2
