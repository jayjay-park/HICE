1049898,0,t3_263m6y,AURORA  The city of Aurora plans to turn one of its most outdated public pools into the citys first water park which will be partially open by June .The Del Mar pool at  Del Mar Circle was built in   and has never been renovated. The public pool is part of the .acre Del Mar Park that includes the Aurora Center for Active Adults.Lori Daniel manager of recreation services in Aurora said attendance at  the pool began to decline in .  Revenue went down and the annual cost of maintaining the pool was out of control.Our pool maintenance staff was working with peeling plaster and other constant problems Daniel said. The antiquated mechanical system was not waterefficient and it really needed a complete overhaul.Plans for the new Del Mar Family Aquatic Center began in . They include a new bathhouse a full concession stand a meter pool with a diving well water slide and lap lanes as well as shade structures and a spray park playground.The spray park will open  July  said Tracy Young manager of planning design and construction at Aurora Parks Recreation and Open Spaces.  The entire aquatic center is slated to open by Memorial Day  she said.Its wonderful for the community because this new facility will not only service this neighborhood but it will probably draw from around all of Aurora because of the new features were putting in Daniel said.The water park will be constructed by Golden Triangle Construction Inc. from Longmont. Young said the total cost is about . million  all paid for out of the Conservation Trust Fund from Auroras portion of the Colorado Lottery.The need for a public swimming pool in the North Aurora neighborhoods is great said Sonia SkakichScrima president of Village Green Neighbors Association.It really is a huge benefit in the area to have something like this she said. Water World is quite a trek from Aurora and having a huge renovation project means that the city is investing a considerable amount in original Aurora and reaffirming the importance of that area.SkakichScrima started the neighbors association in  to lobby for the preservation of the Village Green public pool which closed in  but reopened last summer.There have been attempts over the years to try and expand some of the old facilities that are available like the Parklane  and Moorhead pools SkakichScrima said. Given the high population density in this area this is the right move.The west side of Del Mar Park will also undergo renovation including facelifts for the parking lot the playground the walkways shelter and outdoor restrooms. The park also contains a tennis center basketball courts and open fields.Daniel said the parks  department is planning weekly family engagement activities in the park this summer. Some options shes considering are a Slip N Slide day fitness camps nature talks and sports camps.The schedule will be nailed down as construction on the aquatic center begins the week of March .Megan Mitchell  or mmitchelldenverpost.com,AuroraCO,chnmmhd,1,t5_2uwzp

5871039,0,t1_cxp7m4k,But the way you explain it the police dont have the right to take you off the road until after the crime has been committed. DUI checkpoints give us the ability to remove you from the road before you kill people. Hiding behind a misunderstood constitutional amendment puts all of us at risk just so you can enjoy having too many drinks at the bar. ,AuroraCO,cxp83lh,-1,t5_2uwzp
