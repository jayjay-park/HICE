7960386,0,t3_4o9u8z,I immediately thought of this as a Ginger snake. If youre a HP fan Weasley could be a snake name for either a boy or girl or any of the kids names. I tend to pull names from things that Im interested in though or the dictionary or thesaurus.I once had a dog named Xyster because a xyster is an instrument used to clean and scrape bones. ,cornsnakes,d4atmfq,1,t5_2yeo2
