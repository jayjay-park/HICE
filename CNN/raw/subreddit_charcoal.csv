6216419,0,t3_40pofa,First of all congratulations on your grill. You made a good choice with the smokey joe itll last forever.To grease my grill I get it hot then cut an onion in half dip the face in oil whatever kind and use that to brush the grate. Oil it before you cook every time and again when youre done. You can clean it before you start cooking with a crumpled up ball of aluminum foil.You let the coals burn until theyre lit. Thats gray for briquettes kingsford etc and mostly red for lump charcoal the stuff that looks like black pieces of wood. Lump has a little more neutral flavor but theyre more advanced. Very hot burning and hard to moderate. Briquettes are what you should use at first. Dont use the match light just use normal blue bag kingsford. You could use some wood chips like pecan or oak for flavor. Mesquite apple and cherry are all loud and can easily be too strong. With wood chips a little goes a long way. Play with them and see what you like. Just toss a few on the coals while youre cooking. No need to soak them.As the other commenter said get one of those chimneys and learn to use it. You wont need it even halffull for the smokey joe. Finally I always recommend for anybody getting into grilling the Cooks Illustrated Guide to Grilling and Barbecue. Ive got dozens and dozens of books on this subject but theirs is the best bar none. A great introduction with some nobullshit recipes for stuff like burgers and steak that are timeless and foolproof then more complex stuff for when you get your sea legs. Perfect for the beginner and it will grow with you. Heres a copy I found on eBay for  free shipping. Its worth it.  and no Im not the seller lol  goodwill is.,charcoal,cyw8nja,1,t5_2s931
6824398,0,t1_d0ptzos,I was thinking it was a front yard grill they tend to run hot. Are you letting them fully heat up solid grey ash around all the brisquets? Are you controlling the amount of air once they have heated up?,charcoal,d0pueok,3,t5_2s931

Just a touch of smoke and a lot of classic charcoal cooking flavors. Keep the coals on the lowmedium side but again you are grilling not doing low and slow. ,charcoal,d60kb5j,1,t5_2s931
