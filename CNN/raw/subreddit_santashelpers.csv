Mets fan  NYC area? Brooklyn Navy Yard tour. New York Harbor Sail. Trip to the Baseball Hall of Fame although that might exceed your budget. Tickets to a lecture series. Participate with him in an ImprovEverywhere event. See a TED talk together. National Parks pass also slightly out of budget but maybe you could team up with another family member. Two tickets purchased online to NYs premier wax museumIm sure most of these will be missing the mark but maybe theres one or two that get your gears turning.s a good age hes still young and spry enough to keep up with and enjoy physical activity youre probably at an age where your relationship with him is changing as you mature it sounds like you guys have a loving relationship. On the surface you have different interests but it seems like you both value family makingfixing things engaging physically with your possessions home and surroundings etc. Pick something youd both enjoy find the thing you have in common and do something together.,santashelpers,cmpdgkf,4,t5_2vjt7
