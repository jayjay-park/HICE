121113,0,t3_1vgnnw,I am a physics major and Ive had to change a few things about my handwriting so I dont get confused when writing equations and such in sentences.For the S I usually make the lower and upper case s in one stroke and s with two strokes  one for the straight part down and the curve at the bottom and another to make the stroke at the top. I try to leave a bit sticking out of the top to distinguish between the two.For  and  I prefer to make s with open tops to distinguish from s.Zs all get a line through the middle while s do not.For the  vs gt and L vs lt you really just have to pay special attention to angles and try to make the top of  and bottom of L as flat as you can. You can put a line through the  if that helps.Make rs with one stroke by that I mean without picking up your pen and make vs with two strokes draw two lines. Another thing to look out for is writing a lower case Gamma. I try to really separate things so that it doesnt look like an r.I put caps on the tops of I and for lower case I do a really italicized or script version. I make lower case L with a cursive letter if it is a variable. With all of those things I just write the number  with a single line.  Heres  a picture if its hard to visualize! Good luck with your class this year!,Handwriting,ces80i8,3,t5_2swz3

1184964,0,t1_ci2xe50,ampampamp Mbius strip sfw gtgtThe Mbius strip or Mbius band UK mrbis or US mobis German mbis also Mobius or Moebius is a surface with only one side and only one boundary component The Mbius strip has the mathematical property of being nonorientable It can be realized as a ruled surface It was discovered independently by the German mathematicians August Ferdinand Mbius and Johann Benedict Listing in .   gtA model can easily be created by taking a paper strip and giving it a halftwist and then joining the ends of the strip together to form a loop. In Euclidean space there are two types of Mbius strips depending on the direction of the halftwist clockwise and counterclockwise That is to say it is a chiral object with handedness righthanded or lefthanded.gtThe Mbius strip is not a surface of only one geometry i.e. of only one exact size and shape such as the halftwisted paper strip depicted in the illustration to the right. Rather mathematicians refer to the closed Mbius band as any surface that is homeomorphic to this strip. Its boundary is a simple closed curve i.e. homeomorphic to a circle. This allows for a very wide variety of geometric versions of the Mbius band as surfaces each having a definite size and shape. For example any closed rectangle with length L and width W can be glued to itself by identifying one edge with the opposite edge after a reversal of orientation to make a Mbius band. Some of these can be smoothly modeled in dimensional space and others cannot see section Fattest rectangular Mbius strip in space below. Yet another example is the complete open Mbius band see section Open Mbius band below. Topologically this is slightly different from the more usual  closed  Mbius band in that any open Mbius band has no boundary.gtInteresting Fiber bundle | Real projective plane | Mbius ladder | Strange loop Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcixe oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecixe.

Its a simplification of spencerian penmanship to increase speed efficiency and legibility. Used mainly for business such as Secretary work. Some may argue to even learn Spencerian I am an advocate for that however most people struggle with reading such a script nowadays and may regard that as illegible though very pretty.

When you lift your pen then its a good moment to move your paper this way you can keep your hand where its comfortable to write.Finger writing is tiring but retraining to another way of writing requires months to regain speed. Retraining will be hampered by switching between finger writing note on lectures and hand or arm writing in the afternoon.

6514406,0,t3_44hee8,Visually your handwriting looks spatially tidy but I find it somewhat difficult to read for the following reasons All the letters including the capitals at the beginning of sentences are all the same height. If Im trying to read what you are writing sometimes its hard for me to tell where the sentence ends and a new one begins especially if the punctuation is just a period.   Your lowercase ns and your uppercase Rs look nearly identical at first glance. Personally I dislike mixing uppercase and lowercase letters but Id suggest that if you want to continue to do so Id close the middle on the Rs so it is easier to tell the difference.  I notice that your lowercase Ls and your uppercase Is look identical in many spots. I see that you sometimes dot the i but you dont do it consistently which makes it somewhat difficult to read.  Your lowercase as and your os look nearly identical as well. Im an extremely fast reader so some of my critiques may not be the same issues for someone who reads at a slower pace than I do. ,Handwriting,czt52mt,1,t5_2swz3

You should consider rounding your c a bit more. E.g. I found it difficult to read implications. The problem was caused by the c. Also second statement wasnt clear as it looks like seiond statement without the dot on the i.   Your lowercase h isnt clear. E.g. The word The reads as He.

Mum at home helped me write better her hand writing with both hands is amazing and have been slowly trying to improve. Now i can actually read it if i take my time to write things down but... unsure what i can do to fix some of my annoying habits . I write too hard. way to hard sometimes. . I dont have consistent gaps in my words. Come from being told to spread them out more then it not being enough.. tends to come from where i am in my train of thought. . I constantly use capital letters when i shouldnt. Terrible habit. Thanks! ,Handwriting,d38m20q,1,t5_2swz3

7701729,0,t3_4kt19x,I learned Palmer method in school and never really liked it. Over the years I modified to a no slant few flourishes style letters that end on a downstroke like a n at end or word would just stop no finishing stroke. when I was taking my time it was reasonably legible but the faster I wrote the less readable and smaller it got. Lack of use because of computers deteriorated further until I started printing most things. Finding rpenmanshipporn and then this group inspired me to up my own game. I did a bunch of reading and decided on Italic cursive as taught by GettyDubay with my own modifications for certain letters. Been practicing for about  weeks and also just got their writing book for adults Write Now and have started working through that.Whether or not the improvements stick Ive really been enjoying spending time each day practicing. Its very meditative and relaxing. ,Handwriting,d3hmvp0,3,t5_2swz3

Remember when you first learn to drive a carcycle its a conscious effort but gradually as you get the hang of it the action becomes automatic. That automatic is when your subconscious takes over.That means when you consciously keep changing your handwriting it cannot go on the auto mode. It will change to original the moment you allow it to go in the auto mode. So the operative is change yourself and see the change in your handwriting.Have worked hard and for number of years now to achieve a serene neutral non judgmental learner attitude in the work I do.

9852296,0,t3_5gfee1,The story of my handwriting for anyone interested So my friend pointed out the other day that I have a very weird handwriting he was talking about my fancy font. Thats how I was required to write in primary school. After that the school dropped the requirement for that kind of handwriting so I started to make some changes to speed up my note taking and accommodate English words English not being my st language. It eventually evolved to my current handwriting as you see. One thing I found out when I get to Canada is that English speaking people dont really care about how neat your handwriting is. Even though some has complimented me on it but I often find my handwriting too boring and lacking a personality? I tried some of the handwriting analysis but they always ended up with nothing. Like theres nothing to tell from looking at my handwriting. Mostly of the time I feel like my handwriting is not something of my own lol?

The Lamy Safari line particularly has a triangle grip that will bother you a lot at first but help you learn to position your fingers correctly. The advantage of fountain pens is the flowing ink which means that almost no pressure is required to write. It takes a while to get used to it but it alleviates hand pain noticeably for me I have a chronic illness. That said a fountain pen wont magically improve your handwriting so do expect that youll need to practice a lot for it to improve and youll need to consciously focus at relaxing your grip before it becomes a reflex.,Handwriting,ddbl5cu,1,t5_2swz3
