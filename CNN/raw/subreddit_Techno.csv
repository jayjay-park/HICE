3761555,0,t3_33g586,No one here is really answering your question. Techno is a very difficult genre to digest. Its not very accessible and its hard to understand without having experienced it in a club  definitely not universally true but generally. You need a very good sound systemheadphones to enjoy it as the nuances within a song are very subtle. Ipod earbuds arent gonna cut it. Techno also requires a certain commitment to the music. You need to listen deeply and patiently and with an open mind. Theres generally no big hook to draw you you in and keep your attention. The changes are in tone and texture not always in melody. All these things make it somewhat inaccessible to the average listener. As time goes on and people get bored of the formulaic sounds of EDM there will be more and more listeners of Techno in North America.  Its already happening. I saw Adam Beyer and Ida Engberg play to   people in C weather last year in Montreal.  Patience my friend.,Techno,cql1n78,3,t5_2r5uc

5174419,0,t3_3lvhou,I dont need obvious Jazz influences or Afrocuban rhythms whatever that is but Im getting increasingly bored of all that dark industrialinfluenced techno that gets played by seemingly everyone these days. Considering how big the scene is right now theres not really that much diversity in sound. Or at least that is my impression. So yes I agree with him.Btw That reminds me of what Ben Klock once said in an interview. If someone sends him tracks with the description Berghain techno he knows before listening to it that he wont like it.gtgtSo you think some of the music thats called Berghain techno wouldnt even get played at Berghain?gtYeah Im positive about that. I get sent so many promos saying Here this is something for you this is Berghain you will like it. As soon as I read this I know its not for me. It just bores me this so called Berghain techno. ,Techno,cv9phga,21,t5_2r5uc
5229140,0,t3_3mjyga,I mean on the flip side of that look at how many older EDM DJs lead the charge on that front as well. Tiesto Armin Van Buuren. Both genres have their old guard you just see younger guys blow up in the EDM scene because marketing fires them to the front Martin Garrix where as younger Techno guys probably have less of that.Techno is in no way a genre of past generations and has incredibly more depth than the EDM scene to the point where I would say the opposite of your friends statement is likely true. ,Techno,cvgawiw,1,t5_2r5uc

5297033,0,t3_3nk0y6,I thought this a good readand well worth posting. Clone is on my record shop wishlist along with Hard Wax Rush Hour Technique and Recycled Music Centre. Ive never shopped for records outside of the UK.gt If you really love music your taste develops through the years and youll discover new things constantly. I once tried to do the maths about how many records I own and how much time it would cost me to digitalize all of them. The digitalizing alone will cost me more than two years. If you want to listen to everything it will take you one year one and a half year maybe of nonstop listening. Thats not possible right? There are records in my collection that I will never listen to again. I can discover so much new music in my own bookcase that in theory I would never have to buy new music again. But still you keep on buying because you keep on discovering new things.This resonates with me. I have far too much vinyl to ever digitise it all so im not going to bother. Id need to hire  staff to do it round the clock for over a year. I know theres great stuff in my collection ill probably never hear again because I cant ever stop buying new or old music. This is one of the woes of a vinyl lover or music obsessive. Im sure im not alone with this affliction.,Techno,cvor98d,1,t5_2r5uc

8731370,0,t3_4zhb0x,Id like to make the distinction that a set billed as a live set means the DJ is not just standard mixing records heshe is using additional equipment or software in order to create music live or edit tracks on the fly.  This is different than just blending tracks together.In regards to your second question besides song selection yeah different DJs have different styles.  Some blend longer use loops differently some use FX more or less frequently some are looser with their mixing style while some are more precise.  None of these are better than the other and its not even a preference thing for me I like to experience it all.  For example an old school Detroit guy like DJ Bone or DJ Stingray vs. a modern day DJ like Ben Klock or someone like Recondite will be a different experience.,Techno,d6x2f6q,2,t5_2r5uc

On the underground parties in my city people are very respectful and they are there for the experience not to get girlsguys or drink till they pass out actually so respectful and nice that I end up feeling very comfortable going out by myself and just enjoying the music knowing there wont be guys trying to touch me or these annoying groups of people seemingly having the time of their lives while some tiny fireworks blast from their champagne bottles.,Techno,d723tv0,1,t5_2r5uc

9172460,0,t3_55xwfn,In general techno can be a very blurry term. However I think techno according to self acclaimed techno enthusiasts can be narrowed down to a pretty precise genre. On one hand I wouldnt call this track techno because the kick isnt dominant enough the snare is too dominant there is a lack of repetitive elementsand its also a bit slow the ambient section is too long and the vocals are too elaboratedOn the other hand I like to call pretty much any genre of electronic music techno because I think its funny.So to wrap it up call it techno if you want to but I feel like this song definitely clashes with the rest of the posts here. Of course Im just revealing my modest opinion. Discussion is welcome.,Techno,d8eoe64,3,t5_2r5uc
9179549,0,t1_d8fdjyr,It rained constantly this year. Didnt sway the crowd much but it probably kept most phones put away. The promoters also strongly discourage filming and although Ive never seen it enforced there I think most people try and follow the spirit of it.,Techno,d8fkpfj,1,t5_2r5uc

9184765,0,t3_56037f,Relationship of three years fell apart a few years ago and decided to start enjoying my life  went to a local festivalrave and a dj was spinning techno  I went absolutely wild and loved every minute.  Looked up more techno after this.One of the first track that got me hooked was Ben klock  subzero  also dvs  evolve.Had some amazing times watching great djs.I now listen to techno every day and its a massive part of my life I try to go to events as often as possible and Im also heading to Berlin at the end of the month with friends for a techno holiday! ,Techno,d8g8imt,2,t5_2r5uc
9192686,0,t1_d8gwb3u,So that somehow justifies people listening to music for free?!I see this as one more thing deterring people from sources that at least pay the artist some type of royalty. Dont get me wrong I think the idea here is cool. What sucks is it just devalues the work that goes into creating and distributing a piece of music. Even if the end user doesnt rip it from YouTube. They still get to pull a list of music to listen to commercial or ad free with no sort of investment. ,Techno,d8h8og7,0,t5_2r5uc
9197715,0,t3_566h7t,Thats awesome. Thanks for the clarification. Youre correct I did not dig into the site. Im traveling internationally so Im conserving my data. Maybe these are some good points to let other peopleartist know from the beginning? Again my whole point was a concern with making another way for people to get something for free. If this links to actual artistlabels then thats great. It at least gets someone closer to supporting the music. Even if they dont pay maybe they will go see the Music live. ,Techno,d8hvm0x,2,t5_2r5uc

I feel safe going out because the parties I go to are safe places with zero tolerance to any harassment and everyone is really into the music. Im usually just in the front or back dancing hard and I always find people with similar vibes. And sometimes I dont talk to a single person all night.

Im only a bit disappointed that Bart Skils wont be there but the rest looks too good to be true.Also I think the Drumcode stage on Sunday will contrast nicely with that awesomelooking properly dark lineup on Saturday. This is what I really wanted in  some nice and dark techno on Saturday and some melodic andor Drumcodestyle techno on Sunday but last time a lot of the sets on Sunday felt a bit soft.Edit Downvotes because I like Drumcode.
