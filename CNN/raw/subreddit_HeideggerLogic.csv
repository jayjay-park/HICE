6287016,0,t3_41pg97,Thanks for this opening move uabathologist!I think you bring up a good point regarding the absence in Heideggers account of the Contemporary Situation of Philosophical Logic of what we would recognize as the key logical thinkers of this time. A decision is being made here one that probably finds its basis in Heideggers distinction in  between philosophical logic and traditional scholastic logic. My hunch is that despite the innovations occurring within the field of logic at that time Heidegger would still view them as having the same scope and aims of traditional logic  that is the formulation of laws that govern correct thinking.Nevertheless! All of that will no doubt be central to many of the discussions that follow and it would be silly to try to anticipate those discussions. But as a point of clarification I think Heidegger was at least familiar with most of the thinkers you mention and that the omission was a matter of interest as you say.In his Neuere Forschungen ber Logik  translated as Recent Research in Logic Heidegger writes gtgt Gottlob Freges logicalmathematical researches are in my opinion not yet appreciated in their true significance let alone exhausted. What he has written in his works on Sense and Meaning and on Concept and Object cannot be disregarded by any philosophy of mathematics. But it is also equally valuable for a universal theory of the concept. p.  in Kisiel Becoming HeideggergtIn  at least he is showing an appreciation for Freges work. It might be of interest for our project here to note that Heidegger continuesgtgt While Frege overcame psychologism in principle Husserl in his Prolegomena to a Pure Logic has systematically and comprehensively confronted the essence relativistic consequences and theoretical worthlessness of psychologism. Ibid.gtLater in the same essay he devotes several pages to Meinong before assessing the logical system offered in the Theory of Objects as essentially entangled with metaphysics and psychology.There is also a small bit on Russell and Whitehead that is not translated. Ill post the passage below with an attempt at a translation.Further I know that in The History of the Concept of Time Heidegger mentions Brouwer and Hilbert as the key thinkers in the crisis of mathematical foundations p. . Clearly all of these references are either from youthful writings or just passing mentions and I dont know if Wittgenstein is ever brought up. But there was at least some exposure to these thinkers which would lead one to believe that this omission stems from a decision on Heideggers part rather than an obliviousness. ,HeideggerLogic,cz49gyc,2,t5_2w22v
