9616350,0,t1_d9yckm9,Poo from EarthBound would make a good swordsmanthough we have quite a bit of those already. I would love to have Ninten from Earthbound Beginnings but most people think he would look too similar to Ness. A character who would shake things up would probably be Porky but not in a giant spider mecha or anything. Just regular Porky in a business suit with his skin tinted green. I would also be happy with Duster or Kumatora as another Mother  rep. Basically any of the above I would be fine with,SmashBrosSwitch,d9yevj5,1,t5_3h9af
