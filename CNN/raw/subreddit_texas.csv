19190,0,t1_cegjvus,The problem is hes too concerned about being progun  and other people are to concerned about being proguncontrol to look at situations like this objectively. If he was walking around a crowded mall carrying a doublebit ax or an unsheathed machete openly people would wonder what he was doing and some would be afraid he was planning some sort of violence.Guns are tools the same as machetes and axes. They arent fashion accessories or toys to be shown off. The fact that he felt the need to go to a crowded place wearing it with a magazine! as opposed to carrying in a case makes me wonder.

On the same note I am a Christian and I believe that in some certain cases abortion should be allowed. Namely for the safety but not convenience of the mother.Furthermore I am a little confused by what you mean by you and your kind.

Meth labs cost my state a lot of money to clean up and are even worse when they blow up. If decriminalized it just makes things easier for the users but doesnt do anything to hurt the source of the drugs. It would be better if the tweakers could go out and buy meth that has been manufactured in a controlled manner. Not only would it save taxpayers money by not throwing people in jail cleaning labs and fighting fires it would get rid of sketchy drug dealers free up fire and police to do other work and would create real jobs. ,texas,cf5megb,1,t5_2qho4

1775666,0,t1_ck2yjck,Agreed. Were not censoring opinion.For example this is something Ive really seen in the sub if someone writes what do you expect from a bunch of monkeysners thats racist and offensive. Those words are specifically racist and offensive and the comment will be removed. If someone instead writes what do you expect from a bunch of black peoplewe can all agree thats racist. However I wouldnt remove it because the person is expressing an unpopular opinion but hasnt used hate speech or racist terms to make their point.  edit Ok I dont think my follow up sentence accurately portrays a sentence I wouldnt remove mostly because Im not the type of person to write those things and I couldnt think of an accurate example. If something is clearly racist its getting removed.Its a very fine line that mods walk. I dont believe that people should have their opinions censored. Further I think readers have the right to not be victim to personal attacks downvote brigade statements such as go kill yourself you fucking cunt etc... or be subjected to hate speech. It discourages users from commenting or contributing content. Even when the hate speech isnt directed at you its still offensive and degrades the quality of the conversation.In conclusion I agree strongly that opinions should not be censored.

This is normal because fracturing is literally what an earthquake is.Now then can fracking cause bigger earthquakes and how big? Lets say you are fracking near a fault line. At any point along that fault line there is a field of stress which represents the force on the fault line from any direction. If you are pumping waterCO into the ground you may be changing that field of stress which can result in the rock failing and you get a bigger earthquake.In the middle on the continental shelf youre looking at earthquakes around  on the richter scale. Huge earthquakes  can only happen at convergent plate boundaries at shelf margins so no worry about that.TLDR If fracking near a fault line you can get moderately sized earthquakes.,texas,cqkwsck,4,t5_2qho4

The Edwards is a remarkably rapid recharge aquifer with a recharge zone very close to the discharge areas.   From what Ive read we can expect to see the Edwards absorbing some of the recent rainwater in just a few weeks.What worries me is the thought that we arent really looking at a drought that has been broken but rather the new normal of long periods of no rain followed by some heavy rain.

I have no idea if the ready availability of federally recognized outofstate marriage for the past year and nonrecognized outofstate marriage for nearly a decade would mean that there is less demand because early adopters are likely to have already done it or greater demand because marriage has become more normalized for gay people in recent years.But at any rate there are indeed many ways in which samesex relationships are often quite different from differentsex relationships. Its certainly less common for samesex relationships to be monogamous but its also quite a lot more common for nonmonogamous relationships to result in marriage. In my experience as a gay man living in California and now Texas Ive generally found that a similar fraction of my gay and straight friends in ages between  and  are in relationships. Above  its much more common for straight people I know to be in relationships than gay people. Its true that a smaller fraction of the gay ones have gotten married but I dont know that its as low as . At any rate monogamy doesnt seem to be particularly connected to the desire for marriage here.My partner and I certainly never had any particular desire to get married though once its legalized Ill definitely want to look into various legal issues to see if it would be helpful in any relevant way to our situation.,texas,cru8z39,9,t5_2qho4

Here have a warrant for your arrest.It is not against the law to throw people in jail for skipping court.

If he would have told the courtjudge that he couldnt afford the fines in full and provided financial documents like the tax return in the article they would have put him on a payment plan andor even reduced the fines.It really saddens me that people arent smart enough to see that going to jail for a warrant  going to jail because you cant afford to pay the fines.,texas,cvsz1iz,2,t5_2qho4

Im a fan of letting citizens own firearms as long as they can maintain and understand them with a proper education but thats silly. Im trying to imagine if people did have personal weapons in that concert hall and how dark and loud it was. I dont think thats something the general populace would be prepared for with or without a weapon. Which muzzle flash do you shoot at is that flashing light even a muzzle flash or just a strobe? Is someone else going to shoot at you thinking you are the perpetrator? Are you going to hit a bystander? Are you a foot taller than the massive crowd in the dark room with the flashing lights so that you can see over them and fire at the enemy? Did you hit them when you fired? Should you keep firing? Not to mention the sheer amount of alcohol and drugs flying through everyones veins. What I can see happening is some prior service lawmilitary person with a weapon could make their way through it all but even then thats a fucking tossup with that setup. There is a reason people have tactical training for situations like this. A person getting mugged in a park and a large group of people being strategically slaughtered by the dozens are two vastly different scenarios.  Also citizens should be able to carry their own hand grenades the criminals will get them no matter what!,texas,cx17ejr,6,t5_2qho4

5705277,0,t1_cx3grrh,Another way to look at this is with economics. With abortion clinics readily available the demand for these drugs will drop. However this results in the price of those drugs dropping as well. These low prices make it more attractive for women especially in areas of poverty. The flip side  with abortion clinics limited the demand for these harmful drugs increase for women from all levels of income. Thus increasing the price of these drugs and essentially pricingout  the women from lower levels of income.Like any of these kinds of issues there isnt a clear causeandeffect nor is there any clearcut solution. However women amp men should both feel the need to take more responsibility in their actions. I grew up South Texas and a lot of times it felt like teen pregnancy was embraced rather than viewed as a negative thing. More sex education isnt the answer because the schools will somehow find a way to dilute the seriousness of the matter. With the amount of readily available information online it isnt really a necessity.

6723975,0,t1_d0epvam,I disagree with the academic scene compared to the workplace. Bosses and coworkers spend significantly more time with their workers than students do with teachers and classmates by and large. Bosses have interviews sit downs meetings regularly. Profs can go an entire semester and never speak to some students. Thats very different. Profs can have several thousand students that they see twice a week. A CEO may have the same number of employees and only see them once per year. The management sees them everyday. Its a stretch to compare those two situations. Now the eligibility is certainly a factor. Very few students would even be eligible and even then only a small fraction of them assuming  to match CHL rates across the state would even choose to carry. But those odds increase at the graduate and PHD levels. The levels at which they would have more societal impact due to smaller groups more international students etc.My grad class of  had  CHL carriers for example.

That said ... it helps when you can actually pay for a decent lawyer.  The poor have much worse luck here.Even Perrys case that I just linked to was thrown out by the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals  which is the highest criminal court but its not the same as the Texas Supreme Court.In any event being a VIP is what got Perry access to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals in the first place  most people dont get these high level courts to review their cases especially before going to trial.In case you werent aware ... the Supreme Court of Texas handles civil matters.  For criminal matters the Texas Court for Criminal Appeals is the court of last resort in Texas.Paxton will try the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals next certainly.   Keep in mind that all but one of the members of that court are Republicans and it wouldnt surprise me if a few are personal friends of Paxton and that the court has been kind to Perry and Delay in the recent past when others had not.And if that fails I dont see him taking a plea  hed go for trial.  And if that fails hed be back to the appeals courts ...Given his VIP status ... every step of this process comes with a good chance of having things go in his favor and ending the process.

An illegal immigrant isnt defrauding me and they may not be defrauding anyone else unless the way they immigrated was by lying on a visa application.As for fracture and breakdown of law and order we all tolerate lots of violation of laws. How many times have you complained about all the cars illegally speeding and illegally stopping in the crosswalk at a red light?

9831326,0,t1_dao1uk1,gt But is what I didnt realize is that the  degree days last for weeks at a time and it often doesnt drop below  until  or AMYeah I totally get why that would be undesirable. I truly think Ill be fine with it though I much much prefer excess heat to excess cold. Feeling like my feet hands or nose are about to fall off is one of my least favorite things. I also prefer to not wear more than a tshirt and underwear at home if I can get away with it.gt not having a fall season has been very depressing to me. I love seeing the red and orange colorsThat I agree with fall is a beautiful time of year minus the cold. Ill be sad to see it go but I think the upsides outweigh the downsides.gt Im guessing that Florida is similar.Ive been in Florida for Christmas before... perfect beach weather.gt Its just a massive mishmash of expansion in every direction.While Im sure it detracts from the closeknit smalltownvibe of each city its actually very good for housing prices in the long run. It prevents a situation like San Francisco where development is virtually nonexistent but people still want to move there so housing prices skyrocket.gt I wont ever be able to find my K movein ready starter home in DFW so Ive already accepted that Ill need to move elsewhere.Again its funny the diverging perspectives everyone tells me Austin is getting way too expensive dont know much about the DFW market tbh. But I look at the very nice newer  BR houses in the suburbs for k and compare to the tiny s  br houses here for k a comparable house would be k and it just seems cheap as hell to me. I dont think I could justify buying in NoVA unless I made k but in Austin its a totally reasonable proposition on a normal salary. Maybe even a good idea so long as Californians continue to infiltrate bringing California money with them and bidding up prices. Interestingly rents are about  of what they are in NoVA despite the much cheaper housing again making buying seem like the better option.gt driving  minutes to get  milesYeah part of the reason I want to live in Austin is the city center is fairly compact and bikefriendly as is the attitude of the residents I dont feel people would try to run me down as they do in Houston. If I eschew the k big new suburban house for a k tiny fixer upper closer to the city center I shouldnt have to do too much driving. Yes I know the heat can be bad but I tried it in August and felt it was totally doable. Well see I guess. gt somewhere like Kansas City Richmond RaleighAh yeah I gave Raleigh a shot as well but it just wasnt for me. What really befuddled me was the way the bad areas were mixed in with the good areas. I would walk down a random street with nice little br s houses and play guess the housing prices. Check on Zillow afterwards. It was impossible for me to tell if a given house was worth k or k. It was weird.Richmond I havent been to in a while and while when I went it did indeed have the vibe youre looking for from what I hear its more like NoVA now.

11096664,0,t1_depp3e4,Youre right to be suspicious. Tyler Technologies the company with the contract for the public access portal is mentioned in this AG opinion request They currently have a contract with Williamson County for management of local court records. Apparently their software is allowing the public to see criminal record information that is subject to an order of nondisclosure. Tyler Technologies can fix it by changing their software but so far have refused until they get an AG opinion on the matter. That means for months confidential criminal record information has been publicly accessible in Williamson County and Tyler Technologies has been fully aware given an opinion by the Williamson County DAs office and still refuses to do anything. The AG opinion further states the same thing is happening in other counties with Tylers software. Now were supposed to let them open the floodgates statewide?They also refuse to respond to requests for expunctions. The law requires expunged records to be destroyed and as things are currently they are refusing to provide a contact to send orders of expunctions so they can be destroyed. There will be massive privacy issues if this system comes to fruition. Originally when there was just an efiling system and no public access portal they told everyone documents would be deleted after  days so nobody even knew to send those orders of expunction because they thought the documents would already be destroyed. Then they announce that theyve been keeping the documents since January . That means everyone who got an expunction between then and late last year probably still has records out there which are not supposed to be available. And theyre being held by a private company with a history of mishandling confidential information. Harris Countys IT director used to be on the JCIT subcommittee for the project and was kicked off. In the hearing about this bill the Chair of the JCIT specifically said she had not kicked that woman off the subcommittee. Then the woman who was kicked off went up and explained that she stopped getting emails and when she asked if she was on the committee they told her no. Theyre kicking off anyone who doesnt agree with the system as it is. They do not want to make any further attempt to ensure privacy rights are protected. Theyre drunk with power and must be stopped. ,texas,depspji,9,t5_2qho4

11595949,0,t3_65efyb,I disagree that there is little to do in Houston. The museum district there is phenomenal  Id say the Menil Collection and Rothko Chapel are must sees. The food is excellent. There are a multiple famous buildings that architecture schools cover. Houston is about as touristenabled as Chicago but unfortunately not as walkable. Like most cities your son may have more fun coming to HTX once hes of drinking age even though the city has a fair amount to offer at his age.Tbh the NASA space center isnt much. Its definitely not something that takes a day. I feel the need to reiterate that Houstons museum district is truly world class.In Austin Id also budget some time to walk through sixth street at night. Your son will likely spend a lot of time.there if he goes to school in Austin  itll probably be intimidating but very representative of the culture at UT. Drinking is huge for college students in Austin. The schools are great but Austin in general is a party town  wellpaid professionals there drink like college students.Also take some time to hike the green belt in Austin. Its truly beautiful.In Dallas definitely see their arboretum. It is one of the most beautiful spaces Ive seen in my life. Its located pretty close to downtown Dallas so it shouldnt be out of the way.I noticed a lack of private unis on your visitation list. A lot of our private schools are top tier. The list price for these schools are higher but nearly all are generous with financial aid. Id recommend visiting Rice in Houston St. Edwards in Austin and Trinity in San Antonio all great schools. SMU is a well regarded school in Dallas but I transfered out of there to St. Eds after a year because the student culture is toxic  you may want to consider a tour there but proceed with caution. Edit by at night on sixth street I mean about midnight. It doesnt really get going until after . Its a safe area to take your son.Its also worth pointing out that many students dont participate in that drinking culture  theres plenty of things UT and St. Eds students do that dont revolve around drinking. Its just that many students are attracted to the city for its nightlife so its something for your son to consider.,texas,dgaeqs7,4,t5_2qho4
