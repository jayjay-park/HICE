10785118,0,t3_5np5zl,I seem to have an easier time than others telling when people are feeling badupset and understanding why that is before Ive asked how they are. Ive never thought of if it was related to SM but it really might be. Im in college for psychology to be a therapist in the future and its been useful with friends and will be in the future careerwise.Also people tend to have a really hard time projecting tone through text but Ive never had a problem doing that in casual textbased conversation bc Im so used to communicating that way and having to use punctuation and formatting to convey my meaning.,selectivemutism,ddsen8f,2,t5_32qzw
