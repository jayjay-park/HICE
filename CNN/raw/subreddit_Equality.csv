I think perhaps we are confusing mildly insulting with racist. Racism was the slogan No Irish Need Apply. It cost people their lives. This...is chocolate made to look like a potato. ,Equality,cg31dx4,5,t5_2qtp5
1404991,0,t3_2a812v,I like how in a rant about how female gamers get treated he rushes to generalize about male gamers. protip if you want support dont do thisgtId like to see more female proantagonists in more games lead and supports its not hard in looking at you UBISOFT Assassins Creed liberation was about a Female protagonist your seriously telling me it would be to hard to put female playable characters in Unity? really.Such a common decry yet it completely ignores the work that goes into creating a character. Also most RPG games are first and foremost about the story. Some stories are designed as to where gender is irrelevant Mass Effect and Fallout for example whereas others the main character is already fleshed out. Some of these are built from the ground up but others are based on moviesnovelsbooksmyths such as Metro and God Of War and even remakes or continuations of older games such as Wolfenstein New Order. In such situations it would be ridiculous to ask for the option of a female protagonist or similar. The story always takes precedence imo. If you want to complain go complain to the original creators of those stories.gtI find female gamers refreshing because simplyto me its just right that they can play as hard as wemales can. It adds a difficulty spike to the now boring drone video game genres that I used to love so much think about this a whole new enemy with a completely different thought process one who sees way outside the box that one game or day may be an ally.Kind of ironic in this rant for equality that you treat women as completely foreign entities who will play the game entirely differently. In my experience this is not the case at all. gtNo female gamer should be pained or should suffer anxiety before putting on a Mic or picking up a controller what self respecting male gamer has any right to put down any female gamer in any way? You should welcome them to the game with open palms not closed fist.Not sure why the focus is so heavily on female gamers throughout all this though. If youve ever played a multiplayer game with voicechat you know that its not an issue of omg a girl as much as a general bullyingbitchtalk against targets that cant do much back. Theres plenty of guys who get attacked like that too but people seem to ignore that or think its fine somehow.gtFood for thought would you go to a house party that has nothing but dudes? Ill wait Mic dropThen again people often go to parties to hook up or to chat with a romantic interest so not really comparable. ,Equality,cise957,10,t5_2qtp5

4161344,0,t3_37z6kg,Absolute human equality may not be achievable in every circumstance and unfortunately the world is imperfect for example reproduction.  Lets assume that the fetus is not a person for argument sake.  A man currently has no reproductive rights.  His fatherhood is determined by the absolute choice of another.  If she decides to keep the child he is a father.  If she decides to terminate he is not a father.How do we make that fair?  Well obviously if abortion is banned then neither gender has an option after fertilization.  This though disadvantages women because of possession.  She bears the physical costs of bearing the child.We could give her the right to abort and give a man who doesnt want to parent the right to  legally abort.  This still does not address the issue when he wants the child nor does it address the fact that she still bears the physical cost of aborting the child.  Maybe if he pays a sum equal to the cost of an abortion whether she keeps the child or not as his sole and one time financial responsibility to her and the child.Im unsure if you could ever get it totally fair or equal.  If everyone agreed on substantially equal maybe youd have a chance otherwise the groups tend to want to err on the side that benefits their constituency.,Equality,crulpz9,1,t5_2qtp5
4412650,0,t3_3biw4x,I think in this context they are looking at aspects of women and men. Woman being ones to give birth and care for children. Wheres men tend to be stronger and more likely to protect the family. When war arrises I think people go back to their instincts. Equality talks more about societies that are more advanced where a man can care for a child and a woman can be strong. So they want that view to change. I also think that their are probably woman fighting in that war and also small children. You dont really know till you go there. And from what Ive heard it can be very terrible. ,Equality,csn1gmd,1,t5_2qtp5

Trump and pence are not going to usher in a golden era of freedom from religion.Pence isnt just not a great guy hes a full on religious fuckin nutjob whacko that believes in conversion therapy for gay people and that abortion and birth control should be illegal among many other fucked up things.  You might as well have elected a fucking polygamist Mormon to the office of VP. The office of VP does actually mean something BTW and is influential. That creepy dude and his GOP supporters are the ones helping Trump pick his cabinet members because Trump has no fidea what hes doing.Back to Trump... of course hes not going to proclaim alliance with a hateracist group. It would be political suicide. Instead he uses dog whistle politics to say things without openly saying them.Trump being racistDonald Trumps tax recordTrump on labor and keeping jobs in the USTrump isnt putting an end to the latter two. Youre fucking high if you think hes going to side with labor.Youre right about the automization though. Those jobs arent coming back and nothing Trump can constitutionally do will bring them back. But he wouldnt if he could anyway. Companies arent suddenly going to start firing their robots.WAKE. THE. FUCK. UP.YOURE BEING PLAYED BY A CAREER CROOK AND A CARD CARRYING MEMBER OF THE MONIED ELITE.
