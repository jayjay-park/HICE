I see it being the fuckheads who listen to this shit because they think its cool.Many people have to realize that EDM isnt as cultured and refined as it once was. Murica and bros everywhere have gotten a hold and they are going to run with this shit until they die of an MDMA overdose at a fucking Guetta show.Fuck EDM and this dramatic garbage between two fucks who think their shit dont stink.

Even techno will be known as techno techno.Repeat after me ELECTRONIC DANCE MUSIC. Say it again and again and again until you realize what those words mean. Is it made from electronic instruments or sounds? Can you dance to it?  Is it music? You  are right on that second half. Hell most of those same people probably cant name any artists beyond Afrojak Steve Aoki Dead Mau and maybe a few others. That just means they havent realized theres more out there then just the big names and thats one good reason to stay united. New people learn over time and those that dont will realize something isnt right and will leave. Thats not a bad thing without those people becoming famous some people would go oblivious to any of it existing in the first place.

3039965,0,t3_2uzgvl,I never said anything about that whole Heady not taking his time for HWS thing but I really need to get this out now.Heady started HWS as a simple podcast that would make him soon very famous. It was the  Hardstyle podcast and he realized the potential in it so he turned it into this big brand. Would he be where he is today without HWS? I dont know but it helped out a lot. Theres merchandise a HWS tour hell he now even has a freakin Label named after that podcast. Hes probably making a shitload of money of this brand so the very least I would expect from him is take a little bit of time at least once a month and give something back to his fans. Not like it would hurt him or take up a whole week. Its just an hourlong podcast. Now I can understand if he doesnt want to do it anymore because the Hardstyle community has been so toxic towards him and that hes just sick of it. I would very much appreciate a simple statement from him saying that hes moving onto a completely different genre now and people have to deal with it. But that would mean to stop identifying himself with Hard With Style and losing a big part of his fanbase.I dont dislike the direction Heady is going it would just be nice that he is more open about it.

I recommend a chair so u can sit outside but u can buy a lot of camping stuff at the onsite store. I personally brought nothing special last year because I was only in my tent at night and u get to sleep pretty quick after a long day of dancing.I was in a  person tent and it was better than I expected and plenty big enough so Id guess a  person tent is just as good.tips? drink a LOT of water over the weekend! and take some sun cream hopefully u will need it ,hardstyle,cpqt4if,3,t5_2rluz

5544288,0,t3_3qyabd,Ok some notes about this trackQdance sent me a preliminary set up of the stage a giant space wasp on the back of a space shuttle and I went back to that when I was working on the midintro. I really wanted to explore that idea with the robotic sounds and the idea of assemble the machine kept coming back to me. In the build ups of the track youll hear lots of machinery revving up and drilling and stuff.Because Qbase is held at an old military base I also tried to introduce some military overtones by way of orchestral marching snares giant brass hits. I wanted a melody that could be chanted and hummed rather than some floatytoaty melody in a style that has been done a million times before so I drew inspiration from Soviet propaganda to complete the military influence.The actual screeches and noises from the midintro were made through granular synthesis rather a series of detuned saws with pitch envelopes for example the main crow style screech was a choir sample and the other little buzzing things came from pianos.  The main kick is an fact a noholesbarred hardcore kick in the style of Wasted Mind and Destructive Tendencies. I see the next stage of evolution of hardstyle as a merging between it and hardcore so I thought Id take a leap and work with a real hardcore kick rather than the typical raw hollow kicks or the standard CtrlAltDel style kick.I constructed this track with the fireworks show in mind and tried to give the production team a lot of cues to work with which is why theres big stops and bass hits rather than my usual pacey noholesbarredgogogo tracks.Like with all the music I do I knew from the outset this anthem wouldnt be for everyone. That was hard to push past that in the early stages because on the one hand you also want to make a good anthem that everyone talks about for long after the party but on the other hand as an artist you have your own vision and style and way of doing things  and in my case those aspects often oppose each other.,hardstyle,cwkbj6t,11,t5_2rluz

Genres change all the time and thats totally fine but this isnt just some sort of creative evolution its commercialization amp laziness corrupting the genre.    I dont think its gone down the path of house gt big room house or anything that drastic...but its kind of going that way.

6891012,0,t1_d0xby1i,Since I played part in creating the hardstyleonly rule I can explain it  a bit more.It was actually created because of the Heady house tracks! We ultimately decided that Heady wasnt a part of the Hardstyle scene anymore and therefore his tracks arent relevant.  However when a track is not purely Hardstyle but a known producer was involved in it like your submission here! it is still relevant. Now there is always an option to create a self post or post into the weekly Manic Monday thread where we dont have ANY genre rules so you dont need to worry at all about that stuff.tldr You didnt break any rules the post is fine.,hardstyle,d0xewuv,1,t5_2rluz

Thursday night was pretty cool because of the Pussy Lounge stage but even then it was a lot of drunken bs going on in the crowd Pussy Lounge actively encourages moshing and stuff.Honestly though if you can do it do it. I left the Salzburgring last night having totally forgotten about the douchey crowd  all because of how spectacular the QDance stage was. The sets were amazing the production was mind blowing especially because you get . hours of darkness aka LIGHTSHOWS OMG and the sound was better than most of the outdoor stages at Defqon.

11762652,0,t3_67rngy,in italy  of the peole follows the shitty music trends and so hardstyle is mostly unknown.people usually call it hardcorethe only place where theres a minimum hardstyle scene is near Turin because they have some great disco like Shock that are still focused on hardstyle.in my zone there are just some early hardstyle events two or three times a year and its almost always Tatanka from the opening to the closing yes he plays for like six hours or forgotten early hsrdstyle djs and theyre free because instead no one would go lol.the Hardstyle scene here is trapped in  it seems that nothing happened after that i know that for someone this would be good but cmonAlso dunno why in italy Tatanka is way more famous than Zatox.A techno disco in my zone tried to introduce hardstyle three years ago bringing in a month Frontliner Noisecontrollers and Zatox but the response was not good so they returned to techno and to the once a year free Tatanka event.Hardstyle works well with my friend that are mostly epic and power metal listeners i also like that very much it gives me the same hardstyle feeling. ,hardstyle,dgtbqry,6,t5_2rluz
