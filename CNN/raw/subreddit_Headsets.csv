6047814,0,t3_3ybclu,The hyper X clouds are by far better they have fantastic sound quality for the price and a decent mic.,Headsets,cycdg7u,1,t5_2whr0
7448794,0,t3_4h8ojp,The HyperX line is unmatched at the moment nothing is really comparable. So look at either the HyperX cloud or HyperX cloud  even check out the cloud revolver but it may be out of your price range. ,Headsets,d2ovpws,1,t5_2whr0

8378807,0,t1_d5ninrb,Not if he wants awful over powering bass and Xbox  compatibility. The Game One and Zero are pretty much the best but for his requirements something from razer would be terrible and better for him.,Headsets,d5owef2,2,t5_2whr0
8380789,0,t3_4or51k,Ive heard that there was an issue with the surround sound on these also on the G as windows recognized it as a stereo. Do you know if this issue has been fixed?,Headsets,d5p5b2j,1,t5_2whr0
8540287,0,t3_4wk2vs,Our Cloud Core comes with a pole headset splitter.  Since you mentioned your ASUS laptop has a combo jack its safe to assume it is pole compatible. OUr headset should be compatible.  Just make sure to enable it through your sound properties playback and recording devices tab.Let us know once you pick up a pair and well go from there.,Headsets,d693r54,3,t5_2whr0
9447142,0,t1_d9dh862,Cheers! Now you would for sure say that Id have the more immersive and of a higher quality audio experience with games on the PS with the Cloud IIs? I just want to be sure before I do buy it for theres really no way to find a place to test it out myself. ,Headsets,d9dhpps,1,t5_2whr0
9719401,0,t1_dab3uvw,So. Whats the other? Theres USB and what? I have a high end motherboard as of  years ago would the other connection be there? Does the Game ZeroOne comfortable? Because the leather is a little off putting and so is the break down able design. Im not moving Im staying still. So Id prefer stability. I play work for  hours a day on my computer.  days a week depending. Would it be worth just waiting and getting a combo? Are there viable choice other than the Gaming Headset?  how much more would it cost?Edit Thank you forgot to say above thank you  ,Headsets,dab4lgy,1,t5_2whr0
9786998,0,t1_dajeufr,The G is normally more than the Cloud  which is why it isnt very good. But if you can find it lower it fits in. At the price points you have listed you will be paying more for better all around quality. Game One is the best out of them but cost the most and the G is the worst but cost the least. Just choose how much you want to spend and youll be fine with any of them. But if you want the best Mic sound quality build quality and all around performance you have to pay more. ,Headsets,dajgl9k,1,t5_2whr0
10099327,0,t1_dbnw6am,Sorry just trying to understand the issue. So when you plug the cable directly just the single cable of the Core it doesnt work? ,Headsets,dbnyfot,1,t5_2whr0
