Its literally a stones throw from the beach and it is exclusive enough that not everyone in staying in the Bahia complex can use its facilities. Yes you pay a bit more of a premium but the way I see it I dont go that often so its one way I can ensure that I get a really restful week.,r4rCanada,cp1e0ri,1,t5_2sypn
