8729496,0,t3_4zi99m,EBay has pretty much cornered person to person transactions. If it is you selling to everyone else shipping cost will probably eat any profit you intend to make. Used book stores typically only give you like  cents credit on used books for good reason. It is a very slim profit margin on this stuff when all the costs get factored in.It would be an OK passion project if that is what you are looking for. I doubt that there is any money in this for you let alone for charity. Suggestions? If you want to shuffle your collection join a book exchange. ,bookdiscussion,d6wtxdb,2,t5_2tjju
