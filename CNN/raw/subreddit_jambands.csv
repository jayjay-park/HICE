3570159,0,t3_317uq6,One day I am at work listening to the Archive found a show that my wife would really like...drive home honey go to archive.org youre gonna love this live show!  She pulls up the Archive and they had deployed their new layout...I was fucking confused!  She uses a Mac so I thought maybe there was a different layout for different OS but she was using a Chrome browser.  Pulled the site up on my laptop PC and it was the same new layout.  I was shocked.  Now I am not saying that I hate it but I was very surprised despite them announcing the new layout and I am still learning how to navigate the site.  The Archive is still the best source for live recordings that I have found to date I dont see any other site taking its place for me anytime soon. Edit  When I browsed to the Archive this morning it was back to the old layout.  Seems there is some serious BETA testing going on.  Stay tuned!,jambands,cpz84wt,2,t5_2ql65
