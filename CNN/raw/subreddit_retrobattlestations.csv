We already had a real computer at the time so it basically served as a game system for us.  My dad actually pirated Atari cartridges with some of his friends so we had this wacky adapter that wed pop handlabeled ROMs into.Fast forward to last year and my dad brought out a box of my old stuff from the attic at my parents house.  Sure enough there was the Atari  with completely melted keyboard.  It had been sitting vertically and the keys had all melted and slid to the front right corner.

615161,0,t1_cga6mng,Internal codename for the  was Carl Sagan.  The name became public via a magazine article about the computer.  Things followedgtIn  engineers at Apple Computer codenamed the midlevel Power Macintosh  Carl Sagan after the popular astronomer in the hope that Apple would make billions and billions with the sale of the computer. Apple used the name only internally but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease and desist letter. Apple complied but its engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to BHA for ButtHead Astronomer.Sagan then sued Apple for libel in federal court. The court granted Apples motion to dismiss Sagans claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand Apple was clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way and that It strains reason to conclude that Defendant was attempting to criticize Plaintiffs reputation or competency as an astronomer. One does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase butthead. Sagan then sued for Apples original use of his name and likeness but again lost and appealed that ruling. In November  Apple and Sagan reached an out of court settlement and Apples office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that Apple has always had great respect for Dr. Sagan. It was never Apples intention to cause Dr. Sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern. Apples third and final code name for the project was LaW short for Lawyers are Wimps.,retrobattlestations,cga71a2,9,t5_2xd38

These are pretty cool machines and really helped SGI get popular  these machines were extremely well regarded. Spec is pretty decent for an Indigo RK MHz MB RAM GRXZ GraphicsSkins are in very reasonable condition though the door wont latch shut.

So for the princely sum of ... I have a fully working system that is complete bar the battery and the HDD cover.So what did I get for ? Well it has a  MHz Pentium MMX a fairly standard MB Chips amp Technologies F GPU a .GB HDD out of my parts bin MB of RAM and a . dualscan x screen. This model also features the OPLx sound chip that audiophiles love  and when you crank the bass up it has some of the best speakers of ANY laptop Ive ever used. Its a little temperamental particularly when it comes to the USB port to be expected for an older laptop with a weird proprietary Toshiba AIS  chipset whatever that is but Ive seen worse. Even the CMOS battery still takes a charge although I really do need to leave the system hooked up for  hours or so to see how good it is.But doesnt the dualscan screen make it unusable for gaming I hear you ask? Well in a word no. Whilst you wouldnt want to play a twitch shooter on one racing games like Monster Truck Madness are fine and when youre playing Age of Empires II like I am in this picture for which this meets the minimum requirements and no more you barely notice the typical dualscan flaws at all.

7421476,0,t1_d2lh8su,From the articles comments section by MikeHerbstgt Conditional Access  basically a dongle card that responds to a security challenge with an appropriate response. Lots of different systems in place Satellite and Cable Boxes use modern versions of these but the basic idea is that it can respond with an appropriate pseudorandom code value or even a set of carefully output random analog voltages for the really old ones.gt In this case the Factory DOS software Cars ECU and Laptop are all part of an integrated system that will only let the software talk to the cars ECU IF that CA card is present and provides the correct response. Its hardwarebased copy protection for the very important factory ECU software.gt These days CA for industrial software is typically handled with a USB key look on the side of a CNC mill Autocad box or similar engineering system and you may see a variety of colored USB thumb drives sticking out. Theyre all dongles that enable various bits of software. If your license expires the software stops working and after you pay the company will FedEx you a new dongle.,retrobattlestations,d2lruv2,7,t5_2xd38

None of that matters if the machine is behind a modern NATFirewall which most everyone has these days. Even cable and DSL modems have NAT and firewalls built into them these days They didnt  years ago. If you plugged a computer directly into a cable modem for instance they your computer was given athe public internet IP address and your computer was directly exposed to the internet with no firewall. Bad times.. I have  different Wink boxes that Ill turn on occasionally for vintage gaming or software work.

9194939,0,t3_56992z,Chances are that if its DB  its standard RS. If you can get access to an oscilloscope in any way that will help a lot in trying to determine baud rate settings. Baud rate is likely set by  of the switches if I had to guess with the other  designating how handshaking works half duplex mode number of stop bits that sort of thing. Youre very much probably limited to guess and check in this kind of scenario. Like I said getting a scope hooked up to the TX pin will tell you if youre getting data out and at what baud rate but if you dont have one then you dont have one. It might be possible to attenuate the signal some and feed it into a sound card though.Also dont throw away that dynabyte computer before trying to give it away if you were not considering trying to fix it.

She bought a MacBook Pro and never took it out of the box because she was intimidated by the idea of learning to switch from Windows. I would guess its still in her closet untouched. ,retrobattlestations,de13lb5,2,t5_2xd38

11444776,0,t3_63b8bm,A wonderful discovery and haul. Glad that it is in good hands for now. Although whoever stored it. Seemed to not care very much. Or was in a hurry. I would have wrapped it all in plastic. As I imagine many of you would do the same. It would be interesting although unlikely. If someone came forward to explain the history. But it looks pretty much how you explained it. Some guy just dropped it in there. And for whatever reason. Stopped payment on the storage locker. Is he alive? Abroad? Too bad that you can not keep it all. Quite an amazing find. I feel that this sort of thing will become more common in the years to come.  ,retrobattlestations,dft970e,1,t5_2xd38

11472628,0,t1_dfw8o4f,Oh god the inevitable keyboard comment. I hope you were speaking about the keyboard community and not yourself. Ill interpret it that way.Each time I respond I get less diplomatic.To me people who obsess about keyboards when there is so much else about a machine to appreciate are losers at best and ivory poachers at worst.This is not a Symbolics specific issue I have seen people throw out rare Otrona attaches Xerox daybreaks Sony NeWS machines etc. after retaining the mediocre keyboards.To many keyboard collectors orphaning machines is an acceptable way to attain the keyswitch of the week.Its like pouring out bottles of wine to collect corks.As someone who has invested considerable time money and engineering effort including many actual getonaplaneandsendbackapallet rescue trips to preserve this insanely complex poorly documented and unreliable genre of system I cant help but die a little inside when people fixate on the dumbest most indestructible part the fcking keyboard.

11633505,0,t1_dgejo27,gt There is a fundamental reason why Android is the most popular Linux distro and why OS X is the most popular Unix desktop.Thats because everyone has a smartphone Apple chose to buy out NeXT and use their OS as a platform to make a new version of MacOS and most people dont use Unix on their desktop I.e. there are more Apple users than people who install Unix on their desktop. I dont see anything of particular value there much less than anything fundamental.    I agree that there are too many Linux distros with little apparent difference beyond the desktop environment. However I dont think Android particularly special. Google could have invented their own OS probably and still been dominant in the smartphone market.    What I see as more important is that the notion of customizing your operating system creates far too much complexity and knowledge requirement even for a relative power user. Being able to tweak it is great but having to choose between untold number of tweak sets at install time is a royal pain in the ass and you end up having to pick between a small number if you want security patches and trustworthy version updates or else handle all that yourself or just stay at whatever version you started with.,retrobattlestations,dgeo55a,1,t5_2xd38
11648864,0,t1_dgfmv8w,Are you sure you have the sound blaster on an unusedfree IRQ?A  address I  Interrupt Request Line D  DMA Channel  low DMAH  High DMA channel P  also an address I believe T  Type  sound blaster sound blaster  ISAIs it possible you have another device on IRQ ? IRQ  was usually reserved for printer  LPT  Parallel port. If you disable your parallal port you could try using IRQ for the sound blaster card and see if that fixes the issue.Im betting the windows crashes are IRQ related.. but who knows.Have you tried turning off Plug and Play OS and see if that helps? Im pretty sure the Sound Blaster  isnt plug n play you have to manually configure the AddressIRQDMA channels and turning off Plug n play OS YES in BIOS might help too.IIRC there are jumpers on the sound blaster to let you configure the addressIRQDMA settings or there is a sound blaster utility to run cant remember anymore been too long.,retrobattlestations,dggevdr,1,t5_2xd38
