It could have been messed with while the bodies were being put in the body bags well never really know. I feel like its pretty safe to assume that it is Erics eye considering how he shot himself.EDIT Here is the only source I was able to find which gives a bit of a better description than I did involving the state of Erics eye after the gunshot. It still doesnt necessarily confirm anything but I figured Id share.,Columbine,cyioegy,1,t5_2wh5j

10762903,0,t3_5oo5tj,Im the same age as Eric and Dylan and I remember what a huge hell high school was. I remember feeling like I wasnt going to amount to anything and everything was shit. But once I got to tertiary education I realised adults are much more chill than high school and things looked brighter.At a more basic level I sometimes think that Eric and Dylan had put their nbk plans onto action a month before they would have graduated well about that I was listening to a podcast today that said Dylan was a junior. I thought Eric and Dylan were both seniors? Im not American so IDK from school and Dylan would have gone on to university.Eric I know he was knocked back from the Marines but surely he could have weaned off luvox and reapplied? From what I know of their planning Eric didnt seem like not getting into the Marines was a precipitating favorrite because theyd been planning nbk for almost a year. And I know theyd really been building up and that sort of bluster and planning is hard to back down from. But if they had put nbk on ice then they would have seen that life isnt quite so shit outside of the microcosm of high school. Or maybe not.I am inclined to also think about things like if Eric and Dylan hadnt shot up Columbine how would the world benefited from the skills and talents of those who died?  But I also think that that level of rage displayed by the boys in the transcripts of the basement tapes that Ive read would have needed to go somewhere. So I think Dylan would have suicided but maybe murdersuicide if hed gotten into a relationship at some point. And Eric IDK. Maybe they would have ended up being well adjusted adults?,Columbine,ddq43yc,2,t5_2wh5j

He had to deal with his own problems he was always the new guy at a school because his family had to move often because of the job of his father. So he didnt had much friends and in high school he got bullied. I think he was insecure too and had mental issues. All this together mixed up with the hate he felt for the high school got him into a situation where he got so hateful he couldnt think about anything else then just destroying the school. Thats my opinion about Eric. ,Columbine,de75oed,2,t5_2wh5j
