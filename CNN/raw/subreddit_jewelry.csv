129051,0,t3_1vk6t1,tungstenwhite tungsten carbide seems to be your best bet non conductive fairly scratch resistant and shatters. Cobalt chrome could be an option it wont stretch or anything but if you need to remove it in an emergency say swelling from a broken finger it has to be cut off the ring not the finger. Ceramic could be an option but it shatters very easily more so than tungsten if you drop it at all it will break. ,jewelry,cet4lpi,3,t5_2qkpi

Sapphire is a great center stone because of its hardness and the pale yellow is very pretty!Quality and clarity do apply to stones other than diamonds. Sapphires are often graded on a more general scale AAA being the highest quality but should also note a clarity like SI slightly included or VS very slightly included etc. You can learn more about the clarity grades hereNatural and naturally colored sapphires tend to be more expensive and there are heat treated sapphires that are treated to enhance or alter color that are less expensive. Its likely that the more inexpensive stones youre finding online are synthetic or heat treated.Aside from online shopping you can contact local jewelers who could help to source one for you theyll know their stuff and be asset as far as discerning quality and value and youll also likely be able to see the stone before committing to and purchasing it.

3949587,0,t1_cr633l6,I second this information. Green Quartz is very inexpensive but the mounting is where the real cost is unless it is made of sterling silver. Take a good look at a few and then make your decision from there. And I mean take a look at a few from different jewelers not online.For the chain look at it. Feel it. Run it through your fingers if its a smoother chain like a box chain snake chain or a wheat chain. If you feel a bump in it as it passes through your fingers pass on it. Look how the chain is soldered to the jump rings on either end. Ask if the jump rings are soldered close. Operate the clasp. Only buy a chain with a lobster clasp. Spring ring clasp are difficult to hold and operate behind your head. Try it yourself. Ask to see a chain and try to clasp it closed behind your head. Try it. And not with your eyes closed in front of you. Do it right! Imagine her mornings when she has to put that on in a rush. The easier you make it the more shell wear it and enjoy it. Now make sure that the chain fits through the pendants bail. Sometimes the chains jump ring opposite of the clasp end can be reshape into an oval so it can shimmy through easier. This may also help when holding it to clasp it.Best of luck kid.,jewelry,cr6hj8u,3,t5_2qkpi

6380225,0,t3_41v2az,My engagement ring came from Rosados Box on etsy and its beautiful. They have a specific section of their shop with diamondfree engagement rings. This ring has a classic engagement ring look  and there are others that would be under your price limit. The only issue is that their matching plain wedding bands are more than  so youd have to buy it somewhere else. Heres one I think would match well with the ering above   The shop it comes from doesnt have as many reviews but the thickness of the band . mm would match the ering better than the other ones I found that were  mm thick. ,jewelry,czev399,1,t5_2qkpi

Not only was I impressed by the fact their collection had managed to collate so many styles and trends under one brand not forgetting the majority of the range is genderless but also the way in which the individuality of the company was immediately visible. My mother was elated with the Fiyah gifts we got her for Mothers Day and as if we werent already impressed by the quality and styling as well as the unparalleled customer service we received Fiyah wrote back to us shortly after to ensure we were happy with our products and even offered us a  off voucher to be used on future purchases for family and friends!

7775607,0,t3_4lottw,Can you contact the original jeweler and ask what their alloy is? Rose gold should not contain nickel. Rhodium plating is a nice solution but you may want to know whats in the metal in case there are further problems. Plus it would not solve adjacent fingers from becoming irritated unless you plate the whole ring. Do the fingers on either side of the ring finger have a similar reaction? Some people find that their body chemistry doesnt work well with certain metals and copper can be a big one for this. In fact I wonder if you could just be allergic to copper  nickels are  copper and its a major component of rose gold.Also do you happen to have pics? It sounds like a unique ring. ,jewelry,d3q0upn,1,t5_2qkpi

8756344,0,t1_d6xhpe6,I agree white gold or rhodium plating a solid gold piece is not a great option especially for a ring which is exposed to a lot more wear and tear and tends to wear down plating a lot easier. If you like sterling silver you could probably have it remade in this metal and have the stones reset pretty affordably since silver isnt a super expensive material.,jewelry,d7079e5,1,t5_2qkpi

10581681,0,t3_5rfqcn,Ive designed and developed private label costume jewelry for years and I can provide some info that may help the decision a little easier. The usual markup is x so if something costs  its about  worth of materials and labor. If you do decide to buy it keep it as youd keep your fine jewelry or maybe even better. I buy antitarnish cases from the container store put my costume pieces in plastic bags with antitarnish strips and away from light and humidity. The really special ones get put in my velvet lined wood box with the fine stuff. Ive seen Miriam Haskell pieces from decades ago in great condition because of the way they were kept. If youre really serious about buying a good piece of jewelry though I would stick to semiprecious stones and real metals for real archivability. If there are any gemjewelry shows in your area I totally recommend going they are feast for the eyes and devastation for your bank account but I recommend it nonetheless. I have bought almost all my fine pieces from the shows and saved x the amount of each one doing so. ,jewelry,dd7f32b,5,t5_2qkpi

11434166,0,t3_637wh8,Without seeing pictures of your stone hard to say how they compare.  The second stone you linked to is not that great  weak color and HUGE window bad cutting.  The ring from Fred Meyer  again hard to say as I dont think the stone pictured is an actual stone looks like a CAD cant see the actual thing being purchased though I have poor vision and could be wrong.  That ring is also very light the band width is very narrow so probably not a hefty ring that would last the way a good engagement ring should.Im guessing you overpaid but from what Ive seen BE offers better quality stuff than what you linked to. The stone isnt the most fantastic aquamarine Ive seen but its better than the second link.  ,jewelry,dfs1uta,2,t5_2qkpi
