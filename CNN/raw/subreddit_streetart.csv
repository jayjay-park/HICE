That said its a little dangerous as an artist to assume your audience are all zombies bowing to the corporate gods.  We know that ads are lame.   I would just prefer to replace the ads with something beautiful or creative rather then just more ads on top..  ads that are saying ads are bad annoys me.  Its happening right now in our election process.  It helps Trump just as much to receive criticism as to get praise.. the negative is just reinforcing his presence and spreading his name farther and farther.  And yes its a proven technique.  Trump is just one example.  ,streetart,cy50mm5,1,t5_2qvd5

Im strangely reminded of the response about the person whose grandmother had a pet cow and when the kid was eating a burger and asked where the cow was his mother calmly and with sensitivity told him that he was eating the pet cow. The takeaway from that comment was that his mother never shied away from being truthful to him even though it was a sticky subject.

9286859,0,t3_57mmn9,When McDonalds Corp. recently introduced a grungy graffitithemed dcor to restaurants across its European market the company hailed the new design as exciting and fresh.Graffiti artists have a different description for the burger chains fauxgraffiti plastered walls copyright infringement.The design scheme officially titled Extreme in McDonalds brochures is meant to target youthful consumers by using graffitilike visual language on the walls to remind people that McDonalds is a brand of the streets as the companys former chief brand strategist for Europe explained.What McDonalds may not have anticipated is that the street is undergoing its own branding revolution. Artists who view the urban landscape as a giant canvas are no longer outlaws in the dusk but are increasingly showcased in museums and galleries and pursued by deeppocketed art buyers. The embrace of graffiti has made artists more possessive of their designs more sensitive to their reputation and along with the higher stakes more inclined to sue.McDonalds is the defendant in the latest of a growing handful of graffiti copyright clashes. In one recent case the plaintiff is the former girlfriend of the late rebel artist Dash Snow. The suit accuses McDonalds of painting him as a corporate sellout and putting his legacy at risk.Jade Berreau the administrator of his estate and mother of his only child alleges that hundreds of McDonalds restaurants across the globe are adorned with replica images of SACEthe tag or signature used by Mr. Snow. He died in  at the age of .Mr. Snow the lawsuit says would never have consented to what it calls a brazen misappropriation of the Soho artists original graphic expression.Nothing is more antithetical to Mr. Snows outsider street cred  says the complaint filed last week in Los Angeles federal court than association with corporate consumerismof which McDonalds and its marketing are the epitome.McDonalds said its graffiti dcor which also includes scrawl on hanging light fixtures is one of a dozen interiordesign motifs recently introduced as part of a broader reimaging of stores. A company spokeswoman declined to comment on the litigation.A similar infringement action was brought against the company in March by Eric Rosenbaum a Los Angeles tattoo artist also known as Norm. He alleged in federal court there that McDonalds ripped off a graffiti work he titled NORM Fire Escape on Bartlett over boardedup windows on a vacant Brooklyn building.Mr. Rosenbaum said he spotted an image that looked suspiciously like Norm on a wall at a Tokyo McDonalds several years ago. Similar tags or letters in graffiti parlance are splashed on McDonalds walls in France and London too.Mr. Rosenbaum doesnt object to the commodification of his work. Since  Norm has been a street artist for hire his complaint says listing companies such as CocaCola Co. and Rockstar Inc. as past employers.The problem his lawyers contended was that McDonalds alleged unauthorized use of Norm stained his reputation and caused the artist to lose several sixfigure licensing deals and contracts.Mr. Rosenbaums lawyers withdrew the lawsuit in May. They declined to elaborate.The plaintiff in the Snow case meanwhile appears to be digging in.Our highest priority is securing the immediate removal of this artwork from all McDonalds stores to prevent any further trauma to Dashs family or his legacy said Jeff Gluck the lawyer representing Ms. Berreau.Art dealer Jeffrey Deitch former director of The Museum of Contemporary Art Los Angeles said some street artists are so antiestablishment that they refuse to allow their work to be displayed at all. Others he said are more amenable and will work for a corporationif they feel the project has the right attitude and authenticity. Commercial misuse can be morally offensive to them said Mr. Deitch.An early booster of the genre Mr. Deitch while at MOCA cocurated a major exhibit of graffiti and other street art. In New York he invited Mr. Snow and collaborator Dan Colen to turn his Grand Street gallery into a giant hamster nest.Mr. Snow a scion of arts aristocracy he was a greatgrandson of FrenchAmerican arts patron and oilindustry heiress Dominique de Menil acquired a reputation as the  Kurt Cobain of the New York gallery world.As a teen he roamed subway tunnels and rooftops snapping Polaroids and spraying his SACE tag. His photographs collages and sculptures often contained scabrous images of sex and hard drugs or featured his own body fluids.Some art critics see Mr. Snow as a shockmongering poseur. His admirers say he effectively captured a post sense of angst and doom. Museums like the Whitney in New York and Londons Saatchi Gallery have also promoted his work. One piece a defiled New York Post cover of Saddam Hussein sold for  last month at Sothebys. Other Snow works have commanded six figures.Mr. Snows mystique also extended to his reckless lifestyle which ultimately doomed him. In July  his family confirmed reports that he had died of a drug overdose.The perceived association with McDonalds has diminished the value of Mr. Snows work Ms. Berreaus complaint alleges. In a statement made through her lawyer she said that suing was a last resort.Ms. Berreaus lawsuit alleges straightforward copyright infringement.But proving that may not be so simple said Christopher Buccafusco an intellectualproperty scholar at Cardozo School of Law in New York who isnt involved in the case.For Ms. Berreau to prevail he said shell have to show that McDonalds interior designers copied the SACE logo and also prove that the tag in question possesses an originality distinguishable from generic graffiti.Courts and the U.S. Copyright Office have been pretty resistant to the notion that the design of letters is copyrightable the professor said.If McDonalds prevails that wont guarantee a win in the court of public opinion. The company was on the defensive earlier this year when a Brixton location in South London got a graffiti makeover.Some residents saw it as misguided pandering. In an innercity area like Brixton tagging is a bit of blight said Jay Rayner restaurant critic for Londons Observer and longtime Brixton resident. While he admires some graffiti in the area as fantastic he deems McDonalds indoortagging to be just a bit crass.A McDonalds spokeswoman defended the aesthetic saying that the new look had been generally well received. ,streetart,d8t6cyu,8,t5_2qvd5
