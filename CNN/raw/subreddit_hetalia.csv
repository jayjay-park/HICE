2398153,0,t1_cm801ei,Not a fandom war per se but Id rather not see a fandom blend in terms of subreddits.Keep homestuck to homestuck and hetalia to hetalia that way fans who like one but not the other can view the fandom they want.For example I couldnt give a toss about homestuck so my vote is for keeping it away from the things I do like by having separate subs for each.,hetalia,cm84bei,2,t5_2sfi6

9519049,0,t3_5b6xrc,I will say yes its really worth getting into I would recommend it in Japanese with subtitles but what version you like more is a matter of taste is a really great series and even if we the fandom can get a little to crazy at times even for anime fans the voice actors in both original Japanese and the English dub are really good and sound like theyre enjoying it the characters are great with great attributes and flaws and the history is surprisingly really goodwhat little story there is that is in general is a great anime with some of the most catchy ending songs there are. And the character songs are really good as well.,hetalia,d9mfbub,5,t5_2sfi6

10555221,0,t3_5qy6o5,Russia used to be my least favorite among the eight Axis and Allies members and though thats probably still true mostly because I like the rest of them more Ive warmed up to him too pun not intended but Ill take it. Hes just a weird sort of intimidating manchild a genuinely lonely guy looking to make friends but hes large and intimidating on top of not knowing his own strength and general creepiness. I dont know how well that translates into historical Russia I know basically nothing about Russian history but it generally seems like a pretty good play off of the normal stereotype of an intimidating scary giant since he fits the physical description but his personality is a mix between creepy and playful.I especially like his relationship with Ukraine. Belarus Im less fond of but sibling relationships are always interesting. For one it allows two characters to become very close without people romantic undertone usually. But aside from that both of them genuinely care for each other even as they dont interact too much. ,hetalia,dd4jxde,4,t5_2sfi6
10812243,0,t3_5shqzc,One part I listen to this guy named platinum speed do various voices from some anime what is that about? one part I got into a conversation with some person cosplaying someone called Italy in a green dress at RealmsCon what is that about? one part languages and history fascinate me and one part news is depressing me maybe national personifications acting goofy will relieve my stress.,hetalia,ddv7g26,4,t5_2sfi6

The amnesia theory is a bit farfetched but it seems as though everyone thinks its  true...but hes blonde with blue eyes!coughcoughFranceAmericaCanadaMonacoLiterallyeveryonecoughcoughBut he remembered Italy as a child!Well maybe theres a portrait or something that someone had hint HRE and he saw it. Not everything means something!But...its cute!...Shit.You got me there.,hetalia,detansi,4,t5_2sfi6
