249089,0,t3_1wx0h9,As far as nightclubs I had a great time at Anjelique. Check out the clubs in Bebek. Lucca was fun but very packed. There also was another place around there that we went into but didnt stay that looked really interesting. Cant think of the name though. ,istanbul,cf6kls5,1,t5_2qmhq

Turkish people are really friendly in the tourist areas maybe a bit pushy but theyd be delighted to sit down and have some tea and chat with you.

Had absolutely nothing to do with reality. Policemen had moustaches and drove around in  model cars. Chase scenes through street bazaars knocking over claypot stands with shopkeepers wearing fez. F that director. I used to like Liam Neeson but he lost my respect after starring in that one. Anyways happy to help with any questions as a local shoot a pm.,istanbul,ctldbff,2,t5_2qmhq

I think AsmaliTaksim area is your best bet to scope out. But most places that dont play rock or top  seem to be more into industrial EDM or the Goatrance sound.I would find out whos DJing at Babylon and as well look at clubs like Beat Peyote or Indigo all off istiklal,istanbul,cynybiq,4,t5_2qmhq

10286644,0,t3_5n5wx6,First of all keep in mind that nowadays the flights tofrom Ataturk Airport are delayed. Since the museums will be closed when you are in Istanbul your options are limited. Regarding historical landmark I recommend you to see Theodosian Land Walls in the district of Yedikule from outside that are standing for more than  years and it is incredible. It is quite close to Ataturk Airport.For a good food you should go to Uludag Kebapcisi located in Florya that is very close to Istanbul Ataturk Airport. Thats where I go to eat if I have layoverlong delay at Istanbul Ataturk Airport. ,istanbul,dca1pzr,2,t5_2qmhq
