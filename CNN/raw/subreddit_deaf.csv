274328,0,t3_1x7fnu,Of course there are Deaf puns! In English there are many words that have multiple meanings. In ASL these multiple meanings can be represented with a different sign. For example the word RUN has many meanings run a business run for fitness runny nose these would be represented differently in ASL. So you would replace the correct term with a wrong one on purpose to be punny. You can also use the concept of signs and an English word and put it together for humor. For example the sign for UNDERSTAND is flicking your pointer finger once near the side of your face. To make a pun someone could do the sign for STAND and sign it upside down.,deaf,cf972us,2,t5_2qi0j

It is a fastpaced social environment and its hard to keep up. I do have a couple of tips for you.Tip .  One thing I discovered was that I needed to dismantle some of the walls I had thrown up.  I had coke bottle glasses a huge mullet and wore the daggiest clothes possible. My mentality was I want someone to like me for me not what I look like. Bullshit! I was  lonely and depressed. Id cry myself to sleep at night.  For NYE I went total makeover  haircut contacts new wardrobe. It was like a rebirth. I started getting lots of attention. And my confidence went through the roof.Tip . Ask for favours. One of the things known by psychologists is that asking for help from someone actually makes them like you more. It sounds weird but its true. Unfortunately I didnt learn this until recently but I wish I could tell my younger self this. So dont be afraid to ask for help. For example instead of saying to your friends I dont like that place lets go to this place ask them I really struggle to hear in that place. Can you help me by going to this other place instead?  you might be quite surprised by the difference.Ill stop there before I go on too much. So yeah hang in there. It gets better. From  and painfully lonely to  and working  and engaged  and single again lots of clubbing and lots of dating!  and traveling the world to  and married and now  kids later. My social life now is good friends quiet cafes relaxing picnics good conversations. Sure I still have the odd sense of feeling left out.  But nothing like in my teens.

2709275,0,t3_2qxrlr,Oh hey friend. I was born with profound unilateral hearing loss in one ear. I think I can help. First off trust me the frustrations with speaking with hearing people don go away just because you were born with it. The thing is my hearing friends are more than happy to accommodate my hearing needs.I need closedcaptioning for shows I got really good at lipreading so I spend part of group conversations lipreading and could you repeat yourself makes you feel less stupid than saying what all the time just fyi. Loud spaces dont necessarily get easier I just have developed endurance in handling them. Which is really good because I work as an assistant preschool teacher and it can get LOUD. Thats part of why I developed the could you repeat yourself method rather than what because kids feel less like theyre doing something wrong if you ask them to repeat themselves. The best advice I can give you is learn to situate yourself so your good ear is on the side of group conversations. It may weird your friends out at first but if you explain yourself theyll get it. If they dont theyre crappy friends. I was born with unilateral hearing loss. I have been in  separate choirs have learned to play  separate musical instruments have been in two operas two musicals and have gone traveling around the country to compete with my choir. I listen to music of all genres all the time. The leftright equalizer is your friend. Listen with speakers and situate yourselfyour speakers so its on the side of your good ear. If youre in a bandchoirensemble learn to speak up. Most hearing people are more than willing to accommodate you and your hearing needs they just have to know what they are. My friends and old choir director only have been needed to be reminded a few times before it just became secondnature to accommodate me. Good luck in adjusting. I know this must be difficult. I hope my advice was valuable!,deaf,cnc1830,3,t5_2qi0j

The best thing you can do right now is not borrow trouble  you may lose some hearing you may not and you shouldnt obsess over the possibility since that will make you miserable regardless of the outcome. Beyond that a good attitude will do wonders  much easier said than done for many people but there are many things that could happen that I would consider a far worse fate than losing my hearing so it really doesnt bother me very much and I do my best to take the occasional difficulties in stride. Being wellinformed is another good idea  there are many options for people who lose their hearing partially or completely and while not all may be available to you knowing your options for the future can help you feel more in control of your situation and ease some of your anxiety and stress. ASL classes lipreading classes hearing aids BAHA CI videophones vibrating alarm clocks visual alarms  there are many things that could help you should you need it in the future depending on your situation and personal desires.

I have also been recommended cochlear implants but Im not looking at that since I am able to get by with the aids. You should absolutely get hearing aids they will help and going by my personal experience they arent just a little help they are essential. It is very different from turning up the volume on a speaker  for one modern ones can amplify only a specific range of frequencies depending on how they are programmed which allows you to avoid painful amplification of sounds you can already hear well. Im not sure why your audiologists are against the aids for you but I would suggest you keep looking for someone who will agree.That said even with hearing aids you might still have to ask people to repeat themselves I know I do but the overall experience is very worth it.,deaf,cs7c7jo,2,t5_2qi0j

But an area theyve generally overlooked and one thats becoming a very hot topic now is wearable aids. Basically things that dont go into the ear canal but sit on the body delivering auditory information via other senses mainly touch and sight. These kinds of prototypes often seen to trickle out of universities and art projects but they never seem to get commercialised because they dont have the industrial engineering experience.

6979794,0,t3_4b8lc2,uocherthulu gave a pretty good response. So instead of trying to outword him Im just gonna point at stuff for you to look at. Is sound the only possible medium for music? I would argue no. Consider how the brain processes languages. It processes the patterns not the medium although medium differences leads to different uses and eventually different cognition processing. Likewise there are still visual noises. Gaudy colors flickering light sudden movements. Those will distract a Deaf person so they will usually control their environment to minimize visual noises.Another thing thats said about Deaf people is that they have no sense of rhythm. Again rhythm is actually independent of medium. Consider this true silent poem.I adore Christine Sun Kim. Look around for more interviews with her seems like she drops some interesting bits every interview.Unrelated to Deaf consider the influence of environment on the formation of language and music. Great book that touches on this would be The Spell of the Sensuous. Great interview of the author.Does true silence exist? I dont think so not for Deaf people not for even Deafblinds. It only exists in the abstract. I think the only way to experience true silence would be to do some intense mediation. Or die... Maybe.,deaf,d17hy0t,3,t5_2qi0j

Most social network services have conference video call features these days.. In response to the assertion that Facebook is written in English indeed reading relatively short snippets of text is more convenient than watching a video at least for the sorts of things that a person might choose to express on Facebook. Still theres nothing stopping anybody from recording a video message on Facebook or uploading a video to YouTube and linking it on Facebook.. Another issue is that not all sign languages are the same much less the writtenspoken languages in every place around the world. An international site would need to account for this set up groups per language per country per sign language family ... thankfully Facebook is already localised in many languages and Facebook groups already exist per language per country per sign language family.No need to reinvent the wheel seeing it seems as though Deaf people have already figured out the technology that suits their means and can ably sign or use a written language when either is appropriate.,deaf,deor0hr,4,t5_2qi0j

11787786,0,t1_dgw1z5a,Thats a good technique yes.  Fingerspelling gesturing or pointing and then asking for the appropriate sign is a great way to expand your own vocabulary and to show others youre enthusiastic about learning.  People will probably pick up on the fact that youre a new or nonfluent signer and most will undoubtedly modify their own pace in order to give you a better chance at understanding them.  The best thing you can do is go into the experience with a genuine interest and willingness to learn.  A lot of new signers freeze up get overwhelmed and tend to draw back isolate themselves or bunch in a corner voicing with other hearing learners.  Dont do this!  Youll be surprised at how helpful people are willing to be if you show a desire to understand and be understood.On the other hand I do want to warn you that not everyone youll encounter will want to give their time to lengthy conversations with learners.  There will be some Deaf folks at the event who might not want to spend their time interacting with hearing nonfluent individuals.  Please please try not to take this as an insult or let it dissuade you from trying again.  Keep in mind that for a lot of Deaf people being at these events might be one of the only times in their daily lives where theyre able to fully interact with their tribe so to speak.  Its a place where they can step back breathe be casual and not worry about the frustrations of everyday life in a world built for the hearing.
