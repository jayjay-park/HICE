Shitloads of standard cli tools are written in one language or another yet the extensions are nowhere to be seen because nobody cares.     file L usrbinrename    usrbinrename Perl script ASCII text executableAlso adding redundant metadata to the filename introduces the possibility of conflict. What if a file named script.pl has !binbash?That said its more of a philosophical question and its up to you to answer whether you get value from that or if it offends your sense of aesthetics.  Personally i make a distinction between oneoff scripts with limited utility and localized scope eg no sense outside of one specific directory and programs preferably customizable with params and pipe compatible as to be indistinguishable from other flexible cli tools. The former get to preserve their extensions .started using .bash to make clear its not barebone sh but if a script is worthy of being in bin it gets abstracted away with no language indicator in the filename.,commandline,cofzv40,2,t5_2s4oq

It tries to split lines on word boundaries with a definition of that which is probably not well suited for noneuropean text even for nonEnglish text its not brilliant but if it cant split on a word boundary it will cut the text to make it fit in the space given. For example    printtextwrap.filloh! VeryLongWord hi there width    oh! Ve    ryLong    Word    hi    therethe rest of the code is just argument parsing.There seem to be several problems with this approach if youre doing serious work with japanese text though. For example the library assumes that an endofline is whitespace which is not true it also does not understand ideographic commas nor full stops it might understand the ideographic space I havent checked.

8392641,0,t1_d5qcuti,Thanks for pointing out this program! I installed ranger and started using it. I really like it! Its beautifully designed and looks like a CLI Finder How would you point the file launcher to target another tmux pane? I dont want it targetting another tmux session but rather a pane within the same session that ranger is also running in. I would also like to be able to open a file in vim in another pane through ranger rather than having the pane that ranger is running in open a file that I select. Any ideas on how to do that?,commandline,d5qmlfa,2,t5_2s4oq

9170913,0,t1_d8dutnm,To add another perspective heres my personal usecase I dont use a terminal file manager to substitute the shell but to visualize my file system. Im terrible at envisioning directory structures and get lost so to speak. mc helps navigating the system and the screen is updated live or synchronous compared to a dumb terminal where you would have to recall the file list anew to see the changes applied. The only commands I use straight in mc instead of its integrated shell are copying F moving F and deleting F because those shorcuts are fast and operate on visually highlighted items.,commandline,d8ehc9b,1,t5_2s4oq

9735505,0,t3_5ej9v1,It is well worth  if you have interest in learning from at least  of the books.Personally Im so late in my career that anything I might be able to glean from those books can be picked up by lurking on my subreddit of choice and watching for quality posts and occasionally trying to help out.Also I much prefer printed books for reference material. So much easier to navigate by feel to where I need to find something.I dont know if thats going to be so common in the future though as search  bookmarks get better and UIs improve and fewer people are familiar with printed books to begin with.,commandline,dad4388,8,t5_2s4oq
9830871,0,t3_5g0fpy,Yes youre piping it right if you wanted to put the grep call on another line you could do    echo file |         grep .oldYou might want to rename the file variable to filename and wrap  with double quotes. Say if the scripts argument is a directory path Old Files that would execute ls Old Files  arguments and ls will complain theres no Old and Files directories.Although practically speaking its easier to just do ls .old or find . name .old for recursive lookups ... because Bash and most other shells will expand the asterisk so ls is executed once where arguments are .old matches. As an FYI you may want to use !usrbinenv bash as the shebang incase someone running the script uses a different default path to Bash and the marker might appreciate indenting the echo call by  or  spaces.,commandline,daozfof,1,t5_2s4oq
