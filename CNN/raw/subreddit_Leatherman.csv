3365238,0,t1_cpbrss1,Have you considered the XE? It appears to be the CS with the addition of the file. You would still get the corkscrew... But everything else looks like it would be the perfect match for what youre looking for.,Leatherman,cpbv1ym,1,t5_2r6qa

4182728,0,t3_37gplc,Ill wait until the price drops to somewhere in the  range otherwise I cant justify dropping the kind of coin that they are asking for.Plus it looks like itd be easy to lose bits or have them cut into your skin somehow if the whole thing was at the right angle.Very neat and unique way to have nearly every single type of bit at your immediate disposal though gotta admit.,Leatherman,crx18rf,1,t5_2r6qa
4183748,0,t1_crx4l7v,The cybertool  looks pretty good but it seems like the extra  for the  would be worth it. The cybertool lite though doesnt look like it is worth the extra cost. It does start getting thick though so beware of that.Disclaimer I have none of the cybertools so I am only basing this on picturesvideos and some other reddit posts.,Leatherman,crx5f3r,1,t5_2r6qa

9638069,0,t3_5d1onw,As you may have read the Wave comes with a doubleended bit which is Philips on one end and straight on the other.  This bit comes stored in the bit driver ready to use so doesnt need to be carried separately.  One nice thing is that if he would like to add a bit kit at some point in the future it will work with Wave and give him many other screwing options err phrasing.  Some of the sheaths for the Wave include a little spot where a bit kit can be stowed the kit is very flat.Hope that helps.,Leatherman,da139ub,3,t5_2r6qa

11092899,0,t1_deo9s1n,I think the surge is also an upgrade I only have the wave. The charge tti seems like a lot of money for a fancy wave.,Leatherman,depdc1r,3,t5_2r6qa
