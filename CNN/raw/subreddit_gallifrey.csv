28793,0,t3_1ufk3v,I read somewhere that they intended on making an American reboot where the Doctor wouldnt just be randomly going from place to place but would be trying to uncover the history of his father I think it was the reboot intended with the th Doctor. The idea is that audiences wouldnt get the show if the character didnt have a larger motive somewhere to be going something to solve. There would need to be a larger plot at hand he couldnt just be a bohemian traveler the space hobo. Its interesting to me as an American viewer how the show is kinda forchildrenbutnotalways.  I dont think that couldve happened in America the show wouldve been more adult from the get go. I imagine that the original s episodes wouldve been like the Twilight Zone in tone and Star Trek in subject matter trying to discus morals and ethics. The Doctor wouldve remained a mysterious and creepy figure for a while with the companions being the main characters and as little as possible revealed about the Doctor. Even after regenerating the Doctor would remain mysterious. I think the zaniness of the nd doctor which set the tone a bit for the rest of the show although the rd tried to move away from it with a very James Bond like character who is also mysterious. I think his regeneration wouldve required like in the British version more of a focus on the Doctor but he wouldnt be zany and wacky the shows not for kids it wouldnt be as goofy hed be heroic. Im not going to guess what type of character hed be like though I dont want to say Because hes American hed be John WayneSupermanKirk. Although I am vaguely imagining a hero with an edge trope because hed still have the mysteriousness of the first regeneration so in order to make him more of a protagonist theyd have to justify it with some mysterious past. I guess Im imagining Don Draper. In space. Don Draper IN SPACESomeone else posted on here that the Daleks or whatever the villains would be in this could be more like Communists than Nazis. I love this idea. Or perhaps the Daleks would remain Nazish but the Cybermen would seem like Communists and thus take on a larger role than the Daleks.I find it hard to imagine the show lasting for longer than a couple seasons though. I feel like it was a miracle that it happened even in Britain I think the fact Britain is smaller helped though okay does that sound racist? because I feel like I might start sounding racist in a couple seconds. Like it was a very iconic British thing from the start I feel with the Police Box and the fact it was targeted at kids BBC worked to keep the show alive for so many years because it was Britains show so many kids had grown up with it and such.If the show did last for a long time in America I imagine it would be like Star Treks longevity. Due to reboots and new characters. Even with the regeneration I imagine just out of intuition I guess that wed see a new Doctor rather than just a new regeneration. Wed see the complete story arch of different Doctors. Some would be mysterious others would be more like heroes.Someone suggested on here that the Time Lords would be different more of an evil empire than the Doctor had to rebel from. In the current show the Doctor is really a renegade. The Time Lords have their faults the Doctor has his reasons for leaving them but the Time Lords arent really evil. I think if it was American the Time Lords would have to be some evil empire that the Doctor was morally compelled to escape from and that this backstory would play a large role in his character. I think looking at American Superheroes might also give a good idea how America would treat the Doctor character the way we treat our superheroes reflects how we treat our icons I think. Hed be idealistic at first then the show would go through a phase where it reflects more on the person behind the character then wed see a darker side of him. ,gallifrey,cehpkzn,8,t5_2tf29

36980,0,t3_1uhqrz,Cant personally say anything one way or the other on the acting visuals etc.  I genuinely enjoy both approaches and wouldnt change a thing about the dated effects of the old series in fact the only effects that stand out as bad are CGI  effects which also look dated in episodes from  nor the tendency to cast stage actors acting on stage vs screen is more different than you might think as the villains. But then I wouldnt expect those qualities to work in the new series so its hard to compare.Writing on the other hand is a different story. Classic Who was better at telling fullyfleshedout selfcontained scifi stories. New Who is better at character and plot arcs. Id argue we havent had a true character arc  one where we actually see the character evolve onscreen due to onscreen events  in some time but during the s and early s television became a characterfocused medium and Who needed to catch up. Compare to the classic series where only a few companions Jo Grant Leela Romana and Ace were truly different characters at the end of their runs and only one Ace for whose arc was actually a major focus of episodes by multiple writers.,gallifrey,cein3wa,2,t5_2tf29

You can sorta say he invented or at least helped refine Regeneration and Time Travel to allow the Gallifreyans to become Time Lords. He created a Tower that one could argue is a stasis device he sleeps in until Gallifrey needs him like a Gallifreyan King Arthur. So once the allconsuming war occurs the High Council wakesunfreezes him or he does so himself and they ask him for help to defeat the Daleks in their time of need. Rassilon realises soon after that that the war is unwinnable and creates the Ultimate Sanction to ensure he and as a byproduct the rest of the Time Lords will exist beyond the war.If the Time Lords come back Id say to expect Rassilon to go rogue and try to perform something similar to the Ultimate Sanction to ensure he survives the postwar peroid on Gallifrey after revealing his true nature.Of course none of this is said directly but I think its fair to say you can easily argue for it with what youre given in TFD and TEoT.,gallifrey,celn4nl,7,t5_2tf29

104824,0,t1_cepkxvx,There is a hue and cry on this thread because Moffat is somehow inconsistent and breaks the rules. He even breaks his own rules.  While I dont necessarily agree with this there is one thing that is absolutely consistent.  The Doctor breaks the rules rewrites the rules and tricks others into following the rules to which he doesnt hold himself accountable. This is because the Doctor is a Trickster God.  From WikipediagtThe trickster deity breaks the rules of the gods or nature sometimes maliciously for example Loki but usually with ultimately positive effects though the tricksters initial intentions may have been either positive or negative. Often the bendingbreaking of rules takes the form of tricks e.g. Eris or thievery. Tricksters can be cunning or foolish or both they are often funny even when considered sacred or performing important cultural tasks. Not convinced? Here is more gtFrequently the Trickster figure exhibits gender and form variability changing gender roles and even occasionally engaging in samesex practices.While the Doctors sexuality is best left off the table for this discussion I think it helps illustrate two points in particular. . We know that Moffat has stated that his Doctor is very much like a fairy tale character.  . There are great many allusions in New Who in general and Moffats era in particular to a certain mythologizing of the Doctor. After all the Doctor is being portrayed by the schismatic Church of the Silence as their great Adversary or even devil if you will.  Moffat is very consistent in writing the Doctor as the one who changes ignores uses the rules at his choosing.   I think too many people who criticize Moffats run do so because they want to enforce a particular style of order on the narrative structure. Therefore they claim that there are no rules.  edit formatTLDR Moffats Doctor is a Trickster Deity who is not bound by any rule other than he decides which rules suit him at a particular moment.,gallifrey,ceqd66i,3,t5_2tf29

He had just changed the fate of his people with the direct help of two previous incarnations and the indirect help of the rest of his incarnations. So the speech caps off the introduction of the War Doctor into the series and it wouldnt have seemed right to leave that unaddressed or to have the new Doctor be responsible for doing that himself. I have no idea but it seemed to me that Matt Smith hadnt planned to leave the series until relatively late. That would explain the unusual aspects of The Time of the Doctor.

391655,0,t1_cfl9izq,Happily I am not a fellow. And I can only speculate on the colour of Time Lords kidneys. I am guessing that Time Lord physiology is quite different from ours. They do after all have two hearts which are apparently not redundant. In The Shakespeare Code one of the Doctors hearts was stopped and Martha had to restart it to get the Doctor out of severe distress. In a circulatory system like ours a second heart would be redundant. And redundancy is not a bad thing our bodies are loaded with it. So the Time Lords second heart serves a differentadditional purpose from a human heart. Alternatively he has two entirely separate circulatory systems but that just seems too complicated... From this I conclude that a Time Lords kidneys possibly also have additional roles. Perhaps they are very important in a regeneration event? The kidneys and the liver are the bodys major detoxifiers. Perhaps regeneration involves a great deal of detoxification? Any physiologic process that uses a great deal of energy is likely to produce a great deal of toxic byproducts which could very well account for the Doctors postregeneration dementia. A little bit like the mental distress of a uremic crisis or even hepatic encephalopathy.As for the ideal colour of Time Lord kidneys who knows? A cat with kidneys that are the wrong colour has a serious disease. Maybe the Doctors kidneys are still reeling from regeneration and are lets hope temporarily the wrong colour?,gallifrey,cfld04k,3,t5_2tf29

Anyone would be stupid to leave the show with no way of returning. The Doctors story is infinite and its always great to see how the show reflects the period in which it is made.

And why? Why Doctor Who? How did that happen?I dont watch a lot of current television so Ill have to take his word for it but I can confirm the sentiment as Ive watched many hours of TV in my lifetime nothing Ive ever seen has compared to Doctor Who in terms of pure warmth.Your fictional possible ending above alexbaldwinftw is truly well done.

I was just giving a suggestion but I probably should have mentioned in my original comment it was just a suggestion. I personally dont read fanfiction with a character based on the author. Actually I rarely read fanfiction that has an OC as a major character. I also dont read Doctor Who slash fanfiction either however I do for other fandoms.

528500,0,t3_205afh,The Doctor is very very old. We dont know how old because he loses track and he probably lies. But at this point hes over  years old if he did indeed spend  years on Trenzalore so Im guessing hes pretty much who hes going to be. For any Buffy fans out there he is no longer cookie dough he is baked. Also I would propose that a sentient being with a long life would change and grow much more slowly than one with a relatively short life span. I.e. The Doctor would change much more slowly than a companion. I like to see good character arcs in the companions. As for The Doctor maybe he could learn one thing from each companion. From Rose perhaps he learned that one should say I love you before time runs out. From Rory I hope he learned that he can make people dangerous to themselves. What can he learn from Clara? Its not clear to me yet. I hope he doesnt learn TOO much though because I like him best when he makes mistakes and has to be reined in as in The Waters of Mars. ,gallifrey,cg0ci7g,1,t5_2tf29

554141,0,t3_20hh8o,Oooo yes I love this kind of question.You get ultimately what you want from the audio dramas. I started with the Eighth Doctor Adventures which are aimed at new listeners who are more versed in the New Series than anything else and theyre highly recommended. The Eighth Doctor did have monthly adventures and they were initially the most archeavy of all the monthlies occupying a large portion of the first  in terms of arc but the Eighth Doctor Adventures seem to take place a long time after those monthlies and are specifically made so you dont need to listen to any of the monthlies. This is where I started. They are good and they do not have the messed up nonlinearity that may be required for monthly arcs. I suggest buying these by season youll save a ton of money this way. There are a lot of monthlies that are entirely skippable and it is difficult to find ways of finding out which ones are wellloved or factor into other stories in the future. The first  are an excellent starting point and theyre only  bucks so you can literally just choose one at random and youd probably be fine though thats not what Im going to recommend you do. The Eighth Doctor audios cover an arc that is a very good arc up to the big th audio Zagreus. Its difficult to explain what the best monthlies are for someone just getting into them but the payoff for a lot of monthlies is enormous and very gratifying.If you want specifics Im happy to help.,gallifrey,cg39gjs,11,t5_2tf29

565530,1,t3_20lfom,Well we would need somebody who looks just like William Hartnell. The current incarnation of the doctor faces an enemy that forces him to do something weve seen before but is constantly warned against the Doctor crosses his own time line. However unlike his previous incarnations this Doctor doesnt have any help from the Time Lords stabilizing time from the outside. He must risk doing this on his own. And its a terrible gamble which he loses. As our Doctor X interacts with  time begins to split in two. X finds himself as the center of this tear living in both time streams and able to cross from one to the other. he realizes that the only way to fix what he has done is to stabilise BOTH time streams in tandem. He is very confused about how this is to be done and we see him reading many gallifreyan books and taking notes at several points. He explains to his companion what he plans to do but that the trouble is the very point at which time branches off in two directions. If he doesnt get this right then a thousand different time lines will all spring forth branch off at every instant from his original time line and then again from those time lines ad infinitum to the point where they start to bleed together again. Anyways the mystery elementIn the second time line  diesregenerates much younger and becomes a different  b if you will. Completely different character. And so on along the way a whole new line of Doctors. Honestly this is the way I would have gone around Smiths ending rather than this cheaptrick new regen cycle crap. seriously disappointed in that element. And so along this new adventure to stabilise two time streams the Doctor meets his alternate past b and b becomes the main character following a completely original time stream. This goes on to the end of season with b. Next season opens similar to the way New Who started with now b stepping out of the Tardis. Audience at this point is confused and sorta annoyed probably if b was well done. Thing is b doesnt understand why he came to be. He doesnt have any recollection of why he has regenerated. The Time Lords know only that something has happened. They refer to it as a collision between the two time lines and that it has something to do with The Doctor. They know not which one  b X and bam whole new adventure undefined time line The Doctor doesnt even know whats going on etc. ,gallifrey,cg4k1g5,2,t5_2tf29

Remember in Blink when Sally Sparrow gave the Doctor a manuscript which the Doctor then read out in front of a camera which was the basis for the manuscript Sally then gave to him? Or remember in The Big Bang when Amelia got her drink stolen and therefore led to her being thirsty later which led to the Doctor going back in time and stealing her younger self the drink to give it to her thirsty older self? There is no before or after. Theres just a big ball of wibbly wobbly timey wimey stuff. Also Gallifrey was always saved.  just couldnt remember it.

Except sometimes he doesnt. All those times in history when there was no sign of him I wanted to know why not. But I dont need to ask any more. I know the answer now. Sometimes the Doctor must look at this planet and turn away in shame. Im recording this in case anyone ever finds it so you can see... you can see how the world ended. I think she actually hit the nail on the head and whether UNIT would even have been able to reach him is irrelevant.  There are probably times in human history even in the darkest moments where the Doctor has to stay away and let things happen.  He never interferes with humanity he just prevents external influences from interfering with them  and to me Children of Earth was less a story of the alien threat and more a story of how humanity faced that threat.That and considering he has seen the history of humanity from beginning to end he very likely knew that they were going to be able to solve this one in the end.,gallifrey,cgf43lo,25,t5_2tf29

805180,0,t1_cgvsbcx,I get why that event would rub you the wrong way. But I saw it more like she was all swept up after such a dangerous adventure where the Doctor ultimately rescues her. It was more a moment of weakness for her I felt is perfectly reasonable to think any human could have a similar response.This also happened before the nature of her relationship with Rory was strongly established. At that point we couldnt really know how out of character that would feel later on. And as Rory was introduced as a main companion and they were together more their relationship developed quite a bit to the point where their love really grew stronger and her making a pass at another guy would be really out of place. So there was very much an A gt B in her character development in my view.Again I can completely understand why her character would bother people. Like most people in this thread are saying its totally subjective. This is just my view but maybe I am a bit blinded by her being my first companion. I think Im generally over that honeymoon period though and I definitely can concede there are parts of her character that I wasnt crazy about. I generally like her though.I think it also has a lot to do with the chemistry between KarenMattArthur though they were just a lot of fun to watch together.,gallifrey,cgvswl4,11,t5_2tf29

I took this to mean while Rose had the time vortex in her head part of her Bad Wolf persona somehow found its way into the Moment and inhabited it.So the two possibilities are  omniscient RoseBad Wolf sees all of time and realises she can help the Doctor save Gallifrey and so allows part of herself to inhabit the Moment.  the Moment adopts a personality that the Doctor wont remember in the form of someone he hasnt met yet.To me the first option makes far more sense and so seems much more likely.,gallifrey,cgwnzzc,3,t5_2tf29

1245525,0,t1_ci9hzaa,Lets take a moment to remember the youngest woman on Bowie Base One cant remember her name though. The way she is introduced the camera angles the glances between her and the Doctor everything makes it look like she will be the companion of that episode. Not only does that role get taken by someone else but in she ends up being genuinely terrified by the Doctor. Not many episodes go against your expectations the way The Waters of Mars does. It easily gets my vote.,gallifrey,ci9qjr9,3,t5_2tf29
1253449,0,t3_28dug6,No.Doctor Who has always been about adventure....but even in the most dire situations the Doctor saves everyone.NuWho has the same idea but compounds on it more by making the character interactions much more personal.  The character growth makes them really mean something to us.  We know them.  We love them.But most importantly NuWho is telling us a feel good story.  If there is a death of a friend it needs to really MEAN something.  A random death is pointless and would make people MORE angry.SPOILERS AHEAD th doctor!!!!For example lets talk about the big companion death Adric.  Adric could have died from a simple shot from a cyberman but he didnt.  He died trying to save the world.  It wasnt random.  In fact he almost escaped but instead ran back into the ship.  Essentially we have one of the biggest weenies sacrificing himself to save Earth.  Much like the doctor would.  It was heroic and noble and we remember him fondly for it.Death in any story has to have meaning with two exceptions Bloody war movies and sometimes the doctor himself.  The doctor can go on even after dying so his death doesnt have to be as meaningful...although it normally does in Nuwho.But when it comes to a mortal companion death must be a product of their own choices and never arbitrary.,gallifrey,ciammjz,1,t5_2tf29

But for my money The Empty ChildThe Doctor Dances is the pinnacle of Doctor Who. Im not kidding it accomplishes so much in  minutes its almost astounding. The writing direction tone pacing sound amp acting are phenomenal throughout. Not one piece of dialogue is wasted amp every shot looks gorgeous. The ending is so satisfying because Moffat has crafted what amounts to a horror story in which every character is sympathetic. He continues to experiment with moral ambiguity and its debatable how successful he is but right here? The Empty ChildThe Doctor Dances? He knocked it out the park.,gallifrey,cic9qkm,4,t5_2tf29
1270124,0,t3_28mirt,note to the guys who are confused hes talking about Big Finishs recent Trial of the Valeyard releasegtIts said that he was created when the twelfth Peter Capaldi was experimenting on ways to break the twelve regeneration cycles of Time Lords. but capaldi isnt the twelfth incarnation of the Doctor Smith is or Metaten. Why would Capaldi bother with expanding his regenerations in the first place? He already got a brand new set and dozens of new bodies to go he doesnt need the valeyard. Assuming the backstory given in the release is true in the first place it was quite ambigious.,gallifrey,cici7wr,2,t5_2tf29
1280631,0,t1_cidne3w,I agreei think the metacrisis doctor will be the Valeyard as well.It was just a few weeks ago that I believe that Rose would leave him because he is not the Doctor he is half human and as a result he is flawed. Her rejection will cause him to seek to be more like that Doctor and since he cannot regenerate he will begin to steal regenerations from others. Considering that the Movie Doctor said he was half human they could tie that in somehow. Afterall everything about that movie was very undoctorish except for the regeneration from the beginning it could go a long way to explaining thing and tie the movie into cannon much more closely instead of just say ignore that part,gallifrey,cidos1w,2,t5_2tf29

The only reason I watched the whole thing is because there were parts here and there that were good and the idea seemed like it could be great.

It actually made me angry that I had sat through that entire series.,gallifrey,ciehed1,2,t5_2tf29
1289177,0,t1_cidne3w,Have you considered the Time Lords or Rassilon and Omega turned Gallifrey into a Singleton? only one version of Gallifrey exists ever across all of space and time in all universesIts hinted by Ten that Gallifrey kept travel between parallel universes possible. If Gallifrey existed in another parallel universe couldnt the other one keep monitoring it? If Gallifrey isnt a Singleton then that means there exists a parallel universe where the Daleks didnt come into existence and Gallifrey did evolve with Time Lords. If you suppose an infinite amount of parallel universes then its very likely true. I guess its true that its not conclusive theres no way to say that there isnt a Gallifrey clone out there...Two thing to consider. Gallifrey seems to always be in sync. Time Lords never meet out of order if the TARDISes or Gallifrey can prevent it. Even the Master wasnt able to really meet the Doctor out of sync yes Harold Saxon does influence the Doctor during season  but thats about as close as we got and Gallifrey wasnt around so all it shows is that there is a precedent for one Time Lord interfering with anothers past. Is it possible Gallifrey itself has a mechanism to stop Time Lords from tampering with their pasts? Then shouldnt Gallifrey also be in sync with the parallel universes? Itd be chaos otherwise with Time Lords moving back and forth between the universes and tampering with each Gallifreys past.So I propose there is one Gallifrey across each universe all time and space and this is made possible by the Eye of Harmony or a similar apparatus. It syncs the Time Lords because Gallifrey is unique and because its buffered and segregated from the rest of the universe almost like a gulf with a narrow entrance is to an ocean.. The Doctor as of The Big Bang is not the same Doctor as The Pandorica Opens. When he enters the Pandorica he ends up outside the universe looking in. Technically the Pandorica process only recreates things. So when Amy notices he isnt there the Doctor is being recreated. Either the Doctor is also a singleton possible! especially since he was with the TARDIS a prime candidate for a singleton itself due to the eye of harmony! or theres now two doctors one trapped outside the universe going through his life in reverse without any new regenerations feeling cheated out of his life... Sounds familiar?So I wonder if the OldDoctor didnt try to break in and steal those regenerations out of bitterness hes shown to have an evil side but then becoming part of his own history. As for how he gets back... The Gallifreyan defenses would allow him because he formed a time loop while the time lock was active? Because the encounter with the Valeyard is what makes Seven more manipulative setting the course for Eight being a romantic and so on and so forth?Thoughts?,gallifrey,ciendlv,1,t5_2tf29

1320674,0,t3_297gof,The War Games should have one but its understandable that they didnt.  In this matchup we have the Caves of Androzani the quintessential dark episode of Doctor Who up against the Eleventh Hour Doctor Who at its most joyful.  Both are excellent.  Caves is a masterfully plotted episode that finally makes Davison the Doctor he could have been all along  its got taut structure complex characters with varying motivations the best direction in the classic series a fantastic cliffhanger and a great regeneration scene.  It has its flaws  Peri is treated as an object throughout the episode and the dragon thing pretty much exists to fill time  but its a truly excellent episode.  The Eleventh Hour sets out to establish the Eleventh Doctor and Amy Pond as characters while also providing a compelling story and setting up the arc for series  and proving a new production team is up to the task of making Doctor Who.  It knocks all of these out of the park.  Its showing off of course but whats wrong with that?  My vote goes to the Eleventh Hour here.,gallifrey,cii6ycr,3,t5_2tf29

1348238,0,t1_cil8r7r,Have to disagree. Day of the Doctor didnt do any of that. None of it was wiped away it all still happened just the way we saw it. What you saw in DotD was the Doctors redemption for sins he never committed but fully intended to. He went into that shack with the Moment fully intending to destroy both sides for all time. When he came out both sides were indeed apparently gone from the universe even if the details of how it happened were a bit fuzzy.When the truth is revealed to him he was redeemed in his own mind. He wasnt a failure anymore. He didnt succumb to the depravities of the Time War along with the rest of his race. He was The Doctor through and through. He found a way to fix things without needing to kill anyone. His depression  his anger  and his grief  still existed are still very real and were not dreamed away by the writers but simply given context.Imagine it as a man who thought he killed his family in a car wreck because he was careless all his life. He blames himself even though he  doesnt quite remember what happened. Years later after trying to help others drive and live more carefully he finds out that a drunk driver was to blame for the accident not him. That he was not careless and because of his careful driving he managed to stay alive when everyone should have died. Thats what this was. It was redemption.,gallifrey,cilakwh,12,t5_2tf29

Ok theres a big theme of robotesque creatures wanting to spread their idealized view. But also Orks do it just because its fun Hal had a conflict that he saw could only be resolved by murder Zaius honestly believes hes protecting his species as well as the Mutants the CIA Caeser and Aldo damn that series has a lot of rhyming and heck even in Metropolis the villains IIRC were only acting to prevent a class uprising that would have seen them deposed if not executed.The only SciFi villains I can think of that are doing it for nonidealized reasons are Emperor Palpatine wants power and to exterminate Jedi Khan Noonien Singh Revenge is a dish best served cold and spaaaace.... Is coold... Galactus Cause Im hungrryyy and even then you can argue Gah Lak Tus is an idealized version OBrien from Nineteen Eighty Four with the way he thinks about power he really reminds me of Palpatine and.. Rassilon. Yeah its weird but Ive only ever seen Rassilons motivations as I need to survive no matter what. I didnt see him as protecting the Time Lords purity or saving the universe from the Daleks I saw it as a weak man who was so scared of death hed do nothing to stop himself.Davros skirts around this issue sometimes. Sometimes he knows what he is doing will destroy all of his other options he could easily have made peace on Skaro when you think of it the fact he could get into the Thal bunker itself means a lot. Othertimes he feels genuinely insane. On that note Journeys End for all its nonDavros faults is one of the best depicitions IMO of Davros because it shows his multifacted personality his intelligence his genius his sadism his unconditional willpower his desire for the Daleks above his own life and most of all his insanity.Really genuinely evil doesnt mean anything. Every villain has a reason for their actions. I think theres a saying that a villain believes he is the hero of his own story.

1592429,0,t3_2ciirn,I had the same problem for a very long time. A few tips you might have already tried some of those but anyway  Generally speaking comedy ages very well and horror ages terribly. For this reason funny episodes like City of Death The Pirate Planet Talons of WengChiang Horns of Nimon Carnival of Monsters yeah a lot of Tom you get the idea The Myth Makers Revelation of the Daleks  are a very good way in and work a lot better than The Seeds of Doom Robots of Death or other episodes like that.  Watch episodes that for some reason youre already interested in. Be it Gallifrey history a monster you know a guest star or just an intriguing title. Dont make watching it a chore.  If you have somebody who will watch it with you make it a thing together. Many slassic serials are almost more interesting to talk about than to actually watch. And its always fun to discuss which monster has the silliest costume. It will get you through the boring bits.  If you like something rewatch it. No not immediately but you may very well enjoy it even more the second time once youve kind of gotten used to the language of the episode. ,gallifrey,cjfw9u0,30,t5_2tf29

This is a rare character that can be any sex without any real effect on the story. We let him have all manner of accents and ages  why is this one attribute so special that it needs to be a big part of the story?I think it would be better for it to be based in the story as his varying age and accent has eventually been retconned to do but its a high bar set only for this one thing.,gallifrey,cjgvl9o,2,t5_2tf29

1698510,0,t3_2duil3,Out of universe I can understand why it can be annoying to constantly bring it up since for us his name really does not mean anything different but in universe I can understand why it is important. The Doctor has travelled the known universe and much of the unknown for centuries now and even after trying to purge his own existence at one point he is still well known. The Doctor may not always mean the same thing to every person who hears it but everyone has a strong reaction to it. It is his identity. It also seems to be a trend amongst those who leave Gallifrey to adopt some sort of moniker The Monk The Master The Rani etc. especially if they are a renegade of some sort. Interestingly enough they all knew each other as youths on Gallifrey.If our interactions with the Time Lords are any indication the Doctor probably wanted little to do with them for most of his life and I do not think it is so much the name but what he thinks of it that leads him to keep it a secret. By speaking the name you could probably sense his strongest emotion connected to it. This in turn would give you an idea as to why he left Gallifrey was he angry ashamed sad etc.. Something in his past was strong enough to convince him to break his peoples first law. If curiosity was enough to get him to leave his first incarnation would not have been so old and likely would not have had a family.Edit And if the Cartmel Masterplan had ever seen the light of day his true name could have had something to do with him possibly being The Other i.e. his real name was not even directly known to any modern Time Lords other than Rassilon and Omega. If Rassilon or Omega knew anything of his relation to The Other now you could imagine the insanity that would spring forth since both are pretty far gone round the bend. ,gallifrey,cjt9dti,1,t5_2tf29

1758371,0,t3_2elqb7,I think the doctor pushed him. It just seemed unlikely that the droid would be able to kill himself or if he would want to. The Doctor on the other hand he isnt above murder. He abhors violence and avoids it at all costs but hell do what he has to to protect the people he loves namely humans. An example is the Sontaran Strategem he was prepared to blow up the ship. And the ultimate example the Time War itself. Albeit the stakes were a lot higher in these two cases.

When Lis Sladen left they were originally going to kill Sarah Jane off but Tom Baker and Lis Sladen werent having any of it. The eventual farewell scene was largely improvised. At one point during the troublesome Sixth Doctor era the producers seriously considered  bringing Patrick Troughton back for a series before turning the Doctor into a woman. The opening scenes of Castrovalva took ages to shoot because Matthew Waterhouse Adric had been out drinking and had to keep going behind a tree to be sick. One proposed American series in the s featured the Doctor going off to find his father aided by the spirit of Borusa merged with the TARDIS featured pirate Cybermen and would also feature remakes of third Doctor episodes such as the Daemons but set in America. Douglas Adams once submitted a script that was basically The Ark In Space to Robert Holmes while Holmes was writing The Ark In Space.

Moffat shouldve met Robert Jordan I think they wouldve gotten along well togetherOr maybe I just think the show has become too much about the Doctor.  Completely the opposite of what I said in an earlier post  It seems like every episode has to be a major lesson learned by the Doctor.

That right there is one of the things that makes me really dig this episode.  I often feel sorry for or happy for or scared for The Doctor.  I almost never feel empathy for The Doctor because I cannot really identify with him.  The Doctor is in many ways unknowable for a nonTime Lord creature.  But in that moment he was a scared youngster hiding under the covers and that is something that is easy to understand.I feel like the emotional core of this episode was almost throwback to when Moffat was writing episodes of Doctor Who and not needing to worry so much about showrunning Doctor Who.,gallifrey,ckht7vr,5,t5_2tf29

In classic Who they invaded Gallifrey. In NuWho they express disappointment that they were not allowed to join in with the war IIRC but know that the Timelords are gone.   Of course this does cause paradoxes. If you accept that the Sontarans anywhen in the post war universe can only know of the Timelords in the past then presumably the very first post time war Sontaran to ever hear about the Timelords must also have have known of them as a race that were gone but would also have had an expectation that Sontar could have been involved in that war.

Coordinator Engin is speaking with Spandrell Castellan of the  Chancellery Guard.  In discussing a message the Doctor left for them they saygtEngin Apparently he is or was at one time a member of that noble Chapter. Prydonian  Spandrell How can you tell?  Engin Well the biog data extracts of Time Lords are colorcoded according to Chapter.  Spandrell I didnt know that.  Engin No? Well your duties usually involve you with more plebeian classes dont they Castellan.  It has been argued that the last line means he doesnt deal with Time Lords a higher class than regular Gallifreyans.  But we could just as easily have a debate as to whether all Time Lords have a Chapter and he is referring to that set of Time Lords.But with the confirmation that one must go to the Academy to become a Time Lord we now know that it is indeed a title and it is one that is earned not born into.,gallifrey,ckkia79,1,t5_2tf29

Not Doctor Whos best work but perfectly fun. Slightly differently Power of the Daleks. I like neither Daleks nor recons but I do like postregenerative episodes so better watch the first one eventually. Oh wow this is really good and I have absolutely no problems with this format this time.And on an entirely different note and way before for me when I got the Series  DVD and looked at the episode list I was sure that  was a fullepisode Hitchhikers Guide tribute and I was just as sure that it was going to be more cringey than funny in the way that shows trying to mimic particular styles of comedy tend to be.

They can extrude doorknobs? They take dimensional energy? What? more magic with clara using the screwdriver to divert energy the dr getting angry for no reason and giving a terrible unconvincing speech before using the sonic as a cureall yet againThis season has wasted Capaldis talents by putting him in the backseat to an average actor in Jenna Coleman and working with average scripting poor ideas and another pointless egotistical storyarc by Moffatt. Id settle for a single standalone episode that didnt feel compelled to tie into some nonsense about the Doctors backstory or a companions love life. There is more than enough here to work with without resorting to a fat Bristolian telling the audience he wants to ram things.

2320394,0,t1_clxzfev,gt I have been more and more unhappy with the direction Mr. Moffat has chosen to go in and even his impression of what the show is about. This whole season seemed to be about Claras dating life. It really bothered me. I like Clara well enough but we spent the first several episodes just trying to figure out what kind of Doctor Capaldi would be since he was still acting drugged out from regenerating. Then he finally started to normalize and we get shunted into this stupid forced romance between Clara and Danny we see more of them and their dating life than we do of her going on adventures with the Doctor. I get that maybe Moffat wanted to add a human story to what is normally an episodic scifi show but the two dont have to be mutually exclusive you dont have to take her on earth doing human things and just bolt it on to her doing scifi things on the side. It didnt even make sense. The Doctor abandons her somewhere for two weeks so she just becomes a teacher suddenly?

2323920,0,t3_2lv2s9,There have been eight actors to play the Master but only three incarnations of the character throughout the onscreen history.Roger Delgado first portrayed the Master as a recurring villain during the Third Doctor era. Delgados own death meant that his Master never got a final story and the character was quietly retired until  Peter Pratt portrayed an emaciated husk of a man that was the Master during the hilariously named Fourth Doctor episode The Deadly Assassin. This is where the regeneration limit storyline comes from as the Master is on his final life and desperately hanging on as he tries to get around the limit. There is nothing to suggest he is playing anything other than an ancient version of the Delgado Master though.Geoffrey Beever briefly played the same role so still the emaciated Delgado Master during the final stories of the Fourth Doctor. Using crazy mindabilities he transfers into the body of a humanoid alien played by...Anthony Ainley who will portray the Master for the remainder of the original series. Note that while he is in a nonTime Lord body he is still technically the same incarnation that is the Delgado Master and its shown several times that he is desperately seeking immortality. At the start of the  TV Movie the Master is executed by the Daleks but apparently the Master has the ability to turn into EVIL SPACE SLIME and jump into the body of another being in this case a medic played byEric Roberts Who at the end of the film is killed by falling into the Eye of Harmony. Or something. It wasnt a great film. But it does mean that the Delgado Master has finally died.OR HAS HE?In the revived series the Master tells the Doctor that he was brought back by the Time Lords to fight in the Time War. Now it could be they brought back a completely different altered or new incarnation of the Master so you can assume a new regeneration here if you like. For the purposes of straining this even further I like to pretend it is the Delgado Master they brought back possibly in the form of Anthony Ainley who did have a habit of running away very quickly when things got tough. It would explain why he fled from the Time War and used the Chameleon Arch to live out his days asDerek Jacobi who at the end of Utopia does fully regenerate thus definitively ending the Delgado incarnation once and for all. He becomes John Simm who presumably regenerated into Michelle Gomez after the events of David Tennants finale.,gallifrey,clyy7xa,3,t5_2tf29

Anyone with a heart and a child will tell you that the words I love you always will belong to their child.Thats my opinion.

No love angles where somebody loves somebody else who loves the doctor or where the doctor has a hidden crush on somebody.Id like the next companion to be more alien than the doctor.

2449043,0,t1_cmdxwix,Because Moffat cant write plot arcs to save his life nor can he develop characters. Hes good at short stories  ie. those oneoffs that were good in the RTDera. He doesnt understand how to wrap up a story how to pace an arc how to write emotionally satisfying scenes emotionally satisfying means there is sacrifice in your victory!! The doctor rarely sacrifices anything in Moffatera Who. Even when the Ponds left it was all they lived happily ever after dont worry and all of his female characters are essentially fasttalking clever fiery creatures with few other personality traits no motives or lives outside of the Doctor. When Amy Pond grew up a little she stopped being an interesting character on the show because he didnt understand how to write her as a person outside of the Doctor.TBH I know Moffat vs RTD is a controversial topic so I accept that a lot of people will disagree with me. But as a writer it just drives me nuts when he drags the mystery out for all its worth and builds it up to be some lifechanging thing for the Doctor and in the end he just idk writes himself into a corner and pulls some deus ex machina out of his ass.,gallifrey,cmeelxv,4,t5_2tf29

We want it to be the case so much that its often portrayed as such. The idea that dying of old age is somehow not sad. But its never time and dying usually sucks.

2667525,0,t3_2qiyix,I like to think of the events of the th anniversary episode as the Doctor amongst himselves starting to work through both is midlife crisis and his conflict over seeing his status as a warrior and his identity as the Doctor as fundamentally incompatible. I think s character development is a continuation of this. As   amp  he was crippling alone and blamedhated himself for it. He associated beingacting like an adult with being the War Doctor  so he fled from that. And he thought his planet and people were gone so he turned to his adopted planetspecies. He is ancient and alien but part of him desperately wanted to be the dashing young human man he looked like. He wanted to have the innocence and youth he finds in his companions. I think now he is moving past that but it is a rough process. He is letting himself feel his age again and recognizing that he is fundamentally alien to his human friends. He is dealing with the pain that acknowledgement unavoidably causes him. He is still alone but he no longer blames himself and has hope he may not be alone forever. He still fears his potential for destruction and even madness if he allows himself to act as  warrior but he is learning to control that aspect of himself and not project his own self loathing on others.  Now he is learning to be happy as the old man and as the alien. To be honest and emotionally vulnerable with his friends without pretending to be human.,gallifrey,cn6rqex,1,t5_2tf29

Youll then continue with a bit more modern production values all the way up to the Eighth Doctor by which time you may have enough of an appreciation for the classic series that youll be able to manage the slower paced black and white stories of the First and Second Doctors. Then... youll finish with the Third Doctor which is another classic era.

Sometimes I wonder if the original design would have been more cliche and forgotten like some Robby the Robot or the Lost in Space robot ripoff.The rebooted American series trying to be produced was what lead into the McGann movie being made but the movie as is isnt part of it if that makes sense. Originally it was going to be a straightup reboot of the series with the Doctor looking for his father. Spielberg apocryphally was involved until he saw the first few scripts and thought it was a ripoff of the Last Crusade. They moved from Touchstone to Fox and there it was beaten by a fresh SciFi series called Sliders about travelling to alternate Earths such as a world where nukes were never invented and a comet is going to smash into Earth unless the heroes can help build one to save them or one where the American Revolution failed or one where CroMagnons actually became the dominant form of life on the planet and were later flanderized into realitysliding nazis... It was a weird show that was far easier for them to market than an english dood flying around in a phone box. By the by I wholeheartedly recommend Sliders if only for Gimlis actors awesome performances  The McGann film was a desperate attempt at a backdoor pilot if it was sucessful they would have commissioned an entire series such as say Star Trek in the s or Battlestar Galacticas  pilot.

3327859,0,t3_2y9tj9,First of all this is a great story isnt it? And judging from a random sample of discussions random meaning the discussions I can remember might now it seems to be the secondmost popular series finale on this subreddit after series . Now I love it as well but I dont think it deserves to be rated quite that high. Heres the thing This is the only twopart season finale so far where the second episode is considerably better than the first episode. And I assume that thats why its being talked about with so much good will. Because the ladt ten minutes of Bad Wolf and all of The Parting of the Ways is undoubtably brilliant. Its full of iconic moments the Daleks are spinetinglingly scary its one of the best baseundersage stories since the Troughton era Roses scene on Earth with Jackie and Mickey is her best moment of her entire era and it culminates in a wonderfully executed regeneration.Its the ending that makes it. People criticise the series  finale for its rubbish ending even though The Sound of Drums is really enjoyable. Likewise The Stolen Earth is incredibly good fun and uses the Daleks well. And Dark Water is one of the most perfect  minutes of New Who. But because the second episodes werent in some cases quite in others at all up to the standard the stories as a whole are received more harshly then they wouldve been if the quality gap had been the other way around.Because once youve seen the wonderful second episode its quite easy to forget the fact that the first  minutes of Bad Wolf are a series of blackcomedy skits parodying television shows which were hot during the time of production. One problem with parts of the RTD era always was that it was very focused on current happenings in Britain which was an understandable decision to establish Doctor Who as something new and not as the return of an old s show but Bad Wolf just steps way over the line and watching it today is such a bizarr experience because it looks just ridiculously dated and younger people catching up on old episodes or viewers outside the UK will just be left baffled by it.Really all of the skits werent really that great to begin with. The Big Brother one is probably the best but even that falls kind of flat because the joke that the contestants who are voted out are killed is completely obvious from the beginning and the Doctors and Roses in The Weakest Link obliviousness is just annoying. There are people crying around you obviously fearing for their lives why are you laughing like its all fun? Do you not have any kind of emotional capability? Jacks is just funny. He pulls a gun out of his arse for gods sake. But paired with the sheer dread and horribleness thats going on at the same time it feels like its from a completely different show. One of the things RTD always loved to do was blending the funny and absurd and the downright bleak. In his best work he pulls off this hard task masterfully. Here it doesnt work. Bad WolfThe Parting of the Ways doesnt become a great story until the Daleks show up and theres less jokes and no references to  television programme anymore. And yes then its amazing. But dont forget about Never wear black with colour it makes the colour look cheap and the black look boring.,gallifrey,cp7lq86,16,t5_2tf29

The halfseason started with Great Intelligence had him appear again directly involved with Clara then they had the Sun God which was kind of like an old god. I like the everyone girl that is common and the person the audience relates to but it does not fit when you make a big deal about the impossible girl. that isnt average that isnt ordinary.

When Capaldi was talking about Susan at the Doctor Who Experience incharacter he said that he promised to go back but never did. So there definitely is a story to be told there. It just needs somebody whos willing to tell it. And that wont be Moffat. The time to bring Susan back was during the th anniversary celebrations the next few seasons should and I think will be more about looking into the future and a character as necessarily retrospective as Susan probably wouldnt help. Also I guess he was sure he didnt have any plans for her in  when Big Finish brough her back otherwise he wouldve stopped them.Im happy either way really.

When it comes to the ones penned by Lawrence Miles it should be noted that he is not for everyone. He definitely had more than Doctor Who in mind when he developed his story ideas so some dont quite stick and his disagreement over the arcs conclusion is the reason why he penned his own series.

4091201,0,t1_crly1se,gtClara knows the Doctor wouldnt do this.You would be right if she wasnt dead wrong. She didnt even try asking him first she didnt even bring up the issue at all she just waltzed in and started chucking TARDIS keys into a volcano. The Doctor doesnt even argue with her in any way once he figures out what happens he just tells her that now theyre going to go look for Danny. Then she never even apologies. Maybe your argument is that shes a completely shitty person on purpose in which case fine Ill let you have that but it doesnt make her any fun to watch in my opinion. She didnt even ask him first she has no clue how he feels about it until he offers to help her find him after she acts like a total asshole. Really think about it. Someone breaks into your house throws you outside locks all the doors and then starts destroying the keys. When theyve destroyed all the keys you ask them what the hell is wrong with them they say that they needed to spend the night and were pretty sure youd say no. Then you... forgive them instantly and start setting up your foldout couch? No way that jerk would owe me more than an apology.gtThats the strongest bond Ive seen in Doctor WhoYoure free to feel that way but its fake as hell to me. For one I dont believe that Clara is such a deplorable person that she would do what she did without even getting the Doctors opinion first. If he had actually told her no and then she tried to forcibly take the TARDIS that wouldve worked. As it stands she just marched in and started destroying things without even getting his input. Then for him to instantly forgive her for this... no I dont believe that either. You brought up Fathers Day so Ill bring up The Long Game. The Doctor has experience with people trying to take advantage of him and as you said he doesnt make the same mistake twice. She just tried to steal the TARDIS without even telling him her situation first. He shouldve thrown her out of the TARDIS and bailed just like he did with Adam. Especially since she doesnt even apologies afterward. Maybe I just didnt want her to be such a horrifically terrible person but thats the only way what youre saying would make any sense. If their relationship is supposed to be building toward Clara being an extremely shitty person who takes advantage of him while he pathetically kisses up to her and does whatever she wants due to attachment from his previous incarnation then yeah Moffat is doing an incredible job. If theyre actually supposed to be building toward being friends... I genuinely feel bad for you if you think the Doctor and Claras relationship is anything that remotely resembles friendship. In Last Christmas they rekindle their relationship based on the fact that they lie to each other all the time. Because we tell each other lies constantly is a great foundation for a friendship?gtClara has seen and even been with other incarnations of the Doctor but she has never been through a regeneration. ...Im really not sure what to say to that. She has dealt with other regenerations but shes never dealt with a regeneration? Alright man sure.gtAll she needed was time to cool off and forgive the DoctorOffscreen.

4343720,0,t1_csdr3xm,Same experience for me too hated Tate at first loved her by the end of S. Some of that change of heart was obviously due to the hilarity Tate was able to bring to the table particularly as her and Tennant worked together in a few key scenes such as the DonnaTen miming scene which Tate improvised or the scene where Ten is poisoned and plays an impromptu game of charades with Donna to find him an antidote. Ive believed for years that Tate forced Tennant to raise his own game resulting in an unforgettable DoctorCompanion mix.Some of it was due to the storyline and how RTD wrote Donnas character. Some of it was due to how Tate played her.One other thing that I believe is important to note when The Runaway Bride was filmed there was no inkling that Tate would return for a full season. The writers directors producers actors even Tate herself believed that this one special episode was going to be it. So the Donna we saw in that first episode? That was Donna that was what we were going to get and that was all we were going to get. Thats the entire Donna character full stop.Note Bernard Cribbins character in Voyage of the Damned originally named Stan Mott was also not intended to be a recurring character.As it happened Tate was eventually set to return as a fulltime companion in S. Many of us absolutely didnt want this the Donna of TRB was awfully abrasive and harsh. Many viewers believed she had a complete lack of chemistry with the Doctor. To their credit RTD and the rest recognized that they had a problem. Donna Nobles shrillasfingernailsonachalkboard voice ... and an even filteredforfamilyTV version of Catherine Tates personality just wasnt going to appeal to most viewers. No for S they had to humanize Donna and make her character more sympathetic. But how?Heres how I see it. They started by transferring many of her unpleasant mannerisms overbearing bossy complaining etc. to her mother ... fully realizing that while the earlier Donna would aggressively return hectoring or belittling in kind with interest ... well the new Donna wouldnt. Instead shed take it ... this is her mother after all its natural. Many of us have been there and we have the teeshirts.Secondly and more importantly IMO S would explore Donnas wonderfully warm relationship with her dad as he stargazes in the backyard DAD? ... yes I said dad wait for it see below the  if you dont already know all about this.Anyway I believe that those things went a long way to helping the audience identifysympathize with Donna even as S began. Starting from a quite unenviable position Donna eventually landed in the hearts of many as a truly awesome DW companion.gt warm relationship with her dad But ... Wilf wasnt Donnas father? Yes  that is true Donnas father Geoff Noble was played by Howard Attfield in The Runaway Bride. Both of Donnas parents were due to return in S but sadly Attfields cancer worsened and proved to be terminal after filming only a few scenes for S.This left DW with a big problem. Do they just throw out all the new scenes with Donnas father? Do they replace Attfield with another actor? Neither of those were appealing.It was producer Phil Collenson who broached the idea of bringing back a smallpart character from Voyage of the Damned Bernard Cribbins Stan Mott the guy selling newspapers and having him do the Geoff Noble scenes ... except the scenes would be rewritten for Donnas grandfather whod be renamed Wilfred Mott RTDs idea. The absence of Donnas father Geoff was explained by his TV death inuniverse which also explains why Donna moved back in with her mother. Wilfs absence at his granddaughters wedding was explained by him being sick at the time with the Spanish Flu. RTD even managed to work in some continuity with Wilf and his earlier scene with Ten in Voyage of the Damned by having Ten remember meeting him then.,gallifrey,csf9o4z,2,t5_2tf29

4641393,0,t3_3ejb14,For me youre halfway to why I dont care for Clara. I absolutely agree that theres some distaste for her that stems from not getting her outlook toward traveling with the doctor but for me theres a little more to whats rubbing me the wrong way about her character.I agree with several others on here that her intro to the series was excellent I loved the mystery surrounding the question of her very existence. Since shes become the regular companion and her mystery is long since past her character seems to revolve around being a contrarian similar to a petulant child or stereotypical moody teenager who says Ok Ill join you in doing x y and z... but I wont have any fun while we do it.Additionally although not specifically Clara related the show has recently taken a This Is Your Life turn since Claras introduction a large number of episodes have either revisited older episodesthemes or recycled a previous episodes storyline.  Weve already met a girl who has a complicated relationship with a man ClaraDanny seem like the free trial version of AmyRory Deep Breath was a roundabout continuation of The Girl in the Fireplace Mummy on the Orient Express was pretty reminiscent of Midnight and Flatline was awfully similar to Fear Her.  None of this directly influences my dislike of Clara but when my spideysense starts tingling that Ive seen an episode before it makes it that much harder to relate or care about the characters involved which in turn builds or at least leaves more room for distaste to grow.,gallifrey,ctfm47r,5,t5_2tf29

In fact the Power of the Daleks the story that has to prove that the idea of regeneration is even feasible has Troughton play the Doctor as a shifty mysterious and suspicious character for much of it and considering the number of regenerations since then it seems to have worked.

On two countsOne your two lead actors arguably because of the show are now global superstars and finding time between Cumberbatchs movies and Fargo and all their other stuff is incredibly difficult. If they really wanted to do the show they would have made time to do it and fitted their other roles around thatTwo your lead writerproducer is also the lead writer of your other major drama moneyspinner. Getting him to do the pair of them at the same time is going to harm one or the other in this case both actually with the insane gaps between Sherlocks seriesand the unnecessary splits in Series  and . He should be respectfully asked to do one or the other not both for the sake of the shows more than anything elseWhen both of those factors are in play dropping Sherlock is the obvious choice. And that certainly wouldnt effect its cult status just look at Firefly.

4795618,0,t1_ctyzg9v,From the sounds of your reply and as a newcomer to this subreddit does this topic get brought up a lot?I agree though Id love to see a female Doctor and my only caveat is that I dont know if I would want Moffat writing for a female Doctor. He errs towards writing female characters as overly witty and sometimes a little smarmy and I say this as much preferring Moffats tenure over RTDs. I think this whole discussion is ridiculous though. When the Doctor possibly jokingly mentions that he can regenerate into having three heads or no heads and people are arguing about gender thats silly. Hes an alien what bearing does it have on us if he changes gender? The first  Doctors are male for pretty obvious reasons TV patriarchy for  and then with a reboot of the show you have to introduce it back to the audience in the way that they remember it so they brought back a grumpy male lead and gave him some angst. From then on they could do whatever they want. Two Scotsmen and the youngest actor to play the Doctor. Not really pushing the boundaries but if they got a black actor who was good enough for the part would you begrudge them that just because he or she is black and the Doctors always been a white guy? No because that doesnt make any sense acting ability is the only thing worth measuring here. Does this actor seem like the Doctor could this actor represent the playfulness the responsibility the guilt the intellect and the craziness that all the other Doctors have had in different ratios of course?

4859558,0,t3_3hg2s3,So I loved The Defectors when I first heard it although I did think it was a little heavy handed with the you are different from my Doctor stuff. And although it did have a bit of that Third Doctor feel it felt a little too abbreviated like they rushed through the adventure and the reveal. As such I think it could have been better the Seventh Doctor had been thrust more into the thick of it rather than switching at a slower moment.I think I liked the story of the Last of the Cybermen a bit less but I enjoyed the interactions a bit more. I think this is in part because Colin Baker and Frazer Hines already have a strong history working with each other and have built up a great rapport with each other.In a kind of sad and unexpected way The Secret History kind of lowered my opinions of the first two installments just a bit. This is because The Secret History was so amazing and the themes and issues explored in it were a bit grand and connected in a way that makes the other two seem a bit hollow. I still like the first two but I wish they had connected them into the trilogy a little bit more somehow although how I do not know because revealing the person responsible too soon could have easily lessened the impact a bit.,gallifrey,cu730ya,2,t5_2tf29

4897633,0,t3_3hthjr,Well the biggest problem with Time Lord society and some form of gender fluidity is that its written by people that arent gender fluid. We simply cant comprehend what a gender fluid society would be like. Because Time Lords arent just gender fluid theyre species fluid.Then we get into questions of how they reproduce. How would a Time LordLady who regenerated into the species of a Mondasian reproduce with a Time LordLady who reproduced into the species of hyper intelligent vapour?Then theres the issue of how a family unit would work. Assuming a Gallifreyan Time couple give birth to their Gallifreyan child how would their development be impacted by having your father turn into an Abzrobaloff and your mother turns into a butterfly?Regeneration is not a natural process that Gallifreyans evolved. Its an artificial process performed by Time Lords. So those issues would need to be tightly contained and conditions introduced. Somebody equated it to dying your hair. Something that wouldnt necessarily change your identity for those prepared. Which is what I consider to be true.However look at Earth basically everyone has the ability to change their hair colour yet its only a tiny minority that actually do. And in comparison to changing ethnicity which I would class as going from something like brunette to blonde changing gender would be like going from brunette to pink.I think Time Lords stick primarily to their own species and gender simply because they want to.I also firmly believe the Master regenerated into a female Gallifreyan purely to mess with the Doctor for a little bit. ,gallifrey,cubvvzi,1,t5_2tf29

5441277,0,t1_cw73khr,OK let me try this again hopefully without firefox crashing and losing my post  Also forgive me for rambling a bit I just started typing and well...That is basically most of the theory.  It could be that Clara dies from some as yet unseen by us event or it could be the paradox the Doctor created in Before the Flood.Some people have speculated that he might find Gallifrey in the finale but the Time Lords are like no fuck you fix that paradox shit right the hell now before you come home and Clara must die.  That MIGHT have even happened from his perspective and hes STILL trying to do everything he can to save her.  Also if they DO that and retcon almost the entire season I will send Moffat roses because hahaha thats frickin hilarious and he is the best heel ever.Curious that he got his current face from his tenth incarnation picking at the edges of a Fixed Point AND right after realizing that is where his face came from he gives a  big FUCK YOU speech to ??????   this is either a flash of Ten and his Time Lord Victorious attitude and is directed at the Time Lords who have decreed that Clara must die OR just an old man saying FUCK YOU IM THE DOCTOR to the sky.  EIther is possible.Whatever happens the Doctor KNOWS that bad things lie ahead for Clara whether he has already experienced those events in his timeline or not.  He keeps bringing it up and she keeps blowing it off.I also think that in the back of his head he remembers Tens run in with Davros and the charges that Davros leveled at him and he knows on some level hes right. gtThe man who abhors violence never carrying a gun but this is the truth Doctor you take ordinary people and you fashion them into weapons...Who was the last companion that ended up better after their time with him?

If that happened the higher tier took precedence and the lower tier work was considered noncanon regardless of which came first. For Doctor Who the hierarchy would probably be something like TVgtBig FinishgtBooksgtComics though Im not sure whether comics or books would be higher. My guess is books.I suppose it would depend on which one TV or Big Finish referenced more often both being clearly higher tier. Since Im not really into the books or comics beyond a few exceptions Im not the best person to answer than question.Its up to you entirely to decide how you want to handle it since there is no official stance but thats one way to keep it straight.,gallifrey,cwdeqvx,7,t5_2tf29

5513816,0,t3_3qixt3,I have a vision for the Christmas episode based on a single line from last seasons Death in Heaven where Kate Stewart describes herself as a mother of two.  The Doctor Kate Stewart and her two children go off on an adventure.What I imagine Kate Stewarts childhood being like is from the beginning she wished to be like her father.  So the Brigadier taught her everything about survival until one day when she was  he took her to some deserted wilderness gave her a knife and told her hed be back in three weeks to see if she had survived.  And she did barely because of what she had learned from him and he and she afterwards knew she could always have survived it.  She was good enough to fulfill her destiny to be his successor.But times are different.  Kate Stewarts children are perhaps early teens and they have no idea what they want to do if they want to follow in her footsteps.  She has tried her best to teach them some things but she has her extreme doubts they could survive the type of ordeal her father put her through.  Meanwhile the Doctor on Christmas after seeing to his other duties he has promised others is lonely and perhaps he has very rare and hard to get tickets for some mysterious family experience that always seems to result in children who achieve greatness in good and compassionate ways.  And then he remembers Kate Stewart and her two children ...,gallifrey,cwgfv1v,1,t5_2tf29

5807777,0,t1_cxgsgnr,The thing is the teleporter problem as classic of a philosophical thoughtexperiment it is is solved if you imagine that the being is converted into energy bits and both the bits and the energy are sent. A disassembly and reassembly version of teleports rather than a kill and clone teleporter. Star Trek is a good example of how the teleporter issue could be circumvented and I usually watch scifi imagining the disassembly and reassembly version of teleports. Heaven Sent challenged this for me but I built a head cannon to get rid of the issue for myself. I was doing some wiki diving last night on the issue because I thought the way most teleporters were written in Scifi were ways to fix this problem. For example the transporters in Star Trek. They beam you up literally. Its not a copy of you its all the atoms of you compacted into energy sent quickly into space and decompacted back into mass in the ship. This is why in the Star Trek movie getting the exact location and acceleration of the person transported is so vital.However the Star Trek television series is unclear about the exact nature of their technology. Ill quote what I found in my wiki divegtKrauss notes that The Star Trek writers seem never to have got it exactly clear what they want the transporter to do. Does the transporter send the atoms and the bits or just the bits? He notes that according to the canon definition of the transporter the former seems to be the case but that that definition is inconsistent with a number of applications particularly incidents involving the transporter which appear to involve only a transport of information for example the way in which it splits Kirk into two version in the episode The Enemy Within or the way in which Riker is similarly split in the episode Second Chances. Krauss elaborates that If the transporter carries both the matter stream and the information signal this splitting phenomenon is impossible. The number of atoms you end up with has to be the same as the number you began with. There is no possible way to replicate people in this manner. On the other hand if only the information were beamed up one could imagine combining it with atoms that might be stored aboard a starship and making as many copies as you wanted of an individual.Star Trek doesnt clearly deconstruct the problem but it could. Basically I think its a common issue in scifi writing thats solved by imagining the teleporter not as a killing and cloning machine but a disassembly and reassembly machine. Theres still the problem of what if I teleport but am stored as data for  years or where do I go when Im teleported? but not the problem of what if Im copied the teleport cant actually recreate you it because it doesnt have the extra energy or the data for the new you. The killing and cloning poses even more problems than the simple what is consciousness issue. It raises questions about the conservation of mass and the limits of knowledge and technology. Imagine youre trying to teleport the Rarest Molecule in the universe from Planet X to Planet Y. Obviously Planet Y does not yet have the materials to create this molecule. Sure a teleporter might know the molecular structure of you down to the degree of every atomic bond but that doesnt mean it has all those atoms available on hand. Unless we imagine that teleporters use a sort of quantum copy amp paste where they copy the data on not an atomic level but a quantum level. In this case we need the Rarest Molecule from Planet X in order to know the quantum structure. The killing and copying teleporter would copy the quantum data destroy the original and reconfigure quarks on Planet Y to recreate the Rarest Molecule. But why imagine this limit? Why would need to destroy the original or stop at just create one? Go along this line of questioning far enough and youll ask yourself why dont they just advanced to the levels of Gods and find out how to build their own elements from the quantum level? Also we can imagine Time Lords with their relationship to the Time Vortex as a sort of Rarest Molecule. You know how when Time Lords die they leave behind Tears in the Time Vortex? Thats some heavy stuff. Thats some stuff Im sure plenty of aliens want their hands on. If the Doctor Who universe uses kill and clone teleports all those aliens need to do in order to uncover the secret of the time lords is reverse engineer the information in their teleporters.So usually I watch scifi imagining the disassembly and reassembly idea for teleports. In this the teleport only needs the energy and the data. It doesnt need to understand why energy is shaped in the way it is it only needs to reconfigure it. What unsettles me about last nights episode is that the old problem is brought back up.Now I know this isnt that big of a deal it is a classic scifi thought experiment after all. It was used hear for an amazing plot twist.  But like OP said we still have the so is this really our doctor then? question. And though normally the question is a simple Well humans are just matter anyway this time were dealing with a Time Lord. If the Doctor really died shouldnt there be a time rift time vortex left behind think Name of the Doctor?And now Im wondering if ALL the teleports in the Doctor Who universe work in the killing and cloning method rather than the disassembly reassembly method. Again this raises the question of the Time Vortex. If the teleporters work by cloning does that mean they recreate the Time Vortex and regeneration energy within the Doctor each time he teleports? Doesnt that raise some problems? In the Sontaran Sky episode with  for example the Sontarans could now create an army of Doctors kill them and study the Timelord energy. Or they could hack the teleporter to only recreate one cell of the Doctor Im sure one cell of a Timelord would lead to a crazy amount of scientific advances.My head canon is this The teleporters still work in the disassembly ressambly method but because the Confession Dial works by resetting the rooms it resets fully the teleport. Meaning it resets both the bits information and the energy the real Doctor. Its not that all teleporters in the Doctor Who universe work in the killing and cloning basis but that the nature of the confession dial kept the energy of the Doctor as he originally was. Perhaps the Timelords purposefully built it this way so they could get more confessions out of him if needed. Theoretically though if the Doctor had something else to burn could he have released a copy of himself? IDK. I guess we also have to keep in mind this is Timelord technology.tldr The Teleporter Problem is more than just the problem of materialism it quickly complicates scifi worlds if you really think about it. So instead I imagine that scifi worlds use a convert into energy transport convert into matter method. This episode challenged that for me. So I came up with a head canon involving the resetting nature of the confession dial. ,gallifrey,cxh0cwq,12,t5_2tf29

Perhaps he was given a suppressed memory that only emerged when he was much older.  Maybe he the th Doctor found a way to communicate with his younger self across this access point. Perhaps an equivalent of the Visionary from The End of Time told him.   Perhaps he found out during the Cloister Wars that Missy mentioned in The Sorcerors Apprentice.A question I have about any such revelation of doom is why wouldnt the Doctor have assumed that his part in destroying Gallifrey would have been foretold as the events of the Time War?

5873178,0,t1_cxpevr1,Thats a cool observation. For instance when they tried to add in Rory and Amys marital troubles it felt weird because companion personal drama was something New Who has done but for them it felt out of place and maybe because it was just stupid who knows Im human and its subjective. And then Clara was pretty much a puzzle from a JJ Abrams script for a whole season and that seriously undercut her as a complex character at least for a while... but it was kind of like the companions of old as you say.Ive got this theory that Moffat is sort of on a tour of Who history as he goes through season by season. Weve even seen  specifically developing from a gruff grumpy old guy to an idiot in a box to a wallpunching action hero all while being . Watch out for a floppy hat next year I suppose and then a cricket ball. Changing Clara from a Classicstyle companion to a New Whostyle companion would be a neat trick.

Its hard to say as there was no definitive answer within the show  shes able to breathe although she doesnt need to and even to cry which should technically be impossible.

Because of the white suit Ive just assumed that the stories took place either during or soon after the NAs but the prerequisite story Colditz is linked to Hex through The Rapture and The Harvest.Of course the stories could take place after Hex instead of Benny the Doctor isnt forced to always wear the same clothes.  A couple of ways I can see the stories taking place before Hex is by having the Doctor pretend to know what Klein is talking about in A Thousand Tiny Wings although I cant remember the details and I have a feeling that option isnt possible or by setting the stories between The Rapture and The Harvest with Ace dropped off somewhere.As of now I see the order as Hex before Benny but I feel like that might change as I read more of the NAs.  One thing I noticed about having Hex after Benny is that it makes a few of Older Sevens comments in some of his solo stories make more sense.  I remember there was a story where he woke up and mentioned Mel Ace and Hex before realizing he was alone and with the new AceMel stories coming at least thats what I assume they are from reading the casting on Vortex that could link in quite nicely.,gallifrey,cyephzy,2,t5_2tf29

6159694,0,t1_cypo7do,I thought Missy came after that though.  As Saxon he opted to die without regenerating and it wasnt really clear whether the resurrected version of him still had those regenerations or not.  Youd think that if he did he would have used one right away to escape the effects of the halfassed resurrection.  But anyway forgetting all that for a second lets say he did still have them and Missy is one of those regenerations.  Still I thought she came after the Saxon version.  What I was wondering is maybe after the resurrected Saxon Master got pulled back into the Time War on its last Day in The End of Time and subsequently regenerated into Missy did she then acquire a TARDIS and travel to other times inside the Time War before escaping it completely to harass the Twelfth Doctor?  Thats kind of what her statement seems to implyI cant see a male version of the Master having referred to himself as the bitch and we dont have any indication that there was any previous female version.  All of this is assuming of course that the confrontation at the Never Vault happened during the war.  But it sounds familiar and I thought it was a time war reference.,gallifrey,cypsl2e,1,t5_2tf29

They dont need a huge plotrelated reason to have a fun twoMaster romp or to bring back a past Doctor for an episode or two beyond this would be a really fun idea for an episode. Just say the timelines are unstable and youre good.A two Master episode would be great because neither would trust the other. It would be a battle between them as much as it would be a battle between the Doctor and the Master. Which incarnations they use dont really matter too much in this regard all the audience has to be told is this is a previous Master which they would say regardless if it was MacQueens Master or Simms Master or Crispy or a brand new one. The show hasnt had one of those episodes yet which is as good a reason as any to do it.Huh...just realized how amusing it is thinking that Doctor Who of all shows should be less linear,gallifrey,cypyb13,1,t5_2tf29

6189538,0,t1_cysz62b,gt Something very important that everyone should understand especially business owners is that potential sales have no value. Thats also not exactly true.  If you take a product that everyone has a need for a limited quantity of and satisfy that needs then that does harm future sales directly which have value.  I appreciate that they dont directly translate to value the way that actual sales do but saying they have no value is misleading at best.If you take a potential customer who is otherwise unable to obtain a good such as someone who is literally unable to afford the cost then that is true that the owner of the intellectual property loses nothing.  However consider this  Customer  is deciding what to do with their disposable income between two products A and B.  Customer  is against stealing either product and will therefore buy A some of the time and B some of the time and while not getting as much of A or B as they want will profit both the makers of A and B.Customer  is deciding what to do with their disposable income between two products A and B.  Product A is an electronic item and thus easily stolen and the chance of getting caught is low while product B is a physical item which Customer  would have to steal in person.  Customer  decides to steal product A some of the time.  When customer  gets an influx of cash they need to decide whether they want to buy A or B.  Since theyve already gotten some A recently and havent had B since the last time they could afford it this predisposes them to buy B.I do agree with you that listening to pirated audio does not directly translate to taking money from Big Finish but pretending its a complete nonentity is also dishonest.,gallifrey,cyt6oo0,10,t5_2tf29

That and Moffat has previously gone on record as saying that they wouldnt purposefully instate a  fresh start on the new showrunner because it would be too much added pressure trying to initiate another New Doctor New Companion New Showrunner era again. Moffat said theyd probably ease the new showrunner in by keeping the current Doctor on.That said if Capaldi is done after Series  it wont be because of some trivial nonsense that theyre going to have a fresh start with a young Doctor. Itll be because Capaldi is ready to leave and Moffats finale calls for a regeneration. If Capaldi leaves it will be by his and Moffats call.Moffat is in control of the next season and in control of the finale. If Capaldi doesnt regenerate in the finale then hes back for Series .

For those wondering our new few months currently look like thisIve also decided to drop the poll links due to lack of interest.I would like to float a couple of ideas with you guys. Firstly What do we think about doing it more often that is until we get to Classincreased series  discussion.Secondly Torchwood Children of Earth was aired in a single week and is currently set to be spread across  and a half weeks ...although the whole story vs episode thing was a bit annoying.

6847112,0,t1_d0sc4pr,Yeah. Someone from the past who starts up having a really oldfashioned wiew of the world and thinking that God wouldnt permit that much technology and freedom to exist by the thth century. They consider presentday tech to be magic. How about someone from the presentish but another planet? They have enough budget and special effects to pull that off. Yet the Ninth and early Tenth Doctor always spends time either on Earth the Moon a spaceshipspacebase that is built and inhabited by humanshumanlooking aliens pretending to be humansnonhuman looking aliens watching the destruction of Earth or a future Earth colony.In fact at where Im at the only humanlooking people that werent mutatedsavagegenetically enhanced humans are the Haemovore from Smith amp Jones we see only one of them and she couldve gotten extensive plastic surgery to fit in and the Stovians from Voyage of the Damned Even then we dont actually see Sto itself. Maybe in the Christmas special that will be between Seasons  and  since I got the gist that Bayldon Copper would die in  years and then some Stovians Zocci and Vinvocci will arrive on Earth and invadecolonize it while being captained by Alonso Frame on a reconstructed and possibly renamed Space Titanic. even through back in Classic Who a majority of sentient alien species looked exactly or almost exactly like the Gallifreyans. BTW I also got the gist that when theyre not trying to act human the Stovians are your typical Fiveera humanlooking alien species and inuniverse VotD was originally supposed to be a Five story and Awakening was supposed to be a Ten story but Time Crash happened and the polarity was reversed. Jane Hampden wouldve become Tens companion then. Or something. But now many aliens seem to have very alien appearances due to the budget.And yes the Futurekind seem to be a group of savage humans or demihumans with heavily body modification rather than another species entirely.Or how about a companion from a magical worldother plane of existence. Or maybe the Doctor builds his own artificialcyborg companion. Really many parts of the expanded universe have tried a companion or team of companions from different times and place. In Eights book TARDIS team Fitz Kreiner is a germandescent human from the sixties and Compassion is a clone made from th century humans and gallifreyans memories of a girl named Laura Tobin. Yes like Xion from Kingdom Hearts. while in his audio TARDIS team Charley is a British girl from the s and Crizz is a reptilian alien from a timeless pocket universe.Its really only the new series that thinks the companions have to be presentday british humans that turn out to have a special chosen one destiny.,gallifrey,d0sfdmi,2,t5_2tf29

Immediately we are greeted with the gears and the camera is taking a trip through them whirling around corners and generally exploring. We emerge from the gears after a few seconds where we see the TARDIS hovering into view. The current Doctors name pops up ooWEEOOOOOOH. The background is the time vortex. His name vanishes. A sudden sonic pulse and the TARDIS shoots immediately for the background until its too small to see. The camera begins to chase after it the view blurring as it enters the time vortex. The other cast names play.We catch up to the TARDIS and the drums stop. We get the middle eight sung by an angelic choir. The TARDIS is towards the bottom left corner hovering over a beautiful lake surrounded by rocks and waterfalls and a beautiful orange sunset. After the TARDIS passes around a waterfall Arcadia appears in the distance. Its Gallifrey. The logo appears. The TARDIS leaves the view as the camera rises above the city to look up to the sky. The music fades to a quiet level and we hear those three little notes played on some chimes as we see the TARDIS move from right to left across the Gallifreyan sky with the episode title appearing.,gallifrey,d12rtqd,7,t5_2tf29

Boyens and Walsh in conjunction with Guillermo Del Toro.I think the wiki might perhaps be saying that theres nothing hes ever directed that hasnt had some form of writing input by him. But then its worth noting that Directors and Execs often pitch into this thing fairly heavily as it is. As noted above by uDrVesuvius  RTD wrote the majority of Matt Jones twoparter in addition to many other episodes he was not credited on.

8071290,0,t1_d4n9ooh,Im probably going to sound rather like an apologist in saying this let me cover by saying that I think its fine either way as far as whether one likes Moffats era or not  personally Im a huge fan of both his and RTDs runs but Im not trying to dismiss your opinion here but I always have to say it when somebody mentions Orson  the whole point was to leave him ambiguous just like everything else in that episode. Listen is a big old piece on ambiguity and plausible deniability. You say that you hope Chibnall pays a little more attention but that presumes that Moffat didnt pay attention to Orson  when he has said himself that they were very careful to leave his exact nature uncertain. There are ways to explain him  he could be from another branch of the family If it was absolutely a direct relation then why did he ask Er whos Danny? when Clara mistook him for his own supposed greatgrandad? or Missys interference in the modernday indirectly resulting in Dannys death caused that timeline to be overwritten. Which isnt quite the same thing as The Angels Take Manhattan  what that episode claimed is that you cannot enact change on your own personal future if you have witnessed it but Clara wasnt the one mucking about in human history with an artificial afterlife. Missy was and Orson isnt part of her future so her actions can preempt him. Its essentially the same conversation that goes down in every companions first trip into the relative past  where they say But Im from the future and I know Earth didnt get destroyed by Krynoids in  so its going to be fine right? and the Doctor explains to them that time can shift  the alien invaders arent connected to the people and places the modern companion has seen so they can enact change.But more importantly those are only supposed to be plausible alternatives. Ultimately Orson isnt meant to have any one explanation as that goes against what Listen was trying to accomplish.,gallifrey,d4nafnd,7,t5_2tf29

8205099,0,t3_4rpouj,The sheer mastery of audio in Scherzo is just brilliant. It used sound in a creative and unique way and it really paid off. The use of repetition both of events and of voicessounds also calls back to The Chimes Of Midnight my other favorite Big Finish audio. While it wasnt quite a time loop this time around similar to how Heaven Sent wasnt yet it still falls into this same category imo and is likely my favorite TV episode of the show it managed to create an amazing and unsettling atmosphere because of it. Maybe Im just a sucker for repetition and loop stories.So now youre in the Divergent Universe arc  while it doesnt quite live up to the potential Neverland promised likely due to the fact that it was cut early because New Who started and they wanted to have more of a clean slate for the inevitable influx of new listeners who might not want to be thrown into the middle of a weird and plot heavy arc though I never really bought this wouldnt they start at the beginning regardless? At least it led to the Eighth Doctor Adventures it still has some really great audios in it.

Working with the Time Lords again doing missions is an interesting idea but is probably a backdoor pilot for Doctor Donna and the Time Corps. Regenerative Decay is an interesting macguffin. I dont expect it to last though. Vashda Narada and Weeping Angels hunting together? Im cautiously optimistic.  had a hell of an introduction traveling the TARDIS five minutes back over and over again to evacuate the entire space colony. The Alchemist was an alright character if introducing literal magic into the universe for a season was a bit much. Kyle. Wasnt he the coolest?Hate s introduction is with  literally getting stabbed in the back and she has to finish out the story? Lame. They spent the entire episode waiting for a Pizza in the TARDIS! I know it was a bottle episode but do they know its a time machine? Okay the Japan episode was nice for the most part but the Magical Girl transformation sequence was over the top.

Its definitely worth watching.The first season was about using time travel to try to eliminate the virus which is later revealed to have been created as part of a plan to destroy time.

8825921,0,t3_510wbs,My feeling is that the War Doctor while more the Warrior than the Doctor was still... the Doctor. He cant ever escape who he really is. In the end hes still trying to save as many people who dont deserve what might happen to them as possible.So he probably never walked into a situation with a gun. But sometimes maybe a lot of times... Solider Im going to need your gun.Even if he was completely totally unarmed you can shed a lot of blood without ever firing a shot yourself and you can justify a lot of what happened based on how to tell yourself you walked in to the scenario. The Doctor is a master manipulator. The War Doctor probably had slightly less immediate conscience about it. Though Im sure the things he did had a significant impact on how  in particular felt about themselves later. He hated himself every time he took up arms or convinced someone else to take up arms on behalf of the greater good. He as the War Doctor was the Doctor when it was impossible to be the Doctor.I say this based mostly on my onscreen watching and partial Big Finish listening impressions of his various incarnations. I really should dig into the the WD BF stuffHurts Doctor felt like he was strongly in denial of being the Doctor while still being the Doctor.

Snarkiness aside I actually have little to no problem with the scripts at all. In fact I found them to be often far in and away better in quality than much of what had come before. Or maybe it just seemed fresh. Specifically about Robots of Sherwood I found it was a fine way to resolve the story. Yes it was totally ridiculous but it is what you would expect from a childrens story. And that is what the episode was it was a childrens story. It had a very important message about how real our heroes need to be I agree but look at the entire atmosphere of the episode the bantering Merry Men the dashing hero Robin the moustache twirling villain of the Sheriff  it was not meant to be a serious adult story. And that contrasts with the serious and adult mindset of the th Doctor at the time. Being able to save the world with such an over the top and improbable method was part of the th Doctors journey to discover who he was. ,gallifrey,d8hsfon,1,t5_2tf29

Attack of the Cybermen is one of the better Cybermen stories imo and rounded off the Lytton story.Ironically the Two Doctors was probably the weakest of that season imo and was too long and we lost no. early on really. Didnt like the Androgums but at least we got the great Frazer Hines back on the showThe Trial showed Colin as the great actor he is and even Vervoids is an enjoyable rompSoall in all we had a Doctor not being too nice having a darker sidewanting to retire meeting a female Timelord and having  minute episodes.Sounds familiar doesnt it?Oh!!!!

Its smart and it works and it is also confirmed by the fact that Capaldi was offered the role some years ago by Moffat but declined it  have I got that right?  Could be that Moffat has said in interviews that he considered Capaldi for the Doctor once before but didnt offer.  The point is Moffat had a Capaldi Doctor in mind the way say Ballanchine might have a Suzanne Farrell as principal dancer in mind for a particular ballet so Capaldi in  was the best fit for a Capaldishaped Doctor set of stories that Moffat had in mind.  Makes sense to me as a kind of creative spiral over some time.Still a show runner might spot a female actor who suggests an interesting DW season arc and not act on that until several years later when the whole concept fits much better and then planning for a female Doctor played by that actor begins.,gallifrey,d9dk2x8,1,t5_2tf29

Interested to see how that goes and who the headmaster really is and it was properly DW level intriguing. The commentary about Charlies POV is good too. Other thoughtsThere were too many little threads trying to be picked up in this episode Moffat does that a lot too and the flower thing ended up feeling a bit forced in although obviously its needed for next weeks episode. Either too many good ideas or not enough complete ones this week well find out the verdict on that next week I suppose. Too bad April didnt just slice open the universe and throw a flower petal through. That would have been easier. The end of the episode was a little too His Dark Materials meets The Lord of the Rings.

9743987,0,t1_dadu63z,I personally agree. I think it was abundantly clear during The Caretaker that the Doctor had a paternal sort of love for Clara taking it as a massive compliment when he assumed she was interested in the teacher who looked like his younger self. If it was still a romantic sort of love then he would have been more likely to have seen the young man as a rival.Having said all thatI am quite sure that both Moffat and RTD quite deliberately left the nature of the Doctors relationships with his companions open to interpretation. If you want to believe that theres a romance there theres plenty of evidence to find. If youd rather not believe it you dont have to.

Which IMO perfectly suits a program thats always been more fantasy than science and probably always will be.  Of course I have a bias I care about all those other things more than scientific realism in a fictional spacetime adventure story too.  I enjoy caring about being surprised and enlightened by following the internal maturation of these fictional travelers.  I go to The Martian and its like for fascinating reasonably accurate science because although thats pretty much all there is the characters are  thin because theyre addons to the sequence of technical problems to be solved.

10556488,0,t3_5r5wzg,Well this was... unexpected. I figured it would release tomorrow which I suppose it technically did as it IS the st in the U.K. but I wasnt expecting it until the normal time. Oh well.This has been one that Ive been excited for ever since it was announced. Id be happy to call Liv my favorite Eighth Doctor companion in the audios and I think Nicola Walker is a brilliant actress. Also judging from the trailer it seems to be in a similar style to last years A Full Life being a oneperson play rather than a straight audio book reading. So Im quite excited for this one!Review will be up shortly.The World Beyond the TreesIn the opening Short Trips story for  Liv Chenka Nicola Walker wakes up from a deeply confusing dream to find everyone in a lethargic state. Everyone except for one young girl whos a long way from home and who bears a striking similarity to Liv. The World Beyond the Trees is a decidedly average story it attempts to be a forebear to Absent Friends from Doom Coalition  in some ways but falls flat due to a rather boring script. Not even Walkers strong performance can save this story from mediocrity.Nicola Walker does a good job here narrating the story. As I said in my preview above this story is unlike most of the other Short Trips releases and instead is similar in style to the Companion Chronicles with Walker actually acting as Liv rather than just reading the script in a traditional audio book reading. This gives the story a bit more life allowing Walker to show her range here and allowing her to give insights into the character that only the actor playing her could accurately portray. And Walker does give a great performance here helped in part giving insights into Livs relationship with Molly and her feelings on being in the past injecting some actual emotions into the story throughout. However while Nicola Walkers performance here was strong I found that Jonathan Barnes script was rather lacking here. The story felt incomplete honestly and while I thought Barnes did a great job giving backstory to the character of Liv it almost seems like he forgot he had to write a story not just character development. The Lilla plot that drove the story forward felt hastily done and incomplete. I think that this story couldve benefited from even five minutes of backstory for Lilla and her father rather than just quickly flashing through their reasons for leaving and for Lilla ending up in this situation. The entire plot with an Millieure alien showing up at the end felt tacked on to the story and the dream sequence that kicked off the main plot had no meaning other than being a treasure map to get to the end of the story. It really feels like this story was a pilot of sorts for Absent Friends with Liv finally being able to contact her father and tell him goodbye but in practice this story just didnt work for me plotwise.Overall The World Beyond the Trees was a bland start to the  run of Short Trips. Nicola Walker gave a strong performance but writer Jonathan Barnes delivered an exceedingly bland script overall. It started out solid with some nice character work for Liv but quickly petered out into nothing which was disappointing. The story itself felt incomplete and even more pointless than most Short Trips releases leading to a rather disappointing story overall. Final Grade ,gallifrey,dd4p3wf,2,t5_2tf29

Nor was it being a YA series the problem  theres no reason a Doctor Who spinoff aimed at teens and young twentysomethings could not have worked.

11658848,0,t1_dgg9hj7,Look it wasnt great but youre greatly simplifying it. Remember that The Master created a network that broadcast to the entire populations minds. The Doctor reversed it timeywimey and used that energy to undo the artificial aging. It was more than just a  group of people singing kumbaya.,gallifrey,dghjmr8,1,t5_2tf29

11686661,0,t1_dgkco41,Ive been seeing this same argument all over this subreddit as of recent. Some are ready and willing to just move on and see people as people and others believe there are groups that need to catch up first.The things you describe are unheard of to me but I can see youre being genuine in your beliefs. Maybe you are used to different peoplecommunities than me or something.Color and gender may not matter to me and we cant prove if the BBC is solely looking for white men to be the Doctor but on the other hand I wonder why the BBC wouldnt just publicly confirm that theyd consider a female or black Doctor just so we can be sure unless if they dont I guess.Im going to be the guy with faith keeping in mind how much the show owes to Verity Lambert and Waris Hussein and stick to believing that purposely choosing a femaleblack doctor just for the sake of look we did it now is basically like writing your political ideals over the Mona Lisa.I have faith Chibnall chooses his Doctor with wisdom and love for the series whatever their skin color or role in reproductive cycle is. It hardly matters for a Time Lord anyway.,gallifrey,dgkp8b2,1,t5_2tf29

11697641,0,t1_dglcu8m,Dont forget the Movellans! Never forget the Movellans! Such a small little bit of the episode but when they enter the warzone I instantly recognised the aliens with dreadlocks. Some context  the Movellans will be an Android race that overthrew their creators standard Evil AI scenario and end up entering into a war with the Daleks. My personal headcanon places them in the Andromeda galaxy. Additionally this will be around and before the year  I believe. Well the two sides are perfectly matched and their supercomputers reach perfect stalemates to the point where not a single shot gets fired. The daleks decide the only way to win is by throwing in human error  chaos and random chance and probability. So they decide to revive their longdead creator and inventor Davros. What follows is most all of the Dalek stories set in the s.But yeah Im feeling lots of hints towards Classic Who here and Im so excited for this season.,gallifrey,dgly2ir,8,t5_2tf29
