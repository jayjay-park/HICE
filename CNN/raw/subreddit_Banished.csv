243570,0,t1_cf5zas5,Feed tea to the uneducated they become as productive as the educated while on it.You really need to build a barn and start food production wherever you create a house such as by the new foresters lodge otherwise you will have your foresters and woodcutter travelling all the way back to town to get food this could easily cut productivity in half if not more.Also I dont know on what basis you decided to demolish the first foresters lodge. We dont have any certain data that having no foresters around a gatherer hunter or herbalist is going to help things. I think in the long term having a forester hunter gatherer and herbalist right in the same spot is going to get the maximum returns both in terms of food and herbs and logs. I think it is a huge waste not to be using the logs by the first foresters lodge especially now that you have a bigger log problem than food problem.You should really start making a quarry too.,Banished,cf5zxxd,3,t5_2wp64

So balancing how many treas get taken to how many are planted might could be done with how many works that particular location has maybe instead of  keep it  and you have old growth more readily available. i have to test this out though. Herbs should be collect and you should keep the herbalist employed year round that citizen also acts as the healer no herbalist no healing.

There are some things it does differently that are better than Anno like having stats for individual citizens and tracking the resource distributions in buildings more comprehensively and I would love that stuff to be added to Anno.  Other than that though I miss the variety of structures the advancement to higher level citizens and how the structures change over time the multiple tech trees and civs and competition with other players on the map.  And of course playing with the complex trade routes and fighting pirates.  Of course I realize Banished is a one man game and it is remarkable.

The question goes to the scale of the game I think the scale is rather obviouslly city building not village building. I dont have really intimate control over the activities of my villagers. I cant control where they live or what jobs they take or who they marry or when they have children. All those would make for an interesting game but that is not what we have.We have a city builder. In a city builder the job of the player is to manage resources in broad strokes with the focus on expanding the city laying down buildings and roads preparing terrain and general planning. The level of attention and focus that must be provided to the trade depot is out of whack with the attention that must be paid to everything else in the game.

More people means more food needed.You then went low on food so a lot of your farmers werent harvesting full time but instead spend time walking home to eat since they didnt got food the last time they were home. Because of your farmers not harvesing fully you didnt get enough food for the coming year. More and more people died farmers spend even less time farming and everything just went kaboom.I know this problem well. Avoid it by relying less on farms and more on constant food supplys like fish hunter gather livestock. Later in the game when you HAVE to use large amounts of farms to get the food around  citizens you have little choise use the town hall to constantly monitor your food graph.

410952,0,t1_cfmtylj,Confirming this as a viable alternative. You only need one forester in a growonly hut too so the hub doesnt need as many workers. The superthick forest makes both the herbalist and gatherer pay off in spades. A gatherer can still function pretty well paired with a forester set to cut and plant but youll find your herb production hit rock bottom as herbs need fully mature trees to grow in any good numbers and foresters cut down trees once they reach full maturity. I normally do two forest hubs one with forester set to cut with a gatherer hunter and woodcutter. Another one with a nocut forester plus gatherer hunter and herbalist. ,Banished,cfnd0qs,2,t5_2wp64

The fact that you cant prioritize which professions get priority on tools is bad too.With both of these challenges there was also no education meaning that the people were even slower since uneducated workers are much less efficient.

It looks more industrial than most other screenshots and whether or not its better I think its good to show a different way to play the game.,Banished,cg7hu8z,12,t5_2wp64
592079,0,t3_20wwwf,Yes.  This and. Let us set a minimum to leave in storage where traders wont take out of storage if its below this amount.  For example you could set a minimum of  firewood and traders will take any excess firewood over  to the trading posts but stop taking when the firewood gets below .  This would make it a lot easier to manage.. An option to have tradesmen try to balance resources in different ports.  If you have a max firewood of  in two ports and one port has  firewood and the other has  they should priorize the port with less or even take some from the port with  and move it to the second port.. An option to autobuy both when a tradesman arrives and leaves instead of one or the other so you can autobuy on arrival then autobuy again with what has been restocked when the trader leaves.. An option to change autobuy priority both in the order you buy things and the order in which you trade them instead of autobuying and trading in alphabetical order.  For example I might want both logs and stone but want stone more than logs so if I dont have enough to trade for both Id rather take the stone.  If I have both firewood and food in the post its much better to trade food since not all traders take it.,Banished,cg7kn84,9,t5_2wp64
593756,0,t3_20xiga,Stone houses is the big one for this. Getting enough firewood to fuel a wood house town is a major headache.Another thing is to not clear forests unless youre going to build there next. Cut down some trees just mark long  tile wide zones in nearby forests and then give them a few years to grow back before you do it again. That way your laborers or farmers in the summer and winter can provide a semiregular supply of wood. Trees seed more trees so forests will grow back much faster if you leave them mostly intact. A clearcut forest takes forever to grow back.,Banished,cg7riht,3,t5_2wp64

That could be true for food so if youve got stocked barns in one location but no food in another theyd still go to the market.

834446,0,t1_cgz34nh,thanks for the reply. That is a big help. I also found out about multiple hunting huts being able to hunt the same area. I am going to move my hunting cabins to their own areas and setup a few hunting cabins next to each other. I am also going to remove my gatherers huts and replace them with more farms. I still have plenty of land to build farms on however it would involve another expansion area which I need to plan out. I do like having a ton of extra food as I can expand and not worry about a food shortage. One time I expanded way too fast and myfood went from K to K. That would have been devestating if I didnt have an absurd amount of stored food. I figure right now I could get to a pop of  and keep food stabilized. I also have a large lake that I can surround with fisherman to bring in a little bit extra food.Next I just need to figure out the wood trade economy thing and get that going. ,Banished,cgz4nar,1,t5_2wp64

If you use the tool to give priotiry to B the new order become B A C. If you then use the tool on C it will becomes C B A.Whatever you used the tool last on gets the highest priority followed by whatever you used the tool on before that etc. followed by any buildings you didnt use the tool on in the order that you placed their foundations.Before the most recent patch ANY buildings placed before you loaded a saved file would automatically have the highest priority and the tool had no effect on this. You would have to cancel the buildings youd already planned to change their priority manually. This was also the case for harvesting wood iron and stone from the environment.

Second they still make babies so its an excellent building to start with and still get population growth.

1741545,0,t3_2eeajo,Simple allow anything to be sold at any time in exchange for currency.  The price that a merchant will pay you for said item however will vary. I.e. I have  wheat and I set a price to sell them for a minimum of  shillings apiece.  A merchant comes along willing to buy for  shillings apiece nothing happensB merchant comes along willing to buy for  shillings apiece they are sold for  based on the price I set earlier. It becomes a bit of a game of risk seeing as you want to get the best price for your goods and yet you also want them to actually sell.  The prices that merchants are willing to pay can also be dynamically changing but that could be another project.The same thing works in reverse when buying.  You have price points set to buy a given item at a certain price and only a merchant willing to sell low enough will execute that trade.  Again you have to learn how to drive a bargain.  I could try to buy iron tools for  shillings apiece but if merchants rarely sell them for that much Ill never get them.  I could try to post a high price like willing to pay  shillings for iron tools.  I would always get them but this would quickly drain my fundsUltimately this fixes the problem of certain merchants becoming obsolete.  I.e. once youve unlocked all the seeds or livestock you can care less whenever these guys come around.  Merchants are always useful to some extent but they may also be driving a hard bargain.  Do you pass them up and wait for another risking starvation?  Thatd be fun.,Banished,cjyongq,1,t5_2wp64

1819548,0,t1_ck8azwy,I tried it out the other day and there are still some issues with miningquarrying that make them impractical. In my town I had  mines one coal and one iron plus a quarry. The quarry eats people and barely produces any stone and the villagers use up all of the coal before the blacksmiths can get to it. Even with both mines switched to iron production the miners burn through iron tools ridiculously quickly In my person village with  miners I had  blacksmiths constantly churning out tools and was still constantly running low not to mention that having  people not involved in food production is very hard at that stage if you play in hard mode. In my opinion mines and quarries will only ever be worthwhile if you prevented villagers from using coal for heating halved the rate at which mining tools are consumed and doubled the output of the quarry.,Banished,ck8fvkh,-1,t5_2wp64

The farther distance they are from the school the longer it takes for them to become educated so the closer they are the faster education becomes. If you are city planning a residential zone its always best to put a school in the center to ensure fastest education times.

3596382,0,t3_30bt48,Im kind of in the same boat  not so much questioning now what but rather I have a successful town that I slowly grow at will.I love that this game more or less allows you to control population growth unlike other citybuilding Sim games...So I play very very slowly and very cautiously. My town is going on  years and has fluctuated for the past  or so of those years between  and  population. Eventually there is always a large dieoff followed by another babyboom once there is adequate space in the housing for more children.During the die off years I typically stop farming food simply because the town is eatting less and I already have a decent stockpile saved in barns. I use the remaining people to continue producing tools firewood clothing etc. Any spare laborers I may use to clear large sections of forest since I have quite a few different forester buildings clear cutting  or  of them doesnt hurt.Theoretically I could probably expand my housing to support a population of  but Id rather continue to stockpile my goods. The biggest problem I have is that Im continually building more barns and people are taking longer and longer to deliver  pick up goods becaues the nearby barns are all  full.Once I feel adequatly stocked is the only time I add housing and even then its usually only a few houses here and there each year.My tools clothes iron and coal are all  in reserve my food limit tops off at about  Ive gone  to  years at a time without farming crops and still do just fine with hunters  gatherers  fishing  herdmanThe only thing Ive never been able to stockpile more than a few hundred of is alcohol and herbs. As soon as I get a plethora of herbs my town usually gets sick and runs through them all. Alcohol I have managed to find a happy medium where I might have  I might have  but I dont feel the need to get more than that.Another thing I enjoy doing when removing all my farmers from their crops is to increase my builders to   . I have about  dozen mines sitting paused at  built all across the map probably  houses sitting at  as well trading posts markets etc all near completion. I know that when I feel my town is ready to expand it is literally just a click away all while I continue to save my resources. Ive also managed to install stone pathways spanning over a large portion the entire map connecting all my buildings in the matter of  winter.EDIT Its worth mentioning I am playing with disasters off on a mild climate.EDIT Also since I like to control my population size I never let in any nomads. Id rather have a  educated population then let in those diseased freaks. I dont think Ive let in any nomads since year  and I have no regrets. In the early stage of they game they served their purpose as labors when need be but mostly they just eat all your food and bring diseases.,Banished,cq27pyj,1,t5_2wp64

For example if youre running a gatherers hut with  worker and find yourself running low on food ramping it up to  will provide more food over the short term but theyll harvest everything in the area and that production will cease.In my experience running foresters with  or  is best.

6170704,0,t3_402llc,Might consider placing a resource warehouse plus a large barn near the trader.  Have the resource folks stock commonly traded items and then do a mass release usually to the nearest point the barn.  Traders then might be more effective.Also consider purchasing items for immediate retrade to encourage the haulers.  Dont need hemp pouches or reeds?  Buy them anyhow and keep the quantity in the trading post to trade off immediately.I often trade like this to get rid of low value items I have tons of.  Haulers normally like to trade in other hard goods so trading and keeping a store of off the wall stuff helps.,Banished,cyr1mtg,1,t5_2wp64

6355549,0,t3_42k4te,Banished isnt really a GPU user like other games Its main issue is RAM And CPU Primarily CPU tho.The default vanilla game uses about k RAMmb while CC could jump kim not sure what its at personally i havent played it yet. Anyways You probably wouldnt be able to play the mod if you hit RAM limitations so thats out of the way Tho it wasnt in the way when you said .GHz CPUBanished is a single core game Meaning it only uses  corethread to do all the game calculations. Meaning Your one CPU core at the speed .GHz is doing all the work while the others are idle. This allows you to do other things but also stops your PC from basically crashing due to maxed CPU Usage. Anyways The only way to get around this issue is to upgrade your CPU to atleast  or the newer model .GHz processors. You could even go as far as to buy one thats overclockable and overclock it to .GHzTho be VERY careful with overclocking! Its not something rookies who dont know what there doing should play around with lightly!Also Upon researching your CPU I noticed that its commonly found in Laptops. Laptops are particularly difficult to game with due to power usage Most of the time they go into power saving mode to save power Which will slow down the CPU which could make your game ever slower. ,Banished,czc212i,1,t5_2wp64

10457868,0,t3_5prt3e,The plantations are the same as crop fields as far as efficiency they just allow you to grow materials separately. So you can set production limits on food without it effecting materials.Orchards are less efficient than farms they take years to get started and the trees eventually die and are chopped down which take another few years to be regrown. Orchard seeds are all the same and will produce the same amount no matter which one you choose.Farm seeds however are extremely dependent on what your climate is. You will notice a dramatic difference depending on which one you pick. An x farm with one worker should produce about  food per year if its in a proper climate. If its too hot or cold production could be cut in half or it may not even grow anything at all. For example watermelons grow best in heat and sugar beets grow best if its cold.You only need a variety of meatvegetablesfruitgrain too stay healthy so you only need to pick  seed of each to maintain a healthy diet.Temperature chart,Banished,dcti5wu,2,t5_2wp64
