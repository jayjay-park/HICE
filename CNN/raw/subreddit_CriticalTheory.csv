1313311,0,t3_293r2a,Hmm... Im inclined to think that Bruno Latour would be helpful in bridging the gap between different conceptions of the natureculture dichotomy which I would assume is an implicit issue in your discussion. Be careful not to essentialize the human body though  this is a warning you would have inevitably encountered in Harroway anyway but I figured Id rearticulate it. Part of the dialectics of the human body is precisely the categorization of that term in the first place and the delineation of what qualifies as a human body versus what is transgressive is not just a discourse that arises in the face of technological advancement but also one that results from the postmodern interrogation of biopolitical structures gender race etc.. In that respect I would recommend sections of AntiOedipus or some other text that takes a materialist look at the subjectivities from which we derive conceptions of the body.

There is the really great example of the human resources study he quotes in which the act of clarifying worker complaints particularizes the statements depriving them of their social indictment Wages are too low is clarified as The wage of employee B is too low after the medical emergency of his wife it is technically more accurate but it changes the meaning.  I just keeps going on about historical context but most of his argumentation is negative Wittgenstein is shit etc..  He has a great line like We only understand each other through a clouded universe of misunderstanding and the logical language of the common man proposed by such linguists does not represent actual language and in fact restricts it to oppressionsupporting speech.,CriticalTheory,con0ysp,5,t5_2tmcb
3328385,0,t3_2y5zae,Beyond those that have been mentioned some great theorists who have come up in my studies Im in a religious studies program so this topic is right up my alley include Talal Asad and Saba Mahmood who tend to work with a postcolonial anthropological lens examining secular societies the very Christian roots of secularism in the West and the tensions that this can create with other traditions most notably Islam. Poking around Berkeleys anthropology department will yield more scholars working on similar projects like Charles Hirschkind Randall Styers has done some great work. Hes probably still best known for Making Magic Religion Magic and Science in the Modern World a Foucauldian project looking at how discourses within religious studies constitute the category of magic as a foil to all of the good proper aspects of modernity and how the ambiguity of the category threatens to challenge this distinction and much of the cultural work that rests on it. Winnifred Fallers Sullivan who is only a critical theorist in the broadest of senses but is still a leading authority on problems with religious freedom law she specializes in the U.S. context but makes some points that are broadly applicable and well worth a read for anyone interested in related issues Shes not nearly as big of a name and she focuses more on particular social critiques than on developing theory putting her in the critical theory very broadly construed category along with Sullivan but R.

3520198,0,t3_308y7n,I find some of his examples quite weak  for example while it is certainly true that painting has lost its primacy the importance of a tittle as part of the work far predates the emergence of postmodernism. Just look at canonical modernist works like The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors Even. Equally I find his idea of temporality as a modernist concern a bit odd  video installations are a good example of a category fixed in postmodernity that would seem to be extremely well suited to a Bergsonian approach as Maurizo Lazzerato has shown in his writing on video. Equally many such works have a clear relation to the past  Douglas Gordons engagement with cinema by manipulating the temporal duration of the work. Additionally there are plenty of painters that engage with modernist cannon Ida Ekblad or Fredrik Vrslev for example.I think his treatment of the figure of the curator is far more interesting as a paradigmatic feature  although the criticism of institutions voiced in that section of the text is a little unclear. In any case the section focused on aesthetics has a very narrow outlook in regard to the scope and diversity within artistic production today. ,CriticalTheory,cptj19e,2,t5_2tmcb

7318887,0,t1_d29j57v,Good point about the ants. About ANT not being critical. In one way it isnt at all it is critical of conventional scientific accounts of how facts are made what qualifies as an actor and what doesnt which boundaries to acknowledge. But the critical force of ANT lies in its practice. It is primarily a way of doing research empirical not conceptual. The central claim of ANT in that regard is that it provides a more accurate account of what is going on. For examle lets consider an imaginary ANT study of the political life of weaver ants. This is never just a study of the ants it is how certain entomologists mobilize the ants either a specific colony or the species in general and enters them into a network of civil servents stamping border control forms cause the ants might have to travel to labs documentary makers involving the public philosophers mulling culturenature distinctions. In a way this is weaver ants actornetwork. The ANT point would be weaver ants are nonhuman hybrids whose agency cannot be divorced from the socioculturaltechnological web they have entered ever since having been scientifically classifified.  So the charge of ANT not being critical comes from the Frankfurtstyle critical theory which point out that despite its fanciful rediscriptions ANT is affirming the status quo. That it lacks a normative basis and is ultimately ethically void. I think the last bid might be true but then again ANT recommends itself primarily as an empirical research approach. Something about your comparison to Deleuze. I think there is certaintly an influence in ANT of Deleuze. But ANT is a type of sociology. So as Latour is fond of stating ANT is like its namesake insect myopic ever following trails always on the move. All ANT is casestudies you might say. Anyway personally I think some of the charge of being uncritical might stick to ANTapproach and related fields like STS However I think its original insights are to important to ignore for critical theory proper. I am biased though. Both schooled in Frankfurt School Kritische Theorie and inspired by sociological approaches like ANT ethnomethodology and the sociology of critical practices To end one might imagine a ANT study of classstruggle but it would look vastly different from what it ussually understood by classstruggle. Probably includide detailed analysis of the bureacratic innovations that mediated the notion of class a history of communications media that brought people together as a class and so on and so on...

Its an ethnography of the womens mosque movement in Egypt and a big part of her point in the book is that you cant really entirely separate the ethical the religious and the political.Even if the religious movement youre looking at can be reasonably described as quietist in that it doesnt attempt to influence government policy or gain any kind of political power like the piety movement she studied the formation of a kind of ethical subject is still necessarily and unavoidably the formation of a type of political subject.I think this specific point fits in with the broader observation that uqdatk makes about critical theory generally trying to reveal the political nature of apparently apolitical or private things.,CriticalTheory,d4zp4ex,2,t5_2tmcb

8502764,0,t1_d64b4ck,A lot of banter on Reddit isnt there. But very little inquiring substance just little games and nonsequiturs. My parents were graduates of Balliol the Gramsci Institute and London School of Economics. They became involved in more radical politics than my mothers parents generations Communist Party activity during the s including Potere Operaio in Italy where my mother was sadly raised. During the s New Left wave it was more common to regard academic education as part of the establishment part of the state management of capitalism the production of skilled labour and part of the machinery of ideological production with the family et al. Balliol is easily seen as part of the traditional class system once embedded in education and designed to reproduce it though Linebaughs rendition is vastly selective  actually it had played host to Adam Smith Disreali and Aldous Huxley too. Unrest at the LSE in the lates were part inspired by the institutions links to Vietnam through its governing bodies and academics. My mother wanted to teach in child care and her aunt Elinor had been at the LSE herself and ended up in child development. Her chances were dashed really because she had been lined up for something else. My father was apparently a reluctant academic at all. In the posts capitalist landscape all this has changed. The s rendered a cultural illusion brought about the New Age and new religion the cultural diversification that ended in the yuppies s and neoliberal assimilation of everything. New youth populations are desperate bots of mind control and consumption desperate to cling to the United States and the dollar pathetic little reactionaries and twits desperate for middleclassdom and desperate adherents of state ideology representative voting and the drudge of parties state education and career at very funny juxtaposition with their relationship with child abusing criminal operations the frauds behind commercial power or their own part in the cult network. My parents were trying to build revolutions for what they were worth. Many of them ended up in academia like posthippies who ended up teaching in art school or making films or TV and all those politicians who might have smoked cannabis once and it is here that ideas have ossified. The functional description not that by age helps vastly in my view. I was born in  and surrounded by a program that describes modern capitalism its ideological power information currents twitches and moulding of minds its criminality at one level and its illegality at another its pursuit of hearts and minds. Much of my time has been stolen from me does not reflect choices we made in the free west that isnt free at all. The young look sold to me imprisoned in that quotable Matrix sense at birth in a world they refuse to see but will fight to protect are careless about the nature of freedom here our lives they are chugging down and censoring like good little quacks have lost the real power of dreams they were sold and made into a tshirt.

OK at some level deprivation is not so unchanging either today no running water and crapping in an outhouse would be unacceptably poor it used to be normal. But this is only changing slowly as tech and econ is growng. While unfairness is different you could have an Olympic silver and can feel it is unfair because you deserved the gold more than the one who got it.Not quoting Nietzsche this idea came up on NRx blogs recently perhaps influenced by N. but it is more relevant to the VoegelinMoldbug theory that the ideas we currently call left or liberal are not actually coming from a secularrationalistic basis but from a kind of religious basis a secularized form of gnosticism or hyperprotestantism or puritanism. There is something about the typical ethical vegan one would describe as holy or priestly. It is not something that can be derived ultimately from the scientific revolution Galilei and atheism you know? If liberalism or leftism was truly secular and skeptical in the origin it would contain a whole lot less dogoodery especially of the conspicious kind  And conservatives with their strongly masculine dominancebased attitudes group loyalty hierarchy etc. Social Dominance Orientation if you will remind one of warrioraristocrats.

10586355,0,t3_5riwfu,I definitely think the factual approach is unserious and that the late night talk show people are horrible. Did anyone notice all the TV personalities just become unbearable over the past year? I think a lot of the tone carried over from thinking Trump was a joke candidate you could just make fun of. I think the talk about Nazis and fascists is also related to this. This is because the use of those words and insistence on those words hides what is new about the present political configuration and movement we are dealing with. Compare to the constant reference to Islamofascism. Another complication is that we cant rely on a common understanding of fascism. So to refer to fascism we are relying on the cultural resonance of the fact that fascists and Nazis are bad and why they are bad. In so doing we are relying on the perception of the normal government as nonfascist not like the Nazis at all not authoritarian etc. Part of it is obviously that people like to circlejerk over their own opinions and form relationships which allow them to feel secure in their view that they are good or at least decent while others are bad indecent obscene. I think its notable that there is also the matter of material stability while there is not a super high bar to communicating online there is still a bar and many internet users are used to simply communicating with impunity. But if shit ever went down I bet a lot of people would just not know at all what to do myself included rofl and its really funny to think about in the context of us all being so pissed and tough on the internet.What will inevitably happen is that the situation will come to a head. The situation is also ontologically always coming to a head  becoming etc. but this creep of politics into everything will only continue the way Tiqqun talks about civil war cutting through all groupings in society diving families neighborhoods nations etc. When that happens there will simply be a determination things will play out a certain way and the consequences could be irreversible nuclear warmartial lawetc.. The only thing to do is to hone ones own sense of radical responsibility for history and to try and build relationships based on this sort of understanding. Concerted effort gesturing toward the common good is immensely powerful. I think that a positive project can only be invented and understood as it is being created and that we need to take advantage of our ability to do good work. My personal opinion is that we must proudly proclaim an aspiration to internationalismtransnationalism something like that globalism is obviously connotatively laden. The problem is the emulation of imperialism in the imposition of a single value system but I think the understanding must be that we must speak on the level of our real project in order to hone it and make progress. The goal would be not to make everyone agree with you and do what you and your group wants but to create a forum where people can levy their arguments. The political angle is in the conditions of possiblity of existence for political debate. Not just to rally to restore sanity but to seek to create a way to be sane in arguing for reasonable responses to the worlds challenges. I dont think that anyone in particular needs to talk to Nazis or come up with arguments for every stupid thing people say. What I am saying is that some leftists must understand the necessity of having something to say when the chips are down and the cameras are rollings words that can call into existence new possibilities make the seemingly impossible possible. TLDR if there is a problem with Leftist discourse lets get out there and be the best damned discoursers we can be. ,CriticalTheory,dd7wgfe,3,t5_2tmcb

10744116,0,t3_5tnsvp,I see what you are saying but information should be free. Living in the information age has accelerated and ballooned politics into giant spectacle but that does not mean you cant be an advocate for something. And you are right part of critical theory is taking things that are widely assumed to be true and putting them under a magnifying glass to see if they should indeed be held true. I think what you really mean is you should be open to all discourse. That is truly thinking critically. Someone who is not willing to listen or engage in a conversation due to a preconceived selfidentity is probably a somewhat deluded person. ,CriticalTheory,ddo6a2q,2,t5_2tmcb

10936763,0,t1_de805hl,So what exactly isare the unifying essences of this postmodern ideology ? Im curious as to why youre so insistent in the belief that postmodernism is some codified ideological stance instead of understanding that its an incredibly abstract term . ,CriticalTheory,de81tsd,2,t5_2tmcb
10937845,0,t1_de8428t,yes nice points thanks for contributing them. I do think it is conceivable that AI can eventually become autonomous to the point of having something comparable to a speciesessence.

11059961,0,t3_5xwj02,Wouldnt it make more sense to go from consumption to cannibalism as a type of consumption? I would suggest revising or clarifying your post if youre not interested in the literal consumption of human flesh by humans.If however thats what you are going for then I second ufabiolanzoni and would also add Eduardo Viveiros de Castros work especially Cannibal Metaphysics.Edit to clarify a bit to me going from cannibalism to other consumption is like putting the cart before the horse. Or maybe the oak before the acorn would be a better analogy.,CriticalTheory,delmn3y,3,t5_2tmcb

11573340,0,t1_dg5sp78,Theres something about the default personshumansfamilies etc. that he has in mind when he surveys the world in his worldsurveying thing that he does. Its very default. There is always some truth to it but the way it presupposes people and the totalized versions of their truth is somehow stultifying and somehow inherently wrong sort of like a good version of a Hitler or some other dictator who presumes so much about every person the average person etc. I find it far better to talk about the phenomenon in question than attach it to whole people better to take people as in a way participating in this than simply to sketch out the whole narrative of who they are. I sometimes call this person holism something I strongly dislike. True the trends can take place but there are all sorts of other moments in those very people that are not evidence of the given operation he is criticizing. Im not sure why this is so important to me or why I have such a strong reaction against it but Ill tell you this even in thinking more directly about it its making me rather upset. I think its horrific. And bear in mind that Im all for the critical perspective whatever phenomenon you want to name but start attaching it to people in too simplistic a way and I think its not just mistaken its bad in some very serious ways. Very problematic. Part of the very problem to the point that the Adorn class of people themselves should be regarded in an Adornoesque lense and cast as person wholes class wholes who all evince the sociopoliticalintellectualHegelianetc. class they are cast in within this sensibility at least until our Adorno sees how he likes it.,CriticalTheory,dg7uedw,4,t5_2tmcb
