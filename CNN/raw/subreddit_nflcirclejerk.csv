Heck for most games they have a high school band come in and do a half time show or something instead of watching cheerleaders dance.....I think it is much more beneficial to the community than to have a bunch of women whos only point is to shake their ass and look pretty. It isnt high school basketball where they lead the crowd in cheers its an NFL football game,nflcirclejerk,cyrkmwn,2,t5_2sulf
