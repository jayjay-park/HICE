She was inspired by how they much they try to do for others even though they have a shoestring budget. Please check them out at  ,redditdonate,copvhj7,1,t5_2ukvv

3165830,0,t3_2wc38a,I wholeheartedly agree with this charity. I was shocked at how little revenue they had compared to the WWP. Not many people think about the issues that come up that the families of the soldier have to deal with hospitals doctors rehab etc.  To be able to give the family some RampR during very stressful times is a fantastic thing and is worth more to the family than many people would imagine. Hell my wife and I look forward to going to the grocery store to get away from the kids for an hour! It should come as no surprise that a large organization like the WWP would have a large revenue stream and indeed they do. Over M in . In stark comparison the WWFS stream was just over M. I scrolled through the two charity expenses and fundraising percentages and saw that Colonel John D. Folsom II USMCR WWFS was salaried at  annually while the CEO of WWP Mr. Steven Nardizzi Esq received a salary of . I thought to myself Wow Im in the wrong line of work. I wonder what really justifies a salary that high for a charity organization? I then read the bios of both parties Im writing about and the answer to my question became a bit clearer.Im not going to mince words but Mr. Nardizzi Esq. is a lawyer. And this might be a springboard for him to go into politics... but who am I to judge? Oh that might be a good career move!There was a time not too long ago that I was in need of employment and I sought help from to name a few Goodwill The United Way Dept. Of Labor and the VA. You know how many of those agencies helped me get employment so I could feed my family and keep the lights on? Not a damn one. All of those agencies had received money from me in one way or another and when I needed help they failed me amp my family.Needless to say Ive made up my mind which charity I am going to cast my vote for and have changed the recipient charity that gets a portion of my eBay sales proceeds. And it wont take a law degree to figure out which one I chose.Sorry for poor quality on both videos but heres one of Col. Folsom saying that he doesnt need someone to be a spokesperson for him  The same Mustang in the first video is auctioned off at BarrettJackson twice!,redditdonate,coq4y3x,3,t5_2ukvv
3167730,0,t1_coqb4kj,Im not taking sides man. I just offered you a possible answer to a question you had trying to put forward an argument against NPR in case someone who actually was against it didnt show up. Be thankful.gtHowever based on your reasoning all I would have to say isMany people say that NPR has a conservative bias and is even more right of center than Rush Limbaugh.Fine say that. Im not stopping you and I sure wont argue for or against that point.,redditdonate,coqc0v1,-2,t5_2ukvv

3176494,0,t1_cor6d7c,CharityWater has two pools of donors. General donations from the public go  towards projects. These projects are sometimes  Charity Water other times they help fund an already established operation in the region. When you make a donation they can tell you exactly where your funds went and where it made a difference. Meanwhile they have another pool of investors which fund infrastructureoperations. As for their website its all in house. Theyre big on the tech since they track the productivity of their wells and are in constant communication with their field teams and then they tie it all in.  Example when they bought a pair of well digging rigssupport vehicles a few years back.  They had GPS trackers on the rigs and they also had trackers on the wells as they went up or down to monitor output. Youre entitled to your opinions but please get your facts right. ,redditdonate,cor8qr9,2,t5_2ukvv

3183911,0,t1_coq1b85,gt No because they provide a good public service that I would think the majority of people want.Is that why their viewship is nowhere close to a majority and theyre not the top rated shows. Those actually belong to conservatives.They dont provide a good public service. They provide a mouth piece for the government and for liberals. Its as simple as that. ,redditdonate,cos0g7d,-1,t5_2ukvv
