4437642,0,t3_3bv3rv,Hey everyone as ubstamour pointed out I fell into the trap of nottestingwellenough. I used Hello World when I tested my codez which allowed my strupper function to DECEIVE me. In retrospect this should have been quite obvious given the nature of postfix incrementing. Anyway its fixed now sadly no longer  or  lines which makes it like at least x as uncool.Hey OP nice cdez you got going on there school assignment?. Im bored at work so I decided to change some of it to make it more compact. I think with these simple functions it makes it more readable but you do need to know a bit about pointers and such.. Some people will disagree with my suggestions which is fine Im not saying this is the best way to write this stuff its just a different way.  Your str upper function can be written as such     void strupperchar str            while str             str  str gt a ampamp str lt z ? str     str            str            A couple of choices were made here...  You were using a variable to index the string this isnt really needed. stri is the same thing as str  i since the while loop will terminate on  we can use str to loop through a whole string incrementing the pointer as the last thing in the block. Keep in mind you must have  at the end..isnt C crazy?  I compacted your if stuff down to a ternary statement basically if the condition is true it will return the left side of  otherwise the right side. In this case Im comparing with a and z instead of decimal or hex values because its a bit easier to read. I used str    because the space character is dec  or hex  you were using dec . If the value is not a lower case letter uppercase or other just keep it the same.  Your strcpy function. Mine is     void mstrcpychar dest const char src            do             dest  src         while dest src     I marked the source string as const because we arent modifying it.  The dowhile loop might not behave nicely with bad pointers havent tried it but for this it shouldnt matter too much. You could add a simple check at the top to avoid null stuff..just be aware that it might be a problem.  The dowhile loop itself is super simple..assign the value at dest to the value at src the while part will keep going and increment dest and src until src is . This part is a bit weird because were exploiting the infrequently used comma operator..the dest part will be executed and have its result discarded then src will be executed and have its result returned this acts as the test for the while loop. The comma operator will execute a series of things but only return the result of the last one.  Your delete newline function. Mine is     void delnlchar str            while str             str  str  n ?    str            str             Youre loop only goes to . Pretty restrictive much easier to do the test for  on str.  I chose to replace the newline character with a space if we replace it with  this will mess up probably every single other string function down the line. Replacing with  is a pretty terrible idea. If I have HellonThere!n and call delnl replacing with  on it and then try to print the string it will only print Hello. If you really want to pull your hair out replace newlines with  write the raw bytes to a file and then try getting back your full text..P Thats all Im gonna talk about for now..thanks for distracting me for a bit lol. Hopefully this isnt very unreadable honestly for C this is far from ugly IMO.,unixporn,csq1t1c,14,t5_2sx2i

6313183,0,t3_4232wf,First there are no default keybinds in bspwm. There are recommended ones and you can use them but really theyre just examples of what you can do not how you should set it up yourself. That being said in your sxhkd config you can just swap all instances super with alt and it should get you where you want. If not you can try remapping the keys on your keyboard. Just make sure if you go that route to listen to rebindings or else it wont respect it. As with your vim colorscheme your telling gruvbox to use your terminal colors with the first line you posted. Unless you have your terminal colors set to the soft variant it wont work.Hope that helps. Happy hacking!,unixporn,cz78lt2,1,t5_2sx2i

I am asking for programs that provide a rudimentary GUI over VT or some similar protocol although there arent many specifically programs that would help people replace their ordinary GUI workflow with a console only.Sure your list would be useful for a BashZsh genius but not for most people who come from a GUI world so they would probably prefer to use something like Midnight Commander.Most people who post questions about how to use TUI only on UNIX meaning VT only would find your list overwhelming not helpful.Also your list isnt on the Wiki of this sub which is what I was suggesting.And by the way I use MPlayer to play all my music and it does use the VT protocol to display play time and to read play commands from the user.,unixporn,czb5vi5,0,t5_2sx2i

Ive had a lot of trouble finding a theme that provided a dark background all throughout the GUI most of the time its dark in some areas but light in others. I think I finally found what I was looking for here and I also found a nice icon theme and I finally found an OSXesque metacity theme for the buttons!OS AntergosGTK Theme OSX Arc ShadowIcon Theme MasallaFont Ubuntu Mono EDIT Forgot a couple details. I have a top panel with just the clock which I think looks nice and clean and is always displayed. I have  other XFCE panels on the left is a dock panel with Whiskermenu and a few launcher icons that hides when it gets overlapped but shows if I move my mouse over it. The bottom middle panel displays my open windows and also hides intelligently on the left of that is a panel with my notifications and to the right of the middle panel is some miscellaneous buttons like show desktop screenshot my virtual workspaces and a couple others.

Perhaps i gaining popularity within the ricing community in particular had to do with my direct involvement in i development for the past two years. Who knows. Personally I think thats a big factor but its not like I can prove it.gt because its an android theme and most people in randroidthemes are looking for android themesYeah thats true. But somebody at randroidthemes likely already is interested in Android no? So somebody seeing it on unixporn may go man never really thought about it  I should check it out Also to be fair I generally agree with the notion that if a specific sub exists perhaps it should be preferred. To be honest I couldnt write down a generic rule that describes my personal view of when it is or isnt okay to post in the more general sub. But in the specific instance of this submission my feeling says yeah its totally fine here.But that also has much to do with the fact that initially this submission was down and the complaint comments upvoted which absolutely amazed me not the good kind of amazement considering the frequent outbreaks of this sub is becoming boring and generic.,unixporn,d97g5km,1,t5_2sx2i

I use KDE on my old Laptop with an intel HD  GPU and KDE runs way smoother then on my computer NVidia GTX GPU. Unity instead runs fine if I install the NVIDIA drivers.

It works great everything works battery life is good I havent fiddled with touch screen but it worked freshly out of the box on install but since modifying that install I mightve broken it and I dont really care enough to fix it.Id say you should use something other than XFCE if you get the HiDPI screen Ive been looking to go with KDE when they get the global menu working properly on . and it matures a bit.Im sure using Compizreloaded instead of standard compiz would make it better and making my own GTK themes would be better since its hard to find one that makes the global menu look good.

The Suckless projects encompass a window manager terminal emulator vilike editor screen locker IRC client and a portable staticallylinked Linux distribution featuring a complete rewrite of the core Unix utilities from scratch among other things. I havent been on the mailing lists for some time but last I checked in there were about ten or twelve people who wrote in regularly. Anybody who had a patch to contribute to a project or wanted to discuss how to accomplish certain things by hacking the code was always welcome to write in. The elitist thing is tongueincheek they want to spend their time doing things that interest them and  they just dont have the energy to or interest in answering the same nb questions every other day.
