17113,0,t1_ceegq6f,I just wanted to throw this in thereI work with kids on the spectrum for a living as well as diagnosing them. Please recognize that the risk for girls is almost equivalent to boys due to girls more likely getting an incorrect diagnosis of ADHD since girls are more naturalistically empathetic.Having children less than two yrs apart is what increases the risk of having another child with autism and since your son is  it is much less likely. Folic acid and vitamin D supplements are a great way to decrease the odds of autism. I wish you and your family the best and if you have any questions re autism please feel free to PM me ,infertility,cegdraf,1,t5_2saej

I was always a lot more happy and outgoing after the last two and a half years I too struggle with depression. I think all of us women do. I havent made the decision to speak with anyone about it yet but I may in time. Some women on this forum do see therapists and it seems to really help.

599243,0,t3_2106c3,These are the most relevant hormones FSH boosts follicle growth. Low FSH is possible when suppressed by estrogen and is commonly found in PCOS. If this is the case you would have long andor irregular periods. You could have it tested early in the cycle for example day . High FSH indicates premature menopause and would also result in long irregular or completely absent cycles. LH triggers ovulation. Never heard about problems with this hormone specifically but it is possible to have anovulatory cycles. To diagnose that a progesterone test in the luteal phase second half of the cycle would be a good idea. Estrogen builds the endometrial lining. If you fear low estrogen ultrasound can be used to measure how the lining grows. High estrogen is possible in case of PCOS and the explanation for low FSH applies here. Progesterone keeps the endometrial lining intact. Low progesterone could result in a luteal phase defect which might cause you to lose pregnancies. This should be noticable because youd have a short lt  days luteal phase andor you got some positive pregnancy tests with a period that wasnt late by much afterwards. AMH can be measured to find premature ovarian failure. Alternatively or in addition an antral follicle count can be done.In addition there are some other issues such as hypothyroid or autoimmune diseases that cause cause early pregnancy loss.

670417,0,t3_21tzum,Here is a link discussing the difference between PGS and PGD. I found it to be helpful for us. We are doing PGS currently. They retrieved the eggs fertilized them with ICSI and then have them grow to DAY . One day  they will take a cell sample from the area that will become the placenta so it is not like they are taking cells that would later become babys brain cells or anything exciting. We have a history of recurrent pregnancy loss one confirmed trisomy and ectopics. We chose PGS with our docs advisement to help increase the chances of us having a healthy baby implanted. The cost is out of pocket. We are trying to get our insurance to cover it but it is still under review. It costs  in NY for PGS then an additional  for storage transferring using an outside clinic source etc. EDITOur insurance company Blue Cross of Illinois decided to not cover the PGS for us. They only will cover PGD thanks a lot blue cross X and Y carrier related disorders. We are appealing but its not looking good. So for those of you trying it may help if you clinic submit as PGD or PGDPGS instead of PGS alone. ,infertility,cggh4sh,1,t5_2saej

Even though we know rationally that thats not the truth centuries of this attitude have definitely left their mark. For me it was the right time because were at the IVF point and have an actual process to blog about versus just the emotional side. I spoke to a friend of mine who knows someone that blogged through IVF and at the end just told people that she was going to take a break from blogging until the knew the outcome.

881099,0,t1_ch4fe77,Yeah the procedure itself was HORRIBLE for me. I had the radiologist and two techs. I have a history of vasovagil responses fainting but it didnt happen this time. I kind of think it would be better if it had. When he injected the dye I couldnt see the screen. He turned it though to show me because I was already in so much pain he wanted to see if I could tolerate him trying it again to see if they would open.I also said fuck a few times. Luckily my husband came with me. I had a colposcopy two years ago and was not well after it so I thought it best to bring him to drive me home. The radiologist also really really sugar coated things There are SO MANY things they can do nowadays! No no there arent so many things when it comes to this. There are two roads both of which involve surgery Depending on the cause of the blockage and the severity of it they might be able to surgically open the tubes. If this is not an option then theres surgery to remove the tubes the damaged part of the tube can leak toxic fluid into the uterus and reduces success of IVF by  and its straight to IVF. Unless Ive completely missed the boat these are our options if we want to conceive. And it sucks balls.I fired last week. Im totally onboard if you decide this week is fired too.Your emotions are valid. It fucking sucks. But there are women in here who give me hope.

Its important to remember that all of these medications have different mechanisms of action.  So your reaction to one wont have any bearing on your reaction to a different one.  Also many of the IVF drugs are purified versions of hormones naturally created in the body whereas Clomid and Femera are not.  For instance the trigger shot used in IVF is hcg the same hormone created when you are pregnant.  Follistim is a purified version of FSH.

Its just the financial people that arent forthcoming and thats because this is an HMO and this funding info office is just beyond the member services part but member services may be the place to go to find out the limits of this  coverage not those folks if I want a straight and quick answer.  I checked w the frost desk nurse and she was like complain! they are the only people who dont do their job around here! totally not up to our standard of care! and Id have to agree with her.  My records etc. are all online I leave with a paper copy of directions with an email backup so Im not at a loss for information so far.  I have all the info for a second opinionconsulting another office and maybe I should start that if this IUI doesnt work to see what its like elsewhere.  Up until this point its been a nobrainer not just with the insurance coverage but using my HMO because the ability to get my records online and email and speak directly to my doctors and get a same day or next day response is better than the standard of care in general for medical stuff.Its def not a consultation in October Ive had  now and the person I spoke with would be in charge of scheduling another and my RE is available about a week and a half out.  I understand there are just a limited number of slots I just dont understand the relationship of slots to weeks.I agree I want to be supercomfortable if I am spending any money especially that much and with so much riding on it.

1290980,0,t3_28tfkc,I dont think theres any evidence that Clomid would be helpful in your situation unfortunately. And actually if the new SA comes back with similar amounts youre probably better off going straight to IVF sorry. I wish someone had told me that up front rather than having us waste money on Clomid and IUI cycles. With only  million sperm even if morphology improves your chances of success with IUI are pretty low lt per try assuming that you end up with lt million motile sperm after washing very likely with a starting total of only  million. Also I dont think morphology matters if they do ICSI a lot of clinics do so your chances of success with IVF are actually really good.The thing to keep in mind with SA results is that the normal numbers are actually the minimum needed to not be considered to have MFI theyre not the average. Theyre actually the bottom  of the population. So with a total count of  million your husband is only around  of the bottom  cutoff of  million. Average count is closer to  million so  million is quite low.We never did anything to try to increase my husbands SA results so I cant help you there. A urologist might be able to help but any lifestyle changes or surgical intervention will take  months or so to take effect so know that its a very slow process.,infertility,cieuo8w,2,t5_2saej

1325907,0,t3_299ngx,Unfortunately this is not enough information to determine whether natural conception or IUI would be feasible. If his count is high it could compensate for both issues. Also to get some idea it would be necessary to know exactly how low the volume is.From what Ive read low volume is quite different in terms of treatment than the more common types of MFI low count and low motility. This article lists some possibilities the language is quite technical feel free to ask if anything is unclear. The TLDR is that some common reasons such as retrograde ejaculation are treatable which could save you from having to do IVF. To know whether that is the case for you youll need to do more testing though.It is a common misconception that IUI is always cheaper. While a cycle of IUI is certainly much cheaper than a cycle of IVF a cycle of IVF has a higher success rate which means you need fewer cycles. Hence it is perfectly possible that you could get pregnant with IUI but IVF is still more costeffective. This depends on the exact semen parameters preferably after washing and whether there are any other issues. For example if you need injectables for IUI that could bring the price per cycle closer to that of IVF. If there are other infertility issues IVF may bypass them while IUI does not.Apologies for the vague answer but without more data it is hard to give good advice or from your side to make a decision.,infertility,ciis57u,4,t5_2saej

1510972,0,t3_2bilyd,Im sorry to hear about the results!  There are a TON of reasons for what causes different degrees of MFI but the good thing is that there are a number of tests that can be run to rule outdiagnose many of the most common that could at least give some explanation.  Also keep in mind that different SAs done over a period of time sometimes yield different results.  The smallest things can affect the numbers.  Unfortunately I dont have any experience with generally low numbers as my husbands SA yielded NO sperm so we were facing a whole different monster so Im not a ton of help but a surgery I do know that commonly negatively affects male fertility is an inguinal hernia repair.  Basically its a hernia that occurs in the groin region and since the tubes and everything are right around there sometimes they end up getting blocked or overcome by scar tissue.  I think the important thing to do in this situation in this moment is to just be completely supportive of your husband.  Make sure he understands you still love him and everything and that you two will work together to get through this.  My husband took his news hard but I know it helped when I stressed that we were in it together and I didnt blame him for one second.,infertility,cj5ocs1,3,t5_2saej

1630880,0,t3_2cz38b,Wow thank you for joining.  This group is one of the most educated and knowledgeable I have found regarding infertility so I am sure you will gain a lot hearing the stories of actual infertility couples and we certainly would love to have your professional insight.  Welcome!I am not nearly as versed and I am fairly new as my fellow members so my question may be more simplistic.  Our fertility issue appears to be male factor infertility.  My husband has only had one sperm analysis the next one will be in  weeks.  However is first numbers were pretty bad Concentration . ml motility  morph  Vol . ml and ph ..He had a hormonal panel and several blood test looking for infection and all has come back great.  Ive done some research and it seams like a varicocele might be the only thing that could explain all three major areas of decline all though neither of us are able to feel anything abnormal in his scrotum.  My concern is the research is extremely mixed on what steps to take for treatment either pro surgery or against surgery.  This is a hypothetical situation as of today but this may be a concern someone else so I wanted to ask with todays research can you explain the pros and cons for and against having a varicocele repair surgery when battling infertility? For my own personal story Im nearing  and my concern is doing a surgery that may produce no significant benefit to our goal having a baby. From what I can tell if my husband actually has this he has no pain or discomfort and wouldnt even know about it unless this happen.  Our sex life is not impaired by it and I have found no health risk to him if he does not get it repaired.  Any thoughts you have from an RE position and one in the mist of research would be greatly appreciated.  Is there a benefit or con I am missing?Thank you and welcome again. ,infertility,cjkqk81,1,t5_2saej

1650129,0,t3_2d89sl,Depends on your insurance and diagnosis but after  medicated IUI failures the odds go down dramatically and it makes sense to move on to IVF. I am still in the IUI phase though.

1651473,0,t3_2d9753,When I had my HSG it was painful and sucked but once I was done I was practically skipping home happy for it to be over. My husband was still shaking we had to buy him a drink to ease his nerves haha. I only do trigger shots so only have done two Ovitrelle one for each IUI so far. I inject myself so its no big deal. Maybe you can ask someone else to help you with the shots if he is just not up to the medical stuff? Some guys are just really horrible with needles blood and pain.As for the does he really want it? Honestly? Probably not as much as you want. At least thats the feeling I get from my own husband. Also the majority of people on this subreddit is female even though infertility hits both in a marriage. And even though as far as I know the majority of Reddit is male. Yet it is us the woman openly being vocal about our wishes. Now dont get me wrong I also know guys who really desperately want to become fathers or have been lucky to already have become a dad.For us I know my husband would be able to have a perfectly happy life without children. He feels responsible for taking care of the children financially he is worried they wont be healthy he is worried about not being a good parent I work with kids so I am far more experienced and relaxed around them... he worries about things he cant control. Very pragmatic. We quite often have to talk about the fun things kids can and will bring. He needs that reassurance. Just as I sometimes need reassurance about other things. Yes he does things to make me happy... but I also do things to make him happy. In the end we do things together.Infertility puts a hell of a lot of pressure on a relationship. Keep talking to each other. Its not an easy road youre on but youre traveling it together. Take care and feel free to PM me whenever you want hug,infertility,cjnbybl,1,t5_2saej

An RE will take into account the fact that it took  years to conceive the first time  and that you have a history of cysts.

We ended up doing a natural IUI that month it was our rest month before IVF and figured why not. I dont know how you will respond given that you have PCOS.

The polyps are generally small and are pretty soft so theyre pretty easy to remove.  I had mine out on a Friday and took it easy over the weekend.  It was really no big deal and I just took Advil for the pain.  The most annoying part was minor bleeding for maybe  weeks.  I tried an IUI the very next cycle so the recovery is very minimal.  I have to have another one actually before I transfer any embryos that may be available from my upcoming IVF.Could be he will find out its a fibroid.  The surgery for those can be much more involved depending how large they are but still not the end of the world. Good luck!

So now she is supposedly talking to my current treatment team meaning the horrible nurse who has contradicted herself every time my husband or I have talked with her so I dont have any faith that this is going to get much better from here.Once my blood pressure goes down and I have heard back from people I am going to post a complete synopsis of this shitshow and name the clinic.

2126379,0,t1_cl9q74f,Your venting is so so well deserved. I am so sorry things are so shitty right now. It truly seems that when it rains it pours. On the dog issue which can be SO STRESSFUL in itself! My parents dachshund isnt the best with cats. They can be fairly pray driven initially bred to hunt badgers I believe. Thats not to say they cant acclimate friends of ours have  dachshunds and a whole buncha cats it helps that the cats can get into areas the dog cant. Can you maybe gate off some rooms that the cat can jump over but the dog cant get into? Maybe that would help calm the cats and dog down?That being said Im a big advocate in the pets are adopted for life mantra BUT when you adopt an animal and it doesnt get along with your current pets that IMO is a perfectly acceptable reason to give the dog back.  I get the feelings of guilt. And I think rescues feed those feelings sometimes by not understanding or accepting that there can be major deal breaking issues that only manifest when the dog gets into a home. If you do decide to give him back please dont feel bad. This is a good reason its legit you have to take care of the pets you already have too.  ,infertility,cla3xur,1,t5_2saej

2232284,0,t3_2kpiza,Hi and welcome!  I am also  and currently on my third IVF cycle  miscarriage plus failures and even tho I do know the benefits of pgs we opted to not do it this time around.  One thing to note PGS is not covered by any insurance so it a completely out of pocket cost.  Generally you will also freeze all of your normal embryos and depending on the lab they may or may not work with your insurance to pay for the actual freezing.   So you are looking at a fresh cycle cost plus meds  biopsypgsfreeze  FET cycle costs and meds.  All labs charge a different amount unfortunately for us the lab my RE uses pgs starts at   embryos and if I wanted to batch my embryos two or more fresh cycles in a row so I can have as many embryos tested at once it would be a minimum of .  Even with insurance we just couldnt do it.  This lab is very expensive tho and I know there are less expensive options out there.  I will say this if this cycle fails we will be doing pgs for my th and final Ivf.,infertility,clnkrm5,2,t5_2saej

It really depends I think on the individual and if you exhibit additional auto immune things...  They didnt think I had lupus because I didnt have the classic signs like the mylar rash.  But no one ever considered further testing for things like lupus or other auto immune issues with a positive ANA because they thought that the hashimotos triggered the ANA levels.Autoimmune issues are so difficult to diagnose because usually it takes a massive issue for it to even be looked at.

This Christmas was the cutoff so to speak and here I am staring down the barrel of what to me feels like total failure.

At the end of last week I felt a bit of a bulge near my bottom front teeth and on Saturday when I was pushing my tongue against it it decided that its totally okay to ooze pus in my mouth. GROSS. Called the weekenddentist he said it could wait till Monday. Called my regular dentist this morning and they wanted to see me right away. Xrayed my lower jaw and lo and behold massive infection inflammation?. Abscess. Good thing is that it now has a way out. Also a good thing is that is has zero to do with my teeth it just happens to be near them but theyre not the cause. Bad thing is that he cant do anything about it. I told him about Lupron... on the leaflet it says that abscesses filled with pus are a common side effect for children and an unknown side effect in adults. Called the special Lupronpharmacy theyll add it to their databank just in case. The pharmacist asked if I will be taking my thirdlast shot of Lupron this Wednesday.. erh I guess so? She advised me to call a doc about it. Too late now will call tomorrow. It would feel a bit shitty to have to cancel a whole month of a three month Lucrin treatment... but yeah I really dont want this thing to get worse ick.So holy shit the things you get to deal with when trying to have a kid sigh.

In my case I have positive antibodies but to actually have a dx for Antiphospholipid Syndrome you have to have either had a blood clot event or  miscarriages.  And since I cant really get pregnant naturally the only other event would be a blood clot which Ive never had.  But that said if youre positive theyll put you on a blood thinner to prevent issues in pregnancy.  Still good to know  cause blood clots are scary!As for recommendations of how many to transfer?

2725981,0,t3_2r7xvy,So my round of IVF with ICSI a fresh transfer and all meds was k right here in the USA. Is it really worth the cost of flights and staying in a country where the cost of food and whatnot is significantly higher? Ive been to Copenhagen youre going to pay about  more for food. Plus the treatment will take a while can you take off of work for  weeks? What if your fresh transfer fails and you do a FET will you fly home and back between the treatments? My doctor required me to have a full month off between my fresh failure and starting my FET meds. Not to mention I had to be there within a couple of days of my cycle starting so I hope youll have an open ticket if you end up going home. If all youre going to save is k you can shop around and find a better deal than k is it worth it if youre not a Danish citizen? If you were telling me you were going to Eastern Europe and getting treated for k including meds thatd be sensible. But if the difference is really k vs k again this was my cost in a major US city and I have ZERO covered by insurance ZERO not one fucking penny I just dont think its worth it. Besides do you know all of their rules regarding transfers? If youre older you might want to consider transferring more than one embryo at at time but their laws might not permit it.

2757673,0,t3_2rm08l,I have an abnormal uterus  its ridiculously named a unicornuate uterus. It took several years for the diagnosis though some details emerged early on via an HSG and a D ultrasound. I eventually got the realdeal story after getting a laparascopy performed by a specialist. My recommendation is that you see a specialist or more than one to get confirmation of the diagnosis and see what options are available. Some uterine abnormalities will have more of an impact than others. With my particular version for example it is impacts fertility in two ways only one of my ovaries is connected to my uterus so if I ovulate in the other one Im SOL and when I do get pregnant Im far more likely to miscarry and not likely to carry to term. That being said its my understanding that some uterine abnormalities can be helped a friend of my had a septate uterus and had a surgery to correct it.FWIW I would clarify your medical situation as soon as possible. I had an RE that was pushing me on IVF before I had my full diagnosis and Im glad now that I didnt pursue that without knowing my situation. It would have been quite a lot of money spent without really knowing the probability of the outcome. ,infertility,cnhjbme,2,t5_2saej

3209410,0,t1_coum9d7,Sack of shit yes.  Suggestion this worked for the SO and a friend go talk to HR.  Talk to them about the impact the stress that having two fulltime positions empty is causing for you AND for boss.  Ask for at least a fulltime temp and ask what the timeline to get at least one other person since it appears a really good candidate was lost recently.  You dont have to say anything like you are thinking of quitting to get stuff to happen just say its causing stress trying to keep up even when you leave work and its stressing your boss out unfairly and you are feeling it when he tries to accommodate your doctors appointments.  You can say you dont want the boss to know you went to them but that you and he are both in need of support.  Throw in a little if either of us took a mental health day the whole thing would implode for good measure if its true.  Both times this worked.  Took about  weeks to see change.  The third time SOs boss was the problem.  Crazy boss is gone now.  HR was horrified it was a shitstorm.  Thinking in your case boss has already tried hard and someone decided your dept isnt as important as something else but if HR hears otherwise from a good employee they might lose they might grease the wheels.

There are still tests I could do namely a laparoscopic surgery to check for endo which I dont have symptoms of a hysteroscopy to check for Ashermans small polyps or other inside of the uterus problems which I dont have symptoms of and an endometrial biopsy to check for lining receptivity which there are no symptoms to be had.  Right now we arent going that route unless my FET fails.Have you had your ovarian function tested?  CD estrodial AMH?  FSH?  Have you had your prolactin and thyroid checked?

So really theyre testing it at DPO which is approximately the peak of your progesterone levels postovulation.  By testing you at what was effectively DPO your corpus luteum didnt have enough of a chance to emit enough progesterone to effectively measure.  So . is kind of useless information to have other than the fact that it confirmed you ovulated.  The levels youre looking for   etc are measured at DPO.

Some of my friends have split up over little things or one big thing because they have been part of couples that turn away from one another when things get difficult. My husband amp I are lucky to be a pair that turn toward each other when we are faced with trials.  Sometimes it has downsides namely we become hermit like and dont see friends until we are out of the other end but in the  years we have been together we have made it through him almost dying twice once from cancer once from a clotting disorder that had him in ICU four over four months with dozens of surgeries losing his dad losing babies dealing with horible det medical obviously our ectopic last fall and other shit storms.  At the end we are stronger for making it through and we have a deep understanding of who we are as individuals and as a couple and we both put our relationship at a place of importance in our lives.

In this world there are so many couples and everyone wants their own child. But I think  couples are not able to achieve a pregnancy due to infertility problems. They have to try to have a child. They go to different clinics to reduce the infertility issue and also try some tips. Have you tried some treatment to have a child? I know the cost of infertility treatment is too much higher as a middle class family cant afford this. But you can try some natural tips to cure your problem and your partner should also try.Our destiny is not in our hands. Its already made by god but if we want something which is not in our faith then we should at least try to achieve it. Why to regret about that this thing I dont have....

Chronic seminal vesiculitis Chronic seminal vesiculitis is a common complication of chronic prostatitis. In the chronic course of disease seminal vesiculitis coexist and interact with chronic prostatitis. With time passes by chronic prostatitis and chronic seminal vesiculitis can obviously have influence on male sexual function. . Impotence Impotence is also one of the common complications of chronic prostatitis. . Infertility In infertility patients chronic prostatitis is an important factor. . Epididymitis Prostatitis can coexist with seminal vesiculitis. Both inflammations can invade epididymis and then induce chronic epididymitis. So if you are bothered by the antibiotics herbal medicine is a better choice like Diuretic and antiinflammatory pill. It works well to your disease and can not harm to your fertilty.

Maybe down the road well get to that point but for now I have to focus on the road ahead of me instead of trying to see whats on the horizon. IF is a war and youve got to make every move and every thought tactical. If youre too wrapped up trying to figure out whats coming up ten moves ahead you might miss an opportunity in the present. Its okay to mentally prepare yourself for the possibility but dont get bogged down by it. Not until you know exactly what youre looking at. So until your RE says the actual words IVF just breathe.

Im surprised you had a period with a level of .  It might be worth doing some research into hormonal levels during a cycle and what causes them so you have a grasp on what is going on in your body.  Have you ever used ovulation predictor strips or temp charting?  I really wonder what yours would look like.  In a normal temp chart a womans temperature jumps after ovulation climbs and then if she isnt pregnant falls before her period.  What causes the temp changes is progesterone.    ,infertility,cvf7l47,3,t5_2saej

5265763,0,t3_3n4jvs,My understanding is that miscarriages are overwhelmingly because of chromosomal issues not carrier issues which wouldnt apply. And your clinic  RE should be able to provide progesterone support or any other corrections needed by doing a medicated transfer cycle.

5268242,0,t3_3n4jvs,I think counting people out because of miscarriages or reproductive assistance is a little...meh. I want to be a gestational carrier when I am done with having my own children. I have had to do IVFFET to get my son and we are about to head into the FET process again. My problem isnt being pregnant  its getting pregnant. With that said any woman even the healthiest of women can have a miscarriage. Since this potential GS is already going to be on plenty of progesterone support before and after the transfer Id say to go with it. If she had easy pregnancies before this one that is what Id focus on more than if she miscarried especially if they were first trimester miscarriages. If they were later than that then Id second guess it. I think feeling comfortable with her is most important. She will be growing your baby and Ive heard some awful stories of bitchy surrogates who were very mean to their intended parents.Also if these embryos are from your first IVF run I see that you had OHSS and you were hospitalized I wouldnt count out any other IVF attempts. The first attempt is always a science project. They would be crazy careful the next attempt because of the OHSS before. Just my thoughts on the matter! ,infertility,cvl2ru7,3,t5_2saej

5477648,0,t3_3q1ce8,I can chime in we used a donor to have my daughter. We met our donor when she was in town for the donation and hit it off. We look nothing alike but have very similar personalities. Shes young uninterested in having children of her own for a few years yet. Were extremely close now sort of like shes my younger sister. I wont say that it hasnt complicated things but in general I love her and hope that if there is a genetic basis to generosity that my daughter has inherited some of our donors wonderfully generous genes. She feels no connection to my daughter Ive seen it first hand but feels close to me and my husband. Im sure some of that is that she was  when she donated to us. This setup definitely isnt for everyone but I have to say I have so much gratitude and love for her because of what she gave us. I too am scared that someday my kid or kids will tell me that Im not their real mom were planning on explaining early in ageappropriate ways. For now however my daughter cries for me is comforted by me and gives me the biggest hugs and smiles. Whatever happens I hope shell realize how much we went through to bring her into our family. The pain that comes from having a child where we dont share a genetic connection pales in comparison to the pain of infertility and waiting to start a family.

5926196,0,t1_cxwf9e8,Well Clomid and Femara act a little differently to produce the same result so some people do better on one vs the otherI did a bit better with Clomid other people have done better with Femara some people it makes no difference at all. But injectables are the next level up from Clomid and Femara. Your own body can only do so much so injectables can take you beyond that. If you want to take a more conservative approach try the Clomid first. Alternatively if you try the injectables and then if you overrespond you can always go backwards and try Clomid. It starts feeling like you are a walking science experiment doesnt it?Most of this comes down to FSH which is Follicle Stimulating Hormone so as a general rule of thumb more FSH more results. Theres some refinement beyond that but it gets fuzzier and varies more between REs and whatever your body does.  That said if you are a poor responder there comes a point where you can keep throwing FSH at it but its not going to make a differencewhats generally happening there is that your FSH receptors in your ovaries can only take so much so after they hit a point they cant listen anymore. Thats why some people after not doing well on stims dont necessarily get moved up to a higher doseit becomes more medication and more money for no more effect.,infertility,cxwgemi,1,t5_2saej

6069523,0,t3_3yo255,I personally skipped the IUIs altogether and moved right to IVF because the success rate for IVF was much higher and due to the number of years wed been trying gt the RE didnt think IUIs would be very successful. IVF was not nearly as scary as I had thought it would be... that being said it wasnt a walk in the park either. The shots werent bad but I had mild OHSS symptoms after my ER. Im the one who told you they all come out the same and they do. Nobody is going to look at your baby while youre at the park playing and whisper thats a science baby. As Squirrel mentioned below you can always do a compassionate transfer w your extra embryos if you have any or you can talk to your Dr. and do a natural IVF cycle where they dont really stim you. usonalogy could probably give you some info on that. ,infertility,cyf7c9w,1,t5_2saej
6069591,0,t3_3yo255,What would I do? I was given shitty odds for IVF by  REs and at the same time my cycles were getting so wacky that IUI or natural conception were increasingly impossible. Heres what I did Fuck the magical thinking. Stare down reality no matter how ugly. The longer you spend fighting with the reality of your fertility the less time you spend actually dealing with the situation. Get your CD numbers updatedFSH can vary wildly and  years is a long time in this game. One failed IUI means jack shit. Get an RE you feel comfortable talking to and talk through the oddsdepending on your numbers multiple IUIs may better use of your dollars than one IVF one IVF may be a better use of your time. Fuck other people. Ignore whatever the hell everyone else was doing. Fuck em all. Nearly every single person I know outside this sub who wants children has them whether through natural means IVF IUI adoption or donor eggs... I mean lapped? I was lapped before I entered the race. Nearly every single person on this sub who has done IVF responds better than I do. The day I got my recordhigh FSH number that inspired the Have you considered donor eggs? conversation virtually no one here had every been close to that number. Bitterness is understandable but not useful. That many other people have it better in some respects does not change the reality of my fertility.  Fuck fear. Instead of fear I think about regret.  years from now when I have no options am I going to look back and wish I had tried? If yes I continue. When I got the news about the shitty odds and subsequently had a new shitty surprise every cycle what kept me going was not hope that it might all work out because see point  fuck magical thinking but certainty that if it didnt work at least I would be able to look back and say Yes I did everything I reasonably could at the time. There are so many things along the way that are scary and anxiousmaking but fuck fear do them anyway. Trust the fuck out of yourself. This is more general than infertility. In life in IF in marriage shit will happen. Repeatedly. Often many different sorts of shit raining down all at once. There is no sense in avoiding things particularly the big important things because shit might happen. Shit will happen anyway. Instead trust yourself to deal with it when it comes. How much longer can you do this? What to do with extra embryos? What if it fails? When do you stop? What if it impacts your marriage? Trust that you will figure these things out as they come. Swearing. Its a motherfucking coping mechanism. ,infertility,cyf7nr6,24,t5_2saej

I dont starve myself I dont do any sort of diet with a name except for eating clean  eating real food things with fewer than  ingredients shopping from perimeter of store etc. I dont deny myself anything but try to keep sweetstreats in moderation.It worked the first time and Im hoping itll work this time too. I want to incorporate more weights this time around maybe about  times a week?I also go to the gym or run in the morning. I like to see the sunrise as a reward for getting up early. Then I can come home have my hot delicious morning coffee and get on with my day. It also helps to clear my head and get the urge to fidget out before the day even begins.

My clinic likes to have you wait a looong time before you can test. In the back of my mind I always feel like I need to wait it out otherwise I will second guess myself. But I get it. We already have to do so much waiting and when you want to get the show on the road for the next try it is really annoying to have to pause even more. ,infertility,czmc53k,2,t5_2saej

6601919,0,t1_d01cyhx,As someone in multiple groups for clotting disorders and who had a significant DVT and SVT why I delayed TTC and a contributor in why I came here  you bet that stuff is a factor. My RE doesnt believe in my clotting disorder but I met with a perinatologist who most certainly did.   Often its the MFMs who dont know enough and downplay the risk to someone who is newly pregnant and its the hematologist that straightens them out.  I also think they are all more conservative cautious in the UK maybe because the consequences of not caring enough are borne by the system they work for and not an individual. Factor V ought to be a no brainer but it is astonishing to me the number of docs who say MTHFR is no big deal especially if just one mutation or the slightly less common  and then you find out a person with no difficulty getting pregnant has had  miscarriages after a heartbeat is seen even RPL after  or  finds something that shouldnt matter and some MFM finally says well lovenox cant hurt I suppose given your history and one finally sticks.   The point is a whole bunch of doctors decided that their tolerance for risk in this scenario was very high.   The patient on the other hand has suffered a series of losses and heartbreak.   Since awareness of my APS  years ago I am not just in APS groups I have just seen this pattern so many times that I believe a lack of sufficientgood quality research to show it does actually matter is more likely problem.   What we work with now is an attitude that because there isnt overwhelming research evidence it does matter because a bunch of those people who are treating it are busy with patients and dont see enoughenough in a short period to do quantitative research and publish they just see enough heartbroken folks and fix it and move on to the monitoring needed at the end of pregnancy too many dismiss it.   As much as I think about these things because of my own experience more OBs and perinatologists and MFMs are caring for patients for other reasons than clotting disorders so it could take some experience over time to get them to believe.   My perinatologist consult between my th and th IUI came with a doc on call for LampD in the ER who it turns out went to school with my RE who doesnt believe in APS which she says they totally learned in school and since then her experience has taught her other things but thats super annoying to hear as a patient.  If the medical community has such capacity for risk with the general population TTCing the old fashioned way and failing repeatedly those who have to work harder for every attempt at conception who work with a doc who doesnt believe it matters are getting an even shorter end of the stick and paying through the nose for it in this country.  One miscarriage was enough for me and it was pretty important for me to hear we could rule out my clotting disorder as the reason in that case when picking myself up off the floor to keep trying. Lovenox isnt going to protect everyone from everything lots of late pregnancy issues with cords there is no prevention for but if your training was that most clotting stuff doesnt impact early pregnancy take another look. And I am sorry your IVFs have failed.   Picking yourself up to go on and even go on to do it again is so hard. ,infertility,d026ybf,1,t5_2saej

Many also conceive through much higher levels of interventions. Others never do for reasons that are often a combination of physical financial and emotional.All Im saying is that if you here bad news it will suck but it does not mean there is no hope for you.

6897528,0,t3_4a6xs5,I wish I had solid gold advice here that would allow you to get some space from this. But I dont. What I can tell you is that much like others will say some time will help this grief ease. Lots of us still have a decent amount of stress over seeing pregnant ladies and babies. I do ok with babies in general most of the time but I have a really hard time with women who are pregnant. Its something that I may never experience we will likely not adopt but we could and that would allow us the baby experience so babies are easier. My husband cant handle the babies but isnt bothered by pregnant ladies as much. So there it is...dealing differently with the loss of our dream of a family. I still occasionally use OPKs and we still try to hit the window just in case something miraculously happens. But I dont worry about what I eat or drink or how hard I workout in the TWW because the chances of me getting knocked up are so slim that its more emotionally draining for me to worry about it.So this will eventually get easier. In the meantime despite your and your husbands different opinions on moving forward cling to each other if you can.

I told my husband that if he wasnt  on board within a year that I would freeze my eggs so we had the option later and thus negate my worry of regretting not doing it now. That is when he stated that I was forcing his hand and it made him feel like I was saying Im doing this with or without you! So I had to back peddle and agree not to freeze my eggs without his consent and at that point he would be consenting to IVF not freezing eggs.You are so right with talking to the dr. Ive done that and I thought it was very clear that it was IVF or nothing. Like they wont even let me throw my money down the toilet because the risk of an ectopic pregnancy is so high if any pregnancy actually resulted. Part of me is like its way more invasive for me than you so if Im ok with it whats the deal? I suppose instead I should be happy that he doesnt want me to undergo  Pain and  Anesthesia.As for the money thing I think its more that he doesnt want to be in debt to MY parents we dont get along with them particularly well. But I seriously dont think my mother would hold it over us anyway. And since he turned down my parents first he doesnt want to say yes to his parents.  ,infertility,d13n7nj,1,t5_2saej

7416595,0,t3_4gvhek,My parents went through infertility treatments themselves for about ten years and my mom told me watching me go through it was ten times worse than going through it herself since there was nothing she could do to fix it for me. Ive never seen her really cry other than when I told herto be fair i was sobbing since I had just found out my cousin was pregnant after  month of trying. I remember my Dad just put his face in his hands for a couple minutes.I have no idea how to support her and try and help. Shes got an extremely healthy outlook on it  she says she had kids so she could help them achieve whatever their dreams were and that none of us owed her anything as far as grandchildren go.

Example If you did IVF and transferred  blastocysts and none of them took you achieved the same outcome through trial and error. You would still be emptyhanded even if you had added PGS. In this scenario it may have almost paid for itself by saving you FET monitoring FET meds and more possible MC if some or all came back abnormal.I think REs are overselling it as your path to a baby and quote absurdly high success rates.

7746884,0,t3_4ldlbf,I agree with every comment written here.  The priority here is you.  If you genuinely feel ok with discussing her pregnancy then go for it but if you dont then you shouldnt.  I have a couple of friends pregnant just now and have no problem whatsoever with a couple of them I happily ask how things are going and they are great at sharing but equally great at having loads of other things to talk about interacting in my life as well as expecting me to want to know about theirs.  I actually love having pregnancy chats its not something that has ever upset me what upsets me is when friends do no behave like friends.One of my closest friends was quite thoughtless in relation to trying to conceive calling me  wks after my miscarriage following  cycles of ICSI to complain that  months after removing the coil in she was still not pregnant very long selfindulgent thoughtless conversation  weeks later sending a group text message on christmas day announcing her pregnancy then the following week when we spoke saying although things were early she felt like shit so everything must be ok mustnt it?!  I took a huge step back  not because she was pregnant but because I was repeatedly hurting from speaking to her  and when a month later she asked why by text and I told her she didnt contact me for  weeks.  When we met up she told me she believed my text to be a personal attack that she was sorry my miscarriage had made me this way and suggested I would have been happy if shed miscarried too.  My only advice is to be honest mainly to yourself and if you cant handle it then you need to tell her.  Maybe try and figure out a way to have just enough contact.  Or dont simply ask have a conversation  when you get in touch start with Hope everythings great with you hows it all going then tell her whats been happening with you your ups and downs successes and failures...

Well  my treatments work. I also have a holistic approach to treatment. I have a yoga certification personal training certification have studied over  scientific publications on varicocele and varicocele surgery have tested out pretty much every single natural treatment method for varicocele that exists... I have discussed treatment results with as many of my clients as I could and have improved and optimized the treatments over time. I know more about varicocele than nearly all of our doctors and thats a fact because most doctors know very little about varicocele.The most important thing is that it works. Thats all. Is it wrong to discuss alternative options to varicocele surgery? What if there was a riskfree way to get the same results? Why would you have to surgically cut out or block off the veins? What if they didnt have to be swollen? What if your lifestyle factors play a critical role in the severity and development of your varicocele?,infertility,d3pc4eq,-8,t5_2saej

For me I had a  on my first blood test and  on the second enough hcg that I got a positive on the home test not enough to bestay pregnant called a chemical pregnancy. Some home tests pick up I think as small as  hcg I forget the actual measurement unit. So the doc may call it a negative blood test but there was enough for the home test to pick it up.

7858725,0,t3_4mxunp,Im so glad youve finally gotten the medical care you needed. It really is terrifying that it takes on average  years for a woman to be diagnosed with endometriosis. Women in pain are ignored and women troubles are given even less attention.I had issues since I was a teenager and the response was alway yeah cramps stink apparently its fine if you vomit and have out of body experiences because of the pain. I started having bladder symptoms and the doctors were like well you dont have a UTI so youre fine. Then the bowel symptoms started you need to drink more water and eat more fiber and no one believed me when I said I was not constipated. The symptoms drove me crazy and seriously lessened my ability to function. Imagine having UTI symptoms for half a month every month and no doctor seems to care because they dont know what it is and assume youre crazy. I was diagnosed in my late s probably  years after symptoms started. Once because I was in worse pain than the appendicitis I had the year before I went to the emergency roomI was in the middle of my cycle.  When they gave me the diagnosis because of the endometriomas I had on my ovaries they said umm usually people dont come in here for this. As if I was being a baby. My OBGYN later said the cysts were probably leaking. This happened several more times because I was convinced by said obgyn not to have surgery unless the pain got really bad. Apparently having to take several percocet which doesnt always work because you feel worse pain than appendicitis and losing control of your bowels and vomiting everywhere because youre in shock is not really bad.When I finally had the surgery it was a godsend and I loved my surgeon if anyone is in the nyc area i would gladly share the surgeons info. But I also lost years into infertility because I hadnt gotten the surgery earlier. What do we do? How can we draw attention to this issue and have it recognized as the disabling condition that it is? And this is not just for endometriosis but infertility in general. Im angry too for myself and for everyone that has a similar story. Years lost because professionals are not taking women in pain and distress seriously.,infertility,d3ze3qp,6,t5_2saej

Im worried about that myself. This is how my brain works First Positive Pregnancy test! But lets wait and see if the levels rise normally.Second Levels are normal? Lets wait until the ultrasound to make sure it isnt ectopic blighted ovum etcThird Confirmed it is normal so far? Well we arent  sure that everything is viable because we havent had any testing done.Fourth Hit twelve weeks receive normalnonlife threatening results?

We basically just call out sick when were sick and dont get counted against for it. Unless someone starts abusing that. So I could theoretically use a sick day but those are for days when you cant show up to work unexpectedly and screws with my work load. If I know in advance I can take a vacation day which keeps my calendar clear that day.Im not explaining this well. Short answer is that we dont really have medical leave for single days we do have sick days but using those for something I know about in advance is iffy and can lead to more problems so vacation days are really my best option.,infertility,d4cut9g,1,t5_2saej

Your body uses so much of your fluid to flush the stim meds through your system that you get really backed up.

8325325,0,t3_4thz2k,I have an amh of . and fsh .. I did an antagonist protocol my first IVF although more menopur than you and got  eggs from  follicles.  were mature  fertilized. I had one put in at day  ended in mc and the other  didnt make it to day . As someone else said I think thats important to discuss with your RE the possibility of none making it to day blast. I dont think we could do PGS because we have so few embryos and they arent making it to freezing. It may turn out better for this IVF im doing a more aggressive protocol this time but we will still likely do a day . However since Ive only had one mc they would have different concerns for you. This is not to make you nervous just so you can discuss this with your RE. I gave up alcohol amp caffeine and took CoQ. Id say it didnt make a huge difference although it was reasonably successful in the eyes of my RE got some embryos transferred a really good one it implanted. I think going with moderation is best eat healthy but let yourself have some treats too. I really didnt hate that protocol. The shots sometimes were uncomfortable but got pretty routine. My big side effects were tendernessbig ovaries and feeling out of control at times with my emotions. I just took it easy on myself cancelling things that were not important and sleeping when I needed it etc. It seems scary but its manageable you can do it.,infertility,d5i7y8d,2,t5_2saej

8502106,0,t3_4w537c,Lots of factors brought up in this thread alone.  Our take on it We didnt want to waste time with transfers that never had a chance and worst case we didnt want to go through a miscarriage or termination for medical reasons.  We also wanted some mental security if we did get pregnant  pregnancy after infertility sounded like a neverending anxiety ride of what if we did all this to get here and after all that this one is still fundamentally messed up and we just dont know it yet?! so we wanted to be able to calm our fears if something took.  We had one IVF cycle where we froze four decent blasts which sounds awesome but PGS showed three of them were abnormal.  So that saved us potentially months of the emotional rollercoaster doing doomed FETs and prompted us to do one more IVF round to try to bank more embryos.  The three abnormals also werent the possibly correctable kind of abnormal some doctors are seeing results where an embryo tests abnormal due to monosomy i.e. a chromosome is missing but still develops into a normal baby  this might be because a blast segregates that specific type of abnormal cells to the bit they biopsy for PGS.  FWIW our medical insurance covered the PGS biopsy as lab work but obviously not the PGS procedure.  People with no coverage would have to eat both halves of that and thats unfortunately a big thing in the con column.  ,infertility,d64beh9,2,t5_2saej

Which it turned out to be.

8763763,0,t3_5049wo,The applications on our sweet foster puppy have been so far terrible.  The manager of a restaurant we were at applied for her I had told him his schedule wasnt great for a puppy and so did this seemingly sweet older couple whod had a dog they previously loved very much.  Well yesterday I started to get uneasy thinking about my conversation with them.   Foster pup is REALLY wellbehaved for her age and has an overall calm temperament but shes a puppy she gets into stuff still has accidents and doesnt obey every command.  The man kept asking questions about whether she digs and other things puppies occasionally get into that you may have to train out even if shes not into it right now and then he made some comment about her rowdy littermates who are all pretty good puppies.  I started to think that even if she is good theyre not going to accept her puppy behaviors.  Well their application came in while I was at a meeting with our president.  She pulled it up on her phone and it turns out they once turned a dog into the shelter.  They claimed theyd been misled about a blue heeler and that it was poorly behaved.  THEN they mentioned someone else in their neighborhood ended up adopting it and it still looks mournful Because the dog is sooooo sad to no longer be with them?! Dogs dont know cause and effect dumbasses.  So if their neighbors were able to adopt that dog and its doing fine and theyre probably mistaking its welltrained mannerisms that the new adopters worked on for mournfulness theyre DEFINITELY full of shit and cant handle a SHEPHERD PUPPY.  I dont care how good she is at  months she could be a wild adolescent.  She needs consistency training and owners who realize when she does fuck up that its actually them that fucked up i.e. if she has an accident in the house its because you left a baby gate open to a new room or let her go too long without going outside and that is not these people.  Im not eager to get rid of her and she has a home with us as long as she needs it.  Because shes only going to go to the PERFECT home.,infertility,d714r9k,2,t5_2saej

For us its my husband who is convinced we need to try naturally for awhile.If it were me and we were waiting for a funded IVF cycle instead of clinging to irrational hope of winning the free baby lottery I would skip the OPKs but still temp so I had a heads up on when my period will be coming mostly because I have stupid long cycles. As it is for us now even with OPKs and well TI I dont change my behavior during the TWW. But Im convinced theres no hope without IVF for a viable pregnancy anyway they wont even do IUI on me for fear of ectopic. I say do what makes you least sad or anxious.

Havent done a home test in ages because since my body adjusted to being off the Pill what feels like  years ago now my period reliably shows up just before the two weeks are over. For my first  IUIs on Clomid it just showed up  or dpiui so no beta. Last time on Puregon I did go in for the beta because I was also on progesterone for the first time and thought that might mean no period... only to start my period right after the blood test. Same protocol this time just with a higher dose of Puregon.So Im mostly inclined to just be pleasantly surprised shocked if Im honest if I dont have at least spotting by dpiui but may need to home test.

9178200,0,t1_d8fd05t,Theres no downvote no pitchfork from over here. In fact its fine that you are prolife a lot of my family is as well and I respect their beliefs just as much as I do yours. That being said I know the argument youre attempting to make but I feel it is entirely an emotional one. But this gtI would argue that the trauma of being killed is still greater than the trauma of being adopted.To have trauma the fetus would need to be sentientselfaware and theres been a lot of scientific debate about when they are even able to feel pain. Most doctors agree this occurs at  weeks while most abortions are performed before  weeks of gestation. Referencing the article that the OP posted located in the subcortical and deep limbic regions of the maturing brain of a fetus memories will travel with us into our early days of infancy and beyond and more importantly these early experiences set our ongoing physiological and psychological regulatory baselines.Meaning as soon as that child has developed and born they carry traumatic memory deep in their psyche.Im glad you recognize that abortion is a complicated and difficult choice but I personally feel if we are discussing trauma as a deterrent it is kinder to terminate a life that would have been wrought with pain and suffering than let them suffer through life.I hope you realize that this is just a differing viewpoint and not an attempt to debate this issue. Again I respect your ideals but I find the argument you introduced to be lacking and that is all I want to address.  ,infertility,d8fejut,6,t5_2saej

My clinic does the first beta at dpdt but I told everyone  days so I had time to get through all  betas before anyone was askingexpecting results.

Theres nothing we can do except spend a zilliion dollars on a donor and we arent ready for that now. Well think about it again in a few years but we arent going to revolve our life around it at the moment. The bottom line for us was cost. Logically it didnt make sense to spend that much money when we have so much else that we both NEED to pay and in reality WANT to pay. This is the shit aspect of infertility. Suddenly you need to choose what to pay for that most parents dont have to choose paying to just CONCEIVE or pay for a vacation youve never taken. All my friends who have babymoons have no idea how lucky they are they can afford that.Pity party yourself to death with some candy corn and turn off your porch light. Sounds like youre a little logical like me how can you make it work financially? What do you have to do to adopt? What is IN THE FUCKING WAY? At the end of the day all those obstacles may just be there no matter what. Or they may take time. Have you thought about anything else you want right now or in the near future?

Like you weve been at this for awhile going on year five. Each time I think next year we will have our kid and maybe get to stay home every other year to start our own family traditions. There is something about family respecting your holiday plans when you have kids Santa and all that I suppose. Otherwise my husband and his family would never understand why I dont want to be there.I know you all do. Last year right about this time I found out I was pregnant. I made it to weeks before the heartbeat stopped so all through Christmas I held on to the hope that this would be my last Christmas to feel the gut wrenching pain of not having the child you want during the time that it seems to matter most. Everything during the holidays reminds me that I dont have a family of my own. I hate that term BTW I just have no other way of describing the nuclear parentkid family. It was my sixth loss so I was cautious but we told close family who said the normal things that everything will be fine. The day after Christmas we met up with friends at a house full of their kids. A few months later one of them posted they were expecting a girl which is what I lost last January due right around when I would have been due. This year I will go to the party of that same group of friends and their kids because we only see them once a year. I will hold back my tears as I watch that mom hold her baby girl and talk with the other mothers about how fast they grow up. I really hate the holidays. Im glad to know you all are out there. I hate that anyone else shares this pain but it does help to know that even if I dont see you at the party I am at you are at another party being just as strong.

And everyone on the post seems to be echoing your sentiments as well so it helps me know that what Im feeling is validated and okay. I was pretty hurt with her message and didnt want to overreact and send something stupid right away. But the more I read the message the more I started getting upset. I wrote a huge long draft in my notes on what to say but after so many edits and going back and forth I felt that no matter what I said it wouldnt satisfy her. I think even if I said I would try harder she would still be expecting too much from me. I think Im just never going to make her happy in the end. So theres no point in even trying to explain myself. It feels as if shes wanted me to do everything her way no matter the pain to me. That she constantly tells me Im not doing enough even though I tell her Im doing the best I can. But now shes emotionally drained from expecting me to be the way she wants. It seems kind of weird for her to say that and really painful. Maybe she was trying to get a rise out of me or something. Ive kept my cool other than my blow up with my mom for the past ten years and Im just done catering to everyone else while I try to pull myself up and get to the mindset I need to be in for the IVF. Our clinic is  hours away in Maryland and my husband wont be able to be with me for the full  weeks this time. Im really trying to focus on keeping sane the entire time in a tiny hotel while doing the injections and trying to figure out how the heck Im going to give myself the evil Progesterone shots! Luckily hell be there for retrieval though! Whew! I know others go through this as well and Im not the only one but telling someone to knock it off or telling me my infertility is causing them emotional problems doesnt help matters. I would never wish infertility upon anyone but somehow wish people could understand or get a real glimpse into what it might feel like.Oye I feel like a jerk for feeling the way I do and how its causing problems but its all Ive got right now and shes just going to have to deal. Im glad I changed my text too I think the one I sent was perfect and of course she still hasnt responded. But thats okay. ,infertility,dcjn3vd,1,t5_2saej

10402990,0,t3_5ozatq,Given your age Id do another round and bank more embryos. Because even if you transferred this one and it worked by the time you go through a pregnancy birth and get to the point where you might want to try IVF again for another child thats  more years that your eggs have aged. I did my first two rounds of IVF in Feb and March  and was getting retrieval numbers of  . After a break from that second round which involved a mc and recovery time etc I did  more retrieval rounds in Aug  Nov  and my numbers dropped to half. So just  months and numbers dropped way down for no known reason. My point is you never know so Id bank embryos while I could. About the best looking embryo thing  they really cant tell by looking at them. They are making educated guesses but PGS is the only way to know if things are ok chromosomewise.

MicroTESE is my nightmare and you have all my sympathy for going through that.  Im also very sorry to hear that they didnt find anything after all that.Using a sperm donor is an intensely personal decision and I respect your choice and how you feel about it.  I can imagine that this journey has been horrible for you.  My best friends the guys Ive known since high school and were my groomsmen and vice versa all have one or two kids of their own by now.  All of them have sons too and constantly bombard Facebook with photos of baby sized sports and video game themed crap theyre already buying for them.  I look at them with a very intense bitterness and jealousy despite our decades of friendship.  I know that I too have become less happy with life and am generally a lot more negative about...well pretty much everything.  A few weeks ago I basically let loose in an email to them about how much I was hurting.  A few of them seemed genuinely concerned and wanted to do more to support me.  The other half were basically why dont you adopt? and wow but its not that bad right?I understand your perspective on hope.  I dont really have anything else to say except that I feel for you and Im sorry for what youre going through.  Take care of yourself man.  Make sure to get whatever help and support you need.  Ive gone to a trial session of therapy specifically for fertility related issues and I could see it doing some good.  Best wishes to you and your wife.,infertility,dcnb5a8,2,t5_2saej

Unfortunately this kind of disappointment is common for some of us  not everything in the infertility world works out to rainbows and sparkles the first time. The way that I deal with it is by expecting that things can go wrong because we are human and sometimes dont respond in predictable ways.  Try not to draw any conclusions from the failure about your egg quality. Again the only way to see the egg quality is from IVF  and even then that speaks only to that specific cycle.   I wish you lots of peace and rest during your break.

10628426,0,t3_5s1h7m,I got the POF diagnosis at  and was told by  separate REs that donor eggs were my best option as opposed to using my own eggs. I agree on getting your lab numbers. There are a lot of people in this community that are POFDOR and have chosen to pursue treatment with their own eggs but with my numbers it just wasnt something I was willing to bet such an amount of money on for very low odds. We knew we wanted children and when we got this diagnosis we knew we didnt have the financial or emotional resources to try multiple IVFs with my own eggs and then still find a way to pay for donor eggs. We also knew the cost of adoption could be as much or more and with a long wait and could still end in potential heartbreak. I also knew that if I could I wanted to carry my husbands baby. It might not be my egg but I would still be the biological parent and have some control of the uterine environment. While the cost of donor egg IVF is a lot and it causes shell shock for anyone... we talked about it and did some research to find a program that offered a shared risk option  it is k for  donor cycles not incl. meds or travel and if you decide to stop at anytime or complete the cycles and do not have a live birth you get  refund. We have to travel by plane to this clinic but they have a lot of experience with out of state and international patients and we are comfortable with the travel costs. One cycle with no guarantees at my local RE was the same price. Since you said you were on the fence I will tell you what my RE told me when I was worried about having to make a quick decisioncome up with the money because I felt like the clock was ticking. She said that with my numbers the clock has stopped. On one hand that is a little depressing on the other if you are unsure if you want children they will keep you on hormone replacement and keep your uterus nice and plump  direct RE quote until you make a decision. Non fertility wise I have started taking extra vitamin D and calcium supplements in addition to my regular multivitamin and I have continued lifting weights. I plan to ask for a bone density scan at my next regular check up with my PCP just to have a baseline. Im sorry you are in this spot. It fucking sucks.

10711690,0,t3_5t81xx,Im so sorry. That is so painful. I cried a lot after my FET failed PGS normal embryo. I am also unexplained.I have been doing a lot of research before I do another FET so I dont waste all my embryos.A lot of doctors say well lets just keep trying until  PGS normal embryos fail and then we can look into stuff. Yeah I was not totally down for that. Also I felt like more was wrong with me. Woohoo I was right?!? Anyway Im glad I didnt waste all of my embryos with the standard process.Here is the range of reasons your FET might have failed. Basically these fall into three categories bad luck problem with embryo seed problem with uterus soil. Bad luck! Best case scenario theres only a  chance of success assuming PGS normal embryo. Embryo was not PGS normal maybe you didnt use PGS. Embryo had another genetic defect but not at the level of a number of chromosomes  number of chromosomes is all PGS tests for . Embryo had some other defect or embryo lab process wasnt perfect e.g. thaw didnt go well. Blood clotting issue You can get a blood test to see if you have MTHFR PAI leiden factor etc. This is treatable with aspirin andor blood thinners. Not all doctors believe in this for implantation issues but some do.. Immune issue There are a whole range of potential immune issues. Some are treated with intralipid. Not all doctors believe in this.. Endometriosis. Treatable with drugs andor surgery. Used to require a lap to identify now can check for elevated BCL levels with a uterine biopsy ReceptivaDx.com.. Physical abnormality in uterus or tubes. Identify with HSG andor hysteroscopy. Maybe you already had some of these tests.. Embryo transfer done at the wrong time so your uterus was not receptive. Can be checked with uterine biopsy. Igenomix ERAThere are probably more things that I forgot or dont know about.Basically theres a good chance your next transfer will magically work. It was probably the bad luck category. Doctors also have a range of other treatments you can get with your next transfer which may increase chances of success.If you want to do more testing doctors may be resistant but you can do it. It costs money and time but its possible. Its up to you. I wish you all the best.,infertility,ddktwuc,24,t5_2saej

10875037,0,t3_5vfcoi,I think we all have that one person who shares news that blind sides us. My male cousin told me about the start of his infertility journey years before I was even married and how upset he was when his unmarried brotherinlaw was having a baby without any planning. My cousin has yet to conceive and I didnt understand how he felt since IF had yet to be an issue for me I was not married at the time or even thinking about babies.It was not until a very old friend of mine posted on FB that she was expecting again skipping the whole wedding thing first it is just hard for me to understand getting pregnant by accident at our age. And I was for many reasons devastated by this news. Its not like I even care if someone is married before baby and neither did my cousin with his BIL its just being emotionally blindsided that took me a minute. though I did drink too much that night and defriend her...then cry to my momlike really crywhich is sort of when my mom offered financial support for IVF.Im not sure if sharing any of that helps but it seems we all have that one person who takes us by surprise and sets us back a bit emotionally. edit added a comma,infertility,de1ol56,1,t5_2saej

I feel like quitting gluten helps with a lot of autoimmune stuff so you may want to cut that out of your life entirely and see if it helps.

I would also ask if the cost of medications are included towards the lifetime cap if there is one or if drugs are considered separately. Injectable drugs for IUI or IVF are very expensive and the costs can add up quickly. The other thing I would ask about is whether you are free to choose your clinic or if there is a particular one that they force you to use. Also Id strongly advise you to call the health plans and talk to a real person to get answers to your questions. Sometimes things are worded really strangely in the coverage documents and you dont want to misunderstand something. ,infertility,denw281,3,t5_2saej

I suddenly have all this energy that I was totally lacking before. All I have are cramps and that heavy feeling of the inevitable. So bad in fact I had to take pain reliever which isnt even helping.

I also prefer to stay home now even birthday parties are a bit too much for me. But I do try to remember that and I truly believe this them asking us about our struggle is their way of connecting us and making us feel included in their event. My best friend in Indian and her baby shower was traditional when a woman is trying for children in that culture they have a role in the baby shower towards the end where they are pulled up onto stage and basically prayed for and blessed by all attendees  I was called up have been called up to  baby showers now in front of  people. Mine was a little longer than usual as she is my best friend and wants the best for me but it doesnt make it easy having all that attention on you while you bite your cheek to make sure you keep your shit together.

11265471,0,t3_60ry2y,When you say you missed a cycle do you mean you didnt get a period? If so the root of the problem is likely ovulation. If you dont ovulate you dont get the increase in progesterone that eventually drops off giving you your period. If all your tests are normal and you usually ovulate it could just be a fluke cycle and things will resume on their own which seems to be what your doctor is planning. It sucks but even fertile women get annovulatory cycles sometimes. What cycle day are you on?

So I called GoodRx and the GoodRx rep told me they couldnt help me.  The GoodRx rep explained that this Walgreens received the generic drug a from a more expensive manufacturer and was out of stock from the cheaper manufacturer.  Thus Walgreens didnt have to honor the coupon price.   Other pharmacies are  more expensive than Walgreens for this script so Id like to get it from Walgreens.,infertility,dfbo3n6,1,t5_2saej

I hate this policy it is insult to my injury to get up at am and be stuck with a needle to confirm something I already know. Moving forward if we want to do the final IUI right away CD and CD and CD will all fall on days I have conflicts. I will have to call out of work Im a nurse depending on when my period shows up after I stop progesterone Sunday night. I guess my question to you guys is whether you would continue taking the progesterone or stop illegally before then with the negative HPT? In my case if I stop the progesterone early the new cycle days are more favorable with my schedule.

11599083,0,t3_65fw57,First off your medical expenses have to exceed  your agi...which depends on your situation.  Two income families that make like  combined would be looking at k plus in expenses.  For other more modest incomes like our family it might be closer to k in expenses. Either one with ivf...you should have that many expenses.   The next step is that you can only count the amount above that ... So if  was k and you had k in expenses you only have k in deductions.   You can use other itemized deductions too charitable contributions mortgage expenses etc and what you end up with would be your total deduction.  For a couple the standard deduction is like k forget which so if your itemized total deductions are not over that standard it does not make sense to do it.   What I figured is that with the standard deduction we get back say  ...so next year we could get back about that again if we dont itemize.  If we itemize like we plan to do and have about  in total deductions medical over agi charitable stuff that is about k more than the standard deduction so we should maybe get back about that much more in our refund next year.

11636372,0,t3_661x0a,So thankfully puppers ultrasound came back fine. She goes back for a cat scan tomorrow so they can mark exactly where radiation will need to be done which starts on Monday.  It will run monfri for  days. Its going to be a very long month but hopefully it will help her regain even more control of those back limbs. Shell probably never run like she used to but Id be happy to see her able to just get up and move from spot to spot on her own again. For me Ive got a phone meeting with the RE this morning then have to run to a meeting at work then Im stuck there until  because we had a call out. So three hours I wont get paid for. I had to sign up for a class on Thursday which will be another  hrs I wont be paid for. Being  salary is fun! Ive already got a headache so the day is looking promising. ,infertility,dgezuo1,5,t5_2saej

11654403,0,t1_dggzyg0,Id say it means that youre still showing up to this shitty shitty process with vulnerability and bravery and resilience even when hope is so scary it has to be shut out of the conscious mind. ,infertility,dgh1hnc,7,t5_2saej
11670457,0,t1_dghdajz,sorry you are in limbo.  I think you are in the cautious optimism stage right now.  There are definitely success stories out there but no one wants to give you false hope.  When is your repeat beta?,infertility,dgiv1nx,1,t5_2saej

11675758,0,t1_dgjft30,Right you are artipants. Ive never had an STD or any PID. Closest thing I ever had was a gallbladder removal surgery which everyone assures me would not have caused that.Its really fun to tell your nurse MIL you have bilateral tubal disease and immediately have to assure her you were not a dirty whore with all the STDs.,infertility,dgjgp5o,1,t5_2saej

11685943,0,t1_dgklmem,Oh I can totally see that. Up until a few years ago I was a bit ambivalent if we had kids or not but of course I knew I would so it was an easy thing for me to say at the time. Now I wish I could just walk away and be happy with my life currently but thats just not where I am right now as a person.,infertility,dgkmask,1,t5_2saej

11721329,0,t3_67853d,This week bathroom was being remodelled so showers have been hard to come by. Ive also been twatwanded three times in the last six days.The combination of the two has given me a killer yeast infection... Which I have given to my husband.So we are a house full of yoghurtcrotches today.,infertility,dgon5dp,1,t5_2saej
11721421,0,t1_dgolet5,Geez. Isnt it crazy what we will just bite down and do since we started this stuff? I would have put that off before but now time is of the essence! Sounds like you did the right thing  now you dont have to worry about it on top of this crap.,infertility,dgonivh,1,t5_2saej
11728100,0,t1_dgp7znv,I hear you!  I actually started doing the artists way and then I wrote an entire freaking novel which I am now trying to frantically finish in advance of a writers conference Ill be attending.  So you could always try to make a bucket list of things you want to do in life and start crossing them off.  I started my bucket list super simple I wanted to get my boots shined at an airportdont ask me why I just did.  I also took up aggressive hobbies including roller hockey.  My friend swears by krav maga.  ,infertility,dgpesor,1,t5_2saej

11739788,0,t3_67ihy0,Was anybody sort of relieved to move on to IVF? Im dreading the upcoming shots a lot but Im sort of hopeful that Ill get some clearer idea of why this hasnt been working. Also how much worse are the side effects of the IVF drugs? ,infertility,dgqqgrv,1,t5_2saej
11760425,0,t1_dgt2jjm,I could call but youre right. They wouldnt be able to tell me anything without an ultrasound so its kind of a mute point. I live . hours away from the RE clinic. I doubt its torsion since Im  weeks post retrieval. If it gets worse Ill head into the hospital.I dont remember seeing stories of painful cysts after IVF but I wanted to know how common it might be.,infertility,dgt2o3o,1,t5_2saej
