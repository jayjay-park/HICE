1955900,0,t3_2h2yi3,Xiaomi Redmi Note G GPS runs on the latest Android OS v. Jelly Bean with Qualcomm MSM Snapdragon  processor CPU of Quadcore . GHz CortexA and GPU of Adreno . This is a great opportunity for the user to turn and use his smartphone as a GPS device by simply downloading the BackCountry Navigator Android GPS App. Probably the best outdoor GPS app to use when going for hiking backpacking mountaineering rock climbing trekking camping skiing fishing and especially hunting.,gps,ckow0m2,1,t5_2qhah

9460021,0,t1_d9exbn2,I cant use a speedometer which is why Im looking at GPS. I dont really want to get an expensive phone because if I do crash...  But what phones do what you are suggesting?In fact there isnt much I can use to determine speed EXCEPT GPS. Again I would prefer  or hz.Im also not going to be in very urban areas. ,gps,d9f4i6x,1,t5_2qhah
