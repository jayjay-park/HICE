7649094,0,t1_d3avdpx,DISCLAIMER  I am not a financial advisor so if you lose money on the stock market or on something else I am not responsible for anything. Im just a guy.Im not a day trader but planning to become one. I have a few things to share.There are some automated systems out there that are being used by big companies. Surprise surprise even day trading is discouraged by pretty much everybody out there all those programs do is DAY TRADING. Thats right. It doesnt mean you or I can do the same thing with the same or close success rate but thats what it is. Keep your shares its a long term investment dont sell it right away they say. No shit Sherlock then why do you sell it after the price go from . to . and buy again when it declines to .? I dont know whether youre really good at this or not but you cant always sell the stock for a higher price than you buy while daytrading. This applies to high volume stocks too because when some of the big guys place a big order price may change very fast like from . to . or . to .. Another example if they bought the stock at . this morning and if the price is . now they MAY place the sell orders at . amp . amp . not . because they KNOW that they cant sell everything at .. If they place it all at . and nobody buys  million worth of stocks price would go down like hell. They act very professionally in order to keep the price high. When they place an order that big and exit successfully the stocks price MAY go down to . maybe even lower if more people decide to sell in panic. Then what? You dont know when it will happen. Neither do I. But it does. I dont know how stock market is regulated in the USA but I have never heard of a limit on number of trades per day except K thing so you should be able to do pretty much anything you want as long as what youre doing isnt against the law. On speed as far as I know all the brokerage firms servers are located in the stock markets datacenter and theyre offered a fair speed so there isnt a disadvantage on this subject. If the stock you hold has a high volume you should be able to sell it very fast but selling it for a higher price is tricky. Sometimes you have to wait a little since youll be in a queue.Heres an example.Buyers   stocks at Sellers you have  some other guy has   in total  stocks at Given that you are second youll be able to sell only two of your stocks because you are in the line the other guys stocks will be sold before yours.,Daytrading,d3bnrhn,1,t5_2qxlo

You need a six figure trading account to live off of because you need to withstand regular withdrawal to pay for your lifestyle as well as your losses. So thats  drains on your acct. You also NEED to take trades. A lot of times this will make you over trade and start your account into a death spiral unless youve been on demo for  yearsIf you are interested in crypto put all that k USD into bitcoin and come back in  years and it could be the best choice you ever made.,Daytrading,d6kyyt3,1,t5_2qxlo

9511551,0,t1_d9l0jmo,Great question. I use thestockmarketwatch.commarketspremarkettoday.aspx to see whats moving in the morning before the market opens. I pick stocks within my price range go through each one and filter out ones with low volume and too high of shares. Then I take the ones that made the cut and I start reviewing them one by one in my charts. Checking to see if theyve made a move above resistance lines or below supports so they have free range to make big moves that morning. I also check the news for each one and the stocks that have passed all of these tests make my daily watchlist. I open the winners up and then wait patiently throughout the morning for the opportunity to strike! ,Daytrading,d9li18r,2,t5_2qxlo

11085265,0,t1_deohj6c,Heres my basic chart setup Its not the best or only way! I dont mind posting it because its just a tool someone would have to actually move markets in a super odd way to mess with my system DThe way I handle things is I establish key levels. There are a ton of ways to do that I use volumemarket profile and VWAP mostly google it if youre interested. CME has a great free ebook about market profile that would be a great read once you have the basics out of thew ay.I then pay attention to what price does around those key levels. Basically Im trying to figure out whos in control...bulls or bears. If price bounces off or through a key level thats when Ill become active. Heres todays oil trade with a few of the things I pay attention to marked up ,Daytrading,deoi6wb,2,t5_2qxlo
