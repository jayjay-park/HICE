329993,0,t1_cfez0ht,You can shave with either hand using either side. Traditionally you only place the flat side against your face. I feel its safer and easier to shave traditionally and use the flat side only. Kamisoris come in left handed and right handed versions with the flat side oriented to be used comfortably in the dominant hand. ,shaveoftheday,cfez3ub,2,t5_2tp9r

369559,0,t1_cfixaqm,hah thanks man. I do enjoy being able to use these pieces. I think my favorite is probably the Super Wide C. The chrome edges make it that much cooler and the field of view is crazy on it which makes pictures very cool. The view finders on all of these cameras that I have shown pictures of are pretty god damn shitty in all honesty. The super wide is mounted above the camera and is an approximation of what the camera actually sees. There is absolutely no feedback for the focusing on the camera because the view finder is separate. I cant really hold this against the camera considering it was mainly known for being a tremendous architecture camera in which the everything from  feet to infinity will be in focus ratios on the lens work fine. Interestingly you can focus the super wide all the way down to  inches which while producing very cool distorted portraits makes guessing the focus quite a challenge. At least  out of  tries result in a miss of focus for me because the focus range is often  to . inches. The waste level viewfinder to me is mainly a novelty. It is amazing that the picture shows up on the top of the camera so clearly. And on the Rollei it has a little pop up magnifier so you can theoretically get things really focused. Overall all of these methods are a little tricky to get perfect and quite a number of photos have been ruined because the persons eye isnt crisp. If you used the Rollei like it was intended at waist level then its certainly the way to go. The photos are very characteristic when shot like this which is always a fun thing to play with. It also gets the most people interested in the camera which helps when looking for random photos. Being at the top of the camera is a downside if in the studio and wanting to use a tripod. The add on the  works great for use in the studio but again focusing it is stupid hard. All you see is the entire image so when trying to pin someones eye its really quite hard to know exactly what is in focus. I know all these complaints are due to being spoiled by modern technology but it really does get to me especially when each wasted frame is a dollar. When I shoot film I do I usually reach for my s. Its a great size for me. SO much more info than a  but still very portable and well honestly that square frame pleases me haha! The three cameras that I posted cover so many land mark to me years of photography. So many famous photos passed through these cameras most people look at twin lens cameras and think they are jokes. At one point in time these were THE camera. I have several large format cameras but honestly they never make it out of my closet. They are too heavy require too much planing people dont like having their photo taken by them and ill be damned if you cant go broke using them often. I do shoot mm occasionally but its hard for me to justify it because at this point digital really catches up at any level. The pleasure of using film goes down for me when using these cameras because it doesnt feel like as much of an event and the photos seem more mundane. I have several cameras that are  and special so that helps alot. My third Hasselblad is a mm which shoots two mm frame wide panaoramic photos with no distortion and can really make some amazing pictures. ,shaveoftheday,cfj2jfc,3,t5_2tp9r

The head must be very well designed though as I barely felt the blade across my face and had zero sting from the final alum rub.Wickhams hard soap is pretty good.

2696306,0,t3_2qxv98,I found another straight razor at an estate sale a HESS . Hess wasis a hair carebarber supply company based right here in St. Paul. They are still around today apparently but they dont really make what they used to. This razor was in very good condition when I found it aside from the snakelike pitting on one side which cant really be fixed. The scales and pins were basically new. Apparently the HESS  and s are worth a bit of money. In two days my favorite knife shop The Sharpening Center did another bang up job on this razor right here in Hopkins MN. It was buffed and honed professionally and I am very happy with the wicked sharp results.Someone once previously asked me what their sharpening method was. I asked the knifesmith about this when I picked it up. Apparently he has actually been to all the famous razor makers in Germany like Douvo and a few others. He uses the same machines and methods they do and not some cheap stones. I am very pleased with the results. I would recommend them.And as always that Stroppe Shop Black Tie whips up creamy and soft.

Ive only been SR shaving for a couple of months now and while my shaves have been getting better each time I had yet to get close to BBS.  Well that changed tonight.  Philly sliced through a  day growth like a hot knife through butter.  Absolutely the most efficient shave I have experienced.  I usually do  passes and have been getting a perfectly fine SAS but with Philly I got a DFS in two passes.  I think I am in love.        This is also my first time using Cocoa Maya or any Mickey Lee product actually.  Man this stuff is truly truly top notch.  The scent is absolutely wonderful and had be craving a  Musketeers bar.  And the lather quality was just incredible as well.  Thick slick creamy chocolatey goodness.  An easy .  And I lucked out and got it on sale for . which makes it even sweeter.
