Winter waxes wanes whereupon wet will win...Okay serious time now... Warning Fowl language ahead some cussing too.....Night so dark comes crescent moon rising not Ere long shall sun depart from this our sight.Give rise to dark eternal sleep despotHerald to ever coming depth of night..Forlorn gray clouds descend from up on highBringing an omen of the coming storm.Cry out against the cleansing aqua nighThunder descends to cry out so forlorn..Children run out not ready for the coldTruth hits chills bolt through little young ones then.But thee the brave depart from home so boldBring life among barren fields of children..Fuck this Im done I cant continue on.Its shit its cold theres ice see breath move on..,WrittenLore,cm33j8r,1,t5_34kfe
