3550360,0,t1_cpwx961,Ive never really considered myself to be a reader which is why I often visit rwritingprompts creative ideas woven into beautiful short tales able to grab my short attention span long enough for me to read the entire story.  After I discovered your stories upon joining reddit maybe less than a year ago Ive always felt a bit of giddiness when I saw your name in a interesting writing prompt most recently the harry potter and the forgotten house.That said I have never wanted a short story like this to turn into a novel so badly Im a big sucker for romance and the main character doing everything in his power to keep his spouse and future child alive is  in my opinion  a fantastic read every time.  In these short few posts youve made me connect with the MC and want him to survive more than any other literaturegame out there in a long time.Just wanted to say thank you and keep going! Your work is incredible.I was wondering if there was an option doesnt have to be patreon where I could donate a lump sum? My financial situation isnt good enough for me to be able to predict my monthly expenses so Id very much rather give you a large amount now while Im doing well than pledge for a monthly donation only to find that it would run into my budget ,Luna_Lovewell,cpwypxu,9,t5_34cny

3943467,0,t1_cr5rfjy,Dont you recognize it Harry? He was still fighting the plant as though he could escape just by trying hard enough. He didnt respond to me just grunted as he strained against the vines curling around his waist and up his arms. Devils Snare. Youve encountered them before. Dont you remember your very first year when this was guarding the Sorcerers Stone?He stopped struggling. Apparently he did remember.All coming back to you now right? It avoids light and heat but struggling against it makes it grip tighter. A shame that you didnt remember all of that when you still had your wand! The Dark Lord would have wanted Harry to know what was coming. To recognize his downfall. You see Harry I figured out your strength. You are not the bravest or the cleverest or the most powerful... Those all described the Dark Lord. But you do have allies. That is how you have made it this far. When you first stopped Professor Quirrel in your first year you only did so with the help of your friends. You had Hermione by your side to tell you how to escape the Devils Snare didnt you? But now youre alone. And alone you are nothing. I gestured around the graveyard. Let all of this be a reminder. Everything I am using today are things you have faced before. Polyjuice potion portkeys the Devils Snare... all things that you were only able to overcome because of your friends. Every peril you faced you survived because you had someone else there to help you or some magical intervention that you didnt even know about. Some of them even died for you with the misplaced idea that you were something special worthy of their sacrifice! One would think that you guzzle down Felix Felicis like its pumpkin juice! I laughed at my joke Harry did not. Oh come now. Youre going to die anyway. Might as well enjoy what little life you have left. Im not alone Harry grunted. The Devils Snare was snaked around his lungs squeezing the breath out. The other Aurors will come find me. Or Ginny. Or Ron and Hermione!They wont I assured him. I have placed every possible protection on this place. Its harder to find than Hogwarts! You have no idea how long I have been planning this do you?I picked up his wand from the ground it felt warm in my hand the way that only my own wand normally felt. I could feel its power coursing through me. He saw me holding the wand and the last bit of hope left his face. Kill me then he told me.I smiled back. In due time Harry.,Luna_Lovewell,cr5set9,20,t5_34cny
