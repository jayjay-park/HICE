11156614,0,t3_5z90ne,As a warden you dont want attack an orochi head on. You want to bait them into being aggressive force them into doing their side dodge so you can get a parry or GB if youre quick enough. Basically keep your guard top. And watch for his ZA which comes from the right. If he does his dodge forward top light you can parry that easily with practice you can go with a light attack parry that does crushing counter strike or heavy into a free guard break. If you do the light attack parry you immediately shoulder bash into the warden vortex. If you want force him to react Feint a top heavy or side heavy respond to his reaction. Is he trying to parry you parry him If he dodges to the side the attack comes from the same side as the dodge. Parry that into a free guard break and start your mixup. If he tries to dodge the shoulder bash cancel into guard break or feint the shoulder bash so you can get the parry the incoming attack. If he does long distance charge attack its very easy to see which side it is coming from and with practice its easy to parry into free guard break. Practice your counter guard breaks. There is very little an orochi can do against a warden. If you know what to look out for. Im not saying there arent skilled orochi who regularly beat wardens but that up to whether you can read your opponent and outplay him. But in terms of combos and moves orochi has got nothing on the warden. The Orochi has very limited tools top light side dodge light ZA and theyre usually counting on being able to GB you to get the majority of their damage from their top light and top heavy. ,forhonorknights,dewl9kc,1,t5_3iutp

11176211,0,t1_deysmq5,Its hundreds of years old and concerned with how a real knight should behave mostly out of battle even. Which is to say its not something to follow its something to think about. Examine it and see where it could be applicable in the context of the game. There are some good ideas in there and some that just arent relevant.  I dont know I just find thinking about it really entertaining and its an interesting philosophy. Come to your own conclusions on it and what it means to you. For my personal money I like these ones most. gtTo refrain from the wanton giving of offencegtTo despise pecuniary reward Note  Financial reward basicallygtTo eschew unfairness meanness and deceitgtAt all times to speak the truthgtTo persevere to the end in any enterprise begungtNever to refuse a challenge from an equalgtNever to turn the back upon a foeThey feel the most relevant to the game to me and playing with those concepts in mind generally improves the game for me. Makes me feel more like a Knight than an armoured butcher you know?Ive no aversion to using the environment to my advantage or particular problem with my enemy doing the same. I dont expect my enemy to hold to any comparable set of values and expect underhanded tactics more often than not but little things like this really improve my immersion somehow. Trying to avoid fleeing battle standing my ground against foes even when overwhelmed unless I have meaningful tactical reasons for being elsewhere. Never quitting midgame regardless of how tempting it can sometimes be when the enemy turns out to be unfair or unpleasant. Not focusing too much on what rewards Ill get for winning or completing orders and instead trying to appreciate the journey as the primary point of the game etc etc. ,forhonorknights,deyt7dz,2,t5_3iutp
