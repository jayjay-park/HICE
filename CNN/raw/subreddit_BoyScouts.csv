729715,0,t3_22ikg2,Id be happy to help you answer this from a what is SUPPOSED to happen point of view.  Your council should be communicating with your district through the key three at council committee meetings.  Your district key  then meet at district committee meetings and disseminate information through district round tables.  Unfortunately there is no BSA mandate requiring an online calendar of events for councils or districts so you cant rely on that.The next questions is how do I fix this?  First make sure your unit troop pack crew or team is attending your district round table.  Some understaffed districts will hold ONE round table instead of separate RTs.  If your district isnt holding RTs then youve got to do some real work.  Youll have to contact your district key  or if they are unresponsive your council key .Lastly Ill leave you with this thought the reality is that BSA works via volunteerism.  If someone isnt doing a job youll have to step up or work around it.,BoyScouts,cgn80mi,2,t5_2rdd4

3435918,0,t3_2zl54f,YES you can volunteer at any level troop district or council. You just need to reach out to your local council office and speak with any of the executives. They will be able to plug you in where ever you feel most comfortable. ,BoyScouts,cpjx4zg,5,t5_2rdd4

5119113,0,t3_3l462k,I would say it isnt truly necessary to speak to you Scoutmaster about it unless you personally feel compelled to do so. One tip agnosticism  is fine with the BSAs believe in a higher being requirement. You can just slightly alter your expressed beliefs and say you arent sure about the existence of a higher being. No one is truly SURE of the existence of a higher being and thats where faith comes into play. Just follow the Scout Oath and the Scout Law and youll be just fine. One point on that though being reverent means respecting other peoples belief systems as well. So if youre in a household where they hold hands while they pray you should do so as well. Best of luck! And keep Scouting on! ,BoyScouts,cv31mq5,17,t5_2rdd4
7323468,0,t1_d2agzti,OK so here is where an understanding of cultural appropriation and reverse racism is appropriate. Cultural appropriation encourages racial animus against oppressed minority groups. White boy scouts are not oppressed  reverse racism does not carry the subordination aspects of actual racism. In  when OA was founded and used the traditions of the Lenni Lenape tribe who were from that area people born Lenni Lenape who had been displaced to reservations in Oklahoma were forcibly sent to boarding schools in Carlisle Pennsylvania part of their ancestors territory to be educated in EuroAmerican culture in the hope to extinguish Lenni Lenape culture. After five years in Carlisle they could go to Philadelphia next to Treasure Island and only be treated poorly because of their skin color and not because they were Native Americans. Because now they knew how to act like someone raised in a EuroAmerican household in America. America had a systematized practice of eradicating Native American culture for the first half century in which OA existed.   It is a racist tradition and one the OA should set behind it and apologize for. Forced displacement into boarding schools occurred into the s. It is not that hard to see the racism if you look at it from the eyes of the Native Americans.    Like I said find about a half dozen familiar with their tribes cultural practices and ask them if they think OA ceremonies are OK. I think you already know what the answer is.     Note I am not saying that OA is a fundamentally racist organization. It has certain practices that it would be better off never doing again. Scouting deserves a great honor and service society. Not one without honor. ,BoyScouts,d2ammad,0,t5_2rdd4

8577236,0,t3_4x9wo6,Or maybe the BSA and GSUSA could follow the lead of the rest of the global scouting movement and go coed  secular. With kids in both programs and as a leader in BSA and my wife in GSUSA I think its an idea with merit. ,BoyScouts,d6dqkrg,16,t5_2rdd4

9859420,0,t1_dasjaig,I think that you think a scout wont complete a badge without those constraints because you havent prayed without them. I was in a troop without them and when we got partials we normally completed them. I dont doubt that there are some that were never completed but if something else was always a higher priority then that seems appropriate. ,BoyScouts,daspemj,1,t5_2rdd4
