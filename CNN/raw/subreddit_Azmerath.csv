I enjoy a variety of aspects to this amazing game ranging from simple branch mining love those diamonds! to building huge structures. I enjoy helping out other players with their projects and doing unique things in the game. In the real world I like to watch and play soccer. My favourite team is Adelaide United. I do a lot of hiking here in British Columbia. With so much scenery I want to see as much as I can! Im also a real nature lover with a huge love of plants and birds.Build Examples I build many different structures. I have built spawn shops mob farms large towers and lots of naturebased scenery such as big trees. I have built many things on the Minecraft MiddleEarth server including trees for Fangorn Forest walls for Helms Deep hobbit homes in The Shire and a medieval house in Bree. Unfortunately I have no images. I like to try out new and unique builds. Some work out some do not and are ripped down. Only perfect works for me.Greatest Achievement In Minecraft my favourite memory and I guess my greatest achievement would be building that house in Bree on the Minecraft MiddleEarth server. Also being on the We Are Minecraft server and seeing jeb and C build. In real life my greatest achievement would be completing university. I studied Environmental Biology.Previous Servers I have been a part of a couple of small servers run by friends. I was a part of the GodCraftSMP community for  months until it was closed recently. I have been whitelisted on the Minecraft MiddleEarth server for over  years and get involved in projects there when I have time. I was also part of the We Are Minecraft event in early .Other Details  I heard about this server from upads davidca and SlothMojo. Hi guys!,Azmerath,cfd38q5,1,t5_2vttq
