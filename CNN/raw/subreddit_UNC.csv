10515161,0,t1_dczzw71,Are you instate or out of state? That has a big impact on admittance decisions. I wouldnt be anywhere near competitive if I didnt already live here haha. Im in the same boat I slacked off and floated through high school at first. Took too many easy classes and didnt care about grades as long as I passed. I dont really regret anything but its whatever. My grades have definitely improved this semester except for that  in AP stat but Im taking  APs and  other classes this year so my schedule is a lot more rigorous. Hopefully that says something to the admission staff. Looking at their older numbers they dont release total deferred anymore in  they deferred around  and accepted about  so that tells you something about our position haha. On the bright side they admitted over  students last year on a deferral decision so we have that going for us at least. Just depends on who all applies regular decision. Hopefully nobody too competitive lmao.Anyways good luck to you too man! Ill let you know what happens also. March is a long ass wait but its when Im receiving most of my other admission decisions so it doesnt bother me too much. Should be an interesting few months! ,UNC,dd008a2,2,t5_2r3ck
