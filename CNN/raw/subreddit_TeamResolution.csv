6210293,0,t3_40maca,Right now Im pretty upset about my gym training. I dealt with one trainer for quite a while but got burnt out because all we did were squats and kettlebells. Sure different versions but it got so repetitive and he started to set punishments if I hadnt completed a certain amount in a certain time. I am not a child and I have lost lbs thanks to my eating mostly thank you so much. If I am making an effort than you need to acknowledge that not punish me. Punishment motivates him and he doesnt realize that it doesnt motivate me. Instead it shuts me down. So I left him and went to another trainer after the last time he tried to punish me. I love my new trainer and was so happy until she told me that next week is her last week. Now I have no idea what to do...,TeamResolution,cyvjkle,3,t5_3bqwe
6219690,0,t3_40qyk3,Husbands birthday today so pretty excited about that. Making him some proper ramen as its one of his favorite foods that he never really gets. Im considering making a small side pot with some quinoa corn or other wheat free noodles for my mom and I both dieting and both shouldnt be eating wheat. All depends on what I find at the grocery today. Using this recipe losely with menma shitake mushrooms no enoki boo nori soft boiled egg bean sprouts store willing and spring onions. If it looks too light Ill probably add some canned corn. Itll be shoyu style unless theres some good reduced sodium miso available. Itll be meatless because my Dad decided hes making steaks too. Paired with a side of good kimchi as well. Man Im looking forward to that kimchi!Itll all be finished off with a mint oreo ice cream cake. Looks like Ill be having a light breakfast very light lunch and saving most of my calories today for dinner ha.ETA It was delicious! Husbands mine,TeamResolution,cywm0vd,5,t5_3bqwe

6395029,0,t3_438pr3,I am really happy with my lb loss! I was really bummed out yesterday because I saw a big loss earlier this week.. followed by a half pound gain from last week yesterday. So to be down a whole pound today felt really good. Ive been flirting with hitting my  mark. And I know Ive been going over my calories a little bit since the scale has recently slowed down. So I increased my deficit for a little while to see if that gets my food in check.,TeamResolution,czgjrr4,3,t5_3bqwe

6802791,0,t1_d0nayik,Im glad you stuck with it!  I think the key to success is to keep going.  You may have to make some tweaks along the way but giving up is NOT going to get you to your goal.  Good for you.  And Im glad you are feeling better. ,TeamResolution,d0ne19m,3,t5_3bqwe
