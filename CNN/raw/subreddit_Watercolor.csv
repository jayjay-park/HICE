Appliying a wash is sort of important  useful too I think. A wash js the part where you just wet your paper and then Apple the color globally to the page its like the foundation.

4925570,0,t1_cufd57f,Funny I also went looking for white pens at the same time I was looking for waterproof black ones.I ended up settling on thisUniball Signo Broad UM Gel Ink Pen  White InkIt writes pretty thin but Id say maybe its .mm or mm?  I havent found any ultra thin white ink pens that are also super opaque.There are these other Pilot pens that are really great but I found even the Extra Fine tip to be a bit too big for what I needed. Definitely worth checking out thoughPilot Envelope Address Writing Gel Ink PensTheres a Sharpie paint pen that I liked also. It was slightly less opaque when compared to the UniballSharpie WaterBased Paint Marker  Fine PointHeres a quick photo from my sketchbook of the testing I did when I got  different white pensThats testing these  pens. Uniball Signo Broad UM Gel Ink Pen  White Ink. Sakura Souffle Gel Ink Pen  White. Sharpie WaterBased Paint Marker  Fine PointThe top  scratchy marks in that pic are me drawing too quick. I find the white ink pens work best when you make slower measured lines. You can see the same pen had better results at the bottom the last  lines.You can see the Souffle pen is not very opaque at all.  The Sharpie writes very smooth. If it was slightly thinner I probably would have ended up using that one.

Youve done so with the shading in the corners and top but the bottom eyelid which wraps around the sphere of the eye also needs to be rounded.

11398015,0,t3_62h63t,Looks great! Just out of curiosity did you do the background blue wash first and then the dog or the other way around? Im never sure what to do first. Usually if its landscape I just work back to front but not sure if thats the sort of thing to do for a portrait,Watercolor,dfny7zf,1,t5_2td8l
