5853186,0,t1_cxmvbyx,Some interesting stats about the game CAN scored with a nonback player for the first time. Only Wighton Lee Croker Rapana and Waqa had scored for the Raiders in the first  rounds. SYD now have the highest number of scorers with . Only  of their players have not scored points yet the front row and the interchange. Jarrod Croker is now not only the highest goal scorer with  goals he is now also the equalhighest point scorer tied with Aidan Sezer at . On a similar note James Maloney moved himself up to th with  points tied with Sisa Waqa who further extends his grasp on the Ken Irvine Medal Top try scorer. The Raiders seem to have slathered themselves in Vaseline their opponents have had  missed tackles this season and the  highest counts recorded  here and  vs. NZW Each side had  different scorers and there were  players who scored their first try. The only one who was part of that nd group and had scored points beforehand was the Roosters  James Maloney. The Roosters were also facing a green team and this is the th point Ive listed.
