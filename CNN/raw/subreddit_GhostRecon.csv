10213857,0,t1_dbxxpgp,Rainbow Six Siege looks rather well compared to the E footage. The reason that trailer was so engaging was not graphical fidelity but the sheer atmosphere. Sharp contrast lightning with spotlight Drone Camera a far busier scene with a lot of police cars etc. On that score I agree the E trailer looks better but it has nothing to do with graphical fidelity.If you compare it with a video that lacks all that  as the Ubi Downgrade Video does  of course its going to look worse then it actually is since the video does not relay the tension of a match.In fact the lighting in the house is also far different. In the E trailer it acts like its abandoned with fog inside while the actual game more sensible decided it would look like people actually lived there and turned on the lights. Outside is also a fairly good representation of what it actually would look like in many places in the western hemisphere during nighttime. Compact Dark in the summer is a rare thing. ,GhostRecon,dc1sr91,0,t5_2s91l

10765234,0,t1_ddplp3k,Are you implying that we should not be discussing our opinions of the game on an online discussion board? Dont get upset because you dont agree with the people who werent impressed with the game. At the time of the closed beta no open beta was announced. Theres nothing wrong with trying to temper expectations of people who are expecting a hardcore tactical shooter. Regardless do you see me posting on here TOTAL SHIT. DONT BUY THE GAME!? No Im not some shit poster coming on here with no constructive feedback. Ive posted comments on here and the Ubisoft forums with specific criticism of whats broken with the game in an attempt to communicate to the devs how to make the game better which is exactly the point of the closed beta assuming you believe its a beta and not just a demo.Now personally I dont see the SAM sites and drone blockers as making a huge difference to how my friends and I play. The drone is nice but playing with no HUD its not a huge crutch like it is with the HUD on. You can still pretty effectively recon with a few guys and binoculars. The SAM sites might stop me from an easy escape but generally we werent using them to infiltrate just as transport to get from point A to B.These things are great and all but they dont solve the other issues like respawns health regen generally shitty A.I. etc. I think there are a few low hanging fruit changes they could make to at least have the game be playable for people looking for a hardcore experience and there are some larger long term changes to make it a really good hardcore experience. Im just skeptical that they will actually make any of those changes. The game has a lot of potential theres just several major issues that are making it fall short.,GhostRecon,ddqcr5m,1,t5_2s91l

10767933,0,t1_ddqm4v9,First I think you missed my second paragraph. Yes I realize there is a version out there that certainly has fixes not in the beta. I think that much is obvious. The question is centered around people believing that what is released on day  being vastly different than whats in the beta. OK so the game has to be certified. That doesnt really change anything. The beta is  weeks old and the release is  weeks old. The delta between the two stays the same and the point still stands. Unless the process is different for one or the other but if thats the case I would imagine the process being easier for a beta which doesnt work out in favor of it being a far worse build.,GhostRecon,ddqms4u,3,t5_2s91l

A lot of people who bring up criticism of it are downvotes into hell and told off by one of these three responses. The game was already unrealistic . If you dont like them dont use them. People who want realistic stuff are the minorityBring us up to a few months later. Ubisoft adds headgear. Of the very stupid cash grab onlyayearoldcouldlikeit kind. People who voice criticism are treated to the same three responses.Now fast forward to a few months or hell even weeks ago. Dozens of threads asking for more realistic headgear.

10912572,0,t1_de5itwc,Hmm... I wonder if the bodies all vanish the moment you finish combat in an area? That could explain it. I know for me the bodies all vanish literally before I can reach them. Like in the opening part when you interrogate that first guy then go down the watch tower stairs and there is the tent with  guys around it. I killed them from the tower stairs and just in the like six seconds it takes to run down it and reach the bodies nothing remained but blood stains on the ground. Thats when I first noticed it but it persisted throughout my time with the game. Sometimes civilians I ran down or gunned down on accident seemed to remain for a longer time though.Either way not a big deal or anything if that is one of the things they had to crop out or tone down to get it to look that pretty on the ps than so be it even if its really fucking odd to experience until you get used to it. ,GhostRecon,de5jyu7,1,t5_2s91l

Me neither so you shouldnt make claims about the state of the final build until you saw it.But one thing is for certain just by pure logic the closed as well as the open beta build had to be done long in advance before we got to play it. Were talking at least  weeks in advance. Obviously once its stable enough for the public it be a waste of resources to further improve it and put all the changes in that the release build receives. To limit the things you can do in the beta a lot of mechanics could be outdated as well.How do I know this? From observing and analyzing what tons of other games have done and from what tons of devs said after the fact meaning after all the promo hype is over.So please dont make these claims without backing it up.,GhostRecon,de74bzp,5,t5_2s91l

Both have respawning enemies making progress you make in the game feel utterly meaningless. Both have a ton of copypasted encounters all over the map all exactly the same just like Wildlands steal the plane steal the chopper and stop the convoy missions. All the missions boil down to go out kill return except in Division its go out kill loot return.There are differences also of course. Bullet sponge enemies vs shots. Loot system and lack thereof. And so on. But theres enough similarities to make comparisons. Especially when comparison being made is cover system in Division is smooth and responsive but in Wildlands its total shit what gives?

11091898,0,t1_dep95gj,You have to differentiate between real life and game here. The slower muzzle velocity was always a part of suppressor balancing as well as lower damage and penetration. You can nullify the damage reduction via a skill but you will also have lower penetration which is actually a bigger deal than you might think because the armored enemies do seem to take more damage when your penetration is higher. It seems like the game handles armor with a damage resistance system instead of just higher HP. The penetration stat then seems to lower that resistance.,GhostRecon,dep995x,2,t5_2s91l

The techniques used typically draw upon existing methods from the field of artificial intelligence AI. However the term game AI is often used to refer to a broad set of algorithms that also include techniques from control theory robotics computer graphics and computer science in general. Video game AI has come a long way in the sense that it has revolutionized the way humans interact with all forms of technology. This has become more versatile in the way we use all technological devices for more than their intended purpose because the AI allows the technology to operate in multiple ways developing their own personalities and carrying out complex instructions of the user.,GhostRecon,df6cfl9,1,t5_2s91l

In my man squad our sniper sets up at m and has cleared rds of a base before the ground squad  of us with maxed out sneak skills even arrive. Being able to snipe at  his longest is just a little shy of km means hes too far out for the NPCs to even aggro. Also the cal shots most Helos. TLDR Sniping is OP af.

All the people on this sub are the few who can somehow struggle through the buggy repetitive poorly crafted game play and not simply want to play a better game. Longtime Ghost Recon fan here longtime fan of tactical shooters and military realism. This game does not stay true to Ghost Recon tactical shooters or any sense of military realism Bad AI enemy and friendly game play feels like  missions feel like the most boring parts of FarCry and GTA were made into their own game for some reason weapon customization is not meaningful character builds do not exist and the RPG elements are so basic they may as well not be there. The open world is HUGE but guess what? Nothing much to do in it especially when you realize every single mission in the entire game is a copy and paste of some boring archetype missions execution interrogation defense demolition follow capture etc. That doesnt sound so bad on paper but in practice it is literally repeating the same missions over and over in different locations. Very little is done to make missions feel unique or to make provincial story lines feel special or fun. TLDR save your money bro. Just save it.

Things I wish I had done different or knewGet gear as you progress dont go get it all then play.Play through spheres of influence in order makes the story flow better.  i.e. do all of influence all of security all of distribution all of productionListen to and read the kingslayers watch all the vids. Again improves story.Do not do the sandoval missions until you have beaten el sueno the first time. Take your time learn how you like to play the game.Play with friends at least sometimes. Take pictures and vids especially when funny stuff happens.The drone is your best friend.Fast travel breaks immersion.

Or more frequently seeing cartel being captured at roadsides by UNIDAD after taking out Infuence.Ubisoft missed a trick by neglecting this. They could have created an organic narrative unique to certain pathsplaystyles. Discussion about the game would have been greater as people shared their own stories about their route to El Sueno.

11764856,0,t3_67ujgz,I know these are the official patch notes but I feel like a LOT more things were fixed than just these things..First off the HUD changes are HUGE. Good job Ubi that was one of the biggest complaints of the community. These HUD changes give SO much more life to the game imo. It pretty much gives me a way to implement my own version of NG which is awesome But Im not just talking about the HUD. Enemies seem much smarter and can definitely see you from further away than they used to and just seem more alert in generalLast but not least the game just feels in sync now if that makes sense. I dont know how to explain it but all the games mechanics and the open world just seem to be working in perfect tandem now. It just seems more polished. Might be a placebo effect of playing with the HUD turned off but the hour or so I played of the new patch earlier was the closest the game ever felt like to the trailers they showed us leading up to release than it has since it came out. I cant tell you why exactly that is but it honestly just feels like everything is finally working the way its supposed to. They still have a good amount of work to do but this patch has me feeling a lot better about the outlook of the game than I did last week after the disaster that was Narco Road,GhostRecon,dgtkr80,7,t5_2s91l

As a player they have been a little short in the tooth. However half of this is our fault as players for driving the hype through forums such as Reddit.From your list above i only followed No Mans Sky amp The Order  and even then not that closely.Ryse was an Xbox exclusive Duke Nukem was in development so long i thought it was never coming out so lost interest not an FF fan so that came and went without me even knowing about it.
