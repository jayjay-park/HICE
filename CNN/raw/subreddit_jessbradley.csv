10869346,0,t1_de12m7p,A Hello! I want to be clear that I see my role as being a Trans Officer for the whole of the UK  not just England and especially not just London. I live in Manchester and I plan on staying there if elected in part because I believe it would allow me to get out and about in the nations more. Nationsspecific trans representation is all unpaid meaning campaign and volunteers expenses are funded through the nations LGBT campaigns which are underfunded as it is. I commit to fundraising so that there is more money for trans students from the nations to work on trans issues in their areas and for them to stay connected with whats going on elsewhere. I also hope to make good use of online tools so people from across the four corners of the UK can stay in touch and organise together. I will also make sure that I work with nations LGBT officers trans reps and other trans activists to ensure that the resources of the Trans Campaign including my time is spent on all trans students not just the ones in England. Part of this work I hope will be supporting initiatives like the NUS Scottish Trans Gathering continue as well as helping trans students in the nations advocate for their own trans campaigns and officers should this be what they want. ,jessbradley,de13gd7,2,t5_3j72f
