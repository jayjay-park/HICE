2095619,0,t3_2iw98q,BtB has had a competitive community for forever with very good players. Its just a tighter community where each group of players knows all the other teams. Most people just dont bother finding or making a group to play with and go in alone when you find another team though its very competitive and fun. Each map has control points and vehicles are just another power weapon you need to keep alive or kill. I know people dont like h but thats the freshest one in my memory. So on rag slayer for example at start dedicated banshee and Mantis players get in immediately sniper grabs it and initially sits in base watching the laser killing anyone who tries to grab it. Everyone else rushes mid person who spawns closest to ghost gets in a rushes up. After getting laser the enemy banshee and mantis cant move up or just die so sniper another player and mantis stay mid two players go turret and two hold pelican. This is just one example other maps are more detailed in their strats and it takes a lot of communication and teamwork to lock btb maps down against other teams. Then it takes even more teamwork to retake map control from the other team because the score can get away from you fast if people are dumb and make hasty decisions on their own.

6721567,0,t3_47naxm,It seems people dont know what jump youre talking about. I would recommend clambering onto the ledge then not moving once your up there. Next start to move backwards jump then crouch while you hold clamber. It also helps if you look upwards during this maneuver. I would recommend you have hold to clamber set to on. The timing is very important. I find doing a   count works. Where the  is the time youre moving backwards and at  you jumpcrouchclamber.Theres a video detailing this but I cant find it now. I will update if I find it.Additionally this jump is very difficult to pull off repeatedly. If you nail it every time awesome but generally its not a very good jump at least in competitive v play.Edit looks like ukarl posted it below. Good luck!,CompetitiveHalo,d0ekgjk,2,t5_2usxt

10901283,0,t3_5vriqu,Honestly shocked that Devon was the one dropped. Watching EG scrims I honestly felt like Cody was outta place. He seems like he doesnt feel comfortable on that squad. He literally just focuses on not missing never making play calls or anything. But the twins have been around for a long time and will do what they feel is their best chance at being the best again. Very curious to see who they pick up my bet is its Ogre .,CompetitiveHalo,de4e1ov,8,t5_2usxt
10931196,0,t1_de7g7mx,ALG played amazing too but OpTic have definitely not been playing at their usual level. I thought it mightve been his  hour stream when I watched their nV scrims which they lost pretty badly.Theyre a monster on LAN so I have no doubt in my mind that theyll get first at Vegas. Im still looking forward to some upsets though!,CompetitiveHalo,de7h53h,1,t5_2usxt

10972229,0,t1_debopt2,Dude CEpistol was a power weapon.  Its been ranked a top overpowered weapon of all time by countless gaming sitesmagazines for years the other being that zap gun in Doom,CompetitiveHalo,debphxg,1,t5_2usxt
10972758,0,t1_debr3x7,I never played much of CEs multiplayer so youre probably right. My previous comments werent too factually based now that I think about it Edit Im curious what OG players like gre would think about this topic,CompetitiveHalo,debrhp3,1,t5_2usxt
10997871,0,t1_deehdqi,Well... its not discouraging. Its the truth. That was the point of this post. I know Im missing the skill level of an onyx player. I have a scuff Im gonna buy a monitor in a week. Although I still cant believe a monitor really makes that big a difference. But a lot of people are saying it ,CompetitiveHalo,deekpnf,2,t5_2usxt

11323369,0,t3_61lsk4,Pretty decent article. I was thinking the title is rather unnecessary but I guess if youre trying to catch more people with a lower common denominator headline I see how focusing on the region aspect of Worlds is the way to go.,CompetitiveHalo,dffhh74,3,t5_2usxt

11592465,0,t3_65d759,True! Very true! This goes for all playlists not just for Summer HCS. It pisses me off when I see people that have Mics on and none of them use it ESPECIALLY IN DOUBLES! WTF...Your Xbox One came with a mic and those last forever. No. Excuses.I swear people be creeping. It sometimes feels like they get off on hearing peoples voices. Ducking creeps.,CompetitiveHalo,dga0ipj,2,t5_2usxt

11685088,0,t1_dgh0ltr,Frosty is immature. Hes the youngest kid on the team and he looks up to lethul not the best role model. Problem is when lethul trolls someone you know hes just trolling and even when hes being harsh it comes across as funny light hearted not serious. When Frosty does it he just comes off like an asshole because of his tone.,CompetitiveHalo,dgkit1a,2,t5_2usxt
