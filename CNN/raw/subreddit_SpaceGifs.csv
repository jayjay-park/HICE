1455628,0,t1_ciyp7bw,Theyre stable for various reasons depending on where theyre located. One example is Jupiter trojans where they have the same orbital period as Jupiter and essentially orbit  of its Lagrangian points. Other bodies might form resonances technically a Jupiter trojan is a  resonance with other planets so that they will never collide. Pluto is an example because while it crosses Neptunes orbit it will never collide due to its  resonance.Other bodies still are simply so far out that they will be traveling very slowly and are very spread out so impacts are few and far between.If a large object happened to pass close to an asteroid belt it would throw the equilibrium of the system out of balance and many objects would either impact other bodies burn up and collide with the Sun or fly out of the Solar system entirely.,SpaceGifs,ciyql6b,2,t5_2x60o
