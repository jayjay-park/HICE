11086785,0,t3_5x4ufr,I woke up early on the rd and got to my local WalMart at about am. Sold out. Drove  miles to the next closest down really sloppy snowcovered roads they had  left so I got one. Spent the whole weekend playing Breath of the Wild.And then yesterday it got the Blue Screen of Death and bricked. Decided after reading others accounts of the error that it was hopeless to try and get it repaired and that my save data was fucked anyway so I returned it and got my money back. But Im pretty sure no store in my entire state has one in stock so Ill probably be waiting a while. I refuse to pay the scalpers prices.,NintendoSwitchDeals,deooe47,8,t5_3h4em

11273358,0,t3_60w7g8,Just called my store after seeing they just got   a new shipment on istocknow before seeing this post and they told me about the bundle too and that they ran out of individual consoles.

11276787,0,t1_dfa2epw,Amazon is being a little shitty too. Only releasing units via Prime Now and their retail stores to get what they want out of these console sales too.I dont get why Amazon lets me order the Switch stand when it say arrives in  months but I cant just order the Switch with them and get in line to ship as soon as it comes in.So they are all shady. Just Gamestop more than any of the others.,NintendoSwitchDeals,dfa7h8r,1,t5_3h4em
11287147,0,t3_6133ev,Its gonna vary wildly. Ive worked at Three Targets in PA and Two in FL and it was a different experience every time with shipping. Some were overnight shipments some came in w UPSFedEx midday. The one thing that is true though is that online inventory and store is usually way behind actual numbers. Only time you can really trust that is with items that have regular bulk stock. ,NintendoSwitchDeals,dfbdr4d,2,t5_3h4em
