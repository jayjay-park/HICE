2670776,0,t3_2qj6tj,gt As of Friday evening police said they had no updates about the shooting which occurred when a gunman fired up to  bullets at a car containing the five teens as they sat parked on a desolate street just three blocks from the Grosse Pointe border.This is what makes me scratch my head.  How hard...honestly can it be to find a tangold caddy in East Detroit  esp. if the driver has an AK and is apt to fire it for no reason.  It seems to me the police have given up on this case which is fin absurd.  This case could be solved and justice served.  I honestly feel like heading out and digging up my own clues.  This is stupid.,GrossePointe,cn76z6j,1,t5_2us3c
