1106907,1,t1_chttpd7,gt Its just too similar to battlefield to be called a different franchise.How do you even know that at this point in time? Did you get to exclusively play it? Because for me it is a totally different animal. No tanks no IFVs no Jets planes admittedly but propeller driven planes no jets we havent seen boats yet. Its just not the same. It doesnt follow the tradition.Im not saying that this is going to be a bad game in no way could I justify that. Just let me play devils advocate a little and tell you that in  years from now we maybe have  more Battlefield titles. And thats what I fear I fear that the franchise will become a annual whoreevent like poor CoD is as we speak for EA to produce money.,BF_Hardline,chu42f7,-1,t5_31ycr
1113816,0,t1_chutfx3,Actually I think most of the negative buzz is just in the Battlefield subreddits. I was curious the day the video leaked and there was all this negativity.

1119017,0,t3_26x46l,Honestly I dont mind that they have it go with last gen. Unlike some of those PC master race tards out there I believe that the game will be enjoyable regardless of how much it is held back.Personally I am ok with it being on last gen also. I own a PS and am very pleased with my copy of BF even though it was supposedly held back by last gen.The fact of the matter is whatever we say will have no real affect on EAs decision to go with both generations. The game is going to be developed with both generations in mind.,BF_Hardline,chvhqop,3,t5_31ycr

I quite enjoyed conquest assault actually but to be honest taking a flag is the least enjoyable objective type in these types of games. I want to be doing something while Im getting kills something that I want to do  Rush is a step in that direction but its flawed and the reason  of the community plays it is because the maps in bf are not structured for it because they try to make every map fit every gametype and they turn out awful for it. Wouldnt Operation Locker be much better if they just made it a p only map instead of trying to shove  players into it? Wouldnt Zavod be much better as a rush only map? Well bad example that one is okay conquest but you know what I mean right? I think they should shift more into making specific maps for one or two gametypes rather than shoving everything everywhere.,BF_Hardline,cic7k8z,-1,t5_31ycr

You just have to make sure the vehicle is perfectly still when trying to attach a bag to it. It does give a bit of an advantage but not a huge one. All it does is let your passengers regen ammo and health between battles but it has little effect on the outcome of each battle because your passengers still have the same amount of max health ammo and same reload speed and damage.,BF_Hardline,cja26xl,1,t5_31ycr

3023480,0,t3_2uswnt,I played for several hours straight in the heli.  I encountered some bad pilots who never got enough altitude to allow the gunner to fire at all but worse than that twice I encountered someone bashing the helicopter into the ground shortly after takeoff so that I would get out and their friend could get in.  If I got out to repair for instance their friend would spawn on them and steal the gunner seat from me.This is something youd be less likely to see in hardcore mode because the person would probably eat a rocket as they tried to fly off.  Then again there are no kit launchers in Hardline.  Im not sure what Id do to dissuade vehicle stealers.,BF_Hardline,cobdpv6,1,t5_31ycr
3024050,0,t1_cobfcjf,Take Carbines for example and I only use those because they are available for all kits. At around M which isnt that far they become a  shot kill. If you shoot  accuracy which  of players probably dont thats  bullets to kill. It becomes a  shot kill at M quite close. Thats your entire  round mag for one kill assuming  accuracy which again only describes the upper echelon of players.Thats too much in my opinion and I really dont want to see Hardline go that way.

Either way Hardline is  maps half of the weapons are from previous games there are a few added gimmicks like zip lines stolen attachment models from MOHW BF BF and maybe  new ones for the snipers.By your description of a DLC this game is about .

3029762,0,t1_cobfwqg,Oh come on. Enough with the negativeness.gt Aim Assist?What about it? Its pretty much necessary on consoles or else it will be extremely difficult to aim accurately at someone with the sticks. I cant think of a single multiplayer FPS game on consoles that doesnt have aim assist so why is it such a bad thing for Battlefield Hardline? Everyone will still be playing under the same conditions and if you still dont want Aim Assist you can go ahead and disable it in the options.gt Graphics much more simple and childish than BF. Colors arent rich. Everything seems washed out. Cartoony perhaps?Ill never understand how graphics can be considered childish. Simple sure but never childish. A game doesnt have to be realistic or gritty to appeal to an adult audience. Can you show me a game that can be considered childish purely because of the graphics? Read graphics not art style or designgt Ammo and health takes much too long to recharge. Makes having a second med pack pointless. Perhaps this was intended to make people die faster to increase the speed of gameplay.I believe the reason it takes so long to throw out a new ammohealth kit is to make the gameplay a bit more strategic. You have to actually think about when and where you place your ammohealth kits instead of just throwing one out without much thought put into it.gt Seems like Hardline was made to appeal to the mass of COD kiddies who didnt want challenging calculated gameplay. This is very unfortunate because I was a die hard battlefield fan. The franchise has been ruined by the creators clearly trying to steal the COD fan base.Really? Yes its more fastpaced. No its not any less challenging than previous Battlefield titles. Youre saying that you were a die hard Battlefield fan? You know you dont have to play the latest Battlefield game. People are still playing Battlefield Bad Company  and Battlefield . If I was no longer a Battlefield fan because I didnt like specifically Battlefield Hardline in then I wouldnt consider myself a Battlefield fan at all.Im sorry if I come off as harsh or offensive but Im just getting sick of this whole thing where people keep saying its not a Battlefield game because the TTK is different from Battlefield  or because there arent any planes in it.

3050496,0,t1_coe2mhi,Not to mention that the weapons for each faction are balanced VERY differently. For instance I love the AKM but the M and MA inherently better and I would take them over the AK any day of the week. Theyre just better all around.  I can see why Visceral made factionspecific weapons but it really isnt a good idea. This goes back to BF. The starting weapons for the US side were twice as good as the starting weapons for RU. Dont get me wrong the RU weapons were good but you had to be experienced to use them effectively. This was apparent when the game was free for a while. It was VERY common for a team of noobs on Canals TDM using the US starter weapons MA MA M IAR Mk MOD  all amazing and very easy to use to destroy a team of noobs using the RU starter weapons AKM AKSU RPKM SVD former two being decent but requiring some knowledge of how the guns worked and the latter two being completely inferior to the US equivalents. What Im getting at is that the crook side also has inferior weapons compared to the cop side at the moment this is really bad no matter how good you are. Sure you can get a weapon license at  kills but thats quite a few kills and it will take a while. I think Visceral should either rebalance the robber weapons to be similar in stats and handling to the cop weapons or take out the factionspecific weapons. A game isnt fair and fun if one side has the advantage in the most basic form of combat. ,BF_Hardline,coe6khi,3,t5_31ycr

While its always a good idea to take a different route be unpredictable etc. at the end of the day there are only so many different routes you can take. This is especially apparent in Downtown because it is much more restrictive than Dust Bowl where you can offroad and avoid traps.My point is that having RPGs available to any player in any sedancoupe will further instigate this problem.

3324143,0,t1_cp6crle, Definitely having separate camos on different partsattachments on guns. It would make for some cool unique combinations. I would love to see gun naming like CSGO. As uINFsleeper said showing the name next to the gun for example swagKILLR MA|LvLCs Bae dirtydeathdogor maybe even only in the KillcamDeath information shown to the player killed by the gun Dont know the technical term Example P.S Sorry I cant edit. Like others said Laser Sight and RDS colour customisation An option to add personal touches to weapons from unlocks in battlebacks. The items of which im referring to are things like the bandages on the MA in BF or the wet cloth on the scope in the Vietnam DLC of Bad Company. Im sorry but Im about to pinch another CSGO idea. For every  kills you unlock a weapon finish on the gun to do with wear for example Minimal wear Field tested Well Worn Battlescarred.  You always start with factory new but as you progress kills you can select these other wears to add scratches and dents and reduction of shininess and gleam.Thats all I have For now feel free to PM me if you want to pick my brain some more.

3441039,0,t3_2zn23l,I like the game but from a new player there is one problem with Hardline. BF and BF really worked to make every gun competitive but good at different tasks didnt always exactly succeed but they tried. Your starting weapons in BFamp were solid weapons maybe not your favorite but pretty good. Hardline however starts you with overall inferior weapons for operator and mechanic. When you start you are going to be outgunned in every firefight. So Id say if you do try it understand that until you make some money and buy an M or M things might be extra tough. Dont get discouraged too fast if things dont go well it doesnt take long to make money. ,BF_Hardline,cpki5vo,2,t5_31ycr

3466173,0,t1_cpmm0dz,My point was more that the game should at least reward aiming a little more.  Clipping the bumper with a pistol should not do just as much damage as a shot through the engine.  Specifically though the k is realy brutal at close range and pretty much an instakill due to the RPM way more than any other gun that has similar purpose.  Its overperforming everything else in its area which is the problem.  ,BF_Hardline,cpnda2f,1,t5_31ycr
3468780,0,t3_2zz54t, I unlocked the knockout a day ago and have noticed a lot of people have trouble getting the camera coins for the mac and the knockout I thought I would just share what I did to get them.  All I did was join  player tdm servers and place cameras in high up locations facing high traffic areas. I have found that using the grappling hook to get up on top of trucks is a great place for cameras on most maps. They will rarely get destroyed because no one is checking for them on the trucks. The cameras have about a  meter detection range and spot one person at a time. Whenever a camera spots someone you will hear a beeping noise then you have to pray one of your teammates kills the spotted person. If you are going for these camera coins take your time to find a good spot to place them. Dont just put them down on the graound or on a wall because you can. Run around climb up on to buildingscarsterrain and find some good spots. I died a lot just trying to get them down in  player tdm because the spawns are crazy but if you take your time it is doable. There were games where I would get  coins in a single match.  Hope this help,BF_Hardline,cpnnzhu,2,t5_31ycr

Games will typically last all  minutes. You can reach rep tier  in these games without any boosts after around  minutes of straight driving an objective vehicle. So far this is the only way Ive found to reach tier  without any help from a Hacker.

Whats interesting it is often NOT a one shot kill but does  dmg. As I wrote in another place I dont find it particularly special. On some maps its ok but the bullet drop and speed are terrible. It only works if the guy dont see you and is within m which is rare. If he sees you your are in  cases dead if he has any automatic weapon.Imho Scout Elite is overall better and on medium distance DMRs are easily holding the ground if not better against . Knockout.

Markers outside the objective spots it means something important is over there xD like for instance a spawn beacon or a lot of cash xD But being a hacker I can easely tell when people are going for the objective or just for kills.

Unlocks should be fun not a frustrating long grind  I feel like they did this because of the lack of content also if you look at other games where everything is unlockable in the first few weeks of playing Titanfall just about everyone quit playing.

If youre boosting with a hacker helping you then I dont feel thats any different than going on a no kill hotwire server and driving in circles. ,BF_Hardline,cqa3px8,2,t5_31ycr

3672989,0,t1_cqau7yv,Things are resolved after a map change because people leave and the server autobalances. But if no one leaves or there is only a  guy difference it doesnt scrambles the teams. I think that there should be a scramble system that triggers if the round was too one sided final score and that only moves entire squads squad A from team  goes to team  and squad C from team  goes to team . I even think that this would be easier if they took skill the stat into account and having the sum of it being similar.

3838776,1,t3_34egac,As it currently is... it allows you to build on class experience where only the van gives that similar option. But seeing that Dustbowl on x has only vans and tanker then that advantage does not exist at that point. I would think at least a slight  increase in how fast points are accumulated would make it that much more used? Or better give the tanker a ticket perk. Where if it is driven it equals   vehicles occupied. Meaning if one team has  faster vehicles and another team has only the tanker then it will equal out the burn and no ticket loss will happen for team driving only the tanker? Making it a very desirable vehicle for ticket burning regardless of its undesirability due to its easy destruction and slow speeds.   ,BF_Hardline,cqtuqwe,3,t5_31ycr

3844364,0,t3_34etxl,I think the main issue is that the rented servers have to offer something the normal servers do not and we have very little control over what we can change on the rented servers. Hence if youre running a normal game mode server with a slight tweak like increased tickets or hardcore your server falls into the majority of rented servers and is likely not going to be seen. The only ones I see filling up consistently are servers with unique but sadly unenforceable rulesets such as pistols only melee only or hotwire boosting servers. Unless you are renting a server for your platoon to host matches on or running a boosting server there arent many reasons your average player would seek out a rented server to play on ,BF_Hardline,cquhpdk,2,t5_31ycr

3853080,0,t3_34jsgd,Count me in as well I too prefer Hardline over BF.  The number one factor for me was the improvement in the fluidity of movements.  No matter how much I increased the sensitivity in the previous installments I just could never get comfortable with it.  Granted I havent played BF no where near as much as I have with COD but I always felt that the two franchises were on the complete opposite ends of the spectrum in that particular area.  So in that regard my preference has always been COD over BF even though I had more fun with BF.  However when I played Hardline I was pleasantly surprised with Viscerals tweak of the movements.  I dont know if it was a strategy on their part to draw players away from COD but for me it was enough to bring me back.  And as a result Ive stuck around and even purchased the premium. ,BF_Hardline,cqvhiu5,8,t5_31ycr

3893276,0,t1_cqzy50o,I have the very same thing with the DB. I also notice I get killed a lot when bumping into enemies. I directly hip fire and hear my shot sometimes two from double tapping see hit markers die and then see the guy walking away with  health. I mean I sometimes even hit them in the middle of the chest from a distance where I could slap them in the face and I still seem to die without doing any damage. My theory is that there is also lag between tapping the button and when the shot comes out and at the time when I hear the shot and see the hit markers Im already dead on the server from the other guy firing at me. So I die and he walks away unhurt. Does that make any sense?,BF_Hardline,cr02fqu,1,t5_31ycr
3894879,0,t1_cqzw14p,The way Hardline is setup you can get more points going against a hacker because it unlocks the ability to get Trace points. As long as you play conducive to maximizing points youll tear shit up. Never ever scare off lower hackers   Only Trojan their scans never their backdoor   Running Trace is your  priority   Rotate Backdoor on uncaptured spots   Set POI to nonmoving targets that are hot beds   Drop scans over known enemy locations   Drop EMP over known friendlies   Priority should be given to spots that overlapThats pretty much the only rules to maxing cash versus an enemy hacker,BF_Hardline,cr090tm,3,t5_31ycr

3916843,0,t1_cr2q3np,As a PC gamer my biggest complaints about Hardline are related to the fact that it has to complete with BF and it cannot.  The high weapon damage in Hardline makes it feel like you almost never get a chance to react.  That is rarely the case in BF.  The spawns in Hardline suck.  Since they are fairly static they are easy to camp.  Not too many levelsgame modes in BF have that problem.  The is no Battlemap for a second screen.  This is really helpful if you have multiple monitors since you can look at the overall flow of the battle and plan where you need to move next.  The boost system is annoying in Hardline compared to BF.  It is overly complex and can effect the scoreboard when it should not be able to.  Hardline if you have a good PC looks crappy compared to BF.  I believe this is because of the art style they went with but when you compare both games with the graphics turned all the way up Hardline just doesnt look as good.That is just the stuff off the top of my head.,BF_Hardline,cr2r83r,19,t5_31ycr

Most weapons are extremely powerful and have a very short TTK with a minimal damage drop which only compounds the problem.

5660015,0,t3_3sloqk,Server customization for consoles would be huge imo. Such as server settings for restricted weapon choices and the choice of opting out of having a hacker. This could allow the benefit of having servers running pistols only no CRPG for Hotwire aka classic Hotwire etc. The issue with console server restrictions is that an admin has to be on and has to kick a player for breaking the rules which is inevitable but they are never on.The gameplay in HL especially for daily players is getting a little stale atm and it seems as if we are just sitting around waiting for dlcs now and then get bored after a couple of weeks. Having these server settings would be like adding multiple game modes to the game without the devs having to do it.

Anyway good podcast.I have a few questionsobservations about the whole podcast though if I may. Q The dev gave us a few hints about the settings of each map from the last dlc the Betrayal. He hinted that one map is a reference to the movie The Rock with Cage and Connery so its quite possibly an Alcatraz prison setting. The next one is inspired by the first gremlins movie it is called the chinatown in the cte files so it will probably be a snow map with lots of little houses like in the movie Iam excited. Another one will probably be some kind of Tomb map Zach used a National Treasure with Nicolas Cage in it so its possible it will be in some kind of tomb or something sounds exciting. The last one is the one that is in the CTE right now the thin ice. Its basically an air base map covered in snow under a huge mountain it looks very cool and there are lots of little routes everywhere I liked the little bunker under one of the objectives the central capture point is a crashed airplane so its awesome. I wonder if the hotwire mode on this map will be with the snowmobiles. Q I saw in the options menu under the gameplay settings that you can see the player outfit changes it can quite possibly mean that we will be able to customize player outfits aswell as weapon camos possibly vehicle camos aswell? who knows. Anyway Iam excited for this one thats for sure. Q Iam really happy to see the trusty old m sniper rifle in the game but at the same time Iam disappointed there isnt any M Garand its basically the most iconic weapon of all time quite possibly and I and many others requested and begged visceral to give this gun to the players. Well maybe in next hardline game then... Q The next thing is about the new guns there are lots of new guns for hardline coming with the last dlc the list is as followsAUG A  a highly requested gun it isnt the classic Steyr Aug with the attached scope but at least its something RPK  its basically a rpk without the drum mag I dont know the exact stats so I might be wrong M  a classic sniper rifle its a beautyThe Mammoth gun tripple barrel shotgun  a very nice shotty similar to the double barrel already in the game but with more recoil and  more round a triple barrel shotty because why the fuck notA S harpoon  a one hit kill harpoon gun with slow reload but mightySyndicate gun  its quite possibly a Lewisn Gun an old WW  heavy machine gun it kicks like a mule but its a heavy hitter.MX for the mechanic class  its possibly coppied from bfdual skorpion vz.   akimbo machine pistol this one is really fun.M shotgun  I dont have anything to say about this oneMB sniper rifle  the one that was in bf and in bfImprovised machine pistol  a nice little handy machine pistol for the professional class with a cool looking improvised suppressor in form of a canSPAR X  dmr with a cool soundMP  handy little machine gun for professional new melee weapons including an inquisition sword a meat cleaver showel and a bunch of knives like karambit and another one looking pretty sharp wtih a cool name called devils toothpick Q Zach was speaking about the competitive matchmaking and he knows it has some minor issues and they are looking into it. I hope they will be adressed in the next upcoming patch the priority should be getting rid of cheaters then balancing the teams and reducing the countdown timer and letting other players from friendlist play in the same team.,BF_Hardline,cz7ze7s,2,t5_31ycr

The seperate PC profile was my idea a while back because gun handling is so much different than on console and this will allow those changes to PC without messing with the console and vice versa.  The TTK increase is not going to be to the level of BF so dont worry.  Well run it through its paces next week and see how it plays out.

9007091,0,t1_d7u64d0,I definitely like the idea of a daily or weekly mission. Not to sure about Halo however this was a feature in Rainbow Six Siege although poorly implemented there. The challenges for R were repetitive and stupidly easy. Get  headshots in Terrorist Hunt Get  pistol kills in MP The second part that they clearly dont understand is the effort to reward ratio. Most people seem to be flush with cash and considering the fact that you can buy Gold Battlepacks whenever you want it makes it really hard to motivate people to go out of their way for such a mundane reward. How about mixing up the rewards and giving us something fresh? Maybe through a Weapon License or a unique camo our way?,BF_Hardline,d7uieyt,1,t5_31ycr
9069627,0,t3_54arz9,The  all class weapon is where its at.

9707123,0,t1_da9geuh,this.No weapon is unbeatable on the battlefield. Just need to know how to play to the weapon instead of trying to use the weapon to your play style. Some people are going to be able to do it and others maybe not.When I first started out playing as Enforcer I was having a hard time using the Battle Rifles. But after playing through Mechanic and Professional and then coming back to Enforcer to start getting some of the class assignments complete I learned to use them in game. As uvvn stated the FAL and SCARH are excellent choices for the class. My favorite weapon of the Enforcer class oddly enough is the MA. Yep a pistol. Used it for a few Community Missions and fell in love. Also I used to not be able to get any shotgun kills at first but now using them they too can be very dangerous with their single shot kills and can rule close combat situations.  Also dont leave out the Bald Eagle... Enforcer simply is even dangerous with its sidearm choices. And the turtle shell on your back when playing Enforcer makes enemy think twice about shooting you from behind. Edit let me put it this way. Sometimes I allow my  year old to play a little multiplayer and when doing so most of the time I tend to put him as Enforcer with turtle shell and MA or FAL. To date it allows him to survive the longest out of the other options. ,BF_Hardline,da9m0ba,1,t5_31ycr
