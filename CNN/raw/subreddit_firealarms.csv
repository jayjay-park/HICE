2942777,0,t3_2tu1ox,I set this up in my garage. Works with  v ah battery and a bulb from auto zone that I installed in an old beacon. Box wont reset unless you reset the pull first. I also installed a micro switch that opens my garage door when you pull the hook box. ,firealarms,co2luz0,1,t5_2w2hx

8074848,0,t1_d4jkz6o,CFAAASTTBCFor your Canadian technicians.However I find that a certification doesnt necessarily make you a good technician.Getting a tech who spent  years with the bigger companies like EST Simplex Honeywell etc. is generally a good start as in that time they most likely have received some decent training.,firealarms,d4not4o,1,t5_2w2hx
8283382,0,t1_d5cj5ci,Honestly this bugs the ever loving shit out of me. I was sent on a service call and this panel was in a narrow hall that I had to travel through multiple times to get the alarm system functioning. I figured I would post this here because this is an occupational hazard that we all face on a day to day basis. I dont plan to make it a habit to post stuff like this but lets be honest. This is a fire waiting to happen. ,firealarms,d5czd4h,2,t5_2w2hx

9694490,0,t3_5duy2p,I dont know about silent knight panels being able to do that. the electrical tape or a soft ear plug in the piezo will do it temporarily while youre working on it. fix the troubles and you wont have to hear the beeping Simplex panels you can disable the local and remote piezos. great for hospitals where there is a annunciator at each nurse station through the three building.,firealarms,da81ve6,3,t5_2w2hx
10102344,0,t3_5khoi5,A lot of fire alarms use bell trigger. They probably have a fire rated combo panel that is listed for both burg and fire. We have done this several times. Its definitely not the preferred method. Basically the whole fire system is acting as one fire zone on the burg panel. DMP is one combo burg manufacturer you can do this with. You can have the fire panel send in a fire alarm fire trouble fire supervision this way. It just wont narrow it down to pull station or smokes,firealarms,dbocjfg,3,t5_2w2hx
