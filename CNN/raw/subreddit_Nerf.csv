223698,0,t3_1wmrak,alright dude so I just modded mine. first things first when modding I had a not so tough spring so I put a trimmed down spoon and added a spring where the trigger pulls the thing where the air releases. it helped me a lot! also i plugged the pump but you should put E tape or plumbers tape so it makes a better seal not perfect because you dont want vaccum for it. cut the black tube and buy a CPVC coupler for it.  inch! Im not very familliar with hoppers and wyes are kinda hard to get here but I dont feel like ordering online. i just made an RSCB hopper for mine and it works great. I held most of my stuff together in the gun with hot glue including the coupler because Im too lazy to use epoxy. Its quite easy. also when cutting the tube make sure not to cut to much where the  looking thing inside the barrel stays perfectly fine. You may need to sand the inside of the coupler for it to atatch then keep it with hot glue or some other adhesive. ,Nerf,cf3xabz,1,t5_2qz7g

1022569,0,t1_chkilbm,So take from this what you will but it is always better to have ammo for a primary than a secondary. Ive carried secondaries in HvZ and have never needed them once not counting socks. Carry those I think an  round clip is smaller than a hammershot and obviously holds more rounds. You will either be safe enough to reload or youll need to run. If you need to run youll be better off with socks than hammershots. As for HvZ carry socks. Theyre  percent reliable. And choose what style you want before you leave your room. Because you probably wont just be able to switch blasters or drop a rapidstrike throughout your day. Either go heavy with a rapidstrike extra mags and socks. Or go light with socks and a pistol. Side note on scavenging you cant screw up loading a triad. But in the heat of battle its very easy to load a hammershot wrong so that you dont have a dart in the right spot in the cylinder think Russian roulette. And if you are going for tacticool get  triads and tie the priming handles together. Its a much smoother way to use  blasters than thumb  priming hammershots ,Nerf,chkitos,4,t5_2qz7g

Using a chronograph seems like too much work to them.gt ...Id be fine with chronograph testing of blasters prior to play. I dont know how many others would be though.Honestly I dont know how people can turn down the idea of a chrono.Combined with simple regulation of ammo types it potentially offers a gono go safety check which may not be perfectly fair or perfectly accurate but it still far superior to present methods.If it can work for paintball and airsoft it can work for us too.As to players being OK with it I dont understand how any would not be OK with it unless they are guilty of something that they fear is going to be found out by the instrumentation. Say they are hiding something about their stock OPV B Nominally passed by blanket allowsblanket bans.It really frustrates me personally when I want to go to an event and no one can give me a velocity limit to know if I will be driving a gazillion miles to get my gear banned.

We just didnt see that as a review so much as an unboxing which is how he labeled his video.  By the way Rob we asked the guys at Nerf in NYC about why you Aussies dont get as much love as we do asked this specifically at your request. The top global brand exec said you should because even the day before our event in NYC they Nerf had a meeting with all of the Nerf global teams and they were all getting info at the same time etc. He said the problem likely stems from bad experiences with certain bloggers UT came up who leak unsubstantiated info early which they kind of dont appreciate. So take that for what you will... we know you like those Chinese sites.  ,Nerf,cikdgcy,2,t5_2qz7g

While you can chop up a RS and make it smaller than a Stryfe it still looks blocky.On the topic of a chopped RS I have more tacticool freedom as well. I have an extra tac rail as well as a place for a stock.The Stryfe is also noticeably lighter due to being less complex inside and that fits in with my whole speedmobility playstyle.It also comes down to my personal preference to have semi auto over full auto.

1712064,0,t1_cjuvhpw,You are forgetting the bolt carrier. Note where the bolt attachment lug is relative to the feed lips of the mag and where it needs to be. End result the only bolt mod involves the length of the halfpipe section of the feed guide but somehow the bolt and carrier need to be flipped upside down. Then the chamber needs to also be reversed and a new hole for the locking pin cut. Operating rod needs remounted on what is now the wrong side of the carrier.In the end what will be nastiest to deal with are the rail tolerances. I dont think the support surfaces on the carrier are symmetrical about the vertical plane so that will be part of the deal. Also the subframed PT area may not even be compatible with such a mod.In the end you may be better served by inverting the gun and addressing the grip situation externally.Or use flywheels instead. Stryfes have been converted with side magwells like a StenSterling or Rampage no reason one couldnt be right hand feed for whatever you want to do.,Nerf,cjuyuo0,3,t5_2qz7g

1813457,0,t1_ck7oc9l,Its all digital adjustment so theres no screw to adjust and no pot to wear out but yeah programming cycle length is a series of trips through a flow chart with enough return spring to push the bolt back to the home position.  Im sure that my settings arent the most optimal but a large number of people using the device and experimenting will find the ideal settings for a reciprocal action faster than a single user.As far as the cycle control goes I physically cut that lobe of the trigger lever off it shares the same switch as the trigger though the function is the same because it was causing the blaster to throw a fit if the cycle didnt end in perfectly the right spot.  I elected to use a stronger return spring to push the bolt back to the home position from where ever the cycle ended.Ive also set it to allow me six bursts before it forces a  second delay using the magazine size function.

2874745,0,t3_2t13h5,Unless you are changing up to Stefans I would say the gains are outweighed by the losses in this instance. Gains  FPS nice seal reduced plunger tube wear. Personal satisfaction.Losses Even if you breech for stock darts no more Koosh for you. Trickier loading and mag handling more potential for dart slicing. Brass requires very careful cutting and maintaining to stay reliable.  Polycarbonate is very brittle so a good chance of failure during assembly.If you breech it for Stefan darts you are well under the threshold for them to be hugely better than FVJ or Koosh plus you have to make them as well as taking yourself out of stock ammo games until OMW make their production ones if ever! You do gain cheaper and more stable ammunition. In a reverse plunger with only a kg mainspring its not going to be as stellar a choice as a fps plus air blaster.,Nerf,cnuuxjq,1,t5_2qz7g

3074432,0,t3_2vd7r7,Cylinder blasters are in an odd place at the moment as they were originally used for capacity and the ability to use tagger darts but the introduction of CS blasters meant that large cylinders became a bit redundant. As a result they became mainly used in pistol type blaster Strongarm hammershot etc but with Nerfs increased use of the smart AR system they can produce much sleeker blasters so theres not too much point in cylinders anymore. Cylinder blasters are probably going to see a lot of action in the Mega line due to nerf refusing to further develop a clipazine system for it and I can see it very much being a style choice especially for the zombie strike line but I dont think the elite line will get any more cylinder blasters any time soon.,Nerf,cognvev,2,t5_2qz7g

3704415,0,t1_cqeheou,Eh I dont really make a habit of scouring the internet for lots so Im not sure Id be of much help. The only time I ever bought anything Nerfrelated online it was just a lot of two blasters and all of ten bucks exchanged.As a rule of thumb though youre buying them all together so you ought to be getting a decent deal over buying them individually or else why bother right? Another tip if youre not looking for stuff to collect or mod you can safely ignore most of the older blasters because if anyone in your group has a newer Elite or later blaster theyre going to entirely outclass anyone stuck with the older stuff and its not going to be much fun. The only real exceptions to this are the Jolt and the Nightfinder those are the singleshot blasters that just load from the front and theyre more or less unchanged and manage to mostly keep up or more exotic stuff like the various airpowered blasters Magstrike AS etc.But in your circumstance Id go with what a couple others have said forget lots entirely just grab a dozen or two of the cheaper blastersOn the cheaper end you could grab a huge bunch of Triads and still have enough money left for lots of spare ammo the blasters are about ten bucks each a bit more at retail Amazon has them for a bit less. Theyve got three shots each are quick and easy to reload and pack one heck of a punch but theyre tiny little derringers so depending on what kind of battle this is going to be large open areas would not favor this blaster relative to say a closequarters indoor field it might not be the best bet.A bit of a step up would be the Strongarm its a couple dollars more but its a larger revolver style blaster that holds more shots before reloading and in my personal opinion it handles better and is far easier to prime for each shot. Youll probably find it at  bucks a pop pretty much anywhere that sells Nerf which still leaves plenty of money left over.A little more expensive  dollars retail is the Flipfury which is basically just a Strongarm with twice the shots. If you think theyll need the extra firepower it might be worth the extra couple bucks.Also even if you can afford to increase your budget Id avoid any of the motorized stuff I saw the Stryfe get mentioned and it probably is the cheapest of the electric blasters out there. Theyre formidable but pretty much only when modded. Stock performance out of the box is disappointing at best and most if not all of them have their own little gremlins that you generally want to take care of the first time you crack them open for modding. Unless you or one of your reptiles is willing to put the time in to open them up and at the very least rewire them with AWG and use Lithium IMR cells instead of alkalines although it would be better to outright replace the motors and wire them up to run on battery packs. Long story short theyre probably more trouble than theyre worth for your situation on top of being a bit too pricey to get enough for your group to really kit themselves out.Big thing though whatever blaster you go with buy spare darts. If you have the time to wait for shipping then get some of the bulk lots on ebay make sure to use one of the sellers which has been verified here as a rule theyre both cheaper and more reliable than the stuff youll find in the official refill packs.,Nerf,cqej0w2,1,t5_2qz7g

3873255,0,t3_34se1a,If youre ruling out BoomCo and therefore the Rapid Madness with its  dart clip then the NStrike Raider has the largest single magazine a  dart drum and can be used in any other magfed NStrikeElite blaster.The Hailfire has the largest possible capacity of any magfed blaster but requires   dart mags. If you want the largest possible capacity then youd want a VulcanHavok Fire with multiple belts which if you disable the slip clutch and dont go too hard on the belt advancing mechanism i.e. dont try to drag the entire belt across the ground or hang it off a table whilst firing can hold multiples of  darts. The Dart Zone Scorpion is another beltfed option but AFAIK separate spare belts for those are even harder to come by than VulcanHavok Fire belts.,Nerf,cqxs8ns,9,t5_2qz7g

3915432,0,t1_cr2jvj5,To be honest I never knew Containment Crew actually sold things. I thought they just reviewed things. I think a lot of people who want to make things in my country at least may be intimidated to do so due to potential legal issues cue in the Americans love lawsuits stereotype...I mean legal action is justifiable if you feel exploited or robbed due to copyright claims or patent claims. Also its rather expensive for me at least but who am I to say anything Im just a somethingyear old trying to make it by my countrys socialcultural standards to buy proper equipment i.e. d printers proper tools manufacturing items. Maybe thats just me being the stereotypical pennypinching Yankee but I think a lot of people in my situation would understand that. OMW is awesome but we do need more diversity. The nation is also pretty big we have regional divides in the hobby West coast Northwest Midwest Northeast Southeast so I guess it depends on where youre based correlates to your hobby market. Its not a matter of a lack of innovation its a lack of advertisement lack of exposure and lack of reliability. I guess those are universal. What SlyDev Hobby Mods BritNerf and Blastersmiths do is phenomenal. We in the U.S. mainly have Orange Mod Works and DormLabs as our big brands and there are smaller sellers but theyre not on the grid or at least my grid due to pricing and sometimes communication. We have a lot of random commissioners over here and I guess a lot of modding is based on the cultural ideal of working hard for maximum reward and taking pride in your personal work that seems quite prominent in my country. I cant really explain precisely why were lacking but I can theorize the potential causes. I wouldnt say its cultural I think it has roots in legality and lack of exposure. I guess Ill leave that up for other American Nerfers to decide.Edit Perhaps OP can be the first to make the move to develop something new. I know a lot of other Americans who go by the philosophy if it aint broke dont fix it but seriously innovation although sometimes risky investmentwise can make a huge difference and cause change. Hobbies are the perfect platform to take such risks. Id do it if I had the equipment and time but unfortunately my field is quite demanding. I wouldnt say we dont have anything new we just sometimes dont want to change old models due to potential loss of income. I feel like Im in an economics class right now lol. ,Nerf,cr2lf96,3,t5_2qz7g

You should wear protective gear if for no other reason than to be a good role model for newyoung and impressionable skaters.  As far as wrist guards causing arm fractures WAT?  I was a skater when I was younger probably from .  I took some NASTY falls on the vert and never got hospitalized because I wore protection.  I fractured my left wrist and broke my right arm... twice.  Know when those happened?  When I was screwing around with my friends like this video and thought I didnt need protection.  Also I got a concussion from not wearing a helmet.  Keep on deluding yourself.  Just because youve been lucky doesnt mean its conclusive proof.  Dont justify not wearing protection.  Dont try to say its ok to not wear it.  It is your choice but you damn well better acknowledge that you take a risk when doing so.  Trying to tell people youre so good that you can fall without hurting yourself is delusional and tells others that its ok if they decide not to wear protection.  Thats their decision and you shouldnt try and convince anyone that what youre doing is ok.  Also not wearing protection when you practice is a GREAT way to suck when youre trying to perform with protection on.  Get used to riding with guards on and you wont suck when you wear them.  ,Nerf,crb9vnu,3,t5_2qz7g
4004492,0,t3_36c6l4,With motors theres more to it than just voltage you also have to consider current. Current is what carries electical charge around the circuit and voltage is the driving force behind it. Essentially motor speed depends on voltage and the amount of torque the motor generates dpends on the current. At a given voltage and speed each motor will demand a certain amount of current. At full speed when the motor is under no load itll be drawing almost no current and when stalled when the motor is under so much load it cant spin itll be drawing a lot of current. This is becasue motors also act like generators so when they spin quickly they also start generating electricity but in the opposite direction to the battery this is called back EMF dont worry about it too much just remember that full speed and no load  low current demand and low torque whilst low speed with high load  high current demand and high torque. The motor will therefore demand more current when under load i.e. during firing in Nerf blasters and will generate more torque to counteract the load.If you fit a battery with a lower maximum discharge rate current than the motors demand i.e. Trustfires with decent fk motors then the batteries voltage will sag to compensate and you not only wont have enough torque to sustain your rate of fire youll also find your motors spin slower and dart velocity will reduce. This means that a lower voltage higher discharge battery can perform better than a higher voltage lower discharge one. This is why people tend to use LiPo packs as opposed to Trustfires or alkaline cellsbatteries.On batteries there are a few things to look for. Obviously voltage is one which is usually rated by cell number. A S LiPo is a Lithium polymer battery with  cells. With LiPo each cell is around .V nominal it will be slightly higher more like .V after a full charge and will drop below that after use and with LiFePO eac cell is around .V nominal.The capacity tells you how long a battery will last on one charge under a certain load and is measured in Ah Amp hours or mAh milliamp hours. This is how many Amps or milliamps the battery can supply for one hour and is generally scalable if you stay within the maximum discharge rate of the battery i.e discharging at C will halve your battery life discharging at C will quarter it and so on. C rating is a measure of current with respect to battery capacity. If you had a mAh pack and discharged it at C that would be mA A becasue . If you had a mAh pack and discharged it at C that would be mA .A becasue . A pack will usually come with two C ratings maximum continuous and maximum burst. Maximum continuous is the C rate that the battery can supply continuously whereas maximum burst is the C rate a battery can supply for a very short period of time usually a few seconds. In general at least within the same type of battery chemistry a physically larger battery will have a higher voltage andor a higher discharge rate. This is why if your blaster is meant to be powered by  D cell alkalines using  AAs is a bad idea. Its also why V PP alkaline batteries are terrible theyre usually just  AAAA cells wired together in series.When batteries or motors are in series they are wired up one after another with batteries this is with the positive terminal of one cell connected to the negative terminal of the previous cell. Each component receives part of the total voltage but all of the total current in the circuit. When in parallel they are wired up next to each other with batteries this is with the positive terminal of each cell connected together and the negative terminal of each cell connected together. Each component receive the same voltage but shares the total current between them. When in parallel motors will spin faster and draw more current than when in series so you need to add up the maximum motor currents at your running voltage to work out the discharge rate you need from your battery.,Nerf,crcqrhj,2,t5_2qz7g

4065651,0,t1_crjkfvq,It might sound counterintuitive but itd actually reduce the pressure. Its not the same as compressing static air in a cylinder. What happens is the air speeds up to compensate as it travels through the smaller gap and increased velocity means reduced pressure. It also increases frictional pipe losses so when the air enters the larger diameter barrel behind the dart it doesnt revert back to the pressure you would have had with a straight borethrough. The fact that the expansion and contraction are sudden would also add to the losses.This image illustrates it quite well. The fluid in the u bend of the manometer is being forced from the region of higher pressure the larger diameter side to the region of lower pressure the smaller diameter side.,Nerf,crjpo6r,2,t5_2qz7g

5554449,0,t3_3r7kl9,In short no. Most Nerf blaster models are designed for ages  and up which is twice as old as your son. Some recent models Star Wars for example have been rated at  and up but kids grow a lot in two years so thats still not what Id recommend. Older BOOMco models were also rated at  and up and often had smaller handles but these were still pretty powerful for a  year old. If the above sounds preachy or isnt the answer you wanted to hear then I apologize. But being the adults in the room Im sure you can agree we need to be thinking about safety even if the kids themselves wont.

I really do.But dont you think its a bit of a double standard that youre saying that fortune favours the prepared but being prepared doesnt seem to include reading the game rules before turning up to an event? So you think its reasonable for everyone one of the  mostly public nonnerfers to have to spend the time getting into the whole nerf modding scene. Sourcing parts developing new skills in internal modifications soldering buying new batteries and spending the time to mod their blasters... and if they dont.. well TOUGH because they should have been prepared.. its an ARMS RACE!But reading the rules of an event before turning up with a heavily modded blaster is somehow an unreasonable level of preparedness to expect? Modding nerf guns is hugely enjoyable I get it. I love my modded blasters as well and id love to use them in the game.

6106840,0,t3_3z35g7,gtEDIT I meant Stockade.Clarification Barricade and Stockade are variants of the same gun. One has yellow NStrike Gear Up and Sonic schemes has serrated flywheels gapped for micro darts and has a cage that uses .mm flat can motors with Standard Motor Co FNA coming stock. The other is Elite blue scheme has standard Gen  Hasbro sized flywheels yielding the standard . cal compatible gap and a cage that takes mm round motors and comes with a pancake motor that is not known for reliability.gtBut every time I see the Barricade mentioned on here people dismiss it as a parts gun to get some pieces out of for the Stryfe then sell. Am I missing something here?EDIT I meant Stockade.That is in fact the Barricade and what you pull are the motors.gtAm I missing something here?I was around for the launch and popularity of the Barricade. I used it at one point back then and I am familiar with its problems.Hard issues The trigger pull is satisfyingly solid but long and indefinite as to where the round actually flies and not suited to rapid fire or accuracy while encouraging shortstroking. The rotation system is flexible and can cause a jam or misfire under certain conditions. The mag arguable a mag not a cylinder doesnt hold darts tightly. Certain foams worn foam and darts left in place for hours can slip forward and be lost or cause a jam. The exposure of dart tips does not help. This virtually kills the viability for sidearm purposes. The overall packaging is very chunky and awkward. Would you carry a  inch thick pistol? I wouldnt.Soft issues Crappy motors on the stockade. Outdated micro type flywheels on the barricade. Stock the motors turn on as soon as the safety is turned off so people either go around draining their battery wearing their motors and making noise or they get pwned in a surprise attack. You basically need to install a rev button in the grip.And finally it holds  shots which is low and cant be reloaded quickly. You can do about as well at topping off with a magfed and one  round mag as you can with one of these yet you can carry additional mags and sidestep the whole issue.Its just an obsolete concept really. If you want a scavenge system look into the Swarmfire you can have double the capacity way more reliability ROF and response and full auto in roughly the same package.,Nerf,cyjsa50,1,t5_2qz7g

Id replace the compression magtube spring with a constantforce spring the tape in a tape measure is a constantforce spring but otherwise youd be good to go.If you do need a breech youre going to have a point of possible jamming.

Theres a single web in the TS that fits almost perfectly in behind the RS flywheel cage that sets up the whole alignment. The only real issue then is the taper in the TSs body which means the RS pusherbox wont fit without trimming something.

With the stock breech without AR its always a loud pop and the darts flies significantly straighter and harder. No FPS or data but it looks that way to me.

6752001,0,t3_486e9h,Short version adviceDo the build normally and properly. Rewire with correct wire gage install properly rated switches etc. and use the correct battery for the application which is certainly without exception a pack of some type. If you run into trouble with safety regulations THEN you can cross that bridge.Its a flywheel gun. The critical velocity is FIXED and out of your hands barring aftermarket flywheels and the like. If you get it set up normally supercritical and it shoots too hot for the game rules you can either run it subcriticaland accept the consequences with a lower VOLTAGE battery or lower kv motors or combination or you can not use itfind a game that is less lame.Using stock wiring and loose IMR cells in an alkaleak holder will not do anything different than a lipo except make the motor terminal voltage sag much worse under load and thus chop the top off the motor torque curve.

It is proven safe by its common use in HvZ and similar environments and is accessible enough as a competitive meta if you are new and go buy a fps off the shelf Nerf or Buzzbee product or the like.gtfriendly to the casual player without excluding reasonable and safe mods.Superstock is such.gtAs we dont have access to a chrono the general rule was that darts could sting at close range but not cause bruising or welts.KED thresholds for causing welts are extremely variable like all pain test measures.gtAdditionally we do require eye protection for all participants.Do not worry then. You have safety covered as long as you run superstock.gtI would like to go further and actually list some examples of allowed and disallowed modsblasters.Just be sure you are giving examples and not making rules. Banning technologies or parts is a nono because it is not objective and makes assumptions that X must always result in Y when this is not the case. What matters is what energy comes out the sharp end of what players bring to your war and whether it is safe. Either is or isnt. Aside from looking over the blaster to ensure it is mechanically safe no PVC for gas pressure no exposed LiPo batteries no junkfire batteries no sharp stabby bits like brass barrels sticking out and the like the rules should treat the gun as a black box.

7687393,0,t1_d3fz03v, in each tube  tubular magazines.  I didnt fire it today but this is how I remember it working after poking around on the inside.  When you move the pump grip forwards from the rearmost position three triangular pushers pop into the slot in the bottom magazine from the bracket underneath the cylinder just above the pump grip and then the triple pusher assembly slides forward with the pump grip acting against a dartpushing slider set into the groove of each magazine visible at the rear of the magazine cylinder in the picture pushing the dart into the flywheels.  The slider advances just enough to be acted upon by the next pusher upon a complete rotation of the cylinder.  The slider pushers are then automatically retracted.  At this point the cylinder may be spun freely for ease of reloading.  Moving the pump grip backwards rotates the cylinder of magazines.  One dart is fired per magazine until the blaster is empty.  The stock activation switch is set in that gray ramp up on top of the blaster but I relocated it to the trigger area because that is just a silly place for an on switch.  All in all it is a very strange way of firing darts but also fascinating.,Nerf,d3g0b8x,3,t5_2qz7g

The Vulcans chain feeding mechanism can only handle so much weight at roughly  ammo belts linked together  if youre lucky before the mechanism fails and needs repair. The bright side is that repair is usually as simple as realigning the belt but that time could mean life or death in a Nerf war.Maybe one day Ill attempt to make the Vulcan LMG work with higher capacity ammo belts than  or  but that day may not be for a few more months yet.,Nerf,d3iknty,5,t5_2qz7g

7971363,0,t1_d4byfaz,gt A .v F capacitor is  bucks from mouser. One or two of those in the circuit would give more than enough starting current for any motor. Also cuts the initial strain on the battery.Thats a supercap not really suited to this task but rather to being a power source in itself if the linear discharge curve can be overcome or dodged somehow. farads is  times what I use to spotweld battery packs. Anything near ONE farad would be massive overkill as an inrush snubber. You could probably calculate the required capacitance to keep voltage sag below the target  on motor startup with say Rhinos and gutless cells and I guarantee you it would be a few somewhat beefy normal not super electrolytics no larger than a small battery pack.Supers have a high ESR for their capacitance closer to that of a battery than a normal cap. The big ones can source massive currents because they have huge capacitances.Also note pluggingswitching a battery directly into a cap bank is initially equivalent to plugging a battery into a short circuit. If that was a F cap bank that current would continue much longer than a little momentary spark as when plugging in a RC ESC with caps on the input and would damage or destroy the battery if it was a lipo.,Nerf,d4c21nf,6,t5_2qz7g

Got it today and it shot reasonably although performance was REALLY unreliable. Opened it up to double spring it and reinforce the rotation mech.LO AND BEHOLD an unholy mess of locks and gears. The first bad sign is the gear train that primes the blaster prone to breaking under higher spring force Id suppose. I put in a Tek spring inside the stock one and ran into a big problem the zoomed in piece that primes the blaster is VERY flimsy. Any increase to spring force makes it slip out the box it fits into to pull the plunger for priming plunger wont catch and itll just slam back into the plunger tube. Reinforcing the rotation mech so it doesnt helicopter around made the whole thing lock up and rotation wouldnt happen because the weak return spring couldnt overcome the force of the peg that pops out to lock more like barely hold the claw cylinder thing in place.

Message I took from this is spacers are good but dont agonise over the exact size our actual variance was pretty small. I also got slightly better performance with the ACC spring than with any spacer combo and minimal downside other than cost. Dont know how it compares to the others tested its not massively stiffer than stock so still has a sensible actionIf you dont mind a much heavier thumb action for a small power upgrade double springing with a stock elite and stock hammershot spring works well IME and most of us have the spring spare. Worth it? Up to you its a taste thing not a better thing. Double springing is janky of course I shrinkwrapped the inner spring in an attempt to avoid interlacing which might help who knows but the end result was about a  increase over stockandspacer.,Nerf,d8ffeku,2,t5_2qz7g

9206678,0,t1_d8ip6pn,The problem is that the geometry of a nerf dart is totally and completely different to a football or a slug. Because they are so long the spin causes the darts to want to flat spin instead of axially spin. Its why . bullets that are not gt. inches long. Also bullets and footballs usually have roughly uniform density where as nerf dart have the mass concentrated very far forward which exacerbates this effect.I and working to try and develop a method of calculating the optimal twist rate for Nerf darts as a function of muzzle velocity etc etc. Its not as simple as spin it more for more accuracy. Real bullets that spin too fast are not stable. It may turn out that this spin too fast RPM for Nerf is RPM or very close to it. I just dont know,Nerf,d8j0k64,1,t5_2qz7g

9456678,0,t1_d9em1hj,gt an RC grade subC pack which can pull a A transient load safely and competentlySorry I should have said a V nimh pack that isnt  inches long. I often speak in absolutes when I dont really mean them. Im aware NiMh can scale to the requirements of high power Nerf motors since most racing packs are rated for C at kk mAh. The issue is fitting those in something that isnt a Vulcan or a Hyperfire. I was mostly trying to steer him away from those very small V NiMh packs you see on places like eBay. If he wants to build a battery stock and run wiring into it then yeah NiMH is an option but even with a expanded tray youd have to do some pretty creative wiring to cram and subC pack into a Stryfe shell.  I mean I guess its NiMh they arent going to explode he could just velcro it onto the side of the blaster and call it good. I have one of those Venom . packs in my Vulcan right now and it works quite well. I actually think NiMh has a distinct advantage over LiPo in providing voltages that fall between S and S. I just think its a bit of a niche because theres not a huge amount of info about it and the size requirements basically require you to be using one of a few specific blasters or be willing to build a battery stock. Also I think a lot of people will get confused about which packs to use since in theory youd imagine youd want Airsoft packs when you really want subC.,Nerf,d9ep968,1,t5_2qz7g
9458881,0,t3_5aahvc,I was playing with my little cousin and all the sudden darts started jamming. I had to keep on going as it was a life and death situation so I cleared it and kept going. Eventually I just heard a snap and a bunch of plastic shot out of the barrel. My guess is that these are the pieces that compress the air restrictors spring with the dart which explains why my darts hardly shoot and I can hear the air releasing slowly when I fire. I also was using the stage  OMW kit. Im not really asking for any help right now just retelling this ridiculous story. But Im guessing my next approach is to just take out the AR and pad the plunger head...! I never thought the day would come that Id have to take out the AR of an Elite Blaster.

The gearing for the pusher mech has a habit of nuking itself and the canted cage cannot take higher FPS without whirlybirding every dart.

10465533,0,t1_dcubibp,Its not just the connections but the multimeter itself although any relatively high resistance connections will also alter the measurement. Current is very difficult to measure directly  the most common way of doing it is by placing a resistor of known resistance in series with the load and measuring the voltage drop across that resistor using  VIR this is what multimeters tend to do. You may be able to see the problem here  if you use a resistor with too high a resistance for the current range youre trying to measure you induce a significant voltage drop across the resistor which in turn reduces the current draw you can work out iteratively the voltagecurrent it will settle at at a given load but you need to know the shunt resistance and motor specs beforehand. You get around this by carefully choosing using the resistor value so that the voltage drop induced is relatively insignificant at the sort of current draw youre expecting  if youre measuring across a large current range its quite possible that youll have to use a few different values of shunt resistor across the range. Some devices combat this by instead measuring the magnetic field around a wire to determine the current flowing through it but this brings its own problems. Whether or not this is the cause of the discrepancy itll depend on the individual multimeter and the setting selected whether its some other high resistance link in the chain or whether these motors simply arent what they say they are Im not sure but if the specs are correct and these motors are actually to spec then A stall implies that youre only getting about .V across the motor terminals at stall note that the voltage drop at noload will be less pronounced as the current demand is significantly reduced.,Nerf,dcudhxs,2,t5_2qz7g

In Vietnam US soldiers carried Nite Finders into battle to tag the Viet Cong and used them to great effect. They didnt hit store shelves until the NStrike line because Hasbro didnt feel it was their right to play God and give children an actual military grade blaster. Fortunatelty with the advent of combustion firearms in  textbooks are dirty liars the Nite Finder was dumbed down slightly for civilian use and hit store shelves as early as . The Firestrike is an upgraded incarnation and more similar to the actual military Nite Finders used in the war though sans dart storage because one shot from a Firestrike is enough to disable a modern Ford truck  giving three to the average person at the low price of . would be ridiculous.,Nerf,ddcpisn,4,t5_2qz7g

In a nutshell American superstock  Australian superstock  airsoft anywhere and I would suppose this is far less a function of replication as one of the very nature of playing a combat sport with a progressive mindset.

I can tell you from my caveman flywheel days that when you go too far you deflect the shafts and webs and start shooting profoundly to the side.

Instead of shooting darts it launches ballistic balls  which from here on out Ill refer to as BBs  from a flywheel that you manually rev up.  BBs are definitely more durable than Nerf darts and are about the size of a golf ball so you wont have to worry as much about your cat choking on it.  My cats used to play with BBs and the only damage they left were puncture marks from biting and scratching up the surface with their claws. Unfortunately Nerf doesnt make this ammo anymore and since your cat will be attacking them they wont last forever.  Some people have suggested using sponge golf balls as ammo but I havent tried it myself. This will meet some of the criteria you mentioned in the OP but the ammo isnt going to stick to surfaces and it might be hard to come by depending on where you live.

11306956,0,t1_dfdmgpu,Nah but Ive been known to give bad advice when it comes to flywheels.In my experience there is a component called a thermistor ? that breaks the circuit if its too hot in every flywheel blaster including Rival. So it really should be okay at least as far as destroying the blaster goes.

11341013,0,t1_dfgd4m6,Where the hell is this coming from?Seriously. Having played in a squad with Toruk I disagree with nearly everything you claim here especially the in person comments. While your beef with him is well noted this seems very out of place and disproportionate to the commentary previously typed. Toruk even admits above that this seems childish. Why must you continue to play the game this way? It seems this all started with the stupid flywheel vs springer debate back in the day but it seems you must continue this feud for time immemorial.  Toruk may be a little brusque online with his commentary and intolerant of those not willing to do their research he is not that in person. He is quiet and reserved but plays hard and honorable. In thunderdome we played against each other and there were no issues Rob didnt like flywheels too much in that setting but that is besides the point. He and I have always had a professional relationship though our contact online and he offers advice willingly to those who ask for it. That is correct he is different in person than online. That is merely a question of presence. Not everyone can be a youtuber and constantly refine their persona. Some people do not possess the power of public speaking. One on one is best fit for others. I wish this feud would end and that you two could go your separate ways instead of snipe from the comments sections. Its getting tiring. When you see a comment about the other just leave it. Its not hard. In fact its easier than what you currently do. GOD DAMN. Just my  cents. ,Nerf,dfhhfsp,7,t5_2qz7g

11602985,0,t3_65hv6k,Smart valve setups dont usually have more than  shots per unit the convoluted flow path would be causing a huge friction loss which would show up as the last dart having awful velocity. If you want more shots you dont want a smart valve gun.Im often one to pop into I wanna scavenge recommend a good scav gun threads and promote magfed and entering the field with enough ammo instead because usually that is advantageous but given the context I understand. I recommend the Swarmfire platform based on the RF observation  it is an AEG version of the RF more or less. Up to fpsrps and same easy reloading well suited to scavenging and very compact without the awful stock shell on it and of course no pumping nonsense. Search Swarmfire here I have build guides.A pneumatic SMG like a RF Rapidmadness Destiny etc. can approximate the Swarmfire IF it is run on a HPA rig though none of the existing ones now can easily do the velocity a Swarmfire can. For scavving you would want a revolving one like the RF not a clipfed one which are generally operated with preloaded clips in the same manner as magfed loadouts work and are difficult to load loose ammo on the fly.Flywheel isnt the best suited because there arent any parts that give critical velocity of fps and you have to run subcritical. The rotary mags may look appealing for scavving Barricade and Fearlessfire but they are janky. Using a conventional detachable box mag system to scavenge is easy with a minor port mod for easier toploading but random junk ammo can give magfeds indigestion.Battery life Not a problem if you use a real battery pack and size it properly. Also regards Barricade did... you have the stock setup where putting the safety off causes the flywheels to run constantly? Thats... Not viable... At all.,Nerf,dgb7hl0,3,t5_2qz7g

So this is going to need to be put on hold for a while.I will eventually post it actually completed and with a full build log but I am in a bit of a foul mood due to my own blunder.Mods include completely reworking the plunger mechanism using the internals of a Dualstrike adding a bunch of green LED strips to the internals and replacing the pathetic red light with a significantly better green torch.,Nerf,dgh45a5,6,t5_2qz7g

11683826,0,t3_66psj1,Acrylics require several coats and are best applied over a white primer Ive found. Someone mentioned enamel paints are a lot more pigmented and therefore usually require only one coat over any color paint. However enamel smells terrible and I havent yet found a way to keep it from ruining my brushes so I stick with the patient art of acrylic painting.Edit Also get the stuff in a bottle as the tube acrylics are too thick. And metallic acrylics are usually a bit goopier and require more patience. When youre painting over a coat of acrylic resist the temptation to brush a coat over wet paint even if it looks thinner than the surrounding area as this will only rub off the previous coat taking you a step backwards.
