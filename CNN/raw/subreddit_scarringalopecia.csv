6936319,0,t3_47j3dx,Hi do you have any recent updates on your condition? I have been diagnosed with FD not long ago but my biopsy and culture results came back negative  implying that my body for whatever reason is doing this to itself without the help of an outside pathogen. My case is very mild so far and is under control with the use of minocycline at the moment but Ive already lost a a little bit of hair before the treatment and Im terribly scared of it progressing over time. The whole thing just seems like an agonizing lifelong battle that Im ultimately going to lose when my scalp eventually looks like hamburger meat. Im not doing too well mentally.,scarringalopecia,d12k4ny,1,t5_2x4gd
