9629719,0,t3_5cx80g,The most records Ive ever picked up in a single trip to the thrift store mainly because of how good the condition was on most of these. Those s records were freshly donated looks as clean as if it I was picking out of a private collection. The Nilsson was in the worst shape with multiple seam splits and the Beatles have your usual ring and shelf wear. Theres a bent corner on the REM.Never was a fan of the Police but took the opportunity to get  of  studio albums and chart their progression. Should be fun. Most psyched for the REM and Fleetwood Mac records as well as the Beatles while Im taking chances on the new wave stuff.,BargainBinVinyl,da0276i,1,t5_3gb5g
