890397,0,t1_ch57raz,Honestly I prefer non social activities. Things that I can just wander around and look at on my own. I love touring wildlife sanctuaries or science museums. Our museums are pretty dull. Go once and theres not much left to see. I enjoy the parks but have pretty much explored them all already.Its a crime that I live right on beautiful Sabine lake and there is no place to go swimming.,Beaumont,ch5hq9z,0,t5_2u5vv

7637912,0,t1_d3acmz9,Interesting and good points.  Lack of vision and mismanagement.  Something I deal with often.  Its tough too because those people in charge arent spurred to leave by their lack of vision.  In a way the community almost enjoys that lack of vision... as if to turn a blind eye to the inevitable future.Im like you... I am not a hipster but there needs to be something that comes back to Beaumont.  Its hard to find hipsters that are also good at doing things.  lol ,Beaumont,d3adz00,3,t5_2u5vv
