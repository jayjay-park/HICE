I must mention that it is a bit too shiny for some people but ENBs have the perk of having an editing menu ingame so you can change anything you dislike.,Skyrim_Mods,cvmaqls,2,t5_2vymb

8769134,0,t3_505y8f,Just disable SkyRes perk module in your load order and theyll run side by side no problem.However if you want something a bit different load Duel Wildcat Imperious Disparity and Apocalypse Spells load Duel before Wildcat. This will keep the new weapon types and PerMa perks. While improving the combat AI stronger harder smarter  and adds a whole new injury layer to combat. Imperious adjusts racial skills and bonuses. Disparity increases racial and sexual differences. ,Skyrim_Mods,d71t0zp,2,t5_2vymb

9508177,0,t3_5anhab,A great idea to hold you over is to get Serana but just dont take her back to the castle at the beginning of Dawnguard. You can have her with you and one other follower until you finish that part of the quest. But you can spend a looooong time before you have to finish that quest so take your time and you can have  followers. You can even have  if you do the same thing for Barbas daedra quest. Just choose not to do it until this mod comes out. Hope I helped! D,Skyrim_Mods,d9l32wa,2,t5_2vymb

10279709,0,t1_dc8tuml,Yeah figured that bit out. I used the Bethesda catalog for most of the decent mods they had on their and NMM for everything else.The biggest thing is relearning how to manually install as well as do some ENB modding.

10553993,0,t3_5qyt8q,Something to consider is that maybe you reached the XB hardwares limit.  You do have quite a good number of mods. I know that if my game plays fine then I add a mod and it becomes unstable I know Ive hit my hardwares limit. I mod pc tho so sometimes there are tricks like a bash patch. Which combines somewhat arbitrary scripts into one script in order to lessen the load.  Im not sure what to do to get around it,Skyrim_Mods,dd4ewtj,1,t5_2vymb

11144278,0,t3_5z3ike,SE will be better one day when SKSE is ready and a whole bunch of mods are ported over for it but right now Oldrim is still much better imo. The only thing SSE beats Oldrim with atm is load times which are way faster. Maybe less crashes too. SE is bit btw and can use up more of your cores and RAM allowing the game to run a lot better. ,Skyrim_Mods,dev6xen,4,t5_2vymb
