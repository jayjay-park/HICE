I try to close the windows even yet I know of another older guy who lives alone once Ive seen him sitting in the courtyard outside with those headphones people wear at gun ranges  cracked me up!! Knowing well that was a HUGE EXAGGERATION. Thats for a gun going off in front of you and all the other people firing. not your neighbor closed Windows speaker set with ONE speaker that works and a small sub...  and he was on the opposite side of the courtyard not the chairs in front of our apartment ,myterribleneighbors,d3k20t4,1,t5_2wx1n

8820913,0,t1_d77x4wp,Yeah I hate that one tenant has affected literally everyone else in the building weve at all gotten several calls about the many complaints. If I werent already moving I would be moving now! I honestly considered moving into a motel or in with a friend temporarily but I have pets.In my last apartment the neighbors smoked and drank and shouted a lot right outside my only window. I didnt like it but they didnt change and I dealt with it. Id honestly prefer that to this lady!,myterribleneighbors,d785ign,1,t5_2wx1n

10859627,0,t1_ddzeqpe,Oh it would be a snowblower. They can shoot snow  feet. Doesnt work so well with wet heavy snow but if you live where there it is very cold and there is lots of dry snow they are great.  You need a large yard though or you blow snow to your neighbours. ,myterribleneighbors,de03e7f,1,t5_2wx1n
11665697,0,t1_dg4vhae,Yeah...I dont think talking will be the best approach with someone who simply just fires up a snowblower at  am. Hes either a Too mentally ill or stupid to be reasoned with or b Gives no fucks.Call the cops on his ass!,myterribleneighbors,dgiblk5,1,t5_2wx1n
