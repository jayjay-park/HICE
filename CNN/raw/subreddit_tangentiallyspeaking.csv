5114922,0,t1_cv1vf2z,Yeah long story but basically theyre hypervigilant about controlling everything and everyone. What pissed me off was when they asked me to pull the pivot slide from my talk which contained the best laugh line of the whole thing the day before my presentation. Theyd seen it several times already and approved it so pulling it then was a shitty thing to do. I had no time to reconfigure the talk. They have a history of pulling the rug out from people at the last minute. Google what they did to Sarah Silverman a few years ago for a much heavier example.,tangentiallyspeaking,cv2jfh2,3,t5_2yj8m

5151655,0,t3_3l2t62,Love this comment from the comments sectiongtIt is clear to not only expert Anthropologists Zoologists amp Evolutionary Biologists but everyday nature lovers that humans are linked to the ancestor we share with modern African apes although have diverged from on the evolutionary tree. After all our genetic blueprints reveal that the human genome shares  percent of our DNA with chimpanzees. It is mind blowing that the number of genetic differences between humans and chimps is ten times smaller than that between mice and rats. So while our cerebral cortex has developed with Superman leaps and bounds our earlier primate brain is responsible for aggression similar to that found in chimpanzee bands who are capable of organizing full out warfare against rivaling gangs over territorial dominance and sexual dominance thus guaranteeing their offspring will remain jungle top dogs so to speak. This aggression can still be found in powerful leaders across the world who have only advanced in terms of complexity of their natural weapons which now carry extraordinarily euphemistic terms like smart bomb friendly fire air campaigns enhanced interrogation cleansed or discriminate deterrence. Trump is obviously evolved from an apelike species.,tangentiallyspeaking,cv6ytyu,1,t5_2yj8m
5436427,0,t1_cw6598f,I havent yet travelled but I play tourist often on vacation.. I havent found the impetus yet to pull the trigger and go out there solo for an extended period of time. I dont know if it is fear of the unknown the strong connection I have with my family or the anxiety of not keeping myself on track on what track? I dont know either.And yes the community I find here is priceless!,tangentiallyspeaking,cw6k3au,1,t5_2yj8m
5442473,0,t1_cw793u1,Ya I think Buddhist ideas of happiness are incomplete. On some level buddhism seems in conflict with the biological reality of being a human being. I dont think were programmed to experience contentment from merely sitting under a tree and closing our eyes. I mean that works great for some people but our brains are wired to release chemicals that reward us for exercising forging connections with other human beings fucking eating etc. We must engage in the physical world to stimulate pleasant feelings.I think modern mans greatest barrier to happiness is finding fulfillment and joy at work. The mere act of survival used to be challenging and stimulating enough to maintain our mental health. We had to hunt which satisfied the need for exercise and social relation. We were driven by the fear of starvation and death from predators lending our lives intense purpose.Now that weve forgotten how to feed ourselves we need money to survive or you could join a commune but Im speaking to the majority here. To acquire this resource we have to either get a job work for a company or create one artist entrepreneur etc. Most of us fall into the get a job category. So most of us are spending the majority of our waking hours engaged in tasks we dont really care about. Were all doing mundane repetitive bullshit to make money for a soulless corporation. Its not that we dont meditate enough or that weve lost our spiritual connection to the land. I think the conventional lifestyle thats jammed down our throats is by default not conducive to happiness. It falls so far below our conditioned level of stimulus it barely even registers.This is really long winded but I guess what Im saying is a modern philosophy of happiness should be about finding a sane way to live in a world that demands you calm down shutup and dedicate your life to work. A world in which you measure your success by climbing the social ladder and buying houses and having kids and doing all these things that keep you chained to one place,tangentiallyspeaking,cw7buag,3,t5_2yj8m

7814850,0,t3_4mbk3l,While think that simulation theory of plausible. And we will reach it. The rate at which we get there doesnt really account for much in terms of whether we are in the simulation. VR will continue to grow as long as there is money to be made.  I guess the question is can we create a simulation of a sensation in the brain. Of we can create Neurosignals of the small of lavender than we can add that to VR. As long as you can stick wires in your brain. And then a wireless chip etc.  However it seems his argument boils down to  we will be able to make VR so we must be in one. I dont think that being able to make a realistic VR world means we are in one. Surely by the same tocken aliens exist because there are billions? Of other earth like planets.  I just dont see how making augmented reality ensures simulation theory.,tangentiallyspeaking,d3ugbwo,2,t5_2yj8m

11117325,0,t1_des140t,I dont think that exploring space and becoming an enlightened species are mutually exclusive at all. Human population is at  billion and counting. Its not sustainable. We either have a massive global die off probably  poor people or we GTFO. The modern environmental movement was given a big boost by the space program and the famous image of the big blue marble. Getting more people out into space is going to bring the finite precious beauty of earth into clear relief and will likely give us the tools to live much more efficiently. ,tangentiallyspeaking,des51gs,1,t5_2yj8m
