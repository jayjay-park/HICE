9303173,0,t3_57u5hq,We can do it! D I dont know if this time is going to be different or not to be fair. But I know taking part in challenges like these make it easier to be accountable than without. So with that in mind Im here to form healthier habits and to hopefully change my mindset for the better. Initially I want to change my relationship with food so that its not a reward or something to look forward to so to speak but fuel for me. Currently nowhere near that mindset yet but Im hoping to get there. Once my eating habits have changed for the better and remain consistent I want to then shift the focus on to my fitness combined with my new healthier eating habits. I have little to no support network at home and rarely partake in discussions on here too but everyone is so supportive and even reading through the posts and comments gives me warm fuzzies. So thats why Im here. ,TeamConstellation,d8v8tcn,6,t5_3gvf4
