However this is ASTMcompliant biodiesel not waste vegetable oil conversion. The common rail TDI was not designed to run on waste vegetable oil and absolutely does not tolerate it.Knowing what youve told us heres what I know from being a regular on TDIClub  seized engines leaving me on the rd engine in the car  did you use VW . oil? was your fuel way too thick? the HPFP is driven by the timing belt so if the HPFP seizes due to bad fuel it might affect the timing system and its an interference engine. Blown HPHF  Bad fuel. Your car would have the fully revised HPFP and is not one that is known to experience a high rate of failure for reasons other than bad fuel. The HPFP does not tolerate even slightly out of spec fuel. Do you have lab tests of your biodiesel to show that it is in spec? Because if not Im going to assume its out of spec. Ruined fuel rail  This doesnt count as its related to the HPFP failure. Blown turbo feed line  these sometimes go bad and VW has been good about covering them even out of warranty. but it could be caused by improper oil i.e. not VW . or excess oil dilution which would happen if your fuel is out of spec Broken AC compressor  this happened to me its actually a valve that fails. it has recently become available as an individual part but originally you had to replace the compressor to replace the valve. the valve is like . Destroyed DPFexhaust system  this is a fuel quality problem. any amount of Biodiesel affects the function of the DPF because it does not burn at the same temperature as petroleum Diesel. Many people run B in CR TDIs but these people also have VCDS and force a purge every so often. Multiple cases of electrics failing resulting in windows not being able to be controlled.

5146054,1,t1_cv69z5d,Eh fair enough. I dont understand why youre so angry over it but thats your problem to deal with.I just have a fair bit of experience inside these engines. When you advance the injection event you get increased PCPs efficiency and NOX. When you retard the injection event you decrease PCPs efficiency and NOX. You also increase EGTs which means shorter turbo life. But you probably already knew that.And I know the differences between whats offered in Europe and whats offered here. Piston ring land locations leading to lower hydrocarbons and destroyed engines. Do you know how many BTUs it takes to produce an engine block? Do you know the cost of running a vast majority of cars in the U.S. on less efficient gasoline as compared to diesel? Of course you do this is all an open and shut case for you.I realize it was UWV that found the issue I was not aware that they were also the entity setting NOX emissions standards. I had thought that the EPA was doing that which is why I questioned their omniscience and absolute authority. You can see how Animas isnt a straw man from that perspective. As an aside I wonder if you thought people in the EPA dont also have advanced degrees in the subject matter? I suppose credentials arent at issue but rather political issues clouding the situationMy only point is that VW did this for a reason and Ive yet to see the outcry in progressive Europe. If it was simply to be evil then yeah thats on them and its terrible. If on the other hand the engineers built the system this way as a lesser of two evils laws be damned then I think the reaction here has been idiotic.  billion for some nox compared to multiple deaths due to GMs incompetence in airbags getting  billion.

The amount of money being dumped into EPA policies and federal circle jerks is better spent on engineering better hulls for barges to cut through water more efficiently. More aerodynamic locomotive designs and truck designs. And better spent of better methods of agriculture and industry. Like just based on the amount of dick sucking you do thinking the EPA has done anything relatively good in the last years is a decent view on your profession choice. You probably are not an engineer in any field so these abstract topics are probably tough for you to swallow. Your truck from  is drawing more pollution than any current generation VW.This article is from   is the starting year for this scandal for TDI common rail vehicles. If you think these barges have started polluting any less then in  that is a wrong assumption. Essentially if you read the first couple of paragraphs of the EPA link you showed. All they have done is put forth a commercial model for SELLING of low sulfur fuel there is no mandate just yet for low sulfur engines for water freight. Just incentive.Back to your first remark.gt So what would you say a reasonable amount of crippling childhood asthma is?So what would you say is a reasonable chemical to suppress and what would have the greatest impact? Because SOx is just as bad as NOx. And I have proven to you that  barge indeed produced x more emissions than the  million cars in question. How about CO which other countries are more worried about combating. Such as China and has shown actual results in lowering these factors by hitting big bussiness and not something as simple as passenger cars and everyday consumers. VW scandal are allegations now without a full investigation you seem to think that these  million cars have produced  million cars worth of emissions since  factoring in production each year. You do realize that the only time these emissions occur is when the engine is pushed into a leaner state below the stoic value of Diesel. Idling vehicles produce little to no NOx NOx is a product of heavy boost pressure dumping in extra air into the chamber and timing being advanced for injection. This happens at very heavy levels of load and very high RPMs. Soccer moms in there  sportswagens arent even hitting these engine limits by a long shot. EPA has only passed policies that have not been adopted in full yet just like any other government policy. It may pass a mandate but it is not in full effect until a cooldown period with a required date. Case point something as simple as identification cards for all Federal employees is a mandate by FIPS  have still not been integrated in the full Federal sphere. Diesel is heavily taxed more than regular fuels lobby ... big surprise EPA targeting the passenger car diesel sector ... big surprise The decrease in NOx is due to regulations against the large infrastructure and bigger engines such as transport and freight. You seem really interested in this whole emissions thing just because it is a circle jerk right now. But we all know you give  fucks about it.

They have to do something similar for consumers because the consumers are holding the vast majority of TDIs that are likely to come on the market in the next  years while the recall is being processed.  The customer package will likely include the same guarantees as they are offering dealers with a sweetener on top of it.,tdi,cwjuita,2,t5_2rk6a

6088120,0,t1_cyhlci1,Sure we have lots of vehicles in the family even some are at my house as I have garage space for  vehicles. My sister and brother in law have extra vehicles. BMW M and Mercedes SL as at this time of year they drive their Tundra and Jeep. Neither do much good in the snow. At my house there is my fathers corvette and my corvette. Again no good in the snow. My Fatherinlaw has his  GMC  Crew Cab Long Box stored in my pole barn as they are in FL for the winter. While it is wd err wd? The thing is a PITA to drive as it takes  parking spots. Not to mention that dual rear tires in snow are pretty sucky. Too much flotation and not enough weight in the back end with oodles of torque from the big Duramax. While he would let me drive it in a pinch it only has about  miles on it and he would rather not have it in the salt and snow. Where it is parked is kind of a pain to get to as well in the winter. I can get it out but the hill can get icy this time of year so tough to get it back in storage.I really dont need this though. I have my beater Avalanche that I could drive. I dont drive the Jetta much in the summer. It sits more than it is driven so they can have it for a month. This is the time of year I put the most miles on the car. It is really a winter car for when I am not on my motorcycle.  I was joking about the tractor.Really the two reasons I am trying to hold off is that body shops in MN are swamped this time of year. We just got hit with a pretty good snow fall and there are going to be lots of cars in the shop from fender benders. Busy body shops try and rush things through this time of year as everyone wants their vehicles back. The other reason is paint doesnt cure very well in cold temps. Sure they do the initial cure in the shop but it is best to keep the temps above F for a few weeks after painting for it to fully cure. This is coming from a buddy that works for M automotive paint division. He is the guy that goes around to all the body shops training their staff on how to use their products. He supplies the body shop that I am being referred to so their paint is being used on my car. I also activated my GW package and spent the dealer credit already. The CV joint replacement that I was in for ended up costing me  after the dealer credit was applied.,tdi,cyhmpuw,1,t5_2rk6a

6265971,0,t3_40xw12,You should start saving.  Dont start shopping yet.  If a buyback is announced the details probably wont be out for at least a few months.  Different people will be affected differently and it will depend on what rules they choose to follow and what your circumstances are.  For instance its possible that not all vehicles will be covered or that the value wont be enough to cover loans on some peoples cars.. and there will be people like me who arent really well situated to buy a new car right now who are extra screwed.  I guess if youre in one of those categories you should start saving for a new car now and worry about the shopping when the time comes close.That said whats the harm in looking around?  Just dont fall in love and dont rush into a new deal.  If you trade your car in now you might be missing out on a potentially better deal from the buyback and of course youll probably take a bigger loss than you need to but youd gain the certainty of not having to gamble on VWs decision.  Personally Im researching very casually to see what I might do instead.  It will really depend on a lot of factors.  I might just save side money for a few months and buy a beater for cash and be done with car loans for a while or maybe Ill get a new Subaru or even a gasoline Sportwagen.  I dont have enough information to make a decision.  Maybe the buyback will leave me with enough cash to buy a replacement car with the money.  Maybe it wont and Ill be left fighting for the right to keep my car.  Maybe therell be a mileage limit on the buyback and Ill be stuck.  Maybe the total worst case scenario will come true Im ineligible for a buyback and NY decides to ban TDIs from the road and Im left paying a loan on an undriveable unsellable car.  Maybe VW will offer great rebate and financing deals to make me want to buy another VW instead of a Subaru. Maybe other carmakers will offer sweet deals to snap up VW customers.  Maybe it will be cash for clunkers again and the deal will apply at any dealership.  Nobody knows.  Theres a world of possibilities and just not enough information to make a decision.  ,tdi,cz1vdes,1,t5_2rk6a

6366849,0,t1_czd6a80,gt Quit sitting here thinking u are going to use a car for  years rack miles on it and have a judge say u didnt get some value out of it. Your massacre of the English language notwithstanding...A judge isnt going to order it because there will be a negotiated settlement rather than a court order.As to the matter of a buyback at full purchase price you are right that for most customers that isnt a likely outcome.  However there is a California emissions warranty law that requires the manufacturer to refund the purchase price of the car if they cannot fix the emissions issue in an expedient fashion.  In fact one of the California law firms have filed separate class action suits against VW based on this specific law rather than the more general case of fraud or misrepresentation.  It is yet to be seen if VW will have to refund the purchase price for the cars covered by this law but based on this specific law there is a better than average chance of this being the required remediation for them.As to everybody else this is probably not a realistic option.  However as I said this will be a negotiated settlement and a buyback at full purchase price is a very reasonable starting point for negotiations.  If you look at what the various law firms have requested as remediation in their suits they start at a buyback.  Heres a list of possibilities from Hagens Bermangt What is the intended outcome?gt Hagens Berman will seek for each Class member the damages they incurred as a result of Volkswagens use and concealment of the use of a defeat device in the Affected Vehicles. Such damages may include the premium paid over the price of an equivalent vehicle with a gasoline engine the purchase price of the vehicle the cost of unused extended warranties the cost of excess fuel associated with a decrease in efficiency the cost of future repairs the loss in value of Affected Vehicles and the cost to remediate harm to the environment caused by the excess levels of pollutants released by Affected Vehicles.Even if its only for prescandal value for me thats almost k.  Theyre also pushing for VW to refund the TDI premium which in my case would be about .  Those are both very reasonable requests and thats before you get to any punitive damages for having defrauded me or causing me to pollute the environment at illegal levels for over . years.  Now were looking at easily k on a car that I paid about .k for.  I can take that money and go buy a Subaru or something and would be happy to do so.  But if VW is smart theyll try to turn this into a sales opportunity and offer us an extra incentive to go to a gaspowered VW.  What would that be?  If they offered me a k bonus then were pretty much at what I paid for the car when new at least if I apply it to towards a new VW which I wouldnt do.  So is that a buyback at full purchase price?  No.  But its pretty damn close to it.,tdi,czdc9z1,2,t5_2rk6a

6642174,0,t1_d06b2vf,Sportswagons and Jettas have independent rear suspensions and urea tanks in  same with Beatles.Its logical to assume that VW could not fit a urea tank in the Golf and retain an independent rear suspension.   Otherwise they would have offered it they did on every single other TDI model and the Golf is sold at a higher price than Jettas. The tank cannot intrude into the passenger compartment.  The Golf being a hatchback means the entire length of the car includes the passenger compartment.  The Beatle and Jetta have trunks which are separate from the passenger compartment Sportswagons have an extra foot or so of length behind the rear wheels to fit a tank.Numbers are hard to find.  The best I can find is this graph but it doesnt separate models.VW has been quoted in previous earnings reports that TDI models are  of their sales.  Cant say with certainty that that directly applies to Golfs.From the chart they seem to average about  MK Golfs per month.  Extending that over the  year run for  they sold about  MK Golfs.  If diesels make up  of the models that gives about  Golf TDIs that they have to buy back.So youre right it probably does include a lot more than just Golfs.,tdi,d06cwqe,1,t5_2rk6a

8109721,0,t1_d4re9vq,EDIT I am changing my opinion on keeping the car. I still feel its pointless to park it to get more money but worth it to keep driving it as long as possible. You benefit from zero depreciation based on the calendar and reduced depreciation based on the mileage. Im keeping mine for a while.FOREWORD I should not have just wasted an hour on this post but Im bored today. The very fact that my comment has a foreward is ridiculous.Assuming the buyback offer remains the same regardless of how long you wait to sell it other than the mileage credit of  per month... I made an excel spreadsheet with accompanying graph to determine the optimal time to sell the car back. This is based a rough estimated mileage Ill have October in  which is my assumed date that the buyback will begin. The graph I made assumes I will put  miles on it from October  onward as I wait out the clock and accrue mileage credit per month... My buyback offer amount will increase with each  miles of credit since they use bracket amounts in my case  is in the  miles bracket And each month I earn  miles of credit so I enter lower Adjusted Miles brackets about every  months of parking the Jetta.My starting buyback offer if I sold it in October  would be If I waited one month the extra  miles of credit would make no difference as Id still be in the same bracket.But If I waited  months Id get  since my adjusted mileage would enter a lower bracket  milesHere is the data I came up with which is specifically for my situation but roughly can give you an idea of what extra money youd earn by keeping your car parked for X number of months... Months | Extra Payout | Earned per month| | |  |  |  |  | || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || || |Graph Which shows a few key factors.... It shows that I get my biggest return waiting just long enough to reach the next lowest mileage bracket.    This is because I would be close enough to it to begin with that Id only need  months mileage credit to get me there. It shows that about every  months I reach a new bracket and my earnings make a jump then diminish each following month until I reach the next mileage bracket.    This tells me Id want to sell the car back right after reaching a new bracket because keeping it another month or so would not get me any extra cash anyway.. It shows a diminishing return on my waiting period. Its not siginificant but it is something to consider.    The most Id make per month if I parked it more than  months is only  per month. Is it worth storing a car for  years to earn an extra ? No Not to me. Id need the extra storage space Id have to have something else to drive in the meantime also so Id have to have extra cash upfront for that. But Id certainly be better off parking it just long enough to get into the next lowest mileage bracket if I was close enough to it. In my estimate here Id earn an extra  if I parked it for only  months which would be worth it for me. I do have a truck I can drive short term and a motorcycle if the weather cooperates. Of course I could plan ahead and park it NOW and take advantage of the good motorcycle weather which Ill probably do as much as possible anyway.,tdi,d4rlt6w,15,t5_2rk6a

In the US in some place they have bad quality diesel and on the long run that can hurt the HPFP . Even if you change the IC and HPFP and get DPFCATEGT  deleted youll run into high egts issues when flooring it because thats how the engine was designed making high egts for the DPF Regenerations.On a th of mile at the end I guarantee you you will hit the EGT limiter and you need to release the throttle or youll kill the engine. You need a bigger turbo like a gtb  or  vk to get thoses EGT dropped.Thats my next move on my Stage  Malone Jetta TDI.Check my video and the dyno sheet on the description .

Or you disagree that maybe we have a different take on fair vs generous? lt most likely  My poor example was Apples to Oranges.  I did say this didnt apply to a car and what I forgot to mention was usually the purchase to return time was less than a two days.  The VW situation lasting so long is a bit different.  I agree that the environmental impact is important and I never said otherwise.  Regarding what is fair or not...I certainly dont know.  Maybe it is fair.  But the deal stings.   VW makes their money selling new cars and quite frankly ss someone who bought new it stings that the numbers work out so favorably to people who bought used to such an extent theyre turning profits and people who bought new tend to be holding a bag of shit.  In my opinion and the world can disagree I do not feel their offer is fair or generous to people who bought new.  They could have valued the cars differently where new buyers could have walked away with something as well as used buyers.  I certainly wont return to VW nor will I ever speak positively about them or their cars.  They fucked me over.  Your mileage may vary  ,tdi,d6mh1y5,1,t5_2rk6a

8794417,0,t1_d74udln,Agreed.  I practically used to live in a family dealership.  Its all about finding out what number is important to you making that number the most appealing by jacking up everything else.Want a ton of money for your trade sorry bucko youre paying full price for the new car and a little extra on loan  aftermarket.  Want a good deal on the new car?  Sorry cant give you anything on your trade but youre getting this sweet deal on the new car.  Oh sorry you dont want the trade anymore cant sell you the new car at that price.Youre a payment guy?  month loan lower rate jack up the price.I used to be a finance guy but I never dealt with leases before and this scum sucking sales manager tried to spin me around on terminology on my first lease.  Tried to stick me for an extra  on what Id already agreed to buy somewhere else by saying I was confused about what was the total price .  I walked and he chased me begging to come back in.  When I went back in he tried to parade through all the sales peoples leases and show me how much more money they were paying then me.  I said are you fucking kidding me?  The dealership gives you a fat stack of cash to drive those cars.  Subtract that from the profit and lets see where it shakes out.  Started stammering some nonsense about all the free car washes I could get at the dealership being worth thousands of dollars.Dont ever think for a second that a dealership isnt rigged to fleece every last dollar they can out of your pocket.  Those places are cash machines that are one of the only places in the United States where everything is a negotiation.Those sales managers typically have decades experience negotiating everything.   of Americans dont have a sliver of comparative skill.

9437798,0,t3_59w6fp,. I already replaced my TDI. I am not driving the TDI to up the buyback amount. I am paying insurance on a car that is sitting in the driveway.

I am not looking forward to having to plow snow around the Jetta as it sits in the driveway.. Dont have a warranty on my  Jetta.While many of these are self inflicted because I chose to already replace it I did this because if I went new it was going to be very difficult to time a special order car to be delivered when the buyback happens. While I could have tried to find a new one on the dealer lot WRXs are not that common and they sell fast around here. I went used because I found one pretty much exactly like I would have ordered. It was my rd choice on color. Other than that exactly what I would have ordered. By going used it saved me K off the price of new.

How that failure was caused intentional or a bug is irrelevant.  The fact remains is that if VW hadnt been cheating and had been following the legal requirements this wouldnt have happened.The worse part about it is that every time theyve been caught theyve lied and denied and when given multiple chances to come clean they are still trying to keep secrets and still keep getting caught.

A little later I get a DEF WARNING that my car wont start in  miles. I take it in and they say it isnt under the extended warranty and the fix is .

10975866,0,t1_dec1k5w,Yes and definitely try it but its likely that the insurance company wont accept the VW buyback amount because its not the actual cash value of the car now.  I would show the the buyback offer from VW and ask them to buy the car at the price VW is offering you before restitution.  If you can get that you can still get the restitution from VW making it like you just turned your car in.  I just think based on my negotiations with insurance companies in the past youll have a tough time convincing them that the VW offer is the ACV.As others have said your better bet is probably to try and keep the salvaged vehicle and try and turn it in to VW.  If they reject it get a cut rate repair shop to do some cosmetic fixes and try again.,tdi,dec3yd4,1,t5_2rk6a

11104201,0,t1_deqj2mb,Depends on the case if you crashed it into a tree or something then its the terms of your insurance that applies mine says the cap the payout at the actual cash value the definition of that is something to argue but they say they do include depreciationbetterment weather you can get it to the VW is difficult though.If someone hit you and totaled your car and you are not at fault and can go through their insurance then none of the insurance policy applies and it falls into what a court would award you the court would generally award damages and it should be easy to prove that the VW amount was the actual damages done to you minus scrap value maybe. In that case it should be easy to get the insurance company to pay out that value.The other option is simply paying out of pocket to fix it the insurance is totaling it because the cost to repair it exceeds k or so. But you dont actually care if its completely repaired maybe you can dump k on repairs to the engine and then sell it back to VW or maybe its totaled and still drivable just drive it to VW! That could easily get you more money if you can manage to avoid a salvage title.,tdi,deqngzd,2,t5_2rk6a
