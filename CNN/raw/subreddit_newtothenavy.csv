Its hard to explain just how difficult it is but it made Navy bootcamp seem like a joke.  The only benefit of OCS is that you share a dorm room with a room mate and dont live in a squad bay.  Youre training to be a leader at OCS.  The course is designed to overwhelm you with things to do.  You can physically feel the stress when youre there.

2466385,0,t3_2nr5xh,Really depends on what you want out of the navy in general. If you think you might want to make a career out of it then nuke is a really and I mean really good deal for an enlisted person. If you think you are going to do six and out then and this is just my personal opinion it isnt worth it. To land any of the civilian jobs people often talk about typically RO at a civilian plant you generally need to have stood EWS or its surface equivalent for at least  years before getting out and that isnt going to happen during a six year contract. Maybe during an  year contract if you decide to STAR at your  year point but that would take some luck and good timing. In short my advice is the following if you think you might want to make a career out of the navy and believe you have what it takes to tough it out then go for it. It is a great program. If you know for a fact that you dont want to make it a career then choose a different rate. Sure you dont get the bonuses that nukes do but youll be happier in the long run.

Flu but Im actually kinda dependent on it at that point. But besides that if I were at the gym I could workout and not suffer any type of discomfort. Its only when I go extremely hard and long distance cardio when I feel some type of discomfort. If I were to train myself for a couple months I would be for sure able to run a mile and a half around  minutes. But I do use it on the daily right now because my doctor gave me direct orders to take it daily until I built up my cardio.My recent activity is more so focused on building and cutting muscle rather than cardio but Im probably gonna switch it to do more cardio than building. In high school I did Cross Country for one year  running  miles every day was pretty hard. But I got to the point where I couldnt run a mile but I built my up my endurance to run  miles. So I think if I worked on it I would be able to withstand some rough spots.  So boot camp was very soft?  miles seems like it would be the death of me but if I had to suck it up I would do so.

3280990,0,t3_2xpl11,gtI heard that first two days you have to stay awake a complete  hours in an uncomfortable positionYour wording implies that you were told that you wouldnt move for  hours this is both hilarious and ludicrous.  Youll be standing around doing fuck all yes but then youll be shuffled around to fill out forms pee in cups receive your uniform kit etc...all of which is separated by waiting in lines.  Youll spend most of the first  hours not actually DOING anything and no you wont be allowed to lay down or close your eyes or even lean on the wall if you happen to be standing near it bulkhead sorry and dont do that shit  thats good advice since in the fleet freshly painted surfaces arent necessarily indicated by anything so NOT leaning on stuff is a good way to keep your uniform you know clean and stuff but its fine  thousands of people do this every year and the overwhelming majority of us got through it fine.The whole point of RTC is to toughen you mentally and physically.

However once we had to alternate between standing at attention and parade rest  minutes for each for like  minutes. That sucked.gt What was the longest you had to sit cross legged on the floor?Unless you are a yeoman your main sitting position is on the deck. Youll sit in chairs during any of the classbased instruction as well as at chow but youll sit on the deck for everything else. I couldnt tell you the longest we sat cross legged but it was long... like hours.gt How bad did the barracks smell with  guys farting all night?I cant really smell that well but it didnt seem bad. Maybe after PT but they usually have us hygiene afterwards. Just get some clinical strength deodorant and youre golden.gt Given that the showers are only hot or cold how hot is hot?  Intolerable?  Like wow this is so hot fuck my shower today or just warm? You can adjust the temperature. Most of the showers work just fine and if they dont then tell your RDCs. Most people found the showers to be quite pleasant  if you didnt have to shower in under  minutes or less.gt Did you get any chance to talk with anyone casually?  Church while shitting etc?Of course. Theres a lot of down time. You just have to be smart about it and not try to get everyones life story at inappropriate times. Theres always after taps lights out church holiday routine on Sunday and other times as well.gt Are they seriously giving everyone tablets instead of books now?  If they are how useful did you find the tablet?  Or was it a giant headache to use software instead of a regular book?Those are only given to testtrial divisions. I spoke with a few recruits who had them and they said that they werent too bad. You had to turn them in at night to charge them. You couldnt do anything fun on it  like Facebook. They seemed to be more of a pain in the ass because if you forgot it somewhere youd get your ass dropped.There are also trial divisions that would wear sneakers instead of boots. They just looked weird.gt How many chances do you get to improve your run time?  I have been told that you get very few so trying to improve your run while in boot camp is a bad plan.You have a decent number of times where your divisional PT is cardiobased. There are also  PFAs you will do at RTC but only the last one counts towards graduation. If you cant get your run time to a manageable level after the final PFA they will put you with a division that does PT all the time in order to ensure you can graduate on time. If you still cant pass by the time you were supposed to have graduated then you just continue the same process for a bit until you do pass.gt What was the worstleast favorite point in your training?Worst Pdays until Marlinespike sucked. It was just boring. Marlinespike isnt until your th week of training. You learn how to cast off and dock a shipboat. This marks the point when your education switches from didactic to handson training. gt What was your favorite part of your training?The gas chamber. It was exactly what I expected it to be but getting the chance to see everyone elses reaction was great. It isnt that bad. I thought it smelled like burnt hair that made it difficult to breathe or open my eyes. In all honesty it isnt as bad as people make it out to be. As a whole pretty much everything done during the firefighter training was a good time.Also captains cup was fun. Thats when all of the divisions in your graduating class get together at the main gym freedom hall and do a bunch of cool games and competitions. gt Are you proud of the changes you see in yourself now from before and after RTC?Im still me except now I wear the uniform.

Whereas a CTR or CTI is focused on collecting recording and analyzing SIGINT an IS is focused on taking the finalized SIGINT reporting and tying it to IMINT HUMINT OSINT etc. We do generally make briefs for the higher ups that focus on finalized intelligence which does include some PowerPoint time haha.

5503822,0,t1_cwezws6,Not really for me. Its not that its easy exactly either but academically its not too challenging. What is challenging is all the BS you have to put up. Forced study hours and depending on how well you memorize it can be  hours a week at least  hours a day that come after a full day of school. Most people get kicked out for being stupid in their personal lives drinking and driving and things like that.And then you get to prototype where its a mix of academics and actually having to act like a real person that can talk to people to get checkouts for your qualification. That part is largely up to you but some people couldnt just... talk to people and ended up getting too far behind and dropping out.Nuke life in general isnt easy and most nonnukes resent nukes because of the propay or the general weirdness associated with nukes.My advice? Become a surface mechanic and then choose to be an ELT. Engineering laboratory technicians have the best jobhours of any Nuke rate great advancement and the highest bonuses usually. You can ask any Nuke and theyll tell you the same.If you want the challenge of being on a submarine still go ELT. ,newtothenavy,cwf5xtg,1,t5_2v1a6

5723419,0,t3_3tihae,Hey there to answer your questionswith AM being aviation do you really feel like your in the Navy like your actually a sailor or just like your in separate world You certainly feel like youre in the Navy but it is a different part of the Navy. I think most aviation rates are this way. I certainly think its great as you can end up on a ship or a squadron that never sees a ship. In my opinion its especially great because you have more options for orders.secondly anyone care to just give me a bit of walk through of what AM life is like or just being an Airman in the Navy It depends on if youre I level or O level but either way youre waking up and working on the structure of the aircraft in some regard. Right now I work in paint and corrosion which I think is especially interesting because all of this knowledge can transfer over to painting cars if I were ever so inclined. I dont want to paint cars for a living but just having the skill in my tool box feels good.I pretty much take parts of the aircraft that are corroded rid them of said corrosion then paint them accordingly. Another interesting aspect of the AM rate is how many facets there are to it. You can work in a tire shop corrosionpaint shop you can work the line check and so on and so forth. Im still rather new and have yet to experience even half of what is in store. But I came into the rate pretty clueless and became pleasantly surprised with what can be learned and what the work is like. Edit If I can give additional advice boot camp isnt much like the actual Navy. Its a great place to better yourself physically and become a little more disciplined but dont let it get you down if it does at all. Youre leaving the same time of the year I did so its going to be really really cold. A school will be a lot more lax and youll be happy to arrive in Pensacola FL after the ice cold winter. Dont let the holidays bum you out at boot camp. I hated being there for Christmas and Thanksgiving but its not too bad. Just focus on the events of boot camp. Every week you should be doing at least one interesting evolution like pistol qualification swim qualification and so on. So look forward to things like that and it will help pass the time. If youre going in as an E or E try to get a position of responsibility with your division and do as well as you can some times you can get a meritorious promotion that way. ,newtothenavy,cx6jozr,2,t5_2v1a6

Despite the hours I still got plenty of shore time saw and did some cool stuff and made friends that I still have today and probably will for a long time.If you have any interest in engineering or power generation then it definitely has its rewards. But you do have to love the work so you can focus on that when and if the times get tough. And when you get out youll have a leg up on a lot of other people.,newtothenavy,cxj241e,1,t5_2v1a6

6769569,0,t1_d0jhsj7,How chits work and the limitation set upon you while at school will be explained when you indoc at the barracks and the schoolhouse.Vehicle policies very by A school by base and by year. Im not sure about the current policy regarding ET and FC A school students and their vehicles on Naval Station Great Lakes. It seems to be ever changing.Over the years Ive seen a variety of policies.From student vehicles being fine but if you live in the barracks you need to register for a parking space in student parking. When all parking spaces are full no on base passes are issued. Those living with their family off base or in government housing are allowed to drive on base and park in student parking near the schoolhouse. To no student vehicles on base what so ever. However this leads to some students in the barracks buying beaters and parking them a couple blocks outside of base where the cars tend to get broken in to or vandalized. Sometimes those living off base are allowed to park on base. If not then usually a family member will drop them off at the barracks each morning to march to the schoolhouse.Youll be there long enough to see some policies change. Mostly because they want to treat ET and FC A schools like they are a week or two weeks long. It isnt until the ET and FC A school students start dropping chits like crazy that they realize ET and FC A school are unique in that they are almost a year long.SEA STORY One of my fellow students joined late in life. Because of the length of A school he was able to get government housing and live there with his family instead of in the barracks. The schoolhouses at Great Lakes decided to unify the barracks and make one policy that would cover all barracks. Out phase  liberty went from max liberty you had to report for school and duty to a curfew of pm on weekdays and pm on weekends. We started dropping weekend liberty chits like crazy because most of us already had plans. Like catching a concert in Chicago and then crashing at a hotel instead of trying to making to back to base before curfew. I also think we were the only school that had an evening shift and the hours really messed with the evening student who were expected to do menial labor during the day instead of being on liberty and then go to school in the evening while the day students wear able to go on liberty after school. Anyways back to the guy living government housing. Some people in the barracks complained that the live ashores didnt have the same curfew requirements as those living in the barracks. Again because we were the only school to have live ashores no one had though about this. So the schoolhouse decided that all live ashores where to give them a home phoe number a land line and not a mobile phone. Then the schoolhouse would randomly make calls to ensure that they were home during curfew hours. This particular a schooler had a daughter who was in high school. Her curfew was at pm. So as idiotic as it sounds he dropped a chit for permission to break his curfew if an emergency situation arose where he needed to go and get his daughter. Here he is a parent with a child in high school and his curfew is two hours before his childs curfew!,newtothenavy,d0jm0tt,2,t5_2v1a6

Find everything there is to know.One thing you should do is know what you want to get out your experience.Ask yourself questions like How is the advancement in the rate? What is the retention rate for the rate? What bonus pay opportunities will I receive? Will I have free time to take some college courses?Just remember to keep your end goal in mind. Whether you are doing this for  years or just enough for college.Do what you feel is best suited for you and youd enjoy. In the end be REALLY open to different rates.

I dont recommend letting yourself ship out with a job that you definitely dont want. and again be straight with your recruiter as hard as it can be since they dont seem to always want to be completely straight with you. If you pick a job at MEPS you arent going to ship out with I would straight up tell himher if this doesnt change Im not leaving.In short I wouldnt rely on crossrate suggestions from your recruiter if you are joblocked on MA then dont leave without MA simple as that.

7500792,0,t3_4i10ol,Seeing as there are already some excellent answers here  Ill play the Devils Advocate.  You say that although you enjoy the current position as Network Operations Analyst over the last two years its started to lose a bit of the magic and charm it once had.  Youve asked yourself an existential question.   Whats next?  If this daily habitual cycle of work and return home is all there is and whats next thing to do.   I applaud your decision to join the Navy I applaud trying to get an experience that not many will have in their lives before its too late  and of course taking the intiative to serve your country.   But make sure this is what you want.   Truly make sure.   Research hard.   More so to know better than that Nuclear program wasnt just a submarine  exclusive duty.  Research the lifestyle  the culture  the hours you can expect to put in.  Understand even if you dont go Nuc You may get a waiver for being a year older than the age limit but thats up in the air your job will take effort from you  and a lot of hours.  The magic you talk about may be there or not and you may or may not enjoy the joblifestyle depending on a variety of circumstances. Be flexible  adaptable  humble when its necessary.  Once you ship off  theres no turning back.   Whatever years you signed in the contract will be what you serve unless circumstance arise to change that fact.   Youve already taken the ASVAB before but decided to not go further into the process a while back so Im not sure whether you have a file at MEPS on you.   You said its been  years?   Youll have to retake the ASVAB and start the process from scratch again  ASVAB I believe lasts for  years.  But honestly good luck.   Youre doing your best to think about how to best spend part of your life.   And the Navy aint a shabby way to go.,newtothenavy,d2usuuo,3,t5_2v1a6

If being a nuke is what you really want and the first ASVAB was just not a good day for you then yes your recruiter can get you another ASVAB.

7937066,0,t3_4njcyr,Okay uSerendipitousChaos. Here we go. I previously worked at two different HSC Helicopter Sea Combat squadronsone was a full mission capable squadron and the other was a fleet replacement squadron where you would get your actual training on how to be an aircrewman. Ive worked and operationally deployed with the AWS rate which is the primary Naval Aviation rescue swimmer. First refer to this post I made regarding some the of howtos on where you need to be at a minimum to be considered for AIRR. Your fitness should be your number one priority as well as your strength in the water. Google the Navy PST standards. Meet and exceed the minimum requirements for AIRR. Learn to love the waterpool and ocean. If youre not strong in the water you cant expect to be able to save someone else who is panicked and clinging to you for dear life. I cannot emphasize this enough. You will be dropped from AIRR and be rerated if you suck ass in the water. As for inwater rescues it truly depends on your geographic location and proximity to people requiring rescue. INCONUS the Coasties usually handle those. OCONUS again it depends on where you are. HSC located in Guam does a ton of rescues each year because of the size of the island and the amount of uneducated tourists that either get sucked out to sea snorkeling or lost in the forest while hiking. My two squadrons in San Diego never got the call for one and I dont ever remember hearing about another squadron doing one either. Youre more likely to get called for a MEDEVAC than a water recovery. Bottom line if youre looking for The Guardian type shit join the Coast Guard.Now what does an AWS spend their time doing? A lot of studying swimming flying and working out. As a junior crewman youre constantly studying your helicopter specific NATOPS manual and learning the basics of your job. The goal is to become a crew chief and know the ins and outs of your aircraft. Then your next move should be to get your EAWS pin Any good aircrewman has theirs. A lot of AWs look down on it and think of it as a burden because theyre already qualified NAC but believe me it will greatly benefit you when it comes time for evaluations and promotions. Only after you become a qualified crewman and gain some rank and seniority will you be tapped for a desk job. Those desk jobs will be in the NATOPS Schedules Operations ALSS aviation life support systems or sometimes Safety departments. You will still be required to maintain your flight hour minimums and proficiencies. I wont go into too much detail on those collateral duties because Id run out of room to type quick. As far as continuing education yes there is. The Navy offers the tuition assistance program and you can also use your GI Bill while active dutyassuming you have met the minimum requirements to earn it. TA is limited in how many classes you can take per fiscal year since it is federally funded and the pot of money set aside for it is used by all branches. It has run out in the past. Also you will foot the bill for a class if you fail it or drop out of it. Beware of that. But I can guarantee you that your LPOChiefDIVO will not sign off on you taking college courses until you are a certified crewman. That is a given. Your job comes first. I think that about covers it. Hopefully I didnt scare you away. Get swimming now if this is what you want to do and good luck. Please let me know if you have any more questions. ,newtothenavy,d487997,1,t5_2v1a6

8585685,0,t3_4xem2v,The US military has two resources in abundance...time and manpower. That leads to waste. When I became LPO I was getting led around the engine room by my predecessor. I saw his work list for the division that consisted of Clean for  hours. In my back pocket I had a material deficiency list of about  separate items that needed to be fixed. I asked him why he was effectively wasting time with this bullshit. He replied that I was going to get sick very quickly of trying to get work packages done as LPO. This individual had no fucking idea what an LPOs job was despite having the position for over six months. So when I took the job over I had him moved to the other plant and everyone who had any authority under his leadership lost their position. The military tends to do a very bad job at teaching leadership in my opinion. If you have a good chain of command you get good people moving up. If you have a bad one bad habits get learned. In my case I literally had to get rid of a number of people that were dead weight with bad attitudes. I had to raise standards and expectations. This is why many people get institutionalized in the military. Their concept of leadership consists of screaming at folks and shit like that.

It takes a special type of weirdo to be a nuke I wasnt one but I was on a sub with quite a few and they are a very special people. It is not for everyone to be sure I couldnt have done it hell subs was difficult enough. School commands are different than most other commands they are typically just a different phase of bootcamp. Once you get to a boat it will be different but there is still going to be quite a bit of the hoorah bullshit I referred to it as playing the game when I was in. You are always going to have to do it to a certain level if you want to make a career of it but with a good command it isnt all that bad. A bad command though and it gets straight up exhausting though. The Navy is not for everyone but also remember you are in Nuke school which is notoriously oppressive and from what I have seen the job itself is not a lot better. If it is not your cup of tea talk to someone and see what your options are. There are good jobs and good times to be had in the Navy but you are going through a big life change. In a new place with new people and a totally different style of life it is a shock to your system. That is a lot of pressure.

This says youll spend  months at your first sea command then  months at your first shore command. Training prior to your first sea command does not have a specific set of time youre just pushed through as quickly as possible. gt I know that ranking up is dependent on availability and testing scores other than that how difficult would it be to rank up to lets say E by the end of my  year contract. Especially when starting out as an E already. I have plenty of mechanical skills and learning new skills is not difficult for me.Starting as an E really isnt much of a leg up. Picking the right rate IS. Which you have done. Over the last four years your rate has averaged  to E  to E and  to E. This numbers are ridiculous.

That being said the EM watchstanding always looked fairly interesting compared to the other rates. TH EO etc. And SRO to mix it up a little. A good TH was always pretty impressive.The least shitty rate is probably ELT based on my nonscientific studies of nuke selfloathing. ,newtothenavy,dfzlrsy,3,t5_2v1a6

Remind them this is going to another doctor not your recruiter. Additionally youll need documentation for when you where diagnosed when you were put on medication and when you were taken off.

I still dont make the money I made on the outside world Id highly recommend paying off any debts you may have as much as possible before you ship to boot... having student loans or car credit card etc on this salary isnt fun.

11737120,0,t3_67bizc,A few of the CT rates are hit or miss on amount of deployable time and CTI is mostly dependent on which language youre working with. Depending on what you speak or end up speaking you could be going out on missions or at least on ground in another country doing translate work. Either way CTI is a desk job as you were either be at a desk in an office doing your work or on a ship sitting behind a console the whole time. STG youre guaranteed to be put to sea pretty often as theres nothing for a Sonarman to really do on shore. If you actually want to deploy to sea liked the idea of STG but want a more fulfilling role then I would check out STS if you both qualify and are willing to do Sub Duty. While obviously sub life isnt for everyone you will usually find more sonar action on a boat than you will on any ship. We used sonar as our eyes and ears to move around as well as track any contacts out there. On a boat sonar is a  priority and considered safety of ship since its the only thing that keeps us from crashing into things or knowing where enemy contacts are. With a ship they have numerous other options that they prefer over sonar data. I was a prior STS if you have any questions regarding the rate or being on a submarine. ,newtothenavy,dgqfkrb,1,t5_2v1a6
