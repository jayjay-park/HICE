He is only getting help when he publicly posts the chat logs for everyone to see.I see this often here. People will have issues many many times and Comcast support will lie dodge or just do nothing until it is posted publicly.I would think that youd want to just give better service in the first place than require people to call you out before helping,Comcast_Xfinity,d6gewyh,1,t5_3d8fi

9096070,0,t1_d852k2g,Such a pain to have to login. Great feature to take away for no reason it seems. Apparently there is a watch as guest feature but you dont get all the content as if you were logged in. Plus forget finding anything you want to watch with that because there isnt even a search bar. On top of that it is a long list of both tv shows and movies cant even separate them from each other! forever autoloading as you scroll that arent even in any good order. I know autoloading is cool and it works well with RES but for when youre looking for something particular to watch from a great number of choices it isnt ideal at all. Id be okay with it if there was a search bar so I could skip past that but there isnt. You dont know if what youre looking for is even on the list because theres nothing to tell you differently so you could just be scrolling looking for something that isnt even there! So the watch as guest feature is pretty much useless unless you what you want to watch happens to be most popular at the very top of the list but even then you have to take a minute to scan the list to find what your looking for. Who puts together a list of movies and shows as large as they have and doesnt include a search bar? I have to assume they are working on implementing one because thats just stupid. ,Comcast_Xfinity,d8579jr,3,t5_3d8fi
