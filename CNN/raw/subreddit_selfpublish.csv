1678655,0,t1_cjqf0gv,What it does is tells Amazon what kind of fan base you have as a writer. In general only fairly dedicated fans preorder books especially eBooks. If you can get a bunch of people to preorder your book it tells Amazon that you have a regular stable of readers and they might want to work at giving you a slightly better placement. Also if those sales dont kick in as sales as far as rank as far as the ranking algorithm is concerned and you get a lot of preorders. When the books goes live youll shoot up in the ranks. If you shoot high enough and get a decent rank on some of the bestseller lists that can be a huge amount of exposure. When KDP Select private days were still a viable promotion tool I managed to have get one of my books hanging out in between a couple of Robert Jordan novels right after Christmas. Sales were very good that week.Also also with preorders you can actually set the date you want the book to go live not just post it and hope Amazon puts it out on the day you announce it.,selfpublish,cjqr9hs,4,t5_2sew3

Thats  free stock images and Ive done this a few times with a few different credit cards.The best part of getting your images through an actual stock photo site even if they were free on a promotion is that theres no grey area about permission and usage. Each image will usually have its own basic fine print about what it can and cant be used for and unless youre writing erotica youll find that most images on stock photo sites are fine to use on ebooks.

The difference is enormous!gt I am willing to spend this time revising editing and reading my novel  making sure there are no obvious mistakes. I will read it backwards forwards and aloud. I will meticulously examine each page a dozen times or at least thats what I tell myself.Mistakes will still get through. Writers have certain blind spots for their own writing especially when youve read it over and over.gt I have a strong grasp of grammar and will be using books like The Elements of Style The Elements of Grammar and SelfEditing for Fiction Writers.Seriously its shocking how many typosmistakes make it into the drafts that I send my editor. By then Ive done  drafts myself and had betareaders go over my manuscript and yet my editor still finds craploads of little things that make me smack my forehead.gt So am I crazy or can I do this without an editor?You really really really need an editor.

5561819,0,t3_3r9xx8,Hey! My thoughts on your siteThe very first thing I see is a cool picture of a gourd. Thats a really good looking gourde and I like it. I dont know what its doing but I think it works.Then I see the elf picture. This is the very next place my eyes go to. I dont know why you chose this picture and put it here but I think out of all your pictures and art this is the worst one. I almost closed the tab but I read in your post you won awards and was curious.The font on the elf is also too small for me to read on my monitor. I think you might miss out on some potential customers by letting that elf picture sit there. My suggestion would be to swap it out for any of the covers youve designed or just get rid of it.The covers look REALLY GOOD.The dragon is cute.Your site is a little all over the place which is honestly endearing. Youre a renaissance woman and youre rockin it. I think the elf is going to drive people away though.I think your rates are pretty reasonable.Good luck!,selfpublish,cwmht0x,2,t5_2sew3

Bunch of stuff about podcasts  irrelevant to me.Scrolls down more. Nothing else to see here I guess. Just a bunch of ads on the side.Closed the website. My visited last about  seconds with  engagement.This is simply my personal nonprofessional opinion. I didnt like it at all. I dont know literally anything about your books. Genre? Style? Titles? Art? I saw nothing. Nothing. If Im not interested in podcast blog material which Im personally not why would I ever spend more than a few seconds on your website? I didnt see any buttons that looked like fun to click. I didnt see any eyecatching art. Just blue with a goofy offputting picture.The website feels super basic. I really dont like landing pages that are also blogs. Blog landing means if the person doesnt have an interest in your current blog topic they will largely disregard the website as I did. When I go to an author website the first thing I want is a reaction. Oh cool this guy writes horror! as I see some wicked art of cthulu trashing a pirate ship or whatever.

6990392,0,t1_d18p0qo,be prepared to be very disappointed. Its just how it is on a first book. No matter how good it is in terms of Amazon search results it will be buried under thousands of other books. Amazon searches alone will lead to zero traffic.... literally zero. Not even one or two hits. Unless of course your book is a niche book or has a title that people are inputting word for word just as a search term. The thing is you cant offer a book for free on amazon anyway I think  cents is their lower limit but you can put it on sale for free for  days per  day enrollment period if youre in the kdp select program. Thats usually what people do... run it as free for  days. Theres a special list it gets put into and readers track that list plus there are lots of sites that will promote it if its free.Apparently when you start getting traction is when youve got   or  books out. That starts to rank you differently in Amazons search results. But it doesnt negate the marketing work you still gotta do. The whole issue of how to get your book noticed is a huge issue that no one really has an answer to. There are TONS of web sites out there with various insights almost all of which are utterly useless. ,selfpublish,d18pbfr,3,t5_2sew3

I believe Smashwords does not permit people to upload PD works and Amazon asks you to ensure noone else is selling the same book and that you use their  royalty scale.Translation of PD works is eligible for the  royalty scale but Im not sure whether this applies to your books or not. I would make sure theres a market for the modern English translations rather than uploading the original texts.

11285896,0,t3_60ycvs,The biggest beef I have with a lot of the advice in the selfpublishing world is that it often leaves out two critical details Interdependence on other factorsPeople will often say do x. And yes x will help. But the reason x is so successful for them is that its effects are determined by also having done a b c d and e. So someone will do x without all the other things in place and it wont work.  BudgetI dont know why but people rarely disclose their marketing spend. Theyll simply say... I did x y and z and got a ton of customers. When you dig a little deeper you find out theres a couple thousand in marketing spend in the background. So if you dont have the budget their strategies are useless to you. But you would rarely know that from the advice they are giving.  For instance people will often talk about AMS. But AMS isnt just a thing thats the same for everyone. The size of your budget among other things will dramatically influence the results you get. So telling an author to start running AMS ads is useless advice if not paired with details on spending strategies. Add to this theres a LOT of selfpublishing authors who think they know everything and are happy to give bad advice to others which they think is good advice. So the only way to figure it all out is to do it yourself. Try one thing then another then another...over time youll know whats worth your money and what isnt. For instance AMS ads work great for me and Facebook is horrible. That seems to be the opposite of what many here experience. Doesnt mean anyone is right or wrong just means different things work for different people. Only way to know what works for you is to dip your toe in different strategies and figure it out yourself. Long story short regarding your question... they arent yanking your chain but also dont think that any advice anyone gives you will be the panacea to getting readers. And yes I would say of all the variables more books is the biggest factor. It used to be three books put you on the map and made readers take a serious look at you. In todays market it seems to be six. Once again thats just my view doesnt mean it applies to all authors. ,selfpublish,dfb8n5r,2,t5_2sew3
11337924,0,t3_61svmz,Yes and no. High quality? No.  Low quality or a mix of quality? Probably. Some authors actually save up novels and will release three or more in a short period of time like one month apart. Its a whole strategy around amazons algorithms... dont ask me to explain I dont dive into all that stuff ,selfpublish,dfh4u1x,3,t5_2sew3
11362795,0,t1_dfiabok,HiDug up the source again and found out I wasnt precisely right. The thirty is just as I said but the sixty is when they stop promoting your book altogether. The catch here is that in that  promotion cliff youre up there with all the other new books so if you publish once every two months youve basically got amazon working for you  all year for discoverability.Hope that clears it up  source is Six Figure Author by Chris Fox,selfpublish,dfjy9a1,2,t5_2sew3
11450204,0,t1_dftfvq0,I do too but it doesnt fit with the genre. The original cover screams horror not dark fantasy.,selfpublish,dftvdki,6,t5_2sew3
11456257,0,t3_60i7bi,ACX.com is the selfpublishing portal for Audible Amazon and iTunes. Please note that if youre planning on selfnarrating that there is a bigger learning curve then you think so please make sure youve done your homework. Ive had too many authors come to me who have tried to do their own narration only to find out they cant actually get it published on Audible because of industry standards they werent aware of. If youre outside of the US or UK youll need to go through an audiobook publisher who can work with you to get your audiobook version published. ,selfpublish,dfuk4bp,1,t5_2sew3
11507881,0,t1_dg0evwa,Your adult adventure mystery sounds very intriguing! I am more just interested in what people are out there publishing and enjoying writing vs publishing and people are buying. I wonder how often it is the same genre. ,selfpublish,dg0f485,1,t5_2sew3
11668111,0,t1_dgik6ow,Ok thats kinda what I thought. So that ration seems pretty good then right?,selfpublish,dgilgor,1,t5_2sew3
11733345,0,t3_66qnud,Unless there is a specific reason not to I try to format my books as close to the print conventions as possible. That means that the paragraph which starts a new chapter or scene has no indent unless it is dialogue or a very short line and all the paragraphs which follow it do.I cant think of any reason to neglect indented paragraphs beyond personal taste. Conversely there is at least one functional reason for having them  they allow rapid and unambiguous identification of a new paragraph by the reader.,selfpublish,dgq06ce,1,t5_2sew3
