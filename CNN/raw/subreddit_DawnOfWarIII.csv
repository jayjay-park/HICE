11427893,0,t1_dfqoa0z,gt More factions will be introduced in expansion packs. Relic has stated that they eventually want to include all factions in the game.So you say it yourself and even show a site that says that. More factions will be included in expansions packs. Why do you think those will free? Do you know what expansion packs are?gt but I understand the hesitation to believe factions will be introduced as freeLCNo the hesitation comes from sources that even confirm that factions will come in expansion packs. Like right there you linked it yourself. gt But at the same time Itd be idiocy to think that Segarelic and the devs are blind to peoples blatant outrage at those endless dlc business approaches that drives people away from the gameTotal War Warhammer was one of the most successfull titles in the whole Total War series. The game has outragous amounts of DLCs.gt So back to the argument yeah I get the articles I listed are not strong proof as in explicit confirmation but they are compelling and speak to the subject of FreeLC for the game and what theyre hoping to do with the future business of the game.The articles themselves say that there will be expansions.The other article says thatgt Well see an expansion of some sort for Dawn of War . In terms of content between that we dont have anything concrete but where were leaning is to keep the gameplay content essentially freeContent between the expansion will be free. Like everybody said. New units or other gameplay additions doctrines etc. The expansion itself will cost money. When you still think the races will be free good luck. They wont. Its right up your face here. Its nice you try so hard to believe that but its just not the truth. You are bending some statements here in absurd ways while absolutely missing the core points of them. You can believe whatever you want but please dont complain when the first paid expansion introduces the new race. Because they never said they will release them for free. How you can not see that is beyond me but I guess its of no use to further discuss it since you even quoted articles that confirm expansions and still believe they will be free.I would love it when you are right but unfortunately you arent ,DawnOfWarIII,dfrc8ri,1,t5_3fgam

11721476,0,t1_dgohjd9,I like them too but man their unit variety is by far the lowest. Dire Avengers are completely useless and should be skipped entirely and the skimmer infantry is also useless.Almost all the decent Eldar players just skip Avengers and go straight into Banshees and Snipers.But you have to admit the drop pod stuff is very satisfying  the other races dont have something like it.,DawnOfWarIII,dgonqyc,1,t5_3fgam

No one cares about the status of your precious pre order.  gtIs there something Im missing to Orks? Or are they just this bad?

11763608,0,t1_dgtbi6r,A good example of what I mean by decisionoriented micro would be Age of Empires  where the units are able to perform the most basic tasks like staying in formation on their own leaving the player free to focus on making important choices like prioritizing targets rotating wounded units to the back lines and maneuvering to break up enemy formations. This is opposed to the StarCraft  Dawn of War  style where your units have so many stupid little activated abilities grenades trukks launching units etc that should probably be automated. The problem with all these minutia is that it leaves no time for the player to get the big picture and plan a fight. Thats why instead of pincer maneuvers and counterflanks like you see in AoE Starcraft or DoW fights usually consist of  giant blobs run face first into each other while players frantically click to cast all their abilities.,DawnOfWarIII,dgtfn8e,1,t5_3fgam

11801231,0,t1_dgx0dxg,Steam is almost a much more accessed platform now. DoW II was released in ? reviews probably came in over a very long period whereas DoW III has only been out a few days. Gaming in general has increased a large amount and there is a lot more toxicity in general. Most of the DoW III reviews are complete and utter garbage and Ive seen a large amount of reviews from people with under h in the game or under . A lot of them commenting on the current state of MP which is obviously BS. Looking at proper reviews Ive seen the game score consistently . As someone who is coming into the series for the first game with unbiased viewpoint and playing with someone whos been a die hard fan both of us have enjoyed the game. I believe theres a few features missing but overall I can see this game developing into a very solid game with a large amount of content.,DawnOfWarIII,dgxpl4v,1,t5_3fgam
