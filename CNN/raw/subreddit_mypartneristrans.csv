748955,0,t3_22ohks,I dont know where you are but it might help to find her a trans womens support or even social group. My partner really benefited from having a social outlet. She actually started by hanging out with a cross dressers group back when that was how she identified. Having the chance to have a night out as herself having support getting makeup and other passing tips and talking through things with other people who were questioning really helped. She also made friends with a few older trans women whod transitioned long before and could therefore show her how its possible to survive the coming out process and how normal life could be like on the other side.Oh and... She is really happy now. The coming out process wasnt easy she lost her marriage and her parents were not great... but shes happy Im happy and life is so much better for her than it used to be. I hope your girlfriend can see that and doesnt end her life before shes given herself a chance to live. ,mypartneristrans,cgpev50,1,t5_2t187

896239,0,t1_ch65b30,Im  and want kids by the age of  for health reasons after that age its risky. And the earliest she wants to get married is two years from now. Im going to want to get pregnant almost immediately after we marry. I dont want to have a child and then have that child become an orphan. And I dont want to have a child with her and then face a possible situation where I either have to deal with a lifelong sexless marriage if she no longer wants sex after surgery or get a divorce she is steadfastly monogamous and wouldnt tolerate an open marriage.Not to mention that as people age any kind of surgery gets more and more risky and the likelihood of complications goes up. Again if it were unavoidable  like if we were already married right now or were getting married very soon  Id stick with her and do my best. But since its very clear to me that its just a matter if time before she decides she cant live without surgery I am not on board with procrastinating until the process becomes a lot harder and riskier.,mypartneristrans,ch65nlh,2,t5_2t187

She doesnt have to use her penis she feels like a girl being penetrated I am getting penetrated too WHILE penetrating which helps some of my gender sexuality stuffs...

3061897,0,t3_2v857d,My now girlfriend and I stayed together through transitions. Ill be honest  early transition was brutal. I tried hard to be supportive getting her clothes and makeup taking care of running all her errands when she couldnt handle going outside and seeing people. The worst part was that it killed our sex life for a while  Im bisexual but she was basically going through puberty a second time and going through puberty is just... not cute.But we made it out the other end and things are better now than they were before transition by far as she is no longer insanely depressed and we know each other on a lot deeper level. The attraction is finally back which I missed. And I know now if we could weather that we can weather some tough fucking shit.Staying with a partner through transition is NOT easy but remember that the first part is the hardest and it gets much much better.,mypartneristrans,cofd2ee,4,t5_2t187

3104461,0,t1_cohc79b,I really appreciate this perspective as so many of your points really resonate with me. You are absolutely right my partner didnt ask to be transgender and I know they spent considerable time and effort trying to work it out without the need for transition. I didnt realize at the time what exactly they were trying to combat. Early in our relationship I knew about the crossdressing but it was also presented as thats it I want nothing further I dont want to be a woman I like being a man. Even when they started therapy I didnt understand that they were exploring whether or not they needed to progress beyond crossdressing to fulfill their needs. I wish they wouldve been more open and communicative about that but I understand that its scary and comes with lots of uncertainty.I guess I wouldve had a lot more time to come to terms with it if I had realized all along that this was our inevitable conclusion. For so long crossdressing was just something kinky that happened mostly in the bedroom and I honestly enjoyed it  My point is that even with  years of knowing about their crossdressing I still feel so newly wounded with the news of transition. Maybe thats unfair  but to me its a whole new ball of wax compared to our previous life. I want nothing more than to come out on the other side of transition together happy intimate and ready for our future together. I really hope we make it. Thanks for sharing your experience  you and your wife both sound like lovely people and Im so glad for your happiness.,mypartneristrans,cojryb8,1,t5_2t187

3397945,0,t3_2z3q53,I grieved severely for several months over the whole idea of her transition. I didnt want to watch my husband slowly die. But for me now its more like watch my spouse bloom. Shes so much happier and even doing the same things we used to do she seems to enjoy it more. We went to Hawaii a couple weeks ago and it was out third time there. But she told me on our last day there that it was her favorite time because she got to be herself. In ways I still feel shes still the same but shes more expressive of her emotions vocally. She was always a cuddler but now she just talks more about how she feels and theyre generally all good feelings lately. I went with her for her lasering yesterday and then we took a walk in the area. She said she liked me going with her and then just walking with me. I told her I liked being involved with the process. It makes it feel more like were going through it as a team and not just her doing it and me watching on the sidelines. Now after thats all said and done Im still grieving over some changes and worry about the long term future. I grieve over her voice changing because shes had the same voice for eight years and Ill miss it. And the selfish part of me wants to tell her shes already being gendered correctly in public why does she need to change it? And I grieve a bit over her legally changing her name soon when her male name is on our marriage license. Its the small or not so small things that add up. On the other hand Im really enjoying her breasts. Theyre not big yet but the first time I rested my head on them I thought Ohhh I could get used to this this is nice. Its so comfy! Haha.Its totally normal to have mixed emotions through this. And I know this is how its going to be for a while but in the end I know for a fact that Im happier with her than without her. It was hard to see in the beginning because when she had kept saying shed be the same person because of how things played out because of how disconnected we were and I saw little effort on her side to reconnect I thought how could she possibly be the same person when she already isnt? We had separated for a while and then the person who slowly started to come back was the person I married. For a while it was both muddled together but the person now is the person I married but happier and more expressive of her feelings. But in the mean time while Im happier too the feelings of grief over certain things are still there. And I know its okay to feel that way. ,mypartneristrans,cpflbgb,9,t5_2t187
3448084,0,t1_cpl4yy7,Thank you so much!! Wow this is really amazing. Thank you. I feel a lot better knowing that Im not the only one. I feel like I know what to expect a little bit more too. Its sad and a loss in a way and you are right that my feelings are important I need to take time to process but also remember to stay positive and supportive for my partner. I dont want my sense of loss to to anything to her feelings of freedom and wholeness. I think I need to talk to her more about that. When I try to express my feelings she gets hurt and offended and assumes that Im rejecting her as a woman but thats not how I feel at all. I like that term cognitive dissonance because I feel like thats what Im experiencing. In my mind I know im ok with her transitioning and I love it but my heart is still coping with the change.

3613477,0,t3_31r1rw,Transition is definitely a step into the unknown. You know your partner as they are now theres a great deal of uncertainty in who they will become. I have been with my spouse nearly  years and now that they are transitioning I feel the same kind of trepidation. I find it helps to remind myself that everyone is changing as we move into the future. None of us will be exactly the same in  years as we are now. Some of those changes we can control and some we cant some we choose and some we dont. At least someone who is choosing to transition is taking positive steps to align their future self with the way they see themselves.The other thing I try to remember is that the person who is transitioning is not changing their essential self. They already are their true gender and the thing which is changing is my perception of them. I find this helps remove the potential resentment in thoughts like you arent same person I married. They are the same person I married with all the same sense of humor etc. I am just learning more about them as time goes on...,mypartneristrans,cq45utq,3,t5_2t187
3713986,0,t1_cqfkoua,Please start therapy together. Or at the very least separately. Your wife needs to understand this is not going away.  What made me really understand was when I asked my wife directly about it. When she told me she said she was thinking about transitioning. Then it became a constant worry is she or isnt she? It wasnt until I flat out asked her if I wasnt in the picture at all would she do it? She said yes. Thats when I really knew and understood I was the only thing standing in her way not even her family who almost prevented her from marrying me was going to stop her from doing this. If you continue to keep going in and out of the closet your wife may not take it seriously or see it as being wishywashy. I understand why youre doing it but your wife needs to understand how important this is to you and how it affects you if you keep going back in. Please go to counseling. One of my biggest regrets my wifes too is that we didnt start counseling together sooner.,mypartneristrans,cqfmccc,1,t5_2t187
3766099,0,t3_324aj5,Hello there! I am a cis female with a MTF spouse. I will tell you up front  what you are going through is hard. As a couple things are all shaken up and your lives are affected. However what she is doing is completely normal. From what Ive experienced and read its normal for a trans person to fluctuate back and forth. My wife at one point decided she would never transition sunk into a deep depression thought maybe she would decided no not ever... sank back into that deep depression and then finally decided she was going to do it. She has been on hormones now and is almost full time. It took a while but she finally made a decision and we are on smoother waters! We personally never really have problems but its everyone else in your lives no matter how supportive that make things hard sometimes. Dont let anyone push you guys around  and what your spouse seems to be going though is what mine did too. It will level out. Your spouse has to be who they truly are. As long as you support that you will be okay!,mypartneristrans,cqlkasn,2,t5_2t187

My parents live a few states over and we arent super close but I would be heartbroken if they didnt want me in their life because of who I love.That is one of the main reasons I want to just tell them  She wont have to live the lie any longer.

Unfortunately I dont really have any advice to offer I dont even know what to do in my own situation. My partners sex drive started plummeting a few months into our marriage and now a month after hormones its completely nonexistent. Its really hard to not feel wanted to not have any sex at all when my libido is through the roof and to lack the nonsexual intimacy. She doesnt hold my hand much lately cuddle or even kiss me beyond a quick peck. Talk really has gotten us nowhere I just end up in tears of loneliness and frustration and she just sort of shuts down. Sometimes it feels like shes not even trying or doesnt care about my needs its certainly the thing I struggle with most.I really wish I could help but like you I have tried just about everything. Im just trying the best I can to ride out the hormone sideeffects and hope itll get better in time. I would still bring it up every so often you have just as much right to have your relationship needs satisfied as your girlfriend does and you have just as much right to speak up when those needs arent met. Its just a difficult time for everyone so everybody has to sacrifice and it sucks.edittypos,mypartneristrans,cqycxo5,2,t5_2t187
3878720,0,t3_34tsat,I am also struggling with this same question.  My family is a group of very nice people they really are. However there are two major issues with them . Its nearly impossible to have a serious conversation with them . They are not very openminded.  My partner has suggested that she would prefer not to come out to my family but instead slowly make changes as time goes by and respond to questions as they come. For me this is a real challenge. It feels like staying in the closet and continuing the vaguery that weve employed for years. It also doesnt allow me to ask anyone in my family for support for what Im going through related to transition or to ask for understanding.  Add to that weve got two college aged daughters that spend a lot more time with our families than we do. We do plan to tell our daughters and I feel like its too much to ask for them to have to keep that secret from my family. I dont want to put them in such a difficult position. Our families already ask them a lot of questions about our life out here what we do etc...  This is so tough because on one hand I feel like she has the right to come out the way she feels is right but on the other hand this is going to have a major impact on my life. Im not extremely close with my family but I love and support them and they do the same kind of... for me. I really dont want to lose them and I think the way we come out will impact our success.  It is pretty scary I agree with you. Although Ive never seen eye to eye with my parents theyve always been proud of me and have given me love. I would be really sad without them in my life. Im so nervous that this will be the thing that will break us my parents and I. I think it is like everyone else has said it is going to be really scary until we just do it.  I said this in another thread but it bears repeating Ive spent a long time being a bit resentful that weve been living in the closet so long but now that its getting closer to the time to come out...well...you know...its not all that bad in here ,mypartneristrans,cqyeosi,3,t5_2t187

Fortunately I think my partner feels confident that their friends and family will be very supportive if and when they transition. It was also just so so nice for them to meet other people going through the same stuff and make some trans friends. They werent sure if the support group setting is a perfect fit but its a good first step.

So it wasnt until we got back together when I shared it with them. Even now I do not tell them or my family that I still struggle at times.The thing is even if trans becomes more normal in society loved ones will always have emotions about it. I dont think just because youre accepting and supportive of it and so is society that you suddenly wont experience any negative emotions anymore. So even if its not a big deal in society I think it will always affect loved ones emotionally on a deep level. Her ideal is that you just say hey Im transitioning and everyone is just like okay thats cool nonchalantly and life goes on like nothing changed at all.

We have a joint account that I transfer money into but shes the only one who uses it. Financially this works for us because if she moved out and started working again we wouldnt be able to afford a second residence AND putting the kids in day care full time.

Its not as if you were talking about changing hair color its a really big change in your day to day life and in your future.You really should talk about all of this with a close friend or a therapist. And when I say you I mean YOU not you and your partner even if they should talk to one too. I dont know how to have cheap therapy maybe others in this sub can help on this point... But you have to talk to someone to sort your feelings out. Itll take time it may be hard... But I hope youll find some answers. Its important to help your SO as much as you can but you matter too and you have to figure out your needs in this situation and take care of them.

5089303,0,t3_3kp8oq,Ive never posted here before but I hope its okay since Im transgender and this isnt coming from my partner. We started dating when I was a senior in high school and she was a sophomore. I came out to here right around when I turned . She was not accepting at all and said she probably wouldnt stay. She had been raised by her extremely devout Southern Baptist Grandparents so she was extremely LGBTphobic when I met her. In fact she didnt even believe in evolution. She wouldnt even entertain the idea of hanging out at our friends house if our gay friend came over. I was madly in love with her though and I tried to go back into the closet. Anyways we went on to have our first child and then when she was  months pregnant with our second son we talked about it again. I was  at the time and extremely depressed and I just couldnt do it anymore. I was really bothered especially at the idea of being a dad. I had always tried to avoid using the word around our first born because deep down I knew I couldnt continue like this for much longer. She was much much more accepting this time. She had grown much more tolerant and accepting at that point. She even embraced evolution by then lol!  We talked about it and she agreed to letting me see a therapist. She was fine with it until I brought home the letter... I had to talked to her about it a lot but I dont think it ever set in. I think she though I was going to see the therapist and one day come home and be like lol trans? Nope! But that didnt happen and the letter kind of set into motion everything. She was really upset I remember we got into a fight and she was talking to my mom who was like a mom to her. My mother was also against it all so they kind of went back and forth on how terrible the therapist was for doing this to them. I talked to the therapist and she felt it would be important to let her come to some sessions and share her feelings. It really helped some tears were shed by everyone but things got better from there. Three years later yesterday was my rd year of HRT anniversary we are still happily together and she is my biggest supporter. I know this was a long and rather anticlimatic post but I just wanted to let you know it happens and I think much more often then youve been led to believe. My biggest suggestion is patience communication and understanding. When you transition its not just you transitioning. Everyone in your life is transiting with you to varying degrees. Just like we look for help and understanding so do they. ,mypartneristrans,cuzgc12,4,t5_2t187
5109974,0,t1_cv0pyp8,Curious...are you currently transitioning?  I am asking on behalf of my spouse we are quasiseparated in the same house still in separate bedrooms and one of the things she has mentioned is that she wonders if it would be easier to wait until shes fully transitioned to date again.,mypartneristrans,cv1xz90,2,t5_2t187
5134829,0,t3_3lafu1,I think the most important thing to do in this situation is step back and look at the things that identify you as male and see if she treats that way. Does she call you by male pronouns does she refer to you as a guy when she talks to you do you feel masculine? When you were intimate did she let you be the man? When you are out in public does she make you feel like you are a man?I know for my wife I have to ensure all those things happen or she gets down on herself and I feel bad for making her feel that way. If your ex doesnt make you feel like a man then I would suggest not getting back together because you could fall back into the same old pattern as before. In order for you to be with her you have to be seen and treated for who you are not who you were and who she wants you to be.Like Zombiiegir said it may have taken you two breaking up her trying to date and meet people for her to realize that she is attracted to you still and flexible with what you have to offer.

If youre concerned about immediate backlash perhaps a letter or email might be preferable so you dont have to be in the room.Do you have reason to be concerned for your safety or having a lack of shelter? If so it might be beneficial to wait until after you move out since youre going to be doing it soon.

5290117,0,t3_3ndznw,When my fiance first came out to me it was without warning I am a strait cis female and she was a strait man we had been together already for  years and I had many of the same fears as you. I have never been attracted to women and you are absolutely right about not being able to change your sexuality.  I told her I wouldnt leave and that I would support her through this but I was so scared that I might not be able to do it.  I realized that in the end I might not be able to reconcile what I wanted with what she wanted so I changed my stance on her transition. I told her I would make no decisions until later.  Instead of seeing her as my partner I decided to see her only as my best friend and this took some pressure off.  Now it was a matter of my best friend going through something incredibly difficult and I would be there to support them.  For an entire year I panicked I had break downs I saw a therapist  I started smoking again in an attempt to not kill her no one warned me about female puberty.  Pickledpenguinpossum is exactly right tho watching her become the woman she is today has deepened my love and respect for her.  I thought at first that I could get used to her being a woman or get over it at least but what I found was that I began to love her not despite being a woman but because of it.  She is absolutely the person she should be. She is a better person she loves deeper laughs harder and loves both me and herself more than I ever thought possible.  Three weeks ago she gave me the most beautiful proposal I could have asked for and when I said yes it was without hesitation and and I knew that although I never expected to have a wife someday that there is not a man alive today who could make me happier than my sweet lady does.  I live for her worship her as a woman she is beautiful and her female body arouses me more than any man I have ever known.  My best advice is dont make any decisions while youre going through this It will be hard and there will be times when you feel you cant do it but if you wait through all the turmoil you may just find that a lesbian can love a man as I found a strait woman can love a woman or you might find that it is not a life that you want either descision you make is fine if you cant do it there is no shame and you will have no reason to feel bad because you tried.  Good luck OP I Truely wish you and your partner all of the happiness that you can handle and remember your partner needs support but you do as well.

5891617,0,t3_3vyztg,You should definitely talk to your boyfriend about your concerns. I know its super hard to be open about this but if theres a possibility you may not be able to cope or adapt to the changes that will occur during transition he needs to know that.Ill admit I wasnt as open in communicating with my partner about the feelings of griefloss as I should have been but we did discuss the possibility that I may not be able to deal with the changes and her being with a woman. If that happened we agreed it might be best to move on. I chose to stay committed and try to figure us and myself out but understanding I wasnt obligated to do so put less pressure on both of us and was an allaround better situation to be in.As far as your own orientation its OK not to be sure exactly where you fit only know that youre not straight. I can relate somewhat to the way your feelings for women are weaker or less clear although I currently identify as bisexualpansexual. But I didnt label myself anything for a long time only deciding that I wasnt straight while terms like queer or fluid seemed applicable. Calling myself a bisexual is more a way of naming it not beating around the bush now that Im very obviously in a queer relationship.It could be that your boyfriend winds up being the sort of woman youre into or your love for him overrides the specifics of gendersex. Or hes not and those specifics could be a more important component of your love. Its so individual one cant really say. You can only feel your way around test it and conclude yes or no.,mypartneristrans,cxrxber,3,t5_2t187

And I call her female pronouns at home and when we are alone but it is very hard for her to move forward.It didnt change anything for me.

5965997,0,t3_3wfqg0,Ill explain a little of why hrt is very important to a trans woman fighting dysphoria. hrt involves both giving the body estrogen and using antiandrogens to stop the process of testosterone. Trans women who are able to get on hrt earlier in life experience fewer of the permanent changes testosterone causes in the body. Not to mention further masculinization with age can be dysphoric for mtf trans women. My wife was rather urgent about getting hrt though it still took her time to be ready for it. But turning  and beginning to grow a fuller beard helped her realize how dysphoric she really has been. I would suggest researching HRT a bit to help you feel more comfortable. The statistics for trans women regretting going on hrt is well rather low and in most cases delaying things only increases dysphoria. The process of going through hormones was described by our doctor as nearly if not identical to a second puberty and so certain things that are permanently changed by estrogen breast size for example will be permanent as well but that things like fat distribution are entirely determined by what hormones exist in our bodies at the time. Doctors take bloodwork before giving out hormones so your girlfriend will have people who know she is healthy and will be able to change her dose if she ever needs to if that makes you more comfortable to know. Sperm banks are doable and definitely something you can save for. You might call and ask if any of them can do payment plans for the upfront costs. My wife and I once wondered and questioned whether or not her transness was a fetishthat was actually our initial conclusion since neither of us had heard of transgender people before. She came out to me a year into our dating as someone who liked wearing girl clothes. We started incorporating that similarly to you. What we later discovered was that it wasnt so much a fetish as it was just she felt more sexual and comfortable when she dresses femininely so it made sexual things better relieving the underlying dysphoria that comes with the internalized gendered expectations involved in sex. Since she already viewed it as a just liking crossdressing thing she didnt explore her gender identity for a long time but she used to try to justify her desires to relieve dysphoria as if it was part of her desire to cross dress. I used to question it too. Why would you want a fetish to be a part of your life ?? because that is essentially what she described before she knew she was transgender. She just really was trans thats why it never made sense that she was so adamant about just a cross dressing fetish. Looking back I wish we had the access to the information we do now back then it would have saved us a lot of confusion and frustration. ,mypartneristrans,cy1o9cf,1,t5_2t187
6003093,0,t1_cy6gmgl,Im  my girlfriend is . I live at home for  months of the year and the other  months I spend at university at the other end of the country. Before I was with my girlfriend my mum has always been incredibly controllingstrict and would take her anger out on me for other things anyway but since then the situation has worsened because she actually has a reason to be angry at me now rather than just shouting at me for nothing like she would before. Aside from the fact she owns the house which we live in Im not financially dependent on her at all as I receive more student loan than she earns in a year. Its hard to respect her rules though as she rings me up and tells me off for seeing my girlfriend even in the time when Im away from home when really she has no control over me at all. I try to speak to her in a mature way but because I am young she isnt willing to listen and tells me to shut up because im wrong because Im not old enough to know any better.

6159928,0,t3_3zx30e,Im sorry his parents have reacted badly   It will be very hard on him to have to deal with their rejection then to have them threaten to end his work relationship with them adds another layer of stress on top. I am sure that you are feeling extremely angry at them and upset on his behalf and upset for yourself too as it is so hard to see your loved one suffer emotionally. My heart goes out to you both.As for being supportive just do your best to be there for him with cuddles kind words and space if he needs it. You both may be irritable due to the stress and grief so make allowances for yourself as well as him. Allow yourself to feel that anger and express it here if it helps if you dont want to rant too much around your partner.My partners mothers initial reaction wasnt great and it was so painful to witness and awful for my partner. Her parents didnt cut off ties with us though and things went a little better when we saw them again at Christmas. I wanted to find resources to help them understand but I assumed most of the stuff for parents is for parents of children were in our forties. Perhaps I wrongly assumed and didnt look hard enough  I dont think theyll read it anyway. I dont know if you feel able to talk to his parents and offer to help educate them  no idea if that is a good idea or not depending on the situation and how they might react.I hope someone with a clearer head can provide some advice on how to handle them. I just wanted to offer some support. I suppose your partner needs to consider alternative employment if they dont come around  being given the condition of continued repression of himself in order to remain in the family work relationship is so unfair. As a parent I cannot understand conditional love. Thats what hurt us so much when my partners mother told her to just carry on as she always had in other words repress her true self and pretend to be a man so she mother wouldnt have to deal with uncomfortable emotions. We want our children to be themselves and to be able to come to us with any problems they may have no matter how big and scary and to feel safe that we wont reject them for who they are or whatever situation they find themselves in. I know the media and psychiatric community has portrayed trans people in a very negative way in the past so older people have deeper layers of transphobia to work through than younger generations. Part of the grieving process parents of trans kids go through is denial they are probably mistakenly thinking this is some modern lifestyle choice so feel like they can forbid it or something stupid like that. I hope your partners parents come around sometimes time helps them to understand but be prepared to do a lot of supporting if they dont.,mypartneristrans,cyptjl6,1,t5_2t187

6613462,0,t3_469lpw,First hugs. This is a difficult thing but many of us here have been where you are. You are not alone.Second you mention everything up until transitioning. Transition can mean a lot of different things but there is a sort of buffet of options for people transitioning MtF usually including dressing in feminine clothing wearing makeup or a feminine hairstyle removing facialbody hair changing voice or mannerisms adopting a new name hormone treatments surgeries for facethroatscalp removal of testicles and vaginoplasty. Some trans people do all of these things most pick and choose about a third of trans people have the surgery. So transition isnt a single thing  it is an individual process that can take many forms. Do you mean that think you cant be with your spouse if they are living full time as a woman in public? Or do you mean that you cant stay if they get a vagina?In any case thats jumping the gun. Your spouse has just started on what can be a very long journey. Its tempting to jump to the endpoint and envision a complete stranger but really your spouse will probably transition slowly. Maybe a little mascara this week a skirt next week. You can test yourself with each change asking Am I still ok with this? If you find that you are still attracted to your spouse you just keep going. If not you end it amicably. You are right the whole I wont transition if it means you leave me is manipulative bullshit and I wish it werent such a common thing for trans people to saythreaten but it is. I know it is coming from a place of pain and fear. But it is not realistic and it unloads responsibility for everyones happiness onto the shoulders of the nontransitioning partner.Some things to keep in mindCommunication is very important. Talk through your feelings together. Its better to say Im feeling a little uncomfortable about this than to stew in silent resentment.Your feelings matter. So does your sexual orientation. Your partner needs your support right now but that doesnt mean you need to be a martyr suppressing your own needs and attractions to accommodate them. You can love someone even if you are not married to them. A gender transition is a big deal and sometimes it is just too much for a marriage. That could be because of sexual attraction but it can also be because there may have been years of deception or because the parties just cant do the Olympiclevel honestycommunicationforgivenessempathy required. You can love and support your partner through their transition and still break up if that is whats best for you.Last more hugs. I hope youll stick around here.

Instead of telling her to cool down on it which might be difficult have you tried helping her get comfortable with feminine tasks? Like putting on makeup working on her hairstyle helping her choose clothes... Working on the causes and not the consequences might help a bit if shes open to it.For the praise I think thats pretty normal. Shes still constructing her selfconfidence as a woman... Have you tried telling her its a bit too overwhelming for you? Try to tell her in a calm setting and put an emphasis on your feelings. Like I understand you need to be reassured but its a bit too much sometimes and I cant handle all of it ? And that last past about you being jealous in completely inappropriate and sounds like purposely hurtful. If I were you I would call her out on this as soon as I could.

Im not bashing divorce by any means I understand that sometimes things happen whether it be a mutual or a decision initiated by one party. Basically I dont want to jump into it.

Franklin also has a blog The Ethical Slut by Dossie Easton and Love in Abundance by Kathy Labriola are good as well. ,mypartneristrans,d482ybp,3,t5_2t187
8350719,0,t1_d5ldyi6,Yeah... When this all came out I was DESPERATE to get it out of my head. I found some sort of list serve but had no clue how it worked.

8641147,0,t3_4y6x22,wtf? I would be pissed. Its like implying our relationship doesnt matter anymore what because shes trans? because shes a girl? TBH I did grow up knowing guys who literally didnt think girlgirl relationships were real bc basic misogyny. Yuck.Ive never had anyone come onto me because of this. Ive gotten a lot more Are yall...sisters??? friends??? from strangers who dont realize girls can be gay but no one outright hitting on me. ,mypartneristrans,d6lr409,4,t5_2t187
8642218,0,t3_4y6x22,Just like any other person in a committed monogamous relationship would...tell them to buzz off.That said I do think we partners have to be on high alert particularly if our relationships are rocky because of transition or if we are feeling lonely or forgotten etc.  Before my spouse and I decided to separate I was propositioned by a few douche bags who clearly only wanted to take advantage of what they saw as my vulnerability.  If a relationship is rocky or uncertain or if dysphoria has led our partners to not give us the attention we need and deserve I can see why it could be tempting to get sucked into the attention.But long story short your gf handled it very well and I dont think the situation needs to be handled any differently just because youre trans.,mypartneristrans,d6lvy3c,3,t5_2t187

8821766,0,t3_50ztl3,I asked my husband what I should say in reply to your question since weve done lots of fun happy stuff since he came out last year but none of it is really transrelated.  He said to just say that how the stuff that goes into a happy relationship is . . . gosh he put it so eloquently and I cant even remember now.  And he said that even though being trans is his thing really its something were still sharing right now.  Plus we talk more get along better and hes an overall happier person and nicer to be around since he started transition.  Were currently on our first vacation without the kids in almost seven years and its delicious! But doesnt have anything to do with him being trans other than remembering to pack his estrogen pills.  I hope thats kind of useful and what youre looking for! ,mypartneristrans,d7896xt,1,t5_2t187
8936008,0,t3_52oict,Oh I get that. My wife was terrible at explaining or remembering things that were discussed at her appointments when she first came out to me and I was still new and learning about transition. At one point she even told me they were testing her blood to see if she was trans before she could start HRT. I wasnt so ignorant to know that there is no such test! But she just had tunnel vision at that point so it just left me in a bigger state of confusion with no answers or understanding the process. I learned most stuff on my own by frequenting rasktransgender Even now she messes with her antiandrogens sometimes by taking Spiro stopping it and switching to Finasteride then stopping that and switching to Spiro or doing a mix. I tell her that she shouldnt be doing that willy nilly and should be talking to her doctor first if shes having issues that its probably not a good idea to mess with the hormones like that. She just doesnt want to bother though. x.x,mypartneristrans,d7lz5f8,6,t5_2t187
9123634,0,t1_d88g6sp,I find your reading a bit tendentious.

There is a family portrait of us taken the week before my partner came out to me  a great portrait with both kids smiling for once  that I just cant look at. Take time and space for yourself. Do you keep a journal? Or have a special trailgardenmuseumshore that is special to you? Now might be a good time to care for yourself by either expressing your feelings or surrounding yourself with familiaritycomfort. It can be frustrating when you are doing ok  of the time and truly being supportive and happy for your partner just to have Grief sneak up and clobber you over the head. It doesnt mean youre doing anything wrong it just means that this is emotionally complicated. Good luck to you and I hope tomorrow will be better.,mypartneristrans,d88o7bg,11,t5_2t187

9432861,0,t1_d9bll4t,We do try to communicate however I feel that her going to talk with my therapist was the best thing we could have done. It helped us open up and talk about things we might not have talked about at home by ourselves. At first small changes did bother her a little i.e. shaved legs but recently it doesnt seem to as much. I know that communication is the key here. She did say at our therapy session that her biggest fear aside from family relationships was that I would transition and not want to be with her if that was  years down the road where would that leave her. Im honestly still very attracted to her and want to be with her even if I were to transition I dont think that would make a difference and I would still want to. What steps have you and your partner taken to ease into presenting more feminine?,mypartneristrans,d9bohzv,2,t5_2t187
9453765,0,t3_59z8u6,I read your other post and Im sorry about your experience the guy seems like an asshole. But for me Ive laid everything up front to my fiance. We never act like Im a woman in bed she just always knew I had that desire but I never wanted her to satisfy me in that way. I only ever cared about satisfying her. I was and still am ok never being a woman sexually. I dont want her to be uncomfortable or feel like she has to stay with me but I just want her to understand I never meant to hurt her and I absolutely didnt hide anything from her. I hate myself so much. Im considering not transitioning at all but still having her know I have those desires. Because I cant lie. This isnt sexually driven why I want to transition its dysphoric driven. I could deal without ever having sex again and be happy and I could have sex forever and be happy. All that makes me happy is intimacy trust loyalty and honesty from a person in a social sense not in a physical the physical doesnt matter to me but I like helping other peoples physical wants. This whole revelation is shocking to myself. And I hate that its a part of me. But I could never hurt somebody directly on purpose. I dont believe in manipulation for happiness my family did that to me for their whole lives. I dont believe in lying to have a good life I dont believe in being a fake. These are also all the reasons I never had friends. Because the real me is androgynous leaning feminine quirky and odd but she liked me that way. I only fake being a person to my family at formal events because in order to live and not die here in conservative Texas you cant be yourself if you are like me. But she fell in love with the me and I havent changed theres just correlations being made of why Im this quirky androgynous leaning feminine etc person. Im nothing like your husband and my experiences are completely unlike his experiences. Im a completely different person from him. I dont hurt others in order to settle down or have happiness Id rather kill myself than hurt someone else. Im a flawed person of course like everyone is I lie on the occasion like if she looks bad on one day Ill say she looks good but only sometimes usually Im brutally honest.  But the fact is I didnt know about this and just because somebodys transgender doesnt mean they have to know about it their whole lives and that they lie to people. I know people are terrible to people who are transgender but that doesnt mean we lie in retaliation and hurt others so we can be happy. Because I never did that. But I do know there are a lot of people who do that and I pity them but I disagree with you it is their faults because they could have told the truth just because they were hurt doesnt give them the right to hurt others to live or be satisfied. Your husband sounds like a passiveaggressive ass. Ive been truthful about who I am to everybody except for people in power like cops or parents or teachers or psychiatrists because those people will kill you and lying to them doesnt hurt them because they have no emotional investment in you they are just there to regulate you for their desire. But people not in power equals Ive always been honest to and thats why I am picked on bullied etc because people dont like me and Ive only found one person that ever liked me. But because of how the world views people like me its probably to much for her. And I dont blame her. I just want her to know the truth. She deserves the truth but I dont think she believes the truth. I cant even commit suicide because of how it would hurt her. Ive been bullied ostracized and physically and mentally abused my whole life but I have never lied to her or misled anybody into a fake life so I could be happy. People are terrible and cruel but she isnt one of those people and neither am I. Even if she abandons me she isnt doing it because she is cruel and mean. And by abandon I mean as never seeing me again as even friends. I think your husband is probably a sociopath if he doesnt care about your happiness. Im not looking for a solution Im just looking for a way to explain it to her truthfully,mypartneristrans,d9ebyeg,1,t5_2t187
9483181,0,t3_5ao7k7,Short answer to your question No. You deserve to have the partner you want the life you wish to live the love and desires you wish to have. I wonder what it would be like if you were as concerned about yourself as you are about your spouse.Do you know why they landed on gender fluid as opposed to something else? I wonder how content they are to present male as opposed female. From what I understand of someone who is gender fluid it is based on an emotional preference or circumstantial inkling hence the neutral pronoun. Its often they not he or she otherwise they would constantly have to correct people and they can encompass both or nothing. Theres also bigender but Im less informed about that beyond a basic definition. Do you think your spouse merely gets by being a man at work but truly wishes to present and be a woman more than they do when theyre at home? What Im getting at here is what if your partner is a transwoman but is choosing to either repress or deny that because they dont want to go through making the vast amount of changes that often come with that. That being said gender fluidity doesnt solely exist between a binary. Just some thoughts. ,mypartneristrans,d9i08ew,3,t5_2t187
9521912,0,t3_5b95ss,Yes most definitely. This is something we lost as part of our straight privilege.

9851504,0,t3_5ge426,I proposed just last June after  years as boyfriend and girlfriend. We had a big party I was throwing in New Orleans with online friends who were traveling from all over the country as part of an annual meetup. I booked dinner for  of us on a steamboat with a jazz band. I was so nervous I barely ate the meal. After dinner we were mingling on the deck of the boat for dancing and cocktails. I had several people with cameras ready and got a spot cleared out to ask the question at the front of the boat when the sun started to set. I brought her over and with  of our friends standing around I got on one knee popped the question and brought out the ring. The stuff that went through my mind as I was planning this out was thisA she was from the south and her family way back was from Louisianna so paying respect to her family history by proposing in New Orleans seemed like the right placeB we had a lot of people from our community there to support and celebrate with usC it was in public so that she could see how proud I was to have her be my wife but it wasnt an over the top spectacle that might embarrass her either. ,mypartneristrans,daro9h1,3,t5_2t187

10968562,0,t1_de9divf,She came with me to the therapist and he explained a few things and what future options. She took it hard.

11029781,0,t3_5xcbtl,Lots of other people have commented on why your partner may not have brought up being transgender and they have really good points. But your comment seems to express more distress over finding out shes bisexual if Im reading right so I hope I can offer a little perspective on that. One thing worth knowing is that theres this idea floating around out there that bisexual people are more promiscuous or more prone to cheating and its completely a myth. Bisexual people are attracted to more than one gender but theyre no more or less likely to be monogamous than the next gay or straight person. Your partner is in a relationship with you and shes with you for a reason. Shes no more likely to be checking out guys now than she was to be checking out other women before you knew she was trans or bi. As far as why she may not have brought up her past relationships with men bisexual people face sort of a double whammy of being queer and thus marginalized in society but being able to pass as straight when theyre in relationships with people of opposite gender and thus shunned by parts of the LGBT community. As she settled into a long term relationship with you she may have just wanted to try to forget all the identity politics of bisexuality and just live as a straight person where she wouldnt have to care about what society or other LGBT people think of her. Its likely something thats freshly at the forefront of her mind as she transitions and finds herself to be a woman in love with a woman and no longer able to pass as straight. Much like with being trans theres a lot of fear about coming out to people as bisexual and plenty of reasons someone might try to suppress it even in their own mind if they think its not relevant to their life at the time. The important thing to remember is that even though you have this new knowledge that makes it feel like everythings different shes still essentially the same person youve always known. Separately it might be worth talking to a therapist if you can especially one whos familiar with LGBT people and their families. Being partners with someone whos transitioning can be a lot of pressure and its important for you to have outside support where you can vent and talk things through aloud and work through your emotions freely. ,mypartneristrans,dei78do,6,t5_2t187

11403364,0,t3_62dwwo,I agree with what uLateNightFright says here gtIt isnt a trans people shouldnt be allowed to post here especially when trans people have partners who may be transitioning. Its that the main thrust of this forum should be support and care for the partners of trans people. That includes acknowledging normal responses that may not be socially acceptable and may be hurtful to trans people. Mourning physical attraction not wanting to be queer worrying about sex resenting the stress etc. are made to seem selfish and wrong. I even tried to modify the tone of my responses a year or so back and am more cautious about what I respond to because my experiences may not match a posters and I feel like that has a negative effect on whatever opinion or advice I give partly why I lurk more than participate.Im still not sure whether removing posts or setting up another forum is the answer probably because Ive never seen questions from the trans partner themselves predominate. So I wonder if its more of a recent issue or something that comes in waves. Most IME are not terrible but I also havent closely watched the threads implicated here. Better moderation or monitoring of posts might help but perhaps also spelling out the focus more...erm emphatically? in the guidelines could help too?
