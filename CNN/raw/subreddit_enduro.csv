7761244,0,t3_4ljeai,Difference between the hard enduro and cross cycles goes a bit deeper than that.Enduro have heavier flywheels meaning they have better torque and dont spin the rear wheel as fast. This makes it easier to hold grip with the terrain. This stuff becomes really obvious when doing some extreme climbing stuff for example. Wet conditions make it even more obvious.Other difference is suspension itself. Enduro has a bit less damping and bit softer springs. This becomes obvious when driving on rocks for example.By changing only sprockets I dont think you will make any big improvements since they are not core of the problem. You will possibly make it harder to slow climb stuff.,enduro,d3oe5z7,1,t5_2vrho
