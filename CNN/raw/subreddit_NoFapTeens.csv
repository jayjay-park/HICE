1321596,0,t3_297v27,You gotta keep reminding yourself why you wanna do this and not allow yourself any excuses to touch it. Dont think Ill just look at a little bit. Or Ill fap a bit and stop before I O.  Only allow yourself to touch it for washing and bathroom.,NoFapTeens,ciiaopa,1,t5_32b32
5614866,0,t1_cwt2csc,You are doing really good. Keep going and eventually you will make it! By the way I have the same story as you. Iam doing it for  years now and I relapse once in a while. But my streaks are improving and my brain is rewiring. I also started at an early age an thats why it is hard to cut it out of our life.Succes buddy!Thomas,NoFapTeens,cwt2ty4,2,t5_32b32

9046872,0,t3_53tc9p,Unfortunately thisll only be avoiding your problem or giving you another one. Try as hard as you can to quit fapping without resorting to another addiction as a distraction. Trust me smoking will cause you just as much trouble in the long run as fapping.Good luck on quitting jacking off!,NoFapTeens,d7zafhh,1,t5_32b32

10268637,0,t3_5n15m4,Yes!The second part is to spread the word. Let people know there is a community for them and tell them about the advantages of it for us over regular nofap. For example I notice that on the regular nofap subreddit there is a lot of talk about sex while for obvious reasons that just isnt too relevant yet for the posters here. I can imagine that some teen posters dont want to talk about something theyre not experiencing yet all the time so thats a reason they might appreciate this subreddit more. Thats just one reason there are of course many others not the least of which is that its natural to want to be among peers people who know what youre experiencing because they are doing the same. Spread the word! ,NoFapTeens,dc808hg,2,t5_32b32

10596624,0,t3_5roea2,Best advice I can give you is that you need to believe in yourself. A good attitude means youre aleady halfway there. You can do this you have the power! ,NoFapTeens,dd8yktv,2,t5_32b32
