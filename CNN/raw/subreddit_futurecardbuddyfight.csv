5772049,0,t1_cxchtlp,Yes.  Regardless of whether or not you have valid targets you may cast or Activate any ability.  If you dont have valid targets upon the castactivation of the ability then you fail targeting at this point and the ability will fizzle during resolution.  If you are using an ability with a Call Cost or a mandatory payment upon resolution Dragowizard Gan AlkimiaWhite Dragon Hermit Nanase you will still pay for the effect even though the ability will fizzle.  Your opponent will still have a Counter timing to respond to the ability even if you arent planning on using it or if it will fizzle from lacking targets.But for this particular case  Cast Cost is paid first before any aspect of the card resolves.  After this you choose targets to call and zones leftrightcenter to call the cards in.So you may use the gauge paid for Continue! to call Brave Drum in this case.,futurecardbuddyfight,cxckr6t,1,t5_2xk0o

11644543,0,t1_dgfsdyd,Ahh makes sense lol yeah I really like the aesthetic plus water is probably my favorite element easily. Agreed though if there was a water world Id buy in easily. Ill look around for sure I guess and see if anything else catches my interest ,futurecardbuddyfight,dgfx855,1,t5_2xk0o
