6508943,0,t3_44simx,Reposting this from a previous thread I responded togt The guide is terrible though it looks like the old TV guide channel. Depending on where you are its better than others. SA systems use a guide that looks like windows . Motorola systems have a slightly better guide though its buggy...gtThe world box and the new CloudUI are what you have been hearing about. It looks a lot like the interface you have available on your tablet and phone under the Spectrum app. Those look pretty slick. CloudUI when available in your area will replace the current guide on your current box. So supposedly you wont have to change boxes for that.Worldbox and CloudUI according to multichannel will be rolling out through out the rest of the year. So sadly no confirmed dates for specific markets yet.,chartercable,czskovx,2,t5_30577

It sounds like that server is where the issues is. Your going to have a hard time getting them to acknowledge it though. It be easier just trying gigapower frankly. ,chartercable,dc7obi1,1,t5_30577
