Your dreams are the most obvious and provable characters of your subconscious. So just as I would suggest you analyze the fears in your waking life to better understand your self I would say even more so in your dreams.You have the power to protect yourself and you have the power to influence others to help them protect themselves but not to actually protect them from themselves. It is within each of us to control and manage our intent in each moment. No one else shares that responsibility no one else can. But we can help each other. Today will be a good day for you. Just wait and feel and know. Set down your anxieties and focus on the positive today and today you may have the chance to prove that you are capable of traveling from one dimension to another. Its literally that simple. Which turns out to be rather complicated.,MessiahComplex,cx9961p,3,t5_39t9w
