8110737,0,t3_4qbq9v,Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. Im so distressed right now I dont know what to do. I didnt mean to do that to my mom but Im literally in shock from not getting my mail. I feel like Im going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is it not here? This cant be happening. Im having a fucking breakdown. I dont want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want my purchases from Amazon so I dont have to worry about my money anymore. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasnt supposed to be like this I thought I had picked sameday delivery???? This is so fucked.,ModelUSPS,d4rpxfu,1,t5_3f8m8
