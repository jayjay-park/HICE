3252149,0,t3_2xcub2,It is a form of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia CBTi formally called sleep restriction therapy. SRT has been very helpful for me. Typically I go to sleep between  and  and wake up at  adjusting based on SRT. I find that if I follow the schedule diligently I.E. no napping no extra laying in bed I dont need to go under  hours. If my sleep schedule gets messed up somehow it takes  weeks of hour nights to start raising the time in bed. Occasionally Ive gone under  hours if sleep is really difficult but if I go under too much say less than  I am just too tired to follow SRT and end up passing out early or sleeping in. Ive heard of people doing less than  hours a night in SRT but that seems for extreme cases. Since SRT actually makes you more tired at first you end up in this state of extreme exhaustion for the last few hours of the night where it is hard to do anything but stare at a tv or such making it easy to accidentally pass out. SRT is a long term thing for me. Maybe some day Ill be able to get  hours of sleep on a whim but for now it seems that either I do SRT or my sleep gets out of control.,insomnia,coz3fnb,1,t5_2qh3g

4017564,0,t3_36405j,I did one when I was  about  yeaars ago but never got the results. It was an awkward experience. Youre completely hooked up to all these wires and someone can see and hear everything you do. If you have to use the restroom you have to call them in to come unhook you. The room you are in is cold and feels almost like a prison cell. The bed is comfy but you cant have ANYTHING from the outside world. We were allowed to bring some movies but they wouldnt let us watch them after pm or so and we were pretty much forced to go to sleep even though I wasnt tired. I stayed up for a few hours and eventually fell asleep but was so uncomfortable that I never actually got a good nights sleep. The issues I normally have were completely different because I had so much anxiety over what was happening. A hurricane hit a few days after it was done and they lost everything but the main doctor was pretty much like Yep you have insomnia. Cool...thanks?

6672981,0,t1_d06dzt9,No recovery from it yet. I was prescribed zopiclone from my doctor which has been tremendous in helping me sleep. The first night I took it it was incredibly weird. I could feel my mind working against me with the constant anxiety and awareness to thinking  and it took a while for the drug to kick in due to this but I felt my body slowly fall into unconsciousness eventually. I proceeded to take it for  days until friday night where I let myself naturally fall asleep which took   hours  around am.Then I began to take the drug against MondayFriday to help me sleep and to try to get back into a regular sleep rhythm. On the weekend I again didnt touch the stuff as to not become reliant on it. Come last night I decided not to take it and just to let myself fall asleep naturally. Which was going fine until I again became aware of my thinking? Its hard to explain but I believe this is the root of my insomnia I become aware of my thoughts as I slowly drift asleep and I start to consciously dictate my thoughts which brings my brain out of that natural drowsy state and makes me feel awake. I have found luck in sleeping with a TV on as odd as it sounds. I basically turn the brightness down so its relatively dim get cozy and let the soft voices of south park marathons lull me into sleep. I think what happens here is my brain becomes focused on the sound of voices and my thoughts revolve around focusing on that which prevents my brain from flipping between  things at once. The biggest issue is on good nights where it takes ish minutes to fall asleep I dont remember why or how I fell asleep so easily the next day. But on nights where I am unsuccessful at falling asleep I focus on this and it creates a cycle where I cant sleep. The gym helps a lot  I recommend you starting spending  hours a week in the gym and walking regularly  minutes a day. ,insomnia,d09jlca,1,t5_2qh3g

Oh man the other night after about mg of Melatonin I dreamed this tiny stone alligator statue my wife brought home started to move and turned into a real alligator the size of a lizard and disappeared into our house and then we noticed that we had all these really really tiny baby alligators on the floor and I was squashing them in my bare feet but not fast enough and they were all growing really quickly into full size gators...whooo wee that was some dream...but anyway!But as for getting me to sleep or helping me stay asleep...it does nothing.You might try glycine or ltheanine and see if they help.Prescriptionwise Zopiclone is still the best in limited runs being sure to alternate off it on a regular basis and not stay on it indefinitely.,insomnia,d7c80x4,1,t5_2qh3g
8872004,0,t3_51ox85,In addition to the other comments you should try to start a routine like getting up the same time and going to be the same time. Ive heard a sleep researcher say that the most important thing about sleep is listening to your body. Even though you havent slept in  days your body will eventually be tired enough for you to sleep and when that occurs try your best not to think about sleep or sleeping. Think of things that will calm you down. Make sure your room is dark enough. Also try not to take naps during the day because it will take away your sense of wanting to sleep at night. Dont exercise before bed because your adrenaline will be too excitatory in your system and prevents you from sleeping. Make sure your bedroom is only associated with sleep or at least your bed and not any other entertainment. Our brain is use to conditioning. So if you do activities on your bed then your brain will understand that the bed is more than for sleeping. Being exposed to daily sunlight is extremely important as it will help keep your circadian rhythm going. Even on really cloudy days the light exposure from outside is much more intense than an very well lit room. The key thing here is really to relax when you go to bed and exercise or do things that will make you tired during the day. And when you still cant sleep on your bed you need to get out of bed and do something like reading and such until you feel like you want to go to bed again. Staying awake in your bed doesnt help because of conditioning e.g. your brain associating with being restless on bed. I hope some things will help you out!! ,insomnia,d7eafyl,1,t5_2qh3g

9356209,0,t3_58mkk1,The problem with frustration is that it compounds into itself. Lying in bed doesnt allow for any release of that stressanxiety. When youre feeling like theres no hope just remember that sleep is sleep. You can always catch up on sleep throughout the day or the next night. I think most of the time people say meditationreadingwhatever works best but that just makes sleep more of a ritual. IMO when you ritualize something it causes anxiety of expectation.Of course this doesnt apply to everyone. Making less a big deal of sleep improved my sleep a ton!I hope my perspective helps and I hope your sleep improves. ,insomnia,d91yti2,2,t5_2qh3g

10019155,0,t3_5j473l,Am in the same boat! Sleep problems started before college amp its been  years of ambien. Mother also uses the drug. Its very habit forming I kept asking for refills intending to someday soon get off of them. Hard when you have so many other things going on!  weeks ago I realized I needed to take my full mg since taking half the pill no longer worked. Then even the full dose wasnt putting me to sleep! Ambien loses effectiveness more often than not so if your relatives seem to have no issues using it long term then they may have less trouble falling asleep without it as well. Since Ambien can start to loose effectiveness it is meant to be a band aid to get back to a regular sleep schedule in combination with proper bed time habits nutrition stress management and exercise. The problem is that many people myself included get MUCH needed relief from the drug and forget to do those other things! Ive found that being so busy with school has sometimes tired me out enough to fall asleep without it if I get to the point of exhaustion. If you start to taper take it slow. You body is used to a drug putting you to sleep without needing to relax. Try taking melatonin on top of it while you taper. Figure out things that make you sleepyrelaxed and get in a habit of doing them while you taper. Once you get to a low dose say . you could try alternating nights and taking diphenhydramineunisom over the counter the nights you dont take it. After that you can try going a night without anything! For people with insomnia that have managed to form good sleep habits having ambien around can be comforting just for the rough nights. Im interested to hear what ends up working for you! Also ask your doctor what heshe recommends. Good luck!,insomnia,dbdivsd,2,t5_2qh3g

10832206,0,t1_ddx8s87,I had this really intense existential anxiety and its completely possible that I havent been anxiety free since then. The first wave of anxiety never bothered my sleeping just sort of consumed my thoughts and disturbed me in a more philosophical sense than anything else. The second wave of anxiety happened after the existential feeling of dread left and was basically the sort of obsession with sickness  impending sense of doom or death that you would characterize with health anxiety. The insomnia developed AFTER much of my health anxiety started to disappear medical test results showed that I was worried about nothing. I dont think about my health NEARLY as much so Im not sure where the insomnia is coming from.Ill admit ever since the existential panic  weeks ago I havent been as socially active as I once was and thats entirely on me. I dont ever feel nervous in social situations I just lost the motivation to go out and socialize out of this irrational negativity.I was planning on leaving my job but after the existential episode I decided to leave my job a few months earlier than planned and have since been unemployed for the last two weeks. I think that was a mistake as work at least distracted me and to some extant mentally stimulated  exhausted me. I having nothing else in my life causing stress and believe this is all rooted in me delving deeper into the subject of philosophy months ago. This is a VERY atypical reaction to the subject and even though I feel like I have gotten over whatever troubled me at first the insomnia seems to be the last and only remaining effect of all of this.,insomnia,ddx9krz,1,t5_2qh3g
10876074,0,t3_5v9wud,Try stimulus control therapy.  Its preferably done without medication. The most important points  only go to bed when you are sleepy eyes dropping head nodding etc wake up at the same time every day regardless of how much you slept the previous night and NO NAPS this has been the hardest part for me.  I like you used to sleep  hours and for the last  months have been getting only  each night.  Ive found that this non drug approach works really well and is a better long term solution. My trouble has just been following the rules.  If you do it expect the first few nights to a week to not sleep much.  Eventually your sleep will go up though as your brain realizes this new routine your homeostatic drive will strengthen and your conditioned arousal to the bed will go down. Sleep restriction therapy works in a similar manner but Ive found that its easier to follow this therapy and its more simplified  although they are often done in conjunction.  Your bed times will change each night typically during this therapy as your sleep urges gradually increase just try to make sure they arent too far apart more than  min unless you are really really sleepy.  If you can get through the first week to two weeks of this therapy you will be well on your way to your old sleeping ability.Additionally try to get some daily exercise. Its proven to help but be consistent with it and try to get some each day. Walking works well for those with insomnia who might not be able to go all out...you can do it for long periods.
