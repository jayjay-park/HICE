Im wondering if he DID have an eating disorder and in any case could his weight have affected his psychological wellbeing andor influenced his actions? Could he have been healthy at that weight and for how long? So many questions! You dont need to answer them just thinking out loud!. Its late here so Im off to bed. So glad youre joining us on the sub! ,EatingDisorderHope,cu99w0w,1,t5_2t1vv
