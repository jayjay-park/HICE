10506924,0,t3_5qgnv1,Do you like porridgeoatmeal? oats are very cheap. i like adding choppedpureed fruit like bananaapplepearpumpkin. You can add things like red lentils or other grains too if you like. I personally prefer to use water instead of plant based milks in my oats too and I add flax to make it thick.Couscous also cooks really quickly and I think is cheaper than rice in my local supermarket! It works well hot or cold.,EatCheapAndVegan,dcz2klz,3,t5_35y3z
