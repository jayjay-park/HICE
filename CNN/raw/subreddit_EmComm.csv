4678786,0,t1_ctka6ke,gt  I dont see the need to have multiple weekly nets and constant required training for something that is based on volunteers.Over training is a thing.  But you do want heatbeat checks.  Just meetings or nets to see whos still willing to be active.Also if you get a solid group of ppl together who advertise themselves as being able to help the community with local parades or bike rides or what not for COMMS only that gives you practice for when an emergency comes up.The thing is if you dont practice you wont be prepared when it happens.I fully agree the guys who put the lights on for no reason and wear policemilitary style uniforms and such.  Just no.If you have a group you are affiliated with and they have tshirt great wear it.  Wear a reflective vest if youll be out in traffic or the group you are supporting requires it.  If youll be in the heat a camelbak makes sense.  But not if youre inside w ac amp a fountain.I guess my point you adjust to the situation you are supporting. Sure have it all in your car. But only take out what is needed.,EmComm,ctkb4ss,1,t5_39bgv
