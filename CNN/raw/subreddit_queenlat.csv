Wave interference is strong when the paths taken by all of the interfering waves differ by less than the coherence length. A wave with a longer coherence length is closer to a perfect sinusoidal wave.The cause of all centripetal self organizing forces coherence  The working definitions for coherence range from the tangible to the abstract from the literal to the figurative from the cosmic to the cosmetic. This article incorporatespublic domain material from the General Services Administration document Federal Standard C in support of MILSTD.
