Theres just one thing I want to nitpick on and its not your fault for including it since it says it plain as day in the manga.I know theres a lot of FTL claims in regards mainly to Star Platinum and the other strong melee stands and it even says it in the rundown of Star Platinum you linked but I feel like this is way way overstated. For one thing a stand punching at FTL speeds would be so ludicously more powerful than anything they are shown to be capable of. Theres also the fact that Crazy Diamond is given a punching speed of around  kmhr which is enough to match Star Platinum sans time stop. And if Star Platinum were truly FTL it would have absolutely no problem batting the timestopped knives out of the way in a fraction of a fraction of a millisecond in the DIOs World fight.,respectthreads,cnxw6xn,3,t5_2yfqs

Sure he cant really be take out some people who have to rely on just physical strength IE Hulk but he doesnt have any offense to match it. Not to mention that he can be hurt by enemies who have shown to hit intangible enemies IE Magneto and the likes also  sure that he has no mental resistance feats so telepaths would be effective as well unless Im missing something and Manhattans intangibility is something special pretty sure its not. It wouldnt be too crazy to say that a competent telepath or matter manipulator can take him out. He didnt really die to Nitro as he was clearly regenerating just burned down to his skeleton.

He fired a single shot at the High Chaplain aiming low aiming to wound to slow him down. But he might well have called out his intentions in a shout. Astorath swept his blade aside and intercepted the bolt midflight with a crack of sound the round blasting harmlessly into the dirt.

It seems like you wouldnt even reread or check the respect thread before commenting on the fight and youre concerned about time. So if you had a change log you would have to have a link in the op post to the change log that would then link back up to the prompt with the new feats or double post the feats which you still wouldnt know about until you went in to the respect thread and had to work through to find the new information anyways.

Thingscreaked radiations played and hazy EM indications suggested the ships engines and major systemswere back on line. The heat making its way through the drones body dissipated slowly leaving italive but still crippled and incapable of movement or action. It would take it days to bootstrap theroutines that would even start to replace the mechanisms that would construct the selfrepair nanounits.That seemed quite funny too. The vessel made noises and signals like it was moving off throughspace again. Meanwhile the thing in the drones real mind went on raging. It was like living with anoisy neighbour or having a headache thought the drone. It went on waiting.Eventually a heavy maintenance unit about the size of a human torso and escorted by a trio ofsmall selfmotivated effector sidearms appeared at the far end of the vertical companionway above itand floated down through the currents of climbing gas until they were directly over the smallpocked smoking and splintered casing of the drone. The effector weapons aim had stayed lockedonto the drone the whole way down.Then one of the guns powered up and fired at the small machine.Shit. Bit summary dammit . . . the drone had time to think.But the effector was powered only enough to provide a twoway communication channel. Hello? said the maintenance unit through the gun. Hello yourself. The other machine is gone. I know my twin. Snapped. Displaced. Get thrown a long way by one of those big Displace Podssomething that small. Oneoff coordinates too. Never find itThe drone knew it was babbling its electronic mind was probably under effector incursion but toodamn stupid even to know it and so gibbering as a side effect but it couldnt stop itself Yep totally gone. Entity overboard. Onethrow XYZs. Never find it. No point in even looking forit. Unless you want me to step into the breach too of course Id go take a squint if you like if thepods still up for it personally it wouldnt be too much trouble . . . Did you mean all that to happen?The drone thought about lying but now it could feel the effector weapon in its mind and knew thatnot only the weapon and the maintenance drone but the ship and whatever had taken over all of themcould see it was thinking about lying . . . so feeling that it was itself again but knowing it had nodefences left wearily it said Yes.They go on talking for a bit until the Drones mind gets pulled into the ExcessionPeace Makes Plentys core.,respectthreads,dbfvyr4,1,t5_2yfqs
