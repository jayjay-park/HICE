It doesnt really look anything like a dogs face meaning that if you showed it out of context to  people none of them would say it was a dog. Also if you showed it to  people none of them would say it was reminiscent of code syntax. It doesnt look like anything other than a weird shape. The text alone looks much better.

The WM is a little hard to make out unless you know what youre looking for.  It might be interesting to try to put WILL and MISTER on the right side opposite the DAT.  Put them on top of each other and half the height so they end up matching the DAT size.  Expand the WILL to match the MISTER so they make a block about the same size as DAT. I dont like that the W and M have a nice wide diagonal gap while the gap between the W and M is very skinny.  Widen the horizontal gap to match the gap in the letters.Otherwise it looks very cool.

7209288,0,t3_4e5jxs,Hi there. None of this is bad and some of them are good and usable but I dont see many ideas I just see you moving the same two or three elements around in different configurations. I think you should step back and think more macro. Come up with the general concept your trying to convey. The name implies an enormous amount of fencing is that something your client provides? Do they stock different fencing or just this pointed board fencing you are using over and over? Do they install the fence or are they just a supplier? Commercial or residential applications? Is it a small business or a big company. What kind of values do you they have? The logo cant share all this information only the most important bits your job as the designer is to determine which bits those are.For example take the one near the bottom middle of the page with  examples where acres is inside and at the bottom of the boards. This version starts to get at something. There is a bit of a sense of scale of bigness what if you exaggerated that a little more? Is bigness even important? I am not advocating for this one necessarily its just an example of a logo starting to convey some additional meaning.From these samples you have more than sufficient skill to make the logo. I would spend more time to find an idea worthy of the execution.Hope this helps a little. Good luck.,Logo_Critique,d1xn15c,1,t5_2soc0

10045836,0,t3_5jkajs,Oh man this is really nice. It has a distinctunique feel and incorporates the subject and geography well idk if your intention was to make them look like mountains but its great. I get the feeling of solidarity and conviction in the business. Only thing Im iffy about is the DOWN being a light font I think it could do well to match the style as PLOWING. Good work!,Logo_Critique,dbgzxza,2,t5_2soc0
10120554,0,t1_dbq1bik,The angles are intentional. Originally all the words including .com were on one blue square. But i wanted to separate .com and so I justified .com to the right then decided to git it its own blue square. Then I introduced the angles in order to balance the layout.  The problem I now see with the angles is that I showed it to someone and they thought I was trying to create a pop out d effect. That is not my intention. I was thinking in D the whole time.I find it difficult to fit all the words into a logo so I am thinknig of just creating a shape more like a symbol. and just writing losangelescoder.com at the bottom.,Logo_Critique,dbqprqj,1,t5_2soc0
10145275,0,t3_5l8qh1,I feel youre trying to cram in too many concepts try removing one or two and seeing what still works as well ,Logo_Critique,dbtxlfw,2,t5_2soc0
10331886,0,t3_5nxoa7,I suggest removing the last blue wave. And I see right under the S that flat part bothers me. I would make that round and then mess with the green wave to match the roundness when you fix the flat part. Everything else is fine tho,Logo_Critique,dcf6dkt,2,t5_2soc0
10438842,0,t3_5phsd6,IMO you should try to turn the leaf  it look like its falling and it give a negative image of the restaurant.  What kind of restaurant is it? Edit mistake,Logo_Critique,dcrbflc,3,t5_2soc0
10522342,0,t3_5qnfyr,I like how its simple and still carries out the meaning very well even without the text. Not big fan of the typography. Even though Im big fan of slim fonts I think that is a trend that wont last too long and in a logo something more bold would work better. ,Logo_Critique,dd0tkj9,1,t5_2soc0

10653742,0,t3_5sgfdt,Too many mountainscolours. The U is too much like a V.Colours are nice though Id play around with the mountains and make a few different samples. I understand the font you are going for but its hard to get past the U.,Logo_Critique,ddeunyz,3,t5_2soc0
10760259,0,t3_5txqhm,I think the bottom ones have the most personality. Top ones look like guitars. Keys are distracting. Explore bounding shapes and different thicknesses. Im out of practice with logo design but I can tell the bottom ones have potential. ,Logo_Critique,ddpuao7,3,t5_2soc0
10768638,0,t1_ddqncix,I like that a lot actually! Have you tried putting black outlines around the wings too? That was what I was getting at  and may help make it a bit more cohesive!DEFINITELY think the shading is improving ,Logo_Critique,ddqpees,1,t5_2soc0

11006330,0,t1_defgdl4,Thank you thats solid advice.  I like the one you did I am looking to have a contrast of ohms being heavychunky and the architects lighter and wider. Do you suggest any lighter font that would go well with the original ArkzidenzGrotesk super ?,Logo_Critique,defjbts,1,t5_2soc0
11282472,0,t3_61059a,I would mess around with the negative space. Right now theres two gaps between the Z letter that stand out.,Logo_Critique,dfaunxj,1,t5_2soc0
11300083,0,t1_dfcsuz6,I think  shadows is fine  it really all comes down to subjective opinion. In my opinion I think  shadows is a little distracting. ,Logo_Critique,dfcuix1,2,t5_2soc0
11510933,0,t3_649pep,Look around your town. Ive done four logos so far in maybe a two month span but then again I just see someone on Facebook page of my town who has a business. I look further into that business. Then after I research I approach them over messenger but Id suggest going to the person just Im lazy. Talk to them say hey I see you have or dont have a logo. Would you like me to make you one or revise the one you had because heres what Id do differently and based off successful businesses this is the route youll want to go. Show them you not only know how to design but also that you know whats best for their company. I get away with only  per logo but come up with prices for logos. Then add ons like brochures and business cards. Perhaps find a connect for printing so that way you can also provide the product for the person. Just make sure to of course incorporate your costs to make sure you get profit in your pricing. Theres more to it but literally just do research and walk in and explain why youre offering your services. Another package you can do is branding. Make them an entire package shirts cards logo brochures etc. its the first appearance that matters so be professional. Also make yourself business cards and drop a few off at local shops!Hope that helps.,Logo_Critique,dg0rl0t,3,t5_2soc0
