I can get out of the throw by jumping but then he does an overhead kick move that moves forward a ton and catches my jump.  Or he does the stomp that catches my prejump it seems like and I cannot poke him out of it my far S with sword is the only thing that reaches him and definitely doesnt hit in time.So I get pushed to the corner and get thrown stomped or the kick catches my attempted jump out then I eat a ton of damage.

7246334,0,t3_4ent1j,For what its worth heres my opinion. Fighting games regardless of which one you choose will always take a lot of time and dedication. Find one that makes you want to learn it the most which one has the best looking characters in your opinion at a high level of play which looks more awesome because population size isnt something that really matters in my opinion. For example if you do chose Xrd youll probably need to find a group of people to play with in your area if you choose SFV youll be able to play online but eventually youll have to find people in your area anyways same with MKX everything in fighting games leads to offline play eventually. Another way to look at it is which game do I want to spend my time losing at? Because thats how youre going to be spending your first month or so lol.I will say this though Xrd is the hardest game on the list youve mentioned so be ready to struggle for some of the best fun youve had in your life.

10011616,0,t3_5j1anj,Hey OP fellow scrub here. I just recently got into fighting games too. I picked up Street Fighter and have been playing that a ton and I hadhave the same problem. Here are some tips that I got early on that I think helped me a lot. Im still scrubbing it in rookie or bronze on SFV though and Ive never played a GG match online so Im probably talking out my ass and dont know anything.. Most combos can be broken into smaller pieces so try and practice just a chunk of it. From SFV I know some stuff only combos out of other moves though so I dont know if thats possible in GG.. Try some other characters because a lot of the motions are the same and it makes it less redundant. Most characters have a launcher into an air combo so see if any of those are doable. I think just practicing in general will help with the muscle memory. I struggled a lot with the  motion a lot when I first started but so many characters use it I think I just finally got it. I still cant do it on reaction though in a match but I can do it in trials pretty consistently.. Always have the key display on when practicing. If you mess up look at it the inputs and focus on correcting that. I coach tennis in real life and Ill often have kids practice their strokes without hitting a ball and in slow motion just to get it down. If you see youre hitting too many buttons maybe try going through the the combo slowly and just touch the buttons so you practice the order. That helps me  when I practice.. I dont know how much this applies to GG but in SFV I struggled a lot with some combos because you have to do them so quickly. I figured out some of the buttons dont change with direction so sometimes you can be holding forward for the DP motion while you hit fierce heavy slash in GG? that way you already have a third of the input entered. That might help with entering combos if speed is an issue. I still cant DP from light kicks though. Even if you and I dont want to hear it I think some of the combo stuff really is git gud aka play more to get muscle memory.. Breathe. One of my biggest struggles is in matches I tense up and start doing random stuff on the stick. I can do a combo  times in trials but only  times in matches. If I dont panic it gets better but I just get so excited that after I touch the other player Ill do the qcf motion and let go of the joy stick all together and forget to hold down for a crouching punch.I hope these help are the type of advice youre looking for but again Im a scrub and maybe I have no idea what Im talking about.  ,Guiltygear,dbcjj83,5,t5_2tiga

10321322,0,t1_dcaz18d,Work on your throw game.use of the Roman cancel system needs work. You prc a stun edge when you could have yrc and overall it felt like the Roman cancel system felt under utilized or just not inspired in its use. Especially against sol u shouldnt be eating gv when you have meter to yrc stun edge. Dont eat bandit bringer. Ideally u can jump in block and then grab if its pradictably placed like at the end of a block string. If you cant manage that try blitz shielding it its an easier option but its less advantageous as they can blitz back.,Guiltygear,dcdz8o6,2,t5_2tiga

They did say as much theyre adjusting things with her playstyle i reckon if they change too much theyll come back and not like what they did. on the flip side changes can also attract new players to a character. ,Guiltygear,dchsbqg,1,t5_2tiga
10358279,0,t1_dchz1l9,Keep in mind throws will only work if theyre within throw range. If you input a throw and theyre out of range youll most likely eat a counterhit and take a lot of damage. Only attempt them if youre pretty sure itll work like if theyre running into your knocked down body like in street fighter. Most of the time its safest to just block.,Guiltygear,dci66ps,2,t5_2tiga

10422797,0,t1_dcnwo8u,I beg to differ. At least prior to . the only NA Elphelt threat before he moved on to JackO was Lost Soul when he was active in the first half of . Every other NA Elphelt IMO was not up to his level with how consistent his setups and confirms were. Hell people still HAD to lab antiElphelt tech if they wanted to go deep in some regionalsmajors were an Elph who knew shotgun pressure could cheese them out. If the nerfs stay then its fitting as its more normalization on her end. But I doubt players like NerdJosh Hotashi and others who have scummed with her since SIGN are looking to move on completely. ,Guiltygear,dcphrm1,2,t5_2tiga

10526172,0,t3_5q4wyg,I just started playing and am having a great time but I have a few questions Id appreciate having answered. Maining Sin.. Hows meter generation in this game? How much is it normal to get in a round if Im playing properly? Wondering how to start thinking of meter management.. How much damage off a combo is enough? Im not gonna go for anything optimal while Im still trying to get a hang of how this game plays but would like to learn some combos that are decent at beginner level.. Two parter since Im struggling with the wakeup reversal tutorial Is there much of an input buffer in this game?  And how can I tell I Im too early or late? I dont think my problem is with doing the motion just the timing.,Guiltygear,dd198f4,2,t5_2tiga

I dont feel as lost as I did when I first started playing Street Fighter probably well because Ive played Street Fighter. Back then nothing made sense to me I could never get any combos in a real match and I was often just panicmashing buttons.

11790826,0,t3_683m0y,For reference I played Nu and Lambda in the CS series from BBCT through CPEX. Ive not played Central Fiction mostly on account of not having other local Blazblue players anymore.I currently play Venom in Xrd but would hesitate to recommend him based on your criteria there are a lot of setups to learn. Id probably recommend Axl for fairly simple straightforward zoning with good pokes with Faust being secondary.That said I recommend doing every characters combo trials and picking whatever seems fun  you may find you prefer something else in Guilty Gear as the two series are quite different from one another. For example in spite of being a Nu player in Blazblue the first GG character that really clicked for me was Millia and though both characters can alter their jump arcs with projectiles in ways most characters cant they are almost nothing alike overall.PS Combo execution is almost all practice  I used to think I didnt have the dexterity to play technical characters either then I learned an extended Accent Core Ino combo. It takes a lot of time and effort but you absolutely can do it.,Guiltygear,dgwj31i,2,t5_2tiga
