6700671,0,t3_47aoaj,Name of the Wind by Patrick RothfussI have stolen princesses back from sleeping barrow kings. I burned down the town of Trebon. I have spent the night with Felurian and left with both my sanity and my life. I was expelled from the University at a younger age than most people are allowed in. I tread paths by moonlight that others fear to speak of during day. I have talked to Gods loved women and written songs that make the minstrels weep. You may have heard of me. ,SlytherinBookClub,d0ceoet,1,t5_39pal
