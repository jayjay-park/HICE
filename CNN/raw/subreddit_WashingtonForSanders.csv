5368297,0,t1_cvthfok,Agreed. Her actions are no different than those of politicians in North Dakota taking oil money campaign contributions. The onslaught of the whataboutists on this page sickens me.  But what about that one small good thing she did here or there?  Yeah.  Well Bill Clinton did a few small good things too but if I could go back and NOT vote for him and nullify NAFTA the Telecommunications Act of  and the Gramm Leach Bliley Act of  youre damned skippy I would.  Its made me sick for years.  Ill never vote Patty again.,WashingtonForSanders,cvxuz78,2,t5_3812g

6716767,0,t1_d0dt6am,I ran for election to become my precinct committee person.  As a precinct committee person.  I ran the caucus for my precinct.  And participated in the Legislative District Caucus which will take place Sunday April  .  It was really interesting.  I got an opportunity to really get to know what government was all about.  Ive voted on the platform that will was brought up at the County Convention which is Sunday May  .  It was my viewpoint that I had maxed out my stress levels and had to back off and let others do what I wasnt prepared to do.  I look back on it and it was an excellent experience.  If I was interested in politics more.  I wouldve gone even further.  Try to contact a PCO that is more experience than you and ask them questions.  Its been way too long for me to be able to answer all the questions but someone thats participated in the system can give you what you need.  Go for you will find the time rewarding.,WashingtonForSanders,d0e2lj4,1,t5_3812g
6858409,0,t3_49oj4o,Are these out of state Washington residents going to vote an absentee Washington state ballot in the general election or in the presidential preference primary in May? Do they consider themselves Democrats? If the answer to these questions is yes it is important they caucus.Now as students their work is to be attending classes. They absolutely have a work related reason to fill out the surrogate affidavit form.Attending a caucus in person is the best and is preferred but if that is not possible the surrogate affidavit form is available.  You should have a reason for using it but the party is not trying to disenfranchise voters by restricting access to the caucus.,WashingtonForSanders,d0tpk08,4,t5_3812g

So if you have to work you would need to have submitted the affidavit by yesterday. I wish it were so but you dont have any legal ability to get the day off. ,WashingtonForSanders,d15vbcu,4,t5_3812g

7291391,0,t3_4f9aw3,WA is a primary state...we do both caucuses and primaries. The state Democratic Party has chosen to caucus the Republicans do primaries and the Party set the rules for how caucuses are run.I expect the SoS can influence the process but doesnt have the authority to change it directly. Other caucus states CO NV MN are introducing bills to switch to primaries. Most likely that effort needs to be initiated by a legislator in WA too. Or maybe it could be done by referendum. Lobbying the WSDP might also have an effect. ,WashingtonForSanders,d26zd2r,14,t5_3812g

I dont know why we need a Democrat SOS to have a primary though especially since the Republican SOS has been pushing for us to have one.

7516289,0,t1_d2vh313,Voting against a candidate in the other party is only an issue when the parties dont caucus at the same time or when one uses a caucus and one uses a primary to vote. Washington has both of these issues.If they either both caucussed at the same timedate or they both used a primary which is the better more representative option especially with our mailin ballots then nobody can vote for both sides. Sure they could still vote against a candidate in the other party but then they give up their vote for their own party.The only downside would be when theres a situation like there is now where Trump is the only candidate for the GOP so republicans have no reason to not vote on the democratic side. But considering how many republicans hate trump and wont vote for him is that a bad thing?Its complicated. But right now someone can go Caucus for dems and then vote for reps in their primary. Timing is an issue here since the GOP already has their winner but the only way to fix that is to have a nationwide primary voting day which I cant see happening. You could also have closed primaries but I honestly think that that creates more issues with proper representation than it solves. Weve seen that with states that fucked people over with their closed caucuses.Its complicated ,WashingtonForSanders,d2wkcay,1,t5_3812g
