Be prepared to wait. not every bus will let you on with him especially if he is big eventually youll find one but it might not be the first bus so hope you arent in a hurry. Secondly especially if he is big youll probably pay for an extra passenger. Whenever i have taken him in a taxi or a tuktukmotito my dog has always been charged as a passenger. you might be better off hitchhiking in the back of a truck. Pay a few cords here or there and you and your dog can hang out in the back of a truck. ,centralamerica,cocqsdh,1,t5_2umm6
