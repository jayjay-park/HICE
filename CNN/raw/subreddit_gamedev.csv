Im also not terribly good at programming monster AI so Ive been borrowing ideas from the classics. I just finished up the rough level layout so Im going to make one more pass with decorations monsters and platforming challenges.gtWhat are you going to draw from Dark Souls? Boss design?Everything I can! The primary stuff would be the level design  branching paths shortcuts sequence breaking revisiting previous locations hiddendestructible walls. The whole first level will be entirely skippable as long as you know the secret which is shown to you after beating the first boss so that on subsequent play throughs you can skip it. Unforgiving challenging but fair gameplay. This is challenging but Ive got a few ideas on how to make it work. Im dont care for twitch combatmovement Im not good at either so Im hoping it ends up feeling methodical and thoughtful rather than all about timing and reflexes. Hopefully it doesnt end up feeling sluggish and frustrating. Lose your currencyexperiencesomething else when you die. Direct ripoff of the dark souls mechanic but I think it gives the exact right amount of high stakes feeling.Id love to have bosses as epic as Dark Souls but Im finding it quite challenging in only  dimensions.

The enemies were maybe a bit too aggressive if I was moving in the same direction they appeared it was often too late to react.Having a goal to move towards is definitely something thats lacking now.

122173,0,t1_cerw1v6,Congrats on making your first game! Thats definitely a huge milestone.Despite the slick UI the game is still completely confusing. That said I eventually understood the core mechanic of the game and I like it! Deploy these vehiclethingies at the right direction at the right time to get the right pattern. But the interface being so abstract doesnt help me understand that at all. Especially the fact that those green things were called Actions instead of... I dont know... green moveyshape thingamabob... objects?My critique your game might be too abstract might be too abstract. Indulge me as I give an example of...How I might redesign your game keeping the core mechanic the sameLevel One Tanks move stepbystepI see a x grid like your first level! and on the first square theres a green tank facing right. Immediately from what I know about tanks I know that thing can move to the right. as opposed to abstract green shapes And maybe the location is a battlefield or something.In the bottom of the screen theres a small paper map telling me what position the tanks must take. In your current game I have to toggle onoff the goal position. The goal should be immediately apparent. The map tells me to get that tank on the th square of the grid.Next to that map I have a radio control that has a Big Red Button and a number counter that starts at . theres also a smaller reset button somewhere I press the Big Red Button. I see radio signals fly and the tank responds moving one step forward. The counter increments to . I press the button again. . Again. . Again. . The tank is now at the end of the grid.Success! Level complete.Level Two Deploy Tanks.Another level except... theres no tanks here! Yet my map still says to get a tank to the rightmost square. Just the same x grid except the first square has a circular metal base clearly labeled Deploy Tank. Hm... I click that Deploy Tank Zone.A little screen pops up! All in one screen it asks me  What direction the tank faces showing images of tanks facing in different directions and  When to deploy it. showing a counter starting at  with a  and  button to change it. I tell it DEPLOY A TANK FACING RIGHT AT STEP . Now Id like to point out this part of your games UI was the weirdest part. Select an action although I still wasnt sure what that was... then click some green star? Then green shapes?... And then theres this weird numpad selector where the increment button is in the middle and I cant go back to previous numbers... And then its all queued in this sidebar on the right.Now I can press The Big Red Button. The Deploy Zone receives a radio signal and... woah! The metal base opens up and a new tank comes out from the ground. Awesome. I press the Big Red Button again and this time the tank gets the signal and moves forward. Do this again and again and the tank is finally at the end it fits the pattern on my map I win.Success! Level complete.Level Three CrossingIts a  shaped grid with one deploy zone at the top and another on the left. The map tells you that you need one tank at the bottom one at the right. Easy. You just deploy them in different directions and at different times to make sure they dont collide. At this point I just realized  maybe the counter should count DOWN rather than up. And once you hit zero you cant send any more radio signals. This way you can show amp enforce the limitedsteps requirement.If a good story is show dont tell... then a good game tutorial is do dont show.Whoo that was a long but fun! review and critique with concrete suggestions. Of course you dont have to use tanks. Tanks were just the first thing I thought of that moves mostly forward in limited bursts. Those three levels have established the core mechanics and now youre free to expand on them! Colliding tanks different coloured tanks anything you please.Thank you Angler for giving Friday Feedback on my dystopian puzzle game Nothing To Hide!,gamedev,cescd6h,2,t5_2qi0a
122820,0,t3_1vhvvp,Honorificabilitudinitatibus working titleStill plugging along on my little pirate game.  Things are finally going pretty well and progress is being made.  Hoping to have a very early playable alpha in the coming weeks.  Heres a screenshot The game is loosely inspired by games like FTL with a dash of Sid Meiers Pirates.  Its a game where you are the pirate captain of a ship or even a fleet of ships in time.  Most gameplay is split between two main modes.  One mode when the ship is at sea but not in battle shows an interactive map.    image from when i was working on island generation for the world  map.  You do most of your ship  crew management from that screen.  While sailing you may run into other ships and can attack or be attacked which leads to battle.  The first screenshot shows a build of a battle scene.  Its turn based you give movement and weapon commands to each of the ships in your fleet and click end turn.  Once the turn ends all the commands are carried out in real time similar to Mech Warrior Tactics i think but i havent played that.   You can see the player aiming the Port Broadside Cannon weapons group in the image.       One last old shot i always liked,gamedev,cesf10a,15,t5_2qi0a
122986,0,t3_1vhvvp,Luminux  Action Puzzler for Mobile and Free in Web Player iOS Android Windows Phone Web PlayerWe have a Demo available right here Unity Web Player DemoAnd we just had a Feedback Friday post here Game Trailer PremiseHello there! Luminux is an actionbased puzzle game that marks a return to game development for myself and my friends. The premise of the game is simple. By sliding blocks around which in turn slide other blocks around you attempt to keep the board from filling up. While sliding  blocks of the same color into a straight line is enough to destroy them earning proper points requires creating thinking in order to line the blocks up so that multiple rows will be destroyed at once.A prototype of this game won first place in a Microsofthosted coding competition prompting us to create a fully fleshed out and polished version for a true release!New Stuff!Unfortunately we havent had that many new things that are screen noticeable. Following advice from our previous screenshot saturday thread we reduced the amount of glow that we were using and added a form of musical progression to the game.Perhaps one of the major changes weve performed in changing the block spawning animation. originally I wanted the blocks to be hollow while spawning to make it very clear that the block was not yet finished spawning. While fixing a bug I ended up filling in the spawning blocks again. When I played with it on I was surprised by how much better the game looked! Compare the differences yourselfCurrent Before Also this week we completed our game over animation. Previously it would simply shoot you to the gameover screen. Now it shouts Cosmic Meltdown! at you My Question to YouAfter looking at the Current vs Before pictures above which do you prefer? I should think that almost all choices should point to the Current version but it doesnt hurt to be sure.Special Thanks for Recent Feedbackudavidloqheart For convincing us to reduce the amount of fuzziness and blurriness.uToastieRepublic Engauge For convincing us to add a form of musical progression to the game. We still plan on adding some audiovisual connected components via the background such as it pulsing to the beat but havent gotten there yet.On Contest Mode I love it.

155228,0,t3_1vuhyo,Questionnaires might not be a good way to measure something like this as they tend to be subjective of the author. I dont think I can truly give you an answer to this question but I can tell you what I would define as fun.First off the technology cant be overly complex. It has to be intuitive and easy for me to pick up. The less time I spend learning and mastering the technology is more time spent experiencing it. Now some complexity can add some wow and surprise factors like wow I didnt know it could do that but it cant be overloading where I am like ok I have to use this to do this for this and this for this but wait what do I have to do for this etc... At this point I just get frustrated and put down the technology in favor something else. Second the technology has to work. I would rather have it do one thing and do it well rather than just half do a bunch of things. Understandably when your breaking new ground its not going to be perfect it will have flaws. However if the technology is good enough well designed and consistent in what it does then as the consumer I am willing to work it. Then at that point its just like code refactoring find whats wrong fix it release new version rinse and repeat. Third is probably the most important and that is the rewarding factor. If I feel like using a technology is cumbersome and a chore then I am inclined to drop it really quick. However if I find myself wanting to come back and use it because it offers a unique experience then I consider it fun. After all why would I use something that I hate?Hope this helps you if not thanks for reading ,gamedev,cew41mu,2,t5_2qi0a

164513,0,t3_1vz4xg,Jake the dog has some advice for yougt is what kept all you guys going in the early years? I have been doing gamedev for maybe  years on weekends and after work. I am a full time developer and I eat and breathe code. I still consider my self a beginner. Game dev has a very steep learning curve. If you want to be successful then you need to have a great attitude. Embracing failure as a day to day activity will help you on your way. Try not to be discouraged when you feel confused that is just your brain working really hard to make sense out of something you are unfamiliar to. the more you make your brain think that way the easier and funner it gets. I tell everyone the same thing. Fail quickly. Pick up a small project get a demo going and then drop it and start something new. Maybe you will be working on something that really captures your interest and keeps you working.Good luck!EDITI missed the other questiongtwhats the best way to learn how to actually stand on my own two legs instead of running straight to a tutorial?First of all nothing is wrong tutorials. The best developer is the one that can run to google the fastest. You arent going to know every facet of game development its just too much info. Tutorials can serve as great tools of reference. After awhile things will start to stick just give it time. If you want to really push yourself then learn the basics of whatever technology you are using. learn the core components and how they interact. then infer how the rest of the stack works together. If you are sharp on the basics tutorials will start to seem pointless. Hope that helps.,gamedev,cex65ar,24,t5_2qi0a

171313,0,t1_cexr6z6,Nice little Demo!  I think as far as core gameplay goes youve got a solid idea.  Heres some things I would tweakGraphicsThe superpixelated font for brown doesnt look nice. On that subject I highly recommend you change the nameand color. Brown particularly of about that shade is strongly associated with poop which is probably not the kind of first impression you want your game to make. The ingame graphics get the point across.  You could release asis or make them nicer depending on your goal for the project.TutorialI thought the tutorial was quite understandable though I think it would have been better if each section was also a very simple level. EG the first tutorial is simply the green box in a totally safe room the next room is slightly more complicated etc. ControlsThe keyboard controls were simple straightforward I felt they were appropriate. Mouse input didnt feel intuitive to me. Sometimes they moved sometimes not it wasnt clear.  I would keep the board stationary since moving it around wont really be an option on mobile. For mousetouch input I would designate one square as the control square. You can give it a little hat or something. Have movement be relative to that square. So if they tap to the left of that square all squares move left etc.  This gives the player a solid point of reference rather than trying to do some crazy guesswork related to the overall position of the squares.GameplayI think the idea for the core gameplay is solid but the difficulty for the first several levels is much too high.  This is a very common trend when developing a game.  As you get better and better the early levels feel too easy so you make them just a little harder...and soon theyre way too hard for someone who is first trying to wrap their brain around it.  I recommend evaluating your levels by number of steps the user has to get right in order to beat it.  Also try to avoid levels with death until later in the game.For the early levels I recommend only asking the player to make  calculations with no risk of death.   As they get further in increase the number of steps the puzzles require. Avoid puzzles that require a lot of calculations and involve death until higher difficulty levels as repeating a puzzle you have  solved can be frustrating. OtherI probably wouldnt pay for this game as is but I think its got the potential to be a paying app. If you want to make money off mobile inapppurchases are pretty much your only choice so youll have to implement a system that takes advantage of them. It can be simple such as the angry birds thing where you get the first  levels free but have to pay after that  seems appropriate for this game.  I definitely recommend spicing up the graphics to look sharp and casualfriendly.Good Luck!My Feedback Friday PostCheers!  Jai,gamedev,cexy1ds,2,t5_2qi0a

177041,0,t3_1w4fzo,I dont have a precise answer for you but it seems to me that there are several possibilities. It could have been one of the writers writing in any game naturally involves more than just putting together a linear series of events it means designing the whole world. More specifically I often see people in the credits of games who are credited as quest writers who I assume are responsible for rounding out the details of the smaller selfcontained story elements which may or may not be related to the overall plot. Whether or not a single object within the environment constitutes a quest is a perspective that probably changes based on the studio in question. Beyond that there are Level Designers Environment Artists their respective department leads and any number of other people who would have been involved with the creative development of that part of the world. If I had to guess how this went down Id say the most likely scenario would be something like this a midlevel designer is assigned a certain portion of the map to flesh out. She comes up with an idea for an abandoned alien spacecraft or whatever and she pitches it to her lead. The lead likes it so he runs it by the writing team and they start to flesh out some story specifics what level of technology the aliens have how long ago they crashed what caused the crash and how that would manifest itself in the game assets and anything else relevant to making the object fit seamlessly within the rest of the world. From there the artists can begin working out some concept designs and preliminary assets and the designer can begin to implement her idea into the level. Okay maybe thats not so much a most likely scenario as a best case scenario. Theres probably a ton of other bullshit backandforth that comes with anything like this but anyway you get the idea. ,gamedev,ceyll5g,5,t5_2qi0a

183801,0,t1_cez8p6e,To build off of the criticisms here I have another thing to add. You might think about doing a blog format for tutorials instead of a video. I know that videos are becoming a more popular way to do tutorials since they are easier to monetize but I think they really impair a lot of what the creators are trying to do.For something like programming tutorials it would be a lot easier on the student to have code postings broken down with explanations. Watching somebody type code doesnt really do much good as far as learning to code goes. Having it written down also will give you a better chance to edit and clarify you message without cutting together a bunch of video and audio.If you want to do videos maybe one or two about how to use eclipse would be useful but even then screen shots can often be easier to refer back to. Keep in mind that the students are trying to learn so the easier it is for them to revisit material the better. Trying to find something in a video is much more difficult than quickly searching on a page or looking for a header.,gamedev,cezdeg4,2,t5_2qi0a

218785,0,t3_1wmd0p,My personal experience with people who dont program and dont do art but fancy themselves game designers has been pretty abysmal and I have a feeling Im not unique in that respect.That being said those designers also lacked heavily in math amp statistics which it sounds like you may have a good grasp on. Embrace those. They will be your friend as will physics  vocabulary.  As a designer working with programmers and artists you cant really create fun.  You can design fun and you can point out notfun and you can give suggestions on how to make it fun but youre largely at the mercy of your programmers and artists to implement those ideas.  That means you have to be an excellent communicator. You need to be able to find create and convey what you want.  To that end gamemaking programs are a boon not a hindrance.  They let you show what you want instead of just describe it. And when you do need to describe it thats where all that math statistics physics and vocabulary comes in.  The bottom line is you have to prove you can design and you have to prove you can convey your design to someone who may not speak your language.TLDR  as goodtimeshaxor said  make a successful game and youll get the benefit of the doubt on everything else.Edit  Just my  cents worth.,gamedev,cf3d5i4,23,t5_2qi0a
223084,0,t1_cf3lr45,gt I know how valuable it is to work in a team where everyone brings their best skill. But for SOME reason I am determined to have something out there that is completely of my own creation.My wife and I are both professional web developers and as such were both programmers both artists.  Ive got one game in development where shes doing the art and Im doing the code.  Its a load off!  She produces great art and I dont have to think much about it.  But Ive got another game all my own.  I wanted one title with complete creative control.One reason I went into web dev over taking a regular CC programming job was because web designdevelopment allowed more creative involvement  as the titles suggest both design and development.  The creative freedom there was far more interesting to me.  Its the same with game dev  my wifes a great artist but sometimes I just want to make exactly what I have in mind.  Art is work but its also fun why let someone else have all the fun all the time?  The idea that you have to be one or the other is questionable.  Theres certainly reasons to specialize but theres a lot of benefit to at least having some knowledge of the whole process.  Exploring the other side lets you round out your skillset  if you only know and understand your part in the process you may find it hard to relate to the needs of the team when working together.,gamedev,cf3ursk,1,t5_2qi0a

Thanks for sharing!But the writing is problematic . I found it extremely hard to readunderstand even though Ive done similar stuff myself. It seemed like too many words and ideas were crammed into individual sentences. It would be great if you doubled the number of sentences and took more time to explain what you mean.For instance even rereading this bit several times I couldnt understand what you were sayinggt In that game the backgrounds were all vertex shaded using actual geometry which gave the backgrounds a very smooth almost painted look. This got me thinking could I sum up the number of particles within a certain distance of each vertex on a bounding sphere and use this as the input to the pixel shader? The net result of doing this should be that any discontinuities in density should be averaged out and then smoothly interpolated between vertices for a smoothly continuous cloud. Curious to see if this was the solution I threw together the following vertex shaderI suspect a diagram would make that paragraph obvious. Unfortunately the link is broken too youve got trailing characters in it which makes it doubly hard to understand ,gamedev,cf53abn,3,t5_2qi0a

242201,0,t1_cf44hnl,Thank you for this feedback.What you experienced was probably a misconception because we dont convey it enough about how attacks work.Attacks have three modes Attack the row you are on Attack a random row Attack a selected rowSo depending on that mode the possible targets change because only cards with hitpoints themselves can block an attack.The other thing is the resistances which players in general seem to know nothing about. Each card can have  resistance points for digital and physical damage and each point reduces the damage taken by . The resistance is displayed in form of small bars beside the card power.Regarding the loading times. In general the game only loads during a load screen. But the queue management was a bit slow until today. We changed that up with our latest build.Thank you for trying it out.,gamedev,cf5uu22,1,t5_2qi0a

You create a skeleton and reuse that skeleton for each mesh part gloves pants head etc and skinweight that mesh to the skeleton.Then you can attach multiple meshes that use that same skeleton and by extension the same animations for that skeleton.

These what engine should I start my massive game on posts are like if an artist was asking what paint and paintbrushes to start painting a masterpiece on... its backwards.

354348,0,t1_cfhf4p0,Hey I checked your kickstarter out. Heres what I think The first line is slightly awkward I think its missing a that M.A.V. is like playing with legos only that you are building a giant mech of destruction. The opening paragraph needs some finetuning. First thing I spotted was a grammatical error the first your should be a youre. That aside I think that you need to describe the combat part a bit more. The way I see it the selling points of your game are two combat and customization. At the moment it focuses more on the latter. What I would add is a line from the combat section and I think this one works nicely What M.A.V. is about is making smart choices working with your team and adapting to situations. If youre wondering why Im being picky its because these opening parts are really important I think the biggest problem with your Kickstarter is that you started off with a long story description. A big wall of text like that will turn off most people including me. To be honest I didnt read it. While showing off the story for your game is fine I think you should do two things first make the whole thing shorter and then move it more to the bottom. You should start off with something easier to digest hopefully with screenshots. Why not the combat section? Screenshots look awesome content is short and interesting. The last comment I have is about the cosmetic changes pictures in the customization section. Theres waaay too much white space inbetween them it looks bad. It might work better to have all the guns squeezed together in one picture.,gamedev,cfhhtz2,2,t5_2qi0a
359011,0,t1_cfhp8jv,I agree with some of the comments....this part is really awesome impactful. The rest has a cool tone to it but feels a bit lacking in its overall depth.

467908,0,t3_1zgjxz,I think its great to see a kid trying to get into the game industry like this especially at such a young age. Sadly though youre going to have to change your mind set if you really want to stay in an industry like this. First off the chance of your game becoming a crazy wild thrilling success are slim to none. Games like Minecraft and Flappy Bird and Candy Crush arent one in a million games but their reach and following are one in a billion.There have been tons of small developers and huge teams coming through here with games trying to sell them and get them out there and theyre lucky if they break even on the amount of money they spend making them. The worst thing to tell a new developer but the one they need to hear the most is that youre not going to make a break out game the first time. Or the second time. Or the third time. Especially in an oversaturated market like mobile apps The fact that youre finishing games and releasing them though is a big step forward. Just start looking at the idea of making games you enjoy making and bringing them to the people.Edit What youve done so far is actually pretty good for a  year old! Keep at it seriously and keep making games you like and bringing your ideas to life. You can only get better from here.,gamedev,cftgb4k,3,t5_2qi0a
470221,0,t1_cftpe2z,No thats cool My main concern though is do these towers need to be totally different or can you save money by taking the towers from the first levels just given a lick of blue winter camo paint and maybe throw some snow models or decals onto the surfaces facing up and they look different enough that most players wouldnt know or care. Even the enemies you can have a human then have a green blue and red version and players will know theyre tougher depending on colour for example. Also you want  levels of tower defense? what happens if  of players never plays past level  cause theyre bored youve now got  levels that you crafted with love that most people wont see. I mean Ive played quite a lot of tower defense games.. and usually I dont finish them before Im bored with it. So  even with story and characters is hell of a lot. You could maybe break the game down into multiple releases and therefore you only then need the assets for the first stage and you can then cover those costs easier and use profits to develop the rest of the game or sell them as expansions etc. Just an Idea If you want to keep the budget low.,gamedev,cftps0t,1,t5_2qi0a
475518,0,t3_1zjny9,In my dealing with Isometric although Im not going tile based I havent really found that there is any best way to draw your tiles when going D. My game isnt using an isometric engine at all  its all flat images.Where the diamond shaped squares come in is in simulating what a square would look like if it were in  point perspective.D isometric however is just a normal camera that only uses  point perspective.

486031,0,t1_cfvhnep,A demo definitely does NOT address the issue. A demo does not suit every style of game and can do it harm instead if the player does not get the full picture or experience. Many well made games can communicate a wrong or skewed message by taking a small portion without context.And a star rating does not fix everything eitheras shown in the App Store context. Many apps can be rated  stars and never see the light of day due to an infinite number of factors.I dont doubt that Valve have a solution to all of this and really look forward to it and dearly hope whatever they come up it doesnt end up a quagmire of shite like every other easy to access distribution platform.,gamedev,cfvik7k,-2,t5_2qi0a
486290,0,t3_1zooeq,I think if youre making a game like Tetris or Bejeweled theyre good starting games so I would recommend something like Javascript for embedding games into a website. Javascript is a great way to start out and the HTML aspects of it allow mobile phones to be able to play the game as well. Phaser is a pretty good one not too sure about alternatives really Crafty is one Ive seen talked about a lot. Java is another good choice as well but is a lot less crossplatform. PCs can run it fine but phones wouldnt be as capable depending on the platform you use. Unity is also good because you can share it on all systems either through the web player or a dedicated app but a lot of features are stuck behind a paywall. Its really all about what you want to use as your primary platform but a good start is Javascript P.S. dont worry about your game getting hacked anyone who actually would want to would find a way no matter what platformlanguage you use,gamedev,cfvjmfx,2,t5_2qi0a

524703,0,t1_cfzwowk,In a nutshell its enterprise software design. Its vastly overengineered  much more so than any AAA game engine. And because its designed entirely around theoretical design patterns rather than the requirements of actually supporting a real game most of its design decisions are arbitrary and many of them just dumb and because its so limited in scope it somehow manages to be over complicated and yet lacking the critical features that in any real game engine would be tightly integrated into the entity management system  in particular replication including prediction and interpolation replays and scripting.Theres a really good reason every major commercial game engine is produced by a company that also makes games.

551863,0,t3_20gca9,THE BRAVEST FOURTBF is a turnbased modern day RPG for PC. You play as four college students helping their professor open a door which could lead to the worlds greatest secret...however some secrets are meant to stay secret.Battles are on the map and have a seamless transition and meant to be challenging without requiring a need to grind. There are items called Tools that function on the field similar to Zeldas items and can solve puzzles and stun enemies for an extra advantage in battle. Exploration is a huge element within the game with lots of puzzle solving openended areas secrets and easter eggs. If it absolutely had to be compared to something itd be Chrono Trigger  EarthBound  Zelda  Ratchet amp Clank  This Game Redesigned menu thats a bit simpler.  Old menu Natashas middle character flat. She doesnt have too much money and only buys the bare necessities on the cheap...and then some.  ...and this is her bathroom. Dont go inside though shes gets pretty ticked when people do that. A convenience store by the Alexandria Apartments for all your drunken late night needs. Obviously this employee is the epitome of good customer service.And the rest of the screens was stuff posted last week. Its being reposted since I posted late on Saturday and not too many people saw it. Got all of Gavins weapons finished. Hopefully I can spice up the menu a bit. Also finished all healing items. New Alexandria City Shopping District. Still gotta add more NPCs and liveliness to the area. Boss battle test.

574756,0,t3_20puey,Well its true that with ECS you will have lots of files. For each action you have a system and its component which may be a bit verbose.But the point is with OOP you can reuse objects ie. the player the enemy... but with ECS you can actually reuse game mechanics alone. It means a whole other world for gameplay iteration.As you said you end up with lots of componentssystems for simple action jumps attacks... which is a bit boring to writeuse but it also means that all those actions can be reused alone without any problem entirely separated from their initial implementation.When iterating you will be able to quickly mix game pieces between each others and alter the way the game play create new exciting things by using properly what you created before. This is actually way harder to do with standard OOP game programming.Ive been experimenting on ECS for a few months prototyped an engine in HTML and started using it and I really see a difference on what things I can do.For the part about mixing a bit of OOP in your components Id say be careful. I do that only to define low level types. For examples I have a Vector component which is actually to me something that should be a core data type ie. like an int so I put some methods in it just because it is so widely used and wouldnt have an impact on the ECS itself being just a low level data structure.So I placed myself this limit of using OOP methods only to define low level types that make the process easier. So far its going good this way.I have explained a bit more my view of the Entity System on the wiki page of my ECS html engine. Please note that this is a very early version not really usable I link this page only for what I expressed about my way of thinking ECS.,gamedev,cg5lrq1,9,t5_2qi0a

But thats assuming you own either of these games. If you just want to prototype ideas you can quickly get down to business by using such game editors and seeing how those are RTS engines it will save you a lot of trouble no need to figure out pathing unit selection etc. For demo purposes you could either play the game in front of the person if hes approachable physically send him the level if he owns either games or make a video.But note that the skills you pick up from using game editors are not necessarily transferable when developing an actual game in the future. If you are looking to be a developer in the long run perhaps you could pick up Unity and get a few ready made RTS modules from the Asset Store.Good luck!,gamedev,cg836r6,2,t5_2qi0a

601072,0,t1_cg84jns,Neat little game! Here are my thoughts I played on the phone Fun  yes its definitely fun already. I only played with AIs so I didnt get the full experience but the handling is pretty tight and the game is easy to understand once I got a hang of the controls. Instructions are fine but for mobile I would recommend making them more transparent and bigger. Half the time I was worried about placing my thumb at exactly the right spot on the screen especially when steering. Have you thought about using a virtual joystick for the steering? Maybe even for the accelerating and braking too leftright joystick only for steering on the left upright joystick only for acceleration on the right. Also I did not know how to exit the game to get back to the menu on the phone. I only saw one grassy level and was not sure how to change it. Personally I think its a little busy the grass could be less texturedgradiented. Otherwise I didnt think about it too much The AI cars were hilarious and posed a challenge only because they were blocking my way half the time. Have you considered giving all the cars health bars amp having parts fall off when they crash into one another? Might be a fun addition car slows down if your HP gets too low or something drop random HP items on the field to regain health etc... The team select screen was good overall. I can see it being fun when there are multiple players trying to get to their team and crashing into one another! There wasnt any obvious feedback however when I added AI to my team. Maybe some animations or a car driving into each team would be helpful there.  Capture the flag giving the cars HP would be more relevant here hide and seek tag provide small canopies where people can hide  of their car amp put in tire tracks demo derby  provide a base map with destroyable items and let people race from one side to the other either simultaneously or one at a time  high score determined by finishing time and amount of stuff destroyedLots of potential here good luck with it!,gamedev,cg8lfwc,1,t5_2qi0a

Sony is on its way to delivering VR and from a much more streamlined platform PS easier to market than PC.  Valve has much more resources and could surprise us at any moment with a product ready to launch.  If Oculus wants to stay competitive they have got to push harder to get this tech polished and to market.With the major caveat being the pricing.

Designwise though I would call myself unconventionally experienced especially with visual scripting.I started making games roughly  years ago in midde school using RPG Maker XP which has a fairly expansive visual eventing system. I became quite good at it and managed to work around its limitations to do some unheard of things in RMXP. My pride and joy was making the character into a series of masks so I could actually show the armor and weapons the party was wielding on them on the map. Mind you Im talking about the th Grade here! That was unprecedented in RMXP!Im preparing to go back to school for Computer Science and I feel like I grasp the programming logic fairly well but I havent spent enough time to really get good at it.The more I use it the more Im beginning to see Blueprints limitations but so far a few craft workarounds have helped.

Its a big library or a series of libraries all of which help you.  Maybe it will help with many aspects of your game or just one aspect.An engine is a huge deal.  If you decide to use some engine to make a game lots of the code you write and the content you create is probably affected by that choice.  Games made with a given engine often look somewhat similar to each other  most people could probably recognize a Source engine game by the graphics and even more likely recognize an id tech  game by its looks.  I could probably recognize any recent Unreal engine game because the mouse controls are always shit.

So if I only have  people in my team Its better to try and make a small sized game and leave more time for juicyness effects graphics etc. For small devs doing their first game I think its a good idea to start out with something fit for their studio size and more important their experience. The pitfall here is that sometimes they arent making a small game to leave time for polishing. Instead they just want to ship fast. The reason they also stay on top of the App Store is huge chunks of money thrown at advertising. They figure out how much they make per user. They already know how many organic downloads they get per day from being on top. Then they talk to various advertising companies that get them new users. If the CPI is smaller than what they make per user bingo. And bear in mind that the CPI is halved due to the organic downloads. I think instead of cloning mechanics devs should focus more on cloning the fun experience. It is hard and often not something tangible. What made it fun? What was it that I liked so much? Why? What made me stay in the game? What drove me to want to pay for that?,gamedev,cgi13lj,3,t5_2qi0a

Dont code yet....keep planning....Plan out how the game interacts with the different components. How do they keep synchronized with one another. How does it need to communicate information to updatetrigger events in your game. What is a player and what variable make them up.I think the following logical separations help Game Player Rendering AI. Pretty much every function in your game can fit into one of those categories. Does the function make something appear on the screen probably needs to be in Rendering. Does the function specifyrequire something about the players actions or configuration? Probably fits under player.Two additional categories Im using on a current project are Mapping and Physics as it deals with solar systems and related phenomena.TLDR  Planning  Coding,gamedev,cgs6odm,-2,t5_2qi0a

So even if you are going at the same pace it wont look impressive.  Think about it like blowing up a ballon.Secondly it is a lot more work to support a game at the same time as writing new features.  Its a fine line but no matter what after release you will have less time to work on it.Thirdly the nature of tasks changes later in a project.  Little polish items that might not make a huge difference in the game can take just as along as implementing core features.  The increased surface area also means implementing stuff is slower.So I dont think this is your imagination at all.,gamedev,cgug2wa,6,t5_2qi0a
794082,0,t1_cgtvocn,Perhaps use something like Disjoint Sets wikiBasically put each cell that could possibly be part of the corridor into their own sets i.e one set  one cell.. This does not have to be square or rectangular just as long as all cells are part of one mass. Also construct a list of walls between every cell. Now randomly go through the list of walls and check if the two cells on either side are part of the same set. If theyre not remove the wall and union the two sets. Keep doing this until the start cell and end cell where the doors are are in the same set. Now you have a path between the two and this final set contains ALL cells in the maze and ONLY cells in the maze. All other sets left over represent all cells that are not part of the maze.Some other things you could do to improve it Check the final set size. If it is above a certain threshold i.e. the maze is too big iterate through the maze removing cells with  or more walls that is dead ends remove cell from set add wall to the only adjoining cell. Continue until set size is at desired level. Alternatively if the set is too small you can continue unioning random sets although probably only want to union if one of the sets is the final set. Once the maze is finalised unmark every cell that is not part of the final set so that it can be used for other corridors. Youll also have to remove all walls that do not touch the final set. i.e both adjoining cells belong to sets that arent the final set. Or depending how your data is set up record which walls touch the final set then clear the original wall list.,gamedev,cgujh1m,1,t5_2qi0a

I searched and googled for a bit but found nothing relevant so please bear with me.gt So Ive had this idea running through my mind keeping me awake all night what if we organized a group to create a nonprofit opensource game as a virtual museum to preserve all past and future game franchises for posterity. Essentially this would entail a D game with basic functionality for navigation and movement set in a hub world that connects to hundreds or even thousands of different areas that each contain iconic or representative characters objects descriptions and scenes of notable games and franchises. I was thinking that the hub world could be a small model of the planet Earth to walk on with a universe of distant stars all around each representing and connceting to one of the areas. Of course fasttravel via a menu would be necessary with searching and filtering options by franchise publisher developer genre platform popularity et al. A visual guide for the history of video games would be a musthave as well.gt What I had in mind is that a small group could start out with  franchises and create a framework for this using custom models textures and music untilunless we get approval from copyright holders to use originals. From that point on a committee would slowly approve and implement additional franchises into the game with the community able to create mods and donate assets for their favorite games to be included in the official build. To this end itd also be necessary to write Quality and Submission Guidelines to retain a certain standard otherwise wed risk being flooded with stolen or subpar assets. Naturally the goal would be to obtain approval for as many original assets which we could display alongside the greatest the community has to offer.gt As for the title Id like to propose Retrospection A Universe of Gamesgt tldr There are already a lot of physical game museums but what could be better than a game to preserve all other games  the largest virtual museum ever. gt What do you guys think?,gamedev,ch3zmos,1,t5_2qi0a

I see you going down a similar path but as a one man band.I dont have any other advice other than execution of the story has to be your primary driving force not the shmup aspect. After play testing people generally told me they liked that the story existed or they hated it and treid to skip past it.  of the people however could actually tell me what happened in the levels despite fighting not occuring during key parts of it. We THOUGHT we were targeting a niche that would appreciate it but the truth of the matter is we were too amature to pull it off in a way that was consistent with our vision even if we were to target that niche. I find shmup people like to blow shit up and grow stronger not really read a bunch of dialogue. Im not teling you your idea will fail but if youre truly going for a story it needs to be the main selling point of the game not a second major feature or a third THE feature.

In this regard they are like snowballs you roll them down the development mountain and by the time they reach the bottom theyve grown and picked up things you didnt expect and the bit you had at the start is lost somewhere in the middle.You sound like the complete opposite of me. Im a designer whos great at creating overall visions for a games genre art style concept art narrative play style etc but i can sometimes get caught up when thinking about mechanics gameplay etc for that project..even more so if its something ive created entirely myself.I firmly believe in spending time on and thinking about an idea. Letting it grow and absorb information and details that are right for it rather than rushing and shoehorningcramming in as many mechanics and features as possible. At any given time I have like  different projects ticking over in my mind and I find leaving and coming back to a problem with fresh eyes really helps your ability to creatively solve things.

For example the lights and lack of external noise is good.Two at home i have just a  laptop but at work dual monitors.Theres no one there about  min after quitting time no one to disturb you.And last when you do go back home most of the commuters are gone.

951419,0,t3_24xo9r,Hello! Looking for a little push in the right direction. Using Unity to try and make my own basic match game and Im trying to wrap my brain around how I should be structuring the game pieces into the board formation. currently Im using a D int array and randomly assigning a number to each cell from  representing a block color but Im finding that this doesnt allow me to access the blocks. This is probably due to the fact that the first time through the board I instantiate blocks in the loop but I have no way of referencing back to them to manipulate them or delete them when Ive looped through again looking for matches as the D array is just integers.As I type this out I may be answering my own question but is it safe to assume that one way of doing this would be to create a  dimensional array of my gameobject type Block which should allow me to access the blocks directly? This is sounding good. Im going to try this.,gamedev,chcfnap,1,t5_2qi0a

961780,0,t1_chdkyqh,My first thoughts too. There are other issues too. A good study of pw in hearthstone would require large number of participants to even out statistical anomalies double blinding where both the person recording the participants stats and the participant dont know if theyre playing with a paid or free deck. This could be hard but is vital for removing prejudices. randomisation where people are randomly assigned to either the paid or free deck pools. again vital to avoid prejudices. proper statistical analysis of the datawithout those things this isnt just an indicator or rough answer. the data is useless. OP may think these things are overkill and that Im calling into question their integrity but studies have shown even when experimenters work with the best of intentions subconscious prejudices can affect the final results.only blizzard really have the data to answer this question and attempts like this that with best intentions lack rigour will only help to muddy the waters.,gamedev,chdm3cv,5,t5_2qi0a

How much of your work tends to involve PSXBoxspecific knowledge someone without a dev kit couldnt learn?almost all knowledge is something you cannot learn without a dev kit for the stuff i do. thats because for console titles you need to fulfill very rigid requirements and those are behind ndas. for instance there are lots of technical requirements that are checked on submission. this includes correct framebuffer sizes not stalling not showing a black image for too long etc. also a lot is knowing people you can ask because you cant google your problems.i think generally console development is vastly easier to ship stable because everybody has the same system but getting all the requirements implemented can be a nightmare.,gamedev,chfth5g,9,t5_2qi0a

Generally the more popular a game and the more iterations it has had the worse the code can get.This is largely a function of needing to make code do things it wasnt originally designed for and tight deadlines forcing ugly hacks. There is almost never time to go back and fix ugly hacks and in many cases you dont want to for fear of introducing new bugs or outright breaking a shipping product.

1102124,0,t1_chthgpf,Thats also an option. I believe RVO should always work in GCC but more importantly youll want to check if your default stack size on your platform is large enough or needs to be increased. But another option in case you want to use pass and return by value which will work in both the case of buggy RVO or when malloc must be used because stack size is tiny and cannot be increased is the following    typedef uintt rgba    typedef struct rgba  pixel buffer    typedef struct int kb time pixelmax input    typedef struct int abort w h output    output Handlerinput in buffer buf        const int w   h          ifin.pixelmax lt wh return output .abort          forint yylthy            forint xxltwx                buf.pixelyw  x  xffffffff                            return output .abort .ww .hh        int main         preallocate memory        input in  .pixelmax          buffer buf  .pixel  mallocsizeofrgbain.pixelmax         initialize SDL and OpenGL        for            in.time lt time            in.kb lt keyboard state            output out  Handlerin buf            ifout.abort break            ifout.wout.h gt                  upload new texture data if we buffered new pixels                 draw screen quad                 swap frame                             cleanup SDL and OpenGL        freebuf.pixel        return     So basically its always possible to model the main application handler using pass by value and return by value where the return value is a determinsitic result of the input value encapsulating a description of any modification to the buffers while preallocating all memory and preventing your application layer from being directly coupled to imperative side effects including memory allocation operations such as malloc or free.The engine can be increased in complexity by adding new maximum buffer sizes to input new buffer pointers to buffer and new reporting values to output describing the number of items or bytes which have been written. For example an audio buffer a network buffer and a loopback buffer for persistant object state.,gamedev,chtkfsw,2,t5_2qi0a

1140255,0,t3_275vla,I dont want to repeat others so here is my extras. Think ahead and make sure you know what you are doing. Even if your aim is to experiment and develop iteratively you need to know what you are experimenting and the goals of your current iteration. That way you wont be lost in the middle of your development and go Why am I doing this?. You should be able to answer I am testing if X mechanic is fun to play. This also helps you to determine your scope and time frame for the project. There are many ways something can be considered finished. A jam game is finished at the end of the time limit and that is that. A coding experiment is finished when you have done enough to write an interesting blog about it. A demo is finished when you have at least one playable level. May be you are approaching every game project with a goal to make a complete game to put on Kongregate or itch.io or with expectation to make money. Lots of devs ditch their prototypes they dont necessarily get bored of them. Its the nature of creative process. If something serves its goal its finished for you.

The only reason Id start from scratch and use only code is to learn whats going on behind a game engine. Its something I feel every game developer who has programming experience should do before jumping into an engine.If youre interested in D games and want to use Unity Id for sure start with Unitys Live Training tutorials on their website. To be more specific Id go in this order.Introduction to Unity in DD Character ControllersMaking An Infinite RunnerD Catch Game Part D Catch Game Part Top Down D Game BasicsThose tutorials give you the baseline for the thought process of creating a D game. This allows you to instead of copying a lot of code like I feel the tutorial you posted would do you can learn how to actually go about doing it yourself. Which is the best way to learn IMO. Mike is a great tutor and always answers questions.

Poser can export any D animation as a cartoonified SWF.  Carrara has a addon called VectorStyle  that will do the same.I did not see the perspective changes people mentioned but with tools like Anime Studio you dont have to do every frame.  You just set a keyframe out ahead and the software figures out what each frame needs to be between the current state and your new keyframe up ahead.   So it takes a TON of work out of this issue.Also software like Anime Studio I use it so I know it best can fake D by extending the Z of D vector art.  In addition you can also import rigged D models from Poser same company and they become vectorized models that are still poseable in a skeletal way and you can rotate around them in the D workspace to see they are true D objects.So I guess my answer is I dont know.

At that point youre basically playing a parking meter and it feels like it.On top of that when I the stingy player who only buys premium packs when Ive decided I want to support the studio which tends to correlate negatively with how abusive the game economy is have hit the point where Im waiting hours to take my next  second turn Im going to forget about your game in favor of whatever other freemium game dropped this week and will put me early enough on the curve to play through a coffee break. To be honest we dont know that users wouldnt like more traditional demos because its warped by the iOS App Stores lack of support for the model while the app economy was being established. Devs were prevented from using IAP to unlock functionality making demo mode on a single app impossible and users dont like downloading a paid app once theyve downloaded the free app especially after IIRC a few games burned people with loss progress transferring data between copies of the app.Im not sure whether that IAP rule is still in effect but freemium was always simply a hack to hide functionality behind inane time walls under the excuse that IAP was simply being used to remove an overcomeable barrier.Personally Ive found myself much more drawn to the expansion model where the industry has much more experience finding balance. Release a complete game for free then charge for new content that just so happens to also include new units that werent around in the free level. Ive found myself in board game adaptations a lot more lately because they fall into this model simply by taking the same expansion schedule the source material did.Apple seems like theyre about to make a lot of changes to the App Store experience and I hope a proper demo process is part of it.,gamedev,ci4g3xj,1,t5_2qi0a

Although if all games pay the curator the same amount why would a curator prefer one game over another? ... maybe the price of the games.A curator would prefer to push a  game over a . game since they get  of proceeds however that reduces numbers of sales as less people are able to buy  games vs . games. So it ends up becoming the curators problem to calculate which game he should start pushing and which games turn out more revenue.If were optimistic about it then we can hope that it would get so complicated and the Tubers get too lazy to calculate all that stuff and just recommend what they enjoy playing and that will be that. I guess well have to wait and see.I think PewDiePie will end up curating contents that he thinks his viewers will want and the he enjoys playing  provide entertainment value and thats good for the consumer.

It started out as a basic proofofconcept for a componententity system with code in components  la Unity. After about  months I had a good amount of source code for all kinds of stuff like tilemap rendering and entity management. I decided to make a full game with it because this was the first time that I used a framework XNA and felt completely fluent in it although I had no prior experience in it!. So I wrote a simple velocity verlet integrator and stole my collision resolving code from Reconstructing Cave Story P. I added a whole ton of stuff to it that you cant see in the pictures for example the tilemaps use protobuffers and are really customizable there is a special foliage system that supports burning down grass and plants there is no fire yet though! so thats really hard to show there is also infrastructure there to support per pixel destruction!

1354294,0,t1_cim1mpy,Starling in my opinion is not the fastest thing to be comparing against by any means but Starling would almost certainly be faster in many situations.  But staling is different starling only renders quads either solid or textured. This system renders fully scalable graphics more like the traditional flash renderer but on the gpu so no rendering to textures beforehand.  Starling can batch many quads into one draw call where this system can only do that for some meshes. But and this is the key difference Starling cannot scale assets and maintain that crisp look you get with vectors as it would have to strech its textures.  The library would allow you to zoom in and out of a scene with no loss of graphical fidelity which is what separates it from traditional approaches such as starlings.  Starling cannot render curves... with this you can. That is the key difference.  Edit  But to quickly add to that I have tested it on some android devices so far and it can render a test level with  or so animated character on it at  fps so I think it has plenty of potential. As for desktop the demo in the video above with  animated characters causes no problem for the GPU or CPU at all.,gamedev,cim1vhe,2,t5_2qi0a

1375293,0,t1_cio75p3, Its unclear that you need to click to start the game. I swear this was the first thing I tried but the game didnt start and I ended up waiting for quite a while as I thought it was loading. The movement is too slow and quite buggy. The camera can get caught in weird places inside the player in the worst instance when I had to restart the game to fix it and the camera angle is awkward ascending in the cage in the beginning. I liked the game over animation with the scissors. A clever nod to the mythology. Is the double jump ability intentional? It doesnt feel quite right. Hard to explain. Sometimes when executing a second roll midair the animation doesnt play. Seems like a bug. Increase the acceleration of gravity. I wanted to roll everywhere because ground movement was so slow but it ended up being just as slow because it takes about a full second to fall after the roll animation finishes executing. Same goes for jumping  the player should fall much faster. I like the use of giant candles for lights. Sound effects bug when the sorcerers spell hits an enemy Sounds like the effect is playing more than once at the same time or playing repetitively every frame. Combat isnt very fun mostly due to the issues above with the movement.I played as Theseus then the Sorcerer character. Didnt make it through more than  rooms either time.My Game,gamedev,cioohg3,1,t5_2qi0a

This is an ideal camera system for d modeling if youre doing something like modeling a character or modeling a car.in epics unreal editor the camera controls can be done with wasd. it feels more like your a ghost wandering around rather than someone holding the scene in their hands.

There was also an article around here a while ago which suggested to NEVER release your code solely under your name if youre eventually going to seek employment unless youre  sure it is optimized as possible and isnt messy at all.

Same guy who did a lot of  Example Extra. After tilesets were integrated I had a minimap that needed icons. I had to ask someone else to develop some miniature versions of the minimap in the same style. I put the icon on a backing I developed in  based on a screenshot from the LOTR RTS This is one of the samples modified with a base that I received that won an artist a contract worth k who has produces a large number of assets for me. Some elements of UI  extras from a sprite sheet. Buttons include their pressed state I have Gigs of UI psds. Theres also some extra in the form of what looks like perlin noise. Its actually from an image of tv static that I cut shapes from. I randomly shift a specific shapes between  samples taken from the same image and it simulates the tv static perfectly.

Good art can make or break a Kickstarter  when we launched Blood Alloys Kickstarter in October  the biggest and most common complaint we had was that art style seems.. inconsistent.   When you get a playable prototype start refining how it works and then use that to start building your art team.

What would be the legality if for example I finish the game and present it to them and they decide not to license the ip or whatever happens. Am I still allowed to change characters make the storyline different enough from theirs and then release it myself? Or would the fact that Ive already presented it to then nullify that on anyway?

1648480,0,t1_cjmyad4,gtI appreciate you want to be trusted as an artist but the visual artists working on the game wont usually have the sort of free reign youre asking for. Typically their department will produce some mood boards based on other peoples work so that they can get some feedback Key here is that the artists are coming to you with mood boards. The artist has been trusted to be in charge of not just creating the visual assets but actually designing the visual language of the game. This is quite different from the game designer choosing to create a mood board because in this case the game designer is designing the visual language of the game though anecdotally it seems that game designers usually have very high visual accuity so this wouldnt be as much of a problem. I can see where a composer would find it useful to give the designer references. Personally I prefer to make mockups and spec pieces as it seems to me part of the point of hiring me as a composer is that the music which your game needs doesnt exist strictly speaking. Otherwise youd simply use it. ,gamedev,cjmyd4g,1,t5_2qi0a

Most of them werent activated long enough to really get a feel for what they did or where you could use them.  The wrecking ball was awesome though.

I see other people have brought up the enemy damage I agree this should be represented with some kind of numerical value. Your game is basically a math game where youre finding the cheapest route I think adding numbers would just help reinforce the mechanic. You could still have players have to attack monsters to see the damage but they would get more clear feedback to act on. You also mention that youre not going to add missions but I think some kind of quests like Kill X bears or Kill  types of monsters could really add a lot of replay value.,gamedev,cjrb3ua,2,t5_2qi0a

1764638,0,t3_2eme5e,Start with pencil  paper. Dont need fancy paper or fancy pencils just something you can practise with. Then start drawing squares circles and straight lines. Try to make the lines as straight as possible. Then try crosshatching them again as machinelike as possible. This trains your eyehand coordination and will likely be a good practise every now and then even when you get better at drawing.Draw with your elbow not your wrist. Check out videos in youtube for further training but this is essential unless you like bad linework and things not turning out how you want them to turn out. Painters wrist is nearly immobile and the movement comes from elbowshoulder.DRAW. Draw everything you see try to study the perspective try to lose the details to see the bigger picture. Practise getting the value right it is absolutely essential. Just draw every day and you will get better at it.Just dont give up. Your drawings are likely not to turn out great but in fact every time you draw its an improvement on the last time. Keep practising and embrace the bad drawings  study your drawings critically because it helps you to learn. It takes a lifetime for an artist to become really good so getting good enough is not quick and easy either.Check out youtube for Neil Fontaine Sycra Yasin Will Terrell Xia Taptara and whatever you might find whose teachings work for you. Buy a cheap course at udemy Neil has them up and I think Sycra does too. Getting an art course will help you immensely.And dont think all this isnt necessary because you cant skip the absolutely basic stuff and go straight to the fun part but also dont lose your focus. Sycra has a video up on this very matter he makes very good points on it. If you need to be able to draw concept art then draw concept art and learn the necessary stuff while youre at it. As a programmer you know that you will learn the tricks of the trade while debugging code that doesnt work not by reading books that discuss the mathematics of a compiler. The books help you to understand but only by actually coding programs you will ever need that information. And if youre writing say behaviour scripts why would you need to study graphics programming theory? The same logic applies for art practise by doing the kind of art you currently need to produce not what you think is probably kind of important at some point.Again dont give up search for youtube videos cause there are lots most importantly have fun and love the art because otherwise youre going to have a hard time. Good luck!,gamedev,ck1l7pv,4,t5_2qi0a

1842649,0,t3_2fomkw,Your best bet is to make the whole game or a really fun and solid prototype without using their IP. Almost no games studios look at outside design pitches.  They do however sometimes publish smaller studios games.  If you already have a game and are approaching them as a publisher  you are more likely to get your foot in the door.  From there you tell them how much you love their games and how you drew a lot of inspiration from their IP but let them come to their own conclusion that reworking your prototype with their IP is a great idea.   This kind of thing happens super rarely but it does sometimes happen.  Look up Ubisoft Capy and the story behind Might and Magic Clash of Heroes as reference. ,gamedev,ckb8hxz,1,t5_2qi0a
1843727,0,t3_2fp0xi,My vote is to not write anything down at all unless you are making a story driven game.If you are making a gameplay driven game then start programming gameplay and trying to make it fun asap.  This requires a lot of playtestingtuning and maybe prototyping.  If you cant make fun gameplay like this then Im not sure it matters how much you write things down.I have google docs where I write down ideas that might be fun to implement so I remember them later but they are like one sentence ideas and I generally do this during development.Imo it is important to understand how systems work in the games you play so you can understand how to make a fun game.  If you can do this you should be able to just freestyle program  design your way into a fun game without having an extensive design doc.  The way to get good at this is by playing lots of games and paying a lot of attention to how they work.  If you approach a game from the perspective of a minmaxing player it might help you see the game from a game design perspective.,gamedev,ckbd5u7,3,t5_2qi0a

1854293,0,t1_ckckf87,Yeah but since a dev cant have all the journalists contactinfo there is bound to be a big part of journalists that might be interested that doesnt get it. Then you got the bigger ones that get huge amounts of mail which makes it harder to stand out.  Point of the idea is as I said new connections. As in no prior connection or knowledge whatsoever about eachother. If you sent a mail to journalist A then a post made in the subreddit I propose isnt meant for journalist A. Its meant for journalist B or youtuber C or blogger D. People that might find it interesting but isnt on the devs contactlist.    Of course you could argue that it already exists as there is several subreddits already having many of those kind of posts. But most of the Check out our game we just released is badly put together as you half of the time dont even get told which platform its for.

1901094,0,t1_ckg4wce,Awesome job. Game is really well polished. A few suggestions  I would want the ability to chose which missile Id want to control. It seems like it just goes    or whichever is ready if i have missiles  and  available and there is a target on the left i dont want  to launch. Maybe could have  joysticks which would also make it a bit more obvious how to play. I initially tried without the tutorial and it wasnt obvious since there was only  handle i kept trying to click it.  The tutorial was good but keep in mind a lot of people may skip this and try to play the game right away. If the tutorial is skipped maybe just pop up some text like drag me or something. I think the score should stand out a bit more since its placed at the same place as the ads at first I thought it was just an ad space and didnt even look up there. Then i noticed it was the score but the red text on the black background doesnt really stand out. It does have a cool control room type feel though. When the game starts up there is a half second glitch in the animation which brings up the clipboard. I tested this on a Nexus .Hopefully you found the feedback helpful. Overall I thought it was a well done game and compliments on the polish. If you can spare a min Id love to get your thoughts on my game Ninja Gold Rush Thanks,gamedev,cki9r6t,2,t5_2qi0a

It was ruled that if you use someone elses music in your own you owe the creator of the origional content a portion of your proceeds. In this case however they arent even making their own product. They are simply taking my product exactly as is and reselling it at a higher price point.Additionally they are now taking NEW customers away from me meaning that Im not getting money from those new customers. Thats not getting my cut  thats losing my cut for that new customer. Youll argue that I already got the cut when they first purchased it but they were never a customer. They were a reseller. Meaning the value of the intangible customer is never collected. There is more to this than just some simple percentage of money.,gamedev,ckl9tif,-4,t5_2qi0a

1936236,0,t1_ckmhvau,Interesting concept. Here are my feedback The game is somewhat boring. Buy something gt travel to somewhere else gt sell it gt repeat. Could be great if it is less repetitave It takes too much work for player to buy pepper. It demotivates players. Would be better if the cost of unlocking it is lower. How about adding some music and sound effects? The buttons may look better if it have a border.Since this game is in alpha. I guess that many new feature will be added in the future. This would probably make the game much better. Good luck! Spoiler Easy to tell that you are using libgdx scened. I see that the UI skin is the default one. P,gamedev,ckmi8ci,4,t5_2qi0a

Not really acceptable in a precision game like this one. Very hard to time the jumps if the game can suddenly slow to a crawl and then speed up for no reason. I recommend getting Adobe Scout and figure out whats going on.Other than that I like the game astetetic a lot but something like this will be a tough sell in the app store.

Making a complex interaction is even more fun but can be very stressful until it does actually work.  And I say this as a senior nongame programmer with plenty of years of making things work already.  It hasnt gotten less fun.The contrast that the least fun?  User input.  That includes menus clicks and pretty much any other way to get input from the player.  The only one that doesnt really really suck is generic joystick axisbutton input.  And even that sucks because PC players expect to be able to use a keyboard and mouse instead and you have to plan for that.And finally what do I want to be fun?  Art.

1989154,0,t1_ckst896,Someone correct me if any of the following is incorrect. Im not an attorney so I can but speculate based on my limited knowledge.I believe that the rule of thumb difference between a harmless homage and infringement is whether you use their IP. If you want to toss in easter eggs that actually contain specific references or characters the best way is to just ask permission from the owner. This should be significantly easier for indie games than for AAA.The simple textual references such as the ones you listed are just fine. Super Meat Boys copyright doesnt encompass all strings containing the word super followed by meat nor does Polytron get free reign on all fezzes that grant special powers so youre likely in the clear.A common way to get around infringement concerns is to change the name and logo in such a way that it doesnt contain any infringing content but still might remind the audience. One potential yet prolific example of this is Guacamelee! although theyre definitely toeing the line with many of these especially by using definitive elements of character designs. Better to stick with more vague references like the ones you gave.,gamedev,cksw6hu,2,t5_2qi0a

2009391,0,t3_2hr0qz,I am not some kind of game jam God but after the last jam I attended I was told by several people that our game blew them away. So we must have done something right. Heres what I think it was.Show up ready to codeMake sure youre all using the same version of Unity and have any additional tools that you need loaded and ready to go. Have an SVN repo or whatever you use set up. Create your empty project and commit it. Have everybody check out the project to their machine. Do all this before you get to the jam as internet can be slow at these things when  people are trying to download all the tools they forgot. I also made a new project in Pivotal Tracker and used that for issue tracking. Its not a huge project but youd be surprised what you forget when youre working that quickly. If somebody finds a bug have them put it in there as well as telling you. Basically you want to spend none of your  hours on downloadinginstalling tools or doing housekeeping.Control scopeKeep it really simple. One mechanic one character one level. You dont necessarily need menus or instructions. If its a  player game dont bother with a tapin screen  just have it assume there are  controllers present. Get a playable game ASAPOur jam went from Friday at pm to Sunday at pm. On Friday night we had our mechanic working with two players. No damage or win condition yet. By noon Saturday we had a complete game. Multiple players with health damage and a win condition. We had done what wed set out to do. If we were happy with the rough play and cubesphere aesthetics we could have stopped at this point. Everything else was polish. We added characters a background some nice lighting and a splash screen. Our sound guy came up with some great effects and a three song soundtrack.Build and test often and leave time for your final buildWe almost blew this one. I thought we should stop addingpolishing with two hours or at least an hour and a half to go. We kept adding features and polish until we had  minutes left only to find out it wasnt running so smoothly on our artists machine and shadows werent working at all. This was a problem as he was the only one with a laptop suitable for running the demo. We didnt have time to fix the issues and ended up having to drag up a desktop for the public demo. If I recall correctly we also had only tested with three controllers  and not four until about  minutes before the end and I ended up having to fix this do a build and submit our final version with about  minutes to spare.,gamedev,ckvbuor,25,t5_2qi0a

2016820,0,t3_2hucbk,As someone who went from artist to programmer I wouldnt recommend it as a career unless you can afford to actually go back to school and get a computer science degree. Even with  years of professional freelancing experience building software of all different kinds its been almost impossible for me to even get an interview for a full time job. If employers dont see that degree on your resume they wont even look at portfolios or code examples the resume just goes right in the trash.If your goal is to build games by yourself then by all means give it a try. But dont get discouraged if you cant grasp the concepts. Programming entails a lot of complex analytical and abstract thought and not everybody can do it.Just dont think you have to learn it. You may realize its too hard to get your head around or that you just hate it in which case dont waste your time. Some things are worth paying other people to do.There was a study done to try and determine who is actually capable of programming you can read about it here  I cant find the actual research paper but it is explained well enough in this articleYeah so for the article Id say you are misrepresenting the challenges associated with taking on programming as a career without formal education certificates to back it up. You are very dismissive of the idea that it is difficult saying things like software engineering or programming may seem daunting.

Few examples Players loosing skills spells or other player related data. Special items or blocks stop working because the mod thinks the player is offline .....The best use for this in my opinion would have been the ability to swap modpacks without having to relaunch MC but that is impossible.

2075488,0,t1_cl3mf52,If you can avoid writing to database for a multiplayer game even if its slim. Ideally you want the server to be handling realtime data in memory and saving to database only the data that is used between games or periodically throughout the game. Ive been writing some stuff in nodejs with websocket connections over Elastic Beanstalk for some heavy traffic games  though for smaller games running one or a few servers should be fine. The games Im doing it for arent webbased  the websocket implementation is just a handy spec to write in.To get started a nodeWebsocket server can be set up easily and tested from home without too much difficulty.Nodes can be gotten from There are websocket implementations available for PHP as well  though I cant speak to their effectiveness as I havent used them.

What would make SFML easier?gt SFMLs built in utilities for graphics though are miles ahead of SDL.Ill have to take a look at it then.

2103468,0,t3_2iw7ga,Hey spent  years in QA here.  One of the most common shittests youll get for the job is a basic QA test  ours was How would you test the functionality of the sticky grenades in Halo?  People who responded Well I would just... TEST them. were given a Thanks well be in touch and shown the door.  My response when I got hired  Basic run through of whether the sticky grenade can stick to level geometry.  Basic run through whether it sticks to vehicles.  Basic run through whether it sticks to players.  Then bounce it off level geometry and see if it sticks to vehiclesplayers.  If I throw it up in the air and it lands on the ground and then I step on it does it stick to my foot?  If I throw it and it sticks to the tip of your rocket launcher and you drop the weapon does it stay stuck to you or does it stay stuck to the rocket launcher?  etc etc  Alternative test That I was also given.  Heres a stapler.  How would you test whether the stapler works?  My response  Load it to max capacity with staples.  Staple two sheets of paper together.  Repeat  times.  Refill staples try stapling  sheets of paper together repeat  times.  Keep increasing until you find the  of sheets of paper that the stapler can staple before it starts to fail puncturing all the way through  of the time.  Verify that this  of sheets falls within the appropriate scope of the stapler.  If its an office stapler and it only starts to fail at stapling  pages at once then its probably fine.  Try stapling two pieces of concrete together.Try stapling nothing verify that the stapler still works after stapling nothing  times.  etcHonestly if youre going for an entrylevel position I wouldnt worry too much about Test plans workflow and the like.  Those vary highly from office to office  the constants areAre you an intelligent person who can find bugs and find interesting ways to break things?  Can you communicate clearly precisely and concisely both in verbal and written form?  Are you mature and able to handle yourself professionally in an office setting despite the fact that you work in games?,gamedev,cl772yo,6,t5_2qi0a
2106130,0,t1_cl7imtf,As I understand modern graphics cards dont clip as you might expect. Theres a conceptual guard band around the screen coordinates and if a triangle includes part of the guard band but does not go outside it then clipping happens at rasterization time by simply starting rasterization within the actual rendering area. Its only if the triangle goes outside the guard band that it has to actually generate new geometry.This page has more details and Id really recommend the entire series its quite wellwritten.,gamedev,cl7j9mz,16,t5_2qi0a

2210617,0,t1_clks9c9,In my experience most game engines dont have a fine grained fluid simulator its usually something to fake a ocean or river not a real physical simulation like I think your looking for. In actuality most D modelling software will have a better fluid simulator than game engines. Take a look at Blender which has a fairly advance fluid simulator although I think its more tuned for smaller scale stuff than large floods.Blender has a game engine thats really more of a scripting interface for python. Youd be able to build a system where you can control all of your parameters.,gamedev,clktn5r,1,t5_2qi0a
2211056,0,t1_clktyaj,With D modelling packages like Blender your essentially drawing a scene in D space not unlike but more complicated than photoshop. The results are called Meshes and they are essentially connected xyz points. It does support importing this data but the general workflow is to create them in Blender itself. Like all art its not terribly hard to get started but to make something that actually looks nice takes talent.Once you have your meshes Blender has various simulation engines that can interact with them one of which is a fluid simulator. It takes some configuring but if your comfortable with photoshop its nothing too outworldly. EDIT This video is a good example. Anything thats not fluid is a mesh which are drawn in D space. The fluid is configured its VERY resource intensive to get high resolution fluid youll need a good computer and then the simulation is ran and rendered.,gamedev,clkvnbm,1,t5_2qi0a

Started on our schools TRSs. Ill never forget seeing my first computer game  a classmate was making an Artillery game with those big chunky TRS pixels. Got my own VIC and learned BASIC. Wrote a few games including one that got published in Computes Gazette in    Learned some PASCAL in highschool but never really pursued a career in coding. I was more interested in creating graphics and art.I did continue to write code when I had to. Websites PERL scripts PHP etc. Starting about  years ago I started to code more in Second Life using their wonky LSL scripting language. Got into Processing for a while to write video processing scripts. I still code like Im writing BASIC but I usually get the job done. A little over  years ago I discovered Unity and started coding more using Javacript or UnityScript   whatever ya wanna call it. Having so much fun and getting better all the time.

I really enjoyed the boss fight in the old video it was very clear that the boss was strong and challenging.New videoPros Talking Understanding more of the game Crafting systemCons Your voice was difficult to understand. It sounded like you were trying to change your voice to sound more exciting like an action movie trailer. I think you should just talk normally as it will be easier to understand and more to the point. The very end of the video you tell people to play the game after switching to your end screen. I think you should tell people to play your game while you are showing the game. Only switch to the end screen when you have finished communicating all information that you want people to hear. Because when the end screen comes up many people will click off to something else or close the tab. Old videoPros Boss fight was very fun to watch looked really coolCons No explanation of what is happening,gamedev,clrqkjy,1,t5_2qi0a

2280202,0,t3_2l93js,Discuss as in do not argue or fight but talk about the details of every question or point openly with the interviewers. If you dont know something say I dont really know but if I had to guess... and give your best guess on the matter. Even if you have no idea go through the process you would go to find out andor solve the issue. I would look at this thing or place a trace... Be confident in your answers they will ask you if you are sure be sure. Better to be wrong and relaxed than doubtful and nervous. When they point out you are wrong just ask why calmly and try to understand why. Discuss it with them. Oh so this makes the conversion to uint so then the for loop compares to a less than the size... of course! makes sense! . Also make sure you have at least  questions to ask them at the end.And at the end of the day the main difference between C and C interviewers want to see is that you know how to handle your memory. That is the most important step when changing between the two languages. So make sure you know the differences and be ready to answer questions on memory allocationsdeallocations and when to do them. Also check on pointers.Good luck! ,gamedev,cltju93,2,t5_2qi0a
2281221,0,t1_cltnyzx,I fully agree.  Marketing starts at the very beginning and leads to everything else.  It should make up the very fabric of what youre doing.  But most devs I think have a project centric approach and a lot of them then drop the ball on communicating as well which at that point is most of the effective marketing available to them.I think you could write an entire topic post about the missteps in marketing that game devs make but as a layman the communication aspect is the one that grates on me the most.

Me and my friends roughly eight of us played through Minecraft to beat the final boss. Once we did so we stopped playing. There was a clear prescribed goal in Minecraft which we beat.

2345018,0,t3_2m72y2,If you are making games for you portfolio I assume you are trying to become a game programmer. You are going to be expected to develop code.  You wont be hired for your game ideas.  So your portfolio doesnt need to be full of interesting new concepts.  It just needs to show off demonstrable skills.Those games work great because they are relatable and you can cut down your description to just the title of the game.  So instead of having to say that you made this game where blocks of various shapes fall down and players have to line them up to make complete rows and the goal is clear as many rows as you can before the pieces stack all the way to top...  You can just say that you made Tetris.The other thing you want to do is to make sure that they show off the particular skills that you want to demonstrate.  If you want to focus on graphics make sure that you put in a lot of flashy but still tasteful shader effects.  If you want to be an AI dev make sure that your variant of a game includes enemies that think.  ,gamedev,cm1k0p9,15,t5_2qi0a

2354396,0,t3_2majdz,Id say that the structure of the game logic is highly dependent on the game and the gameplay. So the best way to approach it is to design. It is difficult to think with only a paper with some diagrams on it but it is better to think ahead of the work.At my current job we have a stupid architecture. Without going into specific language details therere some types of ingame objects. Theres a huge Game object which holds collections of those types. So everyone can ask Game to get something. And of course the Game has lots of signals and functions. While the map and visual representations are somewhat separated it all looks clumsy. It leads to lots of dependencies in the code architecture. Its bad not only because of the difficulty of modification and improvement but for C it affects the compilation time.I know a one general approach to the logic architecture. Maybe not the most easy and useful but anyway. Every game entity has different presentations view for rendering model for physics scripting etc. controller for user input etc. and the base presentation which holds basic properties of an object position velocity....There is a system for every presentation which is simply a container for the certain presentations of objects. Also every system is responsible for dealing with part of game  renderingphysicsinput. Every presentation of an object minds its own business. For example view presentations hold a sprite while they get position from the base presentation. Model one holds objects physical body.The hard part is to get it all connected. First the object should have a way to communicate between its presentations so incoming damage from the model gets a blood effect on the view. Directly calling each others methods is not a good way cause it would become a spaghetti soon. One way is to communicate through the base presentation.Then you want for objects to communicate with other objects. Heres where systems come into play. They should provide a convenient search methods by idnametype. So if object A wants to use object B it makes  steps checks for existing B in constructor and subscribes for an event of Bs creation. So the order in which objects are created is not important.Also mind that there shouldnt be circular dependencies so an event like onObjectDestroy is a musthave.,gamedev,cm2pq11,4,t5_2qi0a

I know that for CoD Im subpar at best.  So if youre not the absolute best should you be able to BEAT the absolute best just because you know some tricks about the code?

2585657,0,t1_cmw0q2r,Id like to simply link to the article where they individually responded to those accusations their site is a One Page site that doesnt generate a URL to link directly to the articleSo here it isgt Hello to all of you!gt gt Those were a long long few days since our trailer relase. We feel obligued to write down this post to report how things are going and to set some light on a few things. First of all we have to quote well that escalated quickly!. We knew that our reveal will cause some shitstorm but never expected it to be so huge. We wish to thank all of our haters and all upset press for a great marketing campaign theyve done for us. A week ago we were a little company from the middle of nowhere just some guys making some game. Today everyone heard about Hatred and us. All thanks goes to those who were trying to harm us with no desired effect what a pity. On the other hand  we didnt expect that much of support and we werent aware of how many people are out there who think like us and who will entitle themselves as our dedicated fans. We want all of them to know we wont stop we wont change what this game is going to be and well deliver the best game we can to all of you!gt gt Many can call us attention whores  well we try to get worlds attention to our product and as you can see  it worked perfectly. But there are some true attention whores out there who are trying to imply that we are neonazis and some other stupid stuff. Do not believe everything you read on the web especially written by noname pathetic bloggers or some unhappy guys commenting around the web. From all of the shitstorm upon us that was the only thing which really made us pissedoff because its simply too much. Ive been told that it would be best for each member from my team who were accused of such things to write down his statement and publish it. So here we gogt gt My grandgrand father was killed by Gestapo. Some members of my family were fighting against nazi occupation in the polish underground army called Armia Krajowa. My forefathers suffered greatly because of totallitarian regimes so who the fuck would I be if Id truly support any of nazi activists? People give likes on Facebook all the time even if they dont know what is exactly behind this or that fanpage. I did the same. Suddenly it makes me neonazi great have fun you stupid ass haters. Learn some history first because when I read about polish death camps it makes me disgusted. You dont know shit about our history and you fall easily to false propaganda. The hateful title Im working on where virtual character hates virtual characters doesnt have any connection to what I truly believe and think there is a reallife outside you know? Maybe you should try it? I will never ever again respond to any of those accusations this is my ultimate statement.J. Z.gt gt Nazi Germany is responsible for killing  milion people in Poland. Half of them were Jews half of them Polish. My family suffered many losses during the World War II. Anybody accusing me for being a follower of said ideology should really think twice before doing so and consider reading some books on the topic. This is basic history knowledge really and also happens to be a very personal matter for me. I am not a neoNazi nor a fascist and it is utterly disgusting to be called this way. And I have to say its really surprising for me how somebody from the United States especially can have troubles understanding such simple and universal values as patriotism honoring one own national symbols and caring for the future of his own country. Values like pluralism  democratic opposition and the right to manifest one own views shouldnt be called the lack of tolerance. Finally regarding my attitude towards gays let me just say that I have a few gay friends that I deeply respect as people and have no problem with their sexual orientation.gt M. K.gt gt In response to repeated allegations against me Id like to state that Im opposed to all totalitarian ideologies. The tshirt that Im wearing on our team picture refers to National Polish Army troops that in  refused to lay down arms and continue fighting against the new invader to regain independent Poland. They did so because theyve rightly anticipated Soviet security service repressions against Polish already demilitarized army. I would also like to emphasize that until the year  those troops were actively fighting against the Third Reich occupation. Those soldiers are Polish national heroes and as such deserve commemoration. Just as much as American troops that lose their lives fighting against terrorism. As to organizations that profiles I follow they refer to the patriotic and libertarian tradition and not to the totalitarian ideology.gt J. S.gt gt There is one more thing  accusing Hatred to be some kind of racist game. What the hell is wrong with you people? The Antagonist is killing everyone equally race doesnt matter its randomly generated for all NPCs sex doesnt matter its random too so you can call it the most tolerant game promoting equality.

The taking damage sound effect is much to quiet in relation to the others for how important it actually is. Another good idea in relation to this would be toying with some screenshake or a flash on the players sprite to give a better visual indication as to my knowledge there is not aside from the heart containers at the top.As for the rest the only gripes I had was not having enough uses for the money and enemies only showing up after you bump into them or get close enough. It may just be my lack of skill but I was much more often making the choice of buying a red heart than a heart container though that choice is an interesting one. As for the enemies only lighting up as youre really close maybe that was a deliberate decision but Im curious as to why it was made?Finally I have to say I really enjoyed changing classesweapons.

2641038,0,t1_cn36b2m,While it is easier that way you dont have to have all of your frames be the same size. You can make an atlas file usually just jsonxml that describes which frames are part of what animations what order and how long to play them and the rectangle on the sprite sheet that contains that frames image data. For example          frames          id  x  y  width  height           id  x  y  width  height              animations                   name idle          loop true          frames             id  duration               id  duration                               Thats just a rough approximation off the top of my head but something like that should work. Then you can load that information in along side the sprite and when you want to play an animation you just load the animations data and size your rectangle based on the animation frame data from the atlas.As for the character firing a projectile the way Ive always done it is to animate the character without the projectile then animate the projectile separately. When you use the ability play the animation for the character and at the appropriate time spawn a new projectile object and let it animate itself.,gamedev,cn3bdo6,1,t5_2qi0a

Its a great strategy used by many because it saves time and allows you to make highly detailed new models in very little time. Other than that there isnt much else you can do besides following good modeling practices keep good topology make clean UVs etc. Many artists recycle assets for years thanks to following good practices making new assets could be as simple as just making a new texture rather than having to start from scratch and many character artists recycle the same basemeshes for years.,gamedev,cn8mq6i,2,t5_2qi0a

As a beginner programmer Ive seen lots of tutorials that try to dissuade me from using programming techniques that are inefficient. Small things that can add up.

2768976,0,t3_2rru3b,Adam from Butterscotch ShenanigansMy advice Just start making games and playing a diversity of them with a critical eye. Game design is not an established field by which I mean there are no right ways to teach or do it and so far as I know there arent a lot of academic journals etc on the topic. So it would be hard to find a program that would be worth much even if you went all the way through a PhD.Its the same deal with something like writing a novel. Most of the novelists we think of are just people who read and write a lot and consequently learned by experience. If you get a degree in novelwriting but dont have a novel to show for it no one would call you a novelist. But once youve written a novel youre a novelist no matter what you studied before that.The most important thing that defines a game designer is having actually designed a game.,gamedev,cnitm16,6,t5_2qi0a

2840753,0,t1_cnqz1vf,Lets see if I can be a little bit more specific about the problem. You see the rigidbody method is something I cant do to prevent errors inside of another script.    This is my game.  Its a very simple puzzle game where you make squares out of circles. If it detects a square of the same color all the circles that form the square will get destroyed.    So heres the thing Keep in mind that I just started to learn how to program and this is one of my first exercises. So everything Ive done so far is very devious and stupid.    Okay so heres the thing.  The circles themself are children of an object called CircleParent this has a rigidbody attached to it and a script thats able to drag and drop the pieces into place.  The circles get randomly spawned inside of this parent so they have a random set of colours.    The dots where the pieces are placed have a BoxCollider between them that counts how many lets say black pieces are in the square.  Like this    When they detect  black pieces the children of the parent object get destroyed.  Why? Because there will be a null reference when it needs to Instantiate a new circle and the parent object gets destroyed as well.    So the parent object with a rigidbody stays in the scene but youre not able to see it. Therefore the if a rigidbody leaves method will not work.    Now the parent object is a non trigger circle collider. The BoxCollider squares will only react to trigger colliders.  Every piece inside the parent object is a trigger collider.    Now I need to figure out is  How the hell do I let my BoxCollider square know all of the children objects are removed? There arent any triggers touching it anymore so OnTriggerStay doesnt apply anymore. Also the OnTriggerExit doesnt work because all the children objects are being destroyed.    Anyway I hope this makes sense and someone can help me figure out how to do this. Because Im this close to finishing my first game and very proud of what Ive done so far.    Also every programmer is gonna look at this post and think This guy is an idiot.   edit  It needs to know that there arent any children objects anymore so it can reset the count to .  If I would say something like If all get destroyed counter goes to  it will still say the number of colours it had in the box next to it after the objects are destroyed.    Thats why Im looking for something like if the boxcollider doesnt touch anything reset the count to .,gamedev,cnqzo9z,1,t5_2qi0a

2869654,0,t3_2sykzx,I personally like it when credits are able to incorporate the games universetonefictionassetscharacter etc.  Think about ways you can easily repurpose your game assets in an entertaining way to either present the credits in a stylized format or provide some entertainment for those who choose to watch them ie  game character goofing around in the margins.the main thing is to not get carried away and do a huge production about them as very few people will likely finish your game andor opt to see the credits voluntarily from an options screen.

2869744,0,t1_cnu9ycr,Those are all perfectly valid arguments that point to potential problems. I would argue rather strongly that most of those also apply to engines you create yourself.Your software does not operate in a bubble and it already needs to interact with drivers operating systems possibly more direct hardware interfacing et cetera. Someone deals with those problems.Engines are not all closed source which relieves some of those problems  provided you or the members of your programming team are skilled enough even with the code which is not a guaranteed thing but it is available.Two main driving points It is almost always the wrong choice particularly given the level of game development indies and Redditors on rGameDev are at. Sprites colliding with other sprites is a solved set of problems. Severe underestimation of the effort required to build a stable if not flexible engine.Even if you have the chops to make such an engine did you make it flexible enough for your next game? If so how much time and effort did that take? If not was making a custom engine actually necessary?As an anecdotal observation this seems to stem from programmers preferring to write new code over reading and working with someone elses code. NIH syndrome is some really toxic in terms of productivity stuff.For some reason I never see game developers trying to write their own drivers. Shouldnt the idea of users running proprietary Nvidia display drivers terrify you in that case? Time to roll your own display drivers. Im being facetious of course the payoff isnt worth the effort.But you still constantly see devs rolling their own engines for D platformers.,gamedev,cnuah5v,1,t5_2qi0a

3014325,0,t1_co5l13y,So I just played your game with one other person with xbox  controllers on windows . While we both found it frustrating I at least had a good time while he was just frustrated throughout and wanted to stop.  The gravity was confusing for both of us but it wasnt until the third game that my friend started using only one button to change gravity. I had been using this strategy the whole time and found it easier to comprehend what was about to happen. Do you guys use both bumpers for gravity changes?  There needs to be a better way to tell which direction your gravity is. It seems to be wacky so maybe just put their color as the land in that direction or something and mix it when more than one are gravitying in the same direction.  The characters look the same upside down as they do right side up. The two blobs are kind of better at this though but I feel like they really arent there yet. This added to the confusion of which way is my characters gravity. Also the way they were facing was confusing.   So at the end of it I found this sort of gravity flyingswitching directions fast to get where I wanted to go pretty satisfying to learn and execute but my friend was frustrated and really wanted to stop playing. He doesnt really deal with controller confusion well though so its not really his kind of game. I had fun chasing him down through the level though.   So all in all I had some fun. I would throw in a bunch of wacky power ups and more funny voices and if no other game out there has done the gravity thing before Id say you might be on to something.  Feel free to ask any questions or ask for further explanation. If you are still making this in another Feedback Friday Id love to trade some more feedback with each other.

3063814,0,t3_2v7nlj,I dont have much experience with automated testing in games but I was on a test automation team for large scale cloud storage for about  years.   I guess that automated testing can encompass anything leveraging scripts to alleviate the burden of manual tests.  You can have tests that only  automated the setup for instance and then require manual steps after that or you can have tests which are completely automated and triggered via continuous integration which is the most pure form of automated testing.  Its important to understand the different between unit testing smoke testing and integration testing.  Also black box vs grey box vs white box etc. Automated testing is not always a long term win.  Automation of tests requires investment in creating a testing framework reporting integrating them into the build and ongoing maintenance of the tests as features are addedchangedremoved.  There are additional skills required to write effective test cases that can be automated and it adds some overhead to the development cycle.  Keep in mind that automated testing is software development and if you dont have good developers writing your automated tests and triaging the results it can lead to a lot of pain. I dont know exactly what the cutoff is for making the investment but it is worth thinking carefully about how much automated testing you really need and how much you can commit to maintaining. Probably the flashiest thing I have used personally is mobilebrowser automation via Selenium and Appium spinning up headless browsers in a vncserver or emulators in a vm on many servers even taking screenshots on failure.  Another of my favorite things was a graph based testing system that would randomly assemble test cases based on small units of work and combine them to create longer tests passing the input of one operation to the next and causing failures along the way. However the actual coolest thing to me is sitting around on a Sunday afternoon and realizing we have almost  clusters in the lab churning through tests right now on our different products then coming in on Monday and seeing a whole new wave of test results.  We have an entire queuing system to assign test suites to different clusters and we can prioritize different tests depending on recent feature development and it all collects metrics and results automatically. One big difference I can see for many games is the release lifecycle.  If you are building a game with a long lifecycle that will encompass multiple large updates and expansions then automated testing is probably crucial.  For instance an MMO or a MOBA or even many strategy games.  For other stuff such as single player console games you might only be pushing out a few bugfix patches after release and thats it.  In those cases it might not make sense to have a large investment in automated testing because automated testing is best at catching regressions and bad at keeping up with rapid product iterations. The biggest change for me after working for years in automated testing was to resist the urge to automate everything.  You need to pick your battles and come to grips with the large investment that automated testing really is.  Think about where your tests will be in  years.  If you have broken tests that nobody canwill maintain its just adding noise.  I would much rather have  tests for crucial functionality that reliably pass and only fail when the product has changed or broken than to have  tests of which  fail intermittently for random reasons or that are built on a poorly designed framework with insufficient logging or are too closely tied to product implementation etc.  By the time I left test automation I considered my primary goal to be relieving burden from manual testers.  Not writing flashy or fancy code.  Not  test coverage.  Relieving burden from manual testers by taking boring regression tests and automating them.  Why?  Because most of the real interesting bugs are best found by experienced manual testers doing adhoc testing.  Good manual testers are good at pushing boundaries poking at systems until they break finding flaws and doing things in an unusual way.  One of the best things automated testing can do is to free them up from running the same dumb tests they have already run on the last  builds and give them the time and space to do what they are best at. Write lots of logging and capture everything possible on failure.  If you can afford the time to build a postmortem collection framework it is often worth it.  Once you have a significant amount of automated tests triage and maintenance becomes a huge timesink. For larger companies an automated testing team can be a great place for younger hires out of college that might not be ready for a fulltime development role.  They learn the product they learn the process they learn software development best practices and they can much more easily transition to the development team when the time is right.,gamedev,cofk80q,7,t5_2qi0a

3067894,0,t3_2va2qi,I faceplanted quite hard today right after I had a small victory. Ive been learning pixel art and sprite animation and I finally got a preliminary knight done with walking and sword swing animations. I managed to get him into the game and after a lot of coffee and cursing I got the animations to work as intended.So I tried to put the sword there as well. I had the behind the scenes code up and running and was able to kill enemies with an invisible sword. Now it turned out I had overlooked a major thing here It takes a ton of effort to make the sword work correctly. Sigh.You see I have the sword swing hitbox entity which has the sword swing sprite attached to it. This works nicely but then theres also the walking animation where the sword should be wobbling left and right as the character walks. This needs yet another entity and yet another sprite component. Then theres the icon thats used when the sword is dropped on the ground. Ugh.Its probably just a small refactor to overcome all this but at the moment I feel physically sick. I just want to quit.,gamedev,cofzf3d,5,t5_2qi0a

Trademarks only protect you in the class of goods that you sell in so Apple computers is protected but not Apple apples. Smoothies are different than games in your example certainly.

If not you are A COMPLETE IDIOT because you somehow managed to find the few incompetent companies out there. You looked at their website full of spelling errors in a country where the FIRST language is English and yet you were stupid enough to go ahead. etc.Alteratively you know NOTHING about app development or design.

Just the framework for the grabbing feature has been in development for the past couple months.So Ive identified a problem. Now what? Well I need to figure out how Im going to solve it. I believe one of the major issues is the way the code is designed at the moment. Its desperately needing some large overhauls.With that in mind Im going to try and spend extra time refactoring and redesigning. This will be in addition to the work I normally do on the livestream and Im not planning on livestreaming it.One problem with deciding that a code base needs to be reworked is that you can easily get stuck only reworking it. This means you dont make any forwards progress on new features. Doing the redesign as extra work rather than replacing existing work time should help prevent this from happening.  Hand Holding Turns ViolentWhile on the livestream today some players decided to form a circle and  hold hands using the grabbing feature. This was all well and good but then the circle was abruptly disrupted and the whole thing turned into a melee! Fists were swinging characters were running all over the map... It was chaos!

Overall the great sound effects and music fit really well with the artistic style and gameplay. At first I was confused by the control setup and couldnt make sense of the how to play though that very well could be a result of my current state of sleep deprivation. After spending a bit of time with the game however the controls became more apparent and by the time I died to the first boss I think I learned how to use all of my abilities. The difficulty seems good tough but not overly punishing it made me want to come back later and do better when I died. One nitpicky suggestion I have is to add a bit of a timer to chest drops so that you can see them before you grab them. Ill come back later to give more coherent feedback once Ive gotten some sleep.

3180032,0,t1_cordqm7,After reading the post I had pretty much the same reaction. Use an authorization token in your software hit a secure restful service and let your server code interact with the database. Its a lot easier to safeguard a rest implementation than a raw database connection and it keeps you from having to put your database password in your code. It also keeps your code much cleaner since you can just hit the SubmitScore or whatever you want to call it service method send it your token a username and a score and you dont have to deal with databaseimplementationspecific code in your game client. If you ever want to update your database you just tweak the code in the rest service on the server and the client doesnt have to know or care that it happened. Heres a good starting point for information on securing a rest service,gamedev,corlxw8,3,t5_2qi0a

I encountered this bug when I was clicking commission a fleet but every button does that. I even clicked off on another planet and then selected mine and it would still glitch. I restarted the tutorial it still creates that problem. I ignored the tutorial and it still wont let me click on the menu I am using Windows  Chrome Browser. Okay I switched browsers to Internet Explorer and now the menus work well. The part where you fly the small ship around and collect asteroids. I didnt realize it was based on where you click. I tried to use keyboard movement. Maybe put a littler popup that fades saying click continuously to move? I encountered a typo  In the top left it says well qsend I tried shift clicking on the my system and it highlight all of the starts in the map  I got into combat and lost. I didnt know how to fight the enemy. I selected all of the icons on the enemy ship but I didnt know what they did. Maybe add a tooltip with a small description? I clicked the skip battle delay and my ships lost all of their battles. I even had one fleet that had  or  battle ships.  I think overall I am confused. I think that it would be super helpful to have tooltip popups everywhere. That way if you miss it in the tutorial or forget about it later.

Publishing wants to present the new version to the public at E which gives us exactly  months to refactor this code. Now we have some middleware to implement and a code base from our sister studio that we can use but a lot of that was written in French since theyre in Montreal. Publishing is lending us some engineering support but theyve never worked in Unreal before so there might be a learning curve there.

3290325,0,t1_cp3bbbv,Depending on the type I agree.  But many games havent been developed in a purely CC environment for a long time.  Many games may use CC for the backend like Unity does but then scripting in the front from Javascript to C to Python even.  Most logic and such doesnt need to be C and in fact there are many advantages for it to not be  including but not limited to not having to recompile for small changes to logic code and making live changes to game data and logic without having to code that into the game itself.,gamedev,cp3bnku,1,t5_2qi0a

3296634,0,t3_2xw9hy,Check the FAQ section as well. Its telling some great things thereNotablyQ I play a game built with Unity software what should I know?Unity has probably collected some or all of the following information about your device Unique device identifier generated from the device MACIMEIMEID which we immediately convert into a different number using a one way hash IP address Device manufacturer and model the operating system and version running on your system or device browser type language the make of the CPU and number of CPUs present the graphics card type and vendor name graphics card driver name and version example nvdisp.dll ... which graphics API is in use example OpenGL . or DirectD .c amount of system and video RAM present current screen resolution version of the Unity Player version of the Unity Editor used to create the content a number describing whether the player is running on Mac Windows or other platforms and a checksum of all the data that gets sent to verify that it did transmit correctly application or bundle identification app id of the game installed. Some Unity developers use Unitys analytics and ad services which collect additional information. See FAQs on Unity Analytics and Unity Ads below.Q That seems like a lot of data why so much?We try to limit the collection of this information from any one player or device however certain operating systems do not permit us to note that the info has already been collected. This means that the data may be sent to Unity each time you start the game. We use the information to make decisions about which platforms operating systems and versions of them should be supported by our game development software. We aggregate this data and make it available to developers at stats.unityd.com. This data helps us improve our Services and helps developers improve their apps.Link is not up yet as of now. Maybe later? Edit Its up!The one Im particular not sure is whether Unity Analytics and Unity Ads are optional the wording from the rest of the faq seems like it is. If they are optional then Im fine with the collection since those latter two Unity Ads and Unity Analytics seems the most intrusive which I think is the actual source of the backlash in this thread. ,gamedev,cp41jqk,114,t5_2qi0a
3297232,0,t1_cp436rx,Hence why I referred the backlash is a bit misplaced since it much more warranted for the data collected by Unity Analytics and Unity Ads instead. If those are optional plugins then its good and I honestly never use them and not going to.Now after reading most of the page all these clauses wording is simply Unitys way of acting like the frontfacing company ala Apple instead of Google all you do are your own doing for the developers. It kinda makes sense since indies dont usually form companies unless they raking it big and they dont have the legal manpower to draft stuffs like this.Especially since theres a lot of may and when particularly specified it goes back to Unity Replay Unity Ads or Analytics. Feel free to correct me if you find the outliers cause I cant find one so far. Many of it covers lots of stuff in case Unity developers choose to do so. Hell just look at the titlegt INFORMATION WE MAY COLLECT OR RECEIVE DEPENDING ON WHICH PRODUCT OR SERVICE IS USEDSo chill out people. Hold down your pitchfork until they clarify more on this. Also from the way it is worded and structured if you use Unity and indie instead of making your own Privacy Policy from scratch or hiring legals to do so using or linking to Unitys own Privacy Policy are simply enough for your game since it provide an extremely large enough coverage for lots of use case and quite userfriendly. ,gamedev,cp44074,4,t5_2qi0a

I tend to create a quick grey scale highmap over the top of my texture to plan out the relief then just push that image through nDo with a few styles and composite the results together. As with all game art though it depends on the game your working on and what assets your creating. You tend to get better results from high poly sculpts but it takes a lot more time to create the high poly assets. If your making a racing game for example you wizz past this stuff so fast that using tools like crazybump nDo or substance will get you where you need to be. ,gamedev,cpa5bgj,1,t5_2qi0a

Instead of staying near asteroids have the ship play the mining laser animation on nearby asteroids. Instead of warping out call it warping to the mining facility. This way the player sees his objective is to gather as much ore as possible and deliver it safely to the base. Itd be more meaningful than just gaining points.

But I dont know what format your assets that have blendshapes are in because it depends whether or not the import plugin required for that file format supports blendshapes.  Blender does do a million things but then I dont know of any other package that only edits blendshapes nor why anybody would create a package that only does blendshapes.  But editingcreating blendshapes with Blender should be quite straightforward once you familiarize yourself with the basic interface. The blendshapes are stored in the same logical way and interface as UVs and other object data.  EDIT  Heres a wiki page describing all the operations you can do on blendshapes for your purposes you can skip all the animation stuff,gamedev,cpsgodo,1,t5_2qi0a
3514235,0,t3_30itty,As someone who is a programmer by trade and  art skills. This is most definitely not the case. All those objects you see on screen are Mono Behavior class objects You build classes which extend the functionality of mono behavior objects to create whatever you want.. For reference i probably spend  percent of the time in unity placing objects tweaking things and testing and  percent of my time in visual studioSure there are some drag and drop things going on. But these are things that you dont really want to have to build from scratch everytime you try to develop a game. Dont feel like rolling your own navigation system? implement unitys nav mesh. Dont feel like coding a FPS camera controller? Use unitys standard FPS controller...For me as a programmer it lets me focus on coding the things that make my game unique the mechanics and things ive come up with to put in my game. And less on dealing with all of the uninteresting problems that everyone has already solved thousands of times. Youll hear time and time again on this sub... If you want to build a game dont build a game engine. Their is no problem with redoing all these things that have already been done before. But if your end goal is to create games  times out of the  Unity will be a good choice its going to aid you WAY more than its going to get in your way.,gamedev,cpsujuc,5,t5_2qi0a

3611438,0,t1_cq3q4v5,It is however useful to treat translation rotation and scaling as separate components with their separate interpolations. When I had to code D stuff I typically wrote a transform class which contained a D translation vector a D rotation quaternion and a D scale vector. Matrices were computed out of these by using lazy evaluation if one of the components got changed earlier. When moving something Id just modify the translation vector. Rotation modify the quaternion etc.One nice advantage of this is that the order of operations is fixed and clearly defined. If I modify the rotation it doesnt rotate the translation as well for example. This is something that can get confusing fast with matrices.Also I can apply separate interpolation splines to each component.And it is just much more intuitive to use and much easier to debug.,gamedev,cq3xhyc,3,t5_2qi0a

For the game to be tested the developer would have to go to test someone elses game and post a review for it. Once the review has been posted the developers game would be placed in a queue and would be played by another developer eventually.

It is a long ish humoristic party based first person turn based RPG with an entertaining story almost constant funny banter between the characters in the party an innovative system to avoid save scumming drama stars basically as you do heroic stuff you gain drama stars that give you extra perks but the drama stars themselves are not saved and a homage to games like Might and Magic .It was one of the first games to be added in Greenlight yet it took more than a year to be approved when IMO shittier games were added left and right. I think it is the definition if being undeservedly overlooked.Sadly i understand why some people may be put off for one like most humorous games the humor may not align well with everyone serious and dramatic themes are much easier to align with and secondly the graphics are not only lofi which i wouldnt mind but also tend to clash with each other which actually makes you notice them and the UI art looks as it was lazily thrown in especially the inventory screenI think it is a good example of why impressions and especially avoid clashing art  if you go lofi go lofi for everything if you go comicstyle go comicstyle for everything if you go for s theuiismadeindstudio style go for it in everything matter most people after trying it will like it it was a mostly positive rating after all but the majority seem to ignore it.,gamedev,cqn1due,7,t5_2qi0a

3801890,0,t3_33yskp,Vectors and matrices are of fundamental importance to the field of computer graphics. This series of videos on YouTube gives a pretty good overview of the subject for a beginner.The basic idea is this every point in threedimensional space can be represented as a vector and matrices provide the operations necessary to manipulate those points in a computationally convenient way. You can build matrices which represent sequences of transformationsrotations translations and so onwhich move points through space. Vectors are also important for representing things like the motions of objects through space and for doing things like finding the angles between various objects. So really vectors and matrices are important because they are the building blocks of pretty much all algorithms that work in a threedimensional space.Keep in mind that D graphics these days are just a special kind of D graphics where one of the three dimensions is orthogonal to the camera i.e. pointing directly at you so this still applies even when working in D.My recommendation would be to make sure that you have a firm grasp of basic trigonometry before you go any farther vector operations grow pretty organically out of that.,gamedev,cqpn8zu,2,t5_2qi0a

The overhead of JNI calls is pretty high especially at the granularity of matrix operations. For decent performance you would probably have to be able to batch your operations before making your JNI call.

Apparently the main reason for this is splitting the game into two halves one of which was released much later. As a game dev I wondered if this may have been a mistake on the part of Double Fine.

Check out that YouTube reference I linked you and compare it to how her cat moves. Her cat has no weight the head is fixed in one position the tail and legs just flops around with no real purpose other than moving the cat forward not counting in balance weight or any other factors.I went through her whole tutorial step by step and must say that its toxic compared to what you can find on the internet these days.

3877655,0,t1_cqxw980,Hi The game looks really interesting! So heres my feedback  I think your blurb tries to be too exhaustive and cover everything about the game. It may be good if people want to delve further into the mechanics and try to learn more but as a first impression its just too much. Try thinking about what fantasy people are going to live when they play your game and to articulate that into one short sentence. Who are they in the game and what are they doing should be answered pretty straightforwardly in this sentence.  I also think you would greatly benefit from a landing page instead of having people go straight to the blog. I was immediately overwhelmed by how much content was on the first page. A landing page with your trailer and a short blurb about the game than a link to your blogpresskit and social media info would be perfect.

If the developer doesnt include screenshots or a video and you dont want to take time to download an exe just to check whether its reasonably polished or not dont do any of it.Youre not obligated to play everyones game or even to answer everyones requests if you dont have the time.  Nobody in their right mind should be expecting a  turnaround rate on cold calls.The most helpful thing to do if you dont want to cover a game is to let them know why in vaguegentle terms.

Im working on a top down d game that builds a tilemap for the terrain level procedurally. For my tiles I ended up making a TextureD and applying it to a Quad for the terrain tile level since I didnt want each tile to be a GameObject.As I move on to implementing terrain features e.g. destructible trees openable doors and items units and more... what are the pros and cons to continuing to separate my game logic entirely from the presentation?On one hand it seems like best coding practices Im new to Unity but not as a developer so I like the idea of my game not needing to know anything about how its presented visually. On the other hand it seems like maybe Im reinventing the wheel by making my own system to do things like detect collisions e.g. IsTileOccupied rather than use Unitys collision detection.I know my question is a little amorphous but Im just looking into some broad guidance into shaping my codebase as I move forward.,gamedev,cr4g1a7,1,t5_2qi0a

Maybe you should try to figure out what people use SFML for the most. Because if its mostly for games the library is lacking a lot of things which end up requiring most developers to implement it themselves eg. mipmaps.  Not that Im complaining. SFML offers a lot of things but I still end up requiring to do some lowlevel OpenGL.  Also as ulyptt said staff on the forums generally doesnt care too much or is too hostile.

I like my job and its been comfortable however lately Ive been feeling unfulfilled and it seems like Im running in circles.Ive been in this company for a bit under a year and before that I worked in information security for a government agency. A large portion of the companys success is in part due to stuff I developed and yet I have no stocks or any other benefits other than being paid a salary.I see my future in games and starting my own company some day and I want to go much further than the stuff this company makes and really fulfill myself in the field of indie game dev and get to a point where I can make a living out of it.Currently I am very well paid and this is without any academic experience other than being employed by MoD.I was recently approached by a designer here with similar goals and great ideas for games that wants to partner up and start realizing these ideas. However I fear that our boss will not accept of these projects and both our contracts mention we have to inform the employer of any personal projects we take on and get permission in advance.I know my boss will not be easily convinced to let us do this in part because I asked to start academic studies and convert my work week to an  schedule. Although he agreed he said he will not approve if it hurts my performance here which is understandable.I dont know what do as my current position is comfortable but not fulfilling and as I want to go study  of the week this might be a great student job in the future. However this opportunity with this very talented designer might be missed if I dont go along with this and I might miss a great chance to do what I wanted. I fear if my boss finds out hell kick us both out the door and Ill be left to study while doing a job I like even less.TLDR  I work at a good job with nice pay which is a bit less than fulfilling and plan to study at a college  while working .

TechsTrade universities teach you Applicable Programming while Colleges and more formal Universities focus a lot on theory. What youre doing in an interview sounds like a bit in the middle and both might fail at different parts.But Ill answer these questions as someone who graduated from a program years ago but has mainly worked in IT while doing only a small bit of professional development and mostly hobby development for a few years. gtCould you write a class to implement a linked list dynamically resizing array hash table or tree?Yes.gtCould you write a class to handle analytics messages where the messages are queued up and then sent on a heartbeat to the server?Yes.gtCould you write a class to track multiple spheres moving through space and efficiently calculate when they collide with one another?Efficiency vs Accuracy is a bit of a question mark here but if youre just wanting to know when theyll intersect easy peasy. If you want to know the angle at which theyll bounce off one another if I have to consider the speed and size of the object affecting its odds of intersecting then its a bit more work but yes should be doable.gtCould you write a memory manager for a block of memory with allocation deallocation resizing and defraging?I dont think I could. My degree focused mostly on high end applicable programming a lot of Web Application focus. The only Garbage Collection Ive had to do is at home. Seriously though setting to null and making proper use of using blocks covers  of real world applicationsgtCould you write routines to convert values between integers and strings without using library functions?As in to replace the current parsing and casting functionality as it exists in most languages today? Or do you mean to do your own conversions? I suppose either is possible but I might doubt my ability to perfectly mimic the modern behavior perfectly as there might be some special cases Ive not considered.gtCould you take any one of the main Design Patterns and implement it either in code or pseudocode?Ill be honest and I thought What does he mean by Design Patterns and went straight to Google. Then even after Googling I still dont fully know what you mean it seems to be a bit vague. Which ones are the main ones? I suppose that answers your question either way. gtWhat languages would you be able to do the above tasks in? C Java VB Python PHP javascript. Maybe Perl but Id have to dig out the reference manual. gtWhat other types of tasks would you expect to complete in a programming interview in order to prove you are up for the job?Describe a scenario and Ill give you what the object model breakdown should look like in order to easily implement it whether thats the class hierarchy to increase codereuse or something like an Entity Framework model to utilize with a Database.

Theres no reason to put aside  months of development time if you think you would be happy releasing it at a stage that would only take  months to get to  otherwise it will just become a featurecreep game that never gets finishedreleased.

It might work better for gamephysics engines. For example testing lineline intersection point in triangle. I.e. things that have limited outcomes only my own speculation.I use unit tests for my level files. As the level editor evolves during development and after release Ive found that unit tests is the easiest way to test that all old levels are still readable and have correct values when read and converted into a newer version. But instead of creating tests for every combination I just test some sample stub levels Ive created during development mostly to test the new features if I were to create levels to test everything and every change it would take too long and wouldnt be worth it.

4272739,0,t1_cs75soj,There are a few visual editors on the unity store most extremely cheap like playmaker for example. The are fantastic to use and really make it easy for our artists to do loads of scripting of anything from sounds particles and animations.But some times the programmers use it to create full ai systems and other complex things too.Best thing is they can export the visual code to c scripts.What in a couple lines makes yours better than these alternatives?

4272899,0,t1_cs6i2cl,CTR isnt really metric for analyzing ads. CTR is at best for comparing ad creative materials. And even then really the best metric is tying LTR to each ad so youre evaluating all the resulting revenue from the marketing expense not just how many people took the immediate next step. Would have opted out amp dont mind arent really tests that are useful. My claim is much more specific you make more money showing ads that not showing ads and that calculation is from both retention amp monetization so it includes the loss of users who churn from seeing ads. The game biz is the art of the possible. Do people not like ads? Sure but the business impact of them is very clear positive. Mostly Im just curious what exactly owned channels are.... like... what is that? Can you give some examples? I mean you can make a website for cheap... sure but someone still has to discover that website. You still need to feed that funnel somehow... Same for all other content. Youre still one of hundreds of games released every day. Owned channels doesnt change that brutal supplydemand math. Increasing cost per install isnt just the cost of raw paid installs its a rather reliable indicator of how difficult it is for players to discover your products whether you pay for them or not. Learning is easier but that doesnt make it free or even inexpensive. Its free and easier for everyone else too. In order to learn what methods work you need volume and users are expensive. Just experimenting with a channel requires a few thousand installs otherwise how do you know its not just random chance it worked? The hard part isnt experimenting and learning its prioritizing your limited resources so youre learning whats most helpful and experimenting with what has the best chance to be impactful. Being lean running lots of testsexperiments and innovative sounds like a great plan and heck it is but the market has long past the point where this is a way to dramatically reduce your costs andor run to the head of the pack. Doing this at a highly functional level is required just to compete. ,gamedev,cs79uid,1,t5_2qi0a
4275973,0,t1_cs79uid,Theres a lot of developers and publishers who arent seeing a positive business impact whove wasted a lot of money and arent happy with their paid advertising efforts.I see and hear this a lot.For the most part I agree with what youre saying about ads. Although I believe theres value in measuring CTR tracking clicks through to lifetime retention is deadon.Again Im not saying paid advertising cant work it can.But paid advertising doesnt always have a positive business impact. Ive also seen where success can generate business negatives especially for FP mobile games.Examples of owned media channels are your websites social profiles or mailing list. These are channels you essentially pay nothing to advertise in. Thats in contrast to channels you pay to advertise in such as display advertising social advertising or search engine marketing.For example Activision promoted Destiny with Destiny Planet View a microsite that allowed users to explore and experience the different planets found in the game.Instead of using all their marketing spend on paid advertising directed straight at purchasing Activision considered longterm owned marketing channels that would continue to serve them long after their paid advertising campaigns had stopped.This is a fantastic example of how owned marketing can attract players and how paid advertising can be positioned to champion those efforts instead of used simply to chase players around the internet.There are developers and publishers out there who believe paid advertising is a surefire way to obtain success in game marketing. And I believe thats wrong. I believe long term marketing efforts are worth considering.I understand what Im saying shakes things up. But when I ask developers and publishers what their biggest problem is they all say rising user acquisition cost which typically means paid advertising. And when I ask what they believe the solution is most of them say long term solutions.Hope that helps better communicate what Im saying.Ads are simply a tool not a means to an end. And Im trying to help game developers and publishers realize and I think this could be stated more clearly in my article that where ads can work in the short term that owned marketing channels and techniques can work in both the short term and long term.,gamedev,cs7mcl7,1,t5_2qi0a

Now the balance of work for the rest of the project has shifted heavily toward content creation and of course tuning the new features. I think next week Ill hopefully have added enough items for me to feel comfortable posting it to Feedback Friday. I put in a randomized player for my WIP music as well. I always feel weird making my music play in a game but I just have low selfesteem about it I guess so it feels like Im forcing people to listen to itI think something messed up on this web build its not showing the toon shaders... Unfortunately I cant build a new one until I get home later.Also yesterday I found out about how properties work in C which is think is SUPER NEAT. When a variables value is dependent on that of other variables you can still treat it as a variable instead of a get method. Feels much cleaner to me.Now if I could figure out how to always place objects in the same place above the guardians hands the game would look smoother. Maybe I need to go through the objects and make sure their anchors are at the very bottom so that the position is always based on that. ,gamedev,csbtbyj,2,t5_2qi0a

4359947,0,t1_csgzsbg,Piggybacking on top comment so hopefully more people see this This is one of the main things I try to warn you guys about. Without an agreement a contractor owns everything they make. That means they are only LICENSING the assets to you even after you pay them and you have permission to use it all.The problem is those licenses are revocable and Ive seen contractors hold game hostages this way. Give me a much larger share now or you cant use any of the art I made. If thats said right before launch its a terrifying proposition.Pay  once and get a real solid contractor agreement from an attorney I know a great one that you can use for ALL future contractors with some tweaks each time. If this is a hobby game with a friend fine. But if you are expecting to launch and market it and cross fingers it does well protect yourself properly.No one signed anything is something I want to stop hearing in this subreddit dammit! But I still love you guys no worries ltDISCLAIMER Nothing in this post creates an attorneyclient relationship. This is GENERAL legal guidance.

Did he communicate effectively? Did he meet or exceed deadlines?  How difficult was it to find an artist as good as he is that you could still afford?  Will paying him  allow for you secure the future of your business or will it be too much of a dent in profits to sustain?If after thinking it over you can afford the profit share agreement on a level that allows you to grow your business and his work is worth it then I would recommend going for it.  I would also suggest adding stipulations such as Profit sharing is only for X Years and  or immediately ends upon his resignation from the company If he were to do so.Obviously ignore any statements from people in this thread like fire him and the like.  It really isnt an unreasonable thing for him to ask.  Like I said  Is he worth it?  Can you afford it?  What conditions do you need to apply to make sure he doesnt vanish and become a financial black hole? Thats where stipulations come into place And lastly.

4367864,0,t3_3ax7q7,For number  I really think you are underestimating the speed of these systems these days. GTAV is likely using terrain paging of some sort to store various areas only loading a specific area when youre near. On top of that theres going to be loads of possible optimizations available to them to speed up the process while ensuring that the game loads what the player sees first.If you were wanting to know when to best load assets I can think of two ways to do it Metroid Prime have each room be stored separately. When the player enters a room load the connecting rooms and theyll be in before the player gets to the door. Scene Have a given level be stored as a scene. When the level is loaded load the entire scene in. Apply a healthy dose of mipmapping and LOD and even some asynchronous loading of objects from nearest to furthest if you want to get fancy.Of course there can be other ways to go about it. If your level isnt particularly big you could even just load it all in one go.,gamedev,cshzron,1,t5_2qi0a

4471708,0,t1_cstuxw1,When you say Open Source I assume youre talking about a license that adheres to the OSI Open Source Initiative or FSF Free Software Foundation definitions of the term Open Source.  If this is the case then no absolutely not.  Unreal Engine  is not open source.When you sign up for UE you agree to a very specific license that I will not repeat here.  This license has a number of terms.  The two biggest that would apply here would be terms of revenue and what percentage of your income from any UE game you sell per quarter and redistribution.  The UE license you agree to only gives you redistribution rights to the resulting binary and game assets you produce  You do not have the right to redistribute the source of the UE engine itself.So if your goal is to write an open source game along with an open source engine look elsewhere.  Consider Torque D Godot or maybe one of the GPLd QuakeDoom engines.,gamedev,csubyrd,1,t5_2qi0a

4478030,0,t3_3ceg27,I apologize if this is a basic question. Im going to college in the fall to hopefully major in software engineering the program is small like  people spread across all four years. Ive heard plenty of horror stories about the games industry and so people say to stay away from specialized game programming degrees. At the same time given that places like USC RIT Drexel Full Sail etc. are churning out these people in specialized programs where their homework was to make games  is it even worth trying to break into the industry with a general software engineering degree?Aside from transferring if I decide that I really want to pursue a career in the games industry there is an instate masters program that Ive heard is quite good. Should I just go through the regular software engineering program and then do the game masters program so that I have both skillsets if I decide that I still want to pursue games?,gamedev,csv4i0n,1,t5_2qi0a

4518947,0,t1_cszwh9a,Looks very cool.  This should be on the landing page. It is played on a grid of black and white tiles where each player is restricted to either side. Players flip tiles towards their color to gain control and close in on the enemy. With every action changing the play space each round evolves into a unique battle field.Or maybe an even better explanation.

4523206,0,t1_ct0pbyo,Thanks I think thats a very good insight.  It actually brings up something I also wanted to ask.  You say there are a lot of episodic RPGs where in my experience Ive never seen any.  For clarity I am talking about CRPGs not JRPGs.  What do you think the reason for that is?  Its quite normal for RPGs to have Acts and then the character goes to some new exotic land with each act.  Why cant this be broken up?  I agree that each episode should have its own conclusion but is there a problem with doing Telltale Games style episodic stories within a CRPG?

4605786,0,t1_ctb37dj,gt Discovering arrow keys are for movement could be a satisfying learning experience that youre taking away from your brand new player. And discovering out of the hundred plus keys on the keyboard that shift  arrow keys is sprint? Or that FRMB possibly does nothing until an item is equipped so you need to explore the keyboard again after every big discovery? Perhaps a good compromise in this game would be to have the keys carved into the walltable where youre expected to use an ability. Something incharacter for the game not overtly DIALOGBOXArrow Keys to move!Maybe this would be OK if the theme of the game was just discovering how to control your character in a QWOP style but I expect most people will want to get on to the actual gamestory and not fight controls. Maybe people are just worse at figuring out lower level concepts but are geared up to try some high level incredibly meta nonsense!That said most of the buttons map to The Current Standard but it takes me out of the game to have to go to the keyboard mapping screen to look them up Whats the button for jump? Oh I forgot this game doesnt have jump!. The controls screen is just as much What do the keys do? as it is What abilities do I have?.Edit In case you havent noticed UI is a bugbear for me.

I know the three owners had worked for Looking Glass.  But to leave a company start a competing one and then move back into your old offices?

4756731,0,t1_ctsje2i,How its rendered isnt important to me.  Ive written voxel engines and rendered voxels in different ways.  The distinction is based on the fact that each tile has specific data attached to it.  I mean some tiles are steps some tiles can change colors some tiles can hold an inventory and animate some tiles are cake that you can eat tiles have variable heights tiles have special scripts attached to them.A voxels analogue is a pixel.  You cant texture a pixel. You cant display text on a pixel. Pixels are an element of that rasterized text.  A piece of fence or staircase or stem of a pumpkin can hardly be considered a voxel.

4773875,0,t1_ctw7mme,gt without knowing the unit of distance per unit of time how can you just  tell you the speedIt doesnt.  You need to pick your units.  Typically people choose the units in games to represent meters. Its easy to work with.  From there youd probably pick a frame of reference to mean all speeds are in terms of meterssec.  From there most developers would code up an update that looks like    const Vec windVec      pos  pos  windVec  dtwhere pos is you objects current position vector lt  gt is your wind speed in meterssec and dt is the time in seconds between this frame and the previous frame.gt This equation lost me. Basically a vector is a position or direction directions are typically length  or directionmagnitude and its not relative to anything specific. You have to by convention pick what you want it to be relative to.  This means you may need an origin and you may need N basis vectors to define your N dimensional space.  In games this is typically a d matrix that combines  basis vectors with a th vector for the origin and a th dimension to make the matrix square for other reasons    identityMatrix                             which you can think of as  vectors left up at pos where the identity matrix should map to the world coordinate system youd think of in terms of the basis you call x y and z.If you change any of the top x matrix then you redefine what left up and at are thus redefining what a direction means.  For instance if Im not facing the same direction as you then moving forward means something different to each of us    myMatrix                                  origin  lt   gt    localDirection  lt   gt    yourPos  origin  identityMatrix  localDirection      myPos  origin  myMatrix  localDirection  You end up at lt   gt however my at is your left so Ill end up walking to your left and end up at lt   gt.If you change any of the right most x then you redefine what your position is.  Thus my final matrix would be                            And thusly you need to define in which coordinate system youre looking at your vector in terms of with the world coordinates and xyz basis being the one you want everything to end up in to display it.,gamedev,ctwafla,2,t5_2qi0a

4909066,0,t1_cuas3ff,So I got the three hats and played until over  coins.  This is obviously some type of art game but man does that title not interest me in the slightest haha.  After reading your comments I see that the title was picked for you. I think you fit that title well.  My favorite part was reading the two phrases that were stitched together. A majority of the time it seemed like some profound saying that was trying to make a commentary on society.   Im not really sure what to say I didnt find it enjoyable from the beginning. I started slightly enjoying myself once I realized the phrases were kind of cool. Allowing jump and go to the left without using them at all seemed a little weird though not allowing you to go left would also seem strange. I did use left a few times to go back and read some of the phrases that were too long for me to read quickly when I was just holding down the right arrow.   Maybe if the number of coins in each hallway section grew by a few each time it may keep attention more and it wont ruin your whole strip out all the gameplay and just have coins and achievements.  Not really sure what else to say so definitely let me know if you have any questions or want further explanations on anything.,gamedev,cudboyn,1,t5_2qi0a
4918479,0,t1_cuds5wa,Try implementing recycling amp reusable resources all over your game to minimize creationsdisposes. You could also funnel them with a background thread. Have a thread that loads enemies one at a time so that at no point  enemies will all try to load simultaneously. Theyll instead be forced to load one at a time spreading out the CPU time to prevent lag spikes. I applied that technique to bullet travel and even line of sight. That way if  soldiers all just happened to shoot at the same exact millisecond you wont see a lag spike. I think my balance for Mobile devices was  so I had  threads running calculating bullet travel physics. So even if  guns shoot at the same exact millisecond there would only be  being calculated at a time in  separate threads. The rest waited a few milliseconds In a Queue. I love that aspect of game development. Its so much different than enterprise app development. When I started I was doing the same thing creating on the fly. As you did i quickly moved to recycling charactersenemies from within a pool and just reloading their weapons amp changing models. The performance increase after removing creatingdisposing during gameplay was amazing! I was able to add more enemies per screen than I expected would be possible! I was able to make my situation work with garbage collection but yours may be a different situation. Come to think of it I recycle and reuse almost everything and loadingdisposing for when youre not doing something CPUGPU intensive like transitioning to a new scene. Even my destructible environment is all using recyclable objects os I dont have to create or dispose of anything during gameplay. ,gamedev,cueigov,2,t5_2qi0a

Anyways through my learning those languages I have learned that programming is interesting and I do enjoy the idea of it. Thebprpblem right now is I have been thinking of some other possibilities . I mainly want to become a programmer to go into game development. Here is here my question comes .... What job does a programmer have on creating games whats the job called that makes the graphics characters and story and which job is best for me? So basicly I love the idea of creating the story characters and all that stuff. I find it awesome to come up and create those things. I hear that game engines are a big part of game development but what does a programmer do then?

Artists who have great portfolios will produce stuff you cant use.   Make sure you have a contract that gives you full rights.  Youre paying for the work dont buy a license. Look for someone who does everything you need dont try to split it up Concept d d etc Start them off with a small contract really small.  Picture a small contract then chop that in half then in half again.  Assume the first contract will be flushed down the toilet. Make sure your contracts have break points.  That you can basically pull the rip cord.  If the art is coming in off spec pull that shit.  Dont hope the artist pulls it together with the final revs.  Its hard finding an artist extremely hard.

That alone is a success.Thanks man it felt that way until I saw the numbers! Still though it was a great experience overall.gtFirst of all last year  games launched per DAY on iOS  per day on Android. Thats an insane amount of clutter to cut through and without marketing of some sort you had no chance. The low downloads arent about your game youve got a bunch of star reviews unless theyre just your buddies or something .That sure puts it into perspective huh. You forget just how many games are out there because like mine theyre not sticking out and you dont even know about e. Thats some sort of confirmation bias cool to see it in action albeit not working in my favour at all.gt Maybe its a contest where  winners will have their face recreated in the game I dont know  the point is that really successful marketing draws on the strengths of the product and the attitudes and interests of the target audience rather than just pulling the same tired old levers hoping people respond. Thats a really clever way of doing it actually that would work out for me and the people playing my game. I just need to find a platform to host it on but I think I know just the youtuber.gtIn other words dont look at it as UA because that turns it into a mechanical heartless process of separating humans from their money whereas good marketing causes people to THROW their money at you.I think youre onto something trying to keep it fresh and inspired instead of doing everything everyone else is doing.gtIts a simple little game with a bit of humor and a dark cheeky vibe.Thanks for this too.

It isnt a high turnover job so youll likely need to hunt for an extended time and get to know the people well to find their need long before they reach out to the public looking for applicants or just be very lucky to be hunting at the time theyre searching.

5186120,0,t1_cvb3qh6,Yeah GoT is a good example. Its directpay you pay HBO a specific bill or you pay specifically for the DVDs.  I think directpay is the best model for obvious reasons but its also inherently limited.  Most properties couldnt command that price. GoT can because its phenomenally well made and appeals to a demographic with a high propensity to spend and it faces somewhat limited competition they have exclusive rights to the GoT property so other shows compete tangentially.Now think about say news websites or social networks or flash games.  Few of them individually can command direct payment.  So in a world where advertisement dollars are few and far between this content either withers away or advertisement becomes more heavily integrated like advertorials were seeing now in news sites or content producers have to come up with another way to monetize.  Or I guess another option is that like content merges together and e.g. one online news source survives off of the subscriptions of everyone who is willing to pay a subscription fee.Technology does affect the revenue available to a market which in turn affects how much attention that market is given by producers.   years ago you had to subscribe to a newspaper.  x the monthly cost you currently pay for Netflix.  Now that revenue stream has dried up because you can get your news online.  And with it newspapers across the country are going out of business or merging.  As internet advertising dollars dry up well see another shift.And to your RIAA example some would say their fears were wellfounded.  Overall industry revenue is down loads from their peak.I agree it wont be a bad thing for consumersif we deign ourselves to pay for the content worth consuming.

A good engine should lead you down a path of success not a path of misery.Now that isnt to say Unity is overall a bad engine because of this inherent flaw in their EC design there are definitely ways around this flaw some more heavyhanded than others.

Playing the game that way is good but read this blog post and go back for a second playthrough. This game is seriously beautiful and I loved it so much. Why cant more games be like this? Games dont even need to be walking simulators to have this good of a story. Anyway Davey Wreden also did a talk at some college about how game developement affected him personally and it really gave me some insight I never thought Id find. Also there was one bit where he was talking about how his roommate Robin said When Im around you I feel physically ill so that brings light to that quote and the meaning behind For R. Anyway Daveys since been in therapy so I think hes doing a lot better than Stanley Parable times.Edit I feel like people saying its not worth the money didnt play it with the mindset that you need to actively think and dwell on the ideas and questions that the game challenges you with. Theres a lot more here than just a walking simulator and theres more to game design than just fun game mechanics and replayability. This game heavily relies on enviroments context and what your told about what youre doing to tell a captivating and relatable story. And it should be a relatable story if youve ever doubted yourself strived for validation from external sources or even just been straight up depressed. But thats just me.

Thats all normal I think. Maybe not for everyone but I know amongst my group of music friends one of the biggest challenges for years was just finishing a single song! I mean shit... That was my biggest insecurity for years with music  I accumulated a massive drive of unfinished songs and I thought that meant I wasnt disciplined enough to be a successful musician.What I found over time is that I needed to have little successes. Someone else posted that you should scale it down.... Try it. Pick something really small to code. When I was coding I started off with little things like a tweak for a game. Or try a code a helper app for something you do every day on your computer... Dont force yourself to stick to games all the time. With music instead of building a whole song I would just try and copycat a little ten second loop of an artists song I liked.Another thing  your depression you mentioned  I honesty think the most successful creative people have some sort of mental issue.

Especially the fact that Phase deteriorates over time makes it difficult to use them. You can easily arrive at a situation where you get knocked back or just delayed long enough to lose all your Phase and then the only way of getting more is to kill an enemy without access to your special abilities.If it did not deteriorate over time Phase would instead be a resource that the player would have to decide how to use. Can I kill this enemy without using Phase and save it for the more difficult ones or could I afford to use it now?Regardless of this I think the ideas are quite cool and you should definitely go on and develop them further!,gamedev,cw9uv6i,3,t5_2qi0a

5488249,0,t1_cwcyako,Im not sure if theres some confusion here or not so Ill just clarify if there is. This isnt an endless runner its an autorunner with designed levels. This is the first level so its all pretty easy here this is the only revamped levels so far but it gets more complex as you go.Every time you warp forward you have to wait for the screen to catch up with you so thought needs to go into managing space and pattern matching to complete the levels.The perceived speed is a valid issue and I think this can be addressed pretty easily. Ill consider if theres a good fit for any within the levels. Thanks for your feedback!,gamedev,cwd6aa7,1,t5_2qi0a

5489878,0,t3_3qa17d,You should have a list of features you need to do in order to consider the game complete. Looking ahead at the full list can you make the current design work for you.If you see a design flaw and you know future features will be patchy then rewrite. If you have doubts about the design handling feature x prototype the complex bit now as best you can and see how the design lends itself to the task.Bottom line if the design will work to implement new features keep it. Youre just rewriting it for your own love of designing and planning. If its not going to work rewrite straight away and learn from the design gaps so you dont hit the same problem later This is the real trick to being a good programmer and it takes time to get it right.,gamedev,cwddsk5,3,t5_2qi0a

5513055,0,t1_cwg18jc,Sorry its not terminology that I would normally use I was only using it in reference to this video That video was referring to this article which basically says that its the consumers fault that we dont have more good games on mobile.Essentially what I meant by core games was your standard games FPS or x or shmups or fighting games or generally things you think of when you think Video Game.  As opposed to things that you think of when you think Mobile game.  The argument from TB was that the control scheme capabilities and use case for the mobile devices fails when you try to use it for more serious genres.  That the best games are the ones that embrace the platform.  I agree with that its better than trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. My point was that touch displays arent inherently a bad control system theyre just insufficient on their own.

5621270,0,t1_cwt453t,The reason processors use expandedbit precision is so that rounding errors do not propagate to bit space.If you add two bit numbers together you can get up to  bits of data for the result.  Same for subtraction.If you multiply two bit numbers together you can get up to bits of data for the result.  Using bits for the intermediate is just the processors way of making sure that no error propagates enough to affect the precision of the floating point math.  Same with division.Why they use  bits instead of  bits is probably due to the fact that they may also use the same FPU for bit calculations.  Rounding an bit result to  bits drops  bits but  bits to  bits only drops .,gamedev,cwtvf00,5,t5_2qi0a

5659113,0,t3_3smhix,GalacDecks  CCG in Space Unity Web PlayerThis is a project I started early this year put aside then started up again in September. This version is for the Unity Web Player but the target is PC Mac and mobile.Right now the game has limited features and cards but demonstrates the basic game interaction.Im interested in any and all feedback. Theres currently no tutorial so here are the basic instructions or just dive in and see if you can figure it out First player to destroy the opponents homeworld wins. You can play units and powers from your hand if you have the necessary resources Energy amp Minerals. Units can attack the turn after theyre played if the target isnt blocked by a defending unit in front. At the end of each turn you choose between increasing energy increasing minerals or drawing  cards.For anyone interested Ive made the source code available on GitHubThe client is developed in Unity so it should portly fairly easily to multiple platforms currently Im focused on Android although for ease of testing the link above is to the WebPlayer requires the Unity plugin and a browser that supports it.The server is developed in Java . Card rules are written in Javascript and processed by Javas new Nashorn engine. The idea is to allow for easy card creation without requiring a new server build although at this early stage in development a lot is up in the air for featuresmechanics. You can check out the rules for cards in the current build hereThe client talks to the server over a websocket using the WebSocketSharp.dll in Unity.,gamedev,cwykg65,3,t5_2qi0a

It is a bit on the smaller side for modern smartphones which I prefer and it is a bit older Ive had it for about  years now.I do think screen resolution was an issue. I did have trouble seeing far enough around me to aim properly and I noticed a long delay maybe . seconds between falling off the bottom of the screen and the ad coming up which I assume happens right when I fail.I think the main reason why you have people leaving after only a few play sessions is difficulty. It is hard but not in a rewarding way like Dark Souls Skate Ninja Gaiden etc. There is no strong emotional reward for success the thrill of pulling it off but it is hard to do.Were this my game I think I would try to start off with really easy levels are there even levels?

5720428,0,t3_3th9uj,For me this would completely depend on the game I was trying to make and why.  If Im trying to create my own engine from the bottom up going for highend graphics physics AI and general speed C is the obvious answer.  Low level access to your hardware just short of ASM and is still the language of choice for many AAA titles.  Unfortunately this flexibility allows you almost too much freedom.  Easy to create vague bugs memory leaks pointer problems etc.  But for when you absolutely must kill every motherfker in the room...  If Im trying to make a game to fit EVERY platform with a rapid development cycle?  Unity D.  Were pretending its available then.  More of a fully wrapped engine with a robust scripting language behind it.  Now supports Javascript.  Can easily port to almost any platform out there.  If Im just tooling around to make something fun for my own enjoyment that doesnt need to be too resource heavy?  Basic D or advanced D  Java.  Works on most platforms has come a long way in the past decade fairly easy to use and with some nice features that allow you to worry a bit less not not at all about memory leaks and whatnot.Online networked eg MMO type game?  Hard to call.  Depends on the same requirements for clientside Id probably go with .NET for serverside just due to the socket programming difficulty and that most of its been taken care of for you now.This is more of a the right tool for the job type of thing.,gamedev,cx66brw,1,t5_2qi0a

I think the simplest solution in concept though probably the toughest in execution is a smooth but relatively steep difficulty curve and a fast enough pace that most people wont want to grind unless they get stuck.  FFs last dungeon comes to mind with its infamous spike in difficulty.  The thing is though apart from a few bullshit attacks that plague most of the game playing straight through its actually a pretty great experience if you get in the right mindset.  Each encounter in that dungeon has to be treated as a boss and the final boss isnt actually significantly harder than his minions.  This is where the pacing comes into play.  The rest of the game has a few unwarranted difficulty spikes and a few particularly slow segments really put you in the mindset of grinding to advance.  If the moon were in a different context it would probably be loved but with how the game sets it up adjust everybody immediately thinks oh Ive got to grind a bunch to get through here and are then faced with a ton of monotony followed by a then disappointingly easy final boss.I feel like I wasnt constructive enough but I also feel like thats a pretty good outline of the problem and would give a launch point for solutions for particular games at least along the JRPG strain.  I would ramble more but Ive got to go.,gamedev,cxhulzd,2,t5_2qi0a

5816610,0,t1_cxhvpzv,As a gamedev this seems like a prototype more than a game  We can only see the combat state where you have players fighting on an empty background and the sensei talking which isnt really interesting from a players point of vue.  We also can see a cusor in the trailer which feels weird.    As a gamer I feed that a ninja game should feel more actionpaced. Id like to see ninjas running fast the current move and attack speed seems slow. In the last part of the video we can see an enemy ninja attacking from behind this is awesome this is the Ninja feeling I want.  As a first game this is a nice start the content is there but the immersive part isnt.Tldr Ninjas are fast the gameplay seems slow,gamedev,cxi3s98,2,t5_2qi0a

5835619,0,t1_cxk7zga,Ah. Well this here is pretty much the same as stuff posted already but it wouldnt hurt to see the code written a little differently. I also had difficulty searching for CG shader stuff since the name is so generic. Try HLSL since its pretty much the same a CG anyways.Usually the blending of  colors requires a lerp or a mix in glsl and the lerp factor is the alpha mask of your image map. To blend a third color people usually take the result of the first blend and lerp it with color  using a second alpha mask as the factor. And so on and so forth.On a side note linear dodge is exactly the same as an add blend.I may have misunderstood some questions so feel free to ask for elaborations or clarity.,gamedev,cxkkro4,2,t5_2qi0a

I am currently developing a game and I came across a design problem I am not sure  the best way to solve it. The game is a dungeon crawler at least I think that is what the name of the genre is albeit Id like to test against the players laziness. There is no particular type of laziness just laziness in general. Any idea what I can do to see whether or not the player is being lazy?Setting context etc... are all flexible so dont be afraid to suggest anything if you want.

5928275,0,t3_3wi0aj,One possible solution that clearly wont work for all games but could work for games that have a fairly fixed environment like Mario Kart or Smash Brothers is that the game records some interval of actions from each player and in the event of a disconnection an AI takes over doing its best to repeat the actions and and locations of the disconnected players looping actions. It certainly wont be as good as if the player was there but assuming that the loop is long enough the player actions may not be robotically predictable even though they are conforming to a predictable loop. If a player doesnt reconnect for an extended period of time Im sure players will be able to figure out the loop and take advantage of it but it would be different for each player and if the player disconnects multiple times each game each loop would be different as well. It would be more effective than simply leaving the character to idle and I think it would be more interesting to play against than a crafted AI as well as easier to implement.,gamedev,cxwq7z4,2,t5_2qi0a

6036985,0,t1_cyaxg44,At one point I had a brake button but ended up removing it. The ship would either have to turn around to thrust to opposite direction of movement which would make it too slow and unusable or magically just slow movement speed no matter where the main thrusters are facing which felt too unrealistic. I also wanted to keep the number of buttons down to absolute minimum.I tried to solve the problem by adding artificial drag to slow down ships movement but then it felt like flying in water not in space.Finally I just added a relatively low limit to maximum speed so that the ships stay in players control. Im quite happy with the result but youre definitely not alone with your opinion. I would like to make it easier to slow down but I dont know how to do that without compromising the somewhat realistic thruster based movement..If I may ask for one more favor could you send me a private message with the game log in CUsersltusernamegtAppDataRoamingastronauticsapplication.log.

6067692,0,t3_3ykg77,I would say keep good practices in mind but dont go absolutely crazy trying to prevent every form of hacking. If people spend long enough they will always find a way to hack it. What you dont want to do is compromise the fun factor of the game by making it more hackproof.Theres basically a tradeoff. You can either rely more on the clients allowing for better performance since the server doesnt need to handle all the work or rely more on the server allowing for more accurate and less hackable calculations since there is one reliable source to handle it all.In general try to be more relative than absolute. Rather than having a client say I am moving to XY have the client say I moved up. The server should know where the client was and how fast they should move. This isnt hackproof though since now someone could mess with the client to spam I moved up messages to the server so the server would also need to know the frequency at which a player should be sending these messages and disregard them if they come too soon.Overall dont kill yourself over this. If you end up working so long on this part that the core of the game is neglected its not worth it. Many games dont bother trying to prevent players from doing this stuff simply because it can be a futile effort.

6085951,0,t1_cyhbmjb,First of all start here and sort all entries for what best fits your game so dont include sites that review mobile games when you develop a PC game obiously. A similar list can be found here although you have to sign up for it.So now you have a whole bunch of delicious contact info for reviewers. Now what do you send them? Youre pretty much right with making a press kit and pitching it to them. Not much more that you can do.The way you do it is extremely important though. Heres where indies again in my opinion have a great advantage over large companies. You can make it as personal as you see fit. Large companies will always send reviewers very formal emails requesting that they write about very specific things and sending them a very specific press kit for it. Basically what you want to do is assemble a nice little presskit that you want the press to write about. Put in any screenshots trailers playable demos anything you think might be relevant that you have available right now. Once youve got that together youre gonna bundle it all together in a nice winrar file and put it in the attachment.Heres where its your time to shine. In the email subject and the body of your email be yourself. This is something large companies cannot do but you can. Show in that message that there is a person behind this game that youre making. If youre a funny guy include a little joke in the email. Show who you are and why you are making this game and not something else.A second thing you should definitely do is make it personal. Lets say youre reaching out to Bob Bobertson from SuperAwesomeGames.com and you know hes an incredible Nintendo fanboy allude to that fact in your email. An exampleHey Bob BoberstonIm SnakesOnAShip and I like making videogames! Im currently developing Fiddle Players Deluxe and have included some of my work in the attachment.

Rebind if ya want! D Yup! Each character has a more indepth tutorial that goes into detail for their moves in the Tutorials option on the Main Menu. After having trouble with people knowing what to do in the game I implemented the FirstTime Setup screen that gets shown first when the game is booted on a fresh computer. This is meant to make it so that if a player randomly presses buttons they will probably end up in the tutorial like you found out. There is also an option to modify the graphics in case people dislike the retro TV FX. Ive tried to make that page fairly understandable if you read the text it should be clear what to do and you can disable the screen from ever showing up again by selecting the toggle underneath the Main Menu button. If you go back to the page does it make more sense on a second look? Im glad you think so! I hear you on the obtuse controls but I dont think that would be a good alternative.  One of the main ways to get good with the sniper is to do snap shots where you quickly fire off bullets from your firing pose e.g. roll through an attack and fire as soon as you emerge and perform air shots firing while jumping over enemies and you couldnt perform either with that change. Plus itd be much harder to specifically time when your bullets are fired.It really does! I appreciate you taking the time.,gamedev,cyjie3n,1,t5_2qi0a

6117580,0,t3_3z9sbu,Ive found that Ive only been enjoying playing more only because Im not really good at creating. And when I try to create its hard to stay focused.

6119601,0,t3_3z9sbu,It might be because Ive gotten a lot older but I think I enjoy developing games more. Mainly because it feels great when you go I want my game to have this thing or I want this kind of attack for a boss and then actually accomplish that. To be able to finally develop my own games has been a childhood dream of mine but for the longest time it just wasnt possible without premade engines like Unreal and Unity to make good quality games. That being said I still love playing games but I definitely feel its more of how Michio Kaku said how he sees the world differently as a physicist. Now that I understand how a lot of things work in games I pay much closer attention to how studios made the game rather than focusing on the gameplay. I guess you could say its fun in a more mature manner. After all I find once you get a feel of a challenge its hard to go back to something easier and enjoy it. ,gamedev,cyl8hde,1,t5_2qi0a

It also helps in balancing everything if it is handled by a single .exe.Otherwise you need to specify and handle the port balancing in the matchmaking application which to me sounds like an unneeded task.You simply have the gameServer.exe run multiple threads for each matchand probably several threads for each player.For the need of monitoring that is completely up to the developer how they want to structure it there are ways around and through this solution sadly I dont have them. ,gamedev,cyvh3v0,1,t5_2qi0a

The community is sadly nonexistent at this point but hopefully in time that changes.Im not generally so gushy about game engines but this one just impressed me greatly.

Depending on the game you may need different levels of client prediction  dead reckoning to get it to look right. Also not everything needs to be identical on every client. Things that directly affect gameplay should be as accurate as you can get it but everything else can just be handled purely on the client.

6302753,0,t3_41xub3,Well there are a few problems Problem  Python is inefficient compared to other programming languages.Depending on the size of your game this may or may not be a problem. Certainly you wouldnt want to develop something huge and resource intensive in python but if its a simple D game you can get away with that inefficiency. Problem  The user has to have python to run it.You can get around this by using a builtin python interpreter or just bundling python with your game on Steam. The first is the only real option if youre not releasing on Steam though since you dont want to make your users download other things to play your game. Problem  Not a lot of devs use python.The more devs use the technology youre using to develop your game the easier of a time youll have since you can use their APIs and solutions to problems plus you can more easily get advice. Python just... isnt popular enough with game devs. Problem  You cant easily keep others from reading your code.Sure you can obfuscate it with plenty of utilities but while that makes it hard to read it doesnt actually prevent them from looking through it. This isnt a problem if you dont care if others read your code but if you do...Overall Id just try and learn a different programming language.

Getting caught up about truths of the human condition IMO is a surefire way to get stuck on the art aspect and ensure that youll never launch it because youll never be happy with your own expression of said truths.  As a teacher I dont start getting my narrative writing students to improve their craft by getting them to fundamentally explore the human condition.  I get them to write small short stories.  We then iterate.  When you are starting out the single hardest thing you will learn is everything about the process of finishing something up as a releasable product.

6362142,0,t1_czcedqu,I dont think you would render the whole screen with a single tile. I have ran into this problem with SDL and worked around it by making the tiles bigger or preparing larger textures with tiles already filled up.Now lets be fair The problems were only visible when trying to run game in x resolution at fps with  draw calls per frame on a year old Coreduo CPU with integrated Intel GPU. I still wanted the game to run on it as I own such machine and wanted that to be the minimum hardware spec so it had to run at fps instead of fps SDL was able to pull off. TLDR unless you want perfect performance on a year old computer with integrated GPU SDL is fine for any D project.,gamedev,czcszlo,1,t5_2qi0a

Big explosions screen shake etc. are all part of the fun.This happens a lot in Hearthstone. You want to attack something the card already moves a little to the front frightening the other party. You attack. The card quickly moves forward the screen shakes the damage splatters onto the enemy card in a big red number and you feel awesome just because you did that.Every single move should feel and look amazing. Thats a real driver in CCGs because it gives you the feeling your are awesome. It also works viceversa If you come back strong after a bit of a downfall youll feel extra powerful because you just beat that other person and put the match in your favor.Keep up the great concept and keep moving it forwards! It sounds really interesting so far!,gamedev,czgl9bp,2,t5_2qi0a

6496481,0,t1_czr512u,It eventually becomes a cost analysis. If I dont want a silly splash screen and I expect to make decent money out of a game I need to pay for Unity. Unity also has several other problems. For instance If I wanted working point lights that allowed me to change the shadow bias without huge gaps between objects and shadows in unity Up until Dec last year I would have had to write my own lighting engine. This was a problem in Unity for  years. A major lighting issue took  years to get fixed. Anyone without any experience writing such things had absolutely no solution to that problem. Now if I am having to rewrite a lot of Unity to get it to do what I want to do then at some point really Im not using much of Unity at all. At that point its just going to be better to write my own engine or use a very basic framework. The whole point of Unity is to be able to make games quickly without worrying or fussing about the underlying systems. If you are having to rewrite those underlying systems or work around them then they are a hindrance and the engine is failing at its purpose. Unity and similar fully integrated environments are great at being OK but they dont really excel in anything because they are designed to be as general purpose as possible they can get people making games within a few days. But they do have drawbacks and some pretty substantial flaws. Also People who learned to program in such environments arent likely to have the knowledge of how the back end works to fix the issues they come across. The level of programming you need to make a game in unity is relatively very simple compared to the stuff that goes on in the back end of that engine.,gamedev,czra8ll,2,t5_2qi0a

6554112,0,t3_45d2ez,So Ive been building up a collection of OpenGL functionalities in Java using lwjgl that may someday qualify as a game engine but for now i just call it my gl library.  The way I got started and the way Im progressing is by creating a least of capabilities I need and getting them working.  So for example Get a window displaying a triangle with the ability to close the window by pressing the ESCape key. Get a shader loader going and move the triangle rendering into the shader. Get the triangle rotating and moving. Start rendering a d cube instead of a triangle. Get a camera working to fly around the cube. Texture the d cube instead of fixed colors. Get text rendering onto the screen to show debug messages. Get D HUD type components rendering on the screen Get height map based ground quads working Get a basic OBJ model loader working and displaying Get mouse picking workingand so forth.  I have been working on this nights and weekends for quite some time and as I learn more I go back and rework code based on new knowledge.    I keep this todo list in my source code and work on the next task until it is done.Now to come up with the task list I gave myself a target application that I want to eventually write nothing huge or fancy but something that would need all the pieces Im building.The nice thing about doing it this way is each time I complete one of the tasks which might result in me adding more tasks I feel a sense of accomplishment which keeps me working on it.,gamedev,czx8yiq,1,t5_2qi0a

6672747,0,t1_d09hdys,I have worked a lot with cellular automata and tried something similar to this. Basically you choose a starting value for each cell and fix this value. Then you choose an arbitrary value for example  for the other cells. Then you interpolate between values of adjacent cells. In the case of a bicubic interpolation you eventually reach a stable smooth curve with no changes to the values per step as long as your derivatives are well behaved. However it takes a lot of steps since the change in value per step decreases as the value nears the optimal value. Also for simplicity I usually use a cyclic border condition where you wrap around the edge and the index of neighbor is index modulo the size of the array in D.,gamedev,d09ipy0,2,t5_2qi0a

6687507,0,t3_4788pl,Its worth mentioning the Leapfrog integratorIt is perhaps the simplest integrator there is  Update position using the latest velocity.  Then update the velocity using the latest position.This also like verlet has the advantage that its time reversible so it shouldnt on average heat anything up. It is also easy to preserve angular momentum using this. Thats what I use in my game www.iotapersei.com  although Ive adjusted it to allow variable timesteps dt update positions using latest velocity  dt   update velocities using latest position and dt update positions using latest velocity  dt  This is still a leapfrog integrator but it means that if timesteps are changed things dont jitter about quite as much. Its still reversible which is the key to energy conservation. It does have energy problems I would admit when there are contact points often because you do need to put in fudges to update position and velocity together but thats largely because I have to allow for long timesteps s max but this comes down to how you solve the more fiddly bits.,gamedev,d0b1ou2,1,t5_2qi0a

6696918,0,t3_47ciy6,I personally havent implemented anything like that and I also have not such a big knowledge about that topic but in my opinion the best way to stop cheaters is to really only send the needed things to the clients. This would stop people from wallhacking and all such stuff but that would become complex. Also try to verify input from user clients and check with your server if the thing they sent you is valid like they said they just jumped with a velocity that will propel them  meter high when in fact they are already in the air that should rais a flag For me it sounds like you want to have a tool like VAC which looks out what kind of programs are running so you could ban the users. In my opinion Just dont do that. Valve is a multi billion dollar company and their games still have hacks written for them and VAC evolved over years. If I remember correctly they search your RAM while you are running a game only to look for malicious progams.So I dont like that VALVE does that what do you think would happen if every indie game inspects your RAM? I woulnt trust that game any longer and probably wont buy it.I wouldnt like it and I bet you wouldnt either. And now cheate writers even started writing cheats INTO the OS kernel so they cant be detected  So if you arent working at a big publisher try to keep the info on the client pcs as low as possible and that should help a bit.,gamedev,d0c0pa7,0,t5_2qi0a

6711314,0,t3_47ieul,Regret it big YouTubers rarely care about playing your game.It can be a blessing for promotion but a curse to your reputation as a game developer.Dont get me wrong many YouTubers with a large audience come from a good place and I am glad for your success with one. I enjoy watching other fellow game developers put their game out there and succeed. This is more of a meditation on a subject rather than personal criticism or anything done out of ill will. I have respect for my fellow gamedev brethren and sistren.I understand your enthusiasm as a beginner indie developer. The excitement of showing your first game to the world can be overwhelming. But sometimes it can unknowingly lead to some decisions that in the long run will characterize your name or your companys name in a light that you may not particularly wish for.Truth is if some of them werent doing wha they do they wouldnt be this big. They know they feast on the audience of young teenagers who are in their rebellious stage and even as adults they themselves imitate their behavior by using your game guys that you put hours of your life and love into. You the inventive crowd who have a special love for creativity which should not be dishonored in such a way.Ive met some of the most inspired game devs ever at rgamedev who are  year olds just honest and passionate about the craft. But when its put out on those channels it becomes something else that has nothing to do with creativity. YouTubers profit more from a game than the developer and they are the ones asking to pay to feature your game on their channel?I just watched Markeplier and I felt bad for the game developer and didnt really want my game to be treated that way. It had a feel of This game is purely crap but I am going to use it to entertain you guys and get all attention I can. Thing is the game was x better designed than most of us can here. Imagine putting a work of love into their hands and feel the amount of insult as a game developer who spent many long years just to learn how to build a decent game.Because I love the little things about games I love forloops making things move on the screen and all the meticulously crafted enemies bullet mechanics and all else that hours of brainstorming went into. Game developers are a good crowd of people who have a passion for making things. Yet some guy on YouTube ruins all that in  seconds by making your work of love look worthless to the world. And pretty much make fun of your game outside of even considering indulging in progressing through meticulously crafted gameplay in a calm and content manner.I want to PR my game and submit it to outlets that treat games with respect who are ran by people who care about gameplay and the craft of making games. This way you can hope for a realistic review of what the developer has done and value assessment can be done in a healthy waySome of the big YouTubers wouldnt be able to tell what constitutes for a good game and provide a false impression of the game. They rarely can determine if the game is actually innovative or not. They are good entertainers but they might see innovation as a bug or see it as a copy of another game they played just because some of its parts look similar. Whereas totally missing the point that a feature in a niche genre is considered an innovation because it has never been done in that particular genre or style. And these are the types of things that actually matter.If you dont care about the idea of your game to be presented in a totally distorted way where gameplay mechanics ignored and a lot of your hard work is dishonored... if you dont care about these types of things at all then it actually sounds like an interesting ordeal. Not all game developers fall into same category either neither bad nor good just different. If you are okay with those things then go ahead.i think that in certain cases YouTuber broadcasters should require a written license from the developer to take just about any game on their channel and undermine its value by ridiculing it in exchange for attention and cumulative growth of their channel.,gamedev,d0di9zs,9,t5_2qi0a

Games such as Clash of Clans have nailed it IMO because you can still play te game and do well without paying. Also Clash of Clans is free to play whuch further excuses it. The problem only arises when the micro transactions affect a major game mechanic in such a way that forces the player to spend their money. A good example of this is Dragon Quest. In that game they added a second currency that could only be obtained by spending real money. This currency could then be used to buy OP weapons thus giving an unfair advantage to the paying players over the nonpaying players.,gamedev,d0hbk2s,1,t5_2qi0a

Pygame is also very lowlevel which isnt necessarily a bad thing but theres a lot of prep work you need to do to get even a basic game up and running.I would highly recommend using LVE a game development framework that uses Lua a language that is super easy to learn and is one of the fastest interpreted languages out there. It only takes a few lines of code to get a basic game up and running and distribution is simple and easy. The most recent version of LVE includes support for Android and iOS in addition to Windows OSX and Linux.I am speaking as someone who was in a very similar position to OP a few years ago. After struggling for a couple years with Python and Pygame I took the plunge with LVE and have never looked back.,gamedev,d0qak2a,2,t5_2qi0a

6831556,0,t1_d0ql8jd,Hi HarryI recommend that the first contact to any app submission not be your sales team pushing paid products. Of said pushed products perhaps a package that includes premium reviews not be of those products pushed when an application is submitted.I get that Pocket Gamer needs to make money. You make money by selling advertisement space and selling promotional packages of varying degrees. By having the sales group being the first to reply back to an application submission first Pocket Gamer gives off the impression that its likely necessary to buy something to secure a review. Im trying to consider both sides here and it doesnt look good. Most games submitted to Pocket Gamer arent going to be reviewed. Thats a given accepted fact that everyone making games understands. The part that deserves the note is that as a game developer submits their application their first contact back will be a sales pitch to buy something. Most game developers wont get a second contact back because either the request email material game didnt make the cut. Pocket gamer isnt going to spend money on replying to every submitted game for review that didnt make the cut.So that leaves a developer who submitted an app with only a sales pitch one which includes a package can give the impression that it increases the likelihood they get reviewed. That puts Pocket Gamer in that sketchy grey area where one starts to question whether or not an advertising package is needed to get reviewed.So we agree that you should never ever pay anyone to review your game. Lets also agree that there are two separate contact channels at Pocket Gamer one for inquiring about advertising and a second for submitting an application for review. Contact at the second should not be getting a reply from the first. Thanks for replying Harry. Every site which replied back with a sales pitch got that note that theyll ask for money. The ones which put payment options on the app submission section got put in their own special category. I understand that historically it might not have been that way. Maybe the experiences of a small few who have submitted their app slipped through a policy hole over there and someone in sales over stepped their boundaries. Maybe you should talk to the folks over there at Pocket Gamer. Make sure contacting the people who submit a gameapp for review with a advertising sales pitch is the best thing to do given the negative perception that goes with it.Cheers.,gamedev,d0qnod6,6,t5_2qi0a
6831762,0,t1_d0ql4hu,gt How do you think of a ball? ... You dont think of it as a series of functions composing with each other over multiple frames always creating a new ball every frame based on the input from last moments ball do you?No that is exactly how I think of a ball in my code. The ball is a simplified abstract model of a real ball. The ball is in my head. The code is me telling a machine to do stuff in a way that it simulates this model.

6856325,0,t3_49ofwa,Sounds like you need some brainstorming! I learned this technique from one of the professors at my schoolGet a pile of notecards or scraps of paper or really anything you can write on. Start with a central idea in this case it sounds like your central idea could be d RPG. Then for a few minutes have everyone on your team write down ideas that branch off of that central idea. Maybe D RPG makes you think of a roguelike which leads to dungeons darkness caves torches weapons armor anything that comes to mind. Write down each of these ideas on a separate notecard. Remember there are no bad ideas!Then after a few minutes or all the notecards have been used up take all the notecards and shuffle them into a pile. Give each team member  notecards. Now each person takes two notecards from their pile and comes up with two or three ideas for a game based on those two notecards.For example maybe your two notecards are Tree and Lava. You could design a simple platformer where the player is an ent and they have to make it to the end of each level without burning in lava. Or maybe you could make a strategy game where you have to defend the last tree on Earth from incoming waved of lava.After this phase is done each person writes their ideas on a board or piece of paper or something. Then team members take turns voting on their top  ideas. Look at the best ideas figure out which one you all like and which would be feasible to build in two weeks and boom! Now you have a game idea.,gamedev,d0th18w,3,t5_2qi0a

6876340,0,t3_49x1lw,Ive worked ten years in the industry now with many different engines everything from AAA to smaller productions plus making a dozen LudumdarePyweek sized hobby games.Ive played around with Unity a bit myself and earlier this year did a job where I optimized a mobile game that was written in Unity.I think Unity is fine for prototyping or shortterm hack projects. Personally I would not use it for anything serious. Here are the issues I noticed that I remember. We used Unity . then upgraded to . iirc. It crashed a lot. Sometimes it would lose the ability to start the game saying that there were compilation errors. Restarting Unity fixed it. Sometimes just restarting Unity didnt help. We had to quit it quit VS kill the process keeping the debugging connection or whatever alive. All of those things meant it was not uncommon for us to have to start Unity several times every hour. Unitys own UI system is shit. The performance is really bad and a large reason for that is that it encourages you to lay out your game objects in a way that is logically nice but means youll get a draw call for everything you want to draw.  Unity is a black box. This is a big problem for me personally but I think anyone who needs to try to optimize their game will think its tricky because even though the profiler is quite nice it can be really hard to figure out whats going on inside Unity thats making certain things take a lot of time. Unity felt slow and unresponsive just working with the editor. When deploying to mobile it had to deploy the whole game every time.  Loading a Unity game esp. on mobile takes a long time. For a platform where its important that the player can get into the game ASAP thats a killer.Thats what I remember off the top of my head. Me and my colleague were basically cursing at it daily. ,gamedev,d0vqw3u,40,t5_2qi0a

Only if youre doing a serious release.I mean were talking about a miniscule minority of users for a game presumably released in English on a site presumably in English.   Dvorak and Colmack users will be used to returning to QWERTY format all the time for gaming they will have some method worked out.   Arabic and Chinese will already have workarounds for this stuff because it would be necessary constantly if theyre poking around English gaming sites.   Japanese and Korean keyboards are regular QWERTY keyboards as far as I know but with the hiriganahangul overlaid.Probably the only ones worth accommodating are AZERTY and QWERTZ.  But simply avoiding the far left and far right keys for your bindings would be good enough to solve that unless you need to bind a lot of keys.In the end I dont think its a worthwhile expenditure of time unless youre doing a serious release for money.,gamedev,d14njgs,0,t5_2qi0a

Obviously you dont want to pass allocator object around everywhere as a parameter. So global access make sense here.But what makes singleton with virtual function useful is you can change behavior without having to recompile.In essence I can have an abstract allocator    class Allocator        virtual void alloc   virtual freevoid ptr            static void SetAllocatorAllocator allocator Allocator sAllocator  allocator          static Allocator GetAllocator return sAllocator          static Allocator sAllocator    Then I can have two implementation that derives from that. A FastAllocator or SlowMemoryTrackingDebugAllocator.And all you need is one executable and a start up flag and you can switch between using FastAllocator or SlowMemoryTrackingDebugAllocator easily without recompiling.This is actually a very common pattern during development.

All it says is you got a  minute call from a GP followed by an hourlong call to a cancer clinic and a hour call to some other number.  months later the other number calls a funeral home.Metadata puts you in the shoes of a police officer tasked with examining suspected connections to a recent criminal case. Connect numbers to names with a directory read peoples call logs and check their publicly viewable social media pages to piece together their lives and determine if theyre worth investigating.Im still in the early stages piecing together the UI to display all the information. Currently I have   A map to hold the numbers which leads into the call logs The social media site Emotr  no text emoji only!  The reason Im going with an emoji only social media site is to keep a focus on the main point of the game Metadata can paint a very clear picture with just a little bit of context. The other point of the game is to practice my writing skills and try to tell peoples stories in an elegant and meaningful way.  I expect to finish the game by the end of June and it will be my first commercial release. And by commercial I mean that someone can buy it  not that they necessarily will! Ill be releasing it on itch.io and hey if the quality is high enough and the reaction is positive enough I might be able to get in on Steam. That would be a wild time.

7067010,0,t1_d1hciqx,I realized as I was writing this reply Im not sure if youre interested in a general linear algebra reference material recommendation or more of a computer graphics math recommendation. My reply is all about general linear algebra but I dont think matrix decompositions or eigensolvers are used in realtime computer graphics but what do I know lol so probably just focusing on the transformations chapter in Mathematics for D Game Programming and Computer Graphics would be good. If it feels like youre just memorizing stuff I think thats normal but keep rereading the material and do examples by hand! If you really understand how projection matrices work then the transformations should make more sense and seem less like magic.I took Linear Algebra last semester and we used  I would highly recommend it. Along with that book I would recommend watching these video lectures  given by the author of the book. Ive never watched MITs video lectures until I watched these in preparation for an interview because I always thought they would be dumb but theyre actually really great! I will say that I used the pause button furiously because the lectures are very dense and I had to think about what he was saying!In my opinion the most important topics to focus on would be the definition of a vector space the four fundamental subspaces how the four fundamental subspaces relate to the fundamental theorem of linear algebra all the matrix decompositions in that book pivot variables and special solutions...I just realized Im basically listing all of the chapters in the book but I really do think they are all very important!

Source is not intended for d game development. Im not saying you should use Unity or Unreal to develop your game even though they support it they wont be putting  of their effort into developing the D part of their engine. If youve used Unity or Unreal before its OK though.. I was trying to say Donly engines like LoveD or libgdx internally use the D pipeline for rendering. I think the problem is that people misunderstood what you were saying S. So if you were saying not to use a full on d engine meant for d to make a d game thats fine.

We could have made our game with pixel art but we wanted to have D graphics to catch peoples attention  and it does work. However it means costs and time go way up for our small team so it was a stylistic choice not to use pixels first but it did have consequences for scope.People will often point to extremes  consoles are dead theres too much pixel art etc.  but you still see titles like Hyper Light Drifter and Stardew Valley making waves at least partially because the game and the style appeal to people. If pixel art enables you to make the game you want to make then I think its better to embrace that and make it your own.,gamedev,d1hk5sz,5,t5_2qi0a

I generally know what I want to do what I want the final result to be but I sometimes have no idea what the best course to achieve it is. Its like Ive got all these tools at my disposal variables conditions functions objects classes inheritance etc. but I dont know when to use them and when not to use them.For example Im building a game pretty simple and straightforward concept right now in Unity. Its now pretty advanced and actually playable. My problem is that huge parts of it are just stuff I saw reading  watching tutorial or took from threads on the Unity forums. I generally work at understanding what I just copied and then go Whoa thats clever. I would never have come up with that by myself.I realise this is probably something that comes with experience and that everyone takes inspiration from everyone anyway but I really feel like there are some dos and donts that I dont know about especially regarding object oriented programming.

We do  update every  weeks and we need to be certain that the same people will be there to support all the new content being added.

7195871,0,t3_4dzfz3,You could start getting experience by making mods for games!I learned programming and game development this way myself and highly recommend it. Personally I learned Java just to start making Minecraft mods but as more and more games start to support mods you should have a lot of choice in genre and programming language and very accessible modding environments.Advantages of modding over developing your own game Choosing a game you play a lot allows you to define a clear goal of something you would like to be able to do in this game. Because of this clear goal you will get to actually finish stuff. In my experience finishing a complete game is much more work than adding a single feature in the form of a mod. This is very important because knowing how to finish something small will eventually lead to being able to finish something huge. All aspects will come into play. Coding using code written by someone else artwork etc. Existing code base. You dont have to bother writing your own engine first because it already exists. Youll learn about all aspects to game development fast enough by simply using these systems and looking through the code. Existing community. Publishing mods through Steam has become very simple and accessible to everyone if the game supports it. Youll be able to get quite a lot of feedback from users.,gamedev,d1w40xa,2,t5_2qi0a

7203988,0,t3_4e4sqj,This is one of those things that requires both the technical tricks and a lot of art direction to get right. Here are a couple of thoughts This might be a cliche but I think using a subtle blue hue to your ambient andor directional moon light will go a long way to give it a night look. I think this way you can actually get away with a brighter scene that still looks like night. As you have already identified a lot of it has to do with getting good contrast in the scene and that means good light placement. Have a look at videos of the Planet Coaster night time including this one Lots of little lights that fall on multiple objects is quite convincing. Also note that the warm colors against the blueish background which goes back to my previous point. Also note that in that video they use a translucent cone mesh for lights. This gives you that additional contrast when there isnt anything for the light to shine on. Flickering lights like that of fire can also add to the scene since you generally wouldnt notice a light flickering in bright daylight. Im thinking increased specular highlights for the moonlight may help. Like tiny bright spots here and there in your scene.Very curious to see some before and after shots after this discussion ,gamedev,d1x1b0c,20,t5_2qi0a

7216877,0,t1_d1yfcyz,Marketing is a massive part of game development.  Many developers seem to just sweep it under the rug and not pay much attention to it. I make the argument that a game without players isnt really a game.  Its something else.  And to get players youre going to need to do marketing and become good at it. Handling data graphics vectors math.  That all seems to come naturally to us.  But marketing doesnt.  I have stopped developing my game to focus on marketing.  With so many indie developers out there its extremely hard now to get interest in your game.  Some of the best information Ive gotten has been from this subreddit.  And as someone else has said many developers market during development.  It gives you more opportunities to talk about your game and gain interest.  Doing it after your game is done only leaves you one opportunity to ask people to play your game. Personally I think marketing posts should stay.  But perhaps have a rule about not posting the same stuff.,gamedev,d1yi4c7,13,t5_2qi0a

7235879,0,t3_4ehzqc,Your trailer could use some work. It starts off with nothing happening for the first  seconds. That portion shouldnt be more than  seconds max.Even after the combat starts things are pretty haphazard. Your fist clip shows too many mechanics for the player to grasp what is going on. You have the players using an unusual kind of teleportattack to kill enemies multiple enemy types one of the players dying and being revived by the other player... its too much.Overwhelming the audience with more information than they can absorb isnt necessarily a bad thing but it should come at the end of the trailer not the start.My rough script for your trailerThe two player spacecraft just flying around similar to what you have now but after a couple of seconds they start using their teleportattack move around the place. This clip should play for less than  seconds preferably about .Your first combat clip should probably just show the players using their teleportattack on some sort of basic enemy with neither player dying. Cut to a clip of combat against more enemy types. Cut to another clip of combat where one player dies but is revived by the other player. Cut to another clip where enemies and bullets are flying everywhere. Cut to another combat clip that is even more hectic. Cut to killing the final enemy of a level like what you have at the en of your current trailer. Transition to game title. End.,gamedev,d20o0uq,3,t5_2qi0a

An actor is anything that interacts with the environment dynamically for example the ball in rocket league or an AINPC in an MMO.  The amount of CPU and network throughput you need goes up exponentially as you increase the number of actors.  This was one of the driving factors behind the decision to reduce the maximum raid size in World of Warcraft from  players to  especially after the disastrous lag problems in some of the NPC heavy fights in raids like BWL.,gamedev,d26dvnu,-1,t5_2qi0a

7299594,0,t3_4fd8s0,You arent sure if its possible but you want to do it? Anyway based on that video I dont see why it wouldnt be possible. It looks like its an intermediate network layer that assigns players to game servers based on in packet information about the players location within the game. There are already solutions to load balance client applications in the network this just goes one step further and does the distribution based on ingame information. If Im right about what this is doing there would be some confusion from the players perspective with respect to instancing players popping in and out? where do you find your friends? although with back end communication you could address that in different ways as well. Alternately instead of instancing you could make it a single massive game server type of game. If you were using it as a one massive world then you would have to do some clever stuff in the back end to maintain communication between all nodes about what all the clients are doing this would in turn mean that you lose a lot of scaling that this model implies. It doesnt matter if you have  servers each only doing  clients each its not going to scale because you still have each server handling a million game objects so all the clients can see each other. It helps but there are limits. ,gamedev,d27wx7j,1,t5_2qi0a

7344365,0,t1_d2cucek,We almost have to keep the price page vague at this point because there are a number of factors that complicate it. The main reason is that the backend costs can vary by huge amounts. A game with k users and a handful of registered events is going to be negligible compared to a game with k users and dozens of registered events. As we get experience with different customers we plan on hashing out a more well defined tiered structure we just dont want to commit to anything too early.The second reason why it is intentionally left vague is that we want to be flexible with any early adopters specifically to be able to offer significant discounts from what we would nominally like to charge.

7345478,0,t3_4fyf6g,I have personally never used libGDX but I have released a game to the app store using gamemaker. Gamemaker is really only useful for prototyping rapidly. If you ever wish to release a game the drag and drop interface doesnt provide nearly as much functionality as you will need. I often found myself writing code to perform actions that were already built into the engine because you didnt have enough control over the built in actions. Also making menus is time consuming and for me the roomobject system became a lot to handle.

7439350,0,t3_4h4xx7,Hey thanks! Ive been following your recent blog posts because Im planning similar features for character customisation in the project Im working on and have had similar questions. Im still learning programming so its great to see how an experienced coder approaches things.I do have lots of game dev character and animation experience so now your questions are getting into my realm.Unless youre swapping parts from arms to legs etc. weights shouldnt be a problem. You can just assign those when you create the objects. Youll know what bones are being used. If you are swapping parts then youll need something but I wouldnt go full procedural. Id look at weighting the bones in the object and having a generic joint weight for the socket which you can assign to the receiving bone.For animation humanoid already has animation retargeting so the hard part is taken care of. If youre creating your own animations you can go with generic which I think may be slightly easier in the long run but I need to investigate more. There are two issues here. One is that for humanoid after any adjustment of the skeleton you need to redo the mapping. The other is that humanoid has issues with bones in between mapped bones which can be a pain. If youre creating your own anims you wont need humanoids method of retargeting.So now you just need to figure out how to map your parts to your anims. You can do that with a combination of ik and spring joints. Create a bipedal skeleton to map the animation onto and link your new limb to the bipedal skeleton using ik. For tips of longer tentacles or for shorter tentacles you can use spring joints.Rather than doing it all procedurally You can also create custom anims for some of those limbs or joints which may help sell it.,gamedev,d2nt12s,1,t5_2qi0a

7460911,0,t3_4hk400,I often feel the same way. I love programming but I know Im not very good at it. It really just comes down to doing it though. The longer you do it the better you get. I learn something new every single day Im working on my projects at home and at work. You have to push yourself to learn new things and you will improve. Nobody comes out of school and knows exactly how to make any program that they want so dont feel like you should be have to.Dont get discouraged just start really small and then keep trying bigger and bigger projects. If you start small its easier to keep going because youll see a bunch of tiny accomplishments along the way. If you start really big and expect to know exactly how to do everything you will only disappoint yourself and feel inadequate.

7474183,0,t3_4hr8vf,It really depends on the type of art you need the quality the quantity you want. The cost will largely vary depending on how seasoned the artist is whether they have worked on big name projects etc. Also are you looking for someone to concept your ideas or turn existing ideas into pixel art? Artists generally charge an hourly rate and can range from hr to hr depending on experience and how well known they are in the industry. There are also artists that charge per piece. We are a triple A game dev studio and currently outsourcing weapon concepts for  a piece. Generally we start with sending an NDA then a contract then monthly statement of works if you continue to use the same artist. Pixeljoint.com is a great website to comb through for a potential pixel artist for your game! Best of luck!,gamedev,d2rrqu5,4,t5_2qi0a

Maybe there could be traps that force the player to move in a skillful way or buttons that open doors maybe a button spawns a bunch of enemies in your path to the door and you have to fight your way back to it.  Perhaps some kind of barrier that protects enemies that you must deactivate.  The way I make games is to make a big toolbox of mechanics that can interact in various ways so I have a lot of creative options when designing levels.  Giving each level or area a theme whether with regards to enemies or puzzle types or structure can also help direct the design.Of course this might not be the sort of game you were envisioning or the kind of advice you were asking for but I thought Id chip in.,gamedev,d3h9b81,1,t5_2qi0a

7706450,0,t1_d3huobo,Weve been through the same spiel a lot before on rgamedev but I can say this. We are using legitimate marketing tactics and everything we do is based on trial and error. Weve rebranded a lot of what we do for example the accounts we now post a lot on on Twitter are branded explicitly as promoshoutout accounts for people to follow and make sure we are using legitimate marketing techniques to back up what we do. We have a huge focus on research and education and our blog is one of the biggest and most read of any publishers blog out there. Publishers like Ultrashock and OtakuMaker are absolute crap and their rate card image is literally a direct but shittier looking rip of one of our graphics that we had custom designed. OtakuMaker has also ripped off our promo materials and our words almost literally in the past.We are also very up frontwe dont do anything you could not do on your own. We serve as a signal boost and a timesaver for you. Instead of taking the time to collect journalists emails and analyze what genres of game they all like so you can target your efforts just come to us and we can save you the hassle.I also personally never hesitate to send people to our competitors on paper were good friends with all of them like NovyPR and Evolve PR who are excellent people.Sure some would equate Black Shell Media to a company like Ultrashock because a lot of people hate us blindly but we have gotten a lot of our games a ton of success and weve given small devs opportunities that they would have had to either wait ages for or could not have gotten themselves.Im actually talking to Ryan uvideogameattorney and helping him get hands on some of our case studies which I will also share publicly if I can get clearance from our legal team and our developers.We dont have bad intentions.

7743607,0,t3_4l8nas,This is a super good question but heres my two cents from having worked with both.You should use whatever youre the most comfortable with.The only thing you really lose over using Monogame instead of SDL is control. If you dont trust Monogames spritebatch system optimized enough or you need to do some OpenGL post processing stuff I think youll find it better to stick with SDL. Otherwise if you dont mind handing over some control to the framework then Monogame is quite nice to use.gt  rendering text doesnt seem very intuitive it took me a week to get Freetype and OpenGL to play nicely together and even now Im doing it very poorly texture swap per charactergt  drawing sprites without spritesheets seems inefficient yet building a pipeline to manage sprites and build them together into a spritesheet and build a library to handle that easily seems like a lot of workWhat I did when I was messing with SDL was I used SDLSurfaces to create pixel maps to then shove onto openGL textures as a kind of spritebatch system which is what monogame has out the gate. This way I could use things like SDLTTF or SDLImage which only output to surfaces if memory serves. SDLSurfaces work really well if youre doing pixel manipulation and arent using them to blit to the screen instead loading them into a texture for a shader to load. gt  animations and simple adhoc drawingIf youre interested I can dig up some of my old engine thats actually just on my GitHub and pixel manipulation code. At some point I even cobbled together a shape rendering library. Once you have a basic sprite batching system and a decent sprite renderer animations are no more or less complicated in Monogame from SDL in my experience at least.,gamedev,d3me48t,2,t5_2qi0a

7885821,0,t1_d42etrr,gt  by Its about this Im not sure about the exact numbers right now. gt Regarding the postprocessing effects do you do that after scaling to make it look better or did you mean that its less performance intensive to apply it to the smaller internal buffer and then scale it up?It depends on the effect. Doing it on the smaller buffer is faster but doing it on the final presentation is sharper bigger resolution. If you need the effect to be really sharp e.g. the curvature we have in NV Id suggest doing this on the final rendering but if its about color adjustments its way faster to do it on the smaller target.gt OR did you mean that RenderTargetD is able to do all those things?Render targets basically mean rendering into a texture which you can then render at any scale you want and rendering this texture is often the good opportunity to sneak a fullscreen shader.gt What do you think about storing rooms in a PNG?It can definitely be a solution and I believe it would use less memory than parsing plain textxml. Its a good workaround when you dont have a map editor you can simply design map in Paint!.

So have instances with only a few players interacting. You could also have Massively Multiplayer but not have it online  so simulate LAN gaming or have actual offline LAN gaming with uploads of results and gameplay streams. You seem to mean MMO as MMORPG.I am implementing a persistent MMORPG with  locations. Procedurally Generated of course.

7946913,0,t3_4o2j0n,Its definitely something you can learn.  Whether you want to is kind of up to you.  Ive been alternating between making models and coding for various personal game projects for about a year now.  Its definitely handy to be able to make my own models even if theyre not quite professional quality since it means that if I need a thing I can just go make it and be assured that itll match the style of everything else Ive made.  Means Im not constrained by what assets I can find online.  So if I decide to make my enemies use a handheld sonic cannon like an LRAD  something thats not very likely to be in an asset pack I still have the autonomy to put that in my game without contracting out the work.  This becomes even more beneficial for animations which are usually even more gamespecific.It comes at a cost though.  You cant just become awesome or even mediocre at D modeling overnight.  Any time you spend learning D or actually making the models or texturing or animating D is a multidisciplinary effort is time not spent on coding the game itself.  It can be enjoyable though.  Personally as a full time nongame developer I actually find it rather refreshing to do something creative thats not code  and seeing my creations running around ingame is super satisfying.  I dont think Id stay nearly as motivated if I was just looking at a bunch of cubes with the graphics all handwaved until some unforseen when I can get an artist to do it point.  But Ive also never really finished a game for all the time Ive spent on it.  So theres a definite tradeoff there.,gamedev,d49b37c,3,t5_2qi0a

7983506,0,t3_4okbuq,Well as unanocinder said  Autodesk Maya is a great place to start with d modelling. Its free for students too. Photoshop GIMP Paint.Net are a few to get you started on pixel art or textures. Terms you will want to google around are bones and skinning. Those will relate to how your model animates and how textures movestretch with the model. General advice  pick a scale in advance.  unit  m  units  m doesnt matter. Just pick it in advance and stick to it. Itll make your life so much easier when it comes to composing a scene or combining models. Have some idea of your part grouping. If your model has a good structure when you make it it will be easier to animate. Work from sources too general art thing  your results will be better with a reference.You can use unity to put together some easy d rendering and animation and view your results. ,gamedev,d4df6p2,1,t5_2qi0a

Say for example gravity is acting on a block that is moving upwards as its velocity upwards decreases it will be moving up slower so you would need to account for that in the animation perhaps a progress variable or something ranging from  that would set the animation to that point?

8061566,0,t1_d4m5i6g,I believe what theyre trying to say is that your game just doesnt look very appealing.  To be brutally honest it looks rather ugly. And while a lot of people know that gameplay and visuals are two different things and that ugly games can still be fun being visually appealing is still a very important part of making a successful game.    Personally I am put off by terrible visuals even though I know fun games dont necessarily have to look pretty.   I think the main thing thats wrong about your art style is that its incredibly inconsistent. There are elements in pixel art other elements look more vectorarty and theres those pseudoD thingies the players stand on.    Generally its a bad idea to mix pixel art with nonpixel art I dont think Ive ever seen a game where that looked good.      The audience around the stadium in your screenshots looks like its just two or three ugly assets copy pasted over and over again the audience looks more like glitch art because its almost impossible to make out the individual characters.  In addition youre using a LOT of different colors few of which actually fit together. I get that youre working with the countries colors but even so theres a lot of additional color that doesnt fit in.     Sorry if Im being brutal here but since you asked for feedbackideas on what went wrong thats my two cents.    ,gamedev,d4m71rd,9,t5_2qi0a

8099627,0,t3_4q5587,Any sort of game that involves things happening instantly from client input need to employ client side prediction. If your client is completely dumb and only sends inputs there will be a bad lag especially for people with slow connections and people will think your game is slow. What happens when your server receives an incorrect client state is largely a manner of your game mechanics. In most cases the server will notify the client to change its state to the correct one. On the client this usually involves some rewinding or interpolating of the current state to the correct one. You can see examples of this happening in many games when someone has bad ping.For something as big as an MMO you need to design your architecture from the beginning to be able to scale horizontally. This means you can have multiple servers processing for your game. When you need to scale you simply spin up another server. You may even require separate servers for different systems within your game. This gets more fun if your servers are operating on the same state in real time.Id recommend checking out two sites both people have great things to say about this subject,gamedev,d4qgyqk,3,t5_2qi0a

8174041,0,t1_d4z865t,Sorry I meant to all other points in the map. So if you have x on each floor thatd be  points for that floor and if you had  floors thatd be around  points total. Thats not too big as an array of  bytes or shorts is ltk.If the target is right above the ai manhattan would say its only  apart which is not a great estimate. With the landmark it may be a bit better although its somewhat map dependent.This paper is a bit beyond me at the moment but from what I understand they propose flattening out the map so that the regular manhattan distance works better as a heuristic. Applied to your maps if the stairselevators are near the edges of the levels you could rotateshift the levels so that instead of being right above each other theyre adjacent. Side view ascii art change           ||    to                       in the heuristic function change level s coordinates by shifting them over a bit so that the target is right above the ai problem produces a larger distance for the heuristic. I dont know how practical this is as I havent tried it myself.You wouldnt change the actual map  just somehow change the coordinates given to the manhattan distance function so that its distances more closely match the real walking distance. If you can do this it might be easier than implementing the landmarkdifferential heuristic stuff.,gamedev,d4zazfs,1,t5_2qi0a

It also harks back to a time when typists pools were a thing. Team rooms dont have to be dedicated to a specific team and when reorgs happen you can switch up where people are working.

8215908,0,t1_d54gsc2,Yes you should use an axle for that. Here is a quick gif that shows how the things are done that you didnt understandSo you use two different layers one for the wheels one for the chassis and connect them via an axle that can then be configured to be a motor. Certainly more complicated than to drag together readymade blocks but I feel it allows for more stuff to be done. I kind of hope that with a better explanation it wont seem as hard to understand.The spickywheels are made by putting together a big polygon with small triangles as spikes.From looking at the gif does it become more clear what you need to do? My plan is to make a gifbased tutorial that goes through this a little slower step by step with s gifs in loops that show every step.

8236082,0,t1_d56xzk2,Its a testament of how great marketing the Unity team is doing. They sell hammers after all. Unity has become Visual Basic of game development. Back in the day Visual Basic was a goto tool for beginners to build Windows GUI applications in WYSIWYG style. Many serious programmers using C Java or whatever was popular back then would laugh at those and really feel awful if a VB application became popular. Using Visual Basic was a tell that you were a beginner and most probably you lack skills to make a well engineered product.I have to admit I made my first programs in VB. They did their job. Once I discovered Borland C Builder with Delphi VCL stuff I ditched VB and never looked back.

8280476,0,t3_4suadz,gtyou can play and release videos after some embargo date which is earlier than the public releaseSo heres the perspective from marketing Streamers are great for impulse sales and games that are well on their way to success.  A good reason to embargo videos until your game is for sale is so people can watch the video and then buy it or you agree with the streamer to plug your Greenlight page to vote before it becomes a distant memory.If a streamer has a very successful playthrough with a huge audience and your game isnt available to buy yet then its hard not to think youve missed out on an opportunity.Also if the streamer ends up dumping on the game or generally having a bad time you can shoot yourself in the foot before the game even comes out.So its a judgement call with some risks if you want to let streamers stream your game before release.  As usual it circles back to depth and quality  a deep good game wont be hurt by prerelease streaming because there will be plenty of opportunity after release.,gamedev,d5cm9yu,5,t5_2qi0a

I dont mean to be harsh but you obviously havent been out on your own having to find a job and make ends meet yet and theres a couple things you need to considerampnbsp Game development is an extremely difficult field to get into compared to general IT or software development.  Even if its possible to get a job without an education not having one extremely limits your options where you can live and the types of positions you can target.  It would be extremely foolish to forgo an education with the intent of making games.ampnbsp Unless you have the talent desire dedication and time to dedicate to developing a SOLID portfolio of successfully published games as an indie developer  youre not going to get considered for jobs at established studios without a bachelors degree.  Every single position you can find pretty much says bachelors degree or equivalent experience where experience means work experience on shipped titles from established studios.ampnbsp Now Im not saying that you shouldnt learn on your own...you absolutely SHOULD.

For at least  if not  years that has been considred unacceptable in . of cases. The cost of putting really good artwork in is so low that every single studio has been putting AAAAA artwork into their throwawaydemos.The demo you need right now is formally called a vertical slice you can google that term to read  years of articles books tutorials blog posts about them.The ideal would be something that only has a few working parts specifically the bits you want to include as clips in your promo video which should be no more than  seconds long.To generate  seconds of footage most people make  minutes of polished gameplay so you can make choices about camera angle etc. But if youre really clever about it and design your video up front you could get away with only a few minutes of heavily scripted gameplay.That would be enough to move you forward in most ways right now  get Greenlit get preorders start making sales etc.But better would be a Vertical Slice with a full endtoend  minutes of playtime. Thats what you want players to download.The most interesting fragment of the most interesting level letting people play it long enough to get good at it and become hooked and want more. ... but no more than that.,gamedev,d5wekw7,9,t5_2qi0a

You still need some manner of design about what the assets lookfeel like and consider their affordances for a final project. Otherwise you end up with a game that feels bad even if it is technically proficient on the programming side and beautiful on the art side and then people call it an asset flip.Further if you are one person you still need a bit of talent as just buying assets to replace your programmer art at random will result in a mess of a final game.,gamedev,d5z9sjw,8,t5_2qi0a

Salary was consistently  higher than the best I could earn for same skillset in game dev. That worked out as ... a lot.Its symptomatic of the Gambling industrys vast wealth and its need for legitimacy and disguise.But gambling is the dark side of humans love of games. Most of us who work in the games industry especially on the design side look at gambling and feel its using our skills for badharm. Where we gain expertise in giving people a riskplayreward cycle and celebrate our ability to make addictive experiences we dont really mean true addiction. We dont want harmful outcomes  we actively want to stop short of any player getting too deep into our games.Once you go into the gambling industry you cross a line. I make no judgement on the people whove done that but as a designer your responsibility for your actions becomes a much darker tradeoff.TLDR most game designers Ive worked with have had seductive offers from the gambling industry.

8496100,0,t1_d63ij9x,Hey thanks for the answer! Itll be an online D game with a few dozen people on at once. We actually did have server authoritative movement initially but changed it after reading some articles and posts about best practices as well as complaints from testers. People were complaining about having to wait for the server to send back responses on when to move stop when to attack and just made things frustrating. The idea was youd set pos and direction when moving then when player stops send stop. This worked well if you had low latency but for everyone else they didnt like it.Once we switched it our overseas testers seemed to like it better being able to control freely without the added latency even though they may not be  in sync at every moment. It was also extra work for the server to be doing the movement simulation when the clients were already handling it just adding to the load for no reason.  Unfortunately Im not sure if there is a compromise in there somewhere but those are some of the reasons why I settled on this method.,gamedev,d63kawq,1,t5_2qi0a

Or if weekend karaoke singers started posting their covers in a music forum. This would drown the legit submissions people would stop comingI know it seems harsh to compare games with stickdrawings but some indie games are that bad.gt By what method would players know about a game then?I dont know. Buy advertising. Send your game to reviewers. Get a publisher that know what theyre doing. Make interesting and engaging videos featuring the game. Make engaging blog posts that are more than advertising. Make your game groundbreaking instead of boring so people will report on how revolutionary it is.If you want to post to rgamedev make posts that are relevant to us. Any advertisement is not relevant.gt And finally on what world do you live on where you think that D games are looked down upon? Plenty of D and even .D games are some of the highest rated on the planet. These games are not simply gimmicky nor are they bad games. And neither is ours.I think youre misconstruing his argument. He said run of the mill D platformer. The keyword here is run off the mill not D. By no means all D games are bad or gimicky but your game seems to be.gt If someone were to release a bad game once should they ALWAYS be judged on that merit? Again youre misconstruing his argument. No. Each game should be judged by itself. Ideally bad games should not see any revenue. We want better games. Why reward bad ones?And Jazz Jackrabbit is a good game. Better than  of plataformers released today thats why people still remember it.By the tone of your blog posts and your replies here you seem to believe that every indie dev deserve money and recognition just because you put the hours. Sorry but thats not enough.EDIT I just looked on your post history to find your game and I found this piece of advicegt To stand any chance of making it without a mass quantity of marketing thrown at the title make a good game grow your social media presence try your best to stand out from the crowd and hope for a little luck and kindness.Maybe you should follow it?Also this post gt Have you considered that your game is part of the shovelware?,gamedev,d64jq4c,1,t5_2qi0a

The game has been featured on AppGratis and also Mobango and my team and I are also in talks to get a pitch going to get featured on Play Store  App Store. Its not easy to get featured theres often a lot of work and bullshit you need to go through but its been worth it. Maybe ads are effective if youve got the money I definitely dont but what definitely seems to work is getting the game reviewed or featured as much as possible.

8508541,0,t3_4w4xmz,Well the true is Your game sucksis bad is the most you will get. It is your job to make a good game so until i will get a good pay you are on your own. The best thing to do is to make a game that you would buy yourself for  anything less is like spam. Do a super polished game that you like to play do not try to be ass kisser. Games are not food they are made for fun so a high level of quality is expected we dont care if you cannot make a high quality game just find another job then. This is the result of spam like games mobile shops are hurting from this. Dont do bad games try to target AAA game level that way you will lower amount of games you make and you will raise the overall quality of gaming industry. Making your game visible is important but i would like for you to spend most of your resourses on making a good game. Even AAA games scene is hurting very much from this because games come out buggy boring not fully implemented missing some stuff and so on. So if you want the word to spread make sure your game is super good. If it will be bad then your game will drown in spam and no one will want to play it. Well you should really improve your games quality if you want to be noticed because now when i hear that game was made by indie devs i just loose my interest in it and in general i just sort games by price and look at over  not that these games are all good but that filters most of spam.,gamedev,d654fwm,1,t5_2qi0a

8511522,0,t1_d65fe0y,UHC was special because the people playing were kind of curated though unless they have public servers now. The amount of strategy that went into that was partially because they were doing a youtube series. Also the games lasted a few hoursif you get players to be committed that long you can be sure that theyre somewhat committed to staying alive and strategizing what you want! but the game length definitely turns some people away.Games like Rust and DayZ have this problem as well you can spend days potentially weeks setting up a basegathering weapons and lose it all in one raid. You burn out quickly.Overall I think you need to do a lot of playtesting with a game like this so that people feel like they could be backstabbed at any moment but make games shortrelaxing enough so that players dont burn out when they die.,gamedev,d65hwrx,3,t5_2qi0a

When the button is pressed you loop through the vector and send a command object to each entity.If you want to keep your entities flat using composition instead of inheritance you could make certain components interact with buttons in their own special ways in two steps  button tells all entities it controls using something like a command pattern object  entity forwards button message to its constituent components.

Having the basics while it may be  of the game is only a very small part of a completed product.

Its got a bunch of different phases of civilization and lots of different subsystems that come in and out of play as time progresses? Its huge and overwhelming and will take you forever to make? Make a standalone game that just takes a tiny subsection of your grand design and prototypes it. Make a game thats nothing but your military system or if thats already bigscope nothing but your battle system and see how fun you can make ituse it to get a better understanding of the creative challenges associated with that type of subsystem. Once youre happy with one of these prototypes move onto the next.As you do this youll build up a pretty good library of tools for making these types of games so once youre ready to sew them all together into your dream project itll go way way way faster than just taking on your dream project directly would and youll have way more perspectivehope of doing it justice due to all the focused experience youve accumulated.,gamedev,d6twwkf,1,t5_2qi0a

8739937,0,t3_4znypq,I dont know if any of these would fix any of the particular issues yall are talking about here but heres a few ideas Ive had to spice up space strategy games. Planetary Rotation in solar systems have planets rotate around the sun over the course of their respective years. This would add the strategic level of timing attackslandingsetc. for optimum planetary positions. Kind of like Seasons in games like the Total War game except mostly geometrybased. Additionally planets should have moons as many as  or  even which should in turn rotate around their planets. And maybe even orbital satellites that actively orbit the planet. This combined with the ability to colonize and build stuff on the moons would add a layer of depth to planetary invasions that you dont usually see orbital defense platforms moon bases etc. would only have an effect on the side of the planet theyre currently on so a welltimed attack could possibly bypass them but if the attack is too slow the stations come back around and crush the invading force!. Things like that. This would work really well alongside my second idea. An entire game set inside a single solar system. This is just something Id like to see explored more in all scifi mediums be they video game cinema literature or whatever else. But if my first idea Planetary Rotation is used as well it would become a really interesting unprecedented to my knowledge at least strategy game. I think Kerball does something like this but its not a strategy game in the sense were talking and Ive never played it so I cant really speak for it. One way a singlesystem game could be structured would be like the original Rome Total War campaign play as one of several outlying colonies and try to gain power until youre strong enough to take over the massively powerful Earth faction.. If a singlesystem game doesnt interest you at the very least I think solar systems should be bigger and more interesting. In most space strategy games Ive played systems are almost like the equivalent of a single city in a landbased X. And to me thats a shame. Systems are where the bulk of the action happens why then do we make them so small and undetailed? I think they should be less like cities and more like continents capable of supporting several viable colonies from several different empires even. Every object in the system should mean something. No more or at least very few useless Class  Uninhabitable planets with no worth to anyone except as something to break up the empty space. Even uninhabitable planets should have something on them worth visiting them for like special minerals that are extremely dangerous to mine but very rewarding if obtained adding riskreward choices.. While were continuing to focus smaller and smaller lets give planets a complete makeover as well. I dont mind the tilebased interface most games seem to use these days but lets make planets feel unique again. Make geography matter in ways besides the ubiquitous this tile is open for buildingthis tile is unusablethis tile give bonus XXXthis tile can be terraformedetc. Also why do we have to insist that planets can only be controlled by a single empire? Planets are BIG. Look at the planet we live on theres like  countries here and even if youre only considering international superpowers theres still plenty of those. Think back to European colonization of both the Americas and Africa. Did the Spanish French and all give up just because the English established Jamestown? Hell no. Why should our spacefaring empires many of which dont give a flying youknowwhat about diplomacy have to give up on that beautiful Paradise planet just because someone else got there  turns earlier? In following with that I also suggest an update to. Planetary combat. Now Im not suggesting we need to implement Empire At Wartype land battles into our space Xs. Far from it I do love EAW though. I do however think there needs to be more to planetary war than just you have  troops defending Im invading with  I win. At least have the ability to invadedefend specific sectors of a planet. Maybe also a couple different classes of planetary units infantry armor air artillery. Orbital superiority could have significant effects here remember the orbiting defense stations I mentioned in my first point? If you decided to rush by rather than destroying them youd better be prepared when they come back around or your promising invasion could go the way of Blockbuster.So in summary I think we need to stop thinking about how to make things bigger and more of an intergalactic spectacle and start thinking about how to make the small systems and planets more interesting.I would love to make this game myself but its a little out of my personal scope and Im already in the middle of a promising project anyway. Anyone looking for ideas by all means feel free to take mine.,gamedev,d6y55g0,1,t5_2qi0a

8768060,0,t1_d71gu4l,you misread him. The point system isnt about limiting  points of damage its about ratelimiting attacks while giving allowances for multiple types of attacks. The points he refers to is independent from damage and totally hidden from players.for example you could say that enemies are allotted  points for every  seconds. A large attack may cost  points by itself and do  of the players hp while a small attack may only cost  and only do . Or whatever you want your numbers to be. Its like using an AP system you find in many games except your distributing the total available AP amongst multiple enemies. If you wanted you could have it so each additional enemy contributes to the groups total AP. Its also obviously not a onestop solution. Its simply to provide another lever for balance adjustment the reason why I and several other people really like the idea is because its so simple in principal stupid simple to implementsimplicity trumps complexity nine times out of ten when it comes to code but theres still a LOT you can do with it. ,gamedev,d71o69n,2,t5_2qi0a

It has a lower barrier to entry for prototyping and lets you implement and practice game design.Also if you like writing and storytelling maybe write a book? Or some short stories?I guess what Im saying is its good to learn coding and art but it will take you quite some time and a lot of persistence before you can produce the things you are imagining.

Im amazed this works at all!Youre running everything single threaded right? I guarantee you if you start using heavily multihreaded code this will instantly blow up this was the point for me where I stopped doing anything inside exception handlers.If anyone is interested in a how production crash handling is done I could write a blog post about it.

8848469,0,t3_51e9qv,Ill be tuning in here as I think a lot of the same things apply to Lets PlayYouTube content creation.Some assorted things that work well for me Give yourself a short break with a scheduled end time. This can be either helpful or dangerous. Sometimes a little distance makes your heart grow fonder and youre ready to dive back in after. Other times it feels a little too much like falling off the horse.  Its easy to get overwhelmed with all the things you have to do. Break it down. Put down your  year roadmap and look at just the one next activity that needs doing. Sometimes the appetite comes with the eating as it were. If your one next task would take longer than  minutes you probably need to break it down further. Its so easy to expect too much from yourself. When you sit down to work make a list on a post it of  things you want to accomplish that session. If you get the first done CELEBRATE! Make your list things that are highimpact and important not just the urgent or easy. Dress for success! This one is a little silly but it really truly does work Dress up fancy for your work time. If you feel like a schlub or a lump on a log you may well act that way. Take a shower shave do your hair up nice and throw on a nice shirt and slacks or even a blazer.  Plan little breaks and rewards for yourself. Tell yourself that youll work for  minutes and then go for a  minute walk around the block to get fresh air. Set out a chocolate piece and eat it only after youve done x  minute sessions or something like that. Id also highly recommend practicing Chasing that happy as a reward D Highfiving the universe is a very effective technique. As an effective mindfullness technique observe but dont judge your resistance. When you feel the resistance bubble to the surface while youre working stop what youre doing and just breathe. Just notice the resistance and acknowledge its presence. Welcome it into the living room of your conscience Hello resistance old friend. Its good to see you again. This sounds cheesy but it is surprisingly effective. Be gentile with yourself. Its so easy to beat yourself to a pulp about all the things you should be doing but arent. Just cut yourself some slack. Ups downs feasts and famines are normal and literally not possible to avoid. Respond to yourself and comfort yourself as you would a child whether a child of yours you when you were a kid a niecenephew etc. ,gamedev,d7bgku2,5,t5_2qi0a

8855818,0,t3_51hird,You may want to go paper prototype here get yourself some dice a bag full of armymen and draw out a map use legos whatever. much faster than sinking more dev time into an idea when you have questions that need answering if your mechanics need to change you want to know now rather than after youve already implemented them.Remember that the AI exists to give the player interesting problems to solve and the fun is in using the available tools in different ways to solve the problem. You can test that without having an AI using what your AI will have available set up those interesting problems and then work through them as the player. You want to know if using the tools to solve the problem is fun.some problems to solve might be.. scouting how fun are the turns before contact? Are the tools the player has for gathering intelligence fun to use? What about when the player is ambushed and surrounded? How fun is being on the defensive? Is it challenging?After the main problem is set up the AI has already made the important decisions in a battle and just reacts to the player according to a pretty simple set of rules plus their enemy design. For instance a rule might be that every AI should notice if they are in an exposed position. If so they will react based on what they are. A beserker might charge the player Another type will seek cover another will drop a smoke screen or whatever. The point is you can establish this beforehand and it doesnt take a supercomputer to figure it out.After youve worked through a few problems yourself swap roles and have somebody else play through the situations youve designed while you use the logic your AI would use to play the other side. Its important to have different kinds of people try your game as they may come up with ways to break it that you havent thought of.,gamedev,d7cce9j,3,t5_2qi0a

8871241,0,t1_d7e60rw,No. I work for a contractor we make games for bigger companies most of them casual and for marketing purposes. After years we finally got our companys support and we spinnedoff to start a pure game development studio.Big AAA studio vs. smaller indie is similar to big company vs. small company.I think if you can working on a AAA studio for a while will give you a great deal of experience the tools of the trade industry contacts etc. Its something you wont get anywhere else. The counterpart is like you said pressure crunch time limited freedom in terms of decisions etc.Currently more and more you start seeing AAA vets and not so vets to move towards indie gaming because of those reasons.You can even create games yourself instead of working for an indie company. More freedom much harder.Nothing beats having the experience of all sides of the counter but of course that takes real life time I believe all game devs love what they do and are passionate about making and playing games and thats what matters and what makes games great.Even if you dont know what you love exactly now as long as you are selfaware life will lead you.Ive spend over a decade making game for others and felt now the need to make a game I want to make so I took the leap of faith.

Key things that may not be obvious that you would need to do to make it work there may be more this is what I thought of so far Use linear texture filter render game at a lower resolution dont use physx for your movement mechanics. Another thing you can do is render game to texture that is taller than screen. Then for look updown move that texture up and down instead of rotating camera. Theres also the obvious of using sprites for everything instead of d models. these things should get you pretty close to what the games looked and felt like.

If your only motivation is some imaginary payday then it will run out when that nasty bug solve goes on for too many hours.   If however chasing that bug down and solving it gave you a sense of accomplishment that is actually a nice little boost.   I feel like getting a fireball thrown your way either a concrete goal for a game or even a programming mission from a friend or client would be a good way to focus your mind externally.   I dont know how much cash youll make and frankly it doesnt matter just now.   Youre on disability  so take the chance on making a game.   Make some incredibly laughably simple game that only takes an afternoon pong . hell I dont know and see if that makes you feel good.   If it does do it some more.

8936273,0,t3_52nx4e,It depends on where you go but a gameplay programmer might actually use C like Unity does. JavaScript and Lua would be others.A graphics programmer absolutely needs to know OpenGL at a minimum. DirectX is a bonus. I would only learn it as far as being able to say youve had exposure to it in an interview until you know if you need to specialize in it.Learning to write shaders or gameplay code will make you useful fast. The problem with leaning OpenGL in depth is that it pretty much requires you mastering engine architecture at the same time. If thats your cup of tea great! I love studying data structures design patterns and writing boiler plate code so its been highly rewarding for me. But it also takes years to master. If you want a job sooner rather than later look for something that will make you useful quicker while learning the hard stuff at a different pace. ,gamedev,d7m0aps,3,t5_2qi0a

8950096,0,t1_d7nmudv,Thank you it is always a pleasure! Retention is a very sensitive metrics. Almost anything can change it easily.  The main point here is that retention reflects the level of users loyalty and loyalty in its turn indicates the way your users understand the game if they are extremely into it whether they enjoy game play in general. Another point here is that day retention is considered to be the most important one. The better you got across the game idea the higher retention gets. Thats why optimization of the first time user experience must be polished.  In devtodev system we pay special attention to the Tutorial steps report where you can build up a funnel with more than  steps made during the first session then pinch point and remove the bottlenecks.  To improve   day retention you need to upgrade the core loop itself to make sure that users are engaged and set the goals that make them come back. In addition retention depends a lot on traffic quality and here the best solution to optimize it first. Just to make sure that my answer is complete here is the link to webinar Handle users carefully that I hosted recently. Focus on your project first!

Im also not very big on sharing things publicly myself. However I do follow many public personalities from different fields game devs authors actors and so Im basing this on behavior Ive seen and liked or disliked.Some subjects are too big and too important to stay silent. So you have to weigh it and decide if keeping x customers is worth not bringing it up.Also you dont need to be radical about everything.

9110107,0,t1_d86q55b,Very true first off my game is intended to have a more simplistic vibelook as to not seem like Im trying to cheaply pull off a good graphics and super complex game but instead give the freedom to the player.One thing Im excited about is a greater focus on exploration and survival with the ability to build boats from scratch implementation of seasons and weather patterns.

Theres nothing in the trailer that makes the game compelling like the Duck Game Towerfall BroForce Spelunky. The main problem IMHO is the graphics and the trailer. It feels like people in the trailer are acting out theres not enough emotion there. You might be better off with a trailer that only shows the gameplay and all those interesting mechanics.If you plan to keep these graphics though lowering the price might get some players to just take a risk and buy and see if the gameplay is good.

9178335,0,t1_d8fdhwp,If memory serves we had the same number of worker threads as we had cores on a target platform. With some caveats.Threads in the pool and jobs in the queue were assigned a type. I know we at least preferred to assign a job of a given type to a thread of that type but I dont recall whether we allowed threads to take jobs not of their type.This type assignment between threads and jobs meant that performance could vary based on how many threads were assigned a given type versus the types that jobs were assigned. I was on the networking team and wasnt the owner of multithreading code so I dont know many of the specifics here. But I do recall that optimal performance required some tuning on a perplatform basis because of the different thread counts.I believe the above is why we allocated a fixed number of threads for PC and tuned for that fixed number rather than allocating a thread for each core. A person with more cores will see diminishing returns for their extra hardware but at least theyre more likely to see consistent performance.Though if you really want to get into the nittygritty I recall that PC technically created the threads for the pool slots as needed and let threads die when they ran out of work rather than letting threads go idle. I dont have any idea of why we did that though because its outside of my wheelhouse.Edit word for grammars sake,gamedev,d8ff61q,7,t5_2qi0a

9200671,0,t3_56co6b,edit  I presume youre talking about this mapThe building and terrain features on the Ogre Battle map are completely flat so if you want to get the same effect you need to render them onto quads that are perfectly flat on the ground not sprites or billboards.  Any D look beyond that is entirely due to the way the pixel artists chose to draw things.As for angles and inclined planes and such your best bet would be to have a completely flat noninclined plane with a normal pointing straight up.  All sense of angle should come entirely from the cameras orientation.  Anything else is going to drive you crazy keeping all the math consistent.If you want to research further you might look into modern attempts to replicate SNES Mode  as thats the rendering mode used to get that mostly flatish looking D effect used in many SNES games including Ogre Battle.,gamedev,d8i943m,4,t5_2qi0a

9229799,0,t3_56rau7,Each engine is going to have its own things that people tend to do wrong and that youll have to watch out for.However I advise not worrying about it at first and just go get things done.  Later if it turns out to be a problem you can clean it up and optimize it.  First off it might not actually be a problem so you might end up wasting time.But besides that its a huge morale drain to spend a lot of time worrying about performance instead of gameplay and your game will suffer for it...  If it even gets finished.Once you get through all that and you want to check performance each of those engines has a profiler built in that will help you determine what are the slowest parts of your game.  Work on those if possible and that should help you fix any performance issues.,gamedev,d8ly0ma,4,t5_2qi0a

9243957,0,t1_d8nm98c,To the contrary I find change being one of the reasons to use TDD on lowlevel code. As the article points out TDD allows for verification over time. When I overhaul a particular part of my games engine its nice to have a way to check that I didnt break any related code.Good TDD means that you write code with generic interfaces. You should only have to update tests when your requirements contract changes not when your implementation changes. If your design requirements are changing a lot then I believe the extra time TDD requires is helpful even if it prolongs the process. You have to sit down and think about what the new design actually needs to do.That being said Im not advocating TDD for everything. I find it most useful for enginelevel code.,gamedev,d8nqltr,49,t5_2qi0a

9263239,0,t3_56z43c,I thought that was a thoughtful and well balanced article. I do strongly disagree on one point though It helps us minimise code size and complexity.My experience is that unit tests add a huge amount of code. Most of the increase is in the tests themselves and this added code always gets ignored by test proponents. I find you add at least one line of test code for every line of production code. These tests can have bugs themselves which then give you a false sense of security. As an example a well tested C tool at my day job by the standards of the test proponents on the team has k production LOC and k test LOC.Unit testing usually involves breaking a system up into smaller subsystems. This is often a good thing most code people write is too tightly coupled but equally it can go too far. When you have an interface for everything that only has one concrete implementation just so you can pass mocks in and test each component in isolation a few things happen Actually understanding what the system as a whole does becomes more complicated. Changing how a system works becomes a headache updating multiple levels of interfaces and implementations just to try something out. This leads to a desire to shortcut or more often an unwillingness to rearchitect a system which is clearly split up badly and frankensystems result.Ive seen a system with a couple of hundred LOC tops that was easy to mutate and adapt to the changing needs of the business be blown up to multithousand line multisystem monsters. Very quickly it devolved into hacks and fudges to bolt on the extra functionality needed over time. What we ended up with was hideous and eventually had to be completely rewritten. Unit testing in this way does more harm than good. Knowing the code from the above kk LOC example from above I reckon if that tool was written in a less abstracted manor without unit tests it would be k LOC total.Finally all this separation to enable unit testing in the first place can make the code run slower. You end up with more functions more structs possibly even virtual function calls. You also end up with systems having to redo work since they dont have access to the calculations done elsewhere unless you start polluting APIs to pass around cached data or the like. This doesnt always happen but it can be a headache to abstract a system for testing whilst maintaining its performance. Normally what you get out isnt particularly pure either.So yeah I cant get behind that statement. In all my experience of unit tested code and I write a fair bit of it for the day job in games it makes systems bigger adds a lot of test code which must be maintained and has bugs of its own sometimes hurts performance and almost always increases complexity. For this reason I prefer asserts  its testing without loads of machinery to setup test cases minimal extra code added no enforced design changes to enable testing and tests the code in production environments rather than artificial unittest environments.,gamedev,d8q6jzi,1,t5_2qi0a

There will need to be some amount of modification to do anything. More specifically to its somewhat OK AI system.You could probably avoid adding a custom Navigation mesh if you constrain its motion to certain step sizes and in specific directions. But this method is likely to be slow as it will require a lot of spacial querying.Your best bet would be to create a Navigation Grid which youll need to either buy from the asset store or create your own.Also what you described was called layering a technique thats already used in Navigation meshes.,gamedev,d8rq8hy,-4,t5_2qi0a

9289815,0,t3_57nbnk,Im currently making a turn based RPG and boy is it a rough ride. A good understanding of programming is definitely needed and may be a reason why you never see any RPG tutorials ever get completed.I strongly agree with focusing on mechanics first. Its easy to get excited about making a game to think of incredible features to add. Which is why its important to plan how to make those features happen before you start making the game. If you cant explain how youll add a feature before coding then its just going to be just as hard when you get to that point. I also avoid adding features that deviate too much from the original plan.My biggest challenges is time management and motivation as well.

9466050,0,t3_5aehv6,I am in the process of applying for my bachelors of science in Game Programming right now so I think I can offer some perspective on the university portion.School never made me enjoy programming. Not even once. Sure I had some assignments that were nostalgic Recreating portions of Space Invaders was cool or designing an old school textbased adventure game where you could move rooms and pick up items but it almost always frustrated me. After it was all said and done Ive realized that I didnt learn one thing from school. It was all googling how to do X and reading how other people did it. Sure I learned because of the assignment I was given but it wasnt school that taught me. What they did well however is force me to go out and ask the question of How the everliving ltBLEEPgt do you make an array with different types in it? and reading down the rabbit hole until I found a solution.With that aside one thing that really helped me is realizing that its not a freakin race. Wanting to get good is fine but it doesnt happen quickly. It was a bitter pill to swallow. Hearing advice on starting small and making a pong clone isnt what anybody wants to hear but nevertheless its good advice.My  advice to you? Block out everything else and focus on learning one small piece at a time. Dont rush. Sure there will always be more to learn but as long as you are in the mentality of This one thing is what Im learning and I dont care about anything else it becomes much more manageable. Sometimes it daisychains and I have to stop learning one thing because I need to understand a second thing before I can fully understand the first thing but I still only keep one thing in my brain at a time.Right now Im working on building a D action RPG a.k.a. Secret of Mana. Its very slow going but since Ive been able to say How do I make an object move? Okay now that I can make it move how do I attach an animation to it? Now that its animated I just realized its horrible to directly map keys to actions so I have to rewrite most of my movement to abstract it to allow players to rebind or to make it portfriendly. The thing is Im teaching myself but only one piece at a time.Finally Id say that the reward from me is usually the aha moments when I get unstuck and I understand the differences between the before and after.Best of luck and let me know if you ever want a second pair of eyes!,gamedev,d9fvzrz,2,t5_2qi0a

9541927,0,t1_d9p5vmm,Yes adding and deleting is expensive because the arrays need to be defragmented.  Systems access contiguous arrays though theres no skipping around except for in defragmenting.  This in python so using C arrays numpy is xx faster than using python objects in a dict. Edit yes youre right. For the allocation table a hashtable of the starts and sizes arrays for each component class has A and C but not B for instance would be more efficient.  Dont need the size   entries when a component doesnt exist for that entity.,gamedev,d9p8o6h,1,t5_2qi0a

9545829,0,t3_5blc2j,Many people have already put in good responses but Ill give it a go. C Unity Paradox Engine Monogame Wave Engine. C Unreal Engine Crysis Engine? Allegro.My advice with current gamedev community is to stick with unity. If you are looking to make your own games or join a smaller studioteam. More and more AAA Studios are using unity as well. Its maturing into a very good Engine. However I would be more concerned with your skillset as it pertains to being able to jump into the middle of a good sized project and be able to work with the code base along side other people. You can be a master with unity but if you cant sift through someone elses code and work in it your no good as a member of a team. I dont know your programming experience so Im not trying to offend.

9596473,0,t1_d9vmgsc,Its very easy for an excited player to head north and die before hearing the word Primm. For the record I dont NV is bad or even did a bad job overall I just think putting enemies that powerful that close to the start of the game was unwise. I guarantee that at least a handful of people new to the series started the game walked straight toward vegas died and never played again. You could easily argue that that is their own fault but it probably wouldnt feel that way to them. And player perception is EVERYTHING here. You could throw a tough enemy at a player rarely at random early on in a roguelike and when it inevitably happens to someone on their first run they would rightfully be frustrated and stop playing. You could make all the arguments you want about how it was technically beatable how they could have avoided it etc but the player wouldnt care because all they know is they were excited to start playing your game walked into the game and promptly got swatted down before the fun even began.,gamedev,d9vym9n,1,t5_2qi0a

One of your images says unique explosive animations. What would a gamer ever care about that?. No video of gameplay I can find and your gif on your site wont load too large Im guessing. So I can only assume from the pics it is a candy crush clone so why would you think people would choose this game over CC?All in all I think you should be happy with what youve achieved but need to be realistic about what your game is.

9638691,0,t1_da14qui,Thanks for your reply thats much appreciated. I was a bit curious and registered at Evolve Terminal. They really should integrate a profile section where traditional content creators like writers can list or add their hottest content like a portfolio. Currently I cant see how a dev would be able to get a quick overview other than checking the stats of my domain or hundreds of my posts. Its however great that we can add a quick note to key requests. For now I added my gaming category url that should get them straight to the relevant content. The whole site itself is a review worth and I might work on this and I let them know my feedback. You came up with a great suggestion here for gaming related content creators the idea of the site is nice.Also thank you for the evaluation of my situation that was quite motivating. Apart from trying the terminal side I will give the traditional route of emailing developers a try. Youre right who cares maybe I am a bit overcareful because I got too much marketing spam and I really dont want to appear like some of these guys but right that shouldnt be too difficult Dgt Also might be worth it to keep copies of the emails. For legal reason you cant get as easy a crusade as Youtuber can for being wronged. It happens but its exceedingly rare.I think I am more interested to write about games that I want to support this included indie titles that I find very creative or interesting. Criticism would be more in the form of feedback in my articles like suggestions for improvements. I guess this is minimizing the chance of legal trouble further however I really know what you mean and can remember some dramas that people had in the past.,gamedev,da1614n,1,t5_2qi0a

9661896,0,t3_5dcngy,Honestly Ive had a blast working with OpenGL.Its fairly simple once you understand how it works namely create id bind uploaddraw.I think a lot of people are put off by old OpenGL but the modern framework is very nice to use. Shaders are amazing! Instanced drawing is crazy fast and flexible. Old OpenGL has you calling glXXX to do everything. In the modern setup you just chunk it all to the GPU with buffers and let the shaders do the work for you. This also means you can consider things like compute shaders for blazing parallel calculations. Its really worth the time to learn.As others have said for a voxel game even UnityUnreal are just okay  it works its decent performance but theres a lot of extra guff. If you run from scratch with shaders you can get something extremely performant with relatively little effort and absolutely no fat.Writefind an octree structure use that for your culling and fart out some blocks for the GPU. Look into raymarching distance fields. You can get this running on the GPU directly.Its a lot of learning but you will do it better in raw OpenGL rather than mashing your vision through the constraints of an engine.EDIT Check out rVoxelGameDev and osmose their wisdom EDIT Here is a fantastic tutorial for creating a voxel game ,gamedev,da414fa,5,t5_2qi0a

It all depends on what hes intuitive to.Programming is a great thing to encourage to anyone young or old.Theres a good chance that programming will become an even more essential skill in the future with robotics and automation becoming more prevalent. In general it might help him hone skills like problem solving mathematics and critical thinking. After you teach a kid a bit of code their confidence for using a computer goes up tremendously.

In the latter case you will probably be better off using some framework like SFML that provides higher level abstractions to you. If you want to make traditional GUI applications you might also want to look into some GUI framework like Qt. This will provide you with useable results much quicker.

9841828,0,t1_daghjle,oh man crazy week at work sorry for taking this long to reply.My old uni studies on Markov chains are ultra rusty so bear with me if I say something wrong.But basically the samples that I have are converting only white pixels to a list of coordinates per row    private ListltIntVectorgt ConvertToVectorListTextureD textureD         ListltIntVectorgt points  new ListltIntVectorgt        for int y   y lt textureD.height y                    for int x   x lt textureD.width x                            if textureD.GetPixelx y ! Color.black                     points.Addnew IntVectorx y                                            return points    This means that the Markov chain will start from a given coordinate then get the next coordinate that is most likely to appear.That means it simply has a bunch of white pixel coordinates as samples and outputs a bunch of white pixel coordinates in the end  the black pixels arent considered at all. Actually pixels dont exist at all in the chains context its just a list of points.If you converted every possible coordinate in a single letter eg  is a  is b...  Im pretty sure it would have the same results. I just fortunately came along a genericsbased Markov Chain    and could directly input this structure.But your question leads to some interesting other questions what exactly would happen if I encoded everything in black pixels instead of white? Or what if I generated the sample list columnbased instead of row based? Im pretty sure if I hadnt slept through those advanced statistics classes I wouldnt have to code it to see  but Im pretty sure if they actually had experiments like this I wouldnt have slept so much D,gamedev,daqevwe,1,t5_2qi0a

You focus less on tangibles and more on concepts like Exploration and Chaos.I think perhaps this is not vagueness of message because a tool is all about what you can accomplish with it and a game focused on exploration is about discovering the unknown.

9905848,0,t1_daydjqk,Sure that makes sense. Its kinda similar to what I do.So the Simulation from before owns all the managers and assets it needs to run. It has a PlayerCharacter EnemyManager ParticleManager LevelManager and so on. These managers are basically object buckets that the Simulation has access to and plays with. So when loadRoom is called the Simulation empties all the buckets and refills them with the toys it needs for the new room.Room transitions are handled with objects called TransferBoxes. A TransferBox is an invisible box some with position data the offsets to where to place the player character in the new room the destination room and some other things. Every frame the Simulation checks to see if the player is colliding with any of the TransferBoxes. If they are the Simulation loads the room requested by the TransferBox places the player and does anything else it needs to.Switching areas is a bit more complicated. An area is a collection of rooms. Like a dungeon or a town. When a new area is requested the Simulation flags itself that it wants a new area. The engine sees this changes the scene to a loading screen and tells the Simulation to load what it needs for the new area textures etc in a separate thread. When the Engine sees the Simulation is done loading it changes states back to the Simulation and everything continues.,gamedev,dayr77d,1,t5_2qi0a

9942959,0,t3_5hmjsq,While I used the photos I took for web development I feel its still relevantSeveral years ago I started to undertake a massive photography task. I was working with my familys business that sells treesshrubsnursery products at a brick and mortar retailwholesale facility. We needed more photos of the plants being sold for the web site and other promotional materials.The nature of plant photography in a retail setting is sort of interesting. There are a lot of hybridized plants that have only been created recent enough that there isnt really mature versions of these plants to get photos of and even if there is who knows if that specific plant is going to be photogenic enough to want to put in advertisingon the web or whatever it gets printed on. Many of our photos show up near the top of results in Google image searches for the plants so we want them to look good.I have a photography background but my skill at identifying plants is not as good. I can tell its a maple or an elm or a crab apple but there are so many trademarked varieties that have subtle differences it really takes a horticulturist to ID these plants simply on appearance. This was a problem. My dad can do this but he sucks as a photographer and its not really practical to have us both running all over taking these pictures.I came up with a plan. Our point of sale system has customer records going back almost  years. I am able to look up a specific plant and find out who purchased it years ago including a nameaddress and sometimes phone number. I built myself a route with Google maps that lined up a bunch of different housesproperties where these plants were likely planted when purchased. I had no idea if it would be in the front yard back yard who knows but if I have  the name of the plant and the location I can find it. So I started driving all over the Denver area going to each address in my list. I made sure to wear a hat from work to provide a little more authenticity. At each location I would knock on the door and speak to whoever answered directly. I would just state that I was with the nursery that sold plants to this address years ago and wanted photos of the mature plants if they were still there. A lot of the time its the same homeowners and I would talk with the person who bought the plant for their garden. They were always thrilled that someone wanted photos of their garden and would want to show me all sorts of other things they had and could positively ID so I could grab some other random photos as well.I think there might have been once or twice where the person I spoke with wasnt interested in letting me take photos and it was never weird it would just be because they were house sitting or something so its not their home and didnt know if I was full of shit. Every other time people were more than happy to accommodate me. If you are friendly and simply state your business and try to wear something that looks at least semiofficial a hat or polo or something youll find that most people wont have a problem with a few photos. ,gamedev,db3lbbr,1,t5_2qi0a

9983421,0,t1_db8cdx4,Im not an expert but I think youre going about the chunk method the wrong way.You should not hit a maximum amount of players because of the chunk method. Like Chrono said the only thing capping you is RAMThe processing power of your server.A very high level offthetopofmyhead method would be The server has a database of chunks and knows what is inside each chunk. Which chunk the player is in is determined clientside By doing player.position.x  chunkWidth player.position.y  chunk height player.position.z  chunkDepth When a player enters a chunk it tells the server Server responds with the contents of the chunk and a list of the other players in this chunk Client constructs the chunk from the data received If the client changes something in the chunk the client tells the server Ie. Player placed exampleObject at position The server receives this message and broadcasts it to all other players in the chunk only Players outside of the chunk dont need to know Other players clients receive this data and simulate it happening in their clientThats pretty much it. You dont merge or simulate multiple of the same chunk. There is only ONE of each chunk with multiple players in it the server just keeps all players in that chunk informed of what happens in it.This doesnt solve floating point precision problems of course but thats fairly simple to handle with a chunk system. Remember that chunks are just collections of data and can be constructed at ANY position on the client. So you can actually keep the player at position  at almost all times but they could be in Chunk . You just need to do different math to figure out which chunk data to construct on the client.Does that make sense? Im not the best at explaining things....,gamedev,db8v962,2,t5_2qi0a

9990553,0,t1_db9pnj9,hey just tried your game I really like the polished graphics and music. I like the general physics of the ball but I can see some might find it a bit sensitive. My only critique is that making the path deterministic maybe a unnecessary because later levels will require you solve gravity flips as part of the solution in addition to jumps and if you miss a jump you need to start over. I can see how this can get annoying for some people. You can do something like up key to jump and while you are in air you can steer. And two buttons e.g. zx to flip gravity in XY direction. Then the player as full freedom in what they can do. Anways but I can tell you made the decision to not do this from beginning. May I ask why?Also I didnt go through all the levels so if you have complex actions later on that you can take with space button like a zig zag or something then this would be a goo reason to have a fixed set of actions.,gamedev,db9sot8,1,t5_2qi0a

10012799,0,t1_dbcdkm4,I might have articulated wrong. What I meant wasnt that CS has light maths but rather that CompEng has a heavier background on the area. More specifically I am as of now required to take Calculus IIV as opposed to CSs Calculus I. Most of the curriculum is similar but CompEng covers more area in a sense while CS goes deeper into end uses of software. Meaning both majors prepare software engineers. But CS goes straight into form that meaning they get some courses like Graphic Processing or HumanMachine Interface while CompEng is broader in the sense that it has all the algorithmic bases theoretical informatics logic for computer science data base management Software and Systems Engineering but it also has electronics servomechanisms. In fact the head of the department once said that Computer Engineering was the mix of Computer Science with ElectroElectronic Engineering.So what I wanted to know was In you opinion stick with computer engineering and take the extra classes to complete the CS curriculum or are these extra skills not likely to be useful and itd be better to switch courses and focus only on software?P.S. I reckon the CompEng course here in Brazil is somewhat different from most other countries,gamedev,dbcp36o,1,t5_2qi0a

10023099,0,t1_dbdss1i,Im sorry but I need to be a little rude. Dear God must I do all of your research for you? Im on vacation currently and I shouldnt have argued with someone whos only defense is to keep questioning me without countering a thing  Ill do your research for you on the mobile advertising industry in a few weeks I dont need this. If youre truly interested in the meantime go look for case studies for mobile advertising revenue. That is a large revenue source for both platforms since both stores largely rely on free applications as a model. Its well known by anyone who has dealt with mobile for any period of time. You might find that one platform or the other does better by some fraction and I think maybe that will make you feel good.But THE BIG POINT IVE BEEN TRYING TO GET AT is that YOURE LEAVING MONEY ON THE TABLE BY NEGLECTING EITHER PLATFORM. If you build in the right IDE there is negligible amount of cost and effort to build to both platforms. Im sorry it seems you decided that native code or something with greatly increased difficulty was the way to go.Lets say you make your game in Unity. You get  on iOS. Youre saying th on Android isnt unreasonable  so lets say that gets you . The cost to set up your Android developer account is a onetime . Not k. . For most people here who are building in systems that can do this simple little magic youre espousing awful advice. If iOS were the other platform in the worseperforming category my advice would nonetheless be build to both!And you uamirrajan are probably not a bastion of forwardprediction in a notoriously turbulent industry.

10042059,0,t1_dbfdttw,This is my point! What do you mean by Right choice?Are you saying the one which objectively produces more happiness than unhappiness? Are you talking morally legally?This is what I am trying to say the Right choice is what you make of it and the only people who can make that choice is the players. As far as Games go I believe its down to player to find their own happiness and its on them if they become addicted. That being said I know that devs can employ certain techniques to get more money out of people but apart from the literal thefts its still the players fault. They are people they can stop themselves.From a Game DEV point of view its all about Intent. If you are making a mechanic with the sole reason of thisll get em to pay more accidentally or Without realising how much theyve spent or whatever then yes its bad. Stop it. Morally wrong legally right. Debatably correct for total happiness as well since the dev is getting money and the player is still willing to play. They must be enjoying it to or at least getting some satisfaction out of it.

As all good quests should be Or at least be perceived to be losable.Maybe add weird ways to get more loot. so its still kill x enemies but also you get double the reward for.... not standing in any puddles or only using fire attacks kill them in double kills.

10099482,0,t1_dbnirn1,One thing to note is that in order for this to work the game has to use fixed time steps... at least in the portion of the code that deals with input physics and game logic.A lot of games dont use fixed time steps because it can be a pain to separate logic from rendering and if both are fixed then your game can never run faster than whatever framerate you choose and if the machine cant render fast enough the game slows down. This is why games like Megaman on the NES would slow down when lots of enemies appeared on screen. The machine couldnt keep up with the pace the programmers had set but everything had to move a set distance each frame regardless because the game assumed each frame took X amount of time no more no less.If you dont use fixed time steps in your game then recording demos becomes extremely difficult or impossible. Especially on PCs and modern consoles where code besides the game itself can be vying for the processors attention. When this happens if you dont have fixed time steps then from one playthrough to the next the time any particular frame takes to render can be different and then characters will end up in slightly different positions and that can mean the difference between making or missing a platform or hitting or missing an enemy. And once that happens its game over.,gamedev,dbnz5st,2,t5_2qi0a

It is the programmers job though to unmap the buffer back into CPU ram. Its an odd mess.I use OpenCL for animation collision broadphase global illumination a big part of why ParsECS thread had budget used particle physics and particle collision.I also use OpenCL to perform dualcontouring and naive surface nets.Yes HDs and AMD APUs are rife for processing power. You can use them just keep the bandwidth low no more than mb in a single direction per frame  total. It is worth it.

The game was nearly released twice before but I wasnt happy with the graphics and the gameplay wasnt in depth enough.So what I have today is something I am happy with. I always wanted to be independent and make games not work for other people on their projects that is what has kept me motivated that and the childhood dream.Im hoping the game makes enough so I can go indie full time and do my own thing. I have another  games I want to make and this game is the launchpad to enable those other games.

Repeat till something you want to develop comes out of it.This is really important. Create prototypes play them if theyre not fun  add a different mechanic iterate and improve.If youre not sure what makes games fun learn from others who talk about player engagement topics andor clone mechanics in games you enjoy. Figure out what it is specifically about the game that you feel enjoyment and reproduce it. Dont even think about a game name background story art graphics.. test the prototype gameplay first to see if its fun. The rest can be added later.Keep it simple copy and improve fun games that you know are completely within your scope. Then youll know you have a successful idea and planofaction to complete it.

10369228,0,t3_5ohoow,Very real example of what if the company ditches the middleware youre using? Marmalade SDK. Marmalade SDK is a mobile game middleware that allows you to crosscompile and use the same CC codebase for iOS Android WM and so on.Marmalade Game Studios the company behind the SDK discontinued it towards the end of  leaving most of its users complete in the dark. It was going to simply die off leaving existing license owners with a perpetual license to a black box that may or may not break with every new iOSAndroid update with no way of fixing it if it breaks since its proprietary.In early  they finally announced that instead of being discontinued it was now bought out by some cloud computing firm. What does that mean for Marmalade? Well no one seems to know because there havent been any other announcements. Thats why I jumped ship and started clue an opensource and thus guaranteed to never disappear or become unmaintainable middleware to replace what Marmalade used to be I learned my lesson about exercising caution with proprietary middleware the hard way. Its one of those things that you think can never happen. Pfft Marmalade is used by some of the biggest games out there like Cut the Rope. Marmalade cant fail or be discontinued.Im not saying that something like this would happen with Unity. But you never know.

10436430,0,t3_5pgee4,It depends. Heres a simplified explanationResolutionThe easiest way to go about this is to consider your screen in madeup screen coordinates e.g. left is  right is  bottom is  top is ... or whatever which is resolutionindependent.When rendering to a screen like this D graphics are updownscaled suitably. Some games have assets for different resolutions so that scaling doesnt affect sprite quality. Most have highresolution assets which work for any resolution and downscale for lower resolutions which looks better than upscaling.Games with vector graphics dont have this problem since they can be rendered with fidelity regardless of resolution. A great example of this is Mini MetroSome D games just show a larger area of the map instead of scaling. You see the sprites smaller in the screen same number of pixels but more of the world is rendered at the same time in your screen.D games are a different beast. Since polygons are mathematical constructs kinda like vector graphics you can render them at any resolution. As long as textures are detailed enough you wont see any square pixels when rendering polygons in the screen. D graphics are usually interpolated and filtered. Thats why older games textures look blurry in newer PCs even if the polygons cover a larger number of pixels on the screen textures dont have enough pixels to actually fill them so they have to be interpolated and filtered so you dont see actual square pixels. This always happens due to perspective but for lowres assets its very noticeable.Aspect ratioThe   horizontalvertical screen coordinates only work for hypothetical  aspect ratios. In reality horizontal is larger. For example for  aspect ratio vertical could be   and horizontal . . screen coordinates.The way to deal with this mismatch is usually to enlarge the field of view horizontally. For D games you can have wider background assets scale your backgrounds some kind of filler background that can be repeated... depends on the game. Also you can show more of the map as in the resolution case.D games can have a wider field of view just by projecting more of the world into the screen. This is very obvious in Minecraft where if you enlarge the game window horizontally you just see more of the world on the sides.,gamedev,dcr1f4a,4,t5_2qi0a

10505262,0,t1_dcyd3j8,gt shitty Greenlight posts will never truly stop and honestly I have no idea how to fix it. gtPerhaps raise the price of submissions Well I do agree that bumping the price up is a good start. But wed need an increased fee to something like k and on top of that have an additional  per submission. This will prevent developers from wiping the slate clean and trying again without being penalized.gtmaybe more strictly moderated guidelinesAs nice as that sounds Valve doesnt even moderate GL with the guidelines we have currently so tacking more on wont really accomplish anything.However if Valve implemented a system similar to their Overwatch system in CSGO were players review games that have been greenlit or hit the Top  milestone for certain points IE is this an actual game is this just an asset flip has the developer tried to squash criticism by abusing the moderation tools set before them has the game been reported maybe allow people to see the flags to see if the game was flagged for vote boosting with proper evidence does the developer have another five or six games waiting for greenlight as well. As users cull the garbage more and more they could gain scores for accuracy which allow their decisions to be weighted more eventually gaining more moderation tools eventually culminating to giving them the ability to cull garbage before they even hit top greenlit.Another great way to decimate the number of trash being flogged on steam would be to restrict card dropsachievements would be to require a game to meet minimum number of sales that are not Key activations or ending with refunds. This alone would be a multifaceted way of pissing people off. Itd screw over people trying to hawk shit with the selling point not being the game but the steam content that comes with it it would piss off the people responsible for a bulk of the shit on steam that upvote anything with a possibility of steam drops and if we extend this to cover achievements as well itd disincentives devs to make games like Zup.And the great thing about this last part is that it doesnt take any effort on Valves end at all god knows they love to not expend any effort in things all they have to do is set up a couple of counters to keep track of the game sales and thats pretty much it.,gamedev,dcyvss0,1,t5_2qi0a

10531304,0,t3_5qs1is,Dont be too strict with new mechanic every  levels youre leaving more and more design space unexplored like this.Suppose you have game mechanics AE each introduced in a new set of  levels. The first  levels all explore just mechanic A. The next set of levels introduces mechanic B but also use mechanic A so youll have  levels with just B and  levels with both A and B. Notice that you have half as many levels with just mechanic B as you had with just mechanic A in the first group of levels. For the next set of levels you introduce mechanic C. Now you have say  levels with just mechanic C  with C  A  with C  B and another  with C  A  B. Take this a few steps further and you can see that you are leaving a lot of design space unexplored.

10554788,0,t3_5r4qgg,I too have questions about data is passed between program and shader. Im obviously not the most knowledgeable on shaders but I have begun working with them lately so let me try and steer you towards the right path to get started. If you have not yet tried shader programming I recommend you go on Shadertoy and start writing a new shader.Here is what you need to know  The magic with shaders is that the code you write will be executed for every pixel on the texture. The variable passed with the OUT parameter a D vector is the COLOR of the current pixel while the variable passed with the IN parameter a D vector is the POSITION of the current pixel. You essentially get a position and must return a color for this position.Using that and a range of other variables such as resolution time external texture or other shaders you run a program that will return a color for every pixel. What I dont know yet is how you can pass data from a program INTO a shader to then return the correct color for each pixel. My understanding is that your shader will be passed the tile type of the current background tile for this pixel and fetch the correct pixels from a tileset. Since shaders are very good at pixel per pixel operations  this should be insanely fast compared to loading a new texture into memory and drawing it with the sprite batch. But again I have no idea how to put this into practice with shaders since I have no idea how data is passed.If anyone knows how data is passed from program to shader it would be greatly appreciated !,gamedev,dd4i5py,2,t5_2qi0a

While a lot of the games and the experiences Ive had in them have been amazing a lot of the time Ill just continue to play a game just so that Im playing something. I was stuck in a rut of forcing myself to play video games just so I was in my comfort zone. I decided about a year ago that I would buy a couple of books to learn C and read it in my spare time. That didnt last long as I quickly became overwhelmed and fell back to video games. Last week I decided enough was enough and Im back on that train this time learning from video tutorials and will reference the books I have when needed. I dont plan on turning back.Do yourself a favour and show us your progress on the game. Not only will it help with your own development but it will help noobs like me seeing progress of others and draw inspiration from it.

Render it to a bitmap use that as a texture thats gonna be  texture  spline.

10798505,0,t3_5uewm6,gtWith no realworld experience and mostly selftaught skills Im constantly concerned that Im doing things in a way that would be scoffed at by professionals in the industry. Im concerned that my code is sloppy or performanceheavy. Im concerned that my implementation is overly complex or displays bad practice etc.Dont be. Just about every game youve ever played has done things wrong. Just about every game out there follows bad practices and professionals scoff at. Its just the nature of games which are highly specialized products. John Carmack did a talk on how bad Doom was when it was shipped. gtAnd theres even a fear that Ill be accepted for a job and find myself in the deep end with no idea what Im doing because the employers methods are completely different from my own.If youre not afraid youre not doing it right. This is how you learn. This is the best way to get those industry standard practices to get exposure. You go in there you show them what you got. You remain open to criticism and take it all in. Any company that doesnt cause you to question your code doesnt sound challenging enough. Any company that doesnt want to improve your skills as you work for them doesnt sound supporting enough. There are a lot of BAD programmers out there and its okay to be one of them. Its showing improvement that really matters. Being self taught means that you often arent afraid to learn which goes a lot farther with employers than you might think. ,gamedev,ddtseeh,4,t5_2qi0a

10852227,0,t3_5v4bh3,Hey awesome work so far. I figured I would jump in and provide some constructive compliments and criticisms.First the combat system is pretty nice. Its automated easy to use and lets you move around. Very pleasant to use. Same with the interface. Its straightforward and concise. I like that theres very little to learn to use the system. However the tutorial says click on inventory which implies left mouse. Had to figure out it was a right click to equip on my own. Also the wizards club didnt give me an attack option when I started. Only after I switched to dagger did I get one. Bug?A few things I would consider revising however. Most importantly the story. Theres nothing that captures the players attention right now just immediately diving into some grinding quests. I realize that at this stage in the game story wasnt about to take priority over development but story is one of the main things that can drive people to play.Creatures in the beginning are too hard to kill. Maybe thats different for nonwizards but wizards... omg it took forever. I could be an  year old kid and massacre a bunny if it was running up to attack me. I would think a fireballcasting magic user could do a little better. But reality aside since this is a game I would rather be attacking more creatures at once and dealing with strategies of your combat flow style. The advantage of the way you set up combat is that it enables some interesting maneuvers. It would be a shame to sit around and always attack one creature all the time. Show us early on how interesting your combat can be otherwise players wont get far enough to understand one of the core advantages youve got going for you.As creative as the tick movement is and it is pretty cool it feels burdening. I can understand the MP reason for it for sure so I wont discount its importance but perhaps for movement alone PCs could move every halftick or two spaces per tick. Or just speed up the ticks. Youd have to see how this works for combat Im not sure if it would make it more interesting or make it way too powerful since players would be sort of superspeed at that point but that could potentially give your game a bit of a bulletdodge combat feel with multiple opponents as the primary encounter. IMO that could be pretty cool.Alternatively tick movement probably shouldnt be allowed to go further than  steps. You might decide after the fact that you want to move elsewhere which isnt possible if youve just moved  steps. Youre sort of stuck with your earlier decision at that point which could impact a lot of choices. Its nice that you can plan ahead but it shouldnt cost you future decisions especially in tense situations.I primarily recommend you take advantage of your combat system and build your encounters around that play style. Update the story so that your encounters reflect multiple monsters battling with you simultaneously ideally with strategic options involving the terrain. Make the majority of minions easier to kill allowing some strategy in your attacks. If AOE attacks arent possible yet provide those. This will also get much more interesting with multiple players grouped up.,gamedev,ddzbwi4,9,t5_2qi0a
10853595,0,t3_5v5s7w,FWIW Im using my own engine written in C using SDL. I wrote it a couple of years back for my first big game and Im reusing it for my current project. It took me something like  weeks to write the first version that powered the first game. I have  years of programming experience in different languages so it was easy. Im not sure I would recommend that to a beginner. The games I made two decades ago as a beginner didnt even have an engine there were draw calls mixed with game logic mixed with audio hooks mixed with asset loading... a true mess. So for a beginner programmer who just wants to make a game its better to use Unity. I guess everyone should decide the goal of their projects is it learning to code a big project or creating and shipping a game.Note that its a D game engine. For a D game I would use something like Unity or UE instead. ,gamedev,ddzgzf1,11,t5_2qi0a

10910925,0,t3_5vw6cf,Thats a common problem with standard OOP approach to game development.

ECS is not trivial to implement but you should read some stuff about that maybe start here or hereA bit easier approach is just to store a bunch of pointers to different components so that some entities would have HP Inventory etc. and some wont the pointers will be nullptr.Check out explanation of this approach hereP.S.

10914443,0,t1_de5a67e,I had a lot of fun with this game. I played level  and then jumped to level  and played all the way through to the end. I did not notice any bugs with the block types that you mentioned. The only thing that was weird was that the disintegrating blocks did not regenerate when you died. That reduced the challenge of some levels.Some miscellaneous notes I thought there should definitely be a way to disable sound especially on the main menu. The particle effect when you die looks weird. I think its because the particles are too large and overlap too much so sometimes the overall effect looks rectangular and squashed. I loved all the fancy visual effects especially the way that sometimes the camera would pan and rotate when you moved certain directions. This added a lot to the overall fun of the game. When I first started I thought I should be eating the dark gray blocks pacman style. It took me a moment to realize they were just a visual effect. I thought that there should be more levels with lots of bouncy blocks on the sides. Especially in early levels this could be a way to let the player play around with the physics and feel of the game without dying. When you have a checkerboard of wall tiles the gray tiles blend in with them and make them difficult to see. The difference between the light green and dark green blocks was not completely obvious.  Maybe you could have an animation when bouncing off of the blocks and make the animation of the bouncier one more pronounced. It also might be more logical to switch the colors so that the brighter one makes you bounce more.  I thought that the game should announce what level you are on when moving to a new level. I like all of the shader effects with the exception of the screen transition effect. It doesnt seem to match the rest of the visuals at least in my opinion.Some thoughts on the gameplay. Maybe instead of accelerometer you could have a swipe left or right to move left and right? I thought that the game would be great for mobile but personally most accelerometer games are too finicky. I like the control of the left and right arrows on the keyboard but I think some kind of swipe could work if you play around with it enough.Some of the levels felt like they were meant to be beaten all in one attempt. There are places in the level where you can rest or bounce back and forth between two spots but when doing so I felt like I lost momentum and had no way to complete the level. But if you did everything perfect all in one attempt it worked. This makes the feel of the game less satisfying for me. I think it has to do with moving left and right reducing your upward velocity. The feel of the game is really close to perfect though.,gamedev,de5qwx4,1,t5_2qi0a

Someone whos worked for years with Maya will find blenders UI to be horrid and extremely counter intuitive but that doesnt really concern you. You have no preconceptions about how things should function so dont worr about it. Just be sure to look for tutorials aimed at new users and not those migrating from other software.Blender is a very capable tool that while still lacking in some areas makes up for it in others though honestly thats true of all programs.Ive used just about every single program out there. For simple modeling any tool with be more than capable and what you learn with one will be applicable to others. You should be aiming to learn modeling techniques and not how to use any specific program.There are also other options.

Keep active on LinkedIn and look out for recruiters doing calls to action through it from your favorite companies. GDC is the best time to schedule a meeting with a recruiter bar none. Its much easier when both of you are already there and can find a quick  minutes to find a chat sometime during the week.. Getting hired at GDC doesnt really happen except in a very few rare instances where your qualifications are blowing everything out of the water in a way that is going to be confusing in the Wait... how you do not have a job with  years of experience? way. The expo floor is absolutely the worst place to hand out your resume even if a company is recruiting  you are one out of hundreds everyone working at the booth is tired and annoyed at the obvious notgreatfits who try anyways etc. You will never make a good or memorable impression. I found printing my resume on nice paper only useful when I was specifically having a meeting with a recruiter to do just that.. Get crepes at least once but honestly just get food outside unless you have a concession card which are handed out like candy by the way on the last day!. Blowing an hour waiting for your  crepe isnt worth it.. Go to talks try to sit up front try to talk to the speakers. I connected very well with so many people I thought were way above me career wise just by talking about how much I loved their talk and some thoughts I had on it. Shook hands with people Ive always wanted to meet have business cards from people I never thought Id get.. If you are hiring looking for talent or looking to find someone to work with tap into the CAs. All the CAs are incredibly inspired driven people who have a huge variety of industry experience from talented people looking to break into the industry to people who have been in the industry for  years. They LOVE it when people come into their lounge looking for candidates to work with and you will get a much better more genuine picture of a candidate than trying to formalize it through a meeting or just having people openly hand you resumes.. If you are interested in finding work or connections parties are pretty difficult for doing this. GDC is very party heavy after hours but all the good stuff happens from talking with people in sessions or at mixers which tend to go on during the day or are invite only at night. Yeah okay the Epic party is banging and a lot of fun to check out for an hour but its too loud and drunk to chat. That said if youve made a new connection and want to do something fun together the parties can be good for that. And Id say the exceptions would be stuff like Gay Gaming Professionals or IDGA organized parties  these smaller ones tend to be easier to hold conversation with.. Even if you only have the expo pass you can still strike up great conversation in the expo hall or in line with people. The expo pass gets you into surprisingly a lot  career center talks IDGA sessions sponsored sessions  these are talks that can all have great content within them. The expo itself is large and like a miniE though with more of an emphasis on tech and business stuff than on actual game demos. A lot of booths and sponsored session run prizes that can be very lucrative. You get into the awards show which is awesome. You get into the indie mega booth mild rumpus and pretty much anything at GDC except for sessions not covered by the above. Most importantly even with an expo pass you can still wander about and do all the above at GDC on monday and tuesday  its just the expo itself doesnt open till wednesday. So all the sponsored sessions indie mega lounge intel skybridge stuff and the halls of the convention itself are open to you.. Are you a student? Broke? Looking to get into the industry? Dont know ANYONE in game dev? JOIN THE CA PROGRAM. JOIN THE CA PROGRAM.I cannot emphasize enough just how valuable it is being a CA at GDC. Lets even ignore the fact that you get paid for your hours you work and a free all access GDC pass and free vault access for a year. Your fellow CAs are in your same shoes. You have an instant icebreaker and drop of respect youd be surprised how many awesome and big name game devs got their start as a CA. You become part of an ever growing family of CAs from around the world that trust and got to know you on a personal level. Some of your CAs are working at your favorite companies and have been doing it for years eager to help someone break into their industry. It is by far the best way to actually meet people if you dont know anyone. Theres a real sense of community becoming a CA that is incredibly valuable to have.CAs are hand picked so it isnt the easiest thing to get into but I do know they try and curate a wide variety of people in the program every year. From veteran CAs to award winning game devs to students to people who are so new to the industry they dont know where they might fit into it.,gamedev,deijm7b,3,t5_2qi0a

11087370,0,t3_5y7yfk,This is interesting to me because I recently had a conversation with an indie dev who lives in china and TBH china game dev is a hot mess unless you are a big player. Problems with being indie in china. The biggest issue is the government has put a block on all games released in china unless manually approved by the government. This obviously doesnt apply to games already out like the one in the article but will apply to any game you might want to release in the future. Generally speaking this approval process can take a long time and cost a lot of money to the point that you need to find publishers to get anything in front of a chinese audience. Indie devs are basically out of luck.. China audience is very adverse to games that dont enter the market as free and as such games not designed around IAP will tend to struggle. They can succeed dont get me wrong but it has to be a very specific kind of game that indie devs are likely not going to be able or want to make to make a big market splash. The slice of that  of the population that will actually want to buy games outright is much smaller than the western market.. Chinas audience is obsessed with IPs and generally speaking the successful games will have the backing of some famous IP behind it or at the very least be pandering to something appealing in Chinese culture. Games that do not have strong brand appeal rarely get any traction even though they might get plenty of traction in the west. This is partly why indie games that are popular over here tend to not do well or exist at all in china even if they are localized. Having a trusted brand or IP is everything. IP shovelware on the other hand is a huge market in china much more so than in the west. Big blockbuster movie coming out? Better have a game to go with it because the game will sell like hotcakes in china. You arent getting a slice of that pie as an indie.The person I was talking to literally is planning on backdoor releasing their game in the west because their own country was so hostile to indie devs.Granted there are exceptions but the messaging I got was very opposite to Indies are thriving in china!. Honestly to me this article speaks more about the power of doing proper localization instead of china rules!.,gamedev,deoqs47,2,t5_2qi0a

But if Ive got a design for an FPS or a fighting game I could get away with putting off story until the later stages.I personally like world building first because developing a game to me is telling an interactive story. If I dont know where my story is taking place then it wont be an effective narrative. I can think of two game designs I had in mind where I made the mechanics first one was a topdown bullet hell game where the only way to fight back was to open and close doors and the other was a D side scrolling runner game where the player was immortal but his package wasnt.

If you open the Options menu and mouse over some of the colors that seem to be part of the same cycle you notice they follow a pretty clear flow. So a first step would be creatingidentifying  lines of flow in your image. Then start breaking the flow up into even chunks and assign abstract colors to the chunks. Then define the cycle of colors you want and replace your abstract colors with it. At each iteration of your render loop increment the colors. Using palette swapping can make it a lot faster.Something like that. Okay it probably is a bit complicated.

If I need to unload some mesh I could just skip it during the building of the new buffer.This approach probably fragments the memory quite a bit I already needed to switch to x post just to allow a mb shadowmap to exist along with a mb vertex buffer that was streamed during several seconds and using multiple new buffer allocations thus the fragmenting.I really havent tested this setup much and I might end up using the one buffer per mesh approach.,gamedev,df4zpvp,1,t5_2qi0a

11244751,0,t3_60hojx,I think theres two approaches here synchronous and asynchronous message handling. What you describe is asynchronous message handling and it has its benefits. As I see it if youre handling messages async you dont have to worry about message loops a triggers b which triggers a because youre unravelling that. Im not quite following what you mean by additional management  do you have a specific case in mind? At the end of the day your systems would fire of a message and it shouldnt matter when the message is being processed if it does you might have to reconsider your approach for this particular use case. On a side note this is a very interesting discussion because I approached my current pet project in a similar way and after a few iterations im still not happy with it. One train of thought that I came up with and Im not sure if its a good one or not is this distinction between messages as signals that something happened entity changed position or state got destroyedcreated etc and messages to indicate the user wants something to happen. I am conflating an event bus and a message system and it makes things really weird e.g. how do you handle feedback to the user events?

11264871,0,t3_60qqmb,This happened to me recently too. Read all about it if you like.In my opinion if you want to game dev as a career you need to take a long hard and honest look to decide if you can compete with the other studio. If you honestly believe you can make a better game then it might be worth it to stick it out and compete.Youll have to take release schedules into account. If you can release sooner than the other studio that works in your favor. If you plan to release later thats not as good. If you plan to make a higher quality game you can overcome some amount of release delay though but your target audience might not have much itch left to scratch if theyve all played the other game first. Or you might have to compete for players who have never heard of that other game since advertising is an imperfect art.Or if youre just doing game dev as a hobby youre not really competing anyway so dont sweat it. Just have fun and try to learn something in the journey.In my case considering the studio I was up against I decided against direct competition. Im taking my game in a very different direction instead.

11396494,0,t3_62kwgr,There are different types of performances here to consider. The performance of the CPU to create track and update the particle data. Then there is the performance of passing this information to the GPU and then the performance of the GPU. Each phase has varying levels of tricks and their own consideration when it comes to performance. In the CPU side you use techniques like pooling. This is creating all particles at load time and recycling the data objects. It may not seem like a big deal because after all how bad could a new Particle really cost? It adds up especially if in a garbage collected environment. Particles are usually the lightest of data containers structs with no subclassing of system objects. Then you can have complications if you are going for LargeNum of particles and decide to thread or use some logic to help the GPU side. I call this preloading and there are Level of detail groupings you can implement. Lots and lots of techniques here can confound performance. On the sending of information there are techniques like Batching. This is essentially to me the primary difference between Sprites Billboards and Particles. This means the binding of the particle data to rendering can be done with no context switching . Then there is the GPU side what shader is being run. If the shader is simply a constant color you are going to be fill rate bound. However there is a vast difference between a colorFilled particle and one that reads the back buffer samples neighbors blurs calculates light and computes a color.,gamedev,dfnrzxh,1,t5_2qi0a

Alternatively how do I rotate this vector to make it point the same direction as that other vector?  That difference is your quaternion rotation.You can combine quaternions like this    Quaternion result  quat  quatThis means start with a default orientation then rotate by quat from there and then afterward rotate your result by quat.

This is just an example but lets take your time mechanic. The player slows down time to land the object more accurately. In real life when someone is trying to be more accurate they focus on what theyre doing. So how can you visually represent focus?If you take uGamemasterAudios suggestion and add detailed backgrounds you could maybe blur those backgrounds to give the foreground objects more clarity.Next maybe you could subtly zoom in to the gap on the board. This again adds clarity to the gameplay while adding a visual flourish.Having only seen this one screen of the game and considering those changes could have strong affects on gameplay you may or may not want to include them but thinking along those lines may open up new things for you to test.,gamedev,dg24olx,3,t5_2qi0a

11584640,0,t3_65akp2,My first suggestion would be trying to land a gig in the videogame industry since you have skills at making games.The game designer gt game director gt creative director is a good line for someone who is multidisciplinary as communicating with all teams and understanding their languageconcern is quite an asset. As a onemanarmy who works in the game industry this has been the main path Ive been trying to follow so far.If you are a good programmer who understands the realities of every department a good generalist their worth its weight in gold especially if they are good both at rapid prototyping and have a good mind for making datadriven expandable systems your designers will love you if all they need to create new content is Notepad and lots of JSON files.In hindsight the one above is the one I should have pursued instead as wannabe designers are a dime a dozen actual designers are amazing but so many people go for that job because they think they have ideas that it gets hard to get your foot in the door and to get noticed.Anyway my advice is always If you are able to do a bit of everything and you dont mind doing things that people dont like then become an expert at these things. My experience says that U.I. and F.X. are the two departments that need the most love at least at Ubisoft and Electronic Arts.If your endgoal is to make your own games at home you want a day job that doesnt drain your batteries and that you dont get too invested in theres nothing worst than seeing a game of your favourite genre go wrong because of concessions debate and time constraints  Youre better off working on games of a genre you dont care about so you can go home and not lose any sleep over it. You also want to do something that you will make you grow  picking a challenging field that you think you can do will force you to learn valuable lessons that you can then leverage on your own project.TLDR You have skills at making games therefore find a job making games. Ideally pick something in high demand UI or FX in my experience. Try to land a technical job like programmer instead of a communication job like lead or designer. When you go home then release your inner designer and make your dream game.,gamedev,dg94jl1,4,t5_2qi0a

11594235,0,t3_65gyu5,Silent But DeadlyThis week was all about balance and appearance. Still needs work but some good progress nonetheless.Nerfed sneak attack  Sneak attacks used to disable enemies with just one hit but they will now only do a normal knockdown like with door slams and bottle hits where the enemy will get get back up after awhile. Punching enemies multiple times while theyre on the ground will lead to the knockout though. I also added an option to show a timer which will indicate how much longer they have until they get up.Upgradable punch  I added punch strength as an upgrade option which increases the amount of time that an enemy will stay down when punched. When maxed out you get the onehit knockout back. Although it may seem a bit pointless to remove something and then bring it right back in what this does is provide a bit of balance to it in that rather than starting out with the superpunch you must invest in it and use points for it which would have gone into other upgrades.Better character design  I finally took a shot at fleshing out the characters a little more so that they look a little more humanlike. Enemies will have a uniform to fit with the specific levels situation and other things like their skin hair style and hair color will be randomly selected. My next step with this is to allow players to customize their character to look however they want.The game is on Greenlight so any vote is appreciated. Ill most likely be redoing the trailer in order to implement these changes.Greenlight | Twitter | Gameplay Albums | Development Blog,gamedev,dga7qv6,0,t5_2qi0a

This solution is very good if you do not PLAN ahead.Second  probably more important is to know your scope. objects I mean characters items environment behaviors mostly characters behaviors but others are important too depends what kind of game you are making interactions like characters with items characters with environments and less important items with environmentsWhen you know that shit you can catch patterns and emerge groups from then.Third very important for C users.

11606201,0,t3_65lbfi,If you cater to accessibility you end up having to engage with accessibility needs on increasingly deep aspects of the design. Dwarf Fortress is the modern poster child for uncompromising gameplay with minimal affordances and it turns off a lot of people but its not exactly unsuccessful for it  its just opting into a niche by having so many of its concepts put into direct observance and control.Games that have mass appeal tend towards a design that presents a simple surface arealimited variety of interaction while suggesting at each moment that a little bit more is possible by carefully adjusting that interaction and observing the feedback as it propagates through the system in various indirect ways. This creates both accessibility and depth.Tutorials address the problem of access by putting the player through a regimented training course but this isnt the only way of teaching. Teaching has a social component of being part of a group or an ongoing conversation where the ideas flow through as a byproduct of being in that conversation. Your game can work if it has an epistemic community that supplements any ingame teaching thats one of the appealing points of obscure gameplay in fact.,gamedev,dgbkmjc,2,t5_2qi0a

11662695,0,t1_dggp33y,This is an extremely well written response  THANK YOU!  Ive managed to go through the first two links at fps and they make a lot of sense.  Ive actually got a pretty decent networking background so I definitely know the difference between TCPUDP and benefits of both.  Im completely new to gamemaking and my experience so far is with Unity and C so Im not really sure what lightweight vs featurerich libraries are.  Ive never worked with nodejs but it sounds like that should be where I go next after I finish up these classes Im taking on Unity and C.  The math behind bandwidth requirements shouldnt be a problem for me.  Im familiar with load balancers but havent done much server work  another area Ill need to work on server scaling.  I know how DNS works but Im taking a note here to look up DNSlevel traffic managers for decreasing latency.  I definitely understand your point about fireandforget as UDP doesnt require a response  its just data sent where TCP has SYNACK.  Id say I have a little bit better understanding of cloud architecture than the average Joe because its what I do in my day job.  Im network strongserver weak skillwise.Seriously thanks for such a well thought out response  Ill plow through the last two links and Im actively bookmarking material within those links to go back and read as well!I think the lag statistics are the most interesting  less than ms and the user cant really tell over ms and the game is unplayable.
