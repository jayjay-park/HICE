5353708,0,t3_3nr4eq,I was looking for One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest by Ken Kesey and spotted On The Road next to it on the bookshelf. I had heard the title before and thought the description on the back was interesting so I bought it as well as Cuckoos Nest which is probably my favorite book of all time. Since then Kerouac has been one of my favorite writers.,JackKerouac,cvvzw2s,2,t5_2vq05
