9377067,0,t3_58qdec,Actually they clearly stated in the description of the gameplay video that the games were being streamed to the prototype from the dev board with the final hardware. Its not a secret. Theyve been saying from the first day of Gamescom that their prototype was running a much weaker Intel SoC.In addition to that Smach Team from my and many others experiences have been as open and honest as they possibly could be. Theyve been listening to feedback and responding to backers comments and questions in a professional manner.One more thing the AMD SoC theyre using is w TDP which seems quite reasonable for a device with a  inch screen thats thicker than your average phone or tablet. Assuming they cool it right theyve said theyll add a fan if passive cooling doesnt go well then it may be able to get somewhat close to their goal of  hours of light gaming and yes theyve said that  hours is a GOAL and an estimation.No offense or anything but it seems like youre only accusing them of being scammers because you couldnt do the research. All the information is there and Smach Team has been very open with us.,smachz,d94lyg9,1,t5_3ar68

Configured with a W TDP the machine cant keep the GPU running anything over MHz despite drawing  watts gaming performance at best matches the Intel HD .Just because the development board probably with the APU at W TDP up and no regards for power consumption can meet the performance targets doesnt meet that the final device will be able to do it specially if its supposed to be fanless if this is not a scam they will have to shelve it until AMD releases low power ZenPolaris APUs because their current nm products are just terrible from an efficiency standpoint.,smachz,dafyepb,1,t5_3ar68

11659802,0,t3_66d1vq,Honestly looking at various articles and benchmarks on the internet there is no indication whatsoever that SteamOS runs games any faster with a few exceptions performance tends to lag behind Windows. SteamOS is basically Ubuntu which was never optimized for games unlike Windows  memory models cant say how it is now and Im no expert but e.g. Windows was historically geared more towards a small amount of processes with high needs and Unix systems prioritized more concurrent tasks and context switching and DirectX are big factors. Now then with further driver updates things may of course change  Vulkan has potential  and its certain that most developers didnt spend too much time optimizing the current Linux ports but for now Windows is generally a better gaming platform.Now then there is merit of course in having games ported to Linux in context of Smach it would mean using a much simpler interface for one using Windows sucks on keyboardless tablets and theres that freedom thing too. But I think that rather than begging developers its more effective to just buyplay more games on Linux data speaks louder than words. Good community support for those pesky nix troubles would help a lot in that respect.,smachz,dghnj48,3,t5_3ar68
