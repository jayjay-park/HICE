3027083,0,t3_2tqb7l,Wow just checked to see if there was any news on COH and found this subReddit. Thank you for sharing those screen shots. I do miss COH at times but honestly lets face it the game did not age well. Paragon did not have the resources to overhaul the game like Blizzard has for WOW over the years. I cant see COH having much time after NC Soft shuttered it. The game wouldve lasted a few more years but by now ? Theres a whole new generation playing now.That being said it was a fantastic game and I do miss my characters and flying through Paragon. I miss my super group and the awesome people I played with. However all things end and although NC Soft closed a game that had a little more life left in it I dont believe it would have made it this far. COH would be  generations behind in video game terms.It is a shame that NC Soft wouldnt put it in maintainence mode. I know Id come back to play every so often.,Cityofheroes,cobr71t,2,t5_2rsy7

6376365,0,t3_42w7es,MAN!I kept rerunning Freakolympics through Oroboros. Good Merits and the Freaks were superfun adversaries.I liked that they were dangerous enough that you had to be aware of the combat ... buuut not so dangerous that you had to like actually pay attention.When the game comes back definitely going to go Freakbusting a bunch.

6401030,0,t1_czgbefx,That can all be avoided if they simply run the servers out of France or whatever like Nostalrius does. They avoid Blizzard and thats much bigger than NCSoft. Its just frustrating at this point because CoH had a large player base and it can be emulated but people are choosing not to do it and they had to pull this fake were making a deal with NCSoft! thing instead of just getting down to business. They just need to open a server in another country and its done get on with it. Its not going to be possible for NCSoft to get cease and desists for a little private server that hosts  people in France or something. Its just too painful and too long of a process. This whole successor game thing is laughable. The stuff thats been done in like two years worth of work looks like something from an intro to programming college course I took. Just some models moving around a space with pictures pasted onto objects. I should also add companies do not care unless you are attempting to profit from their game. The people who tried to make The Sims Online asked people for  dollars dollars on PayPal to buy early access and the creator Ghst made something like  dollars or more in a few days from people paying him for something that didnt exist. He claimed he got a cease and desist and shut down the site and that he couldnt refund anyone because PayPal froze his account forever. While I think he was a lying fool that would be a case where a company would step in.,Cityofheroes,czh8d7n,2,t5_2rsy7

Dont get too enthralled by the videos any of the successors have released  its not that difficult to whip up something semifunctional to show off in a video just by using prebuilt assets purchased from a store.That said Im most looking forward to City of Titans  mainly due to the more contemporary loresetting.,Cityofheroes,dgdbih3,5,t5_2rsy7
