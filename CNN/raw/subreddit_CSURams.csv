2952187,0,t3_2tyyay,I wish them all the best. I thought for sure Hart would see that maybe going pro wasnt going to work out so well for him especially with an example like Bibbs going last year and take a graduate assistant position with McElwain or even Bobo. I hope he absolutely crushes the combine though.,CSURams,co3oeet,1,t5_2ziut

5679245,0,t3_3sv212,The game was more high scoring than I thought it would be however it still played out like expected. New Mexico on the other hand thats going to be a slug fest. Theyve taken down both Utah State and Boise State  holding them both to far few points than they typically average.  points less than average in the case of Boise  points below their average against Utah State. Hopefully the Rams can repeat this offensive performance and hang some points on New Mexico. Theyre not a high scoring team slightly worst than UNLV at  ppg on average. The good news is that New Mexico is incredibly one dimensional just like Air Force. Then again San Diego State has a similar profile and ran all over us at home. If theres a repeat performance by the CSU team that showed up against Air Force we should be able to walk away with a good win. Well see though I predict its going to be a tough game. ,CSURams,cx12ep3,2,t5_2ziut

As a  hes likely to start for  or  years and get an opportunity to develop and be noticed. Thats not something hed get at an SEC school.Also to add If youre going to go to a G team the one with a new  million dollar stadium and that iswas being considered by P conferences is great. Were in a really great position to offer  and  star players an opportunity. ,CSURams,d949112,3,t5_2ziut

10065842,0,t3_5jx1le,UGACSU fan here Give it another year guys. This one is on the coaching staff and the equipment manager because it was quite obvious that a change of cleats was made during halftime. However Bobo is recruiting his ass off and the  class is gonna be a shot in the arm. I can tell you from experience with being a fan of an SEC team that it is more about the Jimmy and Joes than the Xs and Os. Go RAMS and GO DAWGS!!!P.S. Id fire that equipment manager as soon as the holidays are over if I were Bobo.,CSURams,dbjlp3l,11,t5_2ziut
