8979,0,t3_1u73to,Thoughts from an outsider You guys need to tighten up your communication youre either open or not.  And both people need to acknowledge that is the case... no hints. To me special rules based on gender are not cool.  Youre only allowed to date women?  Then he should only be allowed to date men.  It is total bullshit that he gets cross gender dating and you dont.   Everyone has their own rules but is making out really cheating?  Esp if youre open to begin with?  To me not worth breaking up over IMHO. My partner is super sensitive to being humiliated i.e. other people finding out and thinking shes being cheated on.  My gut here says the real issue is that his coworker saw you... it puts him in an awkward place and depending on the org he works for could put his career in jeopardy I work for a very conservative company and this is definitely the case for me.Sounds like you have a lot to talk about.  After you sort things out know what I would recommend?  A contract.  Write everything out the rules whats cool whats not.  And both of you sign it.  When you break the contract thats now cheating.,nonmonogamy,cefghy2,19,t5_2rc24
19077,0,t1_cegk3g9,We have talked about nonmonogamy and they both said they are committed to what we have going on. They both said they feel more comfortable with the other woman being there that way they dont have to wonder if I will want to go off with the other. It gives them more security this way. If anything it seems more of a struggle to see which one will like run the household or who the Alpha female will be for lack of a better term. Other than that we do a lot of things together the get along most of the time it is petty things that they argue about. And both of them said they are not interested in dating anyone else so I havent even thought about the possibility of them dating anyone else. The discussions we are having is starting a family and both woman want to get pregnant which is another bridge I am not sure we are ready to cross. Do I do that without getting married to either?

2746355,0,t1_cnex3kf,Also you may want to consider that the question to get to before the question of sleeping with others is Why are we together?  The first answer is almost never so that we have someone to have sex with exclusively.If you explore why you are really staying together sexual exclusivity is probably way down on the list and it may not come up at all. Noticing the fact that when you consider the reasons you stay with your partner are deeper than mere sexual exclusivity leads to the question of whether sexual and even emotional exclusivity is really essential to your love for each other. Find the basis for why you really love your partner and communicate that. Explore the fact that there are deep reasons for your love that have nothing to do with sex and exclusivity.  Build your mutual trust in that.  Do that first and the question of whether you ever fantasize about sex with others is much less of a hurdle. ,nonmonogamy,cng8z6j,3,t5_2rc24

2988475,0,t1_co7qddw,Well I think everyone has to own all of their choices. Intention is the way we do life and the only thing we can measure ourselves by really. And were not helpless we do shape our identities by active choice a great deal of the time. The distinction is I think that some choices are less optional than others and sexual choices are very important to us so we tend to make them core components of our identity. I hesitate to draw the analogy too far but a clearly hetero or gay person will typically incorporate that into their core identity and most will never question it why not the same logic for a NM person? Both cases determine what sexual partners you are drawn to. One observation though its often the monogamous people who strongly identify the well I guess some people can enjoy that but never me because I just am monogamous is a thing Ive heard very often.All I know is I tried being mono for decades and all it made me was unhappy.

As for what to do about it all that wasnt really the nature of this post. I need to stop having fun cut it out with the unethical behavior before anything beyond the online realm occurs let the lust pass and just deal with the libido mismatch. Im going to have to accept that there are things and people and experiences I will not have. Thats just life. I dont think he needs to know. I just think it needs to stop and not happen again. As far as the gender affecting him he would be  never okay with another man. He would be threatened by it because he would be worried that someone else might be a better lover than him. He would at least in theory consider another woman and would not be threatened because as he put it that is an experience that he cannot give me. His view is that he can give me man but he cannot give me woman so thats why he might be okay with a woman. Honestly though hes just overwhelmed with my sex drive and thinks Im letting sex rule my life and that its just not that important.

3850669,0,t3_34i1r7,I will offer a differing opinion and say that it is worth exploring. Sure having a stable healthy relationship as a foundation makes things easier but I dont believe your situation precludes you from trying this. Clearly you are not happy in your current relationship so IMO its not like you have alot to lose by at least discussing this option. Its not as if you have a  year marriage and kids to think about. You are young enough that its wiser to hash things out now than just keep hoping theyll get better. Remember the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over while expecting a different result.  Me and my husband opened up last year and we had some similar themes in our relationship. I wouldnt say he had mental health issues but he tends to be moodypessimistic and when he is dissatisfied with life will start to resent me a little bit for trapping him into domestic life which I did nothing of the sort its what he has chosen. Opening up our relationship has allowed him to feel more free and appreciate me more. It has not solved all our problems by any means  he can still be quite the negative nancy complaining that hes tired and doesnt have time for all his dates  what a problem to have! but its definitely taken some pressure off our relationship. I would caution you against bringing up this other person until much later into your discussion process. Keep everything abstract and focus on benefits for both of you and your relationship. Be patient and if you lose this guys interest there will be plenty more once you are putting yourself out there. ,nonmonogamy,cqv7mc6,2,t5_2rc24

Even if condoms are much more effective it doesnt have the I did it myself and I control it peace of mind of a diaphragm. Its also not liable to break or have random risks in construction its effectiveness is related to its positioning which with practice would be reproduceable. It can also be put in a few hours before sex allowing more of that spontaneous escalation of activities without needing to stop for condoms. In the getting used to the fit stage Id suggest combining a diaphragm with condoms andor a calendar method only try the diaphragm without condoms well away from estimated fertile times.Understandably her partners will probably not agree on that I did it peace of mind.Scarleteen offers more info ,nonmonogamy,ct33jmc,1,t5_2rc24

4642161,0,t3_3ejm7r,You have to be super clear on boundaries and expectations. People are comfortable or uncomfortable with a wide variety of arrangements and the biggest mistake you guys can make is to assume ANYTHING regarding what each other would be ok with. For example some people want to know every detail of who their partner is with and what they do together. They find comfort in knowledge and total honesty. Others want to know nothing. Their time together is just for them and they might even find it disrespectful to hear their partner talking about this other guygirl theyre seeing. Theres also the possibility and even inevitability that these rules will change and shift over time. This is why consistent open communication is so vital.  If that strong trust and communication is there as you say youll be ok. That doesnt mean youre guaranteed to still be together in  years time. Of course neither does being in a mono situation either! Youre giving each other the gift of freedom to fully live your lives and experience everything you both want and need. Keep that perspective in mind as much as possible. Thats the essence of true love and partnership difficult as it can and will be at times. ,nonmonogamy,ctfpl8x,4,t5_2rc24
4660619,0,t3_3ef9a9,The thing about boundaries is they will differ for every party because they are based on our unique needs as individuals. They will also change over time as our current emotionalmental wellbeing changes. When identifying your own boundaries the important part is that both parties understand the reasoning behind these boundaries.Can you explain why you think each of your boundaries are necessary for you? Can you envision how and why you might become upset if your partner disrespected these boundaries? Can you verbalize your boundaries in a sentence like this I need my partner to do  because if not I will feel  . If not you need to reflect and think about that first and modify your boundaries as necessary.Here are some of the boundaries with rationale w me and my partner for examples. I need my partner to inform me about their attraction to someone before doing anything sexual with them because if not I feel like they would rather keep a secret than risk me vetoing a hookup which makes me feel like my boundaries are not being respected. I need my partner to refrain from flirting andor going home with other people if we go out together and I dont have any other friends an escape route to hang out with because if not I feel abandoned and left out and I feel like they are not respecting my desire to have enough time to mentally prepare for a new metamour. I need my partner to use protection when having penetrative sex and to get tested every three months because if not I feel like they are endangering our mutual health because we do not use protection together and I feel like it is disrespectful to my own concern for my health.,nonmonogamy,cti1021,1,t5_2rc24

4968421,0,t1_cuk9plm,Thanks for the compliment haha I like to think we have good communication in our relationship. As far as him I think my fear is partially the idea that she wants something that I cannot physically give her and just the general idea of her being attracted to someone else to the point that she would like to explore her feelings. Not only is this the first time she has asked to do this its also the first time shes wanted to do this with a guy. So it was kind of a double whammy for me.

5105388,0,t3_3kxrtc,I think nonmonogamy aftercare is a serious thing. It used to be a total requirement that we have sex that night or the next but sometimes I felt like it was a sort of jealousy for me that I wanted to reclaim him after he had sex with someone else. Over time its become much less important for me but I still like having intimate cuddlingsex time with my primary after one of us has been with another partner. Weve also recently started a new relationship in which my primary and I are dating the same person but not primary with her. Sometimes it feels a little draining still if we spent the whole weekend with her that we never got any us time. I think its just something were working out and adjusting to. ,nonmonogamy,cv1e1f1,14,t5_2rc24

5128593,0,t1_cv2kym7,Answer The same good communication habits that apply to any relationship problem apply here as well. In talking about the violation try to avoid sentences that focus exclusively on the other person You did x or You always do y or You made me feel z. Instead try language like Based on our agreement I expected x or When you do y I feel z. Good communication will help you pinpoint what rule was broken and how.Next its important that the person who broke the rule accepts responsibility for it and sincerely apologizes. That lays the groundwork for forgiveness. Together you can decide how your partners behavior or the rules or both should change.Sometimes a partner breaks a rule because theres a difference in assumptions or definitions. Words like date sleepover and sex can entail different things to different people. To get over a violation it can be helpful to further define any rules to help ensure that it doesnt happen again.It can also be helpful to evaluate whether the rules as they stand really help meet the underlying goal whether theyre practical or whether the rules themselves are setting you up for failure.,nonmonogamy,cv46rkl,2,t5_2rc24

There is nothing wrong with you and humans run the gamut of libido and relationship needs. Couples deal with this sort of problem all the time and many fail to.

6104279,0,t3_3z5ifv,It sounds like you guys are off to a good start. I am curious though about the no multiple times rule and I think you both should discuss that further the reasons and fears behind that and if that can be renegotiated if one of you finds someone you want to fuck again. For him especially if he finds a fun girl to play with who isnt full of drama and is comfortable with your situation he may want to have a fwb sort of thing with her. Its almost always harder for guys to find partners in this lifestyle unfortunately. Especially if the rules dictate that he has to find a new partner every time. Also.... feels.... they can happen. Youre both only human and humans are ridiculously good at developing feels rules be damned even if you only fuck once. You should talk openly about what to do in the event of that hint no blaming guilt tripping shaming etc. Be empathetic. Realize it doesnt have to be a threat to your relationship. The key will be to COMMUNICATE. About everything. Especially things that may seem scary or uncomfortable to talk about. Just do it. ,nonmonogamy,cyjhsxc,6,t5_2rc24

8563199,0,t1_d6a9n0f,Thank you avapoet! Your advice is excellent and I greatly appreciate you taking time to write me such a lengthy response. What you said about adultery and the Bible floats right around what I have been thinking. Since he and his wife have agreed to this it is consensual and not adultery if we consider adultery cheating. It is a struggle to separate what is simply Christian rhetoric that has been passed down for centuries and what is actually clearly stated in the Bible i.e. adultery premarital sex drinking etc. But you are absolutely right this is about my relationship with God and I have to figure it or for myself. I definitely agree that we learn based on experiences. I believe that maturity and knowledge are not  age related but come from experience and your ability to learn from those experiences. Ive known some extremely mature young people and some highly immature older people. I believe in living life to the fullest and experiencing as many in a safe way experiences as I can. I may decide that this sort of relationship is not for me or that Im not built for it but I will gain an abundance of knowledge and experience that I can take into future relationships.Youre right about there not being a handbook for this. I cant treat this like a normal relationship because there is no rule book which is intriguing to me and have to figure everything out in new ways. Ive been reading a lot of articles and then I made this post to gain more information. I dont want to be his number one girl. I am happy to simply be his friend get to know him at a deeper level and be physical once in a while. However I struggle with the fact that I am not the only girl and so he has to divvy up his time. Im used to having a guy when in a relationship that I can talk to anytime. Now I cant. If he is spending time with his wife or girlfriend I leave them alone. However for a week and a half we talked nonstop yay NRE and now for the last week we have barely talked at all. It was a rough switch at first but I realized that time management on his part is a must. I accepted that. Then two days ago he had some drama with his girlfriend. I realized that he was hurting and needed space so I am giving that to him. But Ive been telling him that I need to talk for a week now and we havent done it. Im trying to be a good person and give him time and space. But because he chose to have  relationships I feel like he needs to at least give me a little something. In college if you have a difficult course you might focus on it more than others. But at the same time a good student wont neglect the other classes you might just spend a little less time.

8591629,0,t3_4xeqoq,Not to sound like a cranky unicorn asshole but youll be fighting the stigma of being unicorn hunters your entire journey. I have been burned by so many couples who had great relationships and fought for equality that no rosetinted glasses tale is going to get me anymore. I just dont fucking buy it.When I first read this post I mentally sighed oh great another clueless couple. After rereading the post I realized you were a little more selfaware than the typical unicorn hunters... At least youre aware of the stigma. But that doesnt change the fact that youre still unicorn hunting. You guys sound like the archetype of the couple that has actively fucked me over time and time again. I see in your story a repeated mistake that I wont be making again.What infuriates me and other single poly bisexual women is that were commodified. You guys will get into a triad eventually realize its hard and your third will get fucked over...... Or at least thats what me and all of the other unicorns you come across will think. You dont want to be considered just another unicorn hunting couple?? Well spoiler every unicorn hunting couple says that. So what would I go for? A couple who is seasoned in poly has dated people separately and lets a triad evolve naturally. Instead of trying to jam a unicorn into a hole you created you let her pick out the shape she fits best into.,nonmonogamy,d6fjl70,3,t5_2rc24

10187561,0,t3_5lskz9,Part of coping with anxiety involves living with and in the anxiety and seeing it through to the other side knowing you will survive it.Your husband may have to do this. He may have to sit with his fear that you will leave him. You can comfort him and reassure him but he has to learn how to cope and deal with that fear and learn that hell survive it and that you will be there for him.No amount of consoling you can do at this point is going to change the amount of anxiety hes going to have to process. And he can logically tell himself all he wants you wont leave that wont change his fear. And you both need to accept that hes going to have this fear and weather through it.You probably WERE afraid when he did go out and do things and leave you on your own. I think generally speaking women are expected to do their own emotional labour to not burden men with their emotions because they are always told they are clingy. Whereas men dont have that problem when sharing their fears.Regardless hes got to sit through it and realise you wont leave him.If your partner has anxiety or had experience with abusive parents or a toxic household these things might help  ways toxic parenting impacted your nonmonogamy  things I wish Id learned before choosing nonmonogamy What anxiety taught me about nonmonogamy A relationship is not a skill Nonmonogamy and fear Compersion is not compulsory,nonmonogamy,dbyteek,6,t5_2rc24

10263381,0,t1_dc6x3hy,So I found your comment extremely helpful. I guess Im at this point now where a sort of calm has set in. Im less worried about how things will happen... just what happens afterward. And the more people are advising me to date separately the more I realized that I dont actually want to. I think its forced me evaluate what I want out of opening up our relationship. I want my husband to be able to experience these new things but I dont necessarily want to start dating other people as a result. It feels like were leaning more towards having a third than just having separate FWB. I realize this is the elusive unicorn that everyone keeps talking about but I guess Im.... willing to wait? I think my husband is too.However I fully understand and anticipate the possibility that my husband might find someone who is solely interested in him before then. I will do my best to be okay with that fact... and start working through the shifting dynamics of our relationship with him. I really found thisgt  they are a whole person that I love and I love every aspect of themto be the most helpful. Just last night I said to my SO that Im not enough because he has needs outside of what I can provide. But I think this needs to become my mantra I am enough because he loves me as a whole. I give him everything that I can offer and it is enough for him. Thank you again. ,nonmonogamy,dc7eruw,1,t5_2rc24

10831627,0,t3_5us1o9,I can totally see things from your partners perspective. I see my friend with benefits about twice a month for sex and we sometimes cross paths at social events with other friends. I like him a lot as a friend and appreciate him and his qualities. But Im not in love with him and I dont anticipate that ever changing because I just dont feel that way about him. There are things that make us pretty incompatible as romantic or life partners. I can overlook those incompatibilities because thats not what he or I are trying to get out of a relationship with one another and the frequency with which we see each other is such that our idiosyncrasies feel charming and not irritating to each other. I am confident that were on the same page with where we are so Im not worried that he is using me or I am using him or that either of us is taking advantage of the other. Its a nicely balanced thing. Hes just not the type of person I would fall for but nevertheless I really enjoy our relationship.I think you are projecting your experiences of what it takes for you to want to be naked and sexual around someone onto herthem. I used to feel the same before I started dating others in this casual way. When I was in a more mono mindset and I was casually dating I was still at some level seeking out a romantic connection even if I didnt feel that motivated to have a more serious relationship. Im not sure I ever had a proper friendswithbenefits set up before I met my life partner. Now when I date others there is so much less pressure on them to be all the things to me that I feel I can pick and choose the qualities I want. I have a deeply loving and romantic connection with my primary and I dont feel I want anything more in this area so now I focus on other attributes that Im more interested in intellectual compatibility sexual chemistry an independent attitude and so on. If I were dating people that were like my partner then sure I might catch feels at some point but I dont. I date people who are really different from my partner who are different to the type of person I would date if I were looking for romance and it just works. I dont have any rules and my primary could deal with it if feelings emerged Im sure but they havent and thats because Im more interested in nonromantic relationships right now.,nonmonogamy,ddx7ff7,7,t5_2rc24

She could have reflected on that guilt and learned from it all the while sparing his feelings by not burdening him with the knowledge that his love is willing to make other people feel tingly in a way that she is not willing to do for him.

11764269,0,t1_dgtd7gn,gt I am not doing anything bad no point in hiding.Im not telling you that you need to hide anything but youre argument if applied generally is the exact same arguement that people make when it comes to corporate and government spying... even to hacking when people say it doesnt matter i have nothing to hide..Privacy in that context is not about having anything to hide.   Which is a much larger argument. Specifically to this case you take someone like me.  Right?   Ive been in a physical altercation with my father and was disowned from them for years because a crazy ex showed proof to them about some bicurious things I expressed on a message board one time. The only reason we reconciled is because my mother got diagnosed with cancer and didnt want to die not speaking to me.My family is backwards.  Religous zealots bigots Trump voters Fox News addicts. My father is an exKlansmen.  They fly a confederate flag from their porch.  If they were strangers Id hate them... and needless to say i have issues lots of issues with them both in their moralsvaluespolitics and issues far more personal.But they are my parents.They sacrificed their entire lives to my siblings and I would turn out better than they did and we did..  They defended us when someone wronged us they were there for us when we were down.  Even though Im in my mid s and they are retired I can call them and ask them to help with ANYTHING at any time.    I largely because of some of their misconceptions about parenting was hell as a teenager.  I was awful.  I backtalked i cursed i destroyed their shit i threatened to kill myself and self harmed just to hurt them i broke every rule in the book x over and while their methods for dealing with me were wrong and ignorant and counterproductive... they never not fucking once gave up on me.   While they didnt show interest in  my interests when it deviated from theirs my father coached sports teams i was on.  They never missed a game.   They stayed involved with my schooling got me tutors when they were incapable of helping me further. I have family friends who are just like my parents. I work with nice people in a right to work state that are similar.I dont think Im doing anything wrong.   BUT THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES TO MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH PEOPLE WHO DO NOT THINK THAT WAYThis is so much a hard truth in my life  that when i was almost raped by another man it didnt even enter my mind to tell the authorities. I just lived with it. And Im not alone in this. This isnt some fucking uncommon thing.  The grand majority of the population in the US was raised religious in some form or another.  This is even more true globally.Think about Christians Muslims and Hindi the Middle East Africa and Asia who could suffer death or imprisonment for being polyamorous or for being gay.Do they have anything to hide? Are they doing anything wrong? Fuck no.Its not them that are doing anything wrong  its the world and the environment around them that disagrees.This expectation that everyone who acts a certain way needs to fall on their sword for the cause is fucking trash.I really dont understand why people in these subs are so fucking dense about the general reality outside of your little fucking NICHE bubbles.And anyone who tells me i got nothing to hide bravely on the internet.. man.  Id love to look over your shoulder for about  weeks. I promise you i could find something you said or did in one circle or moment of privacy that could harm you if exposed in others.  Everyone is so fucking full of shit with their invincibility complexes and false sense of security.Im not about to wear the fact that my wife has extramarital affairs both with and without me and that I enjoy it to anyone other than the people were bringing in the bedroom or strangers online.  The first thing people around me would attempt to do is try to get custody of my child thinking the environment we created was unsafe even though our child is never exposed to it . It would destroy relationships that I dont want destroyed it would disappoint people who dont need to be disappointed in me before they die.,nonmonogamy,dgtico9,1,t5_2rc24
