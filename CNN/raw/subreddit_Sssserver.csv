5861059,0,t1_cxnsihs,I really liked the ZI batteries too. Will work great together with NuclearCraft.BC quarries was disabled because I wanted people to use Ender Quarry instead. Theres several reasons. Main reason from a lag perspective is that EnderQuarry will stop outputting items if it has nowhere to send it while BC quarry spits items everywhere. This happen a lot since newer players allways go for BC quarry over ender quarry. Ive never seen the liquids in bc quarries as a big issue we had these all the time before EnderQuarry was a thing. Another reason is of course that ender quarries can be used anywhere since it leaves a nice grassy area instead of a giant eyesore. Downside is obviously that mining world is covered in grass so it makes it impossible to see where someone has used an ender quarry So marking the area is very important. ,Sssserver,cxnwxab,1,t5_2sg8t
