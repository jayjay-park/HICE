The fact that she couldnt beat as nodt and the fact that she has bankai are contradictory per kubos own rules about obtaining bankai.

Thats why he was able to overpower her and thats why he began to shackle himself out of fear of never finding another worthy opponent.Using your interpretation he started shackling himself but somehow hes grown closer with his Zan despite the fact that his walls as you called them stopped him from communicating with his Zan.  So when Unohana helps him break down those walls all the sudden his relationship with his Zan is more advanced than it was when he had all his walls up?!?  Nope sorry cant buy it cuz its not logical.Im sorry if my use of profanity bothers you.  Considering were talking Zaraki here I thought the occasional F bomb was the proper homage.  Either way your interpretation of the fight sequence doesnt hold up.  Not to mention how can you explain the single panel appearance of the th Kenpachi?

He could even kill himself if he thought we was too weak to draw in oxygen or whatever SR breath.The only way to make himself the strongest he could be is to adamantly believe he is the strongest thing since sliced bread.

Nero panicked and kicked off the blade in order to get away so that he could better analyze the situation but he hadnt looked to see what the chain was attached to let alone what was in Hisagis right hand. As soon as he landed he had to lean back like he was going under a limbo beam in order to dodge the attack but he wasnt fast enough his nose was scraped and his hair was shortened. Before he could complain he noticed the other scythe spinning towards him in his current position he knew that if he tried to block the attack he would be knocked over leaving his back open for yet another attack. He jumped and span over the attack he knew if didnt counterattack then he would be on the defensive until he died. He took two shots at Hisagi and threw his blade at him with his demonic arm.Nero pulled himself the blade that became fixed in a wall behind Hisagis head he holstered his gun in midair and grabbed hisagi by the face pulling him to the wall behind them. Hisagi dropped Kazeshini and caught the chain hooking the two sides together with his feet. He shouted Hado number one sho as he put his hands behind him. This allowed him to cushion the hit he flipped and keeping in mind that Kazeshini was still locked between his feet. Locked eyes with Nero and  said Bakudo number  Restrain Neros arms were locked behind his back before he had the chance to swing his sword that he just pulled out of the wall at Hisagi. Hado number one sho said hisagi as he kicked the chain from Kazeshini back into his hands.Ha you think this will hold me? asked Nero as he turned around to see the sharp side of Kazeshini towards him. Shit shit shit shit shit shouted Nero.Sorry kid said Hisagi. He turned around and waited for the dark sound of flesh ripping but he wasnt gifted with the sad gratification he heard yet another clang of metal meeting metal but this one was clearly a different sword Hisagi could tell by the clang of metal. Kid next time I tell you to keep your stupid ass inside keep your stupid ass inside or you may lose your fucking head Shouted Dante who was bleeding profusely with as he blocked kazeshini  Here for the rest of this fight you will need this. He handed him Vergils sword. Then turned around.So this is where you ran off to? Were you distracted with the thought of this kid dying instead of focusing on me? asked Kenpachi as he walked towards Dante he was bleeding from his nonsword hand from cuts and bullet wounds.

Im not looking to connect that number again just showing its been used before for deeper meanings. The clock tower had some important panels during the swap from Sereitei when Bach took over and IMO clearly symbolizes the VR and its  upper hand in the war.

1367075,0,t1_cinm0pq,Ginjou does something very interesting just before taking Ichigos Fullbring.  It looks like he merges his substitute badge with Cross of Scaffold.  So far as Im aware he doesnt unmerge it from that point on.My guess is that this possibly combined with taking Ichigos Fullbring is what allows him to use what hes calling Bankai.  The odd thing is that he also manifests darksciera Hollow hybrid qualities.  He explains this via the Hollow reiatsu responsible for Fullbring.Hes also using Ichigos reiatsu and through it Ichigos techniques.  Ichigo had Bankai  but what he had was also based on his Hollowascendant zanpakuto.  Reiatsu memories can awaken abilities.  Ichigos reiatsu contains Hollow qualities and remembers Bankai and his Hollow nature.  Ginjou was a former Shinigami  its possible that he had a Bankai of his own though I doubt it was Hollowbased or displayed the Hollowlike qualities that this particular manifestation does.I suspect that what Ginjou called Bankai was just a memory resonating with his and Ichigos Fullbring and possibly the sealed reiatsu within his badge.  Notice that he didnt really show any new abilities  his outfit looked like a crossmerge of Ichigos Fullbring and the fur bitsdark sciera of Ichigos H form.  Cross of Scaffold also changed to become more ornate.  Its hard to get a read on exactly how powerful he was in this form though since it was Ichigos repowering debut and as such by the laws of Shounen he needed to lay the smack down.,bleach,cinnh2v,2,t5_2rk7q

With your limitless literature skills and my visionary leadership we will bring about a new age into earth and we will breathe new life into the cosmos.

1943240,0,t1_cknbop7,Great comment youve clearly put some thought into this. I agree with most of what youre saying so forgive me for pecking at it...gtWhen he left soul society it was like leaving a whole other life behind for a new one.I think I get what you mean by that not  sure. If you mean something like the past is the past then I am forced to disagree. In TBTP we are specifically shown his attitude about the situation and it seems to be more or less No time to waste shit just got serious and I am perfectly capable of dealing with it. Weve been shown plenty to suggest that he has dedicated his life to being in control of the fate of SS. He physically left SS but his interest never did.gtI wouldnt say hes a different person now but hes certainly the type to think that hes got a good thing going for him with the candy shop and he isnt gonna leave that behind.Im assuming you dont mean the candy shop specifically since Urahara seems to be a man who concerns himself with big thingsideas a pioneer who breaks the mold rarely accepting realities as they are and instead paving the way for the realities he desires. An inventor is never content with the current state of affairs an inventor seeks out solutions to problems. A life as a candy shop owner doesnt fit his nature... but that is of course simply a cover for his actual purposeexistance.Im assuming you mean that he is content with his situation in that he gets to continue inventing that that wasnt interrupted. While I can agree with that he would be grateful that he got to continue doing his thing... I see no reason to extend it to say that he wouldnt want to leave it behind. Really that premise is fallacious  it assumes hed have to give up that situation rather than improve it. Why would that be presumed?gtThere was some change in soul society thanks to ichigo yes but we havent had confirmation that theyve ended practices like dealing with deviants they certainly havent turned over enough of a new leaf as to help people find their families after death or as to bring people in the outer districts at least the children out of poverty. Thats really a stretch. Those are all situations that havent been driven into the light. No reason to expect that they would have suddenly had a massive evil policies audit that dredged out all of SSs problems and required them be changed.You cant disentangle Urahara from those solved vizardichigo problems. It was a package. Uraharas redemption was specifically ignored. Its not like he could be overlooked either... he got the headshot to beat Aizen.If he IS the true villain... then it makes sense not to show that his issues with SS were resolved.Sure its possible for SS not to give him closure. But its extremely suspicious when you consider that they were shown to give closure to every other person involved in the fiasco. And yet Urahara the one who actually saved the day who stopped the person who committed the crimes he was blamed for... is just ignored?,bleach,cknd0fu,1,t5_2rk7q

2056658,0,t3_2icym0,Also a theory if we were to go on the assumption that this theory is correct and that the Hogyoku is indeed just like creating an Assauchi then we should also assume that the coincidence of Ichigo and Rukia in the beginning wasnt a coincidence at all Urahara and Aizen had been working together from the very beginning although the same goal approached it at odds in a different angle therefore the reason they opposed each other and the reason why Aizen had put his and Uraharas versionsdifferent Hogyokus together meaning that the Hogyoku could not identify itself with anybody until it met with Ichigo. If Assauchi are made from a part of the shinigami that they dislikereject then it only made sense for them to have the Hogyoku around Ichigo because they couldnt themselves be the ones to convert the Hogyoku they just couldnt bring out its potential. Basically the simplest way to put this is that they didnt really hate or maybe they didnt see the point in purely hating either shinigami or hollows so in order for the Hogyoku to begin taking its shape they had to let a human hybrid like Ichigo form their own views and values of both sides where the Hogyoku could then take shape as that of what Ichigo dislikedrejected about himself to become that part of Ichigo.Ichigo has yet to accept those sides of himself that he dislikedrejected so the Hogyoku is merely in a hibernation period which can explain the reason Aizens zanpakuto began to dissolve it had begun to understand what exactly it is that Ichigo dislikedrejected.Since Urahara and Aizen most likely could not bring themselves to truly dislikereject something about either hollow or shinigami they had Ichigo do that for them because they Urahara and Aizen simply more than anything wanted to know more about hollowsshinigami andor if a humanshinigamiquincy hybrid could bring out the true goal of creating the Hogyoku in the first place.rant sorry if it makes no sense. p,bleach,cl18vq4,3,t5_2rk7q

2136619,0,t1_clbeao1,Honestly Id say its debatable but at the end of the day it really isnt. Superboy prime or regular Superman for that matter is too fast for the Hulk. Yes people in the marvel universe frequently comment about how surprisingly fast the Hulk is but at the end of the day for SupermanSuperboymost of the DC heavy hitters itd be like fighting an incredibly tough statue. Not to mention Hulk would have to reach the same peaks of powerrage he has before World Breaker to even begin to get into the same strength class as SupermanSuperboy Prime. Hulks strength has no limit but he does have a baseline and needs time and a big enough reason to get angrier than he ever has before hed start to enter the strength range to really put on a fight against Superman and Superboy Prime is just that much stronger still. And as a Hulk fan that hurts but I cant let my bias get in the way of reasoning. Thor is also literally a god in the Marvel sense. Unless you meant omnipotent in which case Odin is not. Odin is more like a middleground between the characters like ThorHulk and the greater cosmic beings like Galactus the Celestials Eternity and the big daddy of them all the Living Tribunal the judge of the entirety of the multiverse.

2192095,0,t3_2k644e,Yhwach specifically tells Yama that anyone could have stolen his Bankai but that he instructed them not to because only he could control it.Theres a couple theories as to the reason for Ichigos immunity.  The simplest is that ZangetsuHichigos Hollow reiatsu is incompatible and thus rejected by the medallions.My more complex and harder to justify theory is based on Ichigos state after FGT and the apparent mechanics of the medallions.We havent been explicitly told how the medallions work but we can infer a few things from what the Sternritter and Shinigami say.  It appears that they act as a sort of man in the middle attack against the Zanpakuto spirit itself.  When stolen the Shinigami can no longer communicate with the spirit See Hitsugaya.  When Urahara distributes the Hollowification pills the connection between the QuincyMedallion and the Zanpakuto spirit is interrupted See BG and the Shinigami is once again able to communicate with the spirit See Hitsugaya again.  Some residual connection with the Quincy is left Cang Du sees Hyorinmarus dragon form.  If the Shinigami is killed the Zanpakuto spirit is apparently contained in the medallion Driscoll.Ichigos state is a little more difficult to pinpoint since the full spiritual mechanics of FGTs burnout effect arent known.  Theres a finality to Tensa Hichigetsus attitude towards it and while Ichigos powers are jumpstarted by the reiatsu sword we dont see or hear a peep from OMZ or ZangetsuHichigo from that time until the forging.  That seems...weird to me.  Too weird to be coincidental.Theres also the form of Ichigos Shikai and Bankai after being jumpstarted.  The Shikai blade looks just like a larger guardless version of Yhwachs sword.  The Bankai blade looks just like Whites swordarms.  The blade is brittle and easily broken by Haschwald.  My theory is that this isnt Zangetsu  its a memory.Ichigos entire powerset appears to be based on soul memory.  His own Shinigami powers were awakened by being exposed to Rukias.  After he was cut off from Rukias borrowed powers by Byakuya his soul remembered his fathers Shinigami abilities which caused his latent powers to activate though he needed the impetus of the shaft to draw them out.His Quincy powers are awakened in almost exactly the same way after he expends himself in Quirges jail.  Like a sponge his reiatsuempty body absorbs some from his environment. The Quincy reiatsu in the cage reacts with Ichigos souls memory of his mothers Quincy powers and awakens his own.If and this is kindof a big if we assume that Ichigo lost OMZ and ZangetsuHichigo to FGT  that they no longer existed within his soul at all  we can chart how he gets his powers back and the puzzle pieces fit Fullbring restrengthens his soul The reiatsu sword jumpstarts his reiatsu engine Quincy reiatsu from Quirges jail activates his latent Quincy abilities OMZ can appear Ichigo learns of his origins and White allowing him to create a fresh imprint on a proper Asauchi. Oetsu forges the newlyimprinted Asauchi into NewZangetsu.  Ichigo inserts OMZ into it during the forging process creating the second blade. OMZ and NewHichigo manifest over the bladesIf Im right then at the time Ivan and Quirge attempt to steal Ichigos Bankai the effect fizzled because there was laterally nothing to steal.  What he was using wasnt a real Bankai but rather the memory of one.  This also explains why neither OMZ nor Hichigo made contact with Ichigo during the intervening time between the reiatsu sword and the forging.  They werent there.This is all based on conjecture of course but I havent seen anything that contradicts it yet.  Occams Razor would certainly suggest Im wrong since the medallionimmunity can be explained more simply by Ichigos Hollow abilities.  It doesnt cover the odd silence of Ichigos spirits though which is the core of what bothers me about that interval.,bleach,cligvzj,3,t5_2rk7q

2653621,0,t1_cn4y2u7,I really dont want to get into a shipping war here but I do need to point a few things out... First off have you forgotten that Orihime and Ichigo barely even talked to each other before Rukia showed up? In fact she used to be scared of him...gt The two of them Ichigo and Rukia truly didnt have much of a relationship but grew as friends and the obligation of her saving his life is what I really believe drove him to save her.Um...Im gonna have to disagree a lot there. Rukia is stated many times to be the person who changed Ichigos world. In fact I think Orihime herself has stated that Rukia is the most important person to him. gt They Orihime and Ichigo were far closer than friends.Yeah....thats not true at all..Ichigo and Rukias relationship is the most significant and deepest relationship Ichigo has in the series. More so than any other characters relationship with Ichigo. Over a period of a few weeks they came to trust each other with their lives. He even shared his guilt over his mothers death with Rukia something hes never told anyone besides her. Their relationship is to the point where they dont even have to speak to each other to understand what the other is thinkingfeeling. Plus Kubo himself has described Rukia as and I quote Ichigos light. That is beyond debate as Rukia really is the light that drives Ichigo forward. No one else but Rukia can get Ichigo out of his own depression and move forward. The prime example of this is at the beginning of the Arrancar arc. Orihime herself even realizes this.gt Rukia eventually reaches this type of relationship incredibly soon but this die for each other relationship builds on a prior relationship that involved a mild sexual tensionhuge knockers. No...just no. Rukia reached the would die for each other relationship in the first arc almost immediately. Orihime it took much longer. Also Ichigo has never not once shown any sexual interest in Orihime. He is completely disinterested. There is little to no sexual tension between them. Only Keigo Kon and Chizoru express any interest towards Orihime sexually. The only time that could even possibly suggest that is when hes embarrassed by her new outfit because he thinks shes showing off too much in the current arc. Even then that doesnt really count because if Ichigo being embarrassed at a girl showing off too much equals love then he is also in love with Yoruichi due to when she transformed and was naked in front of him. Also by that logic then he is in love with Rangiku from when she attempts to bribe him by flashing him so she can stay at his house.Then of course there is this whole symbolism thing they have going on with Ichigo being the Black sun that is brought down by rain and Rukia being the White Moon.  Whenever Ichigo is in pain or has inner turmoil it rains. Every time this happens Rukia is the one who makes the rain stop. Orihime if we remember way back when the series began wants to be the rain so that she can connect two hearts together and finally understand Ichigo....She wants to be the rain...she figuratively wants to be the embodiment of Ichigos despair...Yeah...that symbolism says a lot... As far as her confession goes it remains to this day a completely one sided affair. It doesnt really seem to matter that she confessed since she never did anything about it. If Orihime ever intended to act on her professed feelings it would have happened in the time skip Rukia was not around. I could go on but I really dont want to as to avoid any more shipping war nonsense this could turn into. I dont want to turn this argument into the kind of shipping war conversations Ive seen on rnaruto with upakiironman destroying everyone with his Naruhina knowledge. Because thats what this will turn into but Ichiruki style.,bleach,cn4yic7,6,t5_2rk7q

You put that in the perspective of Ikkaku loathes fighting with abilities outside of physical prowess. it is literally god send. it gives him a weapon that He can utilize to the utmost in his own style.Then we look at his Bankai yeah its useless in a prolonged battle but thats kinda the point. Ikkaku is a live in the moment kind of guy. He doesnt think about how hes gonna deal with the next enemy he thinks how he can prolong his current fight as long as possible.But that is just how I see it.

3454006,0,t1_cplz0xb,Quincies are still massively limited by the speed at which they can absorb Reishi. The purpose of Vollstaendig is to lower that limit to the point where they can barely form a bow so that they work harder to reach their previous point and then once Vollstaendig is released their abilities are taken far above their natural limit.Even Ichigo would still be limited. Anybody whos stronger than him would be able to avoid being torn apart by him and anybody faster than him would be able to attack him.Keep in mind that Yhwach has this ability also. As his abilities become more powerful the closer they resemble actual telekinesis. Eventually hell reach a point where he can just look at someone and turn them into a puddle of Reishi he might even be at this point already but is holding back for the sake of fate. So as per usual itll come down to whoever has the most Reiatsu.Itd be really fun to see someone like Momo try to fight Ichigo at his full strength though.,bleach,cplzee3,3,t5_2rk7q

3631946,0,t3_31ymhc,Aizen had major influence on the entire manga. Thats why many stopped reading after he was defeated. He was such an awesome villan. I personally got tired of his always smug I planned everything attitude but still whenever he was in the manga it was always a oh shit type of moment. Madara was introduced pretty late into the Naruto story. He was just this name that Obito was using and when the real Madara came out it was like wtf. In terms of writing Id say Aizen was much more prevalent in the influence of events but as a character I find Aizen to be extremely boring. Just today I randomly wondered if Aizen ever actually felt the good human emotions like love or whatever. The closest thing we got was when Ichigo said he felt sadness in Aizens blade. And very recently when he was disappointeddisgustedsad when realizing how central  viewed him I was so happy because he actually seemed human in a way. Madaras backstory and emotions ideals and motivations really appealed to me because it actually seemed like he truly wanted what he was fighting for. This peaks when he casts Infinite Tsukuyomi and asks Naruto how dare he disrupt the happiness of everyone else. This guy truly believed he was saving everyone. His ultimate goals are good but his execution and methods for it are fucked up. With Aizen I still dont REALLY undertand what the hell he wants. He wants to kill the soul king...and what? He talks about this unbearable vacancy as if the soul king merely exists but doesnt exercise his power which is true. But what I want to know is what Aizen plans on doing in case he kills the soul king. Stuff like this should be fleshed out a lot more than it already has even though we are supposed to expect answers soon because the end is near. One other thing I like about Madara a lot is that with the little time he got as villan he wrecked so much shit and instilled so much fear and established such a presence. To sum it all up I feel that while Aizen is the better villan Madara is the better character. Dont even get me started about the bullshit that is Yawach. ,bleach,cq69q8w,15,t5_2rk7q

Though Aizen probably knows this.Though I have a feeling the device serves more than one purpose. Mayuri wouldnt make something that absorbs such ridiculous power and not put it to use. Plus something that can consume an unlimited amount of energy seems somewhat unlikely  I would predict it has a limit and therefor if Aizen were allowed to continue to push reiatsu into it then it would eventually explode when it got too full.Actually I wouldnt necessarily be surprised if Mayuri kills the coming Quincies and just uses the device to break into the soul palace.,bleach,cq72qe2,5,t5_2rk7q

3988009,0,t1_crar08o,The difference is that nearly all of Odas characters get satisfying endings or farewells when they are potentially left to never been seen again and the fact that he does that with so many is pretty impressive. Also for the majority of them they arent teased that they may return so when they do its more of a happy surprise than anything else. Just like with Crocodile who got a second satisfying end when he was no longer needed.The same cant be said for Kubo.

4045236,0,t1_crgyk9e,gt Prereforging Zangetsu was a Quincy spirit construct similar to the Ishidas Kojaku or Ywachs sword.PreFGT I dont think this should be the case.  PostFullbring Preforging theres an argument that can be made though Im not sure that I agree that its wholly a Quincy spirit construct.Zangetsu was a zanpakuto formed by Ichigos imprint upon Whites remnant which acted the part of an Asauchi due to having a similar composition.  While abnormal it should still be considered a zanpakuto.  OMZs involvement was in both suppressing and controlling the Shinigami side of Zangetsus power as well as lying to Ichigo about being Zangetsu himself.  He effectively served as gatekeeper to Ichigos power up until Bankai  where the reishi strand tying Whites remnant now Zangetsus Hollow side to Isshins Shinigami powers broke allowing HichigoZangetsu to gain ascendency.PostFullbring after having his reiatsu engine jumpstarted theres some very odd things about Ichigos powers.First and most troubling to me is that between being repowered and the forging neither OMZ nor HichigoZangetsu make an appearance at all.  Given whats happened and how chatty they both were this feels wrong.Second his state seems brittle and easily broken.  Both Ivan and Haschwald break parts  Haschwald breaking Ichigos Bankai blade with ease seemingly without activating any special powers.  While Haschwald is undoubtedly very very strong the ease with which he breaks Ichigos blade seems wrong.Third both blades Shikai and Bankai are exact replicas of those used by figures important to Ichigos past but of whom Ichigo himself is unaware at this point in time.  The Shikai blade is the blade of Yhwachs sword without the crossguardhilt Ichigo is unaware of the connection between Yhwach and OMZ at this time.  The Bankai blade is one of Whites armblades and Ichigo is certainly unaware of White at this point.  This ties in with the activation of Ichigos Quincy abilities a bit earlier.Yhwach states that Ichigos Quincy powers awoke because he completely expended himself within Quirges jail.  Having been expended his body absorbed reiatsu from its surroundings  including that of the jail itself.  Exposure of Ichigos core to that reiatsu awakened the memory of Quincy powers latent in his blood. Basically saying that it caused Ichigos soul to remember his Quincy heritage.If thats the case  I think its possible that Ichigos blades and abilities in this state could also be memories rather than a proper zanpakuto.  His Shikai state which he closely internally associates with OMZ who is ultimately a soul fragment of Yhwach and his Bankai state which he closely associates with his Hollow form which of course is based on White whose remnant acted as his original Asauchi.Its something of a crackpot theory but it makes sense of things that otherwise dont  at least to me.,bleach,crhdyb0,2,t5_2rk7q

He was only outclassed after Rukia and Renji returned from the Royal Realm.Though the major point is that while being on the same level of power as Rukia and Renji he comes off much worse than them to the readers. Kubo refuses to write scenes for him that cast him in a positive light. Hes what is called a jobber. He just shows up to be defeated as a way to create hype for the person that gets to defeat him.

I think he was way to mad about losing there and he was really surprised that Ichigo had still place to grow.. I do think he knew about the invasion of Yhwach though. The thing im just not sure about is ... is he evil or not?I just cant read that guy and it may be easier if i could read japanese but he seems rather cocky to everyone but still helps them as much as he can at least. If it turns out he is evil he will kill Yhwach and will step up to be the soul king. If he doesnt he will maybe sacrifice himself to be the soul king.I just think there are  possibilities with Aizen. Either he still is part of the story and will become the soul king and maybe fight Ichigo for it or he wont be part of the story and it will just end with Ichigo becoming Soul King..

4223488,0,t3_395hnz,Ive always just thought that Ulquiorra was by far the strongest and Aizen clearly knew this. He had him placed as  so that he could stay behind and fight Ichigo while he took the top  to the real world to fight the rest of the Gotei. Seeing as he obviously wanted to groom Ichigo into a stronger being not stronger than himself but just to see where Ichigo could go being the perfect hybrid... he set up progressively stronger and stronger opponents for him to face. I dont think him leaving off at an anticlimactic  would be very satisfying for Aizen honestly... That and Ichigos reiatsu and power were clearly on level with the Captains reiatsu being higher than most captains according to Unohana and Ulquiorra in his first release state alone curbstomped him WITH his mask ON without even the slightest bit of effort... While the captains at least seemed capable of somewhat defending themselves against the top  espada exclusing Shunsui because hes too much of a boss to even need Bankai.But thats just my opiniontake on the matter...

As we know even if he were suppressing his Reiatsu Yhwach wouldve been able to feel it a little bit but if he couldnt feel it at all that means hes transcendent.Im sure he could start feeling his Reiatsu when he used The Almighty though otherwise its a bit strange that he was able to instantly overpower Ichibee when previously he had to rely on unseen Quincy abilities.,bleach,ct2cz3r,5,t5_2rk7q

They were perfect opponents both understood the feeling and had a bond based on this. Not sure if anything actually romantic happened that we didnt see but they clearly see a bit of themselves in each other and are probably the only ones who can relate.

Some of which has been foreshadowed for a while but if you havent picked up on it then its hard to explain without spoilers.

So they werent taken. gt The whole point of Auswahlen that it allows Ywach to take back power that was originally his and redistribute his power...I know what was written in manga there is no need to retell it. But if you think logically about what happened during the recent Auswahlen how Bach got almost no power from the remaining Quincies comparing to what was needed to defeat the RG I dont see a huge boost at all youll see that it was pointless. I say its just an inconsistency he didnt actually need to perform an Auswahlen that time especially when we know that Cang Du was revived without it just with a Vollstandig activation.

Imagine Shunsuis opponent  sitting there slowly dying yet knowing that if he shoots at Shunsui he will also take that hit.

5577715,0,t1_cwnw0d4,Zangetsu iswas Ichigos imprint upon Whites remnant which served the same purpose as an Asauchi due to having a similar composition a stack of Shinigami souls as Oetsu puts it.  Once imprinted there arent two separate entities anymore only Zangetsu.Until Bankai Zangetsus Hollow side was still tied to Isshins Shinigami powers.  After Bankai the reishi thread breaks Isshin gets his powers back and ZangetsuHichigo starts encroaching on Ichigo vying for control of Ichigos body.OMZ up until the forging was suppressing the Shinigami side of Zangetsu hoping that the Hollow side would freak Ichigo out enough to dissuade him from becoming a Shinigami.So postBankai preDangai Zangetsus Hollow side was dominant and it was ruled primarily by Hollow instincts.  This had the result of making Ichigo enough like the Vizard that they would seek him out and attempt to recruit him and that their training method would have roughly the same effect on him.We havent seen a Vizards soulscape yet so we cant be certain of whether the Hollows that were inserted into them are wholly separate from their Zanpakuto spirits or whether those Hollows bonded with their Zanpakuto to produce similar hybrid entities to Zangetsu.  Mechanically theyre simply similar enough to allow Ichigo to move forward.However postforging everythings a little up in the air.  Ichigo made a fresh imprint upon a proper Asauchi.  Additionally OMZ is no longer suppressing Zangetsus Shinigami side.  That imprint looked like ZangetsuHichigo but hasnt spoken yet.  Until he does we wont know if these changes have also changed him in any meaningful way.I suspect that NewZangetsuNewHichigo will retain Hollow attributes not just because its been part of Zangetsus identity from the beginning but also because I figure hell be a key part of the solution to taking down Yhwach.,bleach,cwoguke,1,t5_2rk7q

5733395,0,t1_cx71nfs,Dont mistake I think Byakuya probably would defeat Ikkaku in a swordfight even with relatively evened out other physical stats. But I dont think its because hes a better swordsman. His battle intelligence is much higher and he probably is better in terms of precision strikes he was able to cut his own tendons or whatever against Zommari but I think in a more equalized fight he would also have trouble with Ikkakus strength and durability as well as the fact that he fights a bit haphazardly for fun which is hard to follow and plan for. He doesnt fight like most swordsmen. And Im not sure if I think Byakuya started as a better swordsman than Ikkaku either. We know he started the series much faster more intelligent better at kido and having an overall powerreiatsu advantage over Ikkaku and would wipe the floor with him in a full power battle. But swordsmanship is the thing Ikkaku has and has always trained ahead of everything else. He trains in zanjutsu at the expense of not knowing any kido. His only skill is with his sword and spear etc... so I think in pure skill Ikkaku is the better sword. But yeah we can agree to disagree. No Ill will. And I appreciate your side and opinion.

5746919,0,t1_cx99y9i,The fight can go many ways. Perhaps As thorns will never reach him. Likewise with Nanana and Pepe. Nananas projectiles could be blown away by West the same with Pepes arrows. Askin is sketchy we cant arrive at any valid conclusions about him until we see the entire extent of his schrift. We do not yet know whether Yama would cut Askin down before he institutes his abilities or exactly how the said abilities are applied suggesting that it too might be negated by West. Gremmy is still a brain in a jar this brings in the question of how durable the container is and what Im getting at is whether Gremmy can even approach the vicinity of Yama or whether he will erect a formidable defense before Yama strikes. Bambietta is a different story if we assume that her bombs can contact spiritual pressure they will still be blocked by West as it is an aura an atmosphere of dense reiatsu and if we deny that she can do it at all she cant reach Yama because there is no solid except his body but his fire would still obliterate Bambi. Remember that Yama is on par with Yhwach and Yhwach can take down all other stern ritter Haschwalth Uryu exempt with ease. We werent supposed to factor in the elites and Yhwach anyway it defies the purpose of the post. There are a lot of assumptions made here but I guess you could justify yours and me with mine. I respect your opinion as much as you with mine and it would be interesting to go in depth  if youd wish.Edit Forgot to mention how these are battles pertaining to spiritual pressure. Those with greater spiritual pressure would prevail its a core argument of my reply as any technique relating to projectiles would most likely be denied by West and the heat of the bankai.

5859061,0,t1_cxn6yqw,Ive said several times on this subredddit that I would have preferred if Kira died however it was confirmed that he didnt die a while ago in some special book or release or something I cant remember. Anyone able to clear this up for me? and was being treated by Mayuri. Since Kira wasnt going to be killed this is the next best thing. Hes very popular with Japanese and American fans so Kubo probably wanted to give him a little bit of spotlight too after thrashing him in the first invasion. And since hes one of the few major Gotei characters still down in Soul Society it is a realistic way to have him enter the fray do something badass and then we can refocus on the Royal Realm stuff. And to be honest it only works because it was Mayuri that did it. Im biased because Mayuri is my favorite character but its not deus ex machina at all when it has been established that Mayuri can do things similar to this taking over zombies Frankenstein Arrancar in previous chapters. In fact that makes it explicitly  not deus ex machina. I can understand not liking the return off Kira but if you look back at things now there are hints that it was a possibility. ,bleach,cxnnhb0,1,t5_2rk7q

Since he had only won over Quincy Zangetsu he never recieved permission to use Bankai from White and had to work on building a relationship with him. Unfortunately Ichigos misunderstandings on who Zangetsu was caused him to have an antagonistic relationship with White and ultimately led him to reject the actual source of his power. After that he only had access to what OMZ could take from White and what little extra White loaned him in the mask. Him becoming more like a Hollow more comfortable with using that power was akin to him accepting Hollow Zangetsu and allowed him to recieve more of Zangetsus power.

Because theres literally no reason for him to confirm that Ishida is a traitor by making him encounter Ichigo if he had the ability to see that beforehand unless hes just that big of a douche.

Not to mention he already cleaned up all the Sanrei glove detonator chips.Like with all the info excluding the future vision intel Yhwach has on everyone you know Ichigo and Uryu are tight and that Uryu doesnt tell people wtf hes doing. So naturally you would know that at some point hed creep off to tell his friends about his plan.Anyway for any SU fans I guess the eyes work similar to Garnets in which she can see the near future possibilities but not one singular confirmed future and obviously has the ability to move herself and others like chess pieces.And sorry if this whole blurb is redundant but theres either a bigger meaning behind this or Kubos suspension of disbelief has shot up a few levels.,bleach,czg5d6a,1,t5_2rk7q

You can tell what it is due to the presence of Reishi.Shunpo isnt massively explained but its essentially an intricate set of arts enabling high speed movements while Sonido closely resembles an instinctive form of Shunpo. Considering Arrancars occur naturally occasionally and most of them are capable of it it follows that the Sonido may actually predate Shunpo and perhaps even be the original form of it before souls learned to imitate it.

I think he deserved a few more achievements before getting fire fingered but there were Stern Ritters who achieved far less in the war.I think theres a small chance he might get saved if only to be used by the good guys for some reason.  He seems like he could betray Yhwach to save his own hide.Also I have a crack theory that says he used to have a big slappable belly before gaining his Schrift upon which he acquired those abs.

6667713,0,t3_46xt46,So... From what I understand Bankai is a boost.  This means that its not a true form.  Boosts by definition increase power from the standard.  This indicates that Shikai is the standard here.  Its like if I name my punches punches and call my haymakers ultrahypermegapunches.  Just because my haymakers are stronger doesnt mean theyre the true form of my punchesin fact theyre a totally different think.  Bankai is just a really really hard punch as opposed to your Shikai which is an ordinary punch.So that would extend to names as well.  Kinda like how Gokus name is still Goku even when hes in Super Saiyan Whatever The Actual Fuck.  Just because youre using an ability doesnt mean your identity has changed.Basically I think that Bankai is more of an ability than a form though sometimes your form changes as a result of it.  I mean think of IchigoZangetsus Bankai robeits thinner and more streamlined possibly to allow for more... aerodynamics... I guess...  Thats a bad example.  You see what Im saying though?  Changes in form from Bankai are usually functional to aid the Bankais performance.,bleach,d08zzgi,2,t5_2rk7q

Szyealapparo only beat fucking renjiishidanemu like congrats you can beat some shitty vice captain level fighters and he got raped by mayuri like it was nothing. aarrenierio is weak as fuck congrats you almost beat rukia someone whos not even a seated officier.

Thanks for the share!As for Bleach looking at how the SK looked like it works. However I dont know about Yhwach he seems more angry or bitter. Maybe it is because a long time has passed and thoses answers given by Yama not the former captain or maybe o and the fact that his father basically said shut up and kill yourself exagerated for the nd part made him like that.That could also somewhat explain the previous fight between Yamamoto and Yhwach as  you god of death tell me how souls and things work how about no? how about yes? k usually souls reincartate and thing insert here how it works in bleach but now that you know its not gonna be the same for you IMAFIRINGMABANKAI and obliterate you fy  but you missed im out for now seeya in years yeah sureTldr  myths are cool random morning thought on first yama vs yhwach,bleach,d0efb93,2,t5_2rk7q

6740055,0,t3_47zq2c,Its an interesting idea but for one I think that the core of it is based on something untrue.Aizens appearance is very clearly different prefacesplit and postMugetsu.  PostMugetsu Aizen has the teeth on the outside of his face and is covered entirely in a white shell.  His Zanpakutou also dissolves.  I for one believe that Aizen was correct in thinking that this meant further evolution.  Premugetsu he still had a Zanpakutou and was not completely covered in white.  I dont think we really have any indication at all that Mugetsu can steal power but the general concept of your idea makes sense considering the properties of Quincy power.

6885084,0,t1_d0w7k7l,KannonGuanyin isnt some random big woman. Shes a rather prominent religious figure both to Buddhism in general and East Asian folk religion. It may lack the cultural impact posttranslation thoughThere is one legend associated with Guanyin that involves her being executed and sent to hell. She was not punished her essence exudes so much compassion that she restructures Naraka around her. Sounds a tad on the nose but the Gift Beireich being restructured seems to be a reference to this. Theres another tale that also involves her father her executor falling ill and the only cure has to be made from the eye and arm of a harmonious being. Guanyin offers up her own eyes and arms to her own cruel father. I think Kubo referenced these tales really well the bankais eyes are closed and her arms seem artificialI really think this was one of Kubos stronger concepts. It seemed really relevant to me because Guanyin is significant in a PanAsian sense.

6904963,0,t1_d0yyqjt,I was gonna say the same i was just gonna give you  points for at least trying. You didnt understand. Let me see in the same orderOld Man Zangetsu real name is Yhwach but  years ago and the name was cover from Ichigo at the beginning of the series. The red box is that only Quincys like Yhwach in the other box can control the energy around them which is Reishi to stand up the Shinigamis use footholds to stand on the air. He was trying to teach Ichigo hirenkyaku. Urahara should had worry Ichigo became a Vizard instead of a Shinigami. Yet he acts like nothing having complete knowledge of this from  years ago. Foreshadowing the Vizards in away. About the Kido commander i mean that he  saw the mask in Ichigos face and he was present when the hollication appear and help Urahara turn everyone into Vizards. He remember that flashback with Aizen in an instant. lol That Quincys use the Shadows as gates other dimensions just like how Arrancars use Garganta and Shinigamis use Senkaimon. Old Man Zangetsu is Young Yhwach from  years ago. An Asuchi is a Zanpakutou without a spirit. Which was reveal that Nimaiya created them. So Ichigo never used Zangetsu until the manga when he acquired Zangetsu which is a dual zanpakuto.  Exactly how Ichigo suscontionely use Blut Vene to stop the wound on his neck left by Yhwach sword in the manga the other Yhwach stop Ichigos wound that Kenpachi made to him during SS Arc. Using a Quincy techniques which both of them have. Ichigo and Yhwach The way Real Zangetsu hollow guy acts around Ichigo is normal for an Asuchi as stated by the God of the Sword. The man who created the Zanpakutou. Nimaiya Oetsu.I wonder if you even know that his real Zanpakutou the real Zangetsu is White that Hollow Ichigos Zangetsu but you must know by now. The Zanpakuto knows like any other who is the master but they dont have to in equal terms. Like Renji his sword never told him the real name of his bankai until Ichibei told Renji.Not the same talk but it occurs after making that face like you dont who really is Zangetsu. during this Ichigos zanpakuto was getting control over Yhwachs power and thats why he never appear until Ichigo subjected his Zanpakuto when White dissapear. Tensa Zangetsu Yhwach as a teenager and Quilge are both Quincys and theres an ability called Skavelier that allows the user to absorb Reishi at the maximum way possible which is what everything is made of even a Hollow and they can fuse. If a fodder Quincy could do it why wont Yhwach the most strongest Quincy cant do it?Ichigo Hollow Side is Zangetsu his Zanpakuto spirit this has a spoiler tag for a reason. Yhwach is Old Man Zangetsu Ichigos quincy powers. Remember what happens when a Zanpakuto touches a Quincy Their power increases same here since Ichigo is both Quincy and Shinigami it works both ways for Ichigo Yhwach just placed part of his powers into Ichigos sword. ,bleach,d0yzwlb,16,t5_2rk7q

6992018,0,t1_d18bp4x,gtHonestly they seem like they have more background than Zaraki lol. Shinji alone is a better character than Zaraki.  That is your preference alone just as mine is the other way around. Lets face it there is a reason people like Zaraki and dislike Vizards and why Kubo seems to disregard them completely. Kubo failed to develop them when he had the chance and at this point they are just a nuisance to the story there is very little point in talking about Should have or could have when it comes down to it the bottom line is they served their purpose of giving Ichigo his MC powerup. Zaraki is definitely a one dimensional character as well but his one dimension is far more interesting than any of the Vizards and he has the quintessential Shonen role of being the meathead and many people enjoy such characters. I honestly think people are overestimating Shinji because for a captain and a Vizard hes been on the losing side of every battle he was in onscreen or offscreen and at this point unlike Zaraki it would make no sense for him to suddenly be able to beat someone like Gerard he is obviously not strong enough if any of the previous fights are any indication of his powers.,bleach,d18vyy1,2,t5_2rk7q

The only other character weve seen do this has been Nemu when she used  of her soul to launch an attack that demolished Pernida for a moment. After this attack she was visibly weakened and tired.Starrk said that he put half of his spiritual pressure into the wolves as a whole not each individual wolf. Those wolves were strong enough to make a nonfactor out of Love and Rose who while wearing their masks are markedly stronger than an average Captain. Even after this he was still strong enough to fight Shunsui with swords again using his spiritual pressure to make and go toetotoe with him for a while. So even when hes literally at halfpower he came just short of matching Shunsuis Shikai.,bleach,d2i625l,1,t5_2rk7q

All of these things that you say make Yamamoto stronger are indirect comparisons.How in the fuck can you compare his kurohitsugi to Yamamotos bankai?  Kurohitsugi is a kido move.  They are not analogous.All of these abilities that you are talking about are not comparable in the slightest.  To think that you can speculate on the potential area of effect that Aizens abilities have is just naive.Even when you bring up Ichigo damaging base Aizen you are literally talking about another feat from Aizen that is impressive as fuck.  Aizen in his base form took on Ichigos Hollowfied Getsuga tenshou his strongest attack and took negligable damage.  Why are you even bringing up Isshin Urahara and Yoruichi vs Aizen?  That was a three on one fight and it is clear that Kubo purposefully made it not a one on one thing  because it would imply that they were capable of doing it one on one.  And even if they were it is still completely irrelevant because after he transforms he is at a completely new level.,bleach,d2kvxuk,7,t5_2rk7q

Even if he did something different and decided to make your own reiatsu the poison instead the difference in reiatsu between dangai Ichigo and Askin is is way more than needed for Askins abilities to not touch him.

He had to awaken someone in his words most certainly meaning his hollow self he also references his Quincy powers a bit earlier. Its true that Ichigo is now in a state no other character has ever been having Shinigami Hollow Quincy Human powers all blended into one but this would also be the only time someone went Bankai without saying anything.To me this chapter is more him marshaling his Quincy and Hollow powers along the Shinigami powers he already displayed since his dualwield powerup versus the Sternritters. I think its a prerequisite for him going Bankai full release as it is. Tensa ZangetsuHollow was also a representation of Ichigos combined power so it makes sense thematically.Well see in future chapters.,bleach,d3k92sn,35,t5_2rk7q

Hisagi Bankai hopefully and another cool fight like against Findor.. Ukitake Bankai and actually getting a fight at all. More of his shikai too.. Ikkaku Akonmended bankai and a fight where he doesnt get trashed. Love his fighting style. And a personal favorite.. Yumichika Potential bankai or at least revealing his true shikai in front of everyone. A team battle with Ikkaku would be cool.. Iba Shikai power? Any kind of fight. At least his shikai command or name. Anything man.. Aizen Bankai obviously. Just general Aizen shenanigans and keikaku.. Ryuuken Finally shows up. Need some badass Ryuuken Quincy stuff from a nonSternritter.. Isshin More shikai abilities? Bankai. Kicking ass in a fight.. Love Bankai please Kubo. Also more of his shikai and maybe Visored mask.Also Tessai and more of the Royal Guards. Akon too I just want to see his shikai.,bleach,d3uok3b,1,t5_2rk7q

But there are two basic possibilities in my mind. Either he swings it so hard that a thin sharp stream of air concentrates on the blade and is launched at the enemy. Or its effectively the same as one of the secret sword techniques from Rurouni Kenshinwhich Oda worked as an assistant on. Where the sword swing actually creates a vaccuminduced Shockwave through the air.Razor wind type attacks in general are actually just super common in manga and arent actually the same thing as what Ichigo is doing. Though I guess its analogous. Ichigo concentrates Reishi on the edge of his blade just like Zoro probably concentrates the air.Also just for the record Im actually pretty sure One Piece did it first.

Funny enough if he could reach absolute hot minus a thousand degrees and they were both point masses of the same specific heat capacity they would average out to really fucking hot minus five hundred degrees otherwise known as really fucking hot.

I see her as the Sakura to Ichigos Naruto if we want to reference the other extremely similar shonen.  Orihime has talent something called out when she was getting Kid training much like Sakura had very precise control over her chakra.  However IchigoNaruto despite being far less initally apt had much greater reserves of ReiatsuChakra and as such were far more potent in combat.  The difference here is that Sakura eventually got some love in the plot whereas Orihime perpetually serves to be a liabilitymotive for Ichigo to do something ifightformyfriends.jpg.

7943048,0,t3_4o1uy5,We dont know because we dont know if Hollows steal each others hearts souls or reiyoku when they kill or eat someone.I would guess that they do not actually take the soul because if they did then the Espada Wonderweiss and Fura moving from Hueco Mundo into FKT should have created such a large shift of soul masses that it would have ripped the human world apart. Just like what the Wandenreich had tried to do at the beginning of this arc.That obviously didnt happen. So the Espada should not have possessed a large amount of souls within themselves.Further there was Grimmjows flashback when he was with his Fracciones as an Adjuchas. They told him they felt no growth in power after consuming their th victim.

8067067,0,t3_4polwf,Listen.Because contrary to the popular expectation one assumes of the strongest Stark revealed that being the best at something is a lonely road. Its not all gumdrops and ice cream being so inescapably superior in real life but especially as a hollow. The entire series set up hollows as beings which require death and sacrifice of others to survive and grow stronger. Each hollow dreams of being at the top the strongest the place where the endless struggle to survive and the suffering warlike cognitive processing and conscience can finally rest and know peace. Its never stated that this is why hollows do it but thats the end goal. Everyone wants to feel safe and happy even hollows. Ulqiuorra the darkest and arguably least human arrancar weve seen even desires peace...which he believes resides in nothingness but nonetheless he wants it. Stark revealed something about that peak that hueco mundo dreams of. It sucks. Youre basically guaranteed to live the rest of your life in solitary confinement in exchange for peace of mind. Stark likely lived like that for God knows how long until he decided to split his soul which by the way no one else in the series has done and likely for a good reason. I would wager that that kind of move is like rolling dice on life it either gives you a friend or you die. Idk. Regardless its clear that everyone wants that peace of mind and that hollows believe being the strongest is like heaven. Its not. Stark lost friends and family. Hes basically suffered major depression. Despite that hes clearly very intelligent and capable. He nearly beat four captains single handedly while experiencing depression symptoms immediately after losing another ally. Lazy? He accomplished more than any other espada while whining and bickering with his gun. Cant argue with results. Finally to explain his laziness its elementary hes depressed and depressed people arent even capable of seeing the point in fighting or working or fun or even living. Despite this he tries for Aizen. When Aizen signals that he is done waiting Stark stops fucking around and takes out Shunsui or so he thinks. When Aizen betrays Starks new pack by not giving a shit that number  died he is conflicted on one hand he wants to avenge his fallen comrade but on the other he no longer cares to fight for Aizen since he doesnt care about his pack like stark thought. While getting rekt by the vizards he cant make up his mind. When he does he proceeds to beat them hard. Hes a formidable paradoxical character that challenges the reader to relate to that dream of being the strongestbest and wonder is it really worth it? ,bleach,d4mtc3h,63,t5_2rk7q

The successor thing was just so he couldnt get any allies within the Wandenrecih and stage a coup or something like that.

The falling sales have been present for years now and have not yet devolved into complete loss Bleach sells relatively well. However Kubo was certainly asked to end Bleach more quickly albeit for different reasons.

He has to know them fully to be able to take shortcuts. Notice the ones he uses are all very intricate. Its not like a random power beam or whatever. Each one serves a specific purpose and performs a coordinated set of actions. Thats also how he knows referring below that the kido failed and that it wasnt even a third of what it could be.

Or is it just conjecture?gtSo for Bleachs great big th Anniversary of success we get a fucking full color chapter that many people in the community do anywayI believe the spoilers say the final chapter will have a color page not be in full color?gtHERES the kicker guess whats getting  front magazine cover? ONE PIECE AGAIN for  weeks striaght. Not Nisekoi thats ending and not Bleach. The only Shonen Jump manga in the entire history of the magazine that ever got a cover for its final chapter was Slam Dunk. Naruto never got the cover Dragon Ball never got the cover Rounin Kenshin never got the cover Yu Yu Hakasho never got a final cover. What makes Bleach different to receive this treatment.Anyways Nisekoi fans have nothing to be upset about. Komi had been closing off his story for  chapters so now that its ending there is nothing left to tell. He did everything he wanted to do and hes moving on to a new manga.If Kubo couldnt finish his story in time and wanted to waste fucking time on Mayuri fighting a giant hand and Chicken XAxis thats not Jumps fault.,bleach,d5t4ahv,16,t5_2rk7q

8461622,0,t1_d5yywx2,Blood War wasnt too dark it was just atrociously written and extremely boring. Its hard for people to go from villians like Grimmjow and Ulquiorra who had tons of personality to the sternritter who had much less personality higher numbers and boring backgrounds. I could tell you the espada in order I dont even remember one third of the sternritters names much less their schrifts. They were all devoid of personality and backstory aside from Bazz Giselle Askin and maybe Hashbrowns in the end. The ones that were slightly interesting like Cang Du Accurtrone and BG got killed off very quickly while the extremely over powered and boring ones like Gerard and Lille survived only to be killed by Yhwach was Lille even killed? I doubt well even see if he was killed or not down in SS. Yhwach has literally killed more of his own sternritter than he has killed shinigami. The problem with the Blood War arc wasnt its darkness it was the terribly written unlikeable overpowered enemies that eventually just get team killed because Kubo writes himself into a corner with their powers and needs to find a way to end it quickly.,bleach,d5z8lv1,17,t5_2rk7q

Liltotto even pointed how PePes abilities would have made the battle a lot more easier.Meninas was under the Loves spell. So it would have probably given her an easier time than a Meninas who is in control of herself.Of course PePe would cower in fear in that moment. He was beaten to a bloody pulp then sees Liltotto in full revenge mode. PePe usually lets his Love slaves do most of the worksimilar to Giselle.gtShe later discussed with Giselle how the two of them were stronger than Meninas and Liltotto and Giselle didnt disagree.She was saying that even though the Sternritters might be stronger that the Shinigamis abilities werent bad either. Which made things difficult.Scratch that last part youre right O.O. Heres the exact translationLiltotto Candi got taken out by an enemy.  Meni got controlled by Pepe so I took her out.  Theyre not dead far as I know.  We may be stronger but it wouldnt be great to lose them as an asset in battle. So I guess Liltotto and Giselle are indeed stronger than Candice and Meninas which I would have never guessed. Probably not by much though. Unless they were being cockywhich is a common Sternritter trait. Interesting thing though this implies that Meninas and Canidice were still alive. Meaning whoever thought Candi was killed by Byakuya was wrong.,bleach,d6f9tlp,1,t5_2rk7q

Youre even slow when you fall. Byakuya was the opposite of Ichigo willing to kill his sister for pride and rules. Ichigo would die for a stranger let alone let his sister die. When they clash its clear they are equals and Ichigo only got a chance to when because of White. Also White fucks on Byakuya like its nothing bro and if not for Ichigo intervening he would have murdered his ass. When Ichigo uses Tensa Zangetsu for the first time its absoultely insane.

8642349,1,t3_4y8lco,Well I have two things to say. The first is the quality was rushed so Kubo didnt get enough time to pull off his signature super long term writing style. So I dont think its even fair to talk quality here. We have to talk content. SPOILER ALERT although you probably came here having read itgt Where everyone is right now we get to see that the conflict is over finally. Everyone returns to their normal lives... except for Ichigo. No doubt he taught his son how to use his soul reaper powers. So he certainly wont be able to let go of that massive  or so chapter long adventure.I think thats pretty reasonable. I would have personally liked to have seen Chad become a bodygaurd since he likes protecting people with his powers but perhaps all this violence and necessary battling hes been exposed to has rubbed off on him. Uryu is a doctor. Perfectly reasonable its part of the family business. Him and his dad represent the merciful side of the religiously symbolic quincies while the sternritter represent the radicals who use their powers as justification for attacking people.gt Renji and Rukia are shipped together. Ichigo and Orihime are shipped together. Honestly I dont know what everyone was expecting. This seems about right. Think about it theyd have to conveniently make the plot prevent ichigo from aging and get rid of his human body entirely. Or vice versa. Shipping mortal humans with immortal ghosts is dangerous stuff.I know the whole it was fate thing is a very popular opinion and sound argument but keep in mind ichigos character is about defying fate. He even says so himself. You know the quote about shattering fate? Plus rukia and renji already had something going although what it was was debatable and Orihime obviously loved ichigo she directly stated it before hueco mundo and the first arc it was heavily implied. Where do I stand with things? I think this makes more sense whereas ichikia would be just about everyones except for me and a select few other ichihime fans ideal. But hey thats up to individual preference. Rukia  coldish on the outside tsundere with shiruyuki being an extension of that and soft on the inside and Orihime  selfgiving selfsacrificing caring and nice person with a shy side and a silly side. Yes Im fully prepared to be thrown into downvote hell for this. But please be civil and dont downvote for opiniongt Ywach and Aizen dialogue. One of the most meaningful dialogues in the series. We learn that Aizens basically a heroic guy with some bad qualitiestragic flaws willing to sacrifice others to obtain his goal even if his goal is justified and for creating his ideal world the means dont justify the ends.Let me summarize what this dialogue means. In a very brief manner. A world without superstitions hopes dreams imagination ideals aspirations and beliefs and need for improvement is a world where one would have nothing to hold close or cherish except for despair. I think Kubo really wanted to convey this message. Its very shonenesque but very meaningful.gt Finally da children. A legacy left by the ships a means to continue the plot in either canon or fanon. Thats a great way to end the series. If Kubo had more time it woulda still been a final chapter thing probably.gt In the end it was a very good ending imo. Leaves a few questions but answers most. The only thing off about it is a severe rush of pacing. But that couldnt be helped.gt Special announcement. Now that I dont like lol. It was Kubos final troll.

The last two chapters and even disregarding any shipping whatsoever its still terrible. Ishida is a Dr after saying he wouldnt be one. Ishin is absent from his own house. Chad is using his fists for personal gain which is something he said he was never going to do. Instead of expounding on where GrimJ Nel The goddess of Flash or Urahara are he instead wastes like  pages in  on stupid Hisagis bankai and how no one saw it. oh ha ha how funny. Sure if the ending hadnt been a massive rush that could have been interesting or amusing but as is? It was a waste of space other characters I actually cared about could have been. The stupid kids? Why does every manga I read need to end with kids? I have never cared about someones kids. I like the personcharacter. Not the kids. They havent gone through what theyre parents did and I have no desire to watch them but instead there they are taking up page time instead of Ishidas dad. Does Tia ever get out of imprisonment? Who cares lets look at some more members of SS we forgot existed. It just goes on and on. It was horribly mismanaged and I refuse to believe he just found out they were ending it that soon. If only the fights hadnt drug on so long that were pointless. Did the fight against the Mask need to last like a year? Did the last arc really need to be one long fight scene? We could have found out anything. Why was Ichibei revived? Who sits on the throne now and tons of other stuff if he had just sacrificed some stupid throw away fights. I also dislike the incredible focus the manga shifted to the G. I liked it better when you were rooting against them. Then they became super friends got really boring and took up copious amounts of screen time. Dont get me wrong. I am not a professional writer although I would like to be at some point but everything about the pacing of the manga lately for the last arc has been incredibly bad in my opinion and I just hate the ending for ruining it for me even more.

The problem is Kubo loves hes characters as much as a lot of the fans do so he wanted to give them all a chance to shine but this led to numerous plot threads never being tied up and a lot of questions.This is Kubos fault but I strongly believe Jump should have let him finish hes story at least in another section of Jump instead of just axing Bleach and forcing Kubo to give us another naruto final chapter.,bleach,d6nxsmq,1,t5_2rk7q

8745792,1,t1_d6ytnzq,gt Orihime Chad and Ichigo have always been walking clichs. At no point were they ever nuanced.Nah his passion for saving rukia in the SS arc was something that wasnt that cliche. It was definetly done before but after that his motivation just went to I wanna use my powers to save my friends. gt The FB thing is your opinion and totally lacks any basis in fact. Regardless it proves that Ichigo wasnt a compelling enough character to hold a story together.Really? Cause a lot of complaints about the fullbring arc are when the soul reapers showed up and made it seem like filler with the boring fights. That ichigo went under development by himself was its own thing the plot he was involved in didnt have the traction to be great for the reasons I stated. gt Again thats your opinion. If the main cast is boring as fuck it makes sense that the support cast gets more emphasis.Nope its a fact in general writing you dont let the spotlight hog over the supporting cast kubo did this in the last arc and we didnt see rankings improve. gt It all comes down to this. There was no place in the story for her after the SS arc. Same goes for Renji. So Kubo shoehorned them in as hard as possible and it shows.Bleach got popular from ichigo and rukia. Together. Like I even said there were light novels and a movie about them Kubo did have some plot with rukia worrying about ichigos hollow state but that went nowhere like orihimes plot with the hogyokuaizen. Youre just dismissing all of my points like the ones I made in the OP.

In the final battle after evening yhwachs Powers at least lets say quarter of it goes to Ichigo because Jugram is dead. Because of Almighty Ichigo protects his future from outside influence and Aizen and ichigo keep yhwach busy. when Aizen gets brutally injured Ishida shows up with Antithesis and reverts the damage to yhwach. While yhwach is staggered Ichigo uses Almighty on Uryuu and yhwach cant use almighty to kill Ishida but he gets skewered by silver arrow head and momentarily loses his power. Then Aizen kills Yhwach and obtains Almighty. Final battle is between Ichigo Uryuu father duo and Renji vs Aizen. Then we cut to chad vs statues...,bleach,d6zwz9h,2,t5_2rk7q

She killed him then healed him a bunch of times she could have left him dead but healed him because she was planning to sacrifice herself to make him stronger.  She was a step ahead the entire time.I dont that that would change too much from your predictions because the range and speed would beat any handtohand advantages.

In the SS arc Rangiku makes a comment about how hard it is to gather the Captains and that it may take a day. Given the scale of the SS that implies it could be that the Divisions dont know much about each other simply because they largely work independently of each other.

Its not that her character is badly written its that their relationship is  Kubo had  chapters to give them a good dynamic and by the end of the series Tatsuki the most criminally underused character in Bleach still has more chemistry with Ichigo. It doesnt matter how much you like Orihime or dislike her their relationship is a joke because in  chapters Ichigo never even thought about her beyond one or two shes in danger I should save her..All the development is onesided which makes it kinda of pointless. So yeah thats why that pairing is shitty...because Kubo didnt give it the time it needed to make sense and compete with Ichigo and Rukia who have so much panel time together. Even in the Fullbring arc Rukia was still getting higher billing than Orihime and now that I think of it the fucking final arc completely devalues the best part about the FB arc which is the idea that Ichigo cant be that powerful and remain in the human world.Its a fucking joke.,bleach,dazachm,-5,t5_2rk7q

10221509,0,t1_dc2nky1,With the color change the thematic conflict between Ulquiorra and Ichigo was that Ichigo truly represents the void element while Ulquiorra has a whiny emo view on nihilism that is less genuine.In terms of colors the void should be represented by white. The color that shows every other color together at the same time but shows no color. Black is apathy and the lack of feeling.So Ichigo begins black but when White comes out and uses Ichigos true full power level he turn white. White is also a perfect warrior he fights automatically and without contemplation or thought. He just instantly reacts to the threat. That perfect warrior blank mind that is always ready is how Ichigo represents the void element. So Ichigo entered a form that was a true warrior and changed color to the true void color.Ulquiorra seemed to have the ideological advantage through the fight. His views seemed to be true and inarguable. However when he comes up to his true form and true power he turns black. He wasnt truly empty his attitude was just an emotional response to his surroundings. Emotional expression was turned off in his mind due to the emotional trauma he experienced. The true void is nothing and everything at once. Represented in how White had a blank mind but could efficiently respond to any threat in battle. Ulquiorra was clearly driven by emotion and a very active mind. So thought and contemplation were very present in his mind. I guess was there ever a moment when you just didnt feel any specific way? Sitting in a classroom and waiting for the teacher to come in. Your mind assigns no emotional level to this experience. So you just sit there calmly sometimes without even thinking about anything until the event you are waiting for occurs. Thats the real void and that is not how Ulquiorra felt. Ulquiorra had a similar feeling driven by emotion that was just him forcing himself not to feel anything and smothering emotions that might pop up in his mind. ,bleach,dc2nydz,3,t5_2rk7q

10468932,0,t3_5pt8vc,Im gonna go with the sand metaphor that Yhwach used towards the end of the series for why Aizen is necessary to defeat him. Kyoka Suigetsu translates to Mirror Flower Water Moon according to le google. What Aizen does is very akin to wetting the sand to the point where Yhwach cant pick the individual grains anymore.  Yhwach states in chapter  or some shit that he hates the rain. I dont think this means he hates getting wet... giggity but rather he hates the idea of failing in his goal of creating a world without death his unattainable dreamAnd according to wikipedia that phrase Mirror Flower Water Moonis an East Asian proverbphrase meaning something that cannot be grasped like a flower reflected in a mirror or the moon reflected on the waters surface you can see them but you cannot touch them something that is beautiful but unattainable dreams a mirage.Its a good metaphor for most of the arc and the final fights anyway. The elite sternritter were god level. Everything seemed hopeless then Yhwach breaks Chairsama for the lols and suddenly there seems to be light at the end of the tunnel. We see Ichigo Renji and Aizen fighting Yhwach buts its all Kyoka Suigetsu shenanigans Aizen was fascinated by the fact that Yhwach saw Ichigo this concludes that Aizen doesnt actually have control over what Kyoka Suigetsu makes its victims see but rather the victim does Yhwach is seeing something he cannot actually grasp defeating Ichigo is his unattainable dream.,bleach,dcure2s,2,t5_2rk7q

10590729,0,t1_dd7s6of,It not fully making sense to you doesnt mean it is invalid. Its a manga where the author has purposefully hidden elements that hardly any readers can ever discern. Were you around to hear all the people that called bullshit about Naritas novel because of how he wrote Zarakis powers? Then that turned out to be true.If Tousens mask could make an explosion then any Vizards can. I just didnt remember it happening for Ichigo. The increase in power from a release doesnt have to be a dramatic spike. Each persons power releases increase their power by a different amount in a relative range and can be activated at different power levels. They can raise their reatsu level and then activate the release or release at a lower reiatsu level. Their own power can have a fast release actionanimationmontage or they can slowly shift into their released form.The black energy on Ichigos blade is reiatsu. So his releases are creating reiatsu spikes and explosions. Whether it is invisible pressure or an outpouring of his own energy. However during the Arrancar arc when he was mostly using his mask his powers werent stable. His Bankai release would have been weaker than they should be while his mask would be as strong as it could be.Ichigo and Tousen were the only Vizards that embraced their mask powers and relied on them. They are also the only that had explosions when their masks were activated. The other Vizards did not rely on or embrace their Hollow pwoers. So their releases would have been weaker.,bleach,dd8cols,0,t5_2rk7q

Stark and Barragan were the number  and  Espada because their reiatsu was the strongest according to Aizen. SuiFeng couldnt kill number  with Bankai. Kyoraku killed number  with Shikai.Shikai Kyoraku reiatsu gtgt Bankai SuiFeng reiatsu. That means Bankai Kyoraku with the x boost would be over  times stronger than Bankai SuiFeng. Now the question is can Aizen negate a fresh SuiFeng Bankai? Even if we give him the benefit of the doubt and this is a stretch honestly and say he can now the question is...Is his power far greater than over x that amount Bankai Kyoraku to be able to one shot with his sword and it is my belief that its absolutely without a sliver of doubt most certainly not.

Maybe its related to my love for minor characters but idk.Close seconds are Kannonbiraki Behimie Aratame and Hakka no Togame for being from characters weve known for so long and not disappointing at all.,bleach,dg0w5m5,11,t5_2rk7q

11591568,0,t1_dg98hdy,Right but Kensei at least has what seems like a wellrounded Bankai and may even have more to the iron side of things that we never got to see. We at least saw that his knuckle blades had several different forms which means the Bankai probably has a lot of potential that Kensei just hasnt unlocked yet.Mayuri is a good example of why having a full Bankai saves some people. Without it hed just have the big caterpillar baby which once it dies is completely gone. It also doesnt really represent the most dominant part of his personality which is his desire to modify everything.Rukias powers are the power to freeze things and the power to control snow. Theyre also respectively white and dancing and the used kanji for togame means punish rather than accuse which seems to represent some sort of judge jury and executioner thing that I dont quite understand for her.gtHaving a bipolar CC seems pretty risky from what I know of the condition.Bipolar people actually tend to make great leaders. Theyre known for having a quick wit and no filter which means theyd excel at quickly reading a situation and responding to it which is something we definitely see from Shunsui a lot. Routine and activity keeps the massive shifts in check though in Shunsuis case his manic episodes are really mild. I think Kubo might think that the more depressed he is the more mild his manic episodes should be. Not entirely how it works but que sera.,bleach,dg9wuxt,1,t5_2rk7q
11600410,0,t3_65k9be, I think Ichigo is some different and is some ways I agree with youusually I dont really like main characters.

11685500,0,t1_dgkfx1c,Sure thing. Its from the Tite Kubo interview of Arrancars Visored naming and secret topics What a mouthful.Its kinda confusing. Kubo explains he chose Espada because it is the Spanish word for sword so theyd be perfect opponents for the Shinigami. Then he said he didnt even have a concept of the Espada when Ulquiorra and Yammy as those are the first  he created first appeared as shadows in HM??? I have no idea when this happened in the manga. Apparently the ones who were gathered there were supposed to be the Espada but Kubo thought there werent enough. He goes on to explain he wrote the Kanji for Espada as ten swords because it looked western. And thats where he got the idea for having  Espada from so he thought of having  Espada only after he called them the ten swords.A little later is the Deadly Sins part. Kubo says he wanted to base them on the Deadly Sins. Barragan Aaroniero Szayelaporro and Yammy are some of the earliest Espada so are based on the Deadly Sins. Aaroniero iswas gluttony. Barragan Szayelaporro and Yammy are likely to be pride lust and wrath I guess since its apparently linked to the names of their Zanpakuto.This is the point where he decided there would be  Espada. Thats why not all of the Espada represent Deadly Sins. Kubo didnt want to be restricted by the Deadly Sins  so he saved them to use them later for a story about the original Espada that were still alive. Supposedly they were chased out or disappeared on their own.In the manga Zommari said Aaroniero was the last of the original Espada. And given he was created to be Gluttony in the  Original Espada it makes sense that since the Original Espada bit was kept in the story then the Deadly Sins part was too. Seemingly Yammy Barragan and Szayel were retconned into newer Espada but Aaroniero wasnt so Kubo could keep that potential plotline open. The Privaron Espada seem to fit in quite well. They were kicked out of the Espada a little after Aizen started using the Hogyoku. Although the Kubo interview was done much after the Privaron were introduced so that cant be the story he was talking about. But we can say the  Privaron and Aaroniero were originals and that still leaves  others that he couldve been talking about.Oddly when Dordonii is talking about the Privaron being replaced by Aizen it shows silhouettes of Nnoitora Szayel and Aaroniero. Which would mean that Aaroniero was NOT one of the original Espada unless Zommari meant the original group created by Aizen and not the ones that existed before. This is actually backed up in the databook MASKED which says Aizen made Aaroniero an Espada because he saw potential in his ability. Although what Zommari said wouldnt make sense if Szayel and Nnoitora became Espada at the same time. In the manga Aaroniero says he IS an Espada because of his ability not that he was MADE into one because of it. So we can guess that maybe he meant he is still an Espada because of his ability and just ignore the silhouette thing. Or maybe Aizen demoted him and brought him back later? But these are just guesses based on conflicting information.All we know is that the original Espada were supposed to represent the Seven Deadly Sins. Kubo changed his mind but kept the idea for a future story. Maybe Aaroniero and the Privaron were in that group maybe not. That part isnt very clear.Theres some other interesting stuff in the interview. If you want I can put the whole thing into an imgur album for you.,bleach,dgkkho3,2,t5_2rk7q
11691597,0,t3_66tvbx,I think its a technique that allows you to launch all of your power in one attack since Ichigo never really used all of his power before using all of it at once would cause at least some damage for him.

He couldnt even sense hollows. Why do everybody think FGT has something to do with quincies? Isshin said he had learnt the same technique from Engetsu and he said why their Getsu zanpakutos dont wanna teach FGT to them since it makes them lose their power when its used. Its a shinigami technique thats all.,bleach,dglubzt,1,t5_2rk7q

11729269,0,t3_67d4ne,Im not sure if youre getting into Shnen anime for the first time but I think I can say most of them starts light hearted and begins to gritty later on the series at least midway through the series lol. All I can say is if you enjoy long series watch it there is filler in the series that Id say you could skip unless you want dwell more into the bleach universe. Heres the Bleach Episode Guide you could follow me personally I watched everything and I will say that I was satisfied with the show. Now I will say the anime does end short but the story is continued in the manga amp imo rushed towards the end. So Yes Ichigo does mature later in the series amp the show does get gritty later on the series. ,bleach,dgpjkd1,5,t5_2rk7q

11740976,0,t3_67j7ir,Aizen vs Haschwalth  The Wandenreich have been collecting information about the Soul Society for a while. They know of Aizens Shikai and he hasnt shown it to any Quincies. I am going to ignore the part where Aizen somehow hypnotized Yhwach while still in straps. Without the Hogyoku and KS Haschwalth should win.Ichimaru vs Cang Du  If Gins serious and doesnt play around he should win this.Tosen vs NaNaNa  Seriously?Stark vs BazzB  Blocking Yamamotos flames is a huge feat. And so is defeating posttimeskip Toshiro without even trying. I dont think Stark have enough damage output to take down BazzB. His Ceros barely do any damage to Shunsui Love and Rose and dont forget how dumb Blut is. Remember Quilge vs Ayon?Barragan vs BG  Quincies are humans. They have a normal lifespan not the hundredsthousands of years Shinigami have. Barragan is even able to rot concrete so this should be an easy victory.Halibel vs Quilge  Quilge didnt impress me. He was losing badly to Ayon. Also Halibel is a hybrid fighter capable of longdistance combat.Ulquiorra vs Gremmy  sends Bat to spaceNnoitora vs s Ndt  Nnoitora has a lot to fear.Grimmjow vs Bambietta  One got defeated by Shinji the other fodderized Shinji.Zommari vs PePe  Uhhhhh . . . Im just going to choose to one I like more. But really he who loves first loses.Szayelaporro vs Giselle  Depends on how powerful are Giselles zombies. But I dont think Szayelaporro can take down Giselle since any organ he destroys can just be replaced.Aaroneiro vs Nianzol  Aaroniero cant hit him.Yammy vs Driscoll  Yammy should not be the  Espada.,bleach,dgqvb9k,5,t5_2rk7q
