The Wellesley seems to be your best bet for comfort cause youll have less neighbors. I have friends in the building next to that one and theyve been happy there although that says nothing about the actual building the location is fine. However its probably all up to price but if I were you I look into the Wellesley first. ,waynestate,ci4gnqh,2,t5_2stg6
