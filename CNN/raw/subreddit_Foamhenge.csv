7799965,0,t3_4f5bvr,Sadly now that the state has purchased the Natural Bridge and surrounding property to be designated as a state park Foamhenge is being evicted.My girlfriend and I went on vacation in the area a few years ago. Most of the vacation revolved around Mark Clines works. We drove all over the area hunting down art installations hed done. It was a blast. We wrapped it up getting a tour of Mr. Clines workshop after which he left us to wander around and check out everything. He and his assistant also showed us the fiberglass Stonehenge replica they were building for a customer.Cline was taken back at the number of his sites we had already been to but managed to tell us of one we hadnt seen yet. He was also stoked that we had arranged out trip so that we were at Foamhenge for sunrise on the Autumnal Equinox.When Cline erected Foamhenge he had an expert plot it out to match Stonehenge accounting for longitudelatitude change. So the sun rose exactly between the stones that morning as intended. It was such a cool experience.Here are a couple pics.Dawn breaks. The first pic I took. When we arrived it was dark and Foamhenge was enveloped in mist.The sun arises. This moment was one of the goals of our trip. To stand in Stonehenge witnessing the sunrise on the Autumnal Equinox.,Foamhenge,d3srzcs,1,t5_35tia
