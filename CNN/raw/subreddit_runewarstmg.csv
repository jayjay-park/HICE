11783538,0,t1_dgvi6pb,I agree with FaiLoadeDice In the Rules reference it says If the unit would overlap no more than a single tray of an allied unit during a move. and does not overlap any part of that allied unit at the end of the move that allied unit is not considered an obstacle... . Squaring up occurs After a unit collides with an enemy unit . So because when you collide you are still touching an allied unit you have to treat the allied unit as an obstacle. That is the way I interpret it. The only exception is if only the connectors are overlapping then see .,runewarstmg,dgvpalt,1,t5_3frjb
