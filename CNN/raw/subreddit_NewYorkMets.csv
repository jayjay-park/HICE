148142,0,t3_1vrj7u,Arroyou and Garza are not in the same league. Garza has much more of an upside. I would not consider Arroyo a big time free agent. Garzas price is probably too high for them. He was traded during the season so he could not be offered a qualifying offer.I dont understand why you didnt mention Mejia. It seems like as long as he can stay healthy its his job to lose. Lannan is there in case he cant. I could see them bringing in another low end guy but theyre not going to break the bank for a guy that hopefully wont even be needed by the end of the season.It would be dumb for them to bring either Montero or Thor out of camp with them. If either of them or both of them are good enough to the point where not having them on the staff at the beginning of the season is the reason why they dont make the playoffs then they are good enough for the Mets to really benefit from having an additional year of them under team control.If either of them does head north with the team it would be Montero who has spent more time in the upper minors and is believed to have the lower ceiling.,NewYorkMets,cevayog,1,t5_2s7w9

Looking at these photos and claiming that one portion is designed as a tribute coupled with Citi Field looks nothing whatsoever like Ebbets Field is  disingenuous.

630844,0,t1_cgbya2w,Agreed on all points. Great defense is going to make any pitcher throw more confidently but younger pitchers moreso. He swung the bat reasonably well in spring training too. Ill take a . OBP combined with his glove any day. It sure beats the . OBP he put up in the majors last year. He put a lot of work into his swing during winter ball and it shows. With his defense he doesnt need to ever be an offensive asset in order to be a starter he just needs to develop to the point that hes not a liability offensively and from what Ive seen hes made that adjustment. If he can consistently put up  dWAR a season he really doesnt need to do much at all with his bat in order to justify a spot on the roster. Defense matters especially with a young pitching staff. With Grandy and Chris Young added to the roster this year were going to be getting plenty of offense out of our outfield but we need Lagares out there in center to make the defense rock solid.,NewYorkMets,cgbz7e4,0,t5_2s7w9

756113,0,t1_cgq69px,Again I think youre using statistics to mean individual accomplishment. In reality the more a team relies on unknown or lesser talent the more likely it is to rely on statistical methodologies to achieve its results.You say Parnell blows big saves. Parnell blew four games last year in  chances. Not Craig Kimbrel but respectable. However theres a more obvious point here Parnell has never had a big save opportunity. Until the Mets contend there are no big games. The bullpen in aggregate could have maintained every lead last year and the team still would have been mediocre.As to keeping Ike did you not follow the winter meetings? They tried to deal him to anyone who made a decent offer no one did. Ikes numbers are why no one wanted him and theyre why the Mets chose Duda to be the primary first baseman despite Ikes superior spring training numbers.By the way I was at the last game of  and Reyes didnt sit out his last at bat  he pulled himself out of the game after bunting for a single in the first inning.

He doesnt have the budget to chase top tier guys because anyone with a proven track record is going to cost more than the Wilpons have to spend. Free agency isnt how you build a team unless youve got a YankeesRed SoxDodgers type payroll. Resigning Wright and signing Grandy are pretty much the only two big budget signings hes had Colon and Francisco both were midtier signings that reflected budget reality in my opinion and its too soon to see how those will pan out but on paper I think they both look solid.    Edit Id also add that a lot of his free agent signings so far have been fan service rather than meant to be practical in moving the organization forward. The intention was never to field a competitive team in  but rather to get as many short term assets off the books in order to build for  and beyond. He needed to keep  bodies on the field at all times in the rebuilding period but any of those  bodies who werent part of the long term picture of the organization were just placeholders for him. Theres no point padding your payroll unless youre serious about trying to compete so he scraped the bargain barrel to keep the team functional while he rebuilt the organization.,NewYorkMets,cgw0m7l,1,t5_2s7w9

948615,0,t3_24w4x7,Theres really no point in spending extra money on the bullpen for a team that isnt a contender this season. Yes it can be depressing to see game blown late but these few extra heartbreaking losses arent going to make the difference between making and missing the playoffs. This team isnt built to win  games.If you look at the season from the foot level and ignore the emotional distress of blowing games late it makes sense what the front office is doing. Theyre not wasting money on a short term bandaid to win a few extra games this year that will mean nothing in the long run.Once the young pitching comes up you supplement it with bats either developed signed as FAs or traded for using the young pitching depth and then build the bullpen as the last step since thats easiest to do in a short time frame.,NewYorkMets,chc45i0,1,t5_2s7w9

1104945,0,t1_chtpgha,Youre entitled to your own opinions bit not your own reality. Colon was one of the best pitchers in the game over the past two years and was only signed for two. Young has hit  homers before and plays Major League CF defense. Considering Juan Lagares unproven track record and the short small salary it is a defendable move. Could they have gone in a different direction? Sure but short of Ellsbury an injuryprone player who got an unnecessarily large contract there just werent good backup CF options available.I absolutely agree that Sandy could have done a better job but free agent signings other than Granderson and Francisco have been perfectly okay and we didnt lose much with Francisco and the jury is still out on Grandy though I am very much unconvinced there.Overall your argument is that bargain bin signings make you angry  thats fair. But in baseball terms lowrisk signings by definition are not bad  Byrd Hairston Hawkins and Dickey diff GM being great examples. The point of a lowrisk signing is to catch lightning in a bottle and Sandys done it. Cant fault him for it. You can absolutely criticize him in other areas  our SS situation for example but your current argument just isnt very good since it is attacking a relatively minor part of his body of work.Youre getting downvoted here because you dont seem to understand GM strategy or roster construction not because we disagree with you on Sandy not having been a great GM.

Even if he regesses he has an unlimited ceiling.gtHarvey continued to garner accolades for his arm strength and control in . New York sports radio host Mike Francesa has compared Harvey to standouts like Justin Verlander Andy Pettite and Curt Schilling. After watching Harveys first two starts of the  season during which he struck out  in  innings former Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Harvey had the potential to be the best Met pitcher to ever wear the uniform.  His April performance garnered him Pitcher of the Month honors after he posted a . ERA with  strikeouts in . innings. Opposing batters hit . against him. Dwight Gooden gave him the nickname THe Real Deal after he saw him pitch live.gtOn April  Harvey had a nohit bid through   innings against the Minnesota Twins until Justin Morneau hit a solo home run in the bottom of the seventh inning. On May  Harvey retired the first  Chicago White Sox batters he faced until Alex Rios broke up the perfect game with an infield single. Harvey left the game after nine innings having surrendered only the one hit as the Mets won in  innings. He was subsequently featured on the cover of the May   issue of Sports Illustrated magazine dubbed The Dark Knight of Gotham. On June  Harvey took another nohitter into the seventh inning but was stymied by an infield single off the bat of the Atlanta Braves Jason Heyward. Harvey notched a careerhigh  strikeouts in the game giving up three hits over seven innings.gtAs the midseason AllStar break approached team management talked about limiting Harveys innings to ensure his pitching health. Harvey had thrown  innings in  starts at the time which put him on a seasonlong pace for  innings. Mets manager Terry Collins said Harvey would not be allowed to pitch more than  innings.gtHarvey was the starting pitcher for the  MLB AllStar Game which took place at the Mets home ballpark Citi Field. On August  Harvey pitched his first career complete game shutout giving up four hits and striking out six in a  win over the Colorado Rockies. On August  Harvey was diagnosed with a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and was placed on the disabled list. He had logged   innings at that point.Is his summary for his  season on Wikipedia. He ended the season with a lt WHIP a . ERA and  SO.The SO were st in the MLB while he was rd in ERA nd in WHIP th in ERA st in FIP etc.It would basically take a  trade for TuloStantonSpringer for the Mets to give up Harvey,NewYorkMets,cira6z0,2,t5_2s7w9

1408150,0,t3_2a9383,Heres the section that talked about the MetsgtNew York MetsOakland AthleticsgtgtMets receive LHP Tommy Milone RHP Ryan Cook and B Nate Freiman gtgtAs receive B Daniel Murphy and RHP Bartolo Colon gtgtgtAs GM Billy Beane already made one blockbuster deal but why stop there? The previous trade already gives the team its best chance at winning a championship since Beane became a GM but the team has one remaining need a solid second baseman. Why not get greedy and trade for Murphy who is leading the National League in hits? While hes at it why not reacquire Colon for another year and a half giving the As a twoseason chance for a championship? That would give the As a rotation of Sonny Gray Scott Kazmir Samardzija Colon and Jason Hammel with Jesse Chavez on the ready and that would give them a much better chance of beating postseason nemesis the Detroit Tigers. With Murphy the As will have lengthened their lineup and eradicated the only position in which they dont have an aboveaverage major leaguer. gtIn return the Mets get yearold Tommy Milone who won  games in  and  games in  and is  with a . ERA and . WHIP this year. Sure hes a backoftherotation starter but hes also  years younger than Colon and his finesse ways would blend well with hard throwers Matt Harvey Zack Wheeler and Noah Syndergaard. gtMeanwhile Ryan Cook would upgrade the Mets bullpen and is expendable for the As and if he stays healthy he could develop into a closer. The key to the deal for the Mets could be Freiman who has tremendous power from the right side. Many scouts think that if hes given the chance to play every day at first base he could end up being a homer RBI producer. He just needs the opportunity. ,NewYorkMets,cisshny,5,t5_2s7w9

They actually didnt want to incur the signing costs of the two first round picks they were in line to receive as compensation. It was shortsighted and stupid. Just an awful baseball move but it wasnt Minayas doing. You can blame him for the talent he got back but understand that he was making a waiver trade in August and didnt have much leverage. Boston was the only team to put a claim in on Wagner.No GM in their right mind would give up two first round draft picks unless they were told to Especially Minaya who did an excellent job of running the farm system. If you want proof of that just look at all the homegrown talent on the major league roster that Minaya is responsible for.  ,NewYorkMets,cj5l1km,3,t5_2s7w9

2164077,0,t1_cleqa82,I agree I also meant to actually have a sentence in there about Plaweckis numbers against lefties versus Dudas but it seems it slipped my mind. I do however believe it is possible for a professional player to learn how to hit lefties. The career plate appearances for Duda against righties is  for lefties . I would also assume that during his baseball career up to that point in minors and before then was also that in favor of facing righties. So not many pitches coming his way from a lefty. If Duda can learn a bit better how to hit lefties we are talking at the very least  homerun seasons. I think we get every lefty the Mets have in spring training pitching to Duda extensively it would most certainly help his confidence and numbers. If he does not improve that is when you platoon every lefty start. And this is to occur now because Duda has blossomed as a slugger. His defense would also get him the start for me most games against lefties. ,NewYorkMets,clewk34,1,t5_2s7w9

If he were a steady defender Id be more patient with seeing the bat develop this year but if he doesnt make some big leaps as a major league hitter it could be supremely ugly. The Mets dont necessarily need a high proposition SS but they do need someone who can at least be league average between defense and hitting. Right now Flores is neither and being good enough as a hitter to make up for his really bad defense may be his max upside and thats a lot to hope for in a contending season.,NewYorkMets,cmrw284,1,t5_2s7w9

2855343,0,t1_cnsn6ry,gtBecause they cant literally sign no one over the course of  years. The Wilpons are obviously sensitive to the fact that people blame them and their inability to sign players for the teams struggles so they sign the lowest top tier free agent they could. If you dont think that Mets ownership is sensitive to public opinion then Im not sure what team youre watching.Its amazing in one post youre saying Cuddyer and Granderson are not what anyone wants and dont help the team and the fans are discontented about it and then literally minutes later you are saying they signed them because the owners care about manipulating public opinion.gtI dont think they spend lots of money on lousy players. I think that the signings of the past few years have been ineffectual. They wont hurt the team in the long run. Nor will they help the team in the short run.  million dollars for  years of players is not that much money so it would be silly to present it as if it were. But again if you really think they couldnt have added productive players in the last few years if they expanded their payroll to  million then it seems to me like you just cant handle criticizing the team.I think its the opposite  if you think Cuddyer and Granderson are unproductive players then you cant handle not being bitter and pessimistic about the team.gtThe Cuddyer thing is not a separate argument. Do you really think that Cuddyer is the type of free agent that Sandy Alderson would target?I dont know what this question means.  Alderson signed him so yes.If you mean in the fantasy world where the billionaire real estate developers are broke paupers and commanded Alderson to waste  million dollars on swaying public opinion thats a bizarro world I dont live in so I cant answer.gtOn the Red Sox the point remains. Once they dumped their contracts they actually signed players that could make the team competitive. We havent done that.We HAVE done that.  The only place where the Mets are seen as not being competitive in  is in Metsblog comments the Post  and WFAN.gtThe Twins achieved that through the farm system. What big name free agent did the Twins sign in the s? They had to trade Johan because they couldnt afford to sign him. My point is that the Mets can build through the farm and through signing people.That is exactly what they are doing.  They are building through the farm and signing people.  You just dont like the guys they are signing.gtThe Royals and Twins cant just expand payroll to where the Mets are capable because they wont have the same increase in revenue.Because the Royals and Twins STUNK for a long time.  Like the Mets have stunk for six years.  Its not the market size.  The Royals play in the same market as the Cardinals and they have no problem spending money. gtAt this point weve built up the farm system about as much as we can. In the near future youll have a lot of guys contributing while making the minimum. This is the perfect time to supplement them with players that can actually put the team over the top. I understand its easier said than done. But thats why Sandy has the job and I dont.Right and thats why hes making better decisions than you would if you got the job tomorrow based on what youre saying here.gtbut I can tell you that Granderson and Cuddyer are not moves that will put us over the top. Thats just a sports radio cliche though.  Its a group effort.  All the players add something incrementally and fill roles.  If you dont sign guys because they dont instantly make you a World Series winner...  youll never sign anyone.gtI cant reconcile the fact that Sandy has done such a great job on trades and has done such a terrible job of signing free agents. Thats why I think its pretty easy to infer that hes been hamstrung by budgetary restraints.Or more likely the FA signings fit right in with the trades and make a lot of sense but you dont like them because you wanted the old declining guys that went to the Yankees and irrationally made up a fantasy scenario where Alderson has zero or very little say in what guys he signs.,NewYorkMets,cnsniov,1,t5_2s7w9

I still think that Davis career was derailed from his sprain and as someone who suffered from a bad sprain during a fencing indecent I know just how detrimental they can be for pretty much the rest of your life. As soon as I saw it was from taking a foul ball I immediately felt better because then the worse case became a broken foot bone which heals better than a sprain.

3623846,0,t3_31ve5q,So the first thing is that there isnt too much to talk about yet in the season. So any little story that comes out can get blown up.gtFrom my perspective it doesnt matter if the front office is getting involved with the lineup cards as long as TC doesnt have a problem with it. Normally how baseball teams work is that the Front office make personnel decisions and the Manager makes the lineup and makes the game decisions. In Oakland Sandy was known for having managers who would basically listen to his orders . We were told that this would not be the case in NY with Terry and to this point that has appears to be the case. Terry has made some strange moves especially with regards to bullpen use that seem like Terry is the one in control of the game day lineup.gtOn the other hand if TC doesnt agree with what is happening he will never admit it to the mediaTrue if The front office was over stepping their boundaries we would never hear it form Terry. Its not a huge deal if the front office is making the lineup. Terry is a guy who is not super old school or set in his ways and he ishas been willing to try new things over the years. I would say that it is a deal its not necessarily bad but it is a deal.I think some of it is getting overblown because batting Wright second and Duda rd is really really strange. If the lineup was changed slightly so that the pitcher was batting th and then Lageras was batting th then it would make a lot more sense. Maybe we will see that with our pitchers who are a little more adept at handling the bat.Quote from the articlegtMLB.com veteran reporter Richard Justice talked in person with a front office executive Monday at Nationals Park who promoted the idea of batting your teams best hitter second in the order Justice told MLB Network Radio on Tuesday.This sounds like the front office went to Terry and presented the info that batting your best hitter second might be better than batting them third. Terry then agreed with the Front office and decided to try it out.So yes I do believe that this is getting blown out of proportions and that at most this was a strong suggestion from the front office.,NewYorkMets,cq5cfqc,3,t5_2s7w9

4149302,0,t3_388li1,In a heartbeat. My biggest issue about trading Thor for a guy like Tulo is that Tulo is nearing the end of his prime or he already hit it.Puig is . Hes under control for  more years and he wont make more than .M in any of those years. At that point Id have no issue signing the guy long term for  years when he hits FA at age .This is exactly the player I would trade Thor for as much as I love him. Puig is one of the elite hitters in the game in my opinion. Hed be our Bryce Harper with less power.If we were to make this trade Id prefer that they do it in the offseason. Syndergaard will probably really up his stock by then and money will come off the books. At that point Id move Cuddyer to the bench put Grandy in LF and stick Puig in right. Matz will be more capable of pitching  innings Harvey will be unrestricted we will be half a season closer towards Wheeler and Montero will be there as well.Edit And Id be fine keeping Syndergaard as well. I think either of the routes are great options for us. But personally if the Cubs were asking for Wheeler and Syndergaard for Castro I cant imagine how wed get Puig for Thor and Weick. If the price is what the Cubs were asking for you keep Thor and just confirm that we will have the best rotation in the league for the next  years.,NewYorkMets,crt8gzh,4,t5_2s7w9

4349744,0,t3_3atk9p,The offense is really getting ridiculous. I defended this team earlier in the season and said to give it time but now Im and all of us are getting impatient.We were told to be patient and that when the time was right ownership would spend money. The time is clearly right. Despite our anemic offense we are still managing to hang around. The Nationals look vulnerable and the rest of the division doesnt seem like its going to be threatening any time soon. Now is the time to make moves and establish ourselves in this division as a strong team. We have an amazing well rounded pitching staff that is being completely wasted. It is inexcusable that Harvey is still losing starts  like he was two years ago. I feel like all of the talent that Sandy has cultivated these past couple of years has arrived and there is nothing more he can do he just needs the money to fill out this roster which he is so clearly not getting. I place all the blame for this incomplete roster on the Wilpons.I have a bad feeling that at the trade deadline we are going to move some young pitching for a decentish bat and its going to have a minimal net impact on the talent level of the roster. We dont need to be trading prospects WE NEED TO BE SPENDING MONEY! I see so few people on TV talking about this and it amazes me that the Wilpons have somehow created this narrative where we are the Rays and can only be successful by moving prospects back and forth because we have no money. Yes we will always be second fiddle to the Yankees but New York is one of the largest media markets in the entire world and if the Wilpons cannot operate a franchise where they are making and spending a lot of money then they dont deserve to own the Mets. If this trade deadline passes without the Wilpons demonstrating a willingness to spend on this team then its going to be hard for me to be excited about the Mets in the future as long as the Wilpons continue to own the team. This is probably the most talent weve had on the roster in almost a decade there is literally no reason to not spend money on this team unless the Wilpons dont have the money or dont want to spend the money. And if thats the case then we will never be good outside of a fluke year here and there. So please Wilpons prove me wrong. And please Mets fans tell me I am overreacting.  ,NewYorkMets,csfy5do,8,t5_2s7w9

Sandy didnt want to give up a major piece and overpay in talent for Zobrist when he could recreate the same value via Johnson and Uribe while giving away peanuts. Money was never a factor especially seeing as Uribe  Johnson basically cost the same in payroll as Zobrist would have.

You can walk that line when the team is  games back in September.  When you have a team that is clawing for a playoff spot I stand by the playoffs being decided in that final series against the Nats you cant not show up and expect people to embrace you.

Sure the Mets look like theyre going to be competitors for the next three years while Harvey is around but theres no guarantees. Wright of all people knows how things can go from looking like youre playing for a perennial contender into playing for a below . team for years. If Harvey sits out the stretch here and the Mets melt down theres no assurances of when or if hell have another chance to play in October in the future.

Like its eitheror?Thats certainly what its sounding like. People are ignoring the fact that the team played terribly and instead are trying to place all the blame on Harvey.And again there is absolutely no proof that Harvey coming out contributed to the loss. The numbers dont agree with that statement and the entire idea around it is based on what ifs and hindsight.gt Errors can happen in any game and being in a hitting slump can happen in any game but Harvey being designated  and fly contrary to the Mets wishes is something that reduces their chances of winning before pitch . So its understandable that people are upset. It creates an issue for the Mets to deal withwork around in addition to whatever game mistakes or poor performances they get as a matter of course in  innings.Yeah thats understandable. People have a right to be upset about the whole situation. But thats not what were talking about here. Were talking about the impact on this game specifically. Harvey leaving the game in the th did not have an impact on the defense or offense which are the two things that contributed to the lost.gtIf you know your starter is going to go  or less period no matter how well he pitches then you know youre at a disadvantage going into the game. Thats foresight.Again were not talking about before the game. This is specifically about the idea that Harvey coming out caused the loss. Knowing about what happens before the game doesnt even matter in this discussion. Were strictly talking about how the move impacted the game.And how does knowing youre at a disadvantage affect the game? If they let it affect them then they shouldnt be a professional athlete. Theres a lot more high pressure situations than this.gtIf they lose  and you conclude from that score that Harveys contributions never mattered then thats hindsight. Its results oriented rather than process oriented.Except no one is concluding his contributions never mattered. Im concluding that based on his numbers from past performances and the things that actually caused the loss the idea that the game would have been different had he been in is false.gtTotally speculative and even if true thats one extra inning of middle relief you dont have to use.Its not really as speculative as you think. Theres a lot of numbers that back up the notion that Harvey is shaky in the th. Its clearly his worst inning and at  pitches all it takes is a hit and a walk to get him out of the game which weve seen plenty times in the past.And it doesnt really matter if you get through the inning without using that part of the bullpen since the bullpen never caused the problems.

Robles should have been out of the inning which would have allowed Reed Clippard and Familia to be used in the th th and th.,NewYorkMets,cv9hcpx,2,t5_2s7w9

5415667,0,t3_3p7w9z,When looking at the mph stat I think Thor is going to be more effective than Harvey tonight.Thor is looking amazing this postseason and is no stranger to a scary looking lineup after going against the Dodgers. Except now you replace the veteran Dodgers lineup with a rookie Cubs lineup. Arrieta didnt do so well on his last start. Hes  innings pitched past his previous high. Hes tired. Now the final key to the puzzle we need wright cespy and Duda to show up tonight. This is a hugely important game. If we take down their ace and take a  lead going into game  with deGrom even my Cubs friends admit that it would then be over. They see this game as do or die. Lets kindly show them the way to the graveyard. On another note I think Terry really needs to drop wright in the order. How about Grandy Lagares Murphy Cespy darnaud Duda wright Flores. They were saying that wright needs to be put in a position to deliver. I dont think he likes the lead off role hes in. ,NewYorkMets,cw3ws1l,24,t5_2s7w9

5496892,0,t1_cwe8z6o,I agree But I think what he wanted to say was he wanted a better baseball guy sports caster not a jack of all trades game show host. Sure Im biased but Gary Cohen is a great sportscaster but one of the reasons is is cuz he works really fucking hard at it. I think Joe Buck is another talking head who is good at filling the void but not at really telling you the story. Fox for a long time had Tim McCarver who got really bad with age. While he was a player and at one time a very good broadcaster he just seemed to get full of his own shit and liked hearing the sound of his voice. As bad as Ernie and Cal were with Ron this is going to be far worse. MLB should have a local option for fans. Itd make the wins more memorable and the losses far more tolerable for all fans. ,NewYorkMets,cwea3f5,5,t5_2s7w9

5530555,0,t3_3qunec,the mets did lookStale after such a long layoff. And the royals were fouling off every strike and letting go every ball. Their level of competition is relentless. But I think Thor and Matz are special enough to counterbalance the royals mojo. Thor is young and naive enough to be unaware hes supposed to lose with all the pressure of game  down . Matz has had MLB debut MLB PLAYOFFS debut for his hometown backyard team within the calendar year. So game  should be just another career milestone that has manifested yet again within such a short time I do not expect him to be overwhelmed. Theres still enough magic for the mets left.

5561314,0,t1_cwmf2oc,Absolutely. With Tejada and Flores both providing good value at SS theres no reason to rush him. A September look in  would be a best case scenario if he rakes in AAA and looks more steady defensively up until that point. Both Plaw and Herrera I think got promoted too aggressively and major league pitching can be unforgiving to young hitters who still have holes in their swings to exploit. Herrera looked a lot more refined in AAA this year so I think hell be good to go for  but I wouldnt be upset if the Mets decided to send Plaw back down to AAA to start  so that he can get everyday playing time to develop more. Reynolds Im not even the slightest bit sold as being a big leaguer. He was pretty unimpressive at the plate in the hitterfriendly environment of the PCL and his defense at SS left a lot to be desired too.

5601273,0,t1_cwr7l3t,Obviously none of us are involved in the decision first hand but Id be shocked if he took an AAV under  million over the year deal unless it was  years. Since people just want to downvote me or use rudimentary math symbols rather than discuss it heres why I say that.Were not talking about especially long term. Even the people who dont think he would ever sign the QO seem to see only a  year term on the deal so over that short period of time the net value of the deal doesnt get a chance to build up a ton at a low AAV. People are literally saying  mil a year over . mil for one. Besides injury which is insurable and I said so in my original statement so its not like Im backing down what could Murphy possibly do in one year to drop from a  milyr guy to an  milyr guy? If he went . thats a net loss of k over the  years but with proper investment its still worth well more than the longer term compound just  mil of that first year at  and youre a million dollars ahead of that four year deal.Lets say Murphy has a roughly average season compared to your favorite prediction statistic next year. What does that mean? Well it means the same deals are probably available again only with higher AAV since figures generally increase year by year. You know what else will be there? Another QO. Another chance to get a raise because the AAV for the purpose of that calculation will have increased. The Mets would be stuck having to offer again or theyd lose compensation. This isnt about wanting to play for the Mets over other teams this is about simple economics. Compared to  year deals at an AAV  of the QO there isnt as much incentive for Murphy to take the higher gross value as you guys seem to think.,NewYorkMets,cwre46w,-1,t5_2s7w9

5608894,0,t1_cws9cyf,Not sure if it was any specific mechanical issue but deGrom had spots late in the season where his control was spotty. He had a lot of very poor pitch heavy innings early in these games but he was able to fight for six innings. He could still throw strikes but his fastball would be all over the place allowing batters to work the count. If I had to put my finger on a specific reason why his control was bad later on in the season I think it was most likely due to fatigue.  He hit a rough patch late August to early September but his last two starts the first coming after a skipped start and the second a reduced start on  days rest were very promising ensuring deGrom was back to . His playoff starts were spaced out well and he only had  starts before the World Series but I think the extended workload from pitching in the playoffs begun to take its toll.

5925692,0,t1_cxwdynq,They should highly consider resigning him because hes quietly been a top  B from how everyone bitches about his inconsistency you would think hes a replacementlevel player but they have a good future inhouse option in Smith and dArnaud is a FA after  so we can get two years of dArnaud at first then replace him with Smith. We could definitely move Duda at the  trade deadline and acquire a lefty platoon partner with dArnaud who can start against righties while dArnaud is catching and start dArnaud at first against LHP.Of course if dArnaud turns into a franchise bat Id rather lock him up to an extension and leave him at first allowing Plawecki to be the fulltime catcher allowing us to still have a great catcher behind the plate and we get to preserve dArnauds health. Smith is also one of the best B prospects in the minors so we can get good trade value from him.,NewYorkMets,cxwe0qt,1,t5_2s7w9
5935053,0,t1_cxxlc2o,gtYeah its debatable. But usually a prospect that has advanced through the minors as well as Fulmer had would be valued higher than a th pick who is still a huge question mark. Id take a guy closer to being a solid middle of the rotation starter in the majors than someone yet to be drafted. And Meisner was going to be in the top  in our system and Cessa probably top . Theyre late picks but you always have late picks that improve their stock as they succeed in the minors.Right but at the same time these guys have shown that they are really good at turning late picks and leftover late picks from their predecessors into valuable players so losing one  pick to gamble on a talented but brittle guy isnt that big a deal and neither is filling a hole in DecemberJanuary with a brittle guy with the downside that you might have to do it again later.Especially when that guy is someone like Cespedes and you get him so cheap which is impossible in the offseason.,NewYorkMets,cxxm73v,1,t5_2s7w9

5946422,0,t1_cxz36lc,For starters on base percentage is a much more important statistic than batting average. Why? Average just considers hits. OBP measures how often a player doesnt get out which is the singular most important thing a hitter can do. If you dont value the other things as much thats fine. Youre entitled to your opinions just fine. But the Cubs  with a very highly regarded front office  apparently do view him as an  player and we know of at least one other team that viewed him worth higher than that and multiple other teams that were in that ballpark. As for WAR its not perfect and its certainly not without its issues particularly with defensive valuation but its not just some made up crap. Its based very heavily in reality both logically and mathematically and its intuitively reasonable.

6234844,0,t1_cyy9jc2,Having a deep bench is the single most underrated component of any team in any sport. Just look at the difference in the Mets when they added Johnson and Uribe. They were immediately a much improved team even before they added Cespedes. Nieuwenhuis Recker Tejada Mayberry. Thats youre opening day bench. Add in warm bodies like Campbell Monelli Muno Hererra. I might have missed one or two. Thats pathetic. Not a single potential everyday player in the whole pile. AAAA at best. Everyone knew the Mets were thin going in. The idea that no one saw injuries coming to Wright Cuddyer or dArnaud is ridiculous. Aldersen must have slept through the last couple of years because all three are injury prone. Aldersen went into the season on a wing and a prayer and got whooped upside the head when all three went down. That is squarely on Aldersen. You cant even blame it on payroll. Obviously Aldersen learned his lesson. The whole offseason so far has been about getting deeper and giving Collins some options. Far better bench going into this spring than it was last year.Im not going to rehash the GM argument. The idea that you want to give Aldersen credit for Minayas work or pat Aldersen on the back for the success of Cespedes when he only picked him up because he couldnt get the first three guys he tried to trade for is thin on reality. Those ideas were preposterous the first ten times you asserted them and theyre preposterous now. Im not going back and forth on it again. I agree to disagree.Youre dead wrong on Parra. He hit over . against righties last year with a  OPS. Ill take that in a second. Defensively hes a two time GG winner. His overall metrics dropped the last few years because he played all over the outfield. Look at the splits and youll see hes still an excellent to elite CF. De Aza isnt even a hasbeen hes a never was. Hes a warm body. His speed is gone and he hasnt hit double digit home runs in years. And hes not a CF hes a corner outfielder and a defensive liability wherever you play him. Hes a bum.To try to compare him to Parra on any level except maybe payroll is nonsensical. The Giants think Span is healthy and theyre one of the smartest teams in baseball. They worked him out and signed him right away. As far as bullpen goes Bastardo is the best of whats left. Hed be a decent fit. I was hoping theyd go after Tony Sipp but he resigned fast. Edit One last thing. You love to throw Drew and Morales in my face so Ill repeat myself. Both of those players got signed during the season without the benefit of preseason or spring training with their clubs. It is now and has always been a recipe for disaster. You cannot compare what they did in a truncated season to what they might have done with proper preparation. I never advocate signing guys inseason. It doesnt mean they couldnt have had much better years under better circumstances. Look at what Morales did last year. ,NewYorkMets,cyyc160,1,t5_2s7w9

6360964,0,t1_czcnarm,Edit I dont think Im flip flopping. If you think I am I apologize because Im probably not explaining myself clearly enough.In a more literal sense the former is information  the Cubs are talented established and proven  and the latter is opinion. In a less literal sense I think better goes beyond talent. I believe the Cubs rotation is better right now because they have experience and track records that the Mets dont. Four of them have strung together multiple successful seasons and Kyle Hendricks is a very underrated pitcher with a . FIP entering his age season and an extremely successful minors career. The Mets have a ton more upside in their youth and it might be enough to make them better already despite their relative inexperience. I think theyre better but I recognize that theres an entirely valid argument  and a good one at that  for the Cubs.The Cubs are better right now but the Mets have enough upside remaining that they may be better soon enough to pick them now. I think Matt Harvey is the best pitcher in baseball and I can make a good argument for it but Clayton Kershaw is the best pitcher in baseball until proven otherwise.,NewYorkMets,czco5ru,6,t5_2s7w9
6362839,0,t1_czcmimg,the cubs pitchers have lengthy track records of success?  Lets break that down if you dont mind. . Lackey this is a pitcher who before last year had never posted a sub  ERA in his career and had an ERA below league average between  and . He just signed to be their  pitcher. Lackeys track record of success is about as long as Noahs and Noah isnt the  year old nearjunkballer. . Arrieta Arrieta has been an excellent starter for a shorter period . years than both deGrom . and Harvey .. Lester a very good pitcher who has really revitalized his career these past two years due in part to improved command but he hasnt yet seen his velocity decrease which is a horizon fast approaching as he just eclipsed  years in age.. Jason Hammel about as exciting as meatloaf. Fluky k rate fueled by a slider that hitters started laying off in the second half contributing to an abysmal  ERA and . FIP. Kyle Hendricks somehow he managed an  k but still came back down to earth in the second half of the year as his walk rate skyrocketed with hitters laying off junk. Shades of Steve Trachsel with his lack of speed boring repertoire and lack of ability to go  innings. Besides Lester who exactly has the string of success? Even with Lester considered Harvey has had the longest period of success of any pitcher on either staff and the success  favors the mets staff even though the only pitcher the cubs have under  is hendricks. ,NewYorkMets,czcvugr,6,t5_2s7w9

MLB players are paid for  days and if they are suspended by the league they lose money on a proportional basis. But the league only issues suspensions for regular season games not spring training nor off days. Mejia would have been paid . million dollars if he wasnt suspended for any of those  days. Instead he would have been paid only for Spring Training the off days during the portion of the season in which he was serving his time and then the games following the suspension. This would have resulted in him making . million. For the Mets this would have meant that down the stretch they would have had a well rested bullpen arm that they could pitch to the ground because they wouldnt be able to use him in the playoffs.

I cant find any concrete details as to his back problems from earlier in his career but if it was a muscle or other soft tissue problem it could speak to his pregame preparation...not properly stretching not eating properly for example Dwight Howards time with the Lakers was riddled with injuries especially back problems. It came out after he left the Lakers that he was eating like shit all season. The Rockets got him a nutrition consultant and hes been relatively healthy since.  ...or maybe hes overexerting himself in the weight room or in drills.   With his most recent injury it seems like he tweaked something but TC says it could be related to his throwing.  TLDR  It could be a number of things really.  The Mets maybe should try and see if theres a deeper lying common problem with his injuries.,NewYorkMets,d2jbj2t,2,t5_2s7w9

7742806,0,t1_d3m6xr7,gt What I think you were really trying to say in the beginning was that youre against players playing on one side of the ball without substitutional penalty. Which is where the DH differs from PHs and PRs.Which is very different from what you actually said which is that all players should hit and field which is clearly NOT what youre in favor of.The problem is not that I cant articulate but that you actually have  common sense. That is a distinction that you and you only have made. A pinch hitter and a DH are nothing alike. You take the reason of playing both sides too literally when you should have used just a smidgen of the common sense you so clearly lack and realized that if hes immediately coming out of the game he isnt really playing. I dont think anyone in the world has ever considered a pinch hitter a oneway player because it isnt a position and it isnt a made up spot in the lineup like DH is. There are  spots in the lineup and  positions in the field and they should all be occupied by the same players. This still applies with a pinch hitter except that he never gets to play the position he is now required to play since he is now taken out. It isnt that he isnt playing defense its that he isnt playing at all. This is such a clear and massive difference that you just simply cant make. I strongly advise you to learn how to use your brain to think about something instead of taking something literally every time. In the rule book it says a balk is anything the pitcher does to try and deceive a baserunner yet almost every lefty bases their pickoff move off trying to deceive the runner. Technically its a balk every time but it will never be called because the umpires realize taking the rule  literally would be dumb. You keep saying the distinction that I made is that I said they should have to play both sides of the game but that PHs arent so Im contradicting myself. It isnt a contradiction because they still are required to play the field the moment they are in the lineup. The second they are out of the lineup that doesnt apply since they arent playing anymore. You really cannot compare that to a DH or say that it is a small difference. The DH doesnt play the field because he doesnt have to a PH doesnt play the field because hes not playing in the game. Just because someone didnt end up doing something didnt mean it wasnt a requirement for them to do it. So yes I can say that a PH has to play the field and not be contradicting myself when he doesnt step foot on the field.gt The end result is that both the NL and AL have oneway players but only the AL ones bother you for whatever weird arbitrary esoteric reason.No only the AL has oneway players. If the NL had oneway players it would bother me greatly but they dont. For whatever weird reason you cant seem to understand this. Its ok using your brain can be hard. I have faith that one day you will learn to utilize the power of your brain to actually think something through for once.gt If a player plays on one side of the ball hes not hitting and fielding. That was your initial objection and its baseless because NL baseball has the same thing in a slightly different form.Once again hes not playing on one side of the ball. He is coming out of the game before he has a chance to do something he would be forced to do. That is entirely different from not playing on the other side of the ball. You calling the difference between a DH and PH a slight difference is like me calling a plane and a car similar but with a slight difference. True they are both modes of transportation but they are entirely different.gt Whereas in the AL he could just get a chance to finish the great game hes pitching. Which is what most fans pay to see  not managers bureaucratically filling out lineup cards and doing double switches.No wonder you are arguing for the DH you like things handed to you on a platter. Who the fuck cares how well deGrom is pitching if his spot is up the order and we need a hit then you have to decide whether your bullpen can finish it out or whether you trust him to get the big hit. Taking the easy way out is not the way the game should be played and thats all the AL is. The AL essentially is the league for people who feel like people should only have to do things they are good at and if they arent good at it then there is no way they should have to do it. Also fans pay to see their team try and win the game and to be entertained. These kinds of decisions are what make the game great because you cant always have the best of both worlds.gt Its a special designation that allows a player to hit in the lineup without a fielding position. This is just semantics.Aka he doesnt have a position and like all baseball players should have to play a position to be in the game.gt It should and it is. The AL is  vs.  too.  guys hit and  guys field at all times.It isnt because  guys are actively playing in the game at the same time. gt Lets say youre an NL manager and you PH de Aza for Colon and then put Robles in to pitch the next inning. If we use your bizarre method of counting guys in the game that you just used  guys just played for your team in that inning so its  on .Actually no because the moment a guy comes out he is no longer playing and doesnt count obviously. You can pinch hit  people in an inning but only  players are in the game. This is the simplest thing in the world and somehow you manage to not be able to understand that no matter how many people make make an appearance in an inning for an NL team there are only  people in the game. In your scenario the moment De Aza is announced as a PH Colon is officially done and no longer counts as a player. So while De Aza was the th player to make an appearance hes still only his teams th player. Very simple stuff here.gt But really only  guys were ever in the game at the same time same as with the DH. Of course you know this youre just selectively applying the  on  thing when it benefits your argument.What do you know you were able to understand this! So how is it then that you failed to count that the AL teams have  players in the game at the same time. Being on the field on the field and being in the game at the same time are totally different things.gt The DH just allows you to accomplish what PHing accomplishes... but with a special exemption that the pitcher can stay in the game. The reason being that none of them can hit so its silly to ask them to.You keep calling it a special exemption like its just some minor tweak. Its a massive difference. Which is why they created a whole new rule to make it legal since it is illegal otherwise. gt You can hope all you want to but it will. Sooner rather than later.Only for business reasons its inevitable. Anyone with a brain knows the NL game is a much better game.gt Then why were they still consistently incompetent terrible hitters in the  years before the DH existed?Because hitting is hard which you wouldnt know because theres no chance youve ever stepped foot on a baseball field. Just because something is hard doesnt mean you shouldnt have to do it although I doubt you understand this because you obviously are the kind of person who just stops doing something the moment it becomes hard. I know this because you keep arguing with me by making stupid points because making stupid arguments is easy for you. Making a logical point would be hard work so you stay away from those.Lets just make one thing clear here you are doing nothing but arguing for the sake of arguing. You like the idea of the DH I dont. You however keep saying my arguments are invalid simply because you disagree not because they actually are. ,NewYorkMets,d3mau9e,1,t5_2s7w9

7760894,0,t1_d3noysg,I think Chase is a very good hard nosed ball player.  I think he was trying to break up the double play the best way he knew how.  That being said  that was a vicious slide.  He did the same exact thing in  and injured tejada then too and the Mets took exception to it.   I cant find the article from that game but I remember both RA Dickey and David Wright essentially saying that if the league continued to allow Utley to tackle guys at second like that it would lead to guys getting hurt and teams seeking retaliation.  I think the changes to the slide rule make sense.  Again no one cared that he didnt touch the bag nobody does it was the fact that he threw his whole body into a defenseless player.  He has done it throughout his career.  People have said he would eventually hurt someone and he fucking did.  Dont act like that play came anywhere to resembling a slide.  He could have still broken up the double play without destroying tejada.  I respect Chase though.  he knows he is a target and even he looked shocked when noah got thrown out last night. ,NewYorkMets,d3ocqiv,1,t5_2s7w9

I dont blame them for this but in hindsight it looks like the Mets made a mistake not resigning Murphy. With his stenosis its impossible to rely on Wright on a daytoday basis having Murphy would provide us a huge luxury as he can play  infield positions. None of them particularly amazingly mind you but its clear he has made some adjustments that have turned him into a much improved hitter.The obvious counterargument here is that you continue to block Herrera. Meh. Id rather keep a prospect in the minors too long than have to trot out bums like Ty Kelly and Eric Campbell on a regular basis.

We run the risk of letting him play in these games where he keeps failing time and time again. Its going to be even harder to pull him out in the Majors when things get tougher and tougher. Now maybe alot has been put on his plate with everyone injured but he either needs longer periods of time off which would fit your idea better or he needs to spend some time in AAA to find his swing. ,NewYorkMets,d3zzok8,1,t5_2s7w9

Technically the pennant race means the whole baseball season though we say that a team isnt really part of it if its not in contention. Obviously getting down to the wire in September is where it gets really exciting but dammit we are definitely in a race with the Nats right now and theyve tripped and fallen lately just before we face them and this is good news.

8221377,0,t1_d54e4bh, went pretty much as expected not that any of us expected much but thats the point. Sandys moves at the all star break is what saved the team last year in my mind. The team did not over perform the st half of last year the pitching was great as expected and that second half team was an extremely good team we got lucky the Nats were awful for a good chunk of last year.This years team was expected to be very good and even after the injuries weve had the pitching has been pretty dominant Everyone but Harvey under . as recent as a week and a half ago. The pitching is absolutely the reason the team is still around and the offense has been less than expected even with the injuries for long stretches. Do I blame that on Terry? No but I think this team is where it is right now because this team was very good AND very deep coming into the season despite what it seems like at times we luckily only had to deal with Ty Kelly and Soup for a little while.Terry is definitely a players coach in the sense that he keeps the guys in the locker room happy but there are things Terry does or doesnt do outside of bullpen management that frustrate me to no end.  He consistently benches people as they get hot Not just Flores in this stretch it is a recurring theme with him This team and especially last years team makes a lot of mental mistakes decision making on the field bunting base running etc these are things that are generally due to a lax attitude of a manager. Physical mistakes will happen mental mistakes come from lack of leadership. His lineups some times are just ridiculous. He went through a stretch of batting Lagares leadoff last year or very early this year? when Lagares had literally the lowest OBP on the team. He plays theory over what is actually happening within the lineup. I think he is terrible at developing young hitting talent. His obsession with platoons is over the top and doesnt give people like Duda Lagares Conforto etc the chance to develop into every day players.Is Terry the worst manager in the league? Probably not but it really feels sometimes like this team wins in spite of him. Edit Sorry should have made clear that the main points Im addressing is that he isnt consistently willing the team to over perform and that I have issues with more than just his bull pen management.,NewYorkMets,d5588gs,1,t5_2s7w9

8288129,0,t1_d5djl3m,gtThe tiein to  in this post is tasteless as hell.You could have just said In honor of... teams. A base hit that let Mets fans see their arch enemy lose a world series for the first time in four years or event just In honor of... teams. Arizona wins their first world series in walkoff fashion against the Yankees.Sorry but the  backdrop is an important part of this series.  They made it that way by running the obnoxious Yankees are George W. Bushs army fighting for freedom on the wings of a bald eagle media blitz into the ground at the time.You might have found that really inspiring but a lot of us thought it was repulsive including people who dont even care about the Mets Yankees baseball or sports in general and just thought the juxtaposition of those two things and the pseudopatriotism involved was really shameless.Like I said earlier to each his own.  If you jumped on that populism train that ulitmately lost that was your right.gtMaybe Im just saying this because I know people who were lost in the attacks but yeah. This isnt cool.So did I.  Does that mean Im supposed to root for teams I cant stand for three designated weeks before I go back to hating them as part of a sports rivalry?  What changes if I do that?  The people dont come back.You opted to root for the Yankees.  I will never understand that but thats your right.  I wouldnt tell you not to do that.  You shouldnt be shaming people who rooted for the DBacks and experienced joy and relief from  depression and sadness that day.  That is what is really shameful here IMO.People deal with tragedy in all kinds of ways lots of us dealt with it in watching the Yankees get denied a championship.  It was a small victory compared to the senseless tragedy that happened but then again the Yankees winning would have been a small victory for people like you who wanted that too.  The point is its not your job to declare whats good for NYC.  Lots of people in NYC dont give a fuck about the Yankees and each individual person can determine that for themselves.,NewYorkMets,d5dkpqi,2,t5_2s7w9

But the organization loves him for some reason likely because he doesnt demand a lot of money. I also understand the fact the hes a players coach and the guys love him and playing for him and the fact they went to the World Series when the Mets actually gave him some good players.But at the end of the day the guy is still a horrible manager. There have been way too many times when the Mets go through stretches like this during his tenure. And the way he constructs the lineup and in game decisions are baffling.I guess Im partially annoyed because the Mets had a great opportunity to hire two good managers in Maddon and Baker and didnt make a run for either.

8648917,0,t3_4ybvuk,Lets look at things this way the NL wildcard is still up for grabs. The Marlins the Cardinals the Pirates and LASF have been playing good baseball and gotten some clutch wins. The Mets have been playing terribly we all know that. Theyre playing like a team who is . games back in the division but they are  games out of a wildcard spot. Its possible. Its very possible. We just need guys to step up. Syndergaards homer was a small moment of hype in a miserable week but we all felt like it could have been the turning point. We wanted it to be the turning point. We want a Flores homer in the th. I dont think we get that this year. I think get a few weeks of consistently good baseball and BAM! Were there in. Wildcard spot. The pieces have to fit together.

8738377,0,t1_d6xtyg2,Just to quickly comment Cabrera hitting  more hrs in   extra PAs is the difference yet one is horrible and one is solid.More to the point this is a duda and loney comparison.  k rate was bad to average  october sept july june. Other months you can see in the stats the games in which he was fire then follows with another good game maybe even a rd then follows by   game stretch of inconsistent ability. Ks and at best a single in which no one here on this sub likes.  Loney half the k rate contact only  times this year has he gone with out a hit in  consecutive games  while duda has more    game stretches without hits last year.  There is already enough power on this team. Loney is exactly what you see contact moderate to better average than what we have and I rather a consistent hitter in the lineup that will get base hits and move along the sytem especially now that reyes is here and is on base and will score on base hits. ,NewYorkMets,d6xy3bq,-1,t5_2s7w9

Could the Braves have said f that we still want to play and Sundays game still would have happened? Or did MLB make the decision to cancel game?

9137891,0,t1_d8aabem,I can buy that excuse for dArnaud because his throws were excellent at the start of the season and after he returned off the DL but that could be a serious issue with his shoulder that rehab cant fix. Although Im significantly less worried about his ineffective catching and more concerned about his putrid swing mechanics and his evaporated power. His inability to throw out runners would be very easy to swallow if he even slightly replicated the hitting prowess he displayed in . Theres no way he can hit the ball with authority with his body twisting light years ahead of his hands.I really wish we got Lucroy because dArnaud just has too much risk and were at a point where we cant wait for a breakthrough. Im not going to be backhanded and say I still like the guy but... we really need to figure out what the future of our catching will be and Id prefer we not make it a duel between dArnaud and Plawecki and scramble for catching depth in case of a likely injury for Travis.,NewYorkMets,d8aalop,2,t5_2s7w9

I think this is his future.With Lugo and Gsellman looking like actual potential ML starters and PLEASE the possible return of Wheeler I wouldnt mind this. Of course wed need to have a lefty starter.

As the ball flys over the wall do you expect a sold out crowd to rationalize you know what Familia is still good these things just happen.  Hes been good for us and will continue to be next season.  Besides our offense didnt score any runs and that contributed to the loss as much as Familia did.  When you are in the stands probably some degree of intoxicated it is impossible to think clearly.  You just saw Familia serve up a  run bomb to a fucking nobody and now you are pissed off.  People take boos in the moment too seriously.

For all third basemen he wouldve been th by OPS considering only those that had at least  ABs or lower if you consider anyone who played third base. So above average you say? So if youre trying to answer the question of why would someone think David Wright should retire maybe research facts instead of spouting garbage that you think. If you want to excuse his stats by saying he was playing through injuries youre just reinforcing my point. His injuries arent a broken arm and a twisted ankle. They arent going away. I agree hes a great clubhouse presence. Did I say ban him from the team? Please dont put words in my mouth. A retired David Wright can spend just as much time with the team as an active David Wright. And about my offseason plan trading de Aza was a minor point in the entire thing. Yep I was wrong that he was still under contract. Big whoop.

I disagree with Alderson saying hes unwilling to trade any of the core four....the only one that would be absolutely off the table has to be Syndergaard for me because of how far away he is from free agency and the mega deal.If someone offers you a legitimate star quality player for HarveydeGrom or Matz a dude who can hit the ball for average and not just power and doesnt strike out a ton I think you have to do it. This team has the depth that we could lose one or two of them and still be fine...look at the end of last year from late July on we only had Noah and we still had I think the rd best rotation WAR in the National League. This team is absolutely getting slaughtered in games when they get runners on. If you can get a tried and true contact hitter for MatzWheelerLagares etc id be  willing to do it. You have to account for David Wrights highly likely continual decline...I think a lot of us would be happy if Wright plays  games this year.I definitely see your point Matz could be an ace for a team somewhere down the road....IF he stays healthylike how this trade for McCutchen could work out for us IF we get the McCutchen of old .,NewYorkMets,dbjkbws,1,t5_2s7w9

10217654,0,t1_dc25n2u,Yeah I have a lot more doubts about Plaw at this point because he doesnt have the raw tool upside that TdA does. TdAs raw power puts his ceiling way higher than a guy like Plaw who needs to prove that he can be the sort of gap hitter that got him up through the minors. Im not sold that hes able to do that against major league pitching. A catcher who can hit  dingers is a huge asset in todays game where catchers who can hit are a premium asset so TdA will at least get this season as a leash considering how valuable his upside is. Bringing back Rivera at . million pretty big for a backup catcher says a lot about what the organization thinks about Plaw at this point. If TdA staggers this year the Mets will need to go looking though unless Nido has a huge year in the minors.,NewYorkMets,dc288s4,2,t5_2s7w9
10223132,0,t1_dc2twzl,Nothing in that article says anything about giving up Cheech or Nimmo. They only linked to a Cerrone article where he talks about that possibility in trade options he suggested. Seeing as Cerrone is full of shit all the time there arent current negotiations where thet would have to give up a blue chip prospect to dump Bruce with for a crappy reliever. Thats insane. Mets could easily dump Bruce now for a fringy relief prospect but theyre trying to get a decent MLB piece in return for a for trade without taking salary but no team is biting. The Mets could settle low now to get rid of their human roadblock and not give up valuable assets eat Bruces salary to get a decent bullpen arm or attach a solid prospect with Bruce for a great high leverage arm which is an unlikely option from what Alderson has implied. Dumping Bruce with a blue chip prospect for a pile of scrap isnt a consideration on both the Mets and the potential trade partners ends.,NewYorkMets,dc2ukph,9,t5_2s7w9

This isnt a matter of the guys liking Terry or not weve established that. I want to know how Terry is responsible for Cespedes being there. How its Terry whos responsible for the morale being so high not the winning. Compare how to team looked mid season this year as opposed to when they were on the up in AugustOctober of . They were flat because they were losing. They werent hitting with RISP they were getting very visibly frustrated. Where was the Terry energy at that point? Like I said I know hes a nice guy Im not taking that away from him but you stick any likable guy to man the ship of a winning team and Im willing to beat the morale will be high doesnt make him a good manager. ,NewYorkMets,dccg275,0,t5_2s7w9

In the games he played he was actually the th best hitter on the team behind Cspedes Cabrera and Walker.gtIf we had say Conforto or Curtis from  we would have won the east.Sure but we didnt. If we had Daniel Murphy in  we would have won the East too. And if we had Mike Trout instead of Alejandro de Aza same thing. But we didnt. And we couldnt have. Because thats not how it works.gtDo you know how bad he will be this year?Realistically I dont see Wright playing more than a month this year. And I dont see Granderson as being our best CF or RF option by the end of the year either. I could see Nimmo and Conforto both being better by years end.That doesnt mean WrightGrandy have been black holes for the past  seasons since they havent. Youve been wrong about their performance wrong about their numbers and wrong about Grandersons health.But youre definitely right about us needing to improve moving forward over Grandy and Wright. The problem is we cant do it right this second because Wright will retire when he chooses to and Grandys there until or unless we trade him or his contract ends at the end of this season. So in that we agree completely. But there are some things a team cant do because its hands are tied.gtIts not talking shit. Its not being a analytical annoyance to justify delusion.It kinda is though. I never said I expected Wright and Grandy to be good in  you imagined that. I just said they werent as terrible as you thought they were .

10562820,0,t3_5r7s71,That Kevin Burkhardt interview on Joe amp Evan was so fun to listen. The interview occurred at the  AM slot. He touched on both football and baseball. Ill bring up just the baseball points.Key baseball Points  Burkhardt talked about how the whole FOX group prepared to discuss the plays that happened in last years postseason. ARod and Frank Thomas used notes before during and after each game while Pete Rose memorized every play. Joe brought up how the Mets werent good when Burkhardt was with the Mets and then when Burkhardt left the Mets end up making the postseason every year after. Joe described it as a nice bridge. Burkhardt praised Steve Gelbs and pretty much said to lay off the comparisons between Gelbs and himself. Evan brought up Mets legend I use those words loosely Alejandro De Aza going to the As and Burkhardt brought up the problems of not having many atbats. The conversation then briefly went into Flores. Burkhardt spoke a bit on Familias struggles in the postseason and believes that Familia is mentally driven to handle the postseason but says that Familia has to prove it.Id recommend listening to the interview if possible. It should popup later today on here Couldnt be any more happier for Kevin Burkhardt.,NewYorkMets,dd5eya4,1,t5_2s7w9

11593970,1,t3_65gwch,I dont disagree with resting bullpen arms but its too early in the season for that. You have so much time to worry about rest later in the year. You can call up pitchers from AAA use the waiver system or acquire relievers via trade. All in due time. We should be trying to win as many games as possible before real fatigue kicks in. These guys are fresh off a long winter. If were afraid to ride them right now what happens in the middle of the season? We just gonna forfeit games and pitch Edgin when things get tight? I would have liked to see a better effort to win this game against a division opponent. We didnt call up Gilmartin for nothing. Cya tomorrow,NewYorkMets,dga6nwx,2,t5_2s7w9

11619820,0,t3_65nuhv,As much as some TC moves make me fucking crazy is just as much as I love him. I cant imagine another available manager that could come into NY and get the results he has with some of the teams hes had. Yes he drives me crazy sometimes but the lack of real drama weve had coming out of the clubhouse and the winning that hes gotten is telling of how much hes respected by the players. Sure Id love to have a great in game manager. Those are probably taken and any up and coming manager is too much of a risk to take in the high pressure of the NY marketmedia. If anything the heir apparent Dick Scott needs to step his game up and start pressing some in game suggestions. Or maybe he has and hes Game of Throneing TC. ,NewYorkMets,dgd48jg,1,t5_2s7w9

11653150,0,t1_dggpkvr,Id agree with you if we were talking about the Reyes who was posting  WAR years every year. Sadly hes just not that guy anymore. He was good but not great last year. Hes two years removed from the worst season of his career and hes going to be  in a month. While its true he can still do something on the base paths hes no longer the guy who stole  bases three years in a row far from it. Personally I would make the move to Flores now but I would understand if they gave him another week or so. His upside isnt nearly high enough to justify giving him more than that though.Speaking of upside FWIW Wilmer may have the offensive upside of a top  B hes still only . Only way were going to find out what he is if he plays. And lets be honest were not losing anything even if he doesnt consistently hit righties. ,NewYorkMets,dggwdht,3,t5_2s7w9
11658021,0,t3_66cdkw,When is Collins going to get his mind out of  and realize what Reyes role is now? He was brought in as a superutility bench piece who played well enough to stay as Wrights placeholder. That hasnt changed no matter how cloudy Wrights chances of playing are. Reyes is not a permanent starter. If hes this ice cold he has to be spelled for a significant period of time to see what Flores can do. If Flores catches fire he gets bumped up to the top of the B depth chart. End of story. Nothing should be guaranteed for Reyes.,NewYorkMets,dghg95g,8,t5_2s7w9

11770719,0,t1_dgu89v1,The White Sox wanted pitchers not position players. Similar to the Tigers when they wanted Michael Fulmer for Yoenis Cespedes. Its the price you have to pay. Would i have given up Dunn and Szapucki to win now? Absolutely.... There is no long term in Baseball when youre a contender. This team isnt rebuilding theyre trying to win. As you can see with our pitching staff it doesnt get much better than that. But even they have concerns regarding health. Nothing is certain. You either go all in for a championship or trade your best players for prospects like plenty of teams are doing around the league. The Mets at least to my knowledge are not a rebuilding team. Theyre apparently trying to take advantage of this pitching staff and failing miserably by constructing a shitty offense.,NewYorkMets,dgu8qdt,1,t5_2s7w9

Those magnets are strong and Im guessing he doesnt want to be away from his hammer for long and that hammer probably contains some sort of magnetic metal.
