7011940,0,t3_480tjq,Ive been harping on this for years and they still havent updated the Android app to include a dark theme. I canceled my subscription and have left them  star reviews pretty much everywhere until they resolve this. Hundreds of people have been demanding a dark theme for years and Todoist ignores it.,todoist,d1b5fiu,1,t5_2ysq5

8214355,0,t3_4rtgmx,Its not possible to move the task to another day.I move tasks all the time. Instead of editing the date just use the schedulepostpone yellowcalendar icon button and pick another day. Or leave it as overdue and it will still show up in the  Today view. You might want to change everyday to after  day which is relative to when the task was completed rather than specific days.,todoist,d54ckpa,3,t5_2ysq5
8410419,0,t1_d5ssxqd,Yes and you should not be working more than  from your today view you should be working from your list of high priority items.As I understand they Todoist are working on a feature to allow custom filters in the top left section which will be great.,todoist,d5suhvl,1,t5_2ysq5
8725905,0,t3_4xqy7m,I dont have them directly interfacing but I set up time chunks in my calendar that refer to todoist labels. So Ill set up an hour in my calendar to do all my calls or an hour every day to bang through my quick today filter tasks tagged with min or min due today.,todoist,d6wdpch,1,t5_2ysq5
9204263,0,t3_562hdb,Priority gt time. All your priority tasks appear before ur priority tasks. And inside the same priority tasks they sort it using time again ,todoist,d8ipjc8,1,t5_2ysq5

9804680,0,t3_5fninz,I use it on android web and iOS. Indeed its vers easy to create subtasks on the web app. Between the  mobile platform I prefer android because of the quick add in the notification or as a quick settings tile. ,todoist,dalmyty,1,t5_2ysq5

10259005,0,t1_dc6ln47,gt fast syncExactly I often really just had to wait s so sync all stuff. I also had to manually check to remove all attachments the size of the database and if everywhere is the recent version of database. That was really annoying. Attachments were really attached to tasks so if you add big files then your database got big too. At the end the sync got slower and slower.gt start and due datesThats on of the only things I really dont get why Todoist doesnt want to implement. I asked them and didnt even understand what I mean. They said its already there. They mix start and due date and dont even have the intention to add it because it could confuse people I guess. At first I was very annoyed but now Im used to it and accepted it but I still sometimes think they should still add that.gt UWPIt stands for Universal Windows Platform. Apps from the Microsoft store are all UWP apps. On Windows you can use Todoist for Windows Desktop exe which is basically a wrapper for the web app but additionally with a shortcut in my case ctrlaltspace to quickly add a tasks anytime from anywhere. You can find it on this page and here the download link. Else you have the Todoist UWP app from the Microsoft Store which does work and has some cool features but overall I cant stand it and I dont use it. In comparison to the web app and Todoist for Windows Desktop its much slower less intuitive you have to do much more tapsclick it scrolls slower you cant zoom inout it cant even handle the Todoist Markup syntax properly quick add is not system wide available the sync is slower the ordering and counting is sometimes different  and some more issues.You can also use Todoist for Chrome which is a Chrome app. I personally created a Chrome Web app. I think its the best solution because it is blazing fast you can have several instances  you have all features from Chrome browser in it spell checking zoom itout CSS mod to change the design amp coloring of Todoist etc. it doesnt consume much resources in comparison to a tab in Chrome since you dont use the whole browser its just link a real app and not a tab it just shows Todoist and nothing content nothing else from the browser,todoist,dc6wxpy,2,t5_2ysq5
10287954,0,t3_5nai96,Yes after using todoist for a while you tend to notice how many of the  features that are not really useful or which really should be expanded Why cant I have per project setting for reminders? Or per label or per priority settings for reminders? Or have multiple reminders as default?. The only reason I stick with it is the API and that my wife is using it as well so we plan most of the housework recurring tasks dinners and holidays with it.By using the API together with googleCalendar I can put the deadlines of my tasks in my calendar. However this is not that beneficial since it might be just better checking todoist when things are due.I would really like to get a better workflow for how to plan your day using todoist. Right now I just do that with pen and paper while checking todoist it would be much better if there was a day planner where you could drag tasks onto a timetable which would also track how much time you spent on certain tasks and projects. I emailed them about this feature request a while back but I doubt it will happen. I have started hacking together something like this for me but it is not very polished.Sorry for the ramblingrant with no solution to your problem one way to do this is by using python and todoist API.First you would get all items from todoist filter those that have due dates and then use google calendars API to add those as deadlines.This is how far I have played around I do this each morning after checking todoist I do this mainly because my smartwatch has no todoist app and in my google calendar I have set default reminders to multiple different times based on due date.This will not work if you update an item in todoist it will then duplicate it and it will not sync. You could expand the script by using the synctoken and keeping a dictionary of all items so you can check which once are in need of an updated deadline I was thinking of doing something like that this weekend but in a way I would then have my own todo app built on top of todoist which is a bit weird.,todoist,dca71wx,8,t5_2ysq5
10436017,0,t3_5p3yx0,I might not have explained myself properly. Making a recurring task for Admin in Todoist is easy enough. But how do you guys handle tasks that should be DONE during the recurring admin session?As I mentioned in my OP I handle this now by adding them to a list called Next admin in Trello  and when then time comes I finish off that list.I guess I could have a project called Admin and add the admintasks to that without a deadline.Does anybody else do anything similar with batching up tasks?,todoist,dcqzqe2,1,t5_2ysq5

10682182,0,t1_ddhqjxc,First sorry for not being very specific. Dont get me wrong I already said Im not demanding or complaining I just want them to know about this. The windows  app is not useful why?  The app doesnt sync properly. like its kinda conflicted somehow shows up the completed deleted projects which are not supposed to be there. most of the time it takes even  Mins to launch also sometimes it doesnt even launch Randomly closes many timesIm still not blaming todoist for this I know they have some talented developers but I think UWP is not very reliable. Because these issues happen with other Windows UWP Apps too.gt They do update their legacy app Ive noticed beta updates about every  weeks and regular app updates about every month.Im not talking about that Im myself on the beta for both Web and Android. Im talking about the executable program itselfThe programapp .exe. it freezes itself and freezes other programs so I always have to force close it from task manager.Im really not complaining but personally I dont even want to use that Windows  app its UI and everything feels different. I like the old app but they moved to UWP instead of improving the old app. If its not possible to add the features as mac then thats absolutely fine but at least the could have made the legacy app a little stable.,todoist,ddhsbb2,1,t5_2ysq5
