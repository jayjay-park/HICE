8502705,0,t1_d63w7e4,I do know what youre saying but I just dont want orion after all of this legal shit to go back to doing the same shit. I dont want rudnik to get fucked over in all this because honestly hes the most sensible but like I stated orion is the only one that can fix his life. I first found HG when they did the drifting front wheel drive and all the stupid stuff they did made sense because they were still learning and were in the same position as me now. I just wish Orion could come to his senses. The guys that left are moving on with life but orion cam and Dylan arent.
