4510551,0,t3_3csrr2,Hey I really liked this and I really like what the song is saying! I have two problems with it though. The first is that you shouldnt switch between we and I and most people dont like having things assumed about them so I would make the whole song in first person. Second is the mirror mirror part which I just found a little odd fitting with the rest of the song. Maybe theres something I missed as to why its there. But overall good job keep writing! ,lyrics,csz7blk,2,t5_2qifs

Thats my process at least no one is ever good at writing lyrics their first try. I sure wasnt it required a lot of trial and error.,lyrics,cv2k8iz,3,t5_2qifs
