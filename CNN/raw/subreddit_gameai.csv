1031228,0,t1_chlhpzy,Wait so your world state has only actions? Does the goal state just hold the intended action? That seems to contradict the purpose of planning in general so I mustve misunderstood.I also dont quite grasp why actors dont have goals. A goal is any condition that an agent wants to satisfy. An agent may have any number of goals.   pg .,gameai,chli7yu,2,t5_2tq40
5738905,0,t3_3tqmdy,AFAIK theres no hard and fast definitions of these. Generally tasks tend to be lowerlevel and more directly enacted in the world. Its possible for a task to have subtasks but generally these would be directly related to the accomplishment of a single thing. Goals OTOH are higher level and generally more cognitively oriented. They may often contain and be contained in strings of goals and subgoals eventually terminating in tasks. So open the door might be a task not so much a goal. It could have subtasks of walk to the door and unlock the door but these are still specific to the task at hand.A goal might be get food which can be implemented or enacted by many tasks  some of which might include having to open a door at one point or another.All that said there are other differences between STRIPS planners and HTNs though theres a lot of overlap too.,gameai,cx8gtxb,3,t5_2tq40
7524688,0,t1_d2xbmyi,I wasnt talking about tools but about libraries. Its common to write libraries that perform a task without writing an accompanying tool to generate data for it because you might want to generate that data algorithmically or from a scripting language or from inside the game engine etc.,gameai,d2xiq1d,2,t5_2tq40

9074988,0,t3_54i347,This looks like youd want a really simple AI system not GANNsSimple behavior rules  state machine will do you absolutely fine and will allow you to have easily modifiable and complex behavior.Also I have no idea what Im supposed to be doing in your game other than shoot birds?,gameai,d82o02c,4,t5_2tq40
