57319,0,t3_1ure6e,I would say if youre already thinking about a sink tip line consider going with a full sinking line as well. Sink tips tend to follow the floating section of the line and can cause the streamer to rise making it harder to keep the fly at depth. While i love Rio lines Ive found that my favorite sinking line for big streamers is the Scientific Anglers Streamer Express which is designed by streamer guru Kelly Galloup. ,flyfishing,cekyfj4,2,t5_2qoeg

60555,0,t3_1upgi0,I own a  Fenwick glass rod that throws a weight pretty well and it is wildly fun to fish especially for smaller fish. Its a four piece too which is awesome. I love a medium to slow action when fishing for trout. It makes you slow down but also makes the average sized fish so much more fun to fight. It seems like you can just focus less on your gear and worry about your presentation.. my first ever brown was taken on the fenwick. He was about  and I had fished over the spot numerous times in the past. It is one of the fonder memories I have of fly fishing for a lot of reasons.The Cabelas glass rods are a real bargain right now too and getting one in a three weight is really tempting. Whenever I get around to building my first rod it will definitely be glass as well I want a clear blank with clear wraps ever since seeing one of the first Kabuto builds on TFM... just need to find a bamboo reel seat P.

636108,0,t1_cgbva83,There are two ways to access the river. One is very easy the other is easy getting down but the hike back up at the end of the day can be tough. Not brutal but youll get a bit of a work out.  They both access the same  mikes or so of river. Most people park at the fish hatchery walk down stream then fish back up. This is also the first access youll come to. He second access point is at the wild rivers section. You park ATampT he too of the Mesa then hike down to the river. The hike is about  minutes or so. When you get down to the river on this section it is a short hike downstream to the confluence with the rio grande. There are huge fish in the rio grande.  You can still access the rio grande if you park at the hatchery parking lot its just a longer hike.The red river is narrow. Maybe  wide and is classic pocket water with medium sized pools. As a result it really cant support that many people in a day. Quarters are tight. Youll mostly be fishing from the edge of the water or in the middle of the stream. As a result if you are not the first on the water you run the risk of fishing behind someone who has likely already fished and then walked through the hole that you want to fish. I was up there the last week in February and didnt see a soul but Ive been there in the summer where it was a constant race to the next hole. Regarding the Cimarron...call one of the shops in Taos to get a more accurate run down. I was thinking about my last email to you earlier today and realized that I forgot that the Cimarron is controlled by a dam so runoff may not be as big a problem as I said. Sorry I dont have more info on it but I rarely got there. I think the last time I went was about a decade ago. Its a great river but its just a tad too far for a day trip and if Im going someplace overnight Ill just go to Colorado or one of the other streams thats a bit closer. Hope this helps. ,flyfishing,cgckqoi,1,t5_2qoeg

If youre confident that the hook you are using is small enough try waiting a second or two after your certain the fish has taken the fly before attempting to set the hook. With panfish unless youre using a very light line  rod you should be able to set the hook by quickly raising the tip of your rod.

965286,0,t3_254zjv,I sometimes build by own rods and often heavily modify stuff I find to better suit my needs.  I have a heavy duty sewing machine and lots of leather working tools  so I tend me make bagspouches for fun.   My most recent project was making a UTG Tactical Messenger Bag into a fly fishing sling bag.   Base bag was around  on Amazon.  So far I love the results  more pockets and storage than my Orvis sling bag.   On the down side  it is not as comfortable and makes me look like some fly fishing SWAT nutjob. I sewed up a couple Velcropouches to hold floatant and other commonly needed items so that I dont have to open any pockets to get to them.  Added some eyelets to create a stringer for tippet spools.  A couple neodymium magnets to hold the nippers in place.  Foam amp velcro patches to hold flies that I can move around to several different spots or secure inside the main flybox pocket.   Enough room for  fly boxes depending on the size plus a leader wallet and random snacks and suncreen etc.  Plus a  oz water bottle!  Another pouch to hold my tenkara spools.  Also places to secure sunglasses case and a leatherman.   I made a matching fly rod sling bag so that I can take along my tenkara rods and not have to carry them.  Looks damn goofy but actually pretty comfortable and convenient.  In summary  anyone looking for a nice cheap sling bag you can build a pretty nice one for about   whatever time and material you want to throw at it. ,flyfishing,che0g5o,1,t5_2qoeg

They tend to push the fly underwater then eat it there where it cant fly away. This is why you should have a moment of pause between when the fish eats and when you set the hook.

1549795,0,t1_cjabm13,this post is also going to pertain to lake run browns and steelhead as they follow shortly after and the same techniques can be used. i cant speak to swinging streamers but i wouldnt discount drifting eggs and nymphs as crude technique that wont take much practice to be effective with. takes can be subtle similar to trout fishing and all of the same concepts apply correct amount of weight accurate presentations and tippet sizeleader. TAKE YOUR TROUT BOX WITH YOU. Nymphs can be just as important as all of the well known egg paterns when the fish get selective. my gotos are the oregoncheese colored globug with a blood dot beadhead estaz eggs in pink and blue and stonefies in the  range. all are pretty standard patterns because they work. With tightline tactics chuck and duck if you will weight is very crucial to get your patterns into the strike zone especially in some of the water that is bigger than the trout streams youve been fishing all summer. It can be tough to get globugs estaz eggs and the like deep without using a decent amount of weight. that being said you will detect strikes better and get better drifts if you use the least amount of weight possible. When i do use weight i make sure it can slide on a portion of the leader so the salmontrout feel its influence less on the line when they take flies and you can stay connected to them. its very important to stay connected to your flies if you dont plan on using an indicator. I use a  foot  weight with a leader in the  foot range. For tippet i usually stick to maxima fluoro green from  to  pounds depending on the scenario. HOOKS ARE CRUCIAL. Make sure you are using high quality hooks that are strong enough to handle  pounds of pressure maxima is stronger than it is rated on the package. straightening hooks on big fish sucks. This needs to be considered if you do delve into your trout box for nymphs the hooks also need to be kept very sharp bigger fish have harder bonier mouths. thats all i got for right now. i know there was a lot in there.,flyfishing,cjajgi8,1,t5_2qoeg

1669372,0,t1_cjpk1ad,Okay so Im not too sure the best entrance to get to Old Faithful the fastest but what I do know is you can trout fish the Yellowstone River in the park but Im not sure what other fees there are for fishing in the park. You should definitely take the Gardiner entrance on your way out. Youll have the Yellowstone River all the way to Livingston. Then from Livingston Bozeman is just a short journey away. Youll have the Madison and the Gallitan for some great trout fishing though the Lower Madisons water temperature is way up so I would advise from going there. I will contact some other friends tonight and tomorrow to find some bass spots. I assume youll probably be taking I from Sweetgrass and if thats the case youll be going through Craig which can be world class fly fishing. Its pretty technical there right now and youll have to have your Agame for that.However I have friends all over here and I can find a couple spots for bass. I mean most everyone comes here to target trout and thats exactly what Im big into but like I said I know of at least one spot in Bozeman and Im not sure for around here in Great Falls which should be on your way down there but somewhere between here and Old Faithful is some bass Im sure of!

1964192,0,t3_2guutq,I want to second the tight line tactics and throw in my two cents. Tight line nymphing is deadly especially with weighed nymphs. The key is a long light level tippet x preferably fluorocarbon so the tippet cuts through the water. If Im nymphing pockets or shorterfasterdeeper runs and heads of pools in the skinny water there is no better technique than the tight line. You can tight line the broader slower sections but you are limited to the length of the drift and how close you can get to the water you want to fish. For bigger wider runs and slower tailouts or even a seam I cant wade out to Id much rather toss an indicator and cover more water. Ive basically replicated my tight line rig and tossed a small thingamabobber on there and it is a very deadly indicator rig. For most water Ive got a  foot section of  lb berkley big game with a half inch white thingamabobber using  nail knots of clear fly line on either side of the indicator to lock the bobber in place and it lets you slide the indicator up and down your butt section of mono to adjust for depth if you have questions send me a pm. At the end of the lb mono I tie a clinch to a .mm tippet ring attached to  feet of x fluorocarbon. Then Ive got my first dropper tied off another tippet ring using a  inch section of x fluoro. From the same lower ring I tie a  foot section of x attached to my heavier anchor fly which gets changed based on depthspeed of run. Off the bend of my anchor I tie another  foot section of x to my point fly. Might sound confusing maybe Ill link to a drawing of whats going on! Remember good nymphing does not start with the right fly. Getting the nymphs down to their level on a good drift catches fish. Make sure youre ticking bottom before you start messing with different patterns. Its amazing what a few inches will make when getting it down to the fish. ,flyfishing,ckpvxs0,0,t5_2qoeg

2193330,0,t1_clim1rs,Actually plenty of brookies are being taken out of the Swift right now which is a good  hours from Boston between Ware and Belchertown.  The most notable brown trout fishery with catchandrelease regs is the Millers River which is further out than the Swift towns it runs through include Orange Athol etc.  That river system should prove to fish great these next few weeks if you can make it out.  The EB Westfield also has good numbers of browns.  Brown trout fishing should be good as their population sustains well into the fall.  There are great places to fish for browns and brooks farther away in Mass but your other option is to explore places in Connecticut.Take a look at millersriverflyfishing which is the best fly fishing resource for this area Ken Elmer posts weekly updates during the season about the Swift Millers and EB Westfield.   You simply wont find good trout fishing within an hour of the GB area.  Putandtake ponds get cleared out by spin fisherman and there are no substantial streams that are close by.  Your best bet is to make the trek out further west where catchandrelease sections of moving water are favorable to fly fishermen and good fishing in the fall.,flyfishing,climk1c,2,t5_2qoeg

It wont turn over as well as the leader however its quite a bit cheaper and bass arent nearly as fussy as trout.edit english n stuff,flyfishing,cpcmri2,0,t5_2qoeg

3606584,0,t3_31hwi6,This question has so many different answers and some great responses. I fish the Smoky Mountains primarily and there are trout in almost every hole. This past weekend I knew for a fact there were  good sized trout holding at the end of a pool. I had all but hit them on the head and changed my fly probably  times till I came back around to what I had originally started with. Your biggest and by far most important thing here is presentation followed by general size and color. I started to pay closer attention to my drift and noticed I was getting just a hair of drag. I fixed that issue and caught the biggest one in the bunch on the very next cast. Another scenario was also this past weekend just a different river. I had come up on a hole that I knew had to hold trout naturally I just start slinging shit in it expecting to pull one out. Didnt work. I slowed down shortened my casts dropped down to x and lengthened my tippet. I fished this hole for  before I decided to do this. Once I switched I pulled two out on back to back casts. Wade slow keep as little fly line out as possible use the lightest and longest tippet you can get away with and concentrate on your presentation. If you feel you have done all of this and nothing turns up I would move on. I feel this info is most relevant for small to medium mountain streams with lots of varying currents. ,flyfishing,cq3dkdg,2,t5_2qoeg

After the last Glacial period they were only holding on down here due to the higher elevation of the mountains and the old growth forests providing shade to keep water temps down.  Once those forests were clear cut the trout started to die off until rainbows were stocked.,flyfishing,cq4rj2h,2,t5_2qoeg

Do they go to the ocean? Yes they are steelhead. Theyre nonnative invasive steelhead but theyre steelhead. Whether or not theyre in their native range doesnt affect the name which is as Ive said to you multiple times based on a behavior. Just like Rainbow trout are still Rainbow trout in their nonnative range in New Zealand the Great Lakes etc. When they spend time in salt they become steelhead.In fact I mentioned these situations multiple times nonsea run fish populations will at some point all develop downstream migratory fish and if they have access to an ocean will eventually develop some sea run fish. Whether the conditions allow that population to flourish is a different story. Proof that the genetic argument that so many people fall back on is not viable. Migration is part of what Rainbow trout populations do no matter where they live. ,flyfishing,cqzf2s4,1,t5_2qoeg

We took a break as they pulsed the river and during this time it clouded up and started a light drizzle.  As the water subsided and we moved back into the river there was the most epic hatch of BWOs I have ever seen and it went on for hours on end and the fish were going nuts over them we were catching good numbers of fish on size  amp  thread bodied BWO drys.   After the second hour of this hatch the Sulphurs started coming off as well and the fish were now eating both.  We tied on size  Sulphurs and tailed it with a BWO  behind the Sulphur.  Even though they were eating both off the surface we had better luck with the BWO as they were refusing our Sulphurs way more than they were eating them.  Being low and slow water you would see these fish come right up to the Sulphur examine it for a few seconds and then turn away.   Was an exciting day to say the least.

All in all we caught five fish of notable size and I caught many many juvenile rainbows and chub when I switched to nymphs and dries. We had two rods my Orvis Clearwater wt and my Orvis Access wt.

5216468,0,t3_3meirr,Why is it wrong to call them wary? I dont think that word implies intelligence it just says theyre cautious of dangers. I actually think thats the perfect description of trout on heavily pressured waters. I dont think theyre aware that people are using fake food to catch them but its not unreasonable to think they could associate humans with danger. For example I sometimes fish the Swift River in MA an extremely heavily pressured tailwater. The fish there will swim up to your boots to eat the bugs you kick up whereas the wild trout I catch spook if youre anywhere near them. Therefore I think trout must be capable of learning something. If the Swift River fish clearly learned they could get food from peoples feet and that humans dont pose a physical threat i.e. they wont physically grab a trout in the water why couldnt they learn that eating is more dangerous when humans are around? They might not understand why its dangerous but I think they are aware of the danger.I do agree with agree with him that trout probably dont possess the mental capacity to be traumatized or live in fear. Though that being said everything he says about a trouts brain is pure speculation as far as I can tell. I dont think many studies have been performed on the mental capacities of trout and even then we can only learn so much. Its pretty much impossible to know how another species thinks.,flyfishing,cverz6q,1,t5_2qoeg

5898382,0,t1_cxsqwza,Okayudaniellinphoto I have not fished or heard much about the Airflo nymph line so I cant answer that. For some reason companies are reluctant to tell you what kind of taper these lines are being made with. For the record though Cortlands  grain line was the basis for the FIPS rule and Rios line was also made to spec so if you want to compete with it they should all be fine. Sunrays WCN nymph line is also to spec but the word through the grapevine is that theyre all advertising and no product.Also as far as lowno stretch goes most of those are done on braidcore which is horrid for nymph lines. You want the line to be stiff so a thick mono core works much better. For example the Cortland  line has a stiff  pound mono core with a outer coating made out of saltwater line material for maximum stiffness. I dont know for sure but Id be emailing airflo to find out before I bought one.udjvanillaface leader switching sounds good in practice but with loop to loop connections you get terrible turnover with small diameter lines. For that reason I use nail knots for leader to line connection and just use a separate line when need be. Thats the beauty of the nymph lines is that you can do  of your normal fishing with them while remaining a perfect nymphing line. Except for throwing big streamers I do all of my trout fishing with a wt line on a wt rod and have never wanted or needed a heavier line.If I had it my way Id be fishing a stiff monocore  foot triangle taper line with the first  feet at the minimum legal diameter. I want it to be thin while nymphing but when nymphing Im usually very close to my target. Having the triangle taper in the belly of the line would allow me to actually punch casts make incredibly small loops and mend like a maniac. Best of both words. In regards to splicing my own line Im going to try taking a ft section of monocore thin nymphing line and splicing it into a DT or triangle taper fly line to get that. Problem being that splicing works best when the main line is braided and having two different core materials could prove bad.,flyfishing,cxst871,1,t5_2qoeg

7002435,0,t3_4biiq5,I live in Vancouver and fish somewhere between  days a year in B.C. There are  Lower Mainland area rivers with decent Summer Steelhead runs however I wont be posting their names or info on them here. Vancouver Island has many many more opportunities to fish for Summer run Steelhead on systems far less fished but are typically more remote.Stillwater fishing for Rainbow trout is extremely popular in the Interior areas of B.C. in the summer and you stand a good chance to catch a few inch  fish in most decent Stillwater lakes.The sport fishery for Bull trout is also a popular destination fishery here with coastal area Bull trout averaging lbs some push lbs. Bull trout in Eastern B.C. rivers average about lbs with lb fish in most systems.If you want to venture up to the Steelhead capital of the world where fish up to lbs reside look no where else but the Skeena river and its Tributaries. Smithers Terrace area are a good starting point for reference. What it really comes down to is how much money you have to spend are you absolutely keen on fishing for Summer run Steelhead and how hard are you willing to work.,flyfishing,d1a2jzh,3,t5_2qoeg

7101617,0,t3_4ctkjn,I think there are two camps of thought on fly rods for beginners. The first is to get something inexpensive to learn on while you figure out your casting style and what kind of rod you might like fast slow medium. You might also be more likely to accidentally break one early on but anyone can close the damn thing in a car door at any time. The second is to spend the extra money if you have it and get a rod you can grow into. Plus you might have an eye for finer things and the money to spend. I dont think there is a wrong answer. When I got into bicycling I got an inexpensive bike and a couple years later got my trek madone carbon race machine. On the other hand when I learned to play guitar I didnt buy a used one but went straight for a stratocaster. Whatever you do try to cast them before buying and get one that feels right. ,flyfishing,d1lc9qt,2,t5_2qoeg

Cozumel is amazing and I would highly suggest spending at least  day fishing the flats there. Unfortunately I had to blind cast most of the day due to the wind but it worked out and I got super lucky and caught a permit as well.

8510766,0,t1_d65dvly,Man youre kind of sounding like a know it all. Obviously if it is raining it wont freeze. But if youve ever spent more than a few hours fishing the intermountain west youre well aware that the weather can go from raining and  to snowing and  within a half hour. And if youve ever been fishing during a brown and rainbow run and are constantly reeling and netting fish for an extended day youd know how impossible it is to keep your reel dry whether or not you dip it.Yes dipping your reel back in the water is always the band aid for a frozen reel. But it only makes the problem worse until you can dry it out in your car. Casting  times is enough exposure to lock that thing up just before you get a fish on. Which is why I asked about good reels and didnt seek advice on how to keep my reel dry.And FYI while not technically winter but it sure feels like it the last week of fishing in YNP each year sees  hrs of daylight if you really need a precise figure. Fishing before or after sunrise is illegal.,flyfishing,d65ehad,1,t5_2qoeg

I wear some my heavy thermals in winter time as a base layer since theyre not thermal waders.   I do suggest splurgibg a little on boots  I regret getting cheaper boots due to ankle support.

If you need a quick fix for leaders  you can tie up some out of monofiliment fishing like  I just buy Berkeley  big game since I like the green tint   it isnt the best but gets the job done when moneys tight.

9731499,0,t1_dachkmm,Theyre not wrong but the affect is often overstated. Trout feed based on their metabolism and since they are a cold blooded animal their metabolism fluctuates a lot. When its cold out they dont eat as much as when its warm out. After a certain point going up they start eating less as its dangerously hot. Theres also an interesting temp point where the fishs metabolism is going so fast that their diet intake isnt enough to keep up and in that instance the fish are eating everything with abandon but its a very stressful point for trout so I dont fish when its that warm. Now if the temps are anywhere between  and  and people blame it on the temp then its generally bullshit. Trout feed optimally at these temps even if it is slightly lower at colder temps. Below  fish are very lethargic and above  fish may still be active but youre inducing a lot more stress.   degrees is a common temp for many trout but different species have different upper limits.

10187528,0,t1_dbyreen,Theres definitely a huge learning curve to fishing from a kayak. You have to switch from being a fisherman to being a kayaker first and fisherman second. I started with spinning gear and baitcasting gear so I was familiar with fishing from the kayak. But casting a fly rod was a totally different beast. I think I destroyed  leaders from knots and tangles before I became proficient enough to cast without messing up. The few extra feet from standing up make a huge difference vs casting sitting down. Just cast for accuracy and not distance since you can always just move closer to the fish without spooking it. But those are minor issues compared to the waters that having a boat opens up and the convenience. I just leave my kayak on my car when its warm enough and will hit up lakes streams ponds rivers etc when I have the time. Up here in the middle of Vermont wadeable water only makes up like  of total fishable water here. Shore accessible water is even less since its either taken up my private property of steep granite cliffs and dropoffs. So it opens up a lot of new and interesting options. ,flyfishing,dbyt9k5,3,t5_2qoeg

10423064,0,t3_5p77ri,If you skip the Kenai youre doing yourself a disservice. Bummed to hear you wont be using guides as thats what I do for a living but the Kenai is prime time for sockeye salmon in late July and early August. Plenty of walk in fishing opportunities. Dry fly fishing is spotty at best on the Kenai fun as hell when its on but July and August its impossible to guess when it will work. But beads and flesh flies are solid. Guys above me are right. Fishing for trout in Alaska on the bigger rivers you need a  or  weight. You could get by with a  weight but if you want to have a fighting chance at catching one of those  plus fish thats in there you want a heftier rod. Fishing licenses available at most tackle shopsonline? Hit Mossys Fly Shop in Anchorage. Local favorite maybe not the cheapest but they can point you in the right direction. If you plan on fishing for Sockeye plan on using at least an  weight and ask someone to teach you how to floss for fish without snagging them in the ass every time. ,flyfishing,dcpiurq,1,t5_2qoeg

NO COTTONAlso two things you can do if your feet get too cold is move around more or fish shallower. Moving creates blood flow and thus warmth. Wading deeper means youve got water pressing more of your waders tight against your skin and smushing whatever insulation youve got under them. Water pushes down on it harder than fleece can push back reducing loftinsulation and making you colder. Get shallower if you need to get warmer. ,flyfishing,dd5dqsf,3,t5_2qoeg

11065269,0,t3_5y0drd,Wanted to share some pics from my weekend trip to North Georgia with everyone that answered some questions for me a few weeks back. I ended up fishing FridaySunday. Heres a quick summary for those looking for info.Day  Friday afternoon I fished Smith Creek. Water was low and clear and there were plenty of others out there. Everyone I talked to in the parking area seemed to have no success but I decided to give it a go anyway since I had just driven . hours North after working all week. You could see the fish everywhere in the water but they all seemed fairly spooked and were not quick to take a fly. I think this was due to the number of people fishing there and how low and clear the water was. I tried a bunch of small nymphs initially and had no luck. Finally came across a deeper run where the fish were rising and managed to catch  rainbows on a size  Adams. Day  On Saturday I had booked a guided trip with Reel Em In Outfitters. I was surprised that they were able to get me on the water with only  week notice. The guide Danny and I were set to fish the Toccoa and it was a cold morning. We started off fishing a small hole right near the parking area that was extremely productive and then hit quite a few more areas before the end of the day. A little after midday Danny mentioned that we were at  fish and I was shocked. I knew we were catching a lot but I was so focused on the next drift and just enjoying the weather that I wasnt keeping count. By the end of the day we figured we had caught just over  rainbows and a couple of suckers. It was truly a phenomenal day of fishing on Georgias public waters and a great experience for my first guided flyfishing trip. Day  Woke up to  degree temps and was ready to hit the water. Decided to give the Amicalola a try and was on the water by . Started fishing some bigger runs with no luck and then decided to switch to smaller holes. I had to drive back down to South Georgia for work the following week so I only had until about  pm to fish. By that time Id caught  or  rainbows on small pheasant tails and frenchies.Overall it was an awesome trip and a good getaway from the cold and snow of Central NY. Really hoping that work sends me back down again so I can give it another go. I wanna give another shout out to Reel Em In Guide Service  I had an awesome day and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking to head to the area. ,flyfishing,dem8kit,4,t5_2qoeg

11251436,0,t3_60l9k2,I fish during runoff quite often. I would say focus on the edges of the river. The high water will make pockets along the banks that the fish will hold in. Make sure you comb those spots well if the water is discolored. Youll have to hit the fish in the face more or lessAs for flies I like stoneflies and San Juan worms and other high visibility flies. Normal match the hatch stuff works too though. Really its less about the fly selection and more about getting your fly in front of the fish. They still eat plenty during those high water times its just harder to present a fly to them consistently. ,flyfishing,df7c0ve,2,t5_2qoeg

11511164,0,t3_64afzd,For a wt in TX Id be looking for a warm water floating line with the shortest possible head I could get. I keep wondering when somebody is going to offer something like the equivalent of a short skagit shooting head in a floating version for bass. The reason I say that is that my motley collection of Sci Anglers and Rio lines tend to have  heads yet to be honest sitting in a kayak or canoe I rarely get that much line out of the guides. The reality is more like a  cast and that includes leader and tippet meaning that there may only be  of fly line in play. Even with the rare  cast  of that is leader. There is basically no situation in bass fishing where Im realistically getting a  head out of the guides. Currently my favorite wt bass line is Sci Anglers Redfish WFF. Thats not to say its best just what Im using. Its got a ft head and is available as a warm water line. If I could find one with a  head that was affordable and hot environment rated I might well switch to it. Alternatively I have considered going back to double taper line and just cutting it in half to have two lines for the cost of one. If I did that the running line would just be something like Berkley Trilene big game mono which is cheap. ,flyfishing,dg0sj19,3,t5_2qoeg

Steelhead do occur in AK though from the Aleutian chain southward.  Bristol Bay has great rainbows but dont really qualify as steelhead.

You really just need a couple plastic discs or washers cm of cord and  small carabiners.I used thick shoelaces in my first attempt  lesson learned there dont use anything that absorbs water and doesnt dry quickly. Ive since used parachute cord and bungee cord  both of those work fine. I also found some stiff rubber tubing thats just the right diameter to go inside the spools Rio for me usually and over two strands of cord and I like that design  the spools dont spin as much and theyre quieter.Ive tried clips and spring hooks and key chain rings but I keep coming back to the little biners. Theyre secure enough and they make it easy to pop the contraption on or off a vest pack lanyard whatever.Depending on how much random crap you have lying around your house you might be able to build one of these pretty much for free  and build it as big as you want.,flyfishing,dgmmz6y,2,t5_2qoeg

11793144,0,t1_dgwp7xa,I live in Norway. We have a very small fishermen to fish ratio. Aside from salmon fishing which draws a lot of tourists I have never heard of anyone doing catch and release. With so many lakes and rivers our fish populations are quite sustainable on their own. In fact in our northernmost county inhabitants are allowed to fish for free without a licence and theyre allowed to fish with nets as a way to acquire food. The fact that such a practice is sustainable illustrates how ridiculously unnecessary catch and release is to maintain the fish populations. That being said if you fish here and arent planning on eating your catch I dont mind that prople release the fish but do proper catch and release that doesnt hurt the fish at least.  ,flyfishing,dgwsjnz,5,t5_2qoeg
