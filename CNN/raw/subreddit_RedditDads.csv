In his case he was a csection and i guess when they are born that way they dont get the fluid squeezed out of their lungs like they do with a regular birth. It was worrying seeing him hooked up to all the equipment and having to split time between him and mom was hard. However after a while on O and IV he eventually got the fluid out and has been fine since. Hes  weeks old now and has shown no signs of issues since then knock on wood.

311022,0,t1_cfcytsx,Ok i find this unacceptable lets try to get you to  understanding otherwise i feel like a failure. I am going to try to explain it in very simplistic terms for everyones benefit so dont get offended.Lets say that I am Dr.Robotnik and evil maker of bots. I decide that I am going to create a bot that will destroy redditville by downvoting every single post it comes across. Now think that i created million of these bots you can see the potential damage I could do to the karmaverse. Lucky for us redditors the benevolent admins have thought of this problem and created a system of automated defenses for redditville. These automated defenses look for patterns in downvotingupvoting and postings that are an indicator that a user is actually an evil bot. When the system detects this kind of activity it makes it so that users votes dont count towards a posts or a comments total score however the user gets no notification that this change has happened. So the bot can then go around downvoting everything oblivious to the fact that is having no effect on the karmaverse whatsoever. Well now all of a sudden Dr.Robotnik realizes something is fishy so he tries to look at the score totals of the postscomments the bot has downvoted. Well the benevolent admins have thought of this too. So they go in and fuzz the count of upvotesdownvotes that way when Doc looks at them he cant actually tell if his bots upvotes counted. They may fuzz the count but they dont adjust the point total. For example lets say that you post something and it gets  downvotes and  upvotes for a total score of  pts. When you look at the total of upvotesdownvotes it may say  up  down up  down or it may even fluctuate the displayed point score when you refresh the page. Even though it may look like the points have changed the total that the user receives towards their karma total has not changed at all on what the damage or positive effect to their account is.Basically the system is designed to fudge the numbers on the front end to confuse and confound evildoers without altering the actual hurt or benefit to the end user on their karma totals.Hope this helps,RedditDads,cfd07wo,3,t5_2yul2

I hope to catch some of you guys tonight on the ps.  Its true you have to pay a fee akin what xbox  owners hadhave to pay.  I paid into the xbox  membership for about  years.  I regret nothing.  There were definitely perks being on xbox live that I dont see on the ps. The free games make it well worth the PS Plus membership.   Resogun is like the old school Defender game jacked up on HGH hormone supplements and was free to download  so much fun and a nice sample of what the next gen can potentially do  graphics wise.  You also get free different games for the PS as well with the Plus membership.  You keep the games as long as you have a Plus membership.  Its still too early to tell but I think the Plus is better than xbLive.  ,RedditDads,cfp9nzh,1,t5_2yul2

Press start go to host a job buy all ammo then back out of the job.   Use the impromptu racing feature during missions to liven them up.   If there are weapons you dont use drop them.

903023,0,t1_ch6wiyq,I think everyone is cool with using a tank to kill a tank griefer who is destroying the lobby. Pretty much any other use of a tank is a bit of a grey area.Although Ive defended our unnamed crew member in this thread tanks are definitely a bit lame to bring out in other situations. My main concern with the OP is that different crew members have wildly different ideas about what is lame. For example I have heard crew members say that going off radar after being killed is worse than getting in a tank. Should we be calling out people who go off radar? People who use Buzzards? Rooftop snipers? As an example I was involved in a long battle last night with a bunch of crew members against some randoms. At one point Id fallen behind and went to the helipad so I could catch up to them everyone had gone over the hills to the north. The only helicopter was an Annihilator. I caught up with everyone and then was thinking well Ive got to be careful not to shoot the randoms with the Annihilator or I might get a thread made about me and Ive only got it so I could get back to where everyone else is. Better parachute out of it now to make sure. Feeling like Ive got to watch exactly what I do to avoid getting rebuked on the subreddit is kind of a downer imo. All this could be easily avoided by having a proper discussion perhaps the mods do it in private first about what exactly constitutes rule  doucebaggery which Ive suggested in this thread but not had a response.,RedditDads,ch6xg6g,1,t5_2yul2

After the cost of ammunition there is barely any profit on most missions and free roam simply costs money.I dont mind putting my hand in my pocket every once in a while and for one thing this game isnt really Pay to Win like other FP games.  However when the economy penalises fair players and rewards griefers and glitchers there is less of an appeal to Shark Cards.  Why should I pump money into the game if a chunk of it is going to go on paying for my own car being blown up by someone in an OP tank who more than likely has never bought a Shark Card.,RedditDads,chhkxdt,2,t5_2yul2

2543436,0,t3_2otz6d,I used to work at an Urban Outfitters in L.A. on Melrose Ave. At the time Melrose had a bit of a homeless problem. There was a particular homeless man who used to frequent our store and he was a known trouble maker. He had on numerous occasions walked into our store with lit cigarette in mouth barefooted inebriated etc. Hed even been known to occasionally nap in our housewares section. The man obviously had some serious mental health issues. One afternoon my manager and I were folding some shirts near the entrance and greeting people and we saw this guy walk in shoeless and lit cigarette in mouth. We both gave each other the ohhh fuck not this guy look. And just as the guy walked behind me without breaking his stride he punches me square in the left side of the head and without word walks out of the store. I am completely shocked it didnt hurt a whole lot it was just mostly surprising. My manager freaked out and called the police. The police stop at my store and notice the man is across the street at the Starbucks harassing their patrons brandishing a pocket knife.

4246318,0,t1_cs3pcxw,Last night my team was able to beat him.  Instead of placing the bubble right in front of the door I placed it a littlbit forward and two the right I stood next to those little barrels just next to the door and that allowed the guys to stand on either side of the bubble to get the weapons buff and to stand inside when synthing for heavy.   I went up farther to the upper platform and Skolas ignored me the entire time in favor of the other guys.  So I unloaded  Gjallarhorn shots into him.  The other guys got off  shots each.   It was our third attempt...  if we didnt beat him just then we would have switched to the sniper method to see what would happen.  But I was the only one with an ascended BlackHammer so Im not sure how that would have gone.  HeapsofBeepsLP looks like you guys finished it as well.

6358872,0,t1_czcdyai,hah! I really dont think it will be like Destiny at all. I mean according to all I have watched and read the game has one load time which is when you start. There is crafting loot all over the place the pvp is way different as in its like patrol in Destiny but the other players can kill you along with the pve stuff there. As for AI I dont know if you watched that full  min or the video that guy put up where he was level  but they are much better as you get further in. Most of that  min gameplay here the enemies they were fighting were all low level so maybe thats why they are dumb. I think even if its only on par with Destiny it will be new so I will be playing it for another  years just like I have been with the D. ,RedditDads,czcflku,1,t5_2yul2

6953120,0,t3_4atpjh,Corporal punishment rarely works for stuff like this in my opinion father of three and I feel I need to qualify that by saying I am not opposed to corporal punishment when used correctly. I will give them a swat on the butt if they are doing something dangerous to convey the urgency or if they are openly defying me or having a tantrum to snap them out of it. You have to use it sparingly though or it will lose its effectiveness. The best for bad words in my experience is to ignore it andor shame them by saying something like you know that words like that are naughty I thought you were a good girl with a really disappointed face or something like that. Laughing is the worst thing you can do since it reinforces that those words are funny. Unfortunately it doesnt work overnight but if the kid figures out that those words have no power in the house they will stop using them.  At daycare the provider is going to have to take a little more responsibility on whats going at her place especially with something like this. I also cant imagine her firing a client after immediately losing a client over something as innocuous and normal as this.

A suitable one would be annual goat racing similar fashion to the Melbourne cup but instead of horses there are goats racing. No riders of course but the goats chase after a carrot similar to dog racing. This will be a family day where children can come and learn about the core values of your charity.

8587946,0,t3_4xc0is,I repaired my second major appliance last night.  My yr old Maytag French DoorBottom Drawer Refrigerator stopped working on Wednesday Night.  I got home from the grocery store and noticed the control panelwaterice dispenser on the front of the fridge was off.  If you pressed the buttons the panel lit up but they wouldnt stay on.  The lights came on in the fridge but the compressor never came on.   After a little internet research I determined that it was most likely the HV Control Board think Motherboard that was broken.  Its a  part and is not returnable after its opened according to the parts store I talked to the next morning.   So I debated whether to gamble  on the part there was no way to know if it would fix my problem until I tried it or save it as part of an investment into a new k refrigerator.    I went ahead and bought the part.  Had to wait about six hours for it to be delivered to the store. And installed it.  After spending the next  minutes looking up how to program the damn thing after installing the board I had a working refrigerator again.   Then I threw out everything inside and my wife and I sanitized the entire thing inside and out.  I know more about Refrigerators now than Ive ever wanted to.,RedditDads,d6f2yii,3,t5_2yul2

Were about helping one another out not pissing in each others pocket so its expected that youll assist your crewmate rather than try to disrupt their activities for your own gain.However as uADozenDone pointed out if you come to agreement with the other goats in the session to exchange bullets before rounds start flying thats fine  just dont be dicks to one another.,RedditDads,d7tq3kd,3,t5_2yul2

9144701,0,t3_55j140,I dont like giving parenting advice but you opened this up to all of us for feedback so here it goes...There are a lot of problems here. You undermined and contradicted your wife which undermines her authority as a parent. Its a Pandoras box if she undermines you in the future youve really got no ground to stand on. Youve also taught your son that diapers are shameful instead of being a tool for people of all ages who are incontinent even temporarily. If you have elderly family members who use Depends or if there are special education students at his school in diapers this attitude could lead to bullying or even elder abuse later in life. Thats my biggest problem with this as I personally know autistic kids who battle incontinence. Finally if he is ever hit with dysentery or prolonged diarrhea he may have to wear a diaper which hell now refuse to do.It sounds like you feel the need to make sure your son is a man but this might have been the wrong battle to fight.,RedditDads,d8b5mxy,2,t5_2yul2

11490323,0,t3_63wbm7,Just wanted to vent for a second...My fiancee is driving me up a fucking wall. We recently got engaged and we made an agreement not to start planning anything until after my sisters wedding in  month. Reason being my parents havent yet met her parents my mom is heavily involved in my sisters wedding and will want to be involved in mine. Which Im all for Ive never planned a wedding before Ill take all the help I can get. And though my fiance agreed to this... she simply cant follow it. Every single day she is STRESSED THE FUCK OUT over planning this wedding. Keep in mind we havent even really set a date yet. Arbitrarily it seems like its going to be FALL . And yet she thinks she has to get everything done and sealed NOW or else... well shit. I dont know why. But her fucking friends aint helping at all asking her if we set a date found a venue etc. etc. I tell her to tell them just plan on Fall  and were not setting anything in stone after my sisters wedding. Simple enough right? Nope. UNFUCKINGACCEPTABLE.So I tell her look... if you want to check out venues and start eliminating them. Go for it. Refine your guest list. Knock yourself out. But me Im not doing a fucking thing until my sisters wedding is over in  month when I can tap into my moms knowledge and wisdom without driving her fucking nuts. Then it devolves into the fact last night I was playing Mass Effect for  hours which is not common for me... but neither is having a free night to play video games for  hours in the first place instead of helping her... well I have no fucking idea. All she was doing was going into full on meltdown over the phone with her mom about venues and... yeah. Fuck that shit.
