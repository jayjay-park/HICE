I have a startssl certificate and usernames and passwords are entered on a ssl login page. Visitors may request a voucher from the office that are good for  hours or for  week.

1017869,0,t1_chjz9lc,Thanks for clarifying. I understand what youre saying and I do think that its a legitimate concern.But if I can put together a Google Site that is at least relatively attractive easytonavigate and provides easy access to valuable information Id consider it a win for now anyway.There is money available but not enough to hire professional web designers to develop a custom site I think. More along the lines of a Sharp SchoolEdlineSchool Fusion kind of service. And with those it still will only be as good as the design we choose and the content we put up.Ive been pushing Google Apps for Education heavily at this district. It has worked very well with the staff and students. Multiple Chromebook carts are available and the students take advantage of global access to their files and the great collaboration features.I figured leading by example with a Google Site will dovetail nicely into me providing training to staff on how to create their own classroom Google Sites. And since they all have GAFE accounts already managing site editing permissions on a perpage level is very easy.Im hoping people will be less likely to think oh they cheaped out and went with a Google Site and instead think wow thats not halfbad for a Google Site and view it as a costeffective choice. Making the most of limited resources etc.But if you do have some suggestions for improvements within the confines of the limitations of a Google Site I do want to hear them. And I do appreciate your existing comment because it is something Ill have to keep in mind.,k12sysadmin,chjzlt6,1,t5_2wnyn

2172626,0,t3_2jx1yp,We dont use iBoss so I am not familiar at all with the setup.  But we use AirWatch wDEP amp Apple VPP.For our MS iPads these are shared between students.  We use a Apple ID for each classroom  team.  At which point we tell AirWatch to save the Apple ID.  Hint it only saves it for  hrs.  During that time frame we can push any app we purchased through VPP to the account  device.  If a device fails to download the app it is as simple as clicking Install on the console.AirWatch also provides an App Catalog on to each device so the users can install apps to the device as well.   of the time it works extremely well.We also give the classroom  team apple id amp password to each teacher that has the corresponding set.  In addition each device is configured to change its profile based on who logs in.  If a student logs in they get a restricted profile.  If a teacher logs in it is more open.  AirWatch handles the check in  check out of devices directly.  This allows the teacher to install apps directly to the devices as they see fit.  And prohibits the students from removing the apps when they use it.,k12sysadmin,clfzqqf,2,t5_2wnyn

When used with a nonCisco phone system there will be some differences in functionality. First InformaCast will not send broadcasts to nonCisco phones. InformaCast will send broadcasts to computer desktops digital signage analog overhead paging systems InformaCast compatible IP speakers email and mobile phones via InformaCast Mobile. To trigger a broadcast from a nonCisco phone system a SIP trunk must be configured between the phone system and InformaCast.

6426922,0,t1_czfy46c,onenerdyguy thanks for the detailed answer.  This is the first response that actually helps me understand why my ideas may not be so hot.  A few followup questions though.gt Your plan for wireless will fail. Consumer grade network equipment does not support the density of enterprise. You need an AP that can handle  concurrent users on a mediarich website. Your off the shelf Dlink will not handle this. I have tried it. It will fail.Same thing everyone else is saying and I believe that you tested it.  But even within the consumer space there is range of highend and lowend.  Same goes for commercial grade stuff.  Is there really a hard line between topshelf consumer grade and lowend commercial grade?  There certainly appears to be in terms of price but I suspect in terms of performance the line is actually quite blurred.  That means there may be opportunities for a value play.  And to be clear I wasnt thinking about a bottombarrel DLink but a highergrade device such as the Asus RTNU.  So say the commercial grade device supports  simultaneous bandwidthhungry users and costs .  Does that mean the higher end consumer device at  supports only . or less users?  For the sake of argumentand ignoring the additional management overheadif the  consumer device supported  or more concurrent users then you could simply install x as many of those and have more capability at the same cost.gt your idea of just throwing it on a Raid shows you have minimal experience with virtualization since the IO of VM loads will destroy that.So a virtualized pfSense instance suddenly causes a dramatic increase in disk IO compared to the exact same instance running on bare metal?  Hows that?  I proposed the VM layer only to make a convenient container that would allow the pfSense instance to easily be migrated to another device not to actually run multiple VMs.  Though I later did suggest possibly adding a virtualized Windows Server instance alongside the router instance.  But I know the workload would be barely more than login authentication so again I dont see where this massive IO load would come from.  And for pfSense specifically you can use the nanoBSD version which is designed for diskless systems anyway.gt The issue is when it breaks you have potentially  warrantys youll have to deal with compared with just calling a single vendor and having them RMA it.Agreed.  But the particular servers I was thinking of using are donors long out of any kind of warranty anyway.  Thats why I was going to build two identical ones to backup each other and keep a third on hand for spare parts.gt A RMA mind you that will more than likely be handled x faster than consumer level as enterprise support tends to be quicker.Your experience with enterprise support has clearly been better than mine.  gt If I was a part time MSP or volunteer doing this it would be a pure MS environment setup to Microsofts best practices. Why? Cuz if I get hit by a bus or dont have time anymore anyone off the street can step in and support it.And that seems to be the crux of everyone elses arguments as well.  This to me implies that the kind of skillsknowledgeexperience I have isare unusual.  Because if I get hit by a bus theres apparently no one out there who can make sense of my setup?  But...gt Frankly I see half of the suggestions youve got up there as something Id see on Linus Tech Tips. thats not a good thing....So there are other people thinking the same way as me so it cant be that rare.  But apparently its judged to be bad thinking. ?gt Youre heart is in the right place. Ill give you that.Thanks.    Maybe the error in my thinking is like this in my line of work its been a decade of highly customized typically selfbuilt very lowlevel implementations.  The trading environment demands this kind of specificity.  But the school is unlikely to need such degree of sophistication and is therefore likely best served by generic or commodity solutions such as what the current consultant is providing i.e. offtheshelf commercial grade products designed more or less for the schools exact use case.  Which I get but is frustrating because I feel like it limits my ability to contribute.I guess another way I look at it is this at work everything is built with a specific purpose in mind.  So the solutions we deploy are tailored specifically to the problem at hand.  That makes them theoretically optimal.  So I have a desire to similarly create an optimal solution for the school.  But these generic solutions cannot be optimal else they wouldnt be generic.  So thats quite frustrating to me knowing what they have in place is likely suboptimal.Back to the wireless example Im certain no one at the school has actually done a study of what kind of wireless requirements they really have.  Everyone here keeps saying yeah but the consumer stuff doesnt support X concurrent connections.  OK but how often does that really happen?  I honestly dont know.  What if the wireless requirements actually are quite modest and a few DLinks would be sufficient?  At some point its like saying I dont really understand the distance or terrain of my commute so Ill buy a Humvee when in reality a bicycle would be sufficient.,k12sysadmin,czk2xsv,1,t5_2wnyn

Im just worried about them because their firmware can be flaky and often feels like beta. Its been a couple of years since Ive used their product and never did get zero handoff to work. Id be interested to hearing about how it works in a production environment.gtIm interested in their products but it seems like a  gambleWe started with a few Unifi AP LRs a few years ago to replace a few cheap consumer APs in a school with about  students. Since then I have bolstered the network with a few Unifi AP ACs and have covered another  student campus with  of them and have had no notable issues.We dont have  we have about  laptops per campus as well as student and staff networks on their own vlans with appropriate filtering via our Merakis.

8867845,0,t1_d7dqp3d,gtThe Mac OS is powerful and most importantly reliableI think Macs having some sort of mystical reliability is the real unfair stigma.  I most often see it from people who switched to Mac a decade a go and havent really used a Windows computer since.  Any decent modern computer these days runs pretty damn good.I have to reboot my Macbook every week or two because it slows down to a miserable crawl.  I havent rebooted my Windows desktop in months.  Ive also had issues with wifi being super slow while everyone else in the room on a Windows computer is doing great.

9477977,0,t3_5al8yy,We use Finalsite. Its okay. Only a few gripes come to mind quickly Their data exchange with other systems isnt very good. Its easy to get data in but hard to work with after that. Classic roach motel.   If you want AD login they expect you to expose LDAP to the Internet. lol no   If you want PowerSchool SSO they expect you to expose your Oracle DB to the Internet lol no Their SMS alerts use emailtosms gateways. Users cant change their carrier after adding a phone. No fullsite  in . Their SSO with Naviance breaks pretty regularly for us. Im very glad Im not using their other SSO bits like our marketing team wanted in order to drive traffic to the site.Before that I used iModules. They sucked pretty hard.  No fullsite  No way to control what pages you expose to robots via sitemap.xml. No way to get a complete overview of what pages existed on your site. This became a nightmare after we had a redesign done. Depending on what Google result you hit you might find yourself on our old site before the redesign reading very outdated information. To workaround one of our staff had to find amp disable the outdated pages manually. Their email delivery methods are not dmarccompliant. It was a big headache and their tech team was fairly behindthetimes when I tried to explain it to them.All that said Im glad Im not selfhosting.

Sometimes the ruckus wireless networks will completely drop all chromebook clients dell and lenovo and hp but windows machines with the same network card work fine. By the time we get that fixed the aruba networks will decide to forget that certain chrome devices are proxied differently due to being  and filtered differently etc etc.The rules that we have found seem to helpghz Only SSID broadcasting for chromebooks only. Wpapsk with aes or wpaent with peap preferred. If you cant do this then try and tell band steering to prefer ghz and set the timeout to  or  instead of . Good luck. These things are the bane of my existence there is just no telling when they are going to go haywire and google is completely unhelpful in either support or even their patch notes.    If you have the automatic updates turned on it might just fix itself till it breaks again later on.

11080379,0,t3_5xvnop,The channel selection process on GHz depends on your channel width.  If youre using   or  will depend how many and what channels you should use.Whether or not you do manual or automatic channel selection depends greatly on the WiFi solution you go with.  Aruba Aerohive Cisco etc. have fantastic automatic solutions.  However if you have older infrastructure or cheaper solutions like Ubiquiti you will definitely want to manually assign channels.Keep in mind that if you do manual channeling you need to do a site survey.  Dont blindly assign channels in an alternating pattern as RF does not work that way.,k12sysadmin,deny8wn,1,t5_2wnyn
11093897,0,t3_5yf29m,I would like to tell you I positioned myself and my career trajectory to move into a IT Director role but that would be hogwash.Ive been in IT professionally since about . I started doing tech support and backend web development not entirely true my real start was in high school when I started writing LSP GUI modules for AutoCad both at the school and local manufacturing facility but a story for another time. Moved into full servers and networking after and as the years went on and I gained more experience in more than just technical things I started supervising people. One day I woke up and I was doing budgets managing staff and touching hardware less and less.I did it quite organically which is how I do most things career related. I studied Architectural design in college and I never planned on being an IT pro. But I have been graced with a natural affinity for tech for some reason.If you want to move into a Director role especially in the education field I suggest absorbing as much tech as possible but definitely focus on soft skills business management and the education side of things more.Once you hit this level it is less about IT and more about solutions to educational problems through technology. My day to day has little to do with what hardware software servers switches etc. are running in the district and more how do I work with the elementary school faculty and admins to support our students?At the end of the day our mission is to provide the best advantages we can to students so they can learn. If that means iPadstablets great if that means pencil and paper thats great too.We exist to empower student learning not to push or manage technology we have staff to make sure nuts and bolts work. We do that by supporting the teachers the admins the staff and the students directly. Sometimes what we do is very nontechnical. You have to learn how to do that. IT pros especially this newer generation always want to push this or that tech thing. Sometimes that isnt the answer learn to recognize that.Also you can bitch and moan all you want about tech illiterate users but at the the end of the day some teachers dont want tech at all and that is fine. They are there to empower students we are there to make sure they can do that. If that means answering the exact same question  times a semester you do it and do it with a smile.I spend my time meeting with teachers and admins writingediting policies and procedures wrangling a budget and answering a lot of questions. I hardly ever tell anyone how to do something or what tech they should use. I listen and provide feed back on what they want.As for the ITinfrastructure side well that is easy. You build a scaled robust network and server back end the best you can with the funds you get. We settled on HyperV four node cluster because we have always been a Windows stack since before I got here  years ago and long before that as well. We were Windows on VMware I didnt like the cost of VMware licensing so I went HyperV  R in the last refresh. We were com switches we went Cisco. Ill be looking at something else soon. Cisco is costly for what we need and there are great alternatives out there now.These issues though are a fraction of what my team and I do. That is the easy low hanging fruit.I always like to remind myself that education and learning exists without technology. Technology augments learning. If I took every PC out of the building math would still be math. Social Studies and History would still be SSH et. al. We simply help students with that by giving them access tools and experiences.Were one of the top rated public PK schools in our state. My department and I contribute to that success by knowing when to be there and when to get the hell out of the way. We also contribute by focusing on people and not tech.,k12sysadmin,depheqf,11,t5_2wnyn

Happened three times in about a month two times I ended up restarting the rocket.  The first time support said since I restarted it there really wasnt anything they could do.  Second time I waited about two hours for a call back it was early here .  They said one of the services had stopped.  They restarted and all was ok.  Third time I waited for about an hour restarted called in again saying this was the third time same issue.  There reply was they created a script to restart the service if it happened again...Archiving side.  We moved to Office  about two years ago.  Archiving worked fine with Groupwise but since Office  we keep having corrupt email causing the rocket to quit archiving.  Ive got  journal accounts with  GB of mail that has not been archived.  Ive been working with someone at the company Lightspeed sold offspun off their email archiving to since January.  I just created a new user last week out of fear that the rd account would be full after spring break.

So staff are on ltmaindomaingt.org students are on ltmaindomainampmascotgt.org for emails. This was fine till O. To get logins to work by telling them to just use their email address I had to update the student logins with their respective domain. Otherwise Id have to tell them to log in with ltusernamegtltmaindomaingt.org which would just be confusing...So for us other then making it so they can use their email to login to O.. thats about it.If you dont have a need to split the domains I wouldnt myself.
