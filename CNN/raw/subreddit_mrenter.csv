3475180,0,t1_cnj886k,After doing some digging I found a few thingsTLDR Emily Partridge identifies the artist of Clarence Skyler Page as having sexually assaulted her. He is swiftly fired by Cartoon Network. As you would expect lots of discussion and arguments happen on social media platforms like Twitter and Tumblr. Later Skyler Pages friend Jeff Rowe posts on the mental condition of Skyler. Skyler is currently in the hospital receiving treatment for mental illness. Specifically a form of Bipolar  that results in prolonged psychotic episodes not sleeping for days and erratic sometimes frightening behavior that mimics schizophrenia. On the same day the assault happened Skyler also walked through the streets shirtless screaming at cops.So yeah. The show is wracked in controversy because its creator most likely suffers from a mental disorder and he has done some pretty shitty things to people. ,mrenter,cpoe9qo,2,t5_33zb1
