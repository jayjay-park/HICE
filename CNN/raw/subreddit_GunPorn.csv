2185760,0,t1_clhggau,There are others out there but the nature of the piston cartridge system means that The ammo is stupidly expensive which would prohibit largescale usage. The muzzle velocity suffers greatly because you are preventing a good portion of the energy from being imparted to the projectile.  The trapped gases are under great pressure and the energy from the pressurized gas was not allowed to act on the bullet unlike a traditional cartridge. Because you have garbage muzzle velocity your range and accuracy are going to be equally crappy.One example that I can think of off the top of my head is the Soviet SM which used a fairly similar piston system to propel a .x mm slug.  It was a  shot derringer pistol that was basically only used for assassination at point blank range.,GunPorn,clhnvv4,1,t5_2sey3

Equal and opposite reactions refers to momentum and a small object going quickly will have the same momentum as a very large one moving slowly.Essentially any effect on the accuracy from the barrel moving is going to be very small since the barrel simply weighs to much to accelerate quickly enough and interfere with the accuracy of the round before it exits the barrel.Any blowback action from antimateriel rifles to pistols work on the same principle the bullet being much lighter than the action and leaving the gun before the action can interfere with the accuracy to any great extent.,GunPorn,cmqa125,1,t5_2sey3

Drilling that pin hole in the atfs eyes would be a new machine gun. Looks like an SOTs post sample gun that they converted as if it was a factory noveske Im guessing the third position would have been engraved. Most SOTs use the cheapest lowers they can find to post sample as they have to machine out the inside and drill the sear hole. Once that is done the lower is worthless. You cant sell it unless you are giving up your sot or the dealer buying has a demo letter. Most of them would just make their own. ,GunPorn,d8y3ety,3,t5_2sey3

So far its working!Lower Receiver   I went with this lower because I saw this at my LGS for MSRP but  it was a deal to me since the cheapest FFL transfer fee in my area is !!. Factoring in that and shipping this was the cheapest one Id likely be able to get. I didnt like the straight Colt magazine look at first but it grew on me.Finding mags for this was a bitch since Ive got magazine limits in my state so I had to drive  hours to buy a  dollar magazine in order to test fire this PCC  was it worth it? Considering the magazine I bought that day is the worst one out of all of my mm colt mags in hindsight no. But the rifle sang as I fed it  rounds of cheap steelcased ammo that day so I was happy. Now I use Metalforms magazine made for Palmetto State Armory since they are literally Metalform magazines generally the best mags for Coltmag lowers which often go for a nice  with a PSA baseplate for  the price or less. They consistently feed well and lock open on the last round. Theyre just such a bitch to load.I did end up buying a  round ASC mag for bench rest shooting  more on that later.Upper Receiver  Ive always considered sidecharging rifles as the most ergonomic rifles to charge clear malfunctions etc. So I bought this with the intention of possibly building something stupid like . Beowulf build. I went with a nonreciprocating sidecharger from Gibbz since this was the one with the best reviews and most spaceagey aesthetic. I had this upper built by a gunsmith into a standard . chambering at first but after a couple months decided that it was time for a pistolcaliber carbine.The machining on the receiver was immaculate when I received it but I scratched it up pretty bad in the vice since this billet upper didnt fit inside a milspec sized vice block.I also ran into some additional problems with this upper firstly the screw that holds the detent that keeps the charging handle in place when not in operation came loose and flew off into the abyss. Secondly that gunsmith I mentioned earlier somehow managed to severely mar the threads for where the barrel nut screws into. How this happened I dont know  its too late by now since he up and disappeared into the ether.Another problem is that its fucking fat. Many handguards nowadays have antirotation tabs that fit well on a milspec forged upper but may have trouble fitting on some billet uppers. Well this billet upper is on of those uppers. I had to return my ALG handguard and ended up with the one Im currently usingOther than that this upper looks great and functions beautifully. People are always complimenting my rifle at the range  well other than the carry handle...Rear Sight  I went with a carry handle because I simply love how great the rear sight is. Now many have asked Why not just go with a LMT LA or something? Well simply put the LA is just too expensive for my tastes when I could just get a used USGI carry handle off of eBay for  the price. Ive always liked the carry handle look too so I ended up on the Carry Handle is Love Carry Handle is Life train.It also gets people to look at it with disgust something that never fails to crack me up.Front Sight  Unsatisfied with the halfhooded sorta HK style front sight from Troy and other companies the search was on for a fullyhooded truly HK style front sight. Not knowing much about the many different AR variants used by the US Armed Forces imagine the joy of finally finding the front sight youve wished for in the form of the Mk Mod  SPR.Now the front sight used on the Mk Mod  is actually a gasblock mounted flipup sight something I couldnt use with my nogasblock mm build. I was sure that the manufacturer HAD to have had a regular fixed sight... And I was right.  cheap  purchase later and I had my relatively unique sight picture.Handguard  Call me cheap but an American made handguard for  bucks was waaaaay too cheap to pass up. This probably wont be on the finished build but right now it serves its purpose wonderfully. It protects my hands and mounts my front sight! And it doesnt suck! Good enough for me.Bolt  I bought this bolt sheerly due to cost. This was  less than the cheapest bolt I could find with decent reviews for the manufacturer and  less than the average. When this baby arrived I set out on looking for the blemish and lo and behold! Nothing. I dont know where the blemish is but its not noticeable at all. It functions perfectly with no complaints from me at all whatsoever. The bolt was also cut for Glock mags too that was a nice plus.The only downside to this bolt was not being able to use ASC mm mags without modification. The feed lips were too narrow and were stopping the bolt from fully going into battery. This required opening up the one of the feed lips with a file. After performing the deed they function just as well as my Metalform magazines.Barrel  I did my research on which barrel had the least trouble with feeding and my research concluded that I should get a barrel from Faxon. The feed ramps on many barrels such as some barrels from QC are too steep enough and can cause FTFs while Faxon cuts more gradual feed ramps to ensure proper feeding. I ended up getting a barrel from Kaw Valley Precision since their barrels are actually made by Faxon. I bought the barrel off of Joe Bob Outfitters for  less than the manufacturers website.The barrel came in a standard barrel packaging plastic netting bubble wrap nothing too fancy. The barrel it self looked amazing  it seemed almost a shame to cover this beauty up with a handguard. Installation was standard and I took this out to the range. Dead on at  yards with standard mm performance past that aka its alright... Not a single failure of any kind. I say KVPFaxon barrels are an absolute goButtstockPistol grip  When I first saw this on thefirearms blog I knew what I as going to use on my rifle. I threw on a standard A pistol grip and Magpul MOE stock as placeholders until I got this stock. It arrived the day I made this post so as you can tell Im a happy camper.The build quality is very nice the pistol grip is angled according to how I like it and the cheekweld is reminiscent of an A buttstock but shorter. The length of pull is  around a standard carbine stock extended to its  position which is very nice for some but too short for me. There are  QD holes on the stock  one on each side both emblazoned with HERA GMBH Germany. The black panel in the on the inferiorposterior portion of the stock comes off to reveal a picatinny rail apparently meant for a monopod.Its not all good though. It was a bit of a pain to screw in the pistol grip portion of the rifle  theres a black grip panel on the grip that detaches to allow you to screw it in. The only problem is that the angle in which you can screw it in really sucks  I had to really really slowly turn only millimeters at a time. It took me at least  minutes of slowly turning to fully screw it in.This thing is also heavy   I could easily shoot this rifle one handed before but now I can hardly hold it out long enough to even take aim. Its also much shorter than Id thought itd be  it definitely lives its name of Close Quarters Rifle Stock. In the future I plan on getting the mm spacer right now theres a mm spacer on it to increase the length of pull to around what I had before.Muzzle device  I got this thing for free so I figured Id use it. I had a generic thread protector before but this serves the same purpose. Ill keep it on till I get a tax stamp on this baby but I dont really see myself replacing it before then. I dont need a flash hider and a muzzle brake on a  mm PCC? HA!,GunPorn,dd6hgy1,9,t5_2sey3
