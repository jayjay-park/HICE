5408086,0,t1_cvzp7yc,My suggestion would be to talk to her about maybe mounting loved but rarely used items such as a rare keyboard to the wall where it can be seen and enjoyed.It sounds like her heartache in tidying is she worries no one will love these things as she does. So maybe the first thing for her is connection to a community she can seed by tidying.  For example the museum of the living computer has a mailing list that includes the people who keep these things going and other people who love classic computing machines.  Between it and the resurgence in pin ball created in part by competitive leagues there is probably a place to share a lot of the stuff she keeps on hand just in case and a place where she might be able to get things she needs later even if she doesnt have a home wearhouse.With electronic components she could potentially build kits out of some of her overage for things like a girl scout troop.The worry of not having enough in the case of rare items is sensible so it might just mean that you have a collection of things that cannot be gotten rid of but that do not spark joy and will only be needed on a rare occasion.This might seem contrary to all principals but in that case I suggest setting up Offsite storage ... But you should do it in a deliberate way as a true storehouse with organization and labeling and clear display on shelves so when you do need something you dont have a huge horrible task instead you can go get what you need and nothing more and enjoy feeling prepared.It also makes it clear that keeping this stuff isnt free you do pay rent for it which can help make the calculation of what is actually hard enough to find to be worth paying to store.,konmari,cw2xz2e,1,t5_36kvo

6769459,0,t3_48hmg0,I would bring it with you when you do a specific category or bring your stuff from your apartment over to your parents if theres more room there. The biggest thing for me was to actually see it all together at once. I bet if you put all your loungewear together and then handle each piece individually you will have more success than if you tackle each place individually. If you need to break it apart break apart the categories instead of the locations. So maybe do sweatshirts separately or something like that.,konmari,d0jlkmg,9,t5_36kvo
6870746,0,t1_d0qsx5c,I think I get it now thank you so much!  This is what I call the coat rack theory.  Many like  years ago I read Organizing From The Inside Out and it helped me quite a bit at the time I have ADHD. In that book she talks about how someone would throw her coat on the arm of the couch as she came in because it was right next to the front door and the coat closet was across the room. The authors point was that sure you should put it in the coat closet but rather than beating yourself up for not doing so or being able to do so for a couple weeks before falling back in to bad habits... just put up a freaking coat rack next to the door.  I always remember this... and have done decently at incorporating it into my life already.  Sounds like thats what Kondo is getting at too! ,konmari,d0v3zmk,2,t5_36kvo

8511093,0,t1_d62p8me,I have noticed a common trend. Male college students in their late teensearly twenties tend to not have any decorations or even furniture. Its very basic living even though theyre not in the dorms anymore. Late sEarly s males without roommates have apartments with nice matching furniture and decorations that bring the room together. Females in their ss tend to be very neat and organized. A lot of decorations and pictures. Most have whiteboards in the common space where they write notes to each other about bills and cleaning tasks. Families tend to be the messiest of all. If they have small kids you can usually tell as your walking to their door because theres toys outside. Many people do a pretty good job at maintaining order but they fall into the storage trap. Theres usually storage everywhere. It doesnt look bad but now that Ive read this book Im like  positive they hardly look in there. ,konmari,d65fyrh,5,t5_36kvo
8554679,0,t3_4wv7hp,Ive been where you are! It took me a long time to unravel that keeping stuff for them said as much about me not wanting to rock the boat pleasing them as it said about them scarcity issues not wanting to throw things away. It also made me think. Im a grown up now and I deserve to have the space I want to live in. If someone gives me something they dont control what I do with it after I receive it. Nor do I control what people do with what I give. That goes for a lot of things beyond possessions but thats another conversation. tldr If you think the basement storage is a good idea even temporary go for it. Do what you feel is right for you. You live in your space not them!,konmari,d6awqw2,5,t5_36kvo

8879587,0,t3_51uodv,Most clothing items can be replaced. If you toss something now and then in the future decide you miss it you could try writing it on a list of clothing wants then waiting a month or two and see if it still appeals to you? If not yay! If you still wish you had it seek out a replacement.

9905295,0,t1_daymqw6,Its not about numbers  thats more minimalism than KonMari. If you love each one or they serve a functional purpose then keep them provided you have the space and storage of course. Some people might have a large number of something that brings them joy but thats their choice. Others might think its ridiculous or unnecessary but just ignore other peoples opinion this is about your happiness.Just out of curiosity though do you wear each and every dress? I mean could you pick a dress and easily put an outfit together  shoes jacket accessories and itll spark joy as you head out the door? Im asking because I had items in my wardrobe that I like to call orphans  an item that never really went with anything else so it was just never worn or very rarely worn. I got rid of these items and some of these items still had their price tag on!I know someone suggested the clothes hanger trick but maybe you should try putting things in a box instead. Just put some dresses or whatever that youre not sure about into a box and store away out of sight. If you havent look in  months you know the items dont spark joy. Donate the box without opening.,konmari,dayoluy,2,t5_36kvo

10322479,0,t1_dcdgb13,Youre allowed to keep everything that sparked joy the book was not about throwing everything away. For most people though it also meant that a lot of things did not spark joy which was why they should get rid of it. You should gather each item of its category and follow her instruction in the book. Doing Kon Mari does not mean you have to have bare walls  no furniture and wear white all the time. ,konmari,dce3ypc,8,t5_36kvo

I kept my favourites that I absolutely love in a small ziplock bag just in case. They fit in a larger cosmetic bag that holds all my travel toiletries so they arent cluttering up my shelf.

10988910,0,t3_5wx2xo,Honeymoon registry! We used Wanderable but there are a bunch of sites out there now. We used this to go to Disney World and it was the best idea. Plane tickets hotel room meal plan souvenirs MrMrs Mickey ears etc. You can break each expense down into smaller quantities e.g.  gifts of  for a single  item. Then they send you a single check when you request it and you spend the money as you need especially useful if youre ballparking something like plane tickets and then find a good deal.We specified no gifts but someone always wants to give something. We also gave options of giving us something homemade got a couple quilts we love something off an Amazon registry for the traditionalists or donate to the SPCA where wed adopted our cats.But seriously that honeymoon registry was the best. You can also do them for other things like a down payment on a house! And if you really want to have a traditional registry you could set it up through this kind of site and allow multiple people to contribute small sums of money towards more expensive items like a Kitchaid mixer.   ,konmari,dedk3pv,57,t5_36kvo

11638565,0,t3_662gpw,I wanted to feel less anxiety about the way my house looked.  My close friends didnt care about the clutter but when acquaintances called and were  minutes up the street and wanted to stop by I was frantically running around throwing shit in closets and drawers that were already stuffed to the gills and just creating enormous anxiety for myself because the house was never really ready for impromptu guests.  Even if my contractor came over to look at something I felt embarrassed about the way the house looked.  I also could never find anything I needed which is why when I decluttered I found duplicates of tons of items I was always buying something I owned already but couldnt find.  I guess those are emotional reasons to declutter getting rid of the anxiety.  Its not exactly calming to be tearing your house apart looking for a little USB plugin memory stick thing when youve already purchased half a dozen of them and cant find any of them.  And then running down to Walgreens to get another one. I didnt do konmari the book wasnt published yet when I decluttered but my reasons for decluttering were to decrease my anxiety about how my house looked and increase my ability to find stuff.  Both of which I accomplished.   I didnt write anything down or do story boards or whatever I just knew what my vision was  to own a fraction of the shit that was stuffing up my house. Last  Friday I discovered the  deadbolt lock on my back door was broken and I had to call a locksmith. The woman at the locksmith said they had a guy available to come within the hour ! which was surprising and I said sure send him over Ill be here.  Before I decluttered the house I wouldnt have agreed to that because I wouldnt have had time to throw shit in the closet before he came.  In order to get to the back door he had to come in the front door pass through the living room the parlor the dining room and then the kitchen all of which would have had to be decluttered.  Can you imagine living like that. It was hell. Last Friday I just picked up my book and read while I was waiting for the guy to show up. ,konmari,dgf8t8e,26,t5_36kvo
