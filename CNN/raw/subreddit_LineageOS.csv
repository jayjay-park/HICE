10687702,0,t1_ddiampd,gt For free!So you do this for the money that is yet to come? Thats the true open source spirit.gt Thats right because none of us actually use Lineage we just put bugs in so we can laugh at you the users. I mean thats the only explanation for a team of  developers not pressing the power button in Lineage right?You hit the nail thats exactly how it seems. Or are you saying the issue does not exist despite numerous people confirming it on a number of devices?gt Sure easy steps to reproduce makes life way easier. What doesnt make life easier is users demanding that we fix bugs.You are welcome  and for the record I never demanded anything. Your arguments come out of thin air.gt If youre so keen to fix this bug youre more than welcome to do it yourself. Otherwise youll need to wait until someone else finds a spare hour or two to fix your bug.Its not my bug thats still yours. And I wonder how that someone should find one hour for an issue if they  apparently  are not even aware of its presence.And please spare us the Torvaldsesque OS arrogance of fix it yourself. First I never demanded an immediate fix I havent even asked for a fix even though an eventual fix should be reasonable but enquired as to why such bugs cant be reported  reading my original post might help a lot here and second if I had the required expertise in the Android or rather LOS as it seems ecosystem I would have fixed it a long time ago. Obviously I dont. I discovered the issue two days ago and if I have had the chance to report it there might be some chance it would be fixed in the next weekly. Now that someone can report it the earliest this weekend and that policy is actually brandnew under CM issues couldnt be reported for weeksmonths that seems highly unlikely.

10787487,0,t3_5u7fvg,It actually depends on the device. Let me explain.For Android Pay to work multiple things need to happen. First of all SafetyNet and CTS need to pass. On most devices the only issue that comes from this is that it fails in the presence of an su binary. This can be solved by making a script to hide it using something like Magisk to hide it or not flashing the root addon. However on some devices the kernel sends out whether the bootloader is unlocked or not if SafetyNet detects that it is unlocked then it will fail. This can be solved by a custom kernel however this isnt officially supported so I wont go into detail. Once you get this done Android Pay should work. However on the OnePlus One there is an issue with an NFC driver that I dont really understand other than the fact it doesnt make Android Pay work. However there are ways to get this fixed that other people have linked.Also this is just my understanding of it. If I got something wrong please tell me.,LineageOS,ddsngux,9,t5_3htpk

Unfortunately you may be unsuccessful because of a small userbase and as yureka note has a MediaTek processor which can be harder for opensource development.

11527184,0,t1_dg2evmy,E You are correct for FF. No Crashlytics in Brave cannot be turned off and it is nonfree software and  shouldnt be included in a free software project  you cannot verify that it is ever inactive  I think there are complications with building the app without it.In contrast Firefox has telemetry which tells you exactly what it takes data on and because it is free software you have the freedom to audit the code and view the data it receives how it depersonalizes it and how it is transmitted proper SSL implementation I believe. I believe you can also preview the data it sends inside the browser without the programming knowhow.I dont think the implementation and exact nature of the data obtained via crashlytics is even documented by Brave.Edit I reread our comments and realised I wasnt clear and you thought I was calling Firefox nonfree.
