464247,0,t3_1zeblg,Any teeth coming in that you can see? Or feel? Its a good idea to get your kid used to poking around in their mouth since youll have to brush his teeth  some point or put some numbing gel on an erupting molar. If hes drooling a lot thats usually a sign but   mos they usually drool a lot anyway.  Primary teeth tend not to come in until  months but  months isnt out of the ordinary at all. Orajel and topical numbing agents arent recommended for little guys like yours since they can occasionally cause some breathing problems if their throats get too numbgo by your pediatricians recommendations for ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain control of course. But by the time that theyre toddlers and their bicuspids first molars are coming in its usually fine to numb them up wteething gelwhich is a total blessing because they cry really loud by then! ,FormulaFeeders,cft1bgu,3,t5_2u8ru

3238997,0,t3_2x44xy,Hi! Im a mother of a  year old girl who was both formula fed and breastfed and a  month old boy who is breastfed. Im a mod on rbreastfeeding and Im training to become a La Leche League leader. Im here because I want to keep formulabottle feeding methods and perspectives fresh in my memory as I train with LLL. Its amazing how much you forget as your kids get older. I already forget how I used to mix feed. I want to be able to support all motherbaby dyads. Hopefully Ill be able to contribute here sometimes too.I LOVE reatcheapandhealthy,FormulaFeeders,coxq8x5,3,t5_2u8ru
3959137,0,t1_cr750bq,You could keep adding it in with the formula until its gone I suppose. If it doesnt bother him you might as well use it up and save a bit of money.,FormulaFeeders,cr7kps4,2,t5_2u8ru

6320510,0,t1_cz81662,Not silly at all! It is a pain to make up formula at night lol. Im very thankful my daughter is down to  wakeup a night. The powder is definitely way cheaper  we buy the Sams Club generic of Similac and its seriously like  of the price of the readymade. We use little travel containers for the formula when we go out ... much nicer than hauling the  pound box of formula haha.,FormulaFeeders,cz82ma3,1,t5_2u8ru

7101186,0,t3_4ct86a,Its generally recommended to burp when a feed is done.  If Ive forgotten to burp George theres a good chance Ill find him cranky some point later maybe  minutes maybe an hour and as soon as I move him around a huge burp happens and he calms down.  I understand the whole not wanting to wake them up   I too have avoided burping thinking itd disturb the baby but if hes asleep it really doesnt stir him enough to fully wake him up.  Once he burps Im able to put him down and he continues to sleep.,FormulaFeeders,d1lai3x,0,t5_2u8ru
7204547,0,t3_4e43o4,I didnt restrict the amount he got so I increased whenever he finished a bottle frequently... so sorry cant help you here but I guess its trial and error. As long as you feel that he is satisfied with the  oz bottle its okay I guess.Re nipple size I used the smallest ones for a long time well beyond  months. I didnt see a reason to switch until I was tired of the long feeding times.,FormulaFeeders,d1x3l7z,1,t5_2u8ru
7405093,0,t1_d2jqy1b,Before the  month sleep regression I kind of just let K take naps whenever the hell she seemed tired we would have a cuddle and then we would sleep. She was perfectly happy with this set up. When shit started to get rough I started getting strict on her naps. Like even if she only slept for  minutes Id get her to take a nap three times a day every   . hours and a nap time routine. I think around  months they go from being cool with just kind of cuddling and falling asleep to needing their routine to help send their body a signal like hey brain were going to nap now. For a long time she still slept with me but we had to read a book first and then she would lay on our bed and id rub her back or whatever while she fell asleep. Every kid is different and whats going to work for my routine wont work for yours. Its really helped us! I dont know if you have a nap time routine yet but if not I totally suggest getting one going. ,FormulaFeeders,d2jwscj,2,t5_2u8ru
7795623,0,t3_4m1oqg,H is SO weird with her bottles lately. It literally takes  minutes to feed her sometimes. She plays around wiggles takes breaks etc. She still takes small amounts frequently so I feel like Im feeding her all day long.,FormulaFeeders,d3sac15,2,t5_2u8ru
7816947,0,t1_d3ukrob,My son was still having Oz until  months. Then once he got the hang of finger food he decreased and now at  months he has  Oz a day. ,FormulaFeeders,d3uotul,2,t5_2u8ru
8013528,0,t3_4oxsjc,How long has it been? I found time the best way to get over the guilt. I stopped because I had a ruptured abscess next to one nipple and the other boob couldnt keep up. It broke my heart to make the decision to stop and there were tons of tears and stress because of it. But I slowly stopped the good boob. I made the decision to quit when she was about  weeks old. I did my last good boob feed when she was  weeks old. I think I hung on that long mostly for my sake though I was down to only two feeds a day always topped up with formula by about  weeks. Anyway I felt way better about it at  weeks than I did at  weeks. It was all so raw and fresh then in the midst of all the craziness of should Ishouldnt I plus all the other stress going on. But after  weeks my baby started to become more of a baby smiling engaging playing doing things. And so feeding became less of the biggest thing in our lives and I think I started to rethink my role in her life  its not just food provider but also smileinducer playmate sleep maker singer dancer guide etc. And feeding was just a part of it. Also it depends on how you work your brain around things but I found understanding a bit of the facts around formula helped me a lot. It sounds like you know damn well that formula is a fine alternative to breastmilk and that your baby wont be any worse off because of it but reading up on that and doing the research really helped me come to terms with that. She really is fine. Also reading up on some of the sociological stuff around breastfeeding helped me too  like Amy Tuteurs Skeptical OB blog. She can be a bit sensational in some of her beliefs but she really gets at some of the reasons women feel so guilty about not breastfeeding or not achieving the natural birth they wanted etc. Its kind of fascinating and empowering too. Also seeing my baby be totally fine and then some with the formula helped too. The combo feeding took so much time when I was trying to breastfeed as much as possible. Life is easier when we just cut to the chase and get her fed.What got to me was more the emotional side. My baby came out ready to latch. She never had an issue. She did everything perfectly. And it was my stupid body that failed and robbed her of this thing that she was totally prepared to do. Its not the nutritional side of formula that bothered me but more that she did everything she was supposed to do and I couldnt meet her there. But those feelings have definitely faded and were only  weeks out now because while I wasnt able to give her the breastfeeding I wanted I give her tons more and seeing her big jumbo smiles when I talk to her is a nice little reminder that she doesnt hold the breastfeeding thing against me one bit. She never will. So give it time cut yourself some slack but if this is piggybacking on PPAPPD then talking to a therapist about it all will likely be a huge help too. Good luck!,FormulaFeeders,d4gsn1i,2,t5_2u8ru
8030553,0,t3_4p63pd,I feel you. Im due with  at the end of August. I had a traumatic experience in the hospital with  with BFing and ended up formula feeding and spiraling into awful PPD and feeling like an overall failure turned out to be an undiagnosed lip tie but whatever. He thrived and is now a smart and witty  year old. Cue getting pregnant with . I was determined to BF with this one. I have all the supplies got the Kiinde twist gift set my pump is on its way from the insurance etc etc etc. Ive switched from Prozac to Zoloft to breastfeed its apparently safer and Ive been struggling with that.  About a month ago I realized I am only doing this because I couldnt last time and not because I actually want to. I keep agonizing over it until I had a minibreakdown with my husband who said Try it in the hospital if you dont want to then formula feed. Dont feel guilty.  Nice to have him in my corner. Anyway tldr I feel you.,FormulaFeeders,d4ipk65,1,t5_2u8ru
8494020,0,t3_4w12fn,gtIn the  edition of The Baby Book attachment parenting guru Dr. Sears starts off by affirming that you can work and breastfeed at the same time but quickly adds that the ideal is to minimize time away from your baby while working. And all pretense gets dropped in the chapter titled Working and Parenting which declares To write that fulltime attachment mothering makes no difference would be dishonest ignoring what both research and experience have shown and trading truth for popularity. The rest of the chapter admonishes mothers that your presence is important to your babys development and while quality time is important so is the quantity of time. The chapter continues to argue that the effects of motherbaby separation are a lessening of the benefits of motherinfant attachment and baldly states If you are blessed with a highneed baby  fulltime mothering for a longer time may be your only real option.I checked that book out of the library and this was the part that made me return it. I wanted a book on how to take care of my baby not a fucking guilt trip.Its weird how all this pressure to breastfeed to take time off is so completely transferred to the mother. Not everyone is privileged in the US with maternity leave and not everyone can give up their salary for however long it takes.,FormulaFeeders,d63aw8p,3,t5_2u8ru
8758226,0,t1_d6saqwo,Yup same here. Due to my meds it was known via my midwife and I told every single midwifenurse who asked Id be exclusively formula feeding due to my medication  they were fine with it. They had to monitor him anyway due to gestational diabetes and to check he was doing ok with the med withdrawal. And it meant I got a little sleep and dad could feed him too. ,FormulaFeeders,d70frd1,2,t5_2u8ru

Were currently transitioning him from the Sams Club generic for Gentlease to the Costco generic for regular formula basically Similac but cheaper. They actually do put their formula on sale every so often which will be nice! My older son was on it the entire time and I never saw it go on sale! Im not really in need of any other deals since the store brands are more reasonable. I appreciate you asking though! ,FormulaFeeders,d72z2ss,1,t5_2u8ru
