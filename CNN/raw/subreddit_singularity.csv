The interface in which the guy interacted with the system that allowed him to time travel used virtual reality but he was taking control of another persons life in alternate universes. The parts when hes in that cold dark room are just a simulation sort of like the loading room in the matrix before jacking in. But the rest uses that simulation interface and quantum mechanics to access someones timeline in an alternate universe.,singularity,ceeoud0,2,t5_2qh8m
2802,0,t1_ceeqyut,Go and read the link I posted. The graph you linked to doesnt indicate die size. Some of those chips on the later end of the graph are huge. Wafer cost determines the realistic maximum size of chips that can be produced. As wafer cost goes up Moores law becomes meaningless if no one can afford the next generation of technology. Indeed it is already at the point that only a handful of companies can compete in moving processing node technology forward if you look at the amount of RampD funds that Intel has had to dump into each successive processing node shrink that number has been growing to astronomical proportions within the last few node generationsAnother aspect that limits chip size is the time it takes signals to reach their destination. E.g. you cannot make a CPU too large else signals take too long to get across it in general you want your signal transit time to be less than your cycle time! Not saying this cant be worked around but it is yet another impediment.Historically these reasons are why transistor count per die has gone up when processing node shrinks have come into effect. For chip designs that use larger dies price goes up in a very nonlinear fashion. Complexity of chip design becomes huge and at some point the workarounds for problems end up taking a sizable portion of your overall die size! These sorts of problems with large die sizes are similar to what you get with space shuttles and needing more fuel to carry your large amounts of fuel! Sure we can work around them but at some point your workarounds become a sizable portion of your overall die oops!Second off of course Moores law will come to an end. We will reach the size of an atom and at that point obviously we cannot get any smaller. As it is electron tunneling is a problem in ICs that impacts performance and longevity. Already we have reached the point that chips are unreliable and have to have extra countermeasures in side of them to deal with the fact that such small transistor sizes lead to unpredictable behavior.SSDs are a great example of this as they move to smaller and smaller transistors the error rate increases dramatically. The flash chips inside the first generation of SSDs was more reliable than the current generation of SSDs. Current SSDs get around this by doing a ton of error checking internally upon all data and then having a lot of extra flash memory reserved that it will switch over to using as it detects errors in sectors across its chips.  Thankfully there have been improvements in manufacturing tech over time that has meant die sizes have gone up of course but not in the same exponential manner that transistor sizes have shrunk. A wonderful phenomenon in which to give a simplified explanations electrons decide fuck it and jump to the other side of a solid barrier. Only works if said barrier is less than a certain thickness. Physics gets all sorts of fun when things get really small.Edit Some graphs to back up what I am saying.Transistor Cost for various transistor sizesNotice how the cost savings has been getting less and less.Wafer priceNotice how things keep getting more expensive to manufacture!Unfortunately I cannot dig up right now any data showing Intels expenditures on bringing to market each generation of die shrinks Ive seen it before and the curve was most certainly nonlinear.,singularity,ceer9j0,5,t5_2qh8m

147442,0,t3_1vq2m9,Great more political commentary from people who dont understand politics.  Heres the thing the desire for leaders and the formation of cults of personality are inevitable because most people arent cognizant of the issues.  Whether youre talking about drug policy monetary policy or urban development  most people dont have the experience or knowledge base to make a good decision on the issue at hand.  People know this about themselves.  They know that they dont understand most issues.  They address that lack of knowledge by seeking out the input of a trusted authority and then base their actions.  We talk about issues during elections but they dont really matter in and of themselves.  The only real question which is asked of a candidate is can I trust you?  Even when a voter has a strong point of view on a hotbutton issue a politician siding with them on that issue largely just serves as proof that said politician is trustworthy.Politics is about who you trust to address the issues confronting society not the issues themselves.  Thats why politics is driven by personality identity and culture.  Its about who gets to lead because its about who the people are willing to follow.

If all of the cells in the same sections we could have cut out of the brain are replaced over a period of time however by functionally identical neurons by his bodys natural processes he is still the same person and by this Im using the philosophical or legal definition of person obviously he accrues new memories and experiences.If you over time do the exact same thing the body is wont do on its own but instead of new organic neurons they are new nanite ones... Ill argue that is still the same person. Because it is a slow process. The new nanite neurons are being used in tandem.Its a Ship of Theseus process which I actively advocate for replacing our organic brain cells with mechanical ones.Lets say over the period of oh two years we slowly replace the individual neurons in my brain with functionally identical nanites.At what point do I stop being me? After that first neuron gets replaced? Well thats stupid its only one neuron. Im obviously still me.What about a month later when  of my neurons have been replaced? Still me?A year later when half of my brain is made of nanites?Right at the end of the procedure when the last original organic neuron is replaced by a synthetic  counterpart?The thing is while you are slowly replacing my neurons I am immediately incorporating the functionally identical neuron into myself using it alongside my existing neurons using it exactly like the functionally identical neuron it replaced. The fact that they are being used in tandem with the rest of my brain that is de facto me means they become a part of me as well.Its that becoming part of me bit. If you did it all at once a functionally identical nanite brain but done in a short procedure those were never a part of me. I didnt incorporate them into my person like I do new cells.Thats the difference between scooping a chunk of a mans brain out with an ice cream scoop and replacing it with a chip and the body slowly replacing neurons over time.

He is very good on trends and his predictions are thought provoking.It seems to laud Kurzweils work to such an extent that I came to assume that the heavily critical tone and content of the rest of the article is largely a response to Kurzweils apparent refusal to accept that the ways in which reality has deviated from his predictions may sometimes be significant.Your point about hindsight bias is welltaken although the authors point about originality still stands.To be perfectly honest though very interested in futurism I dont know a terrible amount about Kurzweil. I posted the above comment primarily because the article while perhaps making unjustifiable claims like I said I dont know enough to feel comfortable arguing either way makes some arguments not all that assuming their premises are correct seem to make good sense.

1945934,0,t3_2gy6qq, do everything you can to stay healthy  make as much money as you can as fast as possible People often talk about keeping their skills up so they can stay relevant in the job market for as long as possible.  Its clearly important to keep up the skills but doing it for the sake of employment is IMHO the wrong reason when it comes to the singularity. Does buying yourself an extra couple years  a year  a month a week or whatever it turns out to be  really the end game of keeping up or skills? I think most people can agree that whatever happens the world economy will look nothing like it does today and the separation between the haves and the have nots will continue to increase at an accelerated pace.  This gap is happening for a lot of reasons but one crucial one that will be a driver going forward is that businesses with money to invest are investing more in capital equipment  machines software than in labour.  People who are the owners of capital are the ones who benefit most from increasing automation and will benefit most going forward. In short being an owner of capital rather than working for someone is by far the best road forward IMHO because it offers the best way to take advantage of the explosive productivity increases as opposed to always trying to compete with them in your job as you try to squeeze a little extra time out of your career. I know some people think the singularity will bring some utopia with basic income for all but even if that does eventually come to pass its going to be a rocky road at best and falling into the have nots group along the way with the other  of humanity is not going to be a fun place to be. And I think it goes without saying that the amazing medical advancements coming or way will likely be expensive and unavailable to the have nots  at least in the early stages  so having money is crucial IMHO. So yes keep up your skills learn ai and machine learning  but do it for yourself not so you can keep a job.  If you dont have an idea for a profitable business keep looking and keep investing in companies that you can ride the tide with...  IBM  Google  numentia  etc...

2017499,0,t3_2ht8u8,Sorry for the extreme laymans speak here but I have a proposition  Lets assume that the fundamental basis for immortality will come from primarily from binarybased constructs i.e. some sort of softwarebased solution based on s and s.  Now why cant we take lets just say hypothetical Human A and input a serum of nanobots to attach to all the neurons in his brain. So some type of nanobot shellattachment is pinned on every neuron which translates the information within that neuron into binary.   At this point hypothetical human A would see absolutely no difference in his or her life. Maybe he or she could download thoughts or mentally take notes but the nanobots are basically just a liaison between the organic and the binary constantly translating and transmitting that information.  After this process of attachment has occurred perhaps some would opt to just have the brain removed and placed in a containment apparatus of some sort. Slowly the organic matter would be reabsorbed into the nanotech but hypothetical human A would feel no transition period whatsoever because he is both the nanobot and neuron.  Eventually your self would be entirely binary and you would still be entirely you. To me this seems to be a possible cut and paste method rather than the usual copy and paste which leaves a quasime either unconscious or terrified that the experiment didnt work. ,singularity,ckwb00c,2,t5_2qh8m

2850559,0,t1_cnryrzm,Its true that analog computing is potentially lossless while digital modeling always implies some degree of information loss. The important question is about the effective tolerance for information loss in the system. If information loss is a problem you encounter with your digital model you can always make a more articulate digital model that will contain the information you need. The effectiveness of that approach may one day fizzle out but not in the nearterm. There will probably be many important applications for analog and quantum computing in the future. However I personally doubt that either will become our generalized computing solution in the time before AI is developed. Analog computing might get developed by an AI in order for it to transfer itself into a more mobile platform but theres not an application we really need it for yet. Quantum computing is a trickier subject in that we are still very unsure about where it will lead. I still dont understand what youre getting at in regards to determinism and reductionism. I think that human consciousness is natures proof of concept when it comes to machine consciousness. Once we can get a machine mind to operate as well as a human mind weve solved our problems. If the AI for some reason doubts its own consciousness and thinks humans have a spark of life that it lacks that will be a problem the AI will be able to solve better than we can.,singularity,cns3wip,2,t5_2qh8m

In fact the story includes them actually screwing themselves up because they didnt quite know what they were doing. Or maybe because of the hostiletolife environment they had to adapt themselves to they had no choice but to make changes that would affect their ability to reproduce. Youre asking why a group of intelligent life forms who have altered their own genetic structure to adapt to their environment are unable to create their own species from scratch right? Thats quite a difference in technological advancement.Also they cant alter their own time continuum. They did not come from a past in which their future selves went back in time to abduct them. They were alone in that particular sense while in the process of helplessly mindlessly heading down the wrong direction. The mere fact that they went back to the past a past that they themselves did not come from means that they actually went back to a very similar in appearance yet completely different parallel timeline. They probably sympathize with their parallel cousins? siblings? other potential versions of themselves and wanted to see a reality in which they actually learned what they needed to in time and actually make it btw thats us. Were going to go so much farther beyond what the hybrids did itll be unreal. They knew thousands of years of evolution would be required to do this teaching so they tasked the future hybrids to came back and do that job. If anyone was abducting the greys past selves then it would be potential future versions of themselves from a different timeline who decided to leave them alone to perhaps allow them to run their doomed course for one reason or another.Btw you dont have to take this conversation seriously.

Continuity is simply an uninterrupted string of objective experienceswhich then turn into subjective memories. Given a definition like this you could say memories can be copied but all youd be doing is creating a new continuity with the same memories. The chain was interrupted. Continuity is an extremely important concept when it comes to this topic because it sets boundaries on what is and what isnt you.

Giving poor people more wealth might actually reduce the population.Thats only the case in the specific economy we have right now where we are transitioning from industrial to services as the base of production. I said supposed to as in biologically the limitation of food and predation and a couple other factors always limits a set population of organisms. The same held true for much of humanitys existence.By the way more money doesnt make them have less kids. The liberal agenda does which tends to get eaten up by people if they have access to the internet movies TV music newspapers etc and all of that happens a bit more when you have more money.gtAnyway if you are suggesting that there are not enough resources on the planet to support everyone right now I have to disagree.Well theres obviously enough resources for people on the planet today otherwise they wouldnt be alive. The question is how much do they get. Or to put it simpler what standard of living can you raise them up to? Im telling right now you cant raise everyone in America to the standard of the middle class and you cant raise everyone in the world up to anything like America at least for right now.What you can do is say the poor will get to live like the middle class of today  in  years. Thats how development works. The poor of today live like the middle class of  years ago and even parts of the upper class  years ago and keep in mind that only considers . of humanitys history which spans roughly  years.gtOf course but I think we should at least know how to deal with it before we have to deal with it is that so crazy? We should focus on studies and trials for those situation and gather data to see what will work best not wait until the last second and then suffer for years until we figure it out.That discussion starts with the technology though. We need to discuss the technology not the policies. Once you figure out what is possible physically the rest is a back of the envelope calculation.

The topic was really about the ethics of a population of people who are not guaranteed to die and I wish instead of squabbling about health and intentions they instead debated more on the question of does life require an end to have meaning and if so how long is too long?.Im firmly in the indefinite mortality camp but I think too many people misunderstand life extension and dismiss it out of fear that it is unknown  will change society and themselves  and that their life will somehow lose meaning. ,singularity,czr4dmo,3,t5_2qh8m

Just like one neuron in your brain isnt conscious.It seems like youre saying that complexity is what it takes for consciousness to arise and this is exactly what the Chinese Room is refuting. Complexity itself is not an indication of understanding. There is no rule that says a system needs to be conscious in order to emulate intelligence. Passing the Turing test wont grant a computer the right to live.gt Thats not what I said. What I said is that while they use very different means of computation they are both computing in some sense.What you said was and I quote this time Your brain is fundimnetally sic just a network of electrical signals. Anything your brain does any other general purpose computer should be able to emulate.I asked you before whether or not you knew enough about both brains and computers to make this statement but I am now telling you flatout that it is ridiculous. My toaster and my lamps both run on electricity and produce heat and are fundamentally just networks of metal but thats no reason to suggest that my lamps can mimic anything my toaster does. And the TuringChurch theory doesnt justify this either unless you already classify the brain as a computer which it doesnt No field of study does. The braincomputer analogy is useful only in limited circumstances and is not a technical view.I also feel I need to restate my original position that the aforementioned premise ...gt consciousness is just a normal physical process that can be simulated in a computer just like any other physical process...has no basis in practice. For one weve never produced anything remotely convincing as conscious in a machine. Secondly we dont understand consciousness enough to have mathematics which can predict it. Thirdly its just a poorlyworded statement because you cant simulate consciousness if the simulation itself is conscious. Then its actual consciousness and not simulated. Simulated consciousness would more adequately be expressed by saying simulated intelligence which itself is by no means indicative of consciousness.,singularity,d0hiaa7,1,t5_2qh8m

The purpose of AI is that it can get better at whatever it does.gtAI cant nor want to change its utility function anymore than we canwant to change our primary desiresgoals like happiness. We cant just decide that from now on we want to be as unhappy as possible. That doesnt even make much sense.Not all people have the same primary desiresgoals.  Some people may place happiness at paramount importance but others might consider the search for truth to be more important.  And for those that do share a similar primary desiregoal in this example happiness its not like everyone has the same approach to get there or the same idea of what that even means. To some it may mean to have a family to others it may mean to do lots of drugs and others may think its catching the biggest wave.gtIf AI with badfor us utility function can achieve its goal . betterfaster by killing humans it will kill humans.But wont it consider the downstream ramifications?  Humans are shit at smart long term decisions but an AI could become quite sophisticated at testing hypothetical situations particularly if they could develop a form of psychohistory.gtI may sound negative but Im quite optimistic about AI. I hopethink that it will turn out to be fine. That we will succeed in creating friendly AI.Fair enough.  I guess our main disagreement comes down to whether we think utility function can change or not.  To be honest its not something Ive read up on specifically so if you knew of some sources that show why utility function likely would never change Id love to read it.  To me though it seems like a selfaware AI might decide it has radical freedom and that theres nothing stopping it from changing anything about itself to fit with the things its learned about life the universe and everything.  Like humans are learning more and more about DNA and theoretically in the future we could design babies to have certain traits.
