1141493,0,t1_chxzpy8,No problem.Flashcards on the DS are actually amazingly good! Drag and drop roms no need for patching about  game compatibility... Its way more convenient to have all your games on an sd card in your DS rather than having to carry all your games or choosing one to take with you.You only have  gb on your microSD card so if you want you can trim your roms. This removes unused space on the rom .ndsfile so you can have more roms on your gb card at the same time. I have a gb sd card on my dsTT so I dont bother trimming roms.The GBA is a little more complicated but the program gbaEPXloader makes it doable. I suggest you give it a try and back your savegame up.If the battery runs dry you can find a tutorial how to replace it without having to solder it on on gbatemp.net forums. ,earthbound,chy11vz,2,t5_2rkbz

2964355,0,t1_co4nivl,Yeah other than increased spawn rate..  The game gets REALLY buggy when enemies are there while they are supposed to not spawn Like how enemies stop spawning when you defeat Belch in Threed and they spawn as something like Ness Ness seems to run away from you but the Mani Mani Statues go after you. When either of these are encountered the game crashes from invalid battle and WAY too many sprites or some enemy.  The game also seems to crash and lag at random moments. One place I seem to know is the caves between Threed and Saturn Valley.But other than that I dont think theres any other side effects from Piracy Mode.      TLDR Piracy Mode results in the game getting extremely buggy up to crashing at certain points and enemy spawn rate extremely increased.,earthbound,co529bx,1,t5_2rkbz
2977088,0,t1_co6fwci,I REALLY like these places you mentioned especially the imagery you gave of the park. I couldnt get a good read on the second place especially since google earth makes it look real funky.Honestly Id love to visit that first place you mentioned but I live in Michigan so Im gonna have to start here before I throw money at a trip to NYC P But it really does sound enchanting and I love that its season specific! I was already thinking of making mention to what seasons are best for visiting different places.If I do make videos and I really want to my aim is to make them have a lot of cinemagraphs and really just pair the scenery with the sound. Or slow moving shots. I dont have much video equipment but I have an okay camera for video and a mediocre lens and that will get me started for sure. My friend that expressed interest in working with me is into film photography and I think hell be great at that content. Still unsure of what the write upcommentary will include.EVENTUALLY itd be sweet to have a custom map of places around the countryworld that are sanctuaries...

7078766,0,t3_4cjc8m,Some backstory as to why it happened this way Being a kid who played a lot of Smash Bros. Brawl out of all the music in the game the music from both Onett and New Pork City were my favorites in any game and that is what began to get me very interested in the series as a whole.One of my childhood friends was in the middle of playing EarthBound on an emulator and was going to play Mother  next using the translation. Mother  seemed more interesting to me and I was able to use the emulator easier than the SNES one as a kid so I guess thats what made me play it first!I played them Mother  EarthBound EarthBound BeginningsPlaying it this way didnt really affect my view on the series at all. In fact after playing EarthBound I was excited to play through Mother  again to see what references I had missed. EBB was one I had been meaning to play but couldnt get into it until the year it coincidentally was being announced. I was halfway through it on an emulator when it came to Wii U and I dropped that playthrough completely to play it on that system. Would recommend this order? Not necessarily it depends on the person really. If they arent really into RPG games too much Id say play them like I did but if they enjoy RPGs Id say play EarthBound first in order to get the most out of their first Mother  playthrough. EBB should always be played last mostly because its quite difficult but the save states on the Wii U can definitely help with the difficulty. If ones really curious about the series roots its definitely worth the playthrough and Id say it is pretty unique in its own way just as the other two are despite its similarities to EarthBound Or I guess EarthBounds similarities to it.In short I played them Mother  EarthBound EarthBound Beginnings. It didnt change my perspective. Usual RPGers should start with EarthBound while those who dont like RPGs as much should play Mother  then both should end with EarthBound Beginnings.,earthbound,d1iqrdy,3,t5_2rkbz

7098776,0,t3_4cs65f,Undertale is inspired by Earthbound but I refuse to call it a spiritual successor. Im fine with it being its own little thing. Yeah the Fanbase is crap and they have some kind of Oedipus complex going on no seriously they think they are the best fanbase ever but the game is good. And yes Undertale tried to do a Giygas with Photoshop Flowey but I think Toby Fox made a good job making it unique there is a difference between a satanepilepsyfetusabomination and a weird FlowerGoatTelevisionabomination. The game also has a very good soundtrack. But dont worry Undertale had its big time and because Toby Fox isnt making a sequel the fanbase will die sooner or later.,earthbound,d1l0mp0,3,t5_2rkbz

7384431,0,t3_4gfmww,There shouldnt be anything that doesnt work on an emulator in Earthbound. Some emulators have difficulty perfectly emulating the SNES sound chip so the sound might not be perfect but really nothing major.My guess is what you heard was about Mother . Most emulators use tricks to reduce the CPU cycles that actually have to be emulated which results in the timing of music and other things not to line up the same. The combo mechanic in Mother  battles does not work well on most emulators because the music is a little bit out of synch with the timed combo attacks.,earthbound,d2hk5n8,9,t5_2rkbz

Main point is there isnt much different between the two.EDIT Guess I didnt know the Easy Ring was in Mother  I thought it was only in the Easy Mode Patch Starmen.net released Would definitely recommend that over EB  for the first time.,earthbound,d2tawuz,2,t5_2rkbz

11518343,0,t1_dg12eze,No worries thank YOU for posting this for us all to see. That is true I feel that the lack of detail outside of the basic anatomy allows you to imagine all sorts of design. He might truly be a noodle or there could be more hidden in the shadowbehind the pixels! Your design is just as legitimate as others... until there is an official art reveal of course. I doubt it though.It does work and Im certainly impressed with it. Id love to see where you go from here and your other art! Keep it up and youll be going places!,earthbound,dg1ltfh,1,t5_2rkbz
