10172945,0,t3_5kjqz6,Great advice. Thanks  Do you put your arty into limber or do you just move them as they are? Also do forest affect their LOS? Sometimes I move them into position and they just sit there doing nothing ,ultimategeneral,dbx5qys,1,t5_2zg5v
10279310,0,t1_dc97kys,gt One thing that isnt terribly intuitive is that the effectiveness of mele cavalry is tied more significantly to unit size than any other unit. A successful charge of  cavalry into the side of any unit is devastating. But a charge of  is likely to just be routed by larger units .Wow thats really not intuitive. So its better to have fewer but larger units then. gtA trick is to micro your cavalry a little out of range and then as soon as the brigade you are going to charge prepares to fire begin your charge. That way while your cavalry is charging across the field exposed the enemy are reloading. If you play it right you can even frontal charge an enemy through your own lines and get into mele before they reload.Good advice thanks. gtranged Cavalry The AI for ranged cavalry is annoying.Im starting to come to this conclusion after some testing ... really too bad considering they were really important in ACW Bufords unit for example. ,ultimategeneral,dc97sep,1,t5_2zg5v
