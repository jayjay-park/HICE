870971,0,t3_2434xn,For the dice I saw someone posting this box on BGG and figured its cheaper than and looks more suitable than most planos.For the cards using this sleeved binder from ultra pro can hold one of every card in the game and holds them sleeved which is something I like to do....,MarvelDiceMasters,ch3a82c,1,t5_30tle

986165,0,t3_25d4na,I put my cards I will use sleeved in an ultra pro Mana Flip deck box.  My duplicates will go into a folder for trading.  Unused nonduplicates will go into another deck box at home.    I keep my dice in a small  parts box from the local hardware store.,MarvelDiceMasters,chgduzo,2,t5_30tle

1124775,0,t1_chw5015,I dont think there is anything in the rulebook that says this or supports it. Its just a ruling made by the rules team.,MarvelDiceMasters,chw59lm,1,t5_30tle

1144369,0,t1_chycnnq,Yeah abandoned communities can be snagged but it usually takes some proof the no mods deleted creator is a pretty good indicator though. It happens a lot sadly but we want to make sure the community stays strong. I would have requested it sooner if Id really thought about it.Were working on it and then well vote.,MarvelDiceMasters,chycq8u,1,t5_30tle

1198974,0,t1_ci4axvh,Tabletop Simulator works by uploading images to the simulator via the web. So yes you can have a complete collection online if you have an image of all the cards. I was able to find images for a lot of cards but it seems like the action cards are more difficult to find. ,MarvelDiceMasters,ci4i47c,2,t5_30tle
