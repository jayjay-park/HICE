1574943,0,t1_cjdofk4,Yep! The project is so huge its sometimes slightly overwhelming. PBasically there has been a recent WorldPainter update which has removed the previous restriction on world size  so I just decided to expand the world out to its full  square kilometre extent.Though you might not have noticed Ive revamped the southern Blue Mountains and laid out Harlindon in the last month so theres also that in terms of progress.,worldpaintingarda,cjdp09q,1,t5_2ybew
