8033,0,t1_cefc8ox,Ill give you that danger close gives explosives a lot of range but it does cost  points.  The danger close explosives kill me as a shielder too.  C can be thrown far but you have to look up to get more distance so if you stay away from the shielders you can shoot them in the feet when they do this. But recently Ive had times where I throw C by a an enemy or multiple enemies and not even get a hit marker.  The C did not miss it was right at there feet and there should be no way it doesnt kill or at least hit.  I understand it can be frustrating to die to as I die a good deal from BSbad lag comp regardless of my class.  I dont play SnDSnR much but prefer SnD. I agree explosives shouldnt be replenished in an SnR respawn.  Like I said I mainly play Dom and this allows me to cap and give myselfmy team a better chance at winning.  ,CODGhosts,cefcn1t,1,t5_2wp1x

But it helped my aim and honed my ears when u slow down like that so close to the enemy. Very satisfying when the slow prowl works.  Especially when theres a ladder nearby.

I decided it wasnt quite good enough and needed the actual patches in it to be  useful so I spent the last couple of days updating it and about  hours later I finished.Now Im aware the patches arent the best quality something about google drives compression software makes them lose quite a bit actually and that they arent all lined up nicely Not all the patches are the same size annoyingly but I hope itll do for you guys.In case you arent happy with the way I made it or you want to have a copy yourselves heres a mediafire link for you to download the spreadsheet yourselves. It was made on an Excel  spreadsheet.Hope you guys get as much use out of it as Ive been doing. Oh and if you find an error in the spreadsheet LET ME KNOW. Ive already had to make a couple of changes from my post  days ago so Im still not certain Ive got every patch right.HarkUPDATE I made some ammendments to the spreadsheet and also produced a text based version of the spreadsheet.

145120,0,t3_1vqjvm,First study the maps. Learn the entire map and decide on a playing style for each of them. IMO one size class setupplay style does not fit all wGhosts. Second AR dominance know that an AR will beat out and SMG about  of the time.Smaller Maps SMGShottys mainly SMGs. SMGs wrapid fire to be able to compete wARs that extra  bullets out of your gun quickly has in many cases been the deciding factor in many a gun fight. Dead Silence and Sitrep are my most valuable perks. Dead Silence to give you an extra couple of steps in range to make your SMGs effective...Sitrep for IEDs enough said. This is the setup that is more conducive to Runngun and probably the only time that it will be a viable playing style...not applicable to medlarge maps.Medium to Large Maps ARLMGs. I believe the LMGs to be extremely underrated. They are accurate as hell with a rediculous magazine capacity. Lightweight is a great perk to run wthem makes you feel like youre running around wan AR. DONT camp...play objectively but cautiously. Find the major traffic lanes in objective based games and go to town.

179206,0,t3_1w4rtq,Hi there!In Squads you can play either by yourself or with others against squads from other players depending on the game mode. You can create your own squad of soldiers then take them into battle online against other players squads  or go in with coop pals and battle bots together. All the XP you earn in Squads mode goes toward your main multiplayer XP level. Each of your created squad members levels up and Prestiges individually. You can even set up your squad to battle online while youre not around  and theyll earn XP while they wage war against other squads. There are some advantages over playing squads which our community manager outlined here that can help in the transition into multiplayer. Clans can participate in Clan Wars amp the Clan v Clan playlists in order to boost up their rank and get some pretty sweet options for character amp profile customization such as the much desired Body Count gear. Hope this helps clear up the difference between Squads and Clans. If there is something youre still not quite sure on feel free to reach out to us. Were here to help!MD ,CODGhosts,ceyuhj3,2,t5_2wp1x

All I want is a fair game and when you put  randoms against a clan of  youre going to get destroyed. For example last night I played with a team that was all running support streaks and they had an Oracle up nearly  of the  games I stayed in the lobby. One oracle would end and the next would start. Basically the entire team knew where  of our players were at all times. The game was pointless.

To me the biggest problem with the call of duty community is that everybody bitches about everything when they get killed how they got killed and how the other person plays camperdefender it so annoying I hate when people on my team bitch. In most cases I will ask people to stop complaining because its so annoying to everybody not just myself. Some of my best friends are my friends list have been people Ive asked to stop bitching in game.My uMad video talking about game rage  To me if I make somebody pull out their tube because of my play style that Im disrupting their game and to me thats a tactical advantage. Because am sure the kill streaks they have on that class and the perks they are using dont suit their play style so its fine by me.The key thing about people bitching is that they might just suck at call of duty and its not the other person.TLDR  Stop bitching its annoying,CODGhosts,cfad9ns,5,t5_2wp1x

Terrible class setups that made no sense. Stuff like Fully Loaded  Scavenger.

339074,0,t3_1xz459,Hi Fallen I play the game everyday and have above average stats. So let me try to answer your questions Map designs in Ghosts are different from previous CODs as in they are a lot bigger and have more flanking routes than say the regular three lane maps. However there are some good maps in the game like Strikezone Octane Freight etc. The key is just adapting and knowing the spawns. So dont let it put you off too much. There are a selection of assault rifles SMGs Marksman rifles snipers and shotguns to choose from. However this game mainy due to map layout and size favours assault rifles more than the other types of weapons. The graphics are decent on the PS but so sometimes struggle with framerate issues. However its no where near the graphics like BF on the PC or even on the PS. Its acceptable though. Ranking up takes a long time in this game. That shouldnt put you off however as you are not really missing out on anything.  Hit registration is very good in this game. It has the best hit detection and hit registration than any other COD ive played. This is what makes me like this game so much. Very fluid and very good hit detection. If you have good aim and reflexes you will not suffer. I would say the game is fun especially if you run specialist and go for KEM strikes participate in clan wars or even play in the clan vs clan playlist which is a more competitive playlist using rules from the pro circuit. I would say the worse things about this game as of right now are the spawns and the danger close C shield abuse. But that it going to get nerfed soon. The spawns though still really does need improving.Hope that helps a bit!,CODGhosts,cffwyjv,5,t5_2wp1x

However the jet ammunition has a lower muzzle velocity than typical lead bullets and will deal decreased damage depending on your distance to the target. This weapon cannot equip AP rounds and has very high default magnification. In case you arent following this weapons damage curve is reversed when compared to every other weapon. The further you are from your target the more damage each shot does. The M Firestorm | LMG | A slow firing machine gun designed to let the wielder slack off in a firefight. Specially designed bullets explode on impact essentially firing tiny grenades at the enemy. Think the BAR from World at War. This LMG would closely resemble that one in function small magazine and slow rate of fire high recoil and damage. Direct impact will do something between  and  damage. Indirect hits via the small explosions will deal    damage. Possibly OP. But it sounds cool. The M Bitch | Assault RifleSMG hybrid | This weapon has a revolutionary design! Two separate weapons fused into one will allow the wielder to quickly adjust to a changing battlefield! It would essentially be an assault rifle with an underbarrel SMG. The SMG could not be silenced so it does not make this an all in one weapon. It also hits lower than where the player is aiming when in use so players will surely be hitting the groin region when aiming for the belly.I have others but they powercreep existing weapons like the MK. However the MK is horrible. Just imagine a slugfiring shotgun that fires explosive slugs that can be detonated at your choosing replacing the lethal slot. To balance it can only carry  |  ammo max is  |  with extended mags.,CODGhosts,cfptt8g,2,t5_2wp1x

446348,0,t3_1z5cp9,at a point . KD I cant really discern how you play or what you like to use so I will go into general tips.Use quick or Stalker with ready uppersonally I believe stalker is better but it is a preference. Use focus all the timeunless your really amazing at drop shotting or jump shots.Use Dead Silence so you can be sound whored and if you use a headset use amplify to sound whore. At a . kd I doubt you having a great time getting any assault killstreaks so run support and support your teamget sat com vest and ground gammer or oracle youd be surprised how much better you can do if your teams doing well also. Slow your pace down if your constantly running into places and getting shot up its not because you reaction time is badit could be that but its most likely because your going rambo style. I would even recommend not sprint at all in a few games to see how much of a difference it can make then learn when its safe to sprint on not. Learn to use coverif you do end up using stalker remember you can strafe quickly while shootingand if you near cover and strafing back and forth behind it then thats even better. Id say use a gun your comfortable withbut if its something like the ARX or cjb lets try something different if you can remain on target try the ak or honey badger. Work on map awarenesswhere you are in comparison to where you enemies are I read somewhere to treat it like a triangle see where you are on the map and where you team is then you can more easily guess where enemies are coming in from.Last TipDont Camp your never going to get better and a action fps game if you dont take action and just sit in a corneryea you may die alot but you learn and adjust.,CODGhosts,cfr11zo,2,t5_2wp1x

467277,0,t1_cftblhr,gtNo they do not. If youyour team understand how the spawns work they will never flip. If you dont want them to and youre good enough to keep the other team from pushing far enough in. If youre that good its not going to matter whether its two  minutes rounds or one ten minute round especially in pubs. Youre going to win and snow what you want. gtI swear to god Im talking to a wall. I once again ask have you ever played Domination in a competitive environment? Not pubs competitive? Theres a reason MLG uses two five minutesided Dom and not  point Dom.   What the fuck does competitive Domination matter? You keep trying to turn it to that. No it doesnt make it more balanced. Maybe when youre talking two top level teams who have intimate knowledge of spawn points etc but in pubs its a nonissue. It doesnt create balance unless those parameters are met which simply do not exist in pub matches.And when those factors arent met it actually causes less balance since it essentially ends games much earlier.,CODGhosts,cftdq22,-1,t5_2wp1x

Ive done it I know its possible to lay down scoot back and avoid fire from people below you and just popping up and picking them off. Ive camped that spot with IEDs on the stairs when I was learning the layout of the maps. Ive changed my game style a lot since then but its very easy to do. Im not saying its a gamebreaking feature Im saying creating an advantage on a player that already has a geographical and cover advantage as well as a gun that will kill in  bullets as opposed to someone else who has to look in the bushes the broken hotelhouse thing and in the tower already. From across the map thats damn near impossible to keep that tower in mind with all of the other spots that map has. Its too much of an OP idea on an already powerful class of gamers.

No.  It was actually a change they implemented on youtube that changed the way the Search Algorithm Worked I went from almost k Views a day to under k over night.  and I could never get back to where I was.What I was saying though is theres many people who have huge sub bases who jsut to spite another person will get many of them to dislike another persons video every time he posts it.  Im not talking  or  dislikes Im talking Hundreds of  dislikes within the span of a few minutes.  It happened to me once because I called whiteboy out for the Bitch he was Within  mins of that video going up it had like  dislikes it even got removed at one point from my channel because he didnt want a video of someone talking about him.Its one thing to do it as a Job its another go develope a God Complex because of how many  year olds watch you play Call of Duty and literally coming up with plans to whore out your subbase for money.

663342,0,t1_cgfj0e6,Hi there!There is a difference between spawn trapping amp spawn camping. My colleague SL commented on this a few weeks ago to clarify the difference. Spawn trapping is where users exploit the spawn system to kill enemies the moment they spawn before they can move from their spawn location. This situation is almost impossible for the losing team to get out of. As this is considered to be an exploit it is a bannable offence.Spawn camping is a situation in which a team controls points on the map to force spawns in a certain area. This is not a violation of any rules. This involves a lot of teamwork and can be overcome if the other team works together to oppose it.There is more info regarding this in the thread I linked so check that out when you get a chance.

When you have the DLC installed do you have it saved to the same hard drive as the game or do you have it saved on a flash drive?If youve got it saved on multiple drives when you reinstall be sure to install them both on the hard drive. Besides that Id recommend reseating the hard drive before you attempt to reinstall.Once you try this if the issue still occurs please let us know this may be something we need to send forward to Infinity Ward to investigate.Thank youSL,CODGhosts,cgzh11m,1,t5_2wp1x

Theres also the constant complaint of parties and tryhards in pubs. Every week we see countless why is there so many parties in Ghosts??! Clan Wars ruined pubs etc etc. Well Treyarch with competitive in mind made League Play a specific place where these kind of players could go and regular players like this guy in this very thread could turn the game on and fuck around online with our friends for a few hours. with a much lower chance of being bothered by previously mentioned players in regular pubs.

In your privacy settings at the dashboard go to custom and set it so that only your friends are able to see your online status.. If you feel like going over the top you can also set your status under profile to appear offline.You will still be able to send and receive invites from clan members through the clan list in game as well as by going to gamercards. Following these steps will prevent anyone from directly following you.As for people following randoms that in your lobby youll just have to find a new lobby.

965451,0,t1_che0jzo,Honestly there is no best order. For the ones you need Id recommend running Ready UpMarathonAgilityDead Silence for point blank and slide. Those perks will let you get up close to enemies without being heard from there you can just hip fire them for the point blank. Just keep on the move with those you will find yourself behind the enemy a lot throughout the match from there you can just slide before you kill them. With lean you need to find a good spot and just exploit it. Its a bit campy but youre going for challenges. Tracker sight helps alot with lean kills give it a shot.,CODGhosts,che14hk,1,t5_2wp1x
968853,0,t3_256yq7,Likes I actually like the maps.  I have always preferred the bigger maps in every COD. The gun balance is better than previous IW games. Not perfect by any means but better. The character creation is great.  Ghosts and BO both did an awesome job with this. Hit detection and lag comp are spot on on XB at least. Game audio is great.  IW has always done a great job with footsteps and general movement sounds. I love Extinction. The DLC maps have been excellent for the most part. I really like having  squad members that dont completely reset every prestige.Dislikes TTK is too damn fast.  I thought the Heavy Duty mode had the TTK about right. Guns need to be harder to use.  More recoil more negatives to balance the positives of each gun. The game needs more color not BO level cartoony but less washed out. No theater mode. No Mercenary mode.  I play solo mostly and no Merc sucks. Knifing needs to be overhauled.  The standard knife should be  dmg max but a knifing classperks should be added for knifers. I prefer score streaks to kill streaks.,CODGhosts,chef2j1,10,t5_2wp1x

1386418,1,t1_ciptgpm,I have some female friends on my xbox live list that play this game along with my girlfriend who lives with me plays it from time to time. Id say women get it the hardest for some reason. Which is really unfortunate because apparently  of gamers now are girls. Usually when a bunch of us play online with one or two girlfriends of ours we make it known really quick that NOBODY will be talking shit to them.What I also find is now that you can pick your gender I notice TONS of female gender choices in game but they dont even bother plugging their mics in. Which means these are probably actual women in real life but just dont want to deal with the shit and abuse.I personally blame the gaming industry itself for the amount of shit women get I dont think women have ever been portrayed properly within video games themselves and are usually just typecasted as bimbos for the fatslob basement dwelling male gamer population. So therefore your average lippy  year old boy doesnt get it anyway. Things are obviously changing more and more now but its not happening as fast as it should not to mention games are always typically malecentric. For example its now  and Assassins Creed Unity apparently still wont have a female gender choice. Call of Duty specifically has always been bad for this until Ghosts but even the storylines hardly feature any proper female protagonists or antagonists oh wait there was the generic typecast cyberhacker girl in Black Ops . What deep character. But its not just the gender equality issue I find with Call of Duty games...

1728336,0,t1_cjwzdk6,I use the riot shield in combination with the throwing knife which makes objective play in domination pretty easy actuallyor at least for me being used to it. Capping flagholding objectives when you have a shieldthrowing knife is amazingly easy once you get used to it.Been using the throwing knife for so long now there isnt much aim involved its just reflex throwing for me at this point just as much as it would be for someone quickscoping. I dont have the best of internet connections which sometimes throws off the aim a good bit but generally when that happens I can account for lag enough to get the kills and flags when they count.Atm the knife is sitting at  used  kills and  hits. The very initial part of leveling I was stuck using the M so I could get the squad points to unlock the perks I needed for my shieldknife class but after that it was pretty much always shield. Very rare circumstances I swapped back to the gun. Total kills is  Just under  with the Mdisapointed with myself that I used it for as long as I did getting the squad points and all that being the only other thing Ive ever actually unlocked to use. Rest of them are probably a combination of dogs ims sentry guns and my trusty tactical knife. I dont know of a way to check kill streak specific kills.Before I reset I had over  throwing knife killsactually closer to  or so but over  is so much fun to say.

I dont mind the lack of three lane maps although I despise some maps such as Stonehaven and Stormfront. If youre complaining about too many entrances into every room youre probably just camping too much.   The beauty of this game is the absolutely spoton hit detection and netcode. I mean no other COD games runs this smoothly for me. Yes this does contribute largely to the TTK being insanely quick but I dont mind that either. When I am shooting someone I want them to die as quickly as possible. There are far fewer of those WTF????? moments with Ghosts than any other COD.   People also complain about the lousy streaks but I prefer games which dont focus on killpointscore streaks anyway. For me its mostly about the gun play.   The one thing I dont like is the spawning. Its often bad in these games but its exceptionally awful in Ghosts. I have spawned multiple times in a row in the cross hairs of the person who just killed me. ,CODGhosts,cv8yo8z,2,t5_2wp1x
