658886,0,t1_cgf5mzy,I dont want to give too much away here and now but its set in a pretty typical pseudomedieval fantasy world. A mercenary and his mage and rogue companions take on missions to keep the kingdom safe but discover a greater dark power working behind the scenes.Im aiming for grim and gritty like Mark Lawrences Broken Empire  trilogy but with wryly humorous character interactions like in David Eddingss books. ,gaygeek,cgf5y2l,2,t5_2rnja
