4894118,0,t1_cubdzms,It was. Im thirty now and live a couple thousand miles from there. I swear I hate that fucking room. I swear I try to make sense of it and have never been able to. I still write pretty much everything off paranormal. But I just cant shake this because I know what I saw. The best I came up with is I was in a half sleep half wake state and hallucinated it then some sort of mass paranoia broke out. That still doesnt explain my sister sleepwalking and then her friend seeing the same thing with no mention of it. My dad laughs about it and was always into some spooky shit. Like Crowley and Don Juan teachings. Which is a great read if anyone wants to dig into the folklore of it more. The teachings of Don Juan is where I would start. There are lots of others though. Basically an old native shaman eating mescaline and talking about how people use to be able to turn into animals and travel in dreams. Cool stuff. ,skinwalkers,cubfy8m,1,t5_2x5ns

6478680,0,t3_42ma8g,Dunno about in real but in the books I think Bob says that theres a difference between skinwalkers that are just mortal shamans that did some fucked up shit to get skinwalkery powers and Shagnastys folks.  Sort of like the different flavors of werewolf in Fool Moon.,skinwalkers,czpfyeb,2,t5_2x5ns

8858250,0,t3_51fqfo,This operates under the assumption that all gun owners are responsible competent and when confronted have ample time to ensure the firearm is loaded safety is off and they can assume a comfortable stance from which to fire accurately at their target.Firearms are little more complicated than point and click technology. ,skinwalkers,d7cmx69,4,t5_2x5ns

9793712,0,t1_daem5o5,I really have no clue.  The front and back doors had deadbolts and the windows like most windows on the rez had bars in front of them.  My best guess is that maybe I forgot to lock the door.  What happened was my eldest woke up one night hearing something and turned on the light.  He told me he looked down the hall and saw the reddish gold glowing eyes at the other end of the hall and set into a darkened shape.  Ran straight back into bed and hid under the covers.  It took him  years to actually talk about this as an adult.  I do know that he was seriously afraid of skinwalkers growing up out there to the extent that he never opened his curtains even in daytime.  He wouldnt even enter his room at night if the curtains were open.   They are pretty dang scary. ,skinwalkers,dakacje,3,t5_2x5ns
