1724822,0,t1_cjwim9i,Okay so my curiosity got the better of me and implored me to look this up. And the answer is quite cool!What is believed now is that clownfish are protected from anemone stings using a combination of innate and acquired immunity. Clownfish produce their own mucous that contain chemical components antigens that prevent some species of anemone from firing their cnidocysts. For species of anemone that clownfish dont have innate protection against they are initially stung. But that exposure allows them to acquire and incorporate antigens from that anemone into their mucous to protect itself.Its almost like the clownfish vaccinates itself against anemone stings.Source here,SmarterEveryDay,cjwkttd,3,t5_2sm2u

4498995,0,t1_csxkm9d,My first thought was this too. In terms of feasibility however it could be though cos you need space to ride a bike you need to consider safety and I figure people would want to have a couple of goes on the bike. So even with a couple of bikes of differing sizes you might have difficulty.However I also thought that you could expand upon the idea of these physical things which are hardwired into our heads. Perhaps a mouse and keyboard where the locations of the keys have been flipped so that what was qwerty is now poiuyt. To go with this you could have a mouse where direction was inverted so pushing from left to right sends the curser from right to left which is i think a better analog to the bicycle. Easier to implement might be asking people to write the mirror of what they would normally write. Maybe some program with an touchscreen device and a stylus? Though these ideas could all supplement the bike instead of supplanting it.,SmarterEveryDay,csxr4ci,15,t5_2sm2u

I go to SmarterEveryDay youtube channel to learn and entertain myself on science related topics and not to hear about issues I hear from TV newspaper or rworldnews etc. So Destin asking Obama about learning ethics or space exploration is very appropriate to me and Im relieved there was no strictly political or social issues.

Ive listened to  few podcasts with  people and it was virtually impossible to follow the thread of who was talking as there were just too many voices.I think the big sticking point might be content.    You already have a great video channel so I would think that you would want this to be somewhat different from that?

10582621,0,t3_5rfi95,The spinning blades under the surface are a little wobbly which pushes some of the mud against the side of the bucket down near the blades. The side of the bucket is fighting to get back inward back to its original position. When the wobble in the stirring blades allows a section of the side to reset it pushes some mud toward the center. The mud near the blades is spinning quickly enough that it doesnt move toward the center but the bottom of the bucket wont let that mud go down so it pushes up and displaces some of the mud on top.The mud on top isnt spinning fast enough to overcome the sides pushing toward the center so it starts inward while the mud from below pushes up forming the waves that look like rose petals.At one point the drill speeds up enough that a little mud makes it out.Thats what I see happening here. ,SmarterEveryDay,dd7ikpt,1,t5_2sm2u
