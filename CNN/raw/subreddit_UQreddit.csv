4649496,0,t3_3ena7l,Individual rooms are not as busy as some people have said here. I usually get a room if I try to book the day before or  days before. The group rooms are far more popular get booked out within hours of opening up. Bookings open  days earlier so a pm room on wednesday will open up for booking at pm the week prior.My top preference when booking are the Zelmanarchmusic library Individual rooms. There are only four in the library but theyre the most privatesoundproof. They have computers and some desk space and theyre not as busy as the other libraries. The Zelman library is also close to the engineering side of the uni not too far from Hawken or Advanced Engineering Building. The Dorothy Hill Engineering library individual rooms are smaller but have more desk space than Zelman. Theres  of them and theyre pretty much always filled out during the middle of the day. These rooms are also strictly individual librarians come round and check if theres more than one person.The individual rooms in the Duhig Tower are massive twice as big as the others and have  chairs but the building is too far out of the way for me to ever use them. The law library individual rooms are my least favourite but probably the best chance you have if you want to book an individual room an hour or two before.,UQreddit,ctgmqp2,1,t5_2r59t

6739882,0,t3_47zj6t,Bike boxes are free if you dont want a locker and I usually just leave my sweaty clothes looped around my lock and toiletries in a small clear bag in my basket anyway so little need for one IMO. Just need to fill in a form at prentice and tick all the boxes you want access to. I use the A which is relatively ok and has showers and toilets and PACE which is the pharmacy library that is usually pretty empty and I use to study on week days but no showers there.,UQreddit,d0ggmrz,3,t5_2r59t

10365265,0,t3_5o927w,My girlfriend has just gone through the same thing as you over the last year.  She didnt get into UQ science even though she had the OP for it due to the lack of prerequisite courses she had not done any of the sciences in high school.  She talked to an adviser at UQ who recommended she reapply for a bachelor of environmental management which she got into before semester started.  This allowed her to pretty much select all the same courses as she would have in a BSc and when she had done the prerequisites and transferred to BSc she was able to get credit for the courses she had completed.  This may be a viable option for you or to do the same thing with arts by just doing elective courses and doing your science pre requisites or any science courses you would like while applying for transfer at the end of first semester based on GPA which is not a high requirement.,UQreddit,dciyqvg,1,t5_2r59t
