5316922,0,t3_3n47qd,I was very happy to see this episode because the enemy is one of my alltime favourite Ultra series bad guys. I was also happy that he hasnt lost any threat level since his last appearance Max really had to pull out all the stops to take him down. As it should be!Not mentioning monster names to avoid spoiling.,Ultraman,cvrasb8,1,t5_2s9mi
8582711,0,t1_d67fjdr,Yeah hes charismatic although they are leaning a bit too hard on the western tropes with him. Right now hes by far the most appealing human character on the show.,Ultraman,d6efalu,1,t5_2s9mi
