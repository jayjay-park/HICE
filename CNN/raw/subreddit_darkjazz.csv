7061619,0,t1_d131sto,gt The Twin Peaks soundtrack is what brought me to this subSame.  I kind of hate to admit I havent explored this sub as much as Id like.  But I do so enjoy Angelos compositionsalso David and Angelos compositions.I like that video too.  Where they talk about a girl in the woods.  Its borderline sexual but its a composition.  Theres a rise climax and release.  Its great.,darkjazz,d1gsn60,1,t5_2ssrv
