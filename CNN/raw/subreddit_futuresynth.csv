2593975,0,t3_2phb95,The ending is definitely my favorite and the strong point of the song. Not sure if its great because its such a break from the rest of the track or because its catchy and smoothwarm also. Id try adding that melody in somewhere earlier on in the song maybe. Props for creating this. Getting back into making music myself. Takes a lot of time and effort to make and finish a single song. Keep it up man!,futuresynth,cmx6487,1,t5_2v8qd
2622122,0,t3_2px9vq,What kind of computer do you have? How much are you willing to spend? How dedicated are you to spend a lot of money? Do you have a background in music already? Just questions you need to answer in order to get a better idea as to what you are looking to do.  In my experience starting out with hard to use DAW is not the best route but it helped me understand things better in the long run. I am a pc user and currently use ableton reason fruity loops and Adobe audition to craft the sounds I want. A good app to use to make sketch tracks ideas is Figure. There are some other apps to use with your iPadiphoneiPod but Im only familiar with figure imaschine and the official moog app. Check my music here to see the type of music I makewww.soundcloud.comdjstilz,futuresynth,cn0ukpu,2,t5_2v8qd

It shuffles and glitches flashes of neon topaz and dayglow blacklight echoing along the deserted boulevards and promenades.  The few remaining folk cower behind crumbling doorways the sign of the Last Warrior painted on the wall to ward off the lurking nightmare that throbs and howls its defiant song to the trembling hearts of a hundred forgotten souls.
