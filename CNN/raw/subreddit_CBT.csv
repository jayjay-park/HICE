10582991,0,t3_5ri6bc,This might sound disheartening but you might not see any improvements for years. For me personally I had to see a therapist for about  years before I saw any improvement in my anxietypanic disorderOCD. But then again I started therapy fairly young. I imagine that age and brain development has a lot to do with what youll pick up on. You may also need to switch therapists. I had one that I liked a lot as a person but she didnt necessarily get through to me as much as others. If you want some tips on CBT from someone who has been there and done that send me a PM and Ill talk to you about whatever you like ,CBT,dd7jy8e,3,t5_2sxz7
