9229440,0,t3_56peyn, . Below is my competitive balance proposal as I posted in Slack a month ago.  Im not particularly attached to any of the specifics here but I think it is a good starting point for discussions if people feel like competitive balance or tanking rules are needed.gtEvery none playoff team is awarded an extra minor league competitive balance pick.  These picks are awarded at the start of every round and  per round.  So the first  picks of the first round are comp picks then the full first round then  comp picks then full second round etc.  The order of the picks is awarded by seeded lottery based off reverse record.  The lottery will be based off assigning numbers to each team and then selecting a random number for each pick.  gtTo discourage tanking each team will lose one of their numbers every time someone in their active lineup scores  points after a set date maybe August st.  This penalizes teams for tanking does not involve any judgement to what is and is not tanking and only amounts to serious penalties if they continually field noncompetitive teams. gtExamplegtLets say we award the worst team in the league  numbers out of a possible .  That gives them starting odds of .  However this team started  minor league players in their lineup for the last  games of the season.  That penalty equates to  lost numbers.  They now have  numbers out of a possible .  This brings their odds down to .  The actual numbers we use are obviously up for league debate.,redditdynasty2,d8lwdoc,2,t5_2v9sc
