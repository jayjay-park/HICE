10652251,0,t1_ddenk1t,I definitely agree with your appraisal bjj and judo have better quality control than most ju jitsu clubs and are more focused on competition and active sparring which is far more beneficial for self defence than running drills.And yeah shorinji kan is hardcore about breakfalls as a yellow belt I started cross training with judo and I was getting TONS of higher ranked judokas complimenting my ukemi. my throws were shit but my falls were great apparently haha.,Ju_Jutsu,ddep4pu,3,t5_2rlsk
