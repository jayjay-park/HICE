10173867,0,t1_dbx4vm7,I believe the villains still vote in the tribal council vote. The Villain vote is technically for a night action while the tribal council vote is a day action. We just have combined phases so I think villains will submit both of those votes each phase.,Chochanga,dbx9ika,5,t5_3hfkk

10215911,0,t3_5m45pp,You know what would be interesting? If uMalvidian and uPenultima were both evil and purposefully played up this feud in order to get us to suspect one of them. Then once one of them is dead people will believe the other person is innocent. Just food for thought.,Chochanga,dc214tt,3,t5_3hfkk

10230735,0,t1_dc3pjc9,Yeah my thought process was mostly that I suspected you more than mega and I was still thinking Korsola wouldnt have lied because she was innocent but she could have still lied. Regardless one vote just shifted away from you.  ,Chochanga,dc3pm04,2,t5_3hfkk

10247249,0,t1_dc5itmk,Hey even you stated to mega yesterday that our reasons for voting off kemkat were actually pretty sound. No you didnt vote for kemkat but dont go acting like you think it was unreasonable of us to vote for her just because she turned up innocent. I was following my own gut and Megas advice btw.Otherwise you have some very convincing points about TNTM. Im gonna feel bad if she ends up innocent but at least it will give her more uninterrupted time with her puppy?Guess Im voting for her unless something else comes along...,Chochanga,dc5kzbg,5,t5_3hfkk
