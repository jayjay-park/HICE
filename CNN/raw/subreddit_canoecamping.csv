It will take some serious punishment and come out no worse for wear. Things to look for does the wood seats and thwarts look to be rotting? Roll the canoe over and look at the shape  does the bottom of the canoe seem to sluff down into itself. When you press on it is it really floppyjolloppy? Go look at a new one in a store and see how its looks and feels new. For your pickup truck If you dont already have a piperacktruck box or the like I highly recommend getting a truck bed extender You can just lay the canoe down in the bed of the truck and the hanging end gets supported well with this thing. Alternatively if you have lots of gear you want to throw in you can flip it around and load one end of the canoe on the cab and this thing will support the other end. Its by far the easiest most versatile and cheapest option for canoepickup carry. Other suggestions Go to the library and see what they have in terms of canoe camping. If you can find path of the paddle and song of the paddle get them. They are older and some of the gear suggestions are outdated but the books are fantastic and are great intros into the world of canoeing. Song of the paddle talks about camping path of the paddle talks about how to paddle a canoe. Cliff Jacobson has written a couple good newer books as well Canoeing Basic Essentials and Canoeing and Camping Beyond the Basics Also something like this book may be usefull Paddle Indiana but Im not in IN so I cant speak for it. Note If these books arent at your nearest public library find an actual librarian not a page usually at the reference or circulation desk and ask to ILL them InterLibrary Loan. Basically every library in the US does this and usually for free. It will take a few days to a couple of weeks for the books to show up then youll get to check them out for a week or two before they have to be sent back to the lending library. Sometimes you can extend that time. Its a great way to check out a book before buying it.,canoecamping,cumz31n,2,t5_3095o
