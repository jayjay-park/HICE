2947176,0,t1_co33che,Then wife accident.  Ended up going back into another field.  Depression.  Motorcycle wreck.  Recovery.  Truck rear ended another rough time.  Took a few years to run through all that!  I am still finding stuff.  A Cannon mold with blocks and C bout ribs.  A top partially made for something.  There are still a few boxes to go through.  I think one is full of old tools from my grandfathers place that need restoring.  I may do that for my partner.  She needs tools and the steel is usually good.  I use my great grandfathers tools all the time!  Theres certainly a great deal of joy in working wood.,violinmaking,co33wao,1,t5_35fv0
