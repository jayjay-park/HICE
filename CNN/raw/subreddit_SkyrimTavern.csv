But... he continued You could try the notice board. Might be something there. Curious enough Vier went up to the noticeboard posted outside and scanned it closely.Hmmm... Wolves... missing persons... stolen sweetroll... AHA! This looks interesting. Something caught his interest as he hastily ripped it off the wall.Troll hunting eh? Vier read the note carefully.

9364787,0,t1_d92bkua,Davmyn who was quite drunk and dozing at this point feet stretched out before him and arms crossed as he snored softly snapped awake at the sound of... was it singing? The Dunmer covered his ears in ire and glared up at the stage. Dimly he recognized one of the performers as Soraya. The womer who had taught him such a useful spell on the shores of Lake Illinalta. Next to her was another extremely pale AltmeruBenjaminCanckersore. He remembered reading somewhere once before that Altmer had a habit of infanticide when the babe displayed unappealing features.He was quite happy to see that this was not so as the practice was barbaric and foul.He was wishing that it was as his ears were assaulted.Davmyn growled fiercely as people began to throw eggs. While he did want the singing to stop which the egg throwing marvelously did he was less than enamored as one of the citizenry had drawn far too close and at his growl dropped his egg over top the Dunmers head.He was quiet for several long moments. Very very quiet. The egg atop his head began to sizzle and pop as his baleful glare turned murderous. And then another egg its origins unknown sailed and smacked him right in the face.The Dunmer erupted into flames as his wrath poured forth boosted by the simmering rage of his Ancestors who were likelu equally offended by the foolery occuring around.You Nwah! roared Davmyn and before he could begin lobbing fireballs in every direction several Imperial soldiers surrounded him.Stop right there! Shouted one of the soldiers this one in heavy officer armor. You dont want to be criminal scum Dunmer. You refugees are always causing problems.Davmyn indignant at being referred to as a refugee snarled at the so called civilized enforcers of Law.The fool dropped an egg on me! He began and the flames around the Dunmer began to flicker away. Why shouldHe was suddenly tackled from behind by a Haafingar guard that had come to assist.Weve got him Imperials. This is Haafingar and Solitude said the guard hauling up the thrashing Dunmer. We handle drunks all the time. Just needs some time to cool his Dark Elf head off. Off we go!DUNMER! I am a Dunmer fool! Not a Dark Elf!The guard along with several others hauled the still raging Dunmer away leaving the scowling Imperials behind.

9537462,0,t1_d9ojxpg,Shuddering briefly at the chill from the open door Bjorn drew his jacket closer around him. The simple brown hide and his linen clothes were comfortable but offered little in the way of warmth. His cloak hung by the doors and he half considered walking over to pick it up when the adventurer caught his eye. The Argonian was a credit to his species  an obviously strong male in scored armor showed the old Nord the newcomer knew his way around a fight. He tapped the rim of his tankard against his teeth thoughtfully. News from the surrounding lands had been scarce recently  a fact he attributed to the dragoninfested roads and rumors of a Dragonborn. Civilians were hardpressed to find reason to leave their homes. This Argonian had obviously been abroad and judging from the state of his gear and the telltale signs of fatigue was looking for a warm fire and a few days of rest. Hopefully what news he had was worth the price  Bjorn rapped his knuckles on the bar.The Argonian he jerked his head to the corner as the wanderer nursed his mug and settled in. Send him a bowl of whats in the kettle a few mugs of whatever he wants and a loaf of that rye. If he asks tell him who paid. Put it on the tab.Hulda gave a soft chuckle. At this rate youre going to be more penniless than I am you old goat. She teased as she motioned a new waitress over for the food and drink. Bjorn grinned broadly  she knew he was sweet on her and never failed to jibe him whenever she had a spare moment.For you Hulda Id be as broke as Brenuin. he snorted lightly taking a deep draft of his wine.,SkyrimTavern,d9oovtc,2,t5_3fn6u

9764779,0,t1_da88dt2,He tilted his head slightly and watched the Netch float on by before he shrugged slowly and put his sword away letting the metal shink into its sheath with nothing more than a cursory shake to ensure it wasnt loose or sticking. Either situation had the potential to be bad.I... Vaguely recall a story something involving House Dres and a rebellion said Davmyn carefully. It was from the days when slavery was quite rampant in his homeland and he knew that most other races thought poorly of it. Something involving sending out Netch herds over their besiegers and then exploding them.He shrugged softly and shook his head as he imagined it I personally would have no desire to witness such a thing myself. Id imagine it to be very very messy.The Dunmer turned his path southwards and continued along the path that had been lain out. He was itching to break away because now on the horizon he could see the tell tale Emperor Parasols to the east. He could find the path from there... but the map insisted that they continue southwards rather than the more direct approach to the east through the remnants of blasted tree trunks from the eruption from nearly two centuries ago...Then again that was always a hotbed for gathering the Molag Mora wasnt it?He frowned deeply and turned his gaze away. He had no desire to see them off this path now. And that farmer would certainly be receiving more than what hed asked for for this path. Such a thing to travel across the southern ashlands of Solstheim with only one accosting by the native life? It was unheard of especially in the time that hed dwelt here. And if the Ashspawn were such a wretched problem these days he would have thought theyd easily have run across several of them by now.Instead they had a nice leisurely stroll to the coast line and were occasionally greeted with a call he had not heard since he had left Morrowind behind that of low mournful calls that echoed across the ashlands. A smile lightened his eyes and then he turned eastwards towards where his old home once was. Truth be told he was becoming almost... disappointed by the lack of anything. Hed known that his mother had exaggerated much of the danger as a child barring the wretched Ashstorms that would constantly plague the island when he was a small boy but... Now it seemed almost tame. Not quite the frontier land hed once been told again and again how there were any number of things waiting to kill any one of them that wandered freely from Tel Mithryn.Now it seemed almostToo easy.He followed the shoreline until there was an incline that led across a few rocky outcroppings and a small stream that trickled out into the Sea of Ghosts. The sun peeked itself through the clouds and ahead he could see the great caps of the emperor parasols and something that brought both dread and a sense of familiarity great twisting stalks shooting off the main body of the Sadrith Tel that branched out and gave way to smaller pods that were fitted with round doors that were set with iron fittings.Tel Mithryn was surprisingly the same as when he had left. A deep frown stole over his features as he looked up at the tower with his mind raging in a storm of emotions.That bastard really hadnt done a thing to grow his tower anymore? I suspected as much but this is absurd. One of the self proclaimed most powerful of Telvanni Wizards but thats just itTo his left now that he crested the rise he could see the giant that had made the low mournful calls of earlier. Atop of six long legs and towering next to the rise that had a platform leading to it was Dusty the old Silt Strider. Its body was like that of a giant flea rounded and with a brown carapace. He could see the cloth that had been stretched over the hollowed out part if its shell though by the time he had left Dusty was rarely used for transportation so old was the Silt Strider.Hes probably in there now he muttered softy fingers tightening around his hilt so tightly the netch leather of his gauntlets creaked. His eyes burned as he stared up at the tower. LailauDizzyRP did you know that this tower has not changed or been further grown in years? No expansion for his people no thought of what their needs may be. Take a good look. Do not allow me to do the same.Davmyn took a slow breath before looking at Sahiiruafriendlyhobo and began to say Well now we need to think up a distrA cry went up from the direction of the tower and he swung around to see a mass of ash that was barrel shaped in the torso with thick arms and a square head on top of a squat almost nonexistent head.What in Oblivion is that? he cursed beneath his breath. He could see two figures racing away from the monster and one of the two was cursing the other for a fool. The ash monster proceeded to blast a gout of ash from its hands as well as he would a flames spell from his own.Well we have a distraction at least,SkyrimTavern,dagq5fm,1,t5_3fn6u

Her hand lets go of Lailas with only a quick Lets go! before she runs off her feet making the smallest of foot prints in the snow. As she runs her bow slides off her back and into her hands a broad headed  bladed arrow finding its way to flax and wood.She skids to a stop as she gets in range and pulls her string back aiming for the briefest of seconds before letting fly hoping to at the very least distract the beast enough for the noncombatants to get out of certain danger. As soon as that arrow has let loose she readies another and fires once more.She waits for LailauDizzyRP to catch up before speaking. Ash and sulfur. she states as she lets loose again. Do you have any poisons that can combat it? The poison would log inside the ash this one things. Perhaps it will make the effect last longer if it is affected by poison in the first place.Another arrow flies out her hands moving as if they were some sort of Dwemmer machine with minds of their own. Fling! Off goes another one. Sahiir steals a glance as she watches Dav move off and scowls slightly. She wanted him to survive she knew this now. He held her reward afterall. ,SkyrimTavern,dah5fnj,1,t5_3fn6u

Background Hista though a Argonian He was born in Cyrodiil to a decently wealthy family around the Dragon Plaza that dealt in imports and exports and having there claws in other smaller businesses. His Father Jarul would always try to train Him in the family trade and would constantly try to low ball His works an rip people off when He could and His mother and Sister Meezka and Surnati  would of course do pretty much any sort of black mailing and if possible seducing to get there way and they also moved the obligatory stolen or illegal goods from time to time and greased imperial officials palms from time to time as well. Eventually weather it was there luck running out or the nine finally unleashing wrath on them one of there Dark Elf servants tired of the mistreatment and constant insults stole several papers an journals from around the third era after one of Jaruls inspections of Her from there hidden safe talking about the assassinations and horrific deadra worship carried out by Hista ancestor from that time.         Needless to say that getting out ruined the family name and business Hista realizing they where doomed and having been looking for a chance to travel took it and borrowed a couple thousand gold from the family buying gear and so forth and heading off to hopefully somewhere better. along the way to skyrim  He became interested in alteration after finding a traveling breton merchant selling scrolls and spell tomes and looking though the one for candle light the fact Hed not need torches to see in dark areas sounded to good to pass up and His interest in Alteration had only increased since and He noticed the Breton had a flute and a couple song books one the songs of black marsh the other the songs of Cyrodill He asked about them and the Merchant told Hista they where given to Him in trade after some farmer came up short for a healing potion or two and out of not having much to do Hista offered to buy the instrument  and books. though now He mostly plays the lute He has strapped to His back these days.        Attitude and personality crass crude playful and the most part light harted but also smart and cunning and able to quite convincingly put on a hire of nobility or class and is for the most part always tried wooing women though that has always gotten Him into plenty close calls an drunken misadventures. He unlike the rest of His family  doesnt hate dark elves though He does have a sight distrust an bigotry towards Thalmore or High Elves that traveled to Tamriel from the dominion seeing them as lying scamming opportunists. after almost being arrested by thalmor on false charges of Talos worship on His travels.

This was not why he came to Skyrim but his prey had alluded him for such a long time that the SubAetherial Spore message from his superiors had been rather incredulous. Even Elenwen had been surprised when he had arrived in the Embassy demanding clarification. I must admit despite my original misgivings of being temporarily reassigned said Manuviel as his gaze lingered on a sickly looking Nord. I look forward to bringing peace to so many. You are prepared for your endeavor?His gaze remained fully locked upon the man and for a moment some vestige of emotion slipped through those dead eyes. It was unidentifiable however.So many suffer as that man even if not as obvious he muttered to himself. What a wretched and broken world we live in...,SkyrimTavern,ddp7bly,1,t5_3fn6u
10761781,0,t1_ddpz9hp,With practiced ease as taught to those who wished to emulate the lessons of Blessed Mephala Davmyn approached the fort with LailauDizzyRP close to his side. He was thankful for the time they had spent traveling together and this wasnt much different than when they had navigated the halls of that Barrow pulled from some sociopaths wet dream.Less claustrophobic at least...His eyes narrowed at the sight of Argonians atop the walls and he noted as they scouted that those were all that occupied the fort. His attention slid to the trebuchet under construction with curiosity trying to quell the rage that was growing at the thought of a nest of the damned lizards being so close.He reached up to his shoulder as a phantom pain echoed its misery at him.Filthy lizards he cursed under his breath. His brows knit as he noted the pool on the side of the forts walls and quirked a brow. The learned expression had certainly become easier for him. Well if you were a scaleback... where would you look for a hole?,SkyrimTavern,ddpzy1d,1,t5_3fn6u
10918339,0,t1_de5i5dr,He watched the exchange between the two for a long moment crossing his arms beneath his cloak. The Dunmer was very tired at this point to the point of near giddiness something to which he would not admit and actually found the Redguard and the little mechanical spider comical. He tilted his head as she turned the conversation back to him and he pondered her questions for a long moment.He had contemplated making for Whiterun and the Bannered Mare though for some reason a lethargic pointlessness had come over him at the prospect. Too much effort with very little payout just to find himself somewhere that he would be given uncomfortable stares. He suddenly had little desire for his usual gracious treatment by Nords in a Nord city and the inviting if naive attitude of the Redguard woman.I was planning on locating a cave actually he said with a small shrug after a moment. It is sometimes more inviting when given the choice between the wilds that are openly hostile than the... veiled politeness of the locals.He shrugged softly at that a gentle lift of his shoulders that caused the wolven pelt mantled about his shoulders to appear as though the animal it was comprised of had stretched answering honestly If you so wish to make camp with me youre welcome to join. Though I have only a little game I managed to find to share.He had been very grateful when he had taken the rabbit meat two smaller specimens worth and a few carrots and spuds from the bandits he had happened across during his flight from the Reach with the real threat of bounty hunters behind him and the imagined threat of the Witchmen watching him always from the mists.,SkyrimTavern,de65e8y,2,t5_3fn6u
10998214,0,t1_deejxp6,Sahiir nods slowly as he speaks listening intently. Then it hit her. Hes always high... perhaps his memory was clouded by the mushrooms and sugar? Whatever the case it was not something she was about to explore with him not yet. It could be touchy and she needed him. Farewell Mohamdal. She says not bringing herself to say his new name. In greeting and in leaving it would feel wrong to do so. This one will come for you tomorrow. Be ready it will be a tough few days.As he turns and leaves she does the same leaving the dead where they lay. They were not her problem they would feed the earth no doubt. The circle of life and all that. For now? Now she had a Redguard to ravish before her mission in the morning. ,SkyrimTavern,deem48x,1,t5_3fn6u

11533156,0,t1_dg394om,Shamgar smiled very pleased with himself as he walked back up the corridor towards the party. The sounds of lovely music drew closer and closer as did the sounds of hundreds of voices all talking and laughing at once. Soon he rounded a corner and was met with a large ballroom packed full of guests each with either a snack or drink in hand sometimes both.Scanning his trained eyes over the large crowd he began to look for the Jarls as he made his way towards the refreshment table. ,SkyrimTavern,dg3aaam,1,t5_3fn6u
