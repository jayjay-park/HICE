9594092,0,t1_d9v3c5u,Oh yeah thats a good idea. You finish extracting the blood from the foot and toss the empty husk in the vague direction of the window trash chute. It doesnt land anywhere close but you dont particularly care enough to go pick it up instead you examine your surroundings.Currently youre in your meat locker closet where you keep your meat clothes. Thats where you are right now. Theres a bunch of meat hooks hangers everywhere hanging from the ceiling where you currently have a few bodies shirts hanging up. You keep it pretty cold in here because you feel like your lusus Mosquitoman is always trying to eat try on your food clothes and the cold keeps him out.Ok yeah you cant keep up the charade whoever saw you eating the foot knows youre not hiding clothes in here. These are your friends the ones who were generous enough to give you something to eat when you were hungry. They were really nice before you brought them here its a shame they wont be able to enjoy the rest of the tour.You decide to head to the kitchen next as Mosquitoman might be trying to take any food you left out. As you step in you lock the locker behind you to ensure Mosquitoman doesnt get in. The kitchen contains the basic necessities an oven to cook your meat and seasonings to season your meat. Theres also a table which you sit at sometimes but you very rarely willingly donate blood to Mosquitoman for dinner and even less often do you both eat together when you do. Theres a window in here but you usually keep the blinds down no need for anyone to see what youre up to. Next room.You head out the one other door leading to your foyer where the door outside stands silent waiting for the daily expedition for more meat. The room itself doesnt have much to it just a few pieces of furniture that no one ever sits at. Occasionally you knock them over during your strifes with Mosquitoman when he tries to take the key to the meat locker and sometimes you bother to fix them but most of the time they remain knocked over.You briefly ponder where to go next. You could go to the greenhouse but that rooms long dead. Your ancestor The Seedsman was supposedly a great raiser of animals and plants but you have no interest in following in his footsteps. Just leave the dead plants dead and leave the glass walls open to maybe have any wandering trolls think the hive is empty.Instead of heading into your dead garden you knock on Mosquitomans door before barging in anyways. His room is very disorganized much like your own but at least yours is relatively clean of blood. Mosquitoman keeps almost his entire floor drenched in the stuff all different colours strewn about mixing together to create a delicious mud of colours. As per usual he remains motionless as you enter focused entirely on his ceiling which had been replaced with a large bug zapper covered by a metal cage too tightly crunched together for him to fit between the bars. Its for his own good without the cage he would get himself killed.You briefly consider getting his attention but decide against it instead returning to your own respiteblock. Hive sweet hive. Your familiar respiteblock is a mess of shirts sopor slime and the occasional piece of FLARPing gear which you borrowed from some of your friends. You trudge through the mess to your desk where your husktop awaits with a message for you. A brief discussion distracts your tour for a moment but you quickly return to the description of your respiteblock. Aside from the mess on the floor there is also a wall mount of your beloved dagger the Bloodletter. So many wounds caused by that dagger and yet somehow you always manage to clean it off so it retains the same sparkling glow as the day you got it. The one thing youve earned for yourself rather than having it inherited from your ancestor stolen or donated by a friend.Here have map.Well that was quite the tour dont you agree?

10776721,0,t1_ddr7lsu,Well the civil was between the north and the south of America. The south wanted to become its own country mostly because it wanted to keep using slavery but the north said no. The north won. The world wars were two really big wars between a lot of big countries. The first one is kind of weird in how it was caused but the second one was from an evil genocidal dictator who we took down.orange,RPGStuck_C4S10_2,ddrjhmt,1,t5_3gmlc
