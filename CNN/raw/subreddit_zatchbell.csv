1334494,0,t3_29cz87,I agree with you very much. The manga was way better than the anime starting where the two diverged. The same goes for soul eater. ,zatchbell,cijqw8k,3,t5_2tgrq
1383116,0,t3_29cz87,Im an upcoming high school senior and im new to the whole world of manga. Ive never been a huge fan of manga and anime shows but i have always had a special place in my heart for Zatch Bell. I first saw the anime when i was really young on Toonami. I was pretty young so the memory of the anime faded away as i grew older. It wasnt until i stumbled upon a picture of Zatch on the internet cant remember where that the memory of the anime came back to me. I love things that make me feel nostalgic so naturally i became interested in the anime. I remember nothing about the show other than a few vague things so i decided i would start watching the show online starting from episode . I spent many nights bingewatching the show until i arrived at episode . To my dismay this was the last episode that was dubbed in English. Unfortunately for me i dont understand a lick of Japanese so i became disheartened. I know theres always the option to keep watching the later episodes with subtitles but it just isnt the same for me. I was so used to the american voice actors so hearing a different voice come out of the characters mouth muchless in a different language was not something i wanted to do. Quitting on the show was also not an option for me either so i resorted to reading the English manga. This is the first manga ill be reading and hopefully this will lead to me discovering other wonderful series. Anyways im completely in love with the Zatch Bell series and as a result ill be subscribing to this subreddit. It may be small but its great to be part of a community that likes Zatch Bell as much as i do if not more. ,zatchbell,cipno36,2,t5_2tgrq
