10956271,0,t3_5w9n17,I think that a certain type of vocal viewer is trying to hold the show to the standard of the comics. Thats where the whole everything is in his head comes from. While I wouldnt be completely floored if that ends up being the case I dont think it is. I think Noah Hawley just took an idea about a split personality powerful mutant and ran with it not necessarily adapting a comic series. To me the scene in the last episode where David was communicating with Lenny and everyone who was watching him could tell his brain was activating the speech centers but David himself looked like he was in a trance and unresponsive was a clear indication that Lenny is one of his alternate personalities living in his head and the other people at Summerland are not. They exist in the real world. I think Lenny is a personality that exists in his head as is the DYE and possibly the Angry Boy if the angry boy is not just another version of the DYE. There also might be some element of Syd that was absorbed when they switched bodies as evidenced by the scene where he still can feel her hair and the fact that she could see the DYE and Angry Boy but Syd also still exists in real life.,LegionFX,dea27vm,2,t5_3e713

Benny is the dude that made David get high and was a bad influence whilst he was going to the psychologist. He met Lenny later on the loony house and for some reason unified em both in his head.Lenny the hallucination David now sees is obviously the YED. Though I have doubts that the angriest boy is also YED. Angriest is more related to Davids youth while YED is more of a young adult demon. I think YED is a personality he made out of Benny. The curly hair dude WILL die next episode or at least hes not the big bad. Maybe the old bad dude will call somebody else. More powerful.,LegionFX,degiwow,2,t5_3e713
