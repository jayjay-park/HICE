1040177,0,t1_chmb1qf,Agreed. Im kinda hoping for the day when we can just subscribe to vmedia and pair it with any Internet provider. That said we arent the content creators or the content providers. They can put whatever restrictions they want on their content. Its our job as consumers to complaint to the right people about it and if things dont change the way we want to find content provided in the ways we want. For me its OTA and Netflix until things change and Im okay with that. Although things are improving its pretty much the same deal with cable at this point. ,canadacordcutters,chmitl4,1,t5_2xbk5

6927296,0,t1_d11h5rl,But that is my point Im well aware that CTV Global City amp CBC have websites tablet and smart phone apps.  They have for awhile but none of them have produced apps for Apple TV Roku SmartTVs etc.  My point simply is that OTT boxes in Canada are rendered utterly useless because the media companies in Canada refuse to develop for that market and the main reason is because the majority of them are owned by cable companies.  Set up a device as the American version and you will see what choice is supposed to be about. There are apps for NBC CBS Fox ABC plus speciality channels like History AampE FX HBO Showtime HGTV Food ESPN CNN NBC News CBS News ABC NewsSome of them require cable subscriptions to use others are a mix of free content and yet here in Canada we are still waiting for one.,canadacordcutters,d11j8q0,1,t5_2xbk5

8327371,0,t1_d5ied7n,Yeah have a look at cipherTV. In your case. They seem to have their shit together with regards to how you can order I.e. pick a basic package and cherry pick individual channels a la carte. I tried cipher they had a brief open beta and anyone could join even outside BC. The cipher UI is clunky but the TV quality was great.

9808434,0,t1_dam360q,Thats true they may increase the price. I am doubtful that they will do so until next year though since they will want to gain subscribers and for sure those with a current membership would be grandfathered until the next renewal since we are charged annually. The US sub also includes a ton of other bonuses on top of the videos and free shipping. No way in hell they will just come back and charge an additional fee to the current subscribers.Even still  is well worth it for the videos alone if their selection is at least as good as Shomi or better.,canadacordcutters,dam3ljh,3,t5_2xbk5
9826113,0,t1_daocf59,That already happened. Shomi was a partnership between Rogers and Shaw and it lasted two years.

11329207,0,t3_5ytug2,Late response but the WBC was limited on MLB app to the US. They used some pretty funky geo protection as DNS and VPNs didnt work. Its likely they used billing records. On the Jays r someone posted a note that the Jays would now be blacked out as per someone at the team. Since then a MLB rep said this is not true. No one knows what is going to happen but several people have demanded refunds given the history of not blacking out before. Im waiting and seeing.
