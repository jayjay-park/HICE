7022890,0,t3_4bo7bp,Im hoping it will actually be beneficial to me that I dont watch the show and I only seek out the clips Im interested in. Because maybe since I didnt watch the clusterfuck that is the past two seasons of Jaime the whole thing will feel more genuine. IDK. Im really pessimistic about the start of the season theyre really pushing JC and Im not feeling it AT ALL. I know its probably meant to be a fake out but unless they break up within the first few episodes theyre really hurting the chance for JB to feel real like its meant to be.,jaimebrienne,d1ce9qc,1,t5_39zuv
7069680,0,t3_4cfc0u,How I started? Well I suppose the fun thing was that I more or less by accident watched The Bear and the Maiden Fair. That was the first episode Ive watched completely. I already knew at that point what the general overall plot was about and I knew that Jaime was the asshole whos pushed Bran out the window etc. But after watching the leap into the bearpit I was like yeah those two definitely love each other and I had the luck that I instantly had an uplifting quality in Jaime that I could inscribe on my evaluation of his character. So going from there I then bingewatched starting at the beginning and instantly started internet research on the two plus the fanfics. Only once I joined the JB forum did I start reading the books though  and even then I only read the JB chapters to begin with so yeah same procedure upon reflection. And once I read it I was like Yep you were totes right in shipping the hell out of those two. Why I ship it  I like the transgression from hate to mutual respect and their sheer will to die for each other despite the fact that neither one made an overt love declaration to the other just yet.  I am trash for the Beauty and the Beast trope I like it that they are written as characters who can fully function without the other one there they are still independent fleshed out characters who can operate on their own have their own plus shared goals and way of thinking its no one part of a whole bullcrap that gives me toothaches I love it how they are in mental denial of it after all  as though literally choosing to die for each other constantly defending each other dreaming of each other naked or marrying I now want either one to have a dream about them marrying naked... were no hint at all I like that they dont fit conventions sure they fulfill some but there is always something special about it in my view I like it how Brienne serves as an inspiration for Jaime to change something about himself  instead of being the one to actively change him I like that they built a solid foundation prior to overtly romanticeroticsexualetc. actions their relationship stands on the strong pillar of mutual respect and care Its no perfected kind of love Especially in the books I love it that Jaime still recognizes Brienne as ugly because that is what she is but can find some aspects about her which are beautiful and perceive them as such Their love is true  its not distorted by mutual illusions its at any stage real and based on the knowledge that either one is flawed... I could go on for hours... ,jaimebrienne,d1hplwr,3,t5_39zuv
7096926,0,t1_d1krfil,If theyre not doing LSH maybe Brienne swears herself to the Tullys and the Blackfish demands she prove herself by killing Jaime?What Im wondering is if Brienne will even come in contact with the outlaws and McShanes character. Isnt McShane only supposed to be in one episode? A lot of people are thinking hell be a part of the Hounds storyline and bring him back from the dead. Not sure how that leaves much time to have a storyline with Brienne as well.,jaimebrienne,d1kt1y9,1,t5_39zuv
7124561,0,t3_4cfh1k,JaimeQyburn and JaimeBrienne in the bath might be the scenes that had the best adaptation from book to screen. GOT occasionaly does things very well which is why its sooo frustrating that they screw up so much.,jaimebrienne,d1nzaxj,1,t5_39zuv
7352377,0,t1_d2d54kv,I cant wait to see how they frame it. That would be so typical. And yeah I wonder if the HS just told him about Lancel?,jaimebrienne,d2dwybx,1,t5_39zuv
7536635,0,t3_4ihy12,Can someone help me i am a bit confused did Jaime get the Unsullied treatment or...??I am so disgusted by his character right now.  Going along with EVERYTHING Cersei wants?  Are DampD reading the same books?  Or did they just Spark note them?  Scratch that had they SparkNoted the damn things they still would have realised how done Jaimes character was with all of Cerseis plots.Like this all feels like they are playing to the actress rather than being true to Cerseis character.  Lena is a GREAT actress but why are they pumping her up so much?  At this point in the books she is tossing wine in Jaimes face and calling him a useless Eunoch...aha that is what DampD are reading?  Maybe they stopped there.And was I the only one second hand embarassed that they had Jaime in that scene in the small council?  That had to be the worst degradation of character i have seen so far...well that and Loras.  I am still pissed about Loras i should not have even brought it up...Fuck the whole KL shit sucked Donkey Balls,jaimebrienne,d2yvn6q,3,t5_39zuv
7623024,0,t1_d388wxb,I agree that they might but its too late for me to really care tbh. As you said you cannot erase all the terrible characterization weve had to endure for the past seasons.,jaimebrienne,d38p46j,1,t5_39zuv
7627440,0,t1_d39711z,Thanks man and Im really excited about that. Its gonna be nice battle D,jaimebrienne,d3976aa,1,t5_39zuv
7682399,0,t1_d3f6yd9,agreed. in the books you never wonder whether brienne is a sexual being or not her interactions with jaime are quite sexually charged in places. not to mention they think of each other naked. yet another instance of the show mistaking characterisation.,jaimebrienne,d3ffx2s,1,t5_39zuv
7708572,0,t1_d3ide55,I honestly cant remember if this spoiler was ever reliably sourced. I think Ill check in with my spoiler expert to see. Ive long suspected JonDany would happen in the books. I hate it. I loathe it.,jaimebrienne,d3ievr5,1,t5_39zuv
7782199,0,t1_d3qrorm,Ha! Still trying to keep the suspense in RLJ right until the end. Its probably gonna kill him when the show beats him to it.,jaimebrienne,d3qrry4,1,t5_39zuv
7791171,0,t3_4m1m5i,what i would want is nothing like its gonna go down anyway given the spoilers i wanted the book reunion. and before i sound like a fussy book purist i only mean the core of their reunion being the same i dont really care about lsh or circumstances i wanted jaime to scramble to his feet and follow her without a second question simply because she says she wants his help.knowing the show is doing the opposite the best case scenario for me would be their argument to be preceded by a cute moment of two people unexpectedly finding each other again. and the argument to be a proper row with fuck offs thrown in it or the equivalent of a fuck off. if its tepid and insipid isnt gonna cut it.ETA oh and i want bri to go super dramatic with a i trusted you and i believed in you youre breaking my heart and your word is worth nothing at all. they were right about you seriously if she doesnt go super dramatic on his arse its just not gonna work for me.,jaimebrienne,d3rs9ao,3,t5_39zuv
7845835,0,t1_d3xx8cs,Yeah in hindsight ... I almost wish theyd just stuck with JaimeCersei all the way like they apparently wanted to and never tried to bring the other story on board at all. I would have stopped torturing myself with watching my favorite characters get butchered.,jaimebrienne,d3xxvkh,3,t5_39zuv
7845862,0,t1_d3xwdhi,tbh until this season i saw their relationship as dragging yes but mostly over. i didnt expect them to get them back together in full force.,jaimebrienne,d3xxzhl,1,t5_39zuv
7851179,0,t1_d3yg3mk,gtyeah... I defended the whole point of Dorne by saying it was the key to split JC but lol wow....I mean that was totally a logical thing to think. Jokes on us I guess. gtbtw wtf happened to Dorne? It was even introduced again this season but then they just ditched it including all of the consequences for murdering Myrcella.Its ludicrous. Cant say Im unhappy not to see any more of the Sand Fakes but that is a pretty weird omission considering a coup just went down there along with a murder of the Kings sister. Its incredibly sloppy writing to just leave that hanging and not show any follow up whatsoever. gt I love how they had Jaime say a line about how its bad to not follow through with your own threats and then they dont follow through with the threats in their own storylines.That irony had not even occurred to me but youre absolutely right. facepalm,jaimebrienne,d3yjjhf,1,t5_39zuv
7886180,0,t1_d42g5no,Yeah they have him dressing like Tywin. Its a good look although I wish they could give him correspondingly good dialogue. No amount of leather will make Ill kill all the Tullys to get back to Cersei palatable. ,jaimebrienne,d42h9tn,5,t5_39zuv
7930159,0,t1_d47ds05,theres no valonqar prophecy in the show but i dont think that means theres no valonqar in the show. if grrm has it planned i cant see the show passing on it because its a shocking moment a la stannisshireen.,jaimebrienne,d47fao3,3,t5_39zuv

7951432,0,t1_d49i62k,Tyrion too. Its like he hasnt killed anyone let alone his dad and the supposed love of his life. Jon well hes more the brooding and silent type so I guess they didnt know how to show it...gtAnd when they do we get Yaras PTSD pep talks.Which makes you kind of glad that they dont focus on consequences ,jaimebrienne,d49teh6,1,t5_39zuv
8001308,0,t3_4otnpj,Agreed.  I want that trailer grabby hands,jaimebrienne,d4ff8jh,1,t5_39zuv
8005920,0,t1_d4fwlbz,I think Jaime is more Thor than Loki. I view Tyrion as closer to Loki  intellectually oriented dads least favorite son feel like their achievements are never recognized crave love crave power think chivalrous acts such as getting on a raft in your armor during battle are stupid but have fits of gallantry anyway. . . You know that makes me wonder why theres all this Thorki trash but no JaimeTyrion slash.,jaimebrienne,d4fxw1k,2,t5_39zuv

8090411,0,t1_d4pe6uy,They set up the JC breakup and they set up the romance between JB in episode . Something tells me jaime wont be in KL long next season.,jaimebrienne,d4pfphx,7,t5_39zuv
8103615,0,t1_d4qg6n5,Yes I was surprised when Dany accepted his random explanation too. But then theres the fact that Dany really abandoned them when she flew away with Drogon and Im not sure if Tyrion could have done anything to prevent the attack... The Meereen track was really weird this season.gtThe way that they keep sacrificing one characters arc in service of another is getting a bit frustrating.I agree.,jaimebrienne,d4qx3vc,2,t5_39zuv

9410954,0,t3_5957cz,I still dont believe every single foiler the guy posted but the outline seems to be pretty damn accurate so far. Im surprised we didnt get no valonqar bullshit too since it wouldve fit right in with this crazy ass season  story line. ,jaimebrienne,d98wkm3,2,t5_39zuv
9600102,0,t1_d9wdbbi,Its too bad Cersei doesnt know Legilimency. Then she could read Jaimes mind and see Its yours. Its always been yours and know shes already lost. ,jaimebrienne,d9weq6g,3,t5_39zuv
9626728,0,t1_d9ykoq5,gt  She agrees to go because she knows Jaime will be there so she believes she will be safe  she believes him to be an honorable man.oh yeah i totally forgot the reddit prophet said that. good one. i hope it plays out in a way everyones like wtf jaime lannister and honour what your crush is showing bri.,jaimebrienne,d9zoxnp,3,t5_39zuv
9799475,0,t1_dakwlsj,gt  Like they have spent soooo much time since the beginning of the show hammering in how much Cersei loves her kids how she lost one of Roberts how its her only redeeming feature how Myrcella made her feel like she could be good blah blah blah.But this is exactly why I think theyre going to destroy that idea. Certainly they can keep going the route they are with her. Im not confident anymore when it comes to their intentions regarding Cersei but it just goes with their previous patterns of being super repetitive with a theme or whatever and then going LOL bye. They just dragged it out longer than necessary with Cersei and thats my issue. They could have slowly started the deconstruction process two seasons ago instead of having some abrupt change like this is the fuckin show Once Upon A Time where the people go good to bad and badgood in literally  seconds over one stupid thing. ,jaimebrienne,dakzw8s,2,t5_39zuv
10904775,0,t1_de4oloo,the person who wrote the post is also a guy and also ships BT so that seems to be a patterngt Thats a really cool theory although it does poke a hole in my dreams of Brienne and Tormund settling down in a little holdfast and raising a brood of unstoppable warriors.As opposed to Jaime and Brienne who would raise a brood of neckbeard manchildren? What even?,jaimebrienne,de4r0as,4,t5_39zuv
11033657,0,t1_deieyeb,Aw thanks! xD Dude I wish I could write hahah. I always get ideas that spontaneously attack me and then hold me hostage for weeks but whenever I attempt to write it looks like a  year old did it  I feel like theyre going to use her hopefully in season  but for sure in season . I can just SENSE it. Theyve been amping her up in the fighting department romance department and theyve been putting a heavy emphasis on that sword. Her part would have been very easy to cut or merge if Brienne as Brienne wasnt important. Im eager to see how she plays in the overall plot. ,jaimebrienne,dein1rz,2,t5_39zuv

The whole point is that HE SHOULDNT EVEN BE THERE BY NOW TO WITNESS THIS SHIT ANYWAY?? He should have already seen enough of her crap to bounce the fuck out by now if he truly had a character awakening post handchop??? Jaime has left KL and returned three times now. That is very excessive. You cannot tell me that they couldnt have adapted a storyline away from KL while continually developing his character.,jaimebrienne,dgkjjys,2,t5_39zuv
