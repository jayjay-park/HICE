For example if I disappoint a client or disappoint my motherinlaw or whoever how do I give less fuck about it?

1049098,0,t3_261kb0,My parents are frequently pushing me to stop being lonely and get a housemate.I dont know everyone is different but for me it would absolutely not work. Id almost I said almost! rather be sleeping on a park bench out in the streets than to have a roommate.My problem with it is mostly out of a matter of principal.For me living with someone else needs some strong basis for justification.The suggestions to get a roommate so you are not lonely seems horribly backwards to me.Its kinda like saying Why dont you get that girl pregnant so you can marry her and have a wife? WTF?It works in one way you cant just reverse it.If you have someone to live with great you get to be less lonely.But if you want to be less lonely you cant really just fix it by forcefully finding someone to live with.Since you have asked in your question I further expand that I have been living on my own for a few years and from a young age and whilst it has not been exactly awesome it has been far better than anything I can imagine with someone else. I have the freedom to choose with whom when and for how long I want to spend time with.If you do go down that path I strongly strongly advise that you make an effort and set some sort of minimum required monthly social activity for yourself so you dont just end up isolating yourself.Yeah  job doesnt leave all that much time left anyway ... by the time you get home and wind down its already  cook some dinner its  gotta do some chores or random things here and there and wrap it up and go to bed in an hour or two.Its just weekends when people would go out and stuff and having someone living with your or not is not all that relevant.In summary I speak for myself as an introvert that I do not do things for the reasons I deem backwards reverse or wrong.Some examples of the reverse thing I keep talking about I dont marry someone because I want to have a wife. I will have a wife because I found someone I want to marry. I wont force myself to get along with people to make friends. I make friends with someone because I get along with them. I wont live with someone because I want to save on costs and rent. I save on costs and rent because I happened to find someone to live with. I wont study some topic to earn a degree. I earn a degree because I found a topic I want to study enough to get a degree in.Obviously the world is not perfect and sometimes you have to compromise slightly on these things but Im sure you get the idea.

1159028,0,t1_chzwpnq,edited for brevitys sakeThanks a lot for your long response! Its good insight into uni life as a whole. I was really hesitant to join an orientation but now I might reconsider it. I would like to share with you my issues regarding your points idk why it turned out ranty and long introvert issues but I dont expect you to respond to all of them. Already very happy that you can lend a listening ear.Most importantly since you are an OGL am I allowed to decline from activities if I really dislike them? Will people judge me from doing so? Things that are ok to people might be really bad for me. And are there cases of people leaving the orientation early? Its a really draconian measure but if I was alienated and had the choice to leave halfway into the camp with some excuse I will feel a lot more confident to commit to one without worries.Back to my worries the main issue is the type of activities that they organize I think I am ready enough to have small talk with people but some of the activities are way off my tolerance conversely I will definitely do my best to participate in uni actvitiesccas as a whole but I have always disliked team bonding games and even sports since I am bad at them and my extrovert battery drains out very fast. I think my introvert self will completely take over by Day    if I have to put up this front for almost  thereby backfiring my socializing attempts or even not being able to change mere acquaintances into friends. I am good at listening to people talk about their lives but Im particularly bad at sharing interesting stories or having a common interest with someone else. I dont play sports or watch soccer I dont have a illustrious army life to share or had an particularly interesting school life. My interests are so nich that I instantly click onto people when I find them but what are the odds? I will get stuck in convos after a while while people can chatter non stop as their interests align. And I dont feel like the activities can bond me any more than sitting beside them silently tbh its a lot of team games and relatively little conversations. It works to some extent but only if you already feel comfortable and are a friend to them.Initially everyone might seem interested in each other but after a while cliquesgroups form quickly and its pretty scary to be left alone in an OG talking to everyone but people giving you a cold shoulder or seemingly uninterested in you. Unless you tell me that everyone is really open and friendly to people from all walks of life. The most painful part is knowing you are not linked to anyone and you still have to act like you are just being carried along by waves of activities. The  days of hazing and extrovertstyled activities doing it all alone without a break. Meeting your OG in the future after everything and pretending you are close to them when you are not.Other than that I definitely understand all the benefits of socializing and orientations which you described. To me its like a costbenefit analysis.  You are describing to me all the benefits while I am thinking a lot about the costsissues.,introvert,ci00bel,1,t5_2qlr2

1345347,0,t3_29hh7y,You could start by trying to have a more positive attitude.  Thats not meant to be an insult I am being completely serious.  One of the realities of adult life is that in most jobs you need to work with other people so you might as well try to get along with them.  Its easy to sit back and listen to them and find fault their sense of humor is by far the worst Ive ever encountered but all youre doing is making yourself miserable.  Youre probably thinking No they are making me miserable but they arent making you feel anything.  They are just being themselves and you are choosing to respond the way you are.  Nobody is bullying you or insulting you or doing anything bad to you you are the one who is deciding to be upset.So ask yourself where thats getting you.  You arent hurting them and you arent changing them.  Ive been bitter at work Ive rolled my eyes listening to their bad jokes or fumed at their shallow pointless discussions about celebrity news but it never changed anything and your anger wont change anything either.  Even though you dont like it they arent doing anything wrong so even if they do happen to notice your displeasure theyll just think theres something wrong with you not them. Since they arent going to change then you need to change.  It might not be easy but so what?  You can do things that arent easy if its important to you.   The question is what change to make and that is something youll have to figure out for yourself.  Instead of finding differences between yourself and them try to find what you have in common.  Or try to find some humor in what they say even if you have to fund amusement in how bad their sense of humor is.  Maybe bury yourself in your work and keep yourself busy.  Try to relax a bit more and understand that no matter how impossible it may seem now you can learn how to coexist with them. As a last resort you can also change jobs if things are that bad.  Youll probably find that even looking for another job will cheer you up since you will begin to see a light at the end of the tunnel and youll enter the mindset that the misery is coming to an end.  However if you plan to stay in this social care industry you might run into the same problems wherever you go.  Better to learn to deal with it.  ,introvert,cikyu7v,1,t5_2qlr2

And for a long time I have known who I am and have stopped giving a fuck about what people thought of since I was a little kid and Im only . I know more about life than people who are in their s. Im not saying Im a know it all I mean I understand more about life and people than a lot of people my age and older. Until you can get over the fact that people might be judging you and trust me I care that people judge me but I dont let it effect me. Its something you cant control. Let people come up to you and talk to you sometimes yea its annoying your just trying to do things by yourself but sometimes those people are just trying to make you feel better without knowing your perfectly fine you just have to learn that they dont know you and it was probably just as hard for them to come over and talk to you then it would be for you to talk to them. Unless the people who are coming to you are being mean about you being by yourself then dont take any offense to it but instead accept it and think hey  I came by myself but it wont kill me to talk to someone and maybe find something interesting about them. For me Im pretty introverted but am really interested in people and if your talking to me Im not going to brush you off but instead of trying to come up with stuff to talk about myself I ask questions about themselves. People love talking about themselves because we know ourselves the best and we want the world to know what were like and what we like and do and I use this as an advantage and let people talk and talk. Its only uncomfortable if you let it be uncomfortable. Theres a phrase that I like to use when working out and its  you have to be comfortable being uncomfortable. it means in order to do things that you want your going to have to be ok being uncomfortable and eventually you will get used to it and it wont be so bad anymore.,introvert,cj274yz,2,t5_2qlr2

I guess I always knew what he was thinking and could understand him so it was nice. We could sit in a room together and not talk for hours and still communicate and understand each other. He is grown and in the Navy now and has been having difficulty being with people  but found it quite easy to deal with the long periods of silence. I found it amusing he couldnt understand why some guys got in so much trouble because they just couldnt stfu! Sorry for rambling on.,introvert,co3mxcj,2,t5_2qlr2

Completely out of season no tourists everything was cheap and quiet. The hotel almost paid me for staying with them. Was it weird being alone in a foreign city on your birthday? Not really. As I said I dont care for those dates and my friends know. First texts and calls arrived around midday just when I was trying to get outta bed. Then I just wandered around the city for a couple of hours and finally settled on a nice nonfancy cozy restaurant and that was it.

3670109,0,t1_cqalw93,Yeah the gay culture is very sexually charged and its weird sometimes because Im not. Since I came out as gay also even the ones who knew I was asexual seem to expect me to be more sexual and into men like they are. So that doesnt help either. So I dont have a large amount of experience with being trans in the gay community as I just starting coming out a few months ago. I go to a gay bar every weekend though. Its mainly men and its a small bar. a blue collar gay bar. Everyone I have had a reaction from has been good. Everyones been pretty supportive. Theres things they say that are uncomfortable or not exactly right but they try and they mean well. Im sure the fact that most people I interact with I interact with them with friends around. I also still look more like I guess a lesbian woman and I still tend not to correct strangers or acquaintances concerning pronouns. Not to be potentially inflammatory but to me honest I feel like Im more accepted there then lesbians. At least some people definitely started treating me more warmly when they found out I wasnt a lesbian and then even more warmly when they found out I was trans.

3692584,0,t3_32orta,What was his GPA? I got a  on my ACT as well but I only had a . GPA in high school. My dream school at the time the University of Minnesota  Twin Cities rejected my application. UW Madison would have rejected my GPA as well if I had applied. Its not a free ticket to anywhere unless his work ethic shows up in his GPA.I ended up going to community college yes with a  ACT for two years now I go to a pretty average university in Wisconsin. I saved a TON of money my first two years though part of me wishes Id had the dorm life experience. As a transfer student its tough to make friends later on though thats not the worst thing for an introvert. Some introverts prefer not to socialize at all which is fine. I made new friends where I work and a couple in my classes but I am not the type of person to go out and party on the weekends. I havent smoked or had anything to drink all throughout college thus far. I much prefer a weekend alone with my homework and Netflix than with drunk people and puking.Anyway Im getting off track. If I were in your shoes I would tell him that I support any decision he makes. Make it clear that theres no pressure. There are some undeniable benefits of living at home but there are also perks to moving out. Also even as a transfer student I had to send my high schoolcollege transcripts and my ACT score optional but certainly helped me when I was applying for the transfer. So if he goes to a junior college right away that doesnt rule out a great college later if he keeps his grades up for the first two years.Good luck let me know if you have any more questions about my experience.

The good news is that no matter what your family says they do not own you. I repeat they do NOT own you. Nobody can own you. I know that working  going to school and an insane commute are taking their toll but the truth is its your best chance at a way out. Save up to rent a tiny room out of somebodys house if you have to but once you get out of there and on your own you will feel so much better renting someones tiny dark room isnt ideal but the peace and quiet will lift a huge weight off your chest. Do everything in your power to find a job that doesnt have anything to to with them and start your own life. You are allowed to do whatever you want in life regardless of what anybody says.

Like I want to go close myself in a dark quiet room until the feeling passes.I love my alone life but I love her too.  And shes made it clear that if we are together she expects me to participate in doing things together  no more alone vacations no more alone weekends.  It also probably means things like kids which Im not that keen on.  Shes very active talks about having dinner parties x per week having family members come visit for long periods and she means  weeks at a time always going out always doing stuff.  Ive explained to her about introversion about needing time to recharge after social activities and she really doesnt buy it  shes of the opinion that Im this way because Ive always lived alone and dont know any better.Ive avoided as much of it as I could for the last  years  Ive shunted her off to her friends Ive thrown myself into work so I can stay at the office at night Ive encouraged her to take trips and visit her family without me.  Weve nearly split a couple of times over this.  But it kind of feels like its now or never this time.  After  years its either going to happen or it isnt.And I do feel like if I push her away now then  years down the road I could well be looking around wishing I had someone to share my life with and feeling like I let a good thing slip through my fingers.

I was reading about the team and clicked on a link it was the blog of the parents of the team members.  Many of them travel to see their sons games.  I was pretty much shocked to see that nearly every post on the blog was about what they drank before the game what restaurant they went to in order to drink who put together the best tailgate with the most exquisite food and alcohol who did what when they were drunk where they went to drink after the game... and they thought this was great friendship.

5624892,0,t3_3s4s19,I have traveled in that area solo multiple times and have always enjoyed it. Staying in hostels seems like the surefire way to meet people. That said i didnt stay in hostels and was still able to meet plenty of people and was pretty easily able to split my time between solo and with others as i saw fit.The thing i like about traveling alone is i can do what i want. Im not big into a lot of touristy things Im much happier exploring a new place on my own rather than with a walking tour or sitting in some park for an afternoon rather than site seeing with  other people. That said i think there are benefits to traveling with others  sometimes you need that person to push you to do or see something you otherwise wouldnt have and you push them as well. I think meeting other travelers can help balance this. For example I had originally planned to only do a day in Sweden but happened to meet a couple of people on the train and ended up doing a  day loop with them and saw a bunch of stuff i would have otherwise missed. Have you traveled alone anywhere before? I think if youve never been to Europe and youve never traveled alone even domestically it could be pretty intimidating. In that case id probably err more on the planning side of things where to go when where youre staying what youre doing etc. You get more comfortable with it over time but i think a lot of people get hung up on little things even if they didnt expect they would like eating alone taking the train alone etc and it can really end up sinking the whole trip. These days ill show up to a new country with nothing but  a return flight home and maybe a hotel reservation and just wing it but the first time i traveled internationally i really tried to plan things out because i had no experience traveling alone. ,introvert,cwubkrl,3,t5_2qlr2

It has triggered some serious anxiety in me and now Im a shut in except for a select few friends. When this started happening I freaked out I thought there was something wrong with me. I talked to my longtime friend who is the most introverted person I know and he gave me hope. He told me that he simply weighs the pros and cons of going out and doing things. If hell fell uncomfortable doing something he stays in. He doesnt think much on it. It could be considered aversion sure. But the point is that you should do what feels right to you and not think too much on it thats what socialites do.

5926603,0,t3_3wgz8w,Skype might be an easy solution.For a longer storyAnd I dont want to be negative. But Ive recently come.to the realization that I am significantly more introverted than my husband who Id label an omnivert a little of both.He is great and were compatible like using a ereader charger to.charge your phone. But I realized recently how hurt I felt after years and years of hanging out with his friends twice a weekend every weekend and more on holidays. So I had to cut everyone out of my life right now I have my husband and a few intermittent work friends that I see outside of work once every few months. I dont have sex anymore because I felt invaded there too and I might be asexual Its been close to a year.So what did I tell my husband? I told him that if sex was really important to him that he could find someone else. He got petulant and mean for a few months. Tried to threaten me with divorce. To which I agreed. It wasnt fair for him to be in a relationship with someone he was so incompatible with I know because I know how it felt for years and years of thinking there was something wrong with me for wanting more alone time. So now he has a girlfriend. And while I havent talked to her much. I can tell they love eachother more than I ever loved him. They are perfect for each other like  an LG phone and LG charger. And thats great. Really because now I dont feel guilty for not being someone else thats more extroverted and cuddly. And because I know he can get all the physical affection he wants and that I cant provide. Hes currently struggling with the change because he says he also loves me Im not pushing him because I know that he has to make his own choices. I know that he and I will both be happier if he has someone that matches his energy level and he will let me know what that looks like to him if we stay married or not.So the moral of the story. dont try to be something youre not. It will only cause more pain later when you cant keep up the fake extroversion anymore. tell the truth how they react is on them not you. As long as you let them have their emotions I told my husband a lot I understand why youre upset and Im sorry that I had to wait so long to tell you these things youre not being an ass but they might try to convince you that youre being an ass anyway. Now he agrees that Im allowed to define my boundaries and that he was being mean because he was scared and genuinely didnt believe that he could find someone else. Now he feels silly for saying that hed never find someone like me because IMO he found someone better for him than I am. to make up for my other less optimistic sounding points just because a relationship isnt perfect doesnt mean its bad. Even if we do end up getting divorced Im still glad that he was in my life for these years. Im also glad if he decides that his new girlfriend is good for him because perfect.is still worth shooting for even if youre already in a good relationship. through all of.this Ive come to realize that I really am a female spock half human half Vulcan. I look at relationships very logically and while I have feelings they dont play as big of a role in my decisions as they do for other people. So Im not sure how much this will help  Ive been known to tell emotional people logical things just to have them take everything to an emotional extreme  youd think Id know better but I dont fully understand emotional people yet. So just take what you can from this and roll your eyes at the rest.Edits to finish explaining some.concepts and clean up phone typos,introvert,cxwibuw,1,t5_2qlr2

Personally I like to think people are more complex than needing to either be around people or needing alone time. If you cant stand introverts Im sorry that is how you feel. The way I always thought about relationships though is that everyone has pros and cons specific to different people. An observation. Since you live in a college time would that mean your options are limited in meeting people? Maybe a change of pace would be in order? Your boyfriend doesnt define you right?  is young considering the increasing longevity were experiencing. Have fun while your limbs still move right. Get into some groups meet people.Youre shy I know. But you dont have crippling social anxiety or other social disorders. You can meet people.

We are scheduled to be moving to a new office location in June and there has been lots of talk of it being open concept with just a handful of private offices.  I will be going from an office with one coworker and a lake view to possibly half cubes or one table in the middle of the city surrounded by towers and condos.  Ive decided that I am willing to give it a shot and see what the new environment is like and if its terrible and I cant work in the new setup I will probably start looking for a new job.  Us lowly employees have no idea whats going on at this new space the management of course hasnt given us any details about what the new setup is going to be like.

6667801,0,t1_d08lxc7,Another fundamental difference between the two of us you actively look for friendships and desire companionship  I couldnt say the same about myself. Yes I also remember those high school times when I had the same people around me for years and of course I was and still am closer to some of them then others but I let those connections fade away  nowadays the only occasion on which I see them are class reunions which we hold approximately once every . years.If you look for likeminded people who share your interests I recommend forming closer relationships with people here on reddit. I for example am highly active in rModelUSGov a political simulation and having spent more than  months in this simulation I have met lots of different people some of which I know since my earliest days. Sure those are people behind a screen and a fake name as all of us and I could break contact with all of them instantly and wouldnt mind  so I recommend to you as well to simply look through your reddit subscriptions find out what your interests are and who knows perhaps you can form RL relationships  many of those subs from time to time host RL meetings as well.,introvert,d090b80,1,t5_2qlr2
6689998,0,t3_478nep,There seems to be a small confusion in your post. A psychologist has a degree in psychology and their therapy session will focus more on words and actions. They wont be able to make a diagnosis per se because thats the side of a psychiatrist. A psychiatrist has a medical MD degree can diagnose can prescribe pills and the like. Which one you go to will end up being your choice.FWIW I recently got done with a psychologist run that will probably turn into a psychiatrist one once I move back to my home state. It was a phenomenal change for me. I finally started feeling whole and was able to deal with a lot of problems I was having in life which included having my mother have a stroke my father dying and my girlfriend ending our relationship all in a . month timeframe. There are some things that he my therapist would not be able to deal with such as my continued issues with depression and horrible anxiety attacks. With that as a frame Id seek a psychologist first and if the issues you feel you have are not able to be resolved with them then shift over tot he MD side. I just personally dont like pill pushing so YMMV.,introvert,d0baz0k,7,t5_2qlr2

You can get paid to write website content writeedit other peoples ebooks email newsletters anything you can imagine.

6982360,0,t3_4bba8x,I think it sets a good example to get out of the house and socialize a couple times a month with acquaintances.  It teaches your kids about obligations and duties that even though they may not want to go somewhere in the end it usually turns out alright and they will probably have a good time.  You also want your kids to get in the habit of knowing how to introduce themselves to strangers make small talk and answer questions politely outside of the school environment.  Being exposed to more people as a child is likely to reduce social anxiety.  I have always been an introvert but my parents forced me into going to church and family get togethers and other kids parties and it helped me not be scared of being around other people.  I was considered shy because I didnt talk much I didnt want to but when I decided to come out of my shell in middle school there were no big fears about other kids or adults.You dont mention if your kids are introverted but whether they are or not its nice to lead by example and show that dad can make friends too.  If you really only get to spend time with your kids on the weekend dont feel as though you need to go out alone to a bar or game night with other guys to socialize.  Do something you can do with your kids!  Look into helping out with Boy Scouts do some family activities at the local zoo or botanical garden or park and ask other fathers if theres any family or kids groups that meet every month in the area.  If you like any of your coworkers invite himher and their spouse over to your place for dinner and tell them theyre welcome to bring their kids.Like you I made most of my friends when I was younger and weve since gone on to live in all different parts of the country.  I moved a couple years ago and made no effort whatsoever to make new friends.  However I am pregnant and know I will be stepping outside of my comfort zone to set a good example.  I plan on going back to church not recommending that for anyone else unless theyre already religious possibly joining a womens club and would like to be involved with Girl Scouts if I have a daughter.  Its exhausting to think about having very little free time but I know Ill be happy when Im doing these things and it will make my kids happy to have a mom that isnt always hanging around the house.  Dont worry about your funeral just teach your children about the positives of being open to making friends.,introvert,d17sfow,1,t5_2qlr2

7590045,0,t1_d33ysco,gt I dont understand what peoples problem is with FacebookFor me it has addictive aspects. Ive logged on to check my notifications then found myself still mindlessly scrolling through the news feed  or more minutes later often in a fired up or semi anxious state completely forgetting what I came for in the first place. Ive noticed Im more likely to fall into a scrolling loop when Im tired.A lot of the stuff I see on my news feed invokes an emotional reaction e.g. a stolenmissing animal that may not even be in the same state or country as me injustices of various types stories about sick kidsadults awful things politicians have said etc etc. These are all certainly things that I care about as a normal empathetic human being but the problem is that  of the time there is literally nothing I can do to help. Obviously knowing about the sorts of things that go in the world is important as is helping others where you can. But in general I tend to end up mildly upsetuse up emotional energy and the people in the stories gain nothing from me as an individual. Repeat this thousands or millions of times for every person that has a similar facebook experience and this aspect of facebook begins to become a colossal waste of time and energy. All that being said though it is amazingly useful for keeping in contact with acquaintances sharing information and staying up to date with events. This is why I still use it and try to only check it at times where I literally only have  minutes spare to avoid falling into a scrolling loop. ,introvert,d34y8nz,7,t5_2qlr2

7923692,0,t3_4nlvqs,I agree with a lot of the things other people have posted regarding how it is a very normal thing for introverts to be fatigued from social interaction but I hope you dont mind me also adding in a perspective considering relationship dynamics and communication.As WP related having a relationship shift into being sexually active can be considered a significant transition for some people male or female. In addition to how introverts have the tendency to lean away from impulsiveness and prefer to know further information before jumping into something this may also have some bearing in your friends behavior. In the same regard Id also recommend clear communication regarding expectations if it hasnt been made clear already and to which the following questions come to mind  Are the both of you okay with a FWB relationship?  Do you have the same expectations for what the sexual intimacy will mean? Will there be any issues with unreciprocated romantic attachment later on? And to generally repeat what willurd said I think its a just a normal thing for males to not always be in the mood for sex contrary to what modern media might depict and doesnt necessarily mean that your friend doesnt find you sexually attractive. And its good for your friendship that he answered honestly and that you dont feel any need to pressure Ultimately I think you might want to consider a conversation to clearly define what you want from him and that its fine if hes not interested or wants some time to consider it.I may be overthinking things but hey this is a sub of introverts. ,introvert,d46p52e,1,t5_2qlr2

She might like having the home to herself too.I and my husband have been married a long time.  And we spend most weekends together either at home or we go out but  When he decides to play golf for the day.  I kind of like having the places to myself for a few hours. So bare that in mind.   It may do you good to have some space sometimes.   I understand for you youre at home all day anyway with your work and so youre probably chomping at the bit to get out and your lady is the opposite  shes like yey Im home.  Bliss.  Its a slight conundrum but I think you guys can sort it out. Maybe when she sees that you are having some outdoor independent time  shell want to come With you next time because she doesnt want to miss out on something fun.   hopefully some kind of compromise can be made.  One weekend you go out together  following weekend you do your  thing.     Alternate weekends perhaps.     Or not go out out both Saturday and Sunday.   Make it short excursions  not many  hours outings.       It does seem  like you are doing more of the compromising.   I think communicate more With her on how you feel about this topic.   Good luck.Oh just wanted to add.Both me and husband are introverts but of course  we still want to go out sometimes  But were not always on the Same page  and we do that whole thing I dont want to go but Ill go if you want to go  Ya know that is based on love.

It is always sucky having to break up with someone especially when its not a mutual decision    it is uncomfortable for you to have to do  but I think you wont be as upset as you anticipate.

8054072,0,t3_4pimir,The best explanation Ive seen is in the FAQ    Introverts have high baseline levels of cognitive stimulation and arousal even at rest and thus are constantly trying to avoid any additional visual and social stimuli. So when theyre trying to concentrate nearby noises or people are additional stimuli that becomes distracting and pushes them over their optimal level of arousal. Extraverts on the other hand are at a constant arousal deficit and require extra stimuli to compensate and bring them to their optimal level. So they seek out places with lots of people loud music or interesting visuals.,introvert,d4lcqtn,6,t5_2qlr2

Its harder to judge whether someone is an introvert or extrovert based on how they act in social situations because they are going to be in social mode.Shyness and introversion are not related.At the end of a stressful day do you want to decompress with alone time or are you itching to find people to socialize with? Will you get restless if you have too much alone time or restless when you have to socialize too much? For me I can go weeks or months without socializing and theres no such thing as too much of it for me.

8808919,0,t3_50pgkk,The best thing to deal with social anxiety for me has been to just do it. It is scary at first but after a while it becomes not so scary because it doesnt do as horrible as your brain makes it think it will. You might have suffered some of that horrible especially when you were young where you put yourself out there and got stomped by the cool kids or something.But that doesnt really happen as much the older you get. Just put yourself out there and you and your people will gravitate to each other.Also I know I am awkward. I say and do awkward things. I was always a big nerddork and i caught shit for being into comics etc before Marvel made nerding cool. But now i just own it.

Anxiety is a thing that lives inside my head and doesnt pay rent and gets in the way of doing shit that I would otherwise like to do.

9847936,0,t3_5gcqa3,gt Is my mother being unfair?No. You need to look at this situation from both sides. I assume your family are not all introverts otherwise you probably wouldnt have this problem so for your cousins seeing you and the rest of your family is their goal in visiting. For your mother her goal is to show off her house and you. You not being present removes some of the reason for your cousins to visit and it might even make your mother look bad. Your mother probably also cant even imagine that someone wouldnt want to be in a house full of people they dont really know so your behaviour is pretty alien by that standard. But you shouldnt run and hide. Its only for a few hours on one day and then you can go back to whatever else you were doing. For you its merely a diversion from your preferred day. For your cousins visiting you and your mother is probably the major plan for their day. Not being there doesnt really affect you that much but it really affects them. ,introvert,dar7ivz,32,t5_2qlr2

I usually try not to take things like broad personality tests too seriously but when I learned I was an INFJ it really matched me so well and helped me understand why I behave the way I do  the INFJ subreddit is helpful too.  I find that I have kindof intense standards at times but its the way I operate and I try to protect myself as best as possible without offending anyone.  Not many people will truly understand how I operate but thats okay.  I work in a hospital full of very loud people right now and it gets very draining but I am trying to learn how to deal with it better and eventually get to a work environment that matches me better.  Consider the situation with your roommates practice for now and dont be afraid to take care of yourself!   ,introvert,dez9bt2,2,t5_2qlr2

11361459,0,t3_623pto,I have found that since my s I have had few friends other than business connections and when those connections ceased so did the friendship.Not sure if it is solely an Introvert issue or simply a cultural reality that commonality creates connection  otherwise free time is for family or at least romantic relationships.,introvert,dfjsthc,2,t5_2qlr2

11541894,0,t3_64m3cf,Im  and perfectly fine being an introvert. Its who I am and always have been. In embracing it Ive actually felt so much happier. I went through years in high school trying to fit in and go out partying in big groups etc and I hated every minute of it. Be you and be happy  ,introvert,dg49xag,2,t5_2qlr2
11608343,0,t3_65mbni,Every second of every day. Im not depressed but I often feel very isolated or cut off. I want to interact more but when I do I get exhausted very quickly and thats not a good feeling obviously so I end up avoiding interactions a lot. Its really quite annoying. Its like knowing the delicious taste of chocolate but then getting nauseous every time you take a bite. I do appreciate that I can enjoy being alone with just my own company whereas all of my friends would go crazy in the same situation. That said I do wish the wiring in my brain was different and I was born an extrovert instead. Life would be far easier I think. Society is just not geared towards introverts at least where I live urban USA and in my field business.,introvert,dgbtdju,17,t5_2qlr2

11697368,0,t3_669mgq,Honestly I dont usually eat alone especially in public I feel like people stare and feel bad for me. I enjoy eating with close friends or family in both public and private settings  public cause I get distracted from the larger group of people around us and private because when Im done eating I can go to my room and still feel like I filled my quote for my daily interactions. ,introvert,dglwyf6,3,t5_2qlr2
11738947,0,t1_dgqly5y,True. Group conversations are more difficult. Making quick comments keeps in the circle but the focus can shift from one person to the next pretty quickly. Youre young...you have plenty of time to make more friends. I wouldnt stop talking to the girl if she likes talking to you though even if its just before class. As for getting a girlfriend theres no surefire way to do that but dont try too hard or be anyone other than yourself. Girls sense these things and its a turn off. Im sure you dont want to hear this but it really does happen when youre not really looking or expecting it. You just make a connection at some random place that you werent even planning on going to.Dont be in such a hurry. Things happen in their own time. ,introvert,dgqn1c4,3,t5_2qlr2
