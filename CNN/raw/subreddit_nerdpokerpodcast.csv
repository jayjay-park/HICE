Sark mentioned that a lot of his creations were influenced by or taken straight from a lot of different sources like books and movies. The gassy tree world was taken from a book.

11751356,0,t1_dg39kxv,Literally just found this sub after the new episode came out today. I tried finding the new podcast on Podcast Addict and it doesnt exist and actually neither does the original. Seems you were right that they have split from Earwolf and are doing it all themselves now from Brians home.

I dont use iTunes for podcasts so maybe they are still there.,nerdpokerpodcast,dgs1nmh,2,t5_2vvlu
