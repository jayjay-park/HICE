5963282,0,t1_cy19ab8,Im glad to hear that! Where did you stay? On campus or off? Ive heard that sometimes there are like...specific houses where people from certain countries will live in off campus. I dont know if thats the case at Keele. Is it a big party school? Im not much of a partier just wondering. And about how long does it take to get to classes? My school is really small so when I lived on campus it only took about  or  minutes to cross the whole campus...Im guessing this one is pretty big? Did you mostly stick with other international students or did you make lots of local friends? ,KeeleUni,cy1bfc3,1,t5_2ya6y
