Volume One is a local magazine that has an event calendar that can help you find what shows are playing and where. There are two main areas with bars Downtown and Water Street which is also downtown. Oh the joys of being on two rivers. I prefer Downtown but the college kids are out of town right now so Water Street isnt as awful I typically avoid it during the school year. As for restaurants it depends on what you like to eat we have a little bit of everything and some very good restaurants. ,Eau_Claire,ctab7in,6,t5_2u8w3
