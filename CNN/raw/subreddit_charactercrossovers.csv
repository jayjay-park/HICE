187446,0,t1_cezrkuq,He went to Gotham because he had a vision of himself saying he had to kill a bat like creature. While I absolutely hate how Talia deemphasized Banes role the movie doesnt necessarily state that Bane was working below Talia they couldve certainly been accomplices. Bane in Arkham origins transforms into a mindless monster with memory problems but its still Bane. Bane in Batman forever is a plant zombie goon with next to no mental capacity yet as much as I hate to say it its still Bane. Its not cannon and the comics dont have to acknowledge them but pretending Oh thats some other character not actually Bane is childish and petty. It is Bane whether you like it or not because some people will like it and some people wont. And if you took a survey that had a picture of Tom hardys character and said is this Bane? youd find an overwhelming majority saying yes. Because while you obviously are a comic book reader who votes no there are other comic book readers who will vote yes such as me plus all the millions of people who dont read comics and still saw the movie who would also vote yet. So since youre not God of all things Batman and since some people will agree and some people will disagree the ultimate verdict is yes it is a version of bane. It doesnt have to he your favorite but if I make a version of bane whos Viatnamese and came from a wealthy family only to be kidnapped and never had the ransom paid for yet managed to escape and while homeless got addicted to a lesser version of venom finally taking money to be in an experimental trial for venom that makes him super strong it would still be Bane.When I think Joker I think Lee Bermejo and Nolans Joker not Hamills. I like that Joker better but since Hamills doesnt have facial scars I dont get to say hes fake Joker. You dont have the authority to claim real or fake.,charactercrossovers,cezsez5,0,t5_2tspy
