847335,0,t1_cgw72ja,Agreed. I moved here from Cincinnati and I didnt realize how amazing New Orleans was. People who dont live here have a really weird view of the city and I used to be one of them. No two houses look the same. No two stores are the same. In fact I finally saw a WalMart today and said WTF out loud. Finally drove down Magazine Street today... I dont think New Orleanians even understand how amazing that street and their city is. There is no other place in the US like this city maybe the world. I want to buy a house here and call this place home for the rest of my life. Im mad I never considered moving here sooner and that adverse situations pushed me thankfully here.

1044972,0,t3_261p2m,I have two problems with these rentals In my experience having lived next door to one they are usually rented by tourist coming to New Orleans to party. This means they walk home at all hours of the morning screamingfighting in the street slamming doors etc. You have no idea how many times I was woken up by airbnb renters trying to unlock my door banging on it when the key didnt work and barfing in my bushes. I had to kick numerous dudes of my front porch after they passed out in their own vomit.  Not to mention the fact that most of the guest were assholes. One guy pushed out my window when i told him to leave my porch. Of course he went to jail but this was the main reason we left the marigny to go back to bayou st john. People who live around these rentals should not have to deal with this at all hours of the night. Never knowing what kind of person is staying next to you every night.The other problem Ive seen with these rentals is landlords not renewing leases so they can rent through airbnb.  I know like  different people that this happened to. I think its causing a real housing shortage in these neighborhoods and its trickling down to effect the ever growing rental prices.   Why rent yearly when you can make so much through airbnb? I hope this airbnb trend doesnt continue to grow as fast as it has been or there wont be any long term rental stock left.,NewOrleans,chn2gi1,3,t5_2qhp5

With limited parking youll be hurting your chances of locals going out of their way to come to you.I do have doubts about the viability based on how hohum gametraders have done here despite reasonable locations. Weve got a few comic books shops that seem to be doing well a lot of people have mentioned Dibbs for LAN gaming which has been around for years and theres a tabletop gaming place called  gaming that remains in business despite being in a strip mall with their entrace facing directly away from the road. Dibbs and  are in the suburbs though.I agree with others that the Tulane area might be a good idea. Its a beautiful part of town too. Bayou Road right off of Esplanade Ave might be a good idea theres a record store thats been there for years and has done fine and its still somewhat close to Frenchman and the Quarter.edit by the way I wouldnt judge based on record stores.

1325576,0,t3_299g6h,i think this statement is interestingCampanella is most persuasive and most gleefully subversive when he contrasts Bourbon Street to the annual New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival beloved by cultural cognoscenti for its vast array of regional food offerings musical acts and exhibits devoted to local culture. You do not see beads at Jazz Fest or flashing coeds or Bourbon TShirts I Got Bourbon Faced on Shit Street. The festival as Campanella notes sees itself as a cultural refuge from all that phoniness. Yet Jazz Festwas invented by a man from Massachusetts as part of a worldwide megafestival circuitessentially a local franchise of a global chain. Meticulously choreographed and carefully policed it is managed out of New York coordinated by crack professionals presented by Shell a phrase now officially appended to the events name increasingly dependent on global superstar acts subsidized by an onsite Acura showroom and funded by Big Oilnot to mention an entrance fee that has risen  percent in ten years to fifty dollars per person now  in fact more than the median daily takehome pay for most New Orleanians. Jazz Fest is the epitome of invented planned centralized cultural control that leaves nothing to chance and covers its tracks with the trappings and aesthetics of authenticity.,NewOrleans,ciiqsyb,3,t5_2qhp5

1981187,0,t3_2hct3b,Gentrification is a natural part of many cities who are breaking out of their industrial age. This is just happening A LOT more rapidly here in New Orleans... and in an age time where its been VERY easy to track. After the storm prices crashed here... and crashed hard. You could pick up a place for  bucks from a family that was just getting the hell out of dodge. They either took what ever insurance money they could get or could not get and left. No one expected really anything to become of New Orleans after the storm. In fact a huge debate all around the world was should we let the city go back to the swamp... should we even rebuild it. Well as this debate was going on a lot of people were still sucking up those lots for k all around the city... and starting to rebuild themselves. Laws were lax and bar restaurant business permits were given without second thought There are now only  or  bar ONLY licenses give out each year.. food and alcohol are a little easier to get anything to get money back into the hands of the city and the people who live here. All of the sudden the Federal Govt decided that New Orleans was indeed worth saving. LOTS of money starts pouring into the state. Incentives to different industries The film industry for one were being handed out left and right to bring hi paid people into the city. All of the sudden those people who bought a house for  or k were sitting on a house worth...  or k... and all they did was sit back and watch it rot. That house that was purchased for k need another to k work done on it... and the value continued to raise... more and more people poured into the city and the housing demand in safe areas of town rose. The safe areas had to be expanded and gentrification starts. Block by block the property values rose. Soon the house you put  to k in was suddenly worth k... then randomly next year someone wants to give you k for it. So someone buys your house for k... this person then wants a return on their investment buying a home youre even if youre living in it and not renting it... is an investment so they start improving the neighborhood in a way that they think will make them more than k when they go to sell it. Which brings up the Bywater housing bubble What this scenario has left out is the person who never moved away and kept their house or just kept renting from the same land lord who never raised the rent the second more important than the st The poor fellow who has lived in the same house never owning it for  or  years land lord decides its time to sell. Well if that house is sold for k the new land lord sure as hell is not going to let the guy whos been in it for  years keep paying  bucks. Its out the fucking door with him. And thus starts the negative part of the cycle.TLDR Gentrification is part of any cities growth.. its a bitch in New Orleans because its happening at an accelerated speed... and there is not much being done to curve it. High rises etc ,NewOrleans,ckrxmor,6,t5_2qhp5

3288301,0,t3_2xsin1,These events are typically well attended by friends of mine and they will all be wearing dressy casual or possibly some form of garden attire if the weather is appropriate. Dont feel the need to go black tie but remember that this is an event where the whos who of the industry do a lot of business. Above all you dont want your dress or actions to reflect poorly on the person that extended you the invitation.Im sure somebody closer to the company has already taken care of purchasing the typical ceremonial gifts and outside of that gifts are not required. That being said a nice bottle of scotch always goes over well at these events. Nobody is going to expect you to get the Glenfiddich  year old for this event a cheap bottle of Glenlivet  will go over just fine. Towards the end of the evening things might get quite rowdy this is when the true business deals are made. If you are in the industry it is worth sticking around till the end of the night. Also as a side note this is NOT the type of event where it is appropriate to bring your mistress. All of the other men there will be bringing their wives and it can cause quite a commotion when the wives get together and start gossiping. ,NewOrleans,cp33cgn,14,t5_2qhp5

3663098,0,t3_329mbi,French Quarter Fest is when the artists make the majority of their income and a lot of them depend on it the issue is City Hall issues  licenses for about  spots these spots are first come first serve which leads to most of the artists camping out during this week to ensure they have a spot most of them started camping out on Sunday before FQF. The ordinance does state that operating hours for the fence are from am to PM and this rule is NEVER enforced except during French Quarter Fest.In fact all the business in the Jackson Square area can be open until any time but now the artisits who hold a business licence are being kicked off the fence at pm before the sun even goes down and missing sales because of this. Now why is this an issue for only  days of the year? It started with some of the more lazy artists that arent willing to put the time and work in the ones that only show up for festivals and maybe work  times a year. They expect to show up at am every day and walk up to the fence and have their spot and when they didnt get their way they threw a temper tantrum called the French Market Corp amp City Hall and basically annoyed the shit out of them until they had to do something about it. Now lets imagine all the artists abided the ordinance and showed up at am...you have  people fighting for  spots and that is not going to end well. Let me add to that by stating that there are only  loading zones which are restricted and you need to obtain a pass from NOPD to be able to enter the quarter during the festival. ,NewOrleans,cq9tgo5,4,t5_2qhp5

Be careful though most high rise apartments I know of within the city limits are mixed income and take Section . While thats not a bad thing in and of itself it generally means there will be crime in the area and likely in the complex itself.  Youre better off looking for a large house that has been divided into apartments. There will be plenty of options trust me. When are you moving? If you can wait until MayJune a ton of apartments will open up in the university area Uptown. Craigslist is where you need to look  Ive used Padmapper in the past draws from CL listings with a lot of success.

3835576,0,t3_34aj02,I had a friend come in town from California right after or maybe during the Ferguson unrest.  He asked if I thought we would see some of that here.  I immediately said nah not here as a matter of fact but really had to think about why.  I came up with a few reasons dealing with deep southern roots and history and early black business owners... textbook junior high Louisiana history stuff.  Im sure thats part of it but you know what I think plays a larger role? Our culture.  Our special snowflake  no place like us  ya gotta be half crazy to live here culture.  Bear with me now eye rollers  my mom lived in the quarter in the s. She had all these great old pics of partying  dancing  parades  bourbon street  music scenes etc.. In all these great old photos the crowd is mixed.  The glue that holds us together in this town is our music food  and carnival.  All of these things we take part in together!I know it wasnt always together together.  We did have separate carnival and the food was most often cooked and served by the black service industry but music has always been a great equalizer. Blacks and whites played side by side and gave zero fucks about race earlier here than almost anywhere else in the country.  What mattered was talent and soul as it should be.So weve already got that stuff going for us and add to it a majority minority city by the time I was coming up.

3872684,0,t1_cqx24a1,I think Im the only person who genuinely enjoyed the fight. I have no idea what people were expecting. That is literally how Mayweather has fought and won all of his fights at least the ones that he didnt end early by completely dominating people.I think people are mad because it wasnt a slug fest and they were rooting for the under dog and he lost. But anyone who knows anything about Mayweather knew thats how the fight was going to be.Not only that Pacquiao said he knew Mayweathers strategy going into the fight he said Mayweather had slow footwork and basically talked a lot of crap about how he was going to outclass him in every way. But at the end of the night he had  hits and Mayweather had double that and he also threw a lot more punches than Mayweather. And if Pacquiao hadnt been losing on offense the entire fight theres no way hed have survived defense against Mayweather. Pacquiao couldnt counter his way out of Mayweather. Again the man lost to his boxing and thats what was being watched boxing. Not brawling not MMA boxing.So not only was he unable to do what he said he was going to do and what he said he had trained to do but he lost in the number of hits too? When he was throwing a lot more? Really theres no excuse for people to keep giving him. He put in a great effort but the man lost.I even like the guy and his boxing. Why does it hurt so many people to say he lost?,NewOrleans,cqxpwfu,2,t5_2qhp5

He helped mitigate the long term damage of reconstruction. He funded the freeing of slaves and moving them to Liberia as well as supporting free schools for them before and after the war all the while opposing their right to vote. He wasnt a pillar of virtue as viewed through our morals today but he did sacrifice for his idea of what was right. Dont you think it might be possible that there is something worth reflecting on in there?Btw I dont mean any of that last part to relate to this statue and street name garbage. This comment is only with regard to such people as Lee. You seem to think he is a one dimensional and evil.

Somewhere where you can experience the true culture of New Orleans.Its good that the area you are looking at has the surveillance cams.

4846912,1,t1_cu5ejci,Sadly the bullshit level at that site is rather high. Just a few brief debunkingsgtBernie is Jewish but he does not favor Israel over PalestineNonsense. Bernie lived on a kibbutz as a young man and has consistently supported every Israeli massacre. This video should clarify things for yougtBernie believes that Israel and Palestine can and should peacefully coexist and that Palestinians should have a country of their own.Why should anyone accept two states separate and unequal? Should the French have accepted German occupation in  and just surrendered to whatever the Nazi occupation desired? That is a close parallel to the Washington consensus on the socalled two state solution one in which the Zionist occupation remains in control while the Palestinian statelet would be far less than sovereign.gtBernie is not a big supporter of Israeli prime minister Benjamin NetanyahuSo he is just a minor supporter?gtBernie hopes that the United States will help broker a twostate solutionMore nonsense. The US has consistently aided and abetted Israel. The socalled two state solution is not going to happen and hope is not a plan. Israels only hope for attaining some form of legitimacy would be to transition to democracy with equal rights and equal citizenship for all. Theyd also have to let all the refugees return.gtBernie believes both sides have to own up to their failuresAgain its like asking the French to own up to their own failures in not giving the Germans total accommodation in . The Zionists stole the land the Palestinians want it back. While there are many more complexities at the core its really that simple. The Palestinians have an absolute right to selfdefense against the Zionist invasion and occupation just as the French Resistance had a right to fight back against the Nazis.,NewOrleans,cu5hmpp,-4,t5_2qhp5

6141056,0,t1_cynlh98,gt If you asked  people on the streets of the USA to name a single middle eastern inventorphilosopherleader I doubt you would get many answers. My point was just that thats because we have a Westerncentric education system. The ignorance of Americans about world history doesnt change world history it just makes them ignorant.  years ago Europe was massive shithole too. The West didnt have much to offer until about the th century and thats only if you consider Italy to be part of Europe an idea that has passed in and out of favor repeatedly throughout world history. Other civilizations were on top just as they had been before and maybe will be again. Our accomplishments are standing on the shoulders of theirs. If you stopped  people on the streets of Kabul to name an American inventor or philosopher you might look at it a little differently. There are still countries in Europe that are so far behind the Middle East. Its all relative.We tell ourselves stories to make us feel superior and then we end up believing they are true.

6559747,0,t1_czviq0w,Boy do I! I actually wrote my thesis on the issue of racial identity among Sicilian Americans in Louisiana. Its called Three From the Bottom if you were so inclined to google it at the very least to look at my bibliography for resources. One of the things that has been argued and that I agree with is that southern italianssicilians were considered nonwhite for many decades. Over the years and through assimilation they came to be adopted into white culture. One way they proclaimed their white identity is through racism. In order to distance themselves from the Black folks they were associated with many became aggressively racist like some in my family. In fact the Black Digilormos are not allowed at the family reunions because of my grandfather. If youre just looking for a starting point Jennifer Guiglielmos Are Italians White? is a good one. But for sources specific to Louisiana hit me up and I can share some articlespdfs if you like. I have tons saved on my computer from when I was doing my research. The problem with keeping up with race is that race is not biological in nature. It is solely social. So the defining characeristics change over time and from culture to culture. Race only exists in our minds and even then we cant agree on what defines it most of the time is it phenotype? behavior? culture? clothes? language? etc. etc..,NewOrleans,czxtyxb,2,t5_2qhp5

8192721,0,t1_d51itw0,a Some people are likely downvoting the pun.b Everything will not be  automated tomorrow or even in the next decade. There is a lot of automation in the Port already but the price point on automating vs. having a human do the job still favors humans as it will for a while due to the complex nature of working near water. As automation happens the jobs transition with it. Many of the Port jobs require more skill and knowledge than people think because it is just moving freight right? and not understanding how complex that actually is.c You could make a point about the local economy having to absorb up to  more nontourism jobs and have a better response. You chose to bitch about Turk not liking transplants instead which destroys your argument attacking the person instead of the issue.d Nothing will ever be  automated until the machine rise up and crush humanity like the fleshly little sacks of mostly water that we are. Capitalism is based on selling and consuming goods and services. That isnt going to change if more labor intensive jobs like OTR trucking becomes more automated. some sectors will suffer more than others and retraining a workforce is a serious economic hit but capitalism isnt going to collapse again until the machines rise up because somebody forgot to program the Three Laws of Robotics correctly and somebody else rubberstamped the QA process to meet an arbitrary release date to justify somebody elses bonus structure.,NewOrleans,d51n3zb,6,t5_2qhp5
8196123,0,t1_d51i7xs,I dont think the bananas youre buying have suddenly changed simply because almost all grocery bananas are of the Cavendish cultivar unless youre at an Asian or Latino grocery. There are subcultivars of Cavendish Chiqituas is the Grand Naine. Cavendish bananas ship well and have become the default cultivar since the s when the Gros Michel cultivar was decimated by a fungus. Bananas grown commercially are cultivated by cloning which means theres no genetic diversity to fall back on when theyre threatened. The Cavendish itself is now threatened by a fungus similar to the one that took out the Gros Michel.Theres a really interesting segment in On Food and Cooking on fruit harvesting and ripening. I cant do it justice but basically some fruits will ripen off the tree and some wont. Some will only ripen once theyre off the tree. Bananas ripen on the stem until theyre picked at which point the ripening process ceases. Ripe bananas dont ship well so theyre picked green and shipped unripe in a stage of arrested development. Prior to being sold ethylene gas is used to spur the ripening process on again and theyre then put out to sell. Keep in mind that fruits are plants ovaries. Its more complicated than youd think to get a perfect piece of fruit. Thanks to refrigerated shipping mechanized harvesting fertilizers and insecticides weve become used to the artificial conditions growers create. And growers create them in turn to feed peoples peculiar preferences and to increase their own profits. Its pretty rare though that humans are able to perfectly replicate the conditions nature creates. A lot of what we eat isnt even the best its just the bestselling. Yes we can technically buy peaches in winter thanks to refrigerated shipping and Chilean fruit growers but that hard lump you coax to ripeness in a paper bag can never compare to the succulence of a perfectly ripe Georgia peach you buy from a farmers truck. ,NewOrleans,d522gck,1,t5_2qhp5

8215727,1,t1_d54cgrs,I suppose I should have worded my question differently I am particularly interested in how marymangos statement was regressive and oblivious not the alleged result of statements like hers.I do feel a need to address your assertion that black people commit more crime.  You are incorrect.Raw FBI data from  on the number of arrests by raceAs you can see from this source raw numbers for black arrests    are LOWER than raw numbers of white arrests and represent just under  of TOTAL arrests whereas white arrests make up just over .The Kaiser Family Foundation population numbers for From this site you can see that black people total  and white people total  however if you pay attention to the FBI number above you can see that LatinoHispanic people are included in the white arrests total and they number  so white and Hispanic together is .  This means that black arrests represent just over  of the black American population and white arrests represent just over  of the whiteHispanic population and if you isolate the white population alone you get nearly  of the white population alone. Given those numbers which you did not with no context I can see how one might believe your assertion.  Now the issue with using arrests as a measure is problematic because many argue that black people are arrested at an artificially high rate but unfortunately there is no FBI data for conviction rates but even THAT becomes problematic when you realize that black people are also disproportionally likely to need a public defender be unable to make bailbond and likely to plead guilty in exchange for a reduced sentence as a result rather than facing a sure conviction with a disinterested or overworked public defender.Raw number of black children in poverty has surpassed the raw number of white children in poverty  This means that black children are INCREDIBLY more likely to come from a poor family and we know one of the biggest contributors to criminal activity is economic disadvantageAdditional resourcesSo actually it is your assertion that black people commit more crime that is both oblivious and regressive because you are failing to consider the full reality of being black in America.

9101775,0,t3_54vdlk,gt . Strolling Outside of CBD daytime and French Quarter not many people seem to be taking walks.  Why is that? Personally even in September heat I feel like I would enjoy strolling and biking in Treme MidCity Garden District Marigny Lakeview Filmore but I didnt see many people on the streets while biking through these neighborhoods day or night. Its hot as balls most of the time and it rains all the time. Driving is a necessity to arrive dry and clean and smelling nice most of the time so it becomes a habit.gt . Size The city was smaller than I expected. Biking across the city Audubon to City Park Arabi to West End was comfortably doable. Does it feel like a small citytown to you? It actually stretches pretty far to the east but there are few reasons for a tourist to go out there. Midcity uptown the quarter the cbd and the marigny are all fairly close to each other. The entire metro is between  and . million people but maybe k live in the parts most people frequent.gt . Gentrification Where in the city is gentrification most rapid? If they include Marigny Freret St Treme Id say its quite mild here. Gentrification is not the tearing down of buildings although that does happen but the raising of prices so quickly it displaces long term residents. Prices in some areas have gone up x in a decade but the houses look exactly the same.  But some neighborhoods more than others. Treme is happening now but the bywayer and marigny have been ongoing for some time.gt . Lower Ninth Ward What is the pervasive perception of Lower Ninth? Your personal perception? I visited it as part of the bike tour and also by myself and I felt welcomed and safe everyone waved back and smiled when I did. But there was also a weight in the air. There seems to be frustration of everything thats working against the inhabitants whether it be natural racial bureaucratic corporate etc. Dont go at night but dont expect to be killed on site. Its a rough neighborhood with plenty of nice people in it.gt . Niceness One of the benefits ? of living in Chicago is that one can be perpetually grumpybrooding. So question for the transplants Do you feel pressured to be nice?  Its natural it doesnt feel pressured. It is the way we were raised.gt . Food store Some corner stores seem to sell far more prepared foods than household goods the Orange Place Manchu. Why dont they just become a restaurant? Or downsize and save rent? Is this a tax or city license issue?Yes and no. Being a restaurant takes more licenses and inspections and insurance. It also takes more capital investment staff and is a different business model. Maybe they dont want to or maybe they cant afford it. Why isnt every corner store a restaurant everywhere?gt . AirBnB Saw many antiAirBnB signs in French Quarter. Judging from this thread this sub seems proAirBnB. Are there legitimate reasons to be against AirBnB?Yes. Many people who stay in them are disrespectful of the neighbors. Much of our economy is tourism and airbnb places skirt tax laws that pay for infrastructure. For better or worse airbnb seems to be driving real estate prices up because short term rentals can generate more income than long term so neighborhoods are becoming less and less of a community as high prices drive out long term residents and the houses themselves are temporarily occupied by people who arent in the community.gt . Local produce  products I visited a Rouses and a Whole Foods. Both had very few local products outside of gulf seafood. Corner stores also seemed unlikely to have them. Are local produce and products unavailable or was I not looking in the right places? Maybe it is not obvious which products are local? Even Costco here sells giant boxes of local sausage and so forth. Rouses has tons of stuff.gt . Gardens Are people growing things? It seems counterintuitive that I see more farms and vegetable gardens in urban Chicago than in New Orleans. There are a few community gardens but yards are small and culturally we like relaxing in our yards. There may also be city rules making it difficult but no one I know even considers using what little grass they have for anything other than playing with kids and dogs.gt . Fastfood chains I wish I had the chance to try them but I was excited by fast foodscape smoothie king raising cane popeyes. Whats your favorite?Popeyes or GTFOgt . Grits What texture are grits supposed to have? I have very little exposure so I ordered them whenever I could while here. I always thought grits were supposed to be ... gritty. So closer to blackberries than oatmeal or porridge. The ones I had were all quite creamy.  They are creamy but should not be like oatmeal. Every place is a little different.gt . Race relations This last one is more of a reflection than a question. gt As a Chinese American I felt that New Orleans was the first US city I visited where my skin color disappeared. Whiteblack relations are complex and I wont pretend to know what Im talking about there. But everyone I met white and black treated me with respect and more importantly the same treatment as everyone else. gt Maybe its that theres not enough of us to form an enclave or a stereotype. Or that East Asians in Louisiana do not have the same economic distance from AfAm as in LASF. Actually it might be the almighty yakamein.We have a very large Vietnamese community in the east and while I dont know how large our Chinese population is there are enough Chinese people such that I have Chinese friends and run into Chinese people regularly without going out of my way.I think that many people who interact with tourists put prejudice aside to some degree because their paychecks depend on it. As a tourist you likely interacted with these people at a fairly high rate relative to what you would if you lived here for years.There are plenty of assholes who hate or distrust or dislike or fear people of other races here black white and Asian. More than that there are a bunch of people here who arent openly racist and probably make some effort not to be racist but are still prejudicial against people of other races  I think this is the majority of Americans and the majority of people here.Then we have institutionalize racism. Black politicians who earn power and money for themselves by villainizing white people promising to stand up for blacks who should continue to play the victim who stir up the racial divide because without it they would have no power base.White politicians who subtly play the race card for their own benefit. They villainize black people as welfare recipients sucking the life out of hard working white American paychecks out to rape your wife and rob your house. They stir up the racial divide because without it they have no power.And then you have the economic impact of the fact that black people have lower incomes than white people on average and that tends to have an impact on school quality which has an impact on future earning potential which introduces a cycle.And then you have the fact that poorer areas have more crime and since black people have lower incomes they tend to live in more high crime areas. Policeman patrol these areas and see most of the arrests they make being black people and human nature has a way of turning this into an implicit assumption of black guilt more frequently than white guilt and there you have some institutional racism.And conviction rates and jail time win prosecutors and  judges reelections in high crime cities and since black people have lower incomes they donate less to campaigns and have less money to defend themselves so if you are shooting for conviction rate to brag about at reelection time you throw the book at black people. This introduces another cycle of institutional racism because convicts cant get jobs have lower incomes turn to crime and go to jail. Now kids are raised without fathers police see black people disproportionately commit crimes voters vote for prosecutors who win and judges who punish and so on.Plus slavery was pretty big here for hundreds of years.So yeah it can be tough but on a one on one level most people are pretty decent to one another.,NewOrleans,d85vyjs,11,t5_2qhp5

Their primary function is selling services  and as often as possible.  I bet you get a few sales calls from them telling you its time to do this or that tack on extra money and stuff.  Case in point  My dads house had a detached garage that had some termite issues.  He called his home warranty people they sent out the Orkin man.   year old kid shows up does his big spiel and inspection and then says no termites.  Then my dad literally flips the door they were standing next to and shows him...kid never closed to the door to look behind it.  Anyway you live in New Orleans....HIRE A LOCAL GUY.  A mom and pop type deal where its that guys livelihood.  Hell take better care of you than a corporate BS pest control service.  Ive got a guy  does strictly termite stuff.  He costs half of what the big guys charge and if my house doesnt need to be resprayed hell tell me we can wait.  And their success is directly related to your being satisfied and doing a good job.

The constitution was written not to protect those we agree with but those who wouldnt be protected otherwise.

So what happens if someone in the city wants to leak some footage of a political adversary?  Is there really crime on Bourbon that goes unsolved?

Same thing all consumers competition breeds value. You will be able to not get coverage for things you for reasons that defy logic dont want. Dont want ladies in your family to have BC covered? Fuckem you can save the  bucks monthly and raise your unwanted kids Murica. not everyone wants to go to doctorhave insurance so why force them? If I only want to go for emergencies what business is it of yours you know why?  If hosptials want to cater to certain types of cases thats choice choice is good. Surely they wont curb the poorminorities merely cause. Fed Govt is inefficient. Any thing they do States could do cheaper merely by saving on admin burden so we will get more bang for our buck and states that are more libertarian get to stay more liberatian what business is it of yours. Local polices can better reflect local mores. If people want therapy to stop being gay what business is it of yours? If a town wants no vaccines what business is it of yours? If a town wants there to be a mandatory Priest consultation what business is it of yours? Locals can better police fraudabuse cause we are more aware to the issue.

11567846,0,t1_dg6yoe8,Well I definitely think this is true though for sales rather than long term rentals.  Typically people with mortgages take a loooong time to settle for significantly lower rents that wont pay the bills.

11628557,0,t3_65y5vd,Mark Twain abhorred slavery but still joined the Confederacy during the Civil War. Human beings are such fascinatingly complex creatures.But I cant help but feel like he was probably secretly a racist in general and a white supremacist in particular. Sure he only joined for a few weeks before fleeing west and was considered a traitor to the cause. Who cares? He used the shit out of the word nigger in Huckleberry Fin amirite?I think we should march on Missouri next. I think theres like a few dozen statues of him there.

Generally it is proposed as a fun wholesome activity that helps provide something for kids to do in areas that lack anything for kids to do.

That sounds like the city requested them.Secondlygt Having paramedics on scene in this kind of situation is perfectly reasonable.No its not. Having police on scene is reasonable  thats their job. Given the fact that the crews were wearing body armor the city must have had a reasonable suspicion that something might happen. If thats the case firemen  paramedics should have been nowhere near the scene. Just like in an active shooter situation the paramedics dont rush in. They wait for the cops to neutralize the scene and then the paramedics enter.,NewOrleans,dgu9cdi,9,t5_2qhp5
11780232,1,t3_682uic,gtHe said the circle around the Lee column could be turned into a fountain with statues representing various aspects of New Orleans people and culture and renamed Tricentennial Circle in honor of the citys th birthday next year.      ...and this is where the bigots historians and bigotstorians get points. mitch fails at some very basic New Orleanian shit. Maybe too many years in Baton Rouge ruined his brain stem? WE dont recognize shit having a new name here. That does nothing. The CCC stills comes off in my head as the GNO. Armstrong in my head is still Moisant. and fucks sake I aint even from here my whole life. Like how does this dude not know the new name has to have Lee in it even if its fuckin Lee Dorsey Sara Lee Lee Harvey Oswald Bruce Lee Spike Lee Lee Marvin or Lee goddamn Zurik?     Im beginning to think there was a body switch in baton rouge.    edit to add  a statue of lee marvin with an automatic in one hand a a glass of bourbon in the other would be harsh as hell. ,NewOrleans,dgvbs8k,0,t5_2qhp5
