8778932,0,t3_50d306,Whats poppin guys hope everyone is blessed.This is the first mixtape i have made after  months of producing daily. Its got a boom bap vibe to it and the beats are quite basic but im still proud of it!Ive been unsure about dropping this to the public i have put it as a name your price download on bandcamp. Due to the nature of the acapellas being used by famous artists and the fear of copyright problems i just wanted to make it clear that this is a charity mixtape and if anyone actually buys this  of the money raised will be going to the charity JusB. They are local to me South London and help the youth in the area through their problems they have a music studio which they let the kids use to keep them off the streets and out of trouble.You can support them here  Hopefully this will stay up and i will not catch a case or whatever i know Jay Zs guys are on job when it comes to the copyright but i am just trying to do some good so hopefully there will be no problems.Big ups to all the listeners if you like what you hear and want to watch me grow as an artist you can follow my soundcloud at  Expect new mixtapes landing soon i am always looking for talent to work with so get at me on zootzotboutlook.com and we can make these hits. Stay breezy yo,unheardof,d731b77,1,t5_2rzhy
9103996,0,t3_54z0jd,    High guys thank you for having a listen I really appreciate it.    I am an independent artist currently surfing singing and smiling in my sunny studio in Mexico. I record because sometimes the music is inside of you and it has to come out or you cant sleep. You know what I mean?    This is my new single When Youre Bad. Its available for free streaming on Soundcloud Youtube etc. If you like vodka cigarettes leather and decadence youll love this track.
