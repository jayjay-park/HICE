5314967,0,t3_3nt83d,Sorry about the thread being created a little late still getting used to it and I completely forgot there would be tennis way earlier in the morning with the tournaments going on in ChinaJapan and all.Anyhow right on Im looing at S. Querrey vs K. Nishikori thinking about betting over . sets. I have a feeling Querrey wont make it easy for Nishikori even though hes playing at home. Maybe even the correct score Nishikori to win   .. Of the last  matches Querrey lost   were lost  sets the other one being  at the US open.,TennisBetting,cvr1slf,2,t5_334xi
