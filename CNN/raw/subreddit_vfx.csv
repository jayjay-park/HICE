105412,0,t1_ceqb7vr,Go compare the best work from Blender to Maya or DsMax. It doesnt come close to the control and realism you can acheive. I will say Im very novice to Blender and very advanced in Maya so theres a bit of a bias there. To put it into context why it sucks take a look at CinemaD renders. They all look very sharp smooth and vibrant. Its apart of the algorithms of the program. VRay even looks weird in the program to me and its the closest you can get to photoreal with the program. Many artists Ive talked to at the best post shops in the US hate it for this reason. Everything in blender comes out very similar in look smooth. Do a google image search for blender art and find something that looks  real. Sure some stuff comes close but with Maya and DsMax its hard to tell the difference sometimes. ,vfx,ceqfku6,1,t5_2qhfw

629332,0,t1_cg9x746,Learning Katana is hard to do unless you work at a studio that uses Katana. Unless its changed a lot recently with some more readytowear build being made commercially available I think the plainvanilla version you get when you first buy it is just a framework into which a studio is supposed to build its own tools and pipeline connections. I guess this goes back to what you said about highend lighting being proprietary  Katana exists mostly as a box for a studios proprietary tools to work in.Houdini is a great tool for any TD especially people interested in effects and Houdini is something anyone with enough time can learn. It doesnt seem essential to lighting though. If a lighting specialist were looking to branch out getting to be a real Nuke expert and good at compositing seems like it might be a more natural compliment to a good lighting reel.,vfx,cgbt0u8,1,t5_2qhfw

988540,0,t3_25fdde,First impression its way too long and slow. No recruiter is gonna sit through the entire reel. The  pieces could easily be  seconds long each. Professionals know the techniques youre using so you dont need to slow it down for them to understand it theyve seen it all. There were a few times where it looked like you showed the same mattes multiple times like where the giraffes were white then red. It looked like nothing changed so it wasnt necessary. So yeah as far as delivery of the reel shorten it and make it quicker. Super boring right now.Regarding the actual content I think the pieces werent bad at all. Nothing crazy amazing though. I think you could definitely use a couple more pieces to round out the skills you have. It didnt seem like there was anything tracking related D or matchmove or paint fix related. Just an idea to help round it out.The beach comp had a small issue I think. The hills you put on D cards were noticeably sliding against the foreground it seemed didnt look like it was intended parallax. Also they were completely flat so their perspective was off and they felt flat when you moved by them. You should try projecting them onto geo that more closely matches a hill shape so the base of the hill moves faster than the peak.Also the hot air balloon in the last one looked like it had a faint black border around it which is usually some form of comp issue. If not then I think it should be removed either way. The balloon also seemed really large for some reason in relation to the mountain it is behind. If its really that far away it should be like a quarter the size it is now.The giraffe project looked good I could be wrong so dont accept everything I said just my initial thoughts.,vfx,chgnkfq,9,t5_2qhfw

Period. Its the industry standard. And now that NukeX comes with a NukeAssist licence I think youre going to see most facilities using Nuke for rotopaint as well as comp not that they werent already but more so now.And you cant do really challenging paint work in Mocha or Silhouette really.

IOW for every dollar of stock you buy youre actually getting much more than a dollar in value.  In the longer term the stock market tends to bring prices to their actual value.Buffet has said for many years that he is in the business of buying dollar bills for fifty cents.Apple is a great example.  Even five years ago they had incredible earnings they brand was a huge moat against competition but their PE was low because the press hated them.

Irrelevant.gt They are paid based on their skill which is usually not that much...And these skills have nothing to do with anything on a reel.  Next.gt They have access to attend all training courses that are presented have direct access to oscar winning supervisors in their fields and can use all the software and footage which is really hard to get they want in their own time...Im assuming then that the receptionist and security and any staff custodial people have similar access?  Do they need a reel too?  That would be...odd.gt Its also good gauge to also see their dedication and personality. In that position you get out what you put in...Mmmm a reel?  Sorry but no you cannot tell a persons personality or dedication based on a reel.  You cannot tell if someone is going to be organized enough or follow instructions enough to not screw up as a runner based on a reel.  The needs of the position theyre trying to be hired for are not found in a reel.What is found in a reel is something to file away in case you want to exploit their ability for a period but keep paying them their menial entry level salary.  There is that yes.  When the time comes that the work out strips staffing and budget and it always seems to do that you have people you can tap that you dont have to pay initially for the services they might render and if they dont work out they go back to fetching coffee taking notes driving around and picking up groceries and supplies.  Facility based mostly administrative duties. I wonder if Starbucks should require demo reels of their baristas...perhaps UPS and similar parcelpost delivery services should consider it for their folks.  Maybe just in the UK...gt Considering some of the VFX supes were former runners something must be working...Thats a bullshit argument.  We had tape ops and receptionists at Digital Domain with aerospace degrees one from MIT.  They couldnt get a job in their field didnt have the necessary experience or skill to directly work in ours.  Both parties were lucky in this case but does it mean we scour the out of work engineers to fill these positions after theyve moved on?  Oh you dont have at least a Masters degree well you cant answer our phones sorry.  That last guy worked out really well for us.  Try the boutique down the street they might not need Ivy League to make runs to Costco or fetch coffee.gt If however they have the skill to be a paint and roto person or a d artist they can just right past the runner position straight in to those roles...Then why the pantomime?  What of the position that still needs doing by someone whos going to be good at it and who isnt from the very first day looking to get out of it and into what they really want?  to say nothing for the fact that someone who does a good job as a runner displays traits expressly valuable for production management has no artistic value at all and implies time management and organizational skills you maybe hope an artist might have but ultimately its still not a direct translation of time spent or experience acquired actually you know running.Sorry I dont respect the practice and Ive been doing this long enough that the justifications are meaningless.

3961878,0,t1_cr7sz2w,Any parameter in After Effects can be animated by an expression instead of keyframes.  You hold Alt while clicking on the stopwatch and it drops you into expression mode.  wiggle is one of the most used expressions Id guess because it adds random though smooth motion into that channel.   It takes a magnitude and frequency parameter or how big to wiggle and how fast to wiggle.Look for the little arrow near the expression window which will pop up a menu of prebuilt expressions to drop in there.  I believe wiggle is under a random or noise submenu.For even more random animation theres the noise expression and a variety of different types.  Ill usually use the noise that lets me define a minimum and maximum value to jitter between.  Even though it was a mistake for Adobe to design the expression language around Java the fact that its there is one of After Effects single most powerful features and what keeps it from being just the toy that its often accused of being.There are just loads of online examples and tutorials involving wiggle so I suggest you start there so you can see how it works before applying it to your own file.,vfx,cr7vyng,2,t5_2qhfw

4866828,0,t3_3hjdbm,VFX as a job is fantastic its difficult challenging technical artistic youre constantly being forced to learn and improve your skills and the shit you do ends up on movie screens and tvs worldwide.That part of the job is fuckin awesome.VFX as a career however is pretty well fucked right now. The UK Canada amp To a lesser degree Singapore Australia amp NZ have all decided they want to buy the industry primarily because theyve been conned into thinking it actually makes money by those slimy bastards at the MPAA so theyre dumping hundreds of millions in taxpayer money into bribes to entice studios to send work there.  Consequently the primary qualifications for the job are not whether youre actually any good or not its whether you have the right passport  seriously the head of recruiting at MPC listed  things to set you apart as a new hire and  was Be Canadian.Over the past couple of years the US VFX industry has been decimated by foreign subsidies RampH is all but gone DD is a shell of what it was and Imageworks actually relocated to Vancouver they still have an LA office but its tiny. What this means for you as an Im assuming American is that youll find it very hard to get hired into the US VFX industry out of school even coming from SCAD which has a pretty decent reputation and as a new graduate you wont be able to get a visa for a foreign company.Even if you somehow managed to land at one of the subsidized studios if their legislators ever do the math and scrap the subsidies youll end up chasing your job to whichever idiot location is giving away free money next  thats great if youre young and want to travel but it kind of blows if you ever want a family or a non mobile home  and I dont buy the bullshit that this is supposed to be a migrant worker industry were not picking fucking fruit without subsidies none of this would be happening. I also dont buy the without subsidies all the work will go to India amp China because even with subsidies theyre a lot cheaper than we are if the work were going to go there it would have done it by now.So yeah right now VFX for film amp tv is rife with bullshit you dont want to have to deal with if you want any kind of stability in your life  the good news of course is that it might all go away during the next election cycles in the relevant locales assuming you arent one of the guys employed by companies who rely on those subsidies.Right now I would aim for an industry with a shittier lobbying arm.Architecture is stable but insanely competitive games amp realtime effects are much the same.  The only advice I can give you is to go technical  people with a combination of technical and artistic skills are few and far between. Stick to modules with transferable skills so learn physics learn math learn C learn Python dont bother studying Maya or Houdini specifically if you know the fundamentals you can pick up any package pretty easily.,vfx,cu801i9,16,t5_2qhfw

These lovely words come up a lot but its a concept that is abstracted from the real world requirements of what it takes to do effects specifically.Of the packages listed Maya is going to be the most capable for effects since it has a more robust starting toolset by a wide margin compared to either Modo or CD while providing multiple means for the user to extend the capability of the package.

5605531,0,t1_cwqslf5,Referring to the bit about needing the history of the object to determine rotation I hope this is not coming in at too much of a side angle here but the videoclip by the OP shows perfectly natural behavior for a ball skidding about on an oiled surface. So if there was a surface that acted as an interactive damperdrag would that give more control to the roll of the ball? assuming such a controller is possible sans simulator. Also I work in DS Max my knowledge of Maya is weak by comparison sorry. I was fooling around with the same problem and went down the particle path where I made the ball a single geometry referencing particle that inherited motion and direction from its emitter. Wasnt a perfect solution as I am more of an animator than a particles wizard! But possibly a different angle to consider? It did allow me to control the amount each axis rolled by.

7574758,0,t3_4iykz5,My honest opinion...dont be in too much of a rush to get titles like lead or supe. Ive spent the last few years in the industry desperately trying to climb the slippery pole as fast as possible but have since decided to take a step back and just enjoy the job and enjoy life. Its a lot less stressful.Sounds like youre in school...it can be super competitive at that stage in your career and its normal to feel what youre feeling well tbh it gets even more competitive further down the line. Ive often seen people who I felt didnt deserve the successresponsiblity moving further up the ladder and it can make you feel like shit. But having been in the industry maybe  years or so now since graduating I realised that the hard work and time spent building good relationships with people and refining your skills pays off in the end and things start to balance out. You eventually reach a stage where the weakerless interested people who can blag stuff in the beginning start to drop off...but then youre left competing with people who are actually fucking incredible artists.Sounds to me like you supervisors already know what you can do and are trying to give opportunity to someone less experienced...which isnt a bad thing if you are in school.,vfx,d337ogn,1,t5_2qhfw

10249609,0,t1_dc5tyro,The thing is mate stress comes from within. And when people say stress makes you look older theyre not joking. Your body really does burn up more quickly under stress than it otherwise would.You must specifically focus from tomorrow onwards on what is causing you stress both inside and outside work. I.e. My boss has demanded ltxgt by ltygt and then drill in to why you have the emotional and physical reactions that you do. I.e. I dont think I can do ltxgt by ltygt and if I dont do it things will go badly for me. And then keep asking Kaizenstyle why? until you come up against something that you can personally affect. Like instead of feeling you have to say yes or no to a difficult request you can say Yes but only if I can drop quality by ltzgt or extend time by lttgt. Your colleagues respect you and if you say something can be done by a time then theyre likely to believe you because youve a lot of relevant experience. This should be no different to responding when the impossible is asked for. Apply your relevant experience to the issue at hand.In the real world I herd a lot of cats.

I started with a garbage matte made with a single mask and a key range with a matte expansion to leave me with the figure and a little green surrounding it. Then I increased the saturation and vibrance since I knew the best chance to key it would be with color channels. I then used the Channel mixer to reduce the red channel and boost the green in monochrome mode. This with some crunching made a decent yet crunchy matte. I put that in a precomp with a refine soft matte and ended up with this result. AE project file and render here. The results are probably even better with original footage.,vfx,ddjh20q,2,t5_2qhfw

It pulls the blacks upwhich are usually abig source of noise and enables the sampler to work better. This isnt baked into your render its only forsampling. So you exr output would still be linear. File input and output gamma should be set to . you can set it in the script editor as follows.fileInGamma  .fileOutGamma  .This means if youve made your input textures all linear you dont have to do anything. If you havent then youcan tick the override and set the gamma to what was baked into the texture jpg tends to be ..By doing that it applies the inverse of the gamma that was baked into your image and linearizes it.Now it will play nicer during rendering. Your monitor will be calibrated to sRGB so you want the UI and colour pickerin Max to be sRGB which is . though honestly I dont know many people who use the eye dropper to grabcolour values from the UI. Now if you arent using textures in your diffuse slot and youre just setting a colour directly you need to put a colour correct in the diffuse slot and set its correction to . then you can set your colour from inside there.,vfx,dgcwx95,2,t5_2qhfw
