241958,0,t3_1wtv9i,Well my New Years Resolution was to read more... In the past  years I must have finished about  books. I did a lot of reading in terms of articles online but very few books. But I can say that this has now changed. I have joined up on Goodreads and their reading challenge. Challenging myself to  books this year.In the last  months I have mangedI Am Malala  Absolutely brilliant into the insight of living in Pakistan and the effects of the Taliban on real people in the area. Very inspiring and a reality check of how lucky we are to be able to go to school male or female. Alex Ferguson My Autobiography  Really wasnt what it could have been. An insight to what made the man a great manager would have been nice. But instead he touched on subjects he had no need to attacked Rafa and brought up a few old gripes that most of the details we already knew. Just seemed nothing new. For any football fan worth a brief read through but dont expect too much.I am Zlatan Ibrahmovic  Now this book was excellent opinionated and you get a better understanding of Zlatans genius fight and why he is such an arrogant twat. But I thought likable. You did genuinely get a insiders look in this book what he thought about people around him and personalities that have molded Zlatan. A Game of Thrones  I dont think there is many that havent watched the TV show. I had and thought what better way to get myself stuck into some novels. A fantastic read. I enjoyed that I had in my head an idea of who the characters where in the TV series and the novel really just brought the world more to life for me. I got a better sense of depth of the character and a better idea of the politics and goings on especially of the smaller houses. It was a massive read for me and I am taking a rest until I go to the second one but really enjoyed it.The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets by Simon Singh  Now I love The Simpsons and Futurama I basically grew up watching it. Especially since my dad was one of the first people to adopt Sky TV. I never knew there was anything going on in the background with maths. Not a subject I had too much love for at school where I gained my C at GCSE after retaking it in sixth form college. But I have a better love for numbers now and gave this a go and really enjoyed it. A mixture of behind the scenes at The Simpsons and stories of maths as well as an very easy to understand explanation of the maths that can be found in the show. I cant pretend that I understood or could recite all I read but I did enjoy reading it.Just currently reading a novel of the year The Ocean at the End of The Lane by Neil Gaiman  So far so good I am enjoying the way he has written and the feeling of building the main character as a  year old with no friends. I have not go too far yet and I am just starting to get to the weird goings on. All in all I dont think I am doing too badly in my pursuit to read more.  ,TheRedLion,cf5txb9,1,t5_2vrbs

523015,0,t3_2021db,gt Ive recently lost..  stone in  months ish?Great work!gt i treat myself with an energy drink after work on friday.Tough love speech coming upDude that stuff is shit.  Start treating yourself several times a day with apples oranges and other naturally nummy stuff.  You need to retrain your taste buds so they dont think liquid sugar is a suitable reward.  Otherwise youre gonna spend the rest of your life fighting the sugar urge and being miserable as shit because youre not getting it.Also start doing more exercise.  It sucks at first particularly if youre overweight but itll make you feel better in the long run not just for losing weight  endorphins get released when you exercise and theyre powerful antidepressants.  The more calories you burn exercising the less you have to diet.Taking a dog for a walk for an hour a day or something like that is a great way to get exercise without noticing that youre actually exercising.  If you havent got a dog I bet youve got neighbours who might want their dogs walking.  You might even earn a few quid out of it in the process.  And you get to meet people even if its only saying good morning as you pass by.Youll have to trust me on this but I do know where youre coming from.gt Im always too afraid to comment.Dont be.

The only things I wouldnt advise  using after the  day rule is seafood as that is dodgy enough for people with experience to judge whether its safe.Some folk waste a hell of a lot of perfectly good food just because the label its too be used within a certain time.

If youd prefer to avoid cities then Linlithgow is pretty and mainly accessible.Or you could do Hadrians Wall and if you dont fancy walking it theres tourist buses between the towns and loads of guesthouses. Shrewsbury is on my list only ever been for really short visits but its where the Cadfael books are set and I believe theres some nice walks as well as some shops and Chirk castle isnt too far.Chester is one of my favourite places theres loads to do but the shopping areas will be busy especially at weekends or you could stay in a forest lodge somewhere.

10449187,0,t1_dcshci8,gt How long have you been hoarding that little lot?Since last weekend.  Dishwasher died beyond economical repair fridge has had a broken door kids climbing up the inside and the thermostat has been iffy for a while since I last mended it.  The little ones tube yogurts kept disappearing into a glacier that ran down the back.   The freezer was donated to me by my folks when I bought my first house about  years ago They replaced it as it was getting old so god knows how old it actually is and I think probably used to contribute about  of our leccy bill.Fixing stuff like that is more common sense than anything else and swap out parts.  There are loads of youtube vids to help now as well. All I am going to do is bipass  of the settings.  A couple of hours messing around and I should be able to not spend on a new controller board. which at  is a long way to getting a new machine for   I guess I hate living in a throwaway society but so many things have components in them that are not serviceable and cost the earth to repair. ,TheRedLion,dcsid8d,2,t5_2vrbs
