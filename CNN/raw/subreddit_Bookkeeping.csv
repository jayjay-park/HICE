2572114,0,t3_2p89q1,If you compare all the  entries and the  opening entry how big is the difference? Ideally they should be close and you can clear them against each other.,Bookkeeping,cmubaz4,2,t5_2r0vm

2751952,0,t3_2rkx57,My clients know that I am a bookkeeper. They usually already have their tax guy. They know im in their to be the day to day kind of guy. I always make it easy on the tax guy though. I give them a binder with all the necessary reports and backup for what they will find in the books. The tax accountants always seem surprised to get my stuff and are really thankful. If you can work together it makes the billables much less and the stress for the tax guy a lot simpler because its usually cut and dry and straight forward. ,Bookkeeping,cngvw4t,7,t5_2r0vm
2817552,0,t1_cnnlw3f,Its not spam.  It is a link to a legitimate website.  Its only two words so chill out and just ignore it if you dont like it!  I am a bookkeeper assisting others on here and I am sharing a link to my bookkeeping business  it is relevant.,Bookkeeping,cnockdy,0,t5_2r0vm
2846717,0,t1_cnriuvv,Theyre both. I encourage them to choose whichever theyll like more. I show them demos. My die hard desktop users are ones that have intuit credit card processing and they tried the QBO product. QBD gt QBO results in some goofiness but its easily fixed. Add that plus cc processing and someone who doesnt know QB but is a casual user and suddenly they flip their shit. They go back to QBD and wont consider QBO. Its cool Im easy peasy. ,Bookkeeping,cnro66b,2,t5_2r0vm
4821118,0,t1_cu28hpr,Sadly I would not. Ive had many clients try to give me full access to their online banking because its just easier! Uh no. Not just because its bad practice but to protect myself. You just know that the first charge they dont recognize on their statement will be blamed on me.,Bookkeeping,cu28pfz,1,t5_2r0vm
5306361,0,t3_3nno8p,The ProAdvisor listing is a big referral source for me. Some people just have SOS issues and end up being a onetime client but many times Ive gotten much larger projects because I show up for QB training and treat them better than their regular accountant does.If you do spring for it make the most of it. Your biggest advantage over other advisors and there will be a bunch is a really great first impression with your listing. My suggestions Its one fee but you can get certified for desktop online enterprise POS... do them all. With the exception of POS if thats something youre just not comfortable with. Get a good picture. Doesnt have to be a professional headshot but SERIOUSLY just spend  minutes googling something like DIY LinkedIn head shots. Too many people look like they just snapped a selfie in their moms basement. Nobodys gonna call you if you creep them out. Actually fill out the entire listing. Add a summary about my services or whatever those sections are. Dont make it a wall of text but at least give potential clients some personalized information. Once you work with a few good clients ask them to leave you a review there. The ProAdvisor site is much less stringent on background checking review sources than something like Yelp or Google and it will move you toward the top of the list if you have good reviews. Keep it updated. Might be kind of obvious but its easy to forgot about the listing if you move and get caught up changing really important stuff like business cards websites and the like.Overall I would absolutely say its been worth it to me just make sure you have a good foundation.,Bookkeeping,cvpy6cb,3,t5_2r0vm
5761892,0,t1_cxbak3o,Its material in the sense that on an accrual basis there will be significant  bad debt to revenue in .. but its not material in that the owner will understand why and not make any decisions based on this information. As for the tax return which I dont prepare and dont have a ton of experience with in general this shouldnt impact . They file on a cash basis so this expense wont be included as I understand it.. They have not paid tax on income for these invoices because they were never paid so no need to refile previous years. Otherwise I think we are in agreement. So is my boss whose a CPA so I think Im going to do what I said in my original post.  ,Bookkeeping,cxbbe89,2,t5_2r0vm
5785856,0,t3_3uavin,Its called AccountingAccountancy.  Try taking the Intro course and Intermediate Accounting.  Thatll pretty much touch on everything for the most part.  The further into it youll go the more specialized the classes get.  ,Bookkeeping,cxeah1e,1,t5_2r0vm
6353502,0,t1_czbpy3m,I am going to be using Quickbooks for this and Im going to use a square POS. I am hoping that I dont have to create separate inventory logs in both systems and that they will work together pretty seamlessly. So far I havent seen an option in Square to set COGS so I think there is going to be a lot of software learning I need to do. ,Bookkeeping,czbtmol,1,t5_2r0vm

6757774,0,t3_487zfm,There are two ways that people usually charge for bookkeeping.  I use a flat rate  of the time for my clients.  I look at the workload and estimate how long it will take based on the knowledge I have then I charge them that each month unless I notice that they are underoverpaying and then I give them a bunch of notice if it needs to change.The other is your hourly rate.  Your new so it wont be to high and I wouldnt charge for the QB consultation as that is for you not for them.  Anyways if it is not consistent this might be your best bet.  Keep an excel sheet open on your phone or computer and make notes of the times you start and stop all day everyday then bill at the end of the month.If you need some advice just PM me and I can try and give you so more details.,Bookkeeping,d0ib6ni,1,t5_2r0vm

10420369,0,t3_5p6sx9,Bookkeeping isnt rocket science and with enough time you could probably figure it all out on your own.  But is it really a good use of your time?  Its probably better to outsource it and use that time selling or working on other aspects of your business. ,Bookkeeping,dcp7ueg,3,t5_2r0vm

11053434,0,t3_5xrlhm,Yes I have but it takes a lot of hand holding. One advice I give them all and it really helps is to open a QB account for their personal finances and run it like a business. This will help a lot with the training and its safe cause its not the clients QB. ,Bookkeeping,dekvz50,3,t5_2r0vm
