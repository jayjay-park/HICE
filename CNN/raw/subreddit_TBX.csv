5148615,0,t3_3lgej6,I didnt like it either in fact I didnt finish it the first night but Im still going to give it a few episodes before I call off or commit to watching it further. Im actually surprised to see so many others disliked it here usually when I find something to be terrible Im one of the few. I guess this show was really just that bad. What did it for me was the terrible CGI it competed with s Goosebumps. Along with that the show was just pretty damn boring. Even with that said I thought the first episode of GoT was fairly boring as well and I ended up loving the show after a couple episodes. Im going to try to remain positive here and hope for the same outcome. I just hope that whatever happens Sutter wont allow his wife or his own writing to butcher what was once amazing. Did he really have to include Katey Sagal in this show too? I cant see anything but Gemma with a wig on and it really takes away from the show.,TBX,cv6lo99,3,t5_37m98
