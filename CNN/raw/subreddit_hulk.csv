154149,0,t3_1vu07e,I agree with Kiamodo.  I think it was a decent film and I didnt understand why it was hated on so much.  It went into my favorite part of Hulk comics Banners psyche.  My only gripe is that they called his father David and not Brian.  It kind of felt like a kick to the groin in reference to the old Hulk series.  Well homage it... by naming the villain after the title hero.,hulk,cevzm3q,2,t5_2ty9t
2009110,0,t3_2hqiwx,Future Imperfect was a good story. Originally a  issue I believe it is available as one book. Also Hulk The End which is the last Hulk story. Very good as well.,hulk,ckvamw3,3,t5_2ty9t
3705055,0,t1_cnt8ko4,This storyline starts right at the end of Indestructible Hulk where he gets shot in the back of the head.  Issue  of this series just came out and it started in  it is just called Hulk.,hulk,cqelneu,1,t5_2ty9t
5027119,0,t3_3jn4w9,Is this happening in ?  I really dislike this idea to me the Hulk IS bruce banner the gamma bomb may have allowed Hulk to manifest in ways that never would have otherwise but basically Hulk  Banner..  Taking that away and giving it to someone else seems silly... this isnt Iron Man Armor its the hulk he should be relatively unique etc..  Thats just my preference though.,hulk,curyjb4,1,t5_2ty9t
5802447,0,t1_cxgbty7,You know Im sorry to burden you but Ive actually never read a hulk comic in general. Could you suggest something? I heard Peter David has a good run but Im not sure if thats a good jumping on point,hulk,cxgck5e,2,t5_2ty9t
9573293,0,t3_4m3i1k,The Ang Lee movie is awesome I dont care what anybody says. When I first saw it I was watching a Hulk movie. They treated the character with respect.When I watched the  and other MCU movies I didnt see Hulk fighting I saw some green ape flinging his fists at other people.,hulk,d9t3qqg,2,t5_2ty9t
