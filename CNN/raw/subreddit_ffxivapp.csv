168307,0,t3_1w0kft,I disagree with your complaints about the new UI I actually prefer it.Party and Party ALL are pretty selfexplanatory for me... Party lets you view detailed reports on individual party members while Party ALL gives you a combined view of ALL party members giving you a overview of their performance in any category you wish. Party ALLs DAMAGE TAKEN is super useful as a raid leader.As for bugs as ZireaelStargaze suggested Id encourage you to head over to his github and create a detailed bug report there so that he can fix it. Ive reported bugs before and the dedication with which he handles bug reports amp feature requests is fascinating.,ffxivapp,cexlqcj,1,t5_2zdoc
304210,0,t3_1xkkvy,Do you have some screenshots?The bigger DPS number by active is damage and damge over time combined.The dps below that is damage only as are the totals. You can turn on combined labels which combines damagedamage over time into  and will be listed as comb. total overall damageWhat version are you using as well?The DPS will tick down as long as people keep doing things. If everyone stops then . seconds after the last action the parser will stop. You can then reset it to auto lock it at those values and move it into the dropdown under Current as a history item. I have mine set to reset  seconds after the last damage only which is typically enough time between battles.,ffxivapp,cfcar5a,1,t5_2zdoc

1876300,0,t1_ckf2bcp,I actually havent had a chance to get something built for debugging and testing yet. Ive mostly just been looking over some of the source.So from what youre saying my character information will also come in on the NewPCEntries event? The impression i got was that event was for other PCs around me and only my information would com on the NewPlayerEntity. So my own character will come on both events?,ffxivapp,ckfacnx,1,t5_2zdoc
6792009,0,t1_d0e0b3z,Any chance you were able to find this?  I would be very interested in this plugin.  I believe I have read some threads pertaining to development of it but they seemed to be at the early stages.  I see what you mean about the memory.  I might dig more into that as well.,ffxivapp,d0m5vox,1,t5_2zdoc
10425875,0,t3_5p2unf,No app is allowed per say and according to the ToS.  Just dont talk about applications ingame. Its completely undetectable since SE does not scan your processes like WoW.Ive been using and working on this app since .  That said due to work and family updates Ive had to temporarily leave the game and cant update as fast but Im giving access to trusted deva to update offsets and such.,ffxivapp,dcpub7y,1,t5_2zdoc
