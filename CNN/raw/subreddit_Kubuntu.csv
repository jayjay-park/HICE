7155335,0,t3_4dgobv,Just a quick comment that kubuntu is no longer really a recommended KDE distribution. Beyond the traditional time tried OpenSuSE there are also many others you might want to take a look at.,Kubuntu,d1rhp2p,-1,t5_2qui2

7614794,0,t1_d37qswj,Yeah Neon is neat. It actually works pretty well even though its not supposed to be ready just yet. But that was not my point my question was what the fuck happened to Kubuntu? After  years of smooth sailing shit seems to be hitting the fan for the distro while upstream is doing as good as ever. Did Riddell make all the difference? I find that hard to believe... ,Kubuntu,d37rgd7,1,t5_2qui2
