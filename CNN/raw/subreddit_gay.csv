46672,0,t1_cejqf4h,yes i realize the hypothetical people you are using in your hypothetical example do not exist but if that example is to make any sense you will have to define your terms.So this hypothetical gay man is in the closet and his sum total of homophobia is making gay jokes. Is it right to out him? Nah probably not. Just a few casual jokes wont harm me. The real man gay or not voted to keep our gay armed forces able to be imprisoned in Leavenworth for their existence voted to keep gays OUT of hate crime laws so wed have less protection and voted to allow us to continue to be discriminated against in the workplace.No I dont want him to commit suicide nor to be gay bashed in an alley but if he loses his career and the fancy home and cars harming his fellow gays earned him I for one will not shed one bloody tear.,gay,cejqsw3,4,t5_2qhef
46720,0,t3_1umn59,Aaron Rodgers I feel bad for. His sexuality is his own and no one should be forced out of the closet who isnt in a position of power or legislation to curb or prevent equality rights in the gay community. He also is not vocal or detrimental towards the gay community. Having said that Aaron Schock IS in a position of power and legislation and has a dubious record of voting against gay equality rights. My ONLY hope is that these allegations of his sexuality are true otherwise its just another witch hunt on a gay bigot.

118740,0,t1_cers9vq,I assume for Science so Ill indulge. So a couple years ago I meet this dude. Lets call him Dick. Dick and I have a terrible first time out together with a bunch of my friends. We actually get into a heated discussion that gets me kicked out of the car Im in with him cuz of comments I made about Dick and his boyfriend. End of story right? No. For a few months after that I run into Dick quite frequently at a club Im a regular at. Through a desire to squash the drama between us he starts to try and smooth shit over by being overly friendly towards me. Buying me drinks and approaching me to say hi or dance close to me on the floor. Last June Dick sees me at the club again and this time asks for my number and says we should hang out because youre an awesome guy. Dick is pretty attractive and for being the bigger man and for trying to settle our drama I give him my number. The next weekend I have plans to go party with my roommate in Sacramento for the cities pride weekend and invite Dick along. He agrees but flakes at the last minute. Some shit about work. No big deal. I next invite Dick to a beer crawl that he readily accepts and then flakes on the night before saying his mother is in the hospital for appendicitis. Right on no sweat. I then invite Dick to San Francisco Pride with me and my friends in our hotel room which he says hell show up for but is a no show for. Now Im onto the douche and decide Im through bothering with the asshole. I see fuckface... I mean Dick a couple weeks later at the club and he apologizes profusely for his flaky behavior. He tells me work has been and life has been blah blah blah blah. I tell him whatever no sweat its cool and leave it at that. For the next few months hes all hyped up to hang out still but Im done suggesting shit. So finally last November this fucker... I mean Dick texts me if I want to go see an Envogue concert. I tell Dick that while I appreciate the offer Envogue is not on my list of artists to see in concert. Dick then suggests The Go Gos. Now Im an Eighties dude and while normally Im not into cheesy pop songs I can get into being drunk and cheesy for one night. So I accept Dick even offers to pay for my ticket for being such a flake before. I think awesome! The night of December th rolls around and Dick shows up at my house. I tell him Ill drive since he bought the tickets. We go grab a bite to eat at a pretty nice restaurant have a pretty good conversation getting to really know each other and I pick up the tab. I get us to the venue and heres where shit goes down. We get inside I buy our first round of drinks were talking chilling enjoying the interior of the venue and the concert starts. Pretty packed standing room only house. About two songs in I notice Dick is gone. Right on probably went to the john or maybe to get the next round of drinks. Couple more songs fucker... I mean Dick is no where to be seen. WTF?!?! So I stay put on the chance hes lost and will eventually find me. Nope thats not working so I go searching for him. Impossibly stupid because its dark crowded and just too many people. By this time the buzz from the alcohol is wearing off so I go get another drink. BTW outside of maybe  songs total I hate the Go Gos music. This is not my scene anyway. So Im there alone listening to bullshit Eighties pop and drinking waaaay overpriced watered down Long Islands and shots of Jameson. My nightmare. Anyway concert ends finally and lights come on and still no Dick in sight so I make my way to the entrance. Still no Dick. I wait and wait and wait. BTW I textd him about  times during the concert letting him know where I was. Im now texting and calling his phone which goes straight to voicemail. No response. I leave a final text and voicemail that if he wants a ride home he should get in touch with me in the next ten minutes. I walk back to my car. I get in and sit listening to some real music to calm myself down. I figure its going to be a long ride home with this Dick. After ten minutes I try his phone again and give him five more minutes. I finally head out for home. I wake up the next morning and check to see if his car is still outside my place. Its gone. Great! I havent had any interaction with Dick since then. I havent made it back to the club I see him at for various reasons but its going to be epic when I do. I dont plan on holding back on what I have to say but at least I dodged the bullet of fucking crazy. So Im done with men....,gay,ceryah9,5,t5_2qhef

Look at your diet what you do etc. As for looking ugly I cant say for sure that you are ugly but have you considered maybe changing your hairstyle? Getting a new wardrobe?Personally I am of the opinion that there are no people outside of those with genetic deformations etc who are inherently ugly. While there are people who havent found what makes them look good yet there arent inherently ugly people. All I can say from what youve said is that what youre doing now isnt workingso try to change it. You dont have to do it all at once and uproot your entire life.

Life is too short for people to obscure your happiness.Now for the obligatory warning If you genuinely feel that you might not be safe somewhere you and your BF should be aware of the surroundings and make an educated choice on whether or not to kiss or be affectionate otherwise.Sadly people can get violent. Im not sure if people in your town will be or could be that level but safety is always key.Anyways love life and love your BF. Hes a cutie! You both are,gay,cewmmzx,6,t5_2qhef

517407,0,t1_cfyw8ve,Testing for viral RNA is expensive. Like. Very expensive. The equipment needed for them might not even be locally available and it might not be offered as available for routine testing anyway. Thats why antibody tests are used instead so far as I understand it.To the OP no your previous results are not invalidated by todays test results. Hes just warning you that todays test does not mean that you arent currently positive it only means that your body is not producing antibodies against the virus and that to do so can take a few months.So you might shorthand this by saying that todays test tells you about your status as of three months ago.We all know that barebacking happens none of us would be here if it didnt but if youre worried about it just use a damn condom. Its not difficult. What the counselor was wisely doing was warning you against thinking that this test told you something it did not. It is perfectly true about the window period so take that into account in your relationships.As for the counselors personal demeanor toward you just find a different counselor if youre not comfortable talking to that person. You dont owe them anything. Theyre there to provide the service. Theyre employees. Youre responsible for your own behavior though. Just because you felt that someone was judging you for your behavior doesnt mean that you get to go skipping off pretending that todays negative result means you get to do whatever you want and nothing bad can happen because worst case scenario youre positive and the test just didnt pick it up today.If youre not comfortable with the potential consequences of your behavior you dont have a right to come on reddit to complain about the bare facts when theyre presented to you.Thats not being rude. Thats just truth. Deal with it.,gay,cfz301j,2,t5_2qhef

950613,0,t3_24zy2c,Its a situation in which the majority will be apathetic to making the distinction but neither term alone applies to  of the people that will be labeled by either.  In America especially but perhaps abroad as well weve become obsessed with labels but as labels become more specific those that adhere to such a system have to put more effort into their interactions with their peers that exist in more and more extraneously labelled groups.  Ive also known people to use the terms homo and biromantic in lieu of homoamorous  I would say that I am a biromantic homosexual man.  While the terms do address what should be wellingrained but isnt in modern society  the fact that queer folk do indeed have the capacity to love and do not exist solely as pornographic sexual deviants  they create the new complexity of forcing the straight masses to really examine themselves in terms of sexuality and amorous attraction or forcing them to distinguish between the two.  Its not that they arent able or even consciously unwilling but the most likely reaction will be to resist at all costs because change is slow...

He didnt think this date went well and he doesnt have the cojones to say that to your face or hes not sure what he wants to happen next and he needs time to think and doesnt want to rush into anything.Ill be honest with you...It sounds like the former because youve been on one date and you already sound clingier than saran wrap.

1377951,0,t3_29vt9n,What youll run into instead unfortunately is another trope.  Yes gay movies are largely either everybody is sad cuz AIDS or coming out story of rejected gay teen but if youre looking at gay RomComs youll be faced with very attractive middle class white man who is far too picky for his own good cant find love even thoughbecause he lives in NYC LA SFC ampc..  Best you can do is find a few movies that make this process bearable.One of my favourite gay sex scenes in a movie is in The Mostly Unfabulous Social Life of Ethan Green  Not for being hot but for being hilarious.  Wonderful depiction of what sex looks like between couples whove lost their spark yes body fascism is ze ballz I do agree but so is the notion that all sex is hot porn sex.  The movie is very tropey but mostly in that it makes fun of them and reiterates again and again that gay men arent actually like that.  Based on a comic of moreorless the same name.Im oddly fond of Is It Just Me? which is about a guy who is totally adorable and very cute but in a geeky sort of a way and not in a perfect sort of a way.  The kind of guy who in a perfect world would be a catch but because hes the wrong kind of attractive i.e. cute not hot cute cant seem to land a date.  Then he meets a sexy cowboy whos into him but he doesnt believe it and hijinx ensue.  Bonus points for the cowboys best gay friend being over  and yet is not treated like a sexual predator or some kind of a pathetic walking corpse.Probably the best gay thing Ive ever seen is The Outs the whole series can be watch here which is sort of a gay relationship whodunnit.  Basically in the first episode our two main characters are established as being ex boyfriends of a formerly toxic relationship.  Were not sure why it was toxic why they broke up nothing.  None of that sitcom crap where they list out for the audience exactly who did what when all we know is that one tells the other that hes poison.  Only by episode  out of plus a very special The Meaning of Hanukkah bonus episode do we finally get  answers.  The show was artful and slow moving but not in a boring way more like the narrator is happy to take his time to establish a narrative and set an appropriate mood sort of a slow moving.If you want something completely different like... waaaay different then I finally suggest Welcome to Nightvale listen here among other places.  Its a radio showstyle podcast and its sort of like if the War of the Worlds broadcast took place in a city where both the Cthulu Mythos and also Raccoon City were buried under the sands.  The gay part is that the host of Nightvale Community Radio Cecil Baldwin is a gay man that is the character is gay and this fact rarely comes up.  Not in a closeted way but more like in a why is the man who reports the traffic talking about being gay all of the time? sort of a doesnt come up often.  When it does come up its either super subtle or in the form of him gushing about Carlos the new scientist in town whos obsessed with time.  Perfect Carlos.  Anyway... do not start with the newest episode the mayoral election between Hiram McDaniels a fiveheaded dragon who was once arrested for insurance fraud and The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives In Your Home is coming up an without context it will make no sense.  Also kitties!Oh!  Actually one more Cthulu  Obviously it involves the Cthulu mythos.  The usual stuff some gotham horror we never actually see but is probably the evil frog men i.e. the Deep Ones from Innsmouth are slowly taking possession of a coastal village and one unsuspecting hero must either end the curse go mad or both.  Just for fun the hero this time around is a gay man.  Pretty neat eh?  Geek culture gothic horror and a gay main character?  Good lord!  What next!?I say the weird ones above because the usual suspects like Broken Hearts Club or Love! Valour! Compassion! or the ultra ultra classic Torchsong Trilogy are just about guaranteed to be mentioned.  Also Im a fan of alternative media.,gay,cip0ftk,19,t5_2qhef

1821334,0,t1_ck7rmkq,Interesting response. I usually have a hard time understanding this viewpoint because being gay is my raison detre now. But I can almost understand it from your response.What kind of environment did you grow up in? Maybe I did arbitrarily decide it was going to be a big part of my life by steeping myself in gay books and movies but I was trying to fill a void to get rid of my ignorance.What kind of environment do you live in? It might not be a big deal everywhere but it seems like it would be some kind of a deal in most places. Maybe you just have more courage than me...Insofar as I have any goals left they have to do with gay stuff. I want to give representation to everything that was missing in my early life that wasnt said. Not for others benefit necessarily or entirely Im still trying to fill the void for myself to understand.But maybe just having a partner and being open would be enough. After a while it would become no big deal.I do think Im scapegoating my homosexuality artificially isolating it and making it a catchall for my problems. I think its an inextricable part of myself though. Any one aspect of a person becomes artificial when viewed in isolation or at least not the whole picture. Maybe the answer is just to live with it more and openly and let it become more unconscious and interwoven.TLDR To use a Smiths lyric I feel like the boy with a thorn in his side. ,gay,ck8noxw,1,t5_2qhef

1856938,0,t3_2fkzpu,Eh I started having sex with other guys a few months before I turned .  Trust me buddy number  it isnt that there arent gay guys at your school its that none of them are out of the closet and number  annoying as hell but if youre looking to hookup with someone your own age its easier to do so when you are in the closet which is NOT an endorsement for staying in the closet.  Reality is that in the right situation at your age almost any guy will give it a shot just to get his rocks off if hes horny enough.I would first of all encourage you to check and see if theres a gay youth center where you live youd be really amazed some of the places they exist.  There are also things like gay bowling and gay roller skating essentially chill stuff to meet other queer folk.  There might be like a pink prom or other dances for lgbt youth where you live without knowing too much about where youre located its hard to say or do any research.  If youre out to your folks you might talk them into letting you go to a gay summer camp you wont get laid probably but youll make some other gay friends.  I would also encourage you to look into the age of consent laws in your state.  Some states so long as both are minors with  years of each other its fine in others it is literally illegal for a minor to masturbate.  You really have to know the laws of where you live and find out what you can and can not get in trouble for.  Personally Id be far less worried about stds you dont have to be a genius to know how to use a condom or to make sure the guy giving you a blowjob doesnt have herpes but there are some scary psychos out there youve got to be careful of.  The ideal situation would be if your parents knew you were gay and were cool with you having sex so long as you were in your room with someone age appropriate whose parents also knew and were cool with it and you were playing safe ie. condoms or testing and monogamy.  Sadly people have gotten more conservative about that sort of thing instead of less.,gay,ckcyfjb,2,t5_2qhef

1895566,0,t3_2gap3v,First of all cute disclaimer at the beginning. Do not be afraid about what others might think or say if it affects you its important.Personal experience I started feeling attracted to the same sex when I was  and coming to terms with it took me around  years. I had a strong catholic formation at the time Im an atheist now and coming to terms meant defying what Ive learned and believed for a long time being afraid my friends would change the way they acted around me getting labeled. It was overwhelming at the time. Damn this will be longer than expected.So in the beginning I said to myself I was bisexual. Why? From what I can recall because of the fear of being labeled as queer Nothing wrong with it just recalling my feelings at the time. As the time passed I noticed I was only attracted to boys and calling myself bisexual was to feel less gay. Getting involved with more gay people from an Internet forum was a big help for throwing away my prejudices about the gay community. It took me a while to accept me. The fear of being judged confronted or questioned because of my sexuality made me kept that part hidden. At some point I was living kind of a double life avoiding questions related to dating or using genderless words like Im dating this person.... It required a lot of effort and there was a moment when I realized I couldnt keep living that way not being able to exprees with complete freedom or showing who I was. Once I realized that I decided to start coming out with my friends. One of the lessons I learned when coming out was that it could have been way sooner. Most of my friends answered with Why didnt you tell me before?.  Also I wasted a lot of time waiting for the right moment. Theres no such thing. The best moment is the present.Finally through life youll find lots of people with prejudices about anything not only being gay. They can disapprove the way you look the way you dress what you like  from music to movies to activities but that means nothing uless you make it relevant. What Im trying to say is there will be assholes through your life wether you come out as gay or not. Accepting who you are and what you like helps and improves a lot the process of meeting people with the same interests. Dont give up and enjoy life! It has its ups and downs but at the end its worth living it.Hope this can help D ,gay,ckhltvo,1,t5_2qhef

She also sounds nice and may want to take things further.I think you should decide what you want.Im more sexually attracted to guys. But Ive been with girls to and while the Vs just alright my opinion I still had fun. Beyond sexual attraction theres emotional. For example theres this guy Ive really grown close to and while weve had great sex I dont need it to spend a romantic night together. It can be about so much more.Ive also had sex with a good friend before and while it changes things its also just sex and you can still be great friends even if you decide not to do it again. Just dont force something if you dont both want it. Communication is important and it sounds like two have that. What Im trying to say is that you can have whatever relationship you want as long as its mutual. If you really like her just give it a try  you dont have to have sex.

And depending on his reaction you afterwards might want to tell him about your crush on him  or perhaps you dont want to but that depends on his reaction.

2344534,0,t3_2m5r77,I can see her point but shes stepping up to the plate with precisely the same kind of generalizing and accusations that both feminists and gay rights activists are against.In my personal view feminism and gay rights actually are very nearly the same issue as I tend to view homophobia as being blatantly sexist you cant date this person because your genitals match is not wholly unlike you cant have this jobmoneyopinion because your genitals are of the wrong configuration.  Honestly I do feel that the gay community should in general be taking stands against misogyny nearly as often as against homophobia as progress on each front inevitably helps the other.I would based on this articlerate this woman as being rather far from actually being a feminist however.  Feminism is all about gender equality and she mostly seems concerned that people arent talking about the same things as she is and that simply isnt going to happen all the time.  There are always issues to discuss along many different political fronts she finds the most important ones for her are the issues relating to gender discrimination and many homosexuals may find the issues relating to gay rights more important to them.  This doesnt mean homosexuals dont support feminism and it especially doesnt mean that broad and surprisingly bigoted generalizations about gays only wanting to lounge around mostly naked and doing drugs are in any way correct or even okay.I identified as a feminist before I even knew I was gay.  I strive daily to  identify and criticize misogyny wherever it may be even if it turns out it was something socially conditioned into me which I must work to get rid of.  I love women though obviously not sexually and want little more than for women to finally be legally politically socially and professionally equal to men.  To have a selfproclaimed feminist of a celebrity claim that I would prefer to be high in a pool than to see equal rights for everyone is incredibly insulting and hurtful.TLDR As a gay man who has always identified as a feminist I take great offense to this statement and get the feeling that this woman cares more about people agreeing with her than she actually does about gender equality.  I do however feel that the gay community should participate more in the fight against misogyny.Edit Left an important point out of the TLDR.,gay,cm1hva8,1,t5_2qhef

2482254,0,t1_cmgjrp1,Hello!I think everyone closeted gayatheistetc can identify with your fears of being outed not fitting in and catching flak for being different. I think what pushed me into coming out was wanting to date someone and not having to hide it from those important to me.You will be surprised at how how open minded and accepting even those friends making the gay jokes are. I deliberately avoided telling a good friend of mine for awhile because he made some joke about how we should just sew up all gay guys assholes. When I finally came out to him he had no recollection of even making the joke and said he was completely fine with it.  I think a lot of guys make gay jokes just because they like to make jokes and they dont think they are offending anyone present not because they hate the gays.The thing is these guys already know and respect you and finding out you are gay wont change most of their minds. You will be exposing your vulnerability to those you tell and it will most likely make you closer to them. That is based on my experience but I purposely dont associate with the machofootball crowd. So it could also blow up in your face. That really is for you to feel out. The question you have to ask yourself is Do I want to keep living with this facade just to maintain these friends? You could also wait until closer to the end of your contract. The first group I came out to was in summer camp. I knew if it went poorly I would never have to see them again in a month or so.Just remember some people are assholes but I think most people will pleasantly surprise you.  Ignore the assholes and befriend everyone else.,gay,cmikhr6,1,t5_2qhef

2548558,0,t3_2ovu5h,I guess Im lost on this. I absolutely think it is more difficult being gay and being a more visible minority. People tend to have fairly defined ideas of the types of people to whom they are attracted and race is certainly a factor just like weight height eye color... Does that make it racist? I suppose it depends. If one is simply not attracted to Asian folks to use a very broad category Im not sure that is particularly racist. That to me is a little like accusing one of any number of different ists and isms based on personal preference. Dont like older guys? You are an ageist. Dont like skinny guys? Sizeist. Rich people? Classist. It could go on endlessly and while I wont pretend to suggest ageism is as bad as racism in society there are plenty of more dogmatic people who certainly would.To me the line between racism and preferences is the reason behind the preference if one doesnt like Mexican guys because standard ridiculous racist thing here that goes beyond preferences. It speaks to intentions. If instead its a more nebulous expression of what one tends to know one likes then I think that is more a preference thing. ,gay,cmr8f70,5,t5_2qhef

2914373,0,t1_cnzb6z8,Eh I wouldnt say its being young and immature and more has to do with whatever event in his life made him such a stickler when it comes to finances.    I grew up in a very poor family as in my parents would sometimes go without eating just so me and my brother could. Later my dad landed an amazing job which afforded us the ability to move to another town a nicer home and I had a very good remaining childhood. Then I saw my mother quit work after an injury start using drugs and rack up k in credit card debt while my father worked  days a week  hours a day.    Im a huge stickler when it comes to money but me and my boyfriend take turns paying for things. We both make about the same amount of money but we dont care in terms of amounts and sometimes one of us forgets our wallet. No big deal. Weve only been together  months.    My last relationship went on for  years and he literally made  money for over a year he refused to get a parttime job while in Cosmetology School and I supported him and busted my ass and he constantly complained about my not wanting to go out to eat every night of the week or not wanting to take trips because it was my money. And it was my money. Call me immature and young but I was not happy that he refused to get a parttime job. I was going to school and working fulltime and all he did was go to school parttime.    Now granted I do agree that the other person needs to realize that money is not equal in terms of amount and a percentage is more fair. That is a red flag that hes not willing to compromise on this issue but I say sit down and talk to him over dinner about it one night.    It could be his albeit hes going about it the wrong way attempt at trying to push his SO to maybe find a better paying job so they can both have nicer things without actually saying Sweetheart you have a shitty job. Find a better one.    I think labeling them as being young and immature or that they have a sense of entitlement to his own money Uhm to an extent dont most of us? is a bit much.

3309652,0,t1_cp5egen,This is the solution that works for my boyfriend and I. Also isnt viagra available over the counter? Drugs are not the answer but it might help stimulate things. Just because he goes soft doesnt translate to hes not into you or that hes not having a good time. Sometimes the pressure to please outweighs the pleasure itself since he can see its important to you. Talking about it will help but even more so perhaps suggesting sexual situations outside of anal and indulging those fantasies too.,gay,cp5j0b1,4,t5_2qhef

3353560,0,t3_2yk38p,I had a very similar struggle. My family werent horridly homophobic but still had alot of passing comments from my sisters and parents about the gays and those fags it was ingrained my head that gay wasnt right I was always told oh when you grow up and get married and have kids..... This consistent enforcement of heteronormativity really threw me under the bus when I started watching gay porn as a teen. I felt messed up confused and had a constant battle with myself on whether I was a good or bad personall for just liking the same sex. It caused me to delve into a deep depression.This kept happening until I met a lesbian woman over an online video game who discussed with me her life and how if i just pull through until i left the toxic environment I was in I would be ok.She was lovely enough to even invite me to live with her and her partner after I finished high school in the city. This changed me forever the ability to be free from it all to do what I wanted and to see a healthy thriving gay couple first hand really gave me courage to accept who I was.Ive been out for  years and honestly I love it. I dont think I could picture my life any other way. I have a happy life more then I could say when i thought I was straight. Also one of my favourite parts about being in the LGBTIQ community is that although many people are rejected by their own families we build our own families we choose the people in our lives that make us better. Its hard to accept now it may be hard in the future but being gay isnt a death sentence its an opportunity to see the world in a different perspective.,gay,cpaj3w7,7,t5_2qhef
3355479,0,t3_2yk38p,gt  I want to find love with a person who will bare my children...Reproduction is arguably the most fundamental part of our existence and growing old with a partner that you cant even reproduce with just seems so... pointless... Not every woman can bear children.  And not every man can make a woman pregnant.  Even if you were straight the odds of you being fertile she being fertile and you spending the rest of your life with her are very very slim.  Reproduction is not as necessary as it once was.  There are  billion people on this planet currently.  The population isnt reliant on most people reproducing for the survival of the species currently.Gay men and women can find a person to love to raise a child adopted or surrogate with and to spend the rest of their life with.  You are harping on a very small part of the idealized relationship you are harping on how a child is created.  There are so many children that were accidents that were unwanted and given up.  What is wrong about giving one of those children a loving home with a person of either gender that you love?gt  What did I ever do to deserve such a shit lifestyle?You havent lived a gay lifestyle yet. You are closeted and in a homophobic environment.  You havent had a chance to see what type of life you will have as an out gay man that has a bf and some friends that love you for you not for who you love.gt  Its just so fucking unfair.Guess what?  Life isnt fair.  You have to deal with the cards that you have been dealt,gay,cpaqzd1,6,t5_2qhef

You left out the confusing especially that part that left the relationship between the two clauses unclear.Also the fact that you and your partner apparently both agreed that there was a significant enough difference between seventeen and eighteen to merit lying about it is baffling and actually laughably pathetic. Did you think  was just a touch too close to  or... What? I literally dont understand what purpose that lie served.

Thats my advice. If you want to be exclusive and move forward with the relationship in the ways you seem to want to ask if he feels the same way. I waited for my boyfriend which left him to his vices when we could have begun being just us officially a lot sooner. If youre fine letting him take the reins though waiting for him to decide he is ready be prepared. I never thought my boyfriend would tell me he had slept with his ex. He had talked about him a lot about everything he put my boyfriend through. But at the end of the day shit happens people are people and people make mistakes. Not that I think what my boyfriend did was a mistake but he certainly does. He was is ashamed he had gone back to this guy that was awful to him. He had been with his ex for nearly eight years and was cheated on and lied to about it and lots of other things in their relationship. You say that he seems distant somehow and thats exactly how I felt.  It might be nothing like this in your situation but I just thought Id provide my experience. Honesty is essential to a relationship new or old so be honest about how you are feeling and what you want where you want to go and what your concerns are. Good luck.P.S.  My boyfriend and I have been together for seven months now and it is truly great.,gay,cuycoqz,1,t5_2qhef

People that hide in the closet deny themselves and their friendsfamily the truth of their lives.  Ultimately I think they are missing out but it some ways we all pay.However it could be really bad with them.

6001835,0,t3_3xoaut,Although it is undeniable that you will be able to interact with gay people more if you were to spend more time hanging out with the people from the community you shouldnt think that you have to neglect your straight friends in order to find love.We are living in an era where even straight people are open with the idea of homosexuality and we should be grateful about it. Having a Boyfriendwanting to find a Boyfriend doesnt necessary mean you have to stop hanging out with your straight friends it only means that you will have another circle of gay friends rather than just the straight ones.Perhaps being single and lonely during the holiday season is why you are feeling a little down. Dont feel bad and dont give up if you  keep your heads up and keep your hope there one day your dream will definitely come true. If you think about it straight people arent having a lot better than us nowadays. How many of your friends are also still roaming on Tinder? How many of them are actually single right now during the holiday season? Relationship takes effort a gay one takes a bit more effort but in the end its all going to worth it Keep your chin up and dont feel bad. Have a positive attitude towards life then great things will happen to you I promise.Good luck ,gay,cy6dd1q,7,t5_2qhef

6148958,0,t3_3zs0co,gt Why are guys obsessed with sports? Brojobs mainly.gt Why do they care about girls so much?Mother complex.Okay my turn.  Why dont you people who ask on a daily basis am I gay? ever talk to each other?  I respond to a bunch of these posts tryna help a brotha out but would some of you please stick around and talk to each other a bit?  I think most of you want to hear from each other anyway not me.  Really.  You dont have to know anything to talk to people.  Trust me.Spiel  Most people are capable of enjoying a lot of stuff sexually.  Humans are pretty fucking sexual but that should come as no surprise since the rest of the animal kingdom is basically the same way.  But we also have this thing where we try to grain power and credibility through claiming to be less baseinstinct driven more ecclesiastical edit   than other people.  So really the Spanish Inquisition ruined sex and sexuality for all of us except those of us who love kids and hate sex.Slightly more seriously abridged  Humans dont come in three flavors gay straight and bi.  Were each attracted to a whole mess of things physical size physical features personality sense of humor power dynamics sense of irony physique earlobes kindness strength etc etc that vaguely overlap with gender sometimes.  All you can do is date experiment explore be open minded and eventually when you have a better idea of how you actually work you can pick some shitty label that doesnt really communicate much anyway.Now heres my entire very last post in its entirety already too long cut and paste.  Would you people please talk to each other?  Seriously you might get laid.Being open minded about yourself is the first step and youre doing well there. Continue to be open to experiences and people. Up to you but some people do well when they just let themselves go wild a bit when theyre younger and explore. Other people have less urge to explore. Depends on you. Please remember gay bi straight are not each one thing. No two straight people are exactly alike. Same for no two gay people. Theyre interested in all sorts of power dynamics body types sex acts types of relationships or the lack of etc. As humans theres no one set of physical features that does it for us.Clubs are boring alone IMO but can be fun with friends. Thats something to be open to  not for everyone. LGBT meetups gaymers hiking etc can be a great way to make friends and friends of friends. Get invited to parties. One of the best parts of being LGBT is meeting more interesting people who have interesting perspectives and have taken their life unusual directions. Soak it up.If youre feeling brave and I really hope you are have a bit of fun with casually gently flirting with people of the same sex. Most people like it when someone takes an interest in their life their desires likes hopes accomplishments etc. Do it without being an entitled twit and dumping demands and expectations on them and most guys appreciate the attention. Dont even think or worry about more happening just have fun appreciating both the men and women around you. Maybe something will happen if you both want it to but dont get psyched out worrying about it.Its okay to be inexperienced and wanting to take things slow. Its okay to want to know people better before hooking up and its okay to have anonymous nostrings hookups. You know yourself better than anyone so just communicate where youre at and what youre looking for. Dont make time for anyone who doesnt respect that  that only leads to shitty feelings. Above all else sex dating and sexuality should be fun or else youre doing it wrong.Good luck!,gay,cyokluj,2,t5_2qhef

6236510,0,t3_40ptud,Well you cant change whom you are.  Neither should you.  Most of your social issues are directly related to your restricted sexuality.  You are now a grownup and are allowed to live wherever you like with whomever you like behave however you please and dress in whatever clothes suit you best.  You are gay you lucky bunny !  You can spend every cent you earn on yourself.  No ghastly anklebiters to bring up school fees or family holidays to finance.  You will be able to buy a better house than the straights have a better sex life and change partners without an expensive divorce !  Anyone who cant be your friend if you tell them you are gay never was a proper friend in the first place.  Families with ludicrous religious beliefs need a darned good kick in the pants by confronting a bit of reality on their own doorstep.  Us gay people dont reproduce.... we are are the sons and daughters of straight people made in Gods image just like they were.  We dont choose to be gay !  How much easier it would be if we could !  No we fulfil a place in Gods plan if plan there is as much as anyone else.  You need to get yourself an independent income however you can even serving McDonalds if you must and cut your ties with home.  You can still visit but not live there.  Being shy is another way of saying you are a bit afraid of certain things.  Talking to strangers.  Saying your mind.  Letting go enough to make new friends.  These are all very common problems for all sorts of people.  When you go shopping and interact with the shop assistants and cashiers practice looking them in the face and use eye contact.  They are total strangers whom you will never see again most likely so no harm done if it all goes to cock the first few times !  If you go to community meetings collage religious gatherings etc places where speaking out is encouraged stand up and do so Im sure you have an opinion or a question inside your head.  It doesnt matter what the reply is its just practice to give yourself confidence.  Once you have these qualities and they are far easier to get than youll ever believe finding genuine friends being yourself as an openly gay man will just flow forth naturally.  This does come over rather like some sort of rally call but its only meant to try and guide you forwards to the next big step in life.  One thing an old codger like me is qualified to tell you is this  Life never stays the same.  Sometimes things get worse often they get better but never do they remain the same.  Now go and start enjoying your life.  You only got the one.  Its all yours and yours alone so dont waste it !,gay,cyyiuvy,2,t5_2qhef

6364695,0,t1_czd2v7o,For my major Im studying Creative Writing I love to read and always liked coming up with characters and worlds to place them in. Id like to get a career in publishing and eventually writing itself. Id like to live somewhere warm since I currently live in the uppermidwest Wisconsin and I dont like the cold.I guess my biggest issue is that I was once around my junior year of high school thinner and a lot more confident because of it. It was around the time I first came out and I wanted to flaunt my sexuality I guess. It was no big secret that I was gay since the community was so closenit and small. Problem was that the pressure from flaunting it made me collapse and I began to overeat to deal with it. My peers attitudes and my parents passiveaggressive commits took their tole. This lead into a whole stream of issues that Id rather not talk about but there was a lot of selfhate.College has repaired some of the damage being so far from home helps and the more liberal mindset of the students helps. I wanted to get involved with the LGBT community here but they turned out to be a very cliquey based group and I found very little friends.So basically Im comparing how I was to how I am. Its the primary cause for my issues. I keep thinking that to be happy I need to go back to that version of myself. I try to forget it but its a pretty reoccurring thought.,gay,czd3g9b,1,t5_2qhef

The media tells us about Muslims in an awful light in every way and form hardly anything positive and when it is positive its never overplayed. e.g if a Muslim man woman does a crime its put on the fact theyre Muslim and this part is HEAVILY overplayed. When its a white man e.g. Jimmy saville nothing is said about his ethnicity religion and it isnt the primary reason for this bad thing happening  its sad. RACE AND ETHNICITY  SHOULDNT BE THE MAIN REASON  but it is for ethnic groups outside of white  you ever think why  in addition  for that fact that if you are Muslim and in a gay community you will either be disowned  ostracized or killed depending where your from not all but the majority.  You could argue this is the same for white people other ethnicities  Of which it probably is on some parts but the media seems to be only focusing on Muslims as Muslims not as regular people increasing the gap between us and them  people start to look at them as different kind of peopleof which to some people would reinforce the idea of them being unattractive. by that i mean like im not gonna lie but muslims are muslims chrsitans are christians black people are black people  and my brothas are black and white and from Beijing.  but they are people  and noone should deserve to  feel like shit for actions that arent their own       By that i mean media focusing on muslims as the root of all terror attacks  i mean If you hear bad things about someone all the time your not gonna wanna be with them or do anything with them and the media is doing this to muslims.  in addition to the killings also because the portion size of gay muslims and the amount of shit that is happening to them if anything it upscales the sympathy because of the ones that are trying to live their life honestly look at the shit thats happening to them.  by all that i mean the media plays a huge part on segregating  everyday Muslims from the rest of the world. uneducated people are going to be like eurgh sick  bad people and that in essence  reinforcing the distance between muslims and everyone else this ripples through everything not just dating working making friends with them common interactions with people. IT AFFECTS EVERY PART OF THEIR LIFE in a negative way.  I mean when people see disabled some people they feel bad for them sorry for them and everyday actions for non disabled are suddenly cute when its a disabled person. its about changing that negative thought process and viewing people as equals. If you want to  look at the story of neil baldwin hopefully you can gain some insight. Racism is well and alive today and although in the world we live in noone practices  slavery as they did back in the daydefinitely debatable racism is still alive. If you can come across a gay brotha  who treats people as equals non judgemental and against racism  and by that i dont mean a non racist who does nothing to fight against it i mean someone whos taking a stand  youll see with them that they wont say that its unfair in  either terms. By that i mean unfair as in i want that attention or unfair as in they dont deserve that much attention because IT IS A REAL PROBLEM and it affects their  entire life. i may be ranting but for people who live in abusive homes   people feel bad for them and are like you should leave himher why be in that situation. they could end up leaving and life could start to get better although they will have been affected by whatever  shit happened to them alot will start to move on with their life not saying that its without difficulty. But for Muslims in the gay community there is no leaving that oppression because that oppression is the media who are basically implanting ideas into people and uneducated people acting like sheep. On a serious note though i never thought i would actually say this and be one of those guys who is actually saying this but when  it makes perfect sense. They have to learn to live with it for the rest of their lives and it doesnt really make it easier when you see that other people are finding a way out of their situation no hate btw only love  purely example but say with phillipine people im not sure about the issues in relation to being gay i cant help but assume its the same as regular issues gay people face but if a Philippine person commits a crime you wont get people saying oh them Philippine dirty bunch. This is because the media doesnt portray them as that and the individual has no stereotypical unbiased ideas about them.  Where as with Muslims  uneducated people have a bias towards them and its sad this is why im against Racism and fight against it and Homophobia and everything else i believe in. This is why i LOVE the gay community because the majority fight against Homophobia  we do it in the flashiest way too  and are working for a better life for themselves and those around them.  In essence that can be applied to Muslims but its hard to do that when they feel like the whole world is against them and the majority of support is from their own. If anything this should be relatable to.  this is why i will always show my support and stand against racism  and fight for what is right not some crazy ass belief thats being misguided. the attention is more than needed theyre being constantly bullied and have it much worse than others Say  people can have money people can barely have money and you get those living in poverty.  Think of it in those terms if anything you should be thinking about how to fight against this and racism because sooooo many factors play into it and im only brushing the mainobvious issues. Like im at  and at  uni and i literally could write an essay to you here and now but its . am and im tired hence all the punctuation mistakes but Just think about yeh . I guess what im saying is that if your looking  to understand you gotta research your history and see how past decisions inform the life and world we live in today. If your looking to blame someone look at the Media and look at Yourself.,gay,czddlpc,1,t5_2qhef

Rather than either looking for Mr Right or not looking for Mr Right think about it in terms of using these dating experiences to figure out what you are looking for in a man. It will help to take the stress off those first dates and will prevent you from falling for the wrong guy out of desperation.Also in regards to the body thing... Personally I think everyone should work out. Not because of body image but because there are seemingly infinite positive reasons to do it and theres pretty much zero downside. You just need to find what you enjoy. And forget about cutting calories especially to . Youre a young male. If I was your age again Id be hitting the weights big time with a focus on strength as opposed to muscle growth and eating like a madman! At  if youre exercising youre going to have to eat a shitload to gain weight. Dont cut calories just make sure youre getting most of them from the right places i.e. meat and vegetables and avoid sugar.

But in ninth grade after a disastrous relationship with a girl I realized I might just have to accept my homosexuality. During tenth grade I started meeting up with men on Grindr and Tinder and never looked back.Still deeply closeted however but I am in a much better position now than I was  years ago as I know personally accept that I like boys and simply cant have a romantic relationship with girls.PS I was raised by homophobic parents in a environment where everybody assumed I was straight and always talked to me how I was going to meet the perfect girl and we will get married in a church and I will have a big family,gay,d2x8e3b,1,t5_2qhef

Im not afraid to defend myself if I have to but I never insult or belittle someone. As for bisexual men the main problem gays have with them is that they feel theyll just use us for sex but never want anything serious at least not with a guy. And the sad thing is that a lot of bisexual men indulge this. Ill have sex with a guy but Id rather date a woman longterm. and you hear the same from some bisexual girls Ill have sex with a girl but will marry a guy in the longrun. Thats the thing that terrifies gay people. But I know not all bisexual people are the same.,gay,d35jqvk,1,t5_2qhef

Also if you do decide to stay with her it would make sense to tell her you are sexually attracted to guys but you have to let her know that that doesnt mean you are going to leave her.

I only ask because if you arent you could do some serious damage if you did this to someone who wanted to flirt back. Im openly gay so Im fine with it but not everyone is.I feel like this would shut them down pretty quick. How can they respond? No matter what they either unintentionally make themselves seem actually gay or they try to out you someone who is already out. A viable alternative is that you just continue to play along without ever acting on any of their flirting. As you put it you get a free show and in the end theyll realize they just hardcore came onto a guy with zero results. No matter what you win as long as you dont fall for it.Either way trust your friend. Dont pursue these guys that are teasing you and if you do try to pursue the original guy do so defensively until you have proof hes being genuine in his feelings.,gay,d3ggowe,18,t5_2qhef

Not letting me go out with friends as often because they didnt want me to live the homosexual lifestyle. My mom seemed to calm down but was two faced about it by talking shit about it to her friends when she thought I couldnt hear her. My dad was low key about the whole thing. He didnt want their friends in the church to know conservative Christians so I dated guys in secret. Eventually I fell in love with someone and decided to take the big step of making it official. Fast forward to now. They are letting me go on dates and they have even met my boyfriend now. It will get easier.

But the love were being shown is a sign of progress. People coming to our support so rapidly and readily and defending us against those riding the wave of intolerance is progress. Tragedies are an opportunity to see growth and continue to grow and the growth we can see right now is that were more loved and accepted by the world than we ever have been even despite a bunch of idiots that try to prove otherwise.

Whether he ever slept with anyone doesnt speak to an internal struggle. I guess I see where yall are coming from. A guy who goes to gay clubs but never picks up may necessarily be gay. Speaking from what Id read though he definitely seemed disenfranchised. Though not well informed. In his police call he reportedly claimed allegiance to a couple militant radical Islam groups who definitely despise each other. So the media painted a picture of someone who couldnt really reconcile his internal struggle of homosexuality with some semblance of radical religion.

I understand it comes with the territory but even if its a hookup app I still want a person who can speak rationally.  Like if were arranging to go to a movie together dont say you want to suck me off in the public theater.

8868646,0,t1_d7du6ty,TBH I and science dont support the notion that these characteristics are innate.  On the contrary they seem to be strongly affected by environmental and personal factors.Also knowing when someone is gay has nothing to do with femininity. If you got to know me and especially youre a guy you would probably notice I am attracted to men at some point if you were to look for it.  But you wouldnt be able to tell just based on my general behavior. Like everyone I have masculine and feminine traits although I lean towards the masculine side cause thats what expresses me best. I like being masculine I just dont want to overdo it and become brutish since I value grace and sophistication.  Even so while pursuing these qualities I have changed myself significantly since I was a kid.  I have changed the way I talk I think even the way I move and walk. Of course I couldnt naturally start talking like Stallone even if I wanted to since Im just not like that but I have made adequate changes so I can feel good about myself and how others perceive me.  Since you mentioned voice I dont have a beautiful timbre thats sadly not up to me but I have been consciously working on my tone and cadence since I was a child because I spoke too fast and I dont think anyone would disagree that Ive made impressive progress.  Ive spoken in front of hundreds of people on certain occasions and the feedback I got was unequivocal. Plus confirmation bias is there too. When you speak to someone that you suspect of being gay all their feminine qualities suddenly start feeling exaggerated to you  on the other hand when you speak to someone that youre sure hes straight no matter what he does it seems masculine.  If you observe gay guys outside of the pop gay culture which gay YouTubers are practically the very embodiment of youll see that if you are objective theyre actually pretty average if theyre not living in harsh social conditions.  Personally as a kid I cant say I had it easy so I couldve turned out much differently but luckily I never had this flamboyant archetype pushed onto me. I didnt watch that kind of trash TV that usually propagates such caricatures and generally I wasnt in touch with pop culture. My parents also didnt influence me too much in either direction they just made sure I was welleducated and other than that they were pretty absent from my life. I also didnt have too many friends to impose their own perceptions onto me so I was generally almost completely allowed to freely grow the way I wanted to as long as I was wellbehaved and did well in my activities.  It was a very lonely life but I wouldnt change the result for anything.,gay,d7dvxll,1,t5_2qhef

9093184,0,t3_54sxfw,Prostates are amazing.  Youre tight because youre not used to having your hole invaded.  Dont try to stretch it out thats not how it works.  Play with it gently lube is a really good idea start with a finger dont have to necessary plunge inside and your holes fight reaction will change over time.  Asking what am I implies that there are just a few kinds of people.  Thats misleading.  Human sexuality is complicated.  Were attracted to all kinds of things including sex organs but also build disposition personality humor confidence etc etc.  Were also attracted to the forbidden more often than not.Porn might be your preferred outlight but this sounds to me like a general case of the shutins.  If you dont have to go out in the world and interact with people you chose not but then porn is how you spend your time.  Being introverted by itself isnt bad but sometimes people with introverted tendencies will get way behind on practise enteracting with people and participating in different social things even simple stuff like riding the bus and then will naturally  get anxious about it.  Having some level of forced socialization can be good.  It sounds like you lack that.gt The best way I can explain this is that extremely rarely I will be absolutely overcome with the desire to have sex but I cant feel the drive to pursue it. Yes I think you are overthinking things.  Youre obsessed with sex acts but you dont even have a real life crush.  Maybe try going somewhere where you can crush on guys or gals.  The beach?  The mall?  Idly watch some volleyball or something.  Or go dance.  Exactly what youll have to figure out.  Definitely try to reconnect your sexuality to real people though.  Itll probably be easier to do that first then ease off on the porn rather than just sitting there at home and trying not to watch porn.Dont even obsess over a gender.  Just be open with yourself and experiences.  Crush on whoever you crush on.  If you dont want to make it something regular or you dont want a relationship then just dont and dont make commitments to the other person that you dont actually want to make in the hopes that thats what they want to hear.  That just makes two people unhappy when you do that.gt How can I eel the desire to top and to pleasure my prostate at the same time?There arent two flavors of people or even three P  In real life youd figure out something to do with your hookup or your boyfriend that you both enjoy and youll be pretty happy with that and then youll maybe do something different next time.

9761905,0,t1_dagd3mt,I get what youre saying about erasure of other queer issues. At the same time were talking about this particular one because...its the one under discussion? Its the one Trump was asked specifically about after all. And tbh that makes sense. Samesex marriage was only recently legalized on a federal level and now that right may be jeopardized. As you know we still dont have federal nondiscrimination protections in employment or housing. So the former is something weve recently won but may lose again whereas the latter are things weve never had in the first place. Theyre two different but obviously related battles.Also fwiw I dont fully agree that marriage is the only LGBT right that people talk about. Bathroom bills have been in the news for months for example. Hate crime legislation when it was still being proposeddrafted was another major point of conversation. Companies that extend health benefits to samesex partners is something else thats sadly been controversial. So yes maybe marriage has gotten some undue attention at the expense of other concerns but no I dont think it has totally monopolized the conversation.Not to mention that for better or for worse samesex marriage is as much a symbolic issue as it is a practical one so that may be another reason it seems to have heightened importance to so many people. ,gay,dagdey8,1,t5_2qhef

But the last four or so hookups felt so empty to me.So Ive consciously decided to stop hooking up and go back to being friends first and maybe even a relationship first sometime.

On his campaign website Trump vowed to sign it.Really? Because it looks as if either you or the article is way off base then. According to the article this bill would legalize discrimination based on sexual association. Freedom of Religion is great and all even though its the freedom to practice any religion you want not the freedom to do whatever you want and claim your religion as an excuse. These two things extremely frequently overlap in the US but the Constitution also guarantees equal protection under the law to every citizen among various other protections. Its important to note that this text doesnt quantify which citizens are protected it explicitly states that every citizen will be protected equally.

Pandering to every little quirk a teenager has absolutely does more harm than good because it creates a false sense of entitlement and security instead of teaching and reenforcing positive or professional social decorum.Protecting them via policies that teach them Its okay to take this stance but absolutely not okay to harm someone else because they dont is what the goal needs to be not creating one separate niche after another after another. I believe trans kids are special and unique. But I also believe that they and all other kids need to put all of that on hold for a minute until they are at a point when theyre thinking more rationally and are less impulsive after high school. Extracurricular groups and classes that teach everyone are one thing. They help teach how to take part in civil discourse.

11306124,0,t3_618tae,The mainstream media often portrays gay people in a stereotypical way.  But I love the diversity of gay personalities.  From the flamboyant like Carson Kressly to the more subdued Mitchell Pritchett in Modern Family played by Jesse Tyler Ferguson.  I think most media like to portray gay men who at least act a little stereotypical.  Will for example isnt really straightacting and probably neither is Mitch in Modern Family.   But I think through these characters we see something that is at the heart of all gay people no matter how they act and thats whats important.   I think shows like Queer as Folk amp The L Word have helped show that we come in many varieties.As for the Jack McFarlane character he may have acted flamboyant but I think it was an offshoot of deeper issues in his personality rather than being gay.  This was the good thing about Will amp Grace as they really dug into those characters and Jack as with Karen always struck me as an exception not the rule.Flamboyancy can be an act to a degree.  I know several drag queens that when they put their costumes on they transform into these outrageously fun people yet out of the makeup and garish dresses etc theyre actually pretty quiet. At least the media has moved past portraying gays and lesbians as villains or sick bitter twisted people like they did in the past and these days have positive representations of gay culture and people.,gay,dfdj62z,1,t5_2qhef

I thought my mom would be ok but my dad picture a huge physically intimidating redneck who always yells when he talks lol I didnt know whatd hed say or do. I was in detox again and I knew that I wanted to be happy and I wanted to be me so I called my parents and told them over the phone. They said we dont care we just want you to be happy. When they came to visit me my dad was all quite and he told me he loved me no matter what I did or who I loved then hugged me. I cried. Then he ask so does this mean ur gonna start skipping and wearing glitter lol. I laughed and told him no dad. He laughed and said well idk I dont care Im just asking. Ive never been happier in my life and weve all grown together. If you think you can muster up the courage do it and dont look back because the bottom line is the only persons happiness that matters is yours and you being true to yourself is a great way to start.

Coming out to my mother was a somber and serious event that went very well as she was supportive of me. At the end of the conversation I told her I was telling dad tomorrow and I was concerned he wouldnt be okay with me anymore. Fast forward half an hour and my dad is calling me panicked because my mom gave him heads up that i was coming over to tell him something serious and to him hes not sure if Im hospitalized murdered someone or anything else and says he wont calm down till he knows whats going on. So I go over to his place and tell him and the first thing he says is So when are we going dress shopping? and proceeds to go on saying its alright and he was concerned something bad happened.

11570449,0,t3_655798,The lines between preference and discrimination are definitely blurry.Noone wants to be with someone who theyre not attracted to but at the same time I think we have to recognise how our preferences are shaped by years of systemic racism against people of colour. The whole point of it being systemic is that youve been bombarded with these messages from mainstream media etc since you were born. Theyve shaped everyones views including those of people of colour which is why we often feel so much selfhate when trying to navigate Grindr etc. So when people tell you that your preferences make you racist theyre not attacking you personally. Your preferences and the preferences of pretty much everyone are the unfortunate consequence of growing up and living in a racist world. People can make a conscious decision to challenge their preferences and explore why they feel the way they do but it does require you to acknowledge that yes your preferences regarding race do come from a place of systemic racism.,gay,dg7ila7,11,t5_2qhef

When I came out everyone gossiped about it for a summer then the next Christmas I brought my now husband home. And everyone gossiped for a week. Then they all found new things to gossip about because no one really cares that Im gay.

That being said most of my straight friends are about the same age Im  as well and a lot of them dont have kids and I have gay friends who do have kids. So no worries in that department.

I myself had partners who came to me AFTER intercourse and complained how their whole life would be destroyed if they got any STDs from me.
