1174309,0,t1_ci1hgei,gtPhysique isnt beautyYour chart says physique is beauty and the primary trait for seduction Black Widow Bruce Lee and Michael Phelps are all attractive fit people.  Please see my reply to SageMountains post that you referred to in your post.When it comes down to it players are already in charge of their aesthetics in TT with  stats.  Condensing stats into  categories is more about mechanics than aesthetics.  Now what if my campaign is about Han Solo and Chewbacca flying around on the Millenium Falcon.  Han Solo is dashing but not that strong and Chewbacca is ugly but very strong.  What do their Physique stats look like?  If they are about equal then Han Solo can arm wrestle a wookie mechanically this is a contested roll physique and Princess Leia stands a pretty good chance at ending up with Chewie rather than Han mechanically this is a physique check and probably a greatly decreased one at that since Leia is pretty hard to catch.If you penalize Hans physique score because he isnt very strong then Han no longer stands toetotoe with Chewbacca in arm wrestles but Chewie will totally be able to seduce Leia before Han ever has a shot. If you penalize Chewies physique because he is ugly then he isnt going to be able to steal Hans thunder anymore but he will now lose arm wrestles to puny humans.I feel like if you combine STR and CHA my ability to aesthetically control my characters will be undermined by the mechanics of the system as shown in these examples.,taverntales,ci1qabo,2,t5_31fsf
1175819,0,t1_ci1h52f,Well hrm... Lets look at DnD . but it applies to other versions too because this ones pretty common and because Im in an awesome campaign playing it now.  In DnD we have ability score the big  and skills the small however many because there are a LOT of skills in .e.  When you go to do something in DnD its usually either an attack or a skill.  When youre trying to tumble under that door you might say I roll under the door and at the last second grab my hat! I cant leave it behind! And thats great make your tumble check.  And tumble is the important word here.Or maybe youve got someone prisoner but you dont have any bindings.  I look around the battlefield for something to tie him up!  Great make a spot check.What Im not saying is that we need skills in TT what Im saying is that these are verbs. Tumble spot hide appraise.  Most of them are verbs anyway.  You wanna do something?  Describe it and then find the right verb from the list.But Skills dont really work in TT Or they might idk its your game and Ive only played it once.  So maybe lets look at Dungeon World.  Now Ive not played DW but Ive watch some play videos and read most of it.  And it gives the players a lot a freedom. But thats not terribly important whats important are moves.  Because DW has a bunch of moves like Hack and Slash and Defy Danger.  Most of them are also verbs theyre things the players can do.  Essentially the problem is players cant strength.  They can use their strength but its not really the same thing.  They can use their wisdom but they cant wisdom.Its a strange case the system you have works but to me it doesnt truly work.  For my game I borrowed a bunch of fundamentals from DW for my game when I played it.  So yeah stuff like giving players control of stuff having them name things and so forth.  Anyway this post is long and doesnt really say anything valid so Ima shut up now.,taverntales,ci1wed3,2,t5_31fsf
1282345,0,t3_28rnok,Heres my idea  . Base Toughness is   . Each stat has a Toughness Bonus attached to it   Brawn gt  TB   Spirit gt  TB   Finesse gt  TB   Mind gt  TB  . After you apply your stat scores add the TB of your top  stats to your Toughness  These TB allocations are just me guessing how well someone with that stat as their primary stat would react to being hit so its just my opinion. This way the brawny tough guys would be tougher while the wimpy smart guys would be wimpier.,taverntales,cidvppj,1,t5_31fsf

1477562,0,t1_cj1hgi6,Ill add in clarifying rules for how players can go about healing permanent injuries. Dont worry  the last thing I want is for players to be running around with constantly decreases stats. These injuries are supposed to be interesting challenges that players have to overcome using available resources. Like do they keep pressing on despite the fact that the wizard took a nasty head wound and is at  Mind or do they they go back to town for extensive healing? ,taverntales,cj1hldk,3,t5_31fsf

1908349,0,t3_2gfd0h,When I designed Spellbook I was trying to capture the feeling of the wellprepared wizard.The idea is that youre supposed to write down a description beforehand. Then if you do something that matches that description you can cross it off to cash in on your foresight. So lets suppose that you have the Arcane trait Evoker. You might write down the following description A blazing ball of fire.When you use Evoker to create an explosion you can cross off that explosion to increase the roll.But lets suppose that youre fighting at an alchemist shop and an enemy is hiding behind a barrel full of dangerous chemicals. You might say Hey GM can I blow up the barrel hes hiding behind?GM Sure!Im prepared for this! Since the barrel will explode in flames Im going to cross off my spell A blazing ball of fire to increase the roll!In this case your action also matches the description of the spell so you can cross it off to get the bonus.Basically the spells that you write in your spellbook are all aesthetics. When you do something mechanically that matches a spell aesthetically cross off the spell to get the bonus. I hope that clears things up. ,taverntales,ckj56sa,6,t5_31fsf

2036032,0,t1_ckyj9en,Writing the following assuming youre unfamiliar with FFGs dice forgive me if you areIn FFGs system you roll a number of good dice that show a few different symbols.  Theres Success Advantage and Triumph.  When you attempt a task you roll your good dice number and type of die determine by trainingcharacteristics and roll them against a number of bad dice which generate Failure Threat and Despair.  Success and failures cancel each other out and if you have any Success left over you complete the task Threat and Advantage also cancel each other out and are used to trigger side effects.  Say I roll a success on a combat roll but I wind up with  Threat as well.  The GM can spend those to give my enemy an extra maneuver increase his next roll or whatever else he wants to spend them on.  The player gets to decide how to spend any Advantage they end up with theres a list of mechanical choices but they are encouraged to make something up that helps them either narratively or mechanically pending GM approval.Triumph and Despair are rarer.  Players can spend Triumphs to accomplish their action above and beyond and gain extra things related to the task or just do something AWESOME.  Despair the GM spends to have the opposite happen... something TERRIBLE goes down.In Numenera havent played am just familiar with the system uses a D when you roll high you get to either take extra damage on your attack or describe how you go above and beyond and accomplish more than you planned.  Same with low except the GM decides.TT is already more narrative than either of these systems with tons of player participation.  A danger with your system could be that the players dont want to make their negative effects rolling low very strong but I think if someones playing TT and enjoys the system theyll be into it.  Besides even when something terrible happens the player is still picking the effect for the character!  Pending GM approval its tough to get mad at yourself for rolling badly then having to come up with a consequence.  Besides if youre stuck making up something terrible for your character I think thats additional incentive to make it awesome.I found this sub a few weeks back thus I havent gotten to actually play in a TT game yet but Im hopeful!  Its a great system and I hope youre able to go far with it.,taverntales,ckymhw3,2,t5_31fsf

2901896,0,t3_2t21yb, XP at chargen isnt enough to build a character with the same power as a starting character in the previous rules.Im also concerned with the way the defense roll rules affect stronger or weaker enemies.The defense roll is based on the skill of the Defender and not of the Attacker. So if the Attacker was Godzilla or a Goblin the Defender would still be the one to roll. In this case you could use increasedecrease but what about the enemies that are in between?It seems that the power of an Attackers attack against a PC would be mostly based on their damage which seems simpler but also limiting. What about the kinds of monsters that are good at attacking but dont deal very much damage?,taverntales,cnxy9h5,2,t5_31fsf
3054608,0,t3_2usui8,From the poll it looks like Im in the minority. But I guess Ill post my thoughts anyway.I liked the old traits better. Some of the new ones I like old man with a walking stick! I really like this one. Lots of possibilities there. But to me the feel of Arcane as a whole especially the combat block has gone from interesting bits I can use to piece together my own unique character to feeling more like a kit or class package. Too many effects are squished into the same trait so anyone who wants any of those effects has to take all of them leading to pretty sameyfeeling characters. Theres no difference between the ki blaster the evoker and the guy with dragons breath because the evoker now has ALL the aoe keywords in one trait plus spammable knockback. The cantripritual squish also bothers me. A stage magician and a cultist shouldnt both be forced into the same trait when both only want to use half of what they have.A Battlemage and a Wizard both take the exact same trait now arcane power. Whereas before one only wanted force armor and the other wanted magic missile. Now theyre mechanically the same.Others have commented on the huge power ramp up so I wont repeat it but I agree. Some of these traits just seem really strong for the investment. Most of them seem like the old trait with  upgrades pumped into it already.And I liked the old detect magic. The vagueness allowed me to choose how I detected magic and it became an integral part of my character. I liked that there wasnt flavor text already there.,taverntales,coelwjo,4,t5_31fsf

3818603,0,t1_cqrhkhg,I am. However I do feel that the variety in psionics also i spart of the reason. If you want to do an engineer you use artifice. If you want to do barbarian take savagery. A ranger you take tracking. But Psionics is this weird mishmash of telekinesis mind readingcontrol and precognition. Dragon is a bit the same way where you usually dont want to have the theme as the focus of your character but rather just take a couple of awesome traits like living weapon which I think is used in  of my characters.It works well but when I then want to make a character based around telekinesis I take  traits from psionics and go Well how do I fill out the rest? and start taking from all over the place.,taverntales,cqrjv5n,1,t5_31fsf

6794977,0,t1_d0mbcxg,gt Im assuming that the reward is per playerYesgtDoes running away from the challenge count as completing it for the purposes of the reward?No. If implemented the language would clarify that this is a reward for successfully completing the challengegt I agree with craftymalehooker that there needs to be some form of scaling with the number of boxes the players actually haveAgreed. This is easily implemented as something along the lines of The intensity of your reward tales should correspond to the intensity of the context. The more epic the story the more epic the reward or somesuch. Then provide examples.gt So do Conditionsdefenses count? This is something I want to evaluate through testing.gt Should there be a mechanic to allow players to buy extra boxes with xp? Yes  traits that grant defenses.gt Also this change seems like it will really buff Comedy and Tragedy Bardic Lore as players may just machine gun the token in order to advance their goals while also getting a better reward at the end because of it. Any significant rules change will require me to go back and update preexisting traits. CampT would definitely need to be changed but not removed because I personally adore CampT.gt Im personally more of a fan of at least allowing dipping to  but Im also somewhat of a powergamer. It DOES seem like it might prevent negative stat use as a positive thing thoughwith the addition of Tension rewards using especially low stats would allow people to rack up bad tales more easily allowing them a better reward at the end. Im not sure if  is the ideal. This is just an experiment to see how people respond. However I think a lot of people can generally agree that the current rules with the  promotes powergaming a little bit more than it should.gt Im also a bit more hesitant on that because thinking of my current character I feel like  spirit simply is easier than taking  flaws that relate to their hideous mutilated form and inability to relate to people. While the flaws would still allow them to fail the rolls they rightfully should be failing for a character as flawed as mine it seems like Ill miss a spot with the descriptors. Would it be possible to reduce the stat to  and simply not get any bonus experience to it? Or am I the only one who would have this problem? Im not sure. As a designer I tend to start with very broad concepts and then slowly narrow in on the details. Right now Im primarily concerned with evaluating whether or not flaws are viable. If they are I can zero in on the specific and figure out precise wording that appeals to a lot of players.gt Just a question of usage the GM declares something like a attack a trap collapsing bridge political rivals plots etc and then one of the characters gets to make a roll to see if they can avoid the danger? Is that how it would be used? Is it entirely up to the players who would get to react the the action?Yes to all.,taverntales,d0mi1lz,2,t5_31fsf
6798652,0,t1_d0mwh94,Well thats not what I typed but I reread the rules and I get how Tensin boxes work now... They are essentially HP.We dont type what they signify but we should still explain what is troubling them on the path to completing the challenge right?Does every Bad Tale necessarily need to mean that a Tension box is checked or could the consequence be more narrative?If the fiction calls for it a Bad Tale could just as well be an applied Condition?This is part of the reason I think maybe criticals Rolling    for example would indicate a critical fail would give the GM reasons to maybe apply a condition from the fiction or describe something going really bad.Changing the CN and its focus... or something along those lines.Maybe you dont want to go that route but I feel there are these holes in the mechanics right now.Or maybe I havent fully grasped your intent with them yet.,taverntales,d0mx45n,2,t5_31fsf
