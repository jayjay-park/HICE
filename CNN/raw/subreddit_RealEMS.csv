2565876,0,t3_2p4isw,Maybe the jackass with the phone should try working a twelve plus hour shift and understand that at some point people just need to sleep and as we all know its exceedingly common for ems staff to catch a nap whenever they can.

4678017,0,t3_3ezgbc,The main reason Ive been told not use the big stretcher on a normal Pt is that they dont weigh it down in enough in the event of an accident. We just keep one at our station in the event of needed it to swap.Other shitty awesome thing about them is you can only use them in single stretcher units as there isnt room for two if one is bariatric. ,RealEMS,ctk7nq8,2,t5_33jry
4957800,0,t3_3ir2fz,What a fantastic story! Im so happy and thankful you got what was coming for you. I hope things work out for the patient as well. Really really awesome story. Well told too I think. Thank you so much for sharing.You know its so strange isnt it? When you get into EMS you think the really memorable and monumental experiences of the job will be all the gnarly blood and guts traumas which is sometimes the case but more often than not its the simple humanitarian stuff like this. ,RealEMS,cujgyl9,2,t5_33jry

6252946,0,t3_40o4aj,At my department we run with one medic and two emts.  Unless a call is ALS the medic works under the EMT.  We have our job and need to be good at it so when we do get ALS we dong need the medic to be telling us what to do do unless hisher skills are needed they hang back and pass us our tools.  Its good for both them and us.  First off it lets us practice our skills rather than watch someone else do it.  It also lets the medic watch us and after the call give us pointers and learn to trust us and our judgment.  It also shows us respect which goes a long way in building a team.In our area its looked at like this.  Anything you can do as an EMT you must be better than a medic at so that the medic can focus on doing the things only he can do.,RealEMS,cz0e4tr,1,t5_33jry

10536697,0,t1_dd2fv8d,Im still a medic student so someones bound to correct me. This rhythm is called Torsades De Pointes Turning of the Points its an uncommon type of VTach where the ventricles allow reentry of the electrical impulse thus creating the VTach rhythm that turns upside down then right side up again showing where the current is moving if that makes any sense at all.  Its pretty neat if youre into cardiology.,RealEMS,dd2g8zc,1,t5_33jry
