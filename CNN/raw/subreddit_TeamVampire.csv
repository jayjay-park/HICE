5004820,0,t3_3jhg7t,For me its something to keep me on track. To push me back to my routine before I went on my long vacation. Also Im somewhat a team player lol so more accountability for me to keep doing it  Before I went on my vacation in  ampampampamp a half months I was able to lose lbs. Lots of dedication. Exercise. Occasional cheat days . During my vacation I didnt have my scale with me. And I tried everything I could because hell I was on a vacation. Mind you that in Asia its pretty easy to rent a bike to get around so thats what I did haha... And of course after  weeks there I gained lbs... A bit heartbreaking but no regrets!!! And after lurking on rloseit for awhile I learned that as long as I dont give up I will be able to get back on track. No matter how long my cheat days weeks months. DONT GIVE UP!! I CAN DO THIS!! Soooo for my very first challenge I hope to exercise xweek ampampampamp weight lbs I am lbs!!! I would love to set my goal higher but small goals  big goal  I am currently pushing myself to run x per week. Would love to lift weight again but need to get my Campus card back from the lostampampampampfound office first . Anyway sorry for my long wandering reply lol. I look forward to work with you guys to laugh with you guys and to cry with some of you guys during this challenge TLDR get back on track. Lose at least lbs at the end of the challenge. Exercise xweekGo Team Vampire!!!! ,TeamVampire,cup9opu,4,t5_39ray

5076276,0,t3_3kiz3t,A lb gain from last week but still a . loss from the start date so maybe thats something? Silver lining? It was a combination of stress from my dad being in the hospital and horrible PMS cravings that I didnt do as well resisting as I should have. Its a new week time to get back on track. ,TeamVampire,cuxvsb6,3,t5_39ray
5602774,0,t3_3rs5vc,Not as good as I wanted to. I was losing  pounds a week for like  months before the challenge started now my loss is much more haphazard. I adjusted my calories of course but dont seem to lose what I should according to calculations. I guess its okay though since Im still losing something and even at a slow rate I should be a normal weight for the first time ever within a few months.,TeamVampire,cwrktk2,2,t5_39ray
