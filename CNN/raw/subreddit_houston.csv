79247,0,t1_cenealv,I would argue that Houston is less Southern than Atlanta. We dont emphasize any deep ties to the South or its history. Texas and therefore Houston is very much more independent of Americas history  we Texas were our own nation there for a while and our settlers although primarily from Europe Germany Czechoslovakia Poland came much later than the folks who founded Atlanta and had very different experiences including having to deal with another sovereign nation i.e. Mexico. In short our history is different.Houstons current population is primarily first or second generation immigrants and because of that people are generally welcoming and open to new things.  And Ive never met a native Houstonian I didnt like as far as that goes.  We dont have a twangy drawl and a penchant for sweet tea either.  Even whats considered local food draws on more traditions that the deep souths and youll find much more creole influence.Ive never seen Atlantas pride parade but ours is pretty damn big and the mayor a lesbian attends every year.  The gay community here was such a power bloc they helped get Kathy Whitmire into office and although Montrose is no longer a deeply gay area the original most identifiable gay bars are gone their heydey done Houston as a whole is pretty open minded.  And we still have plenty of gay bars.Galveston is relatively close but it is dirty brown water.  Dont let that stop you though.  Schlitterbahn Water Park is nice and a season pass is like . Totally worth it.  Plus you have Moody Gardens plenty of historical homes to tour a warbird museum.  Renting a bike and cycling down the seawall is fun as it doing a day at the Galveston State Park beach which is person or yr for a family pass.Id also take the free Bolivar Peninsula ferry at least once just to see the bay.  I guess Im saying although the water and sand arent the draw you can find other parts of the Gulf of Mexico theres still plenty to do in Galveston.And there is a ton of stuff to do in Houston.  We have ballet opera a symphony orchestra theatre and a kick ass monthlong rodeo with that draws  people a night.  If youve never seen that before well I recommend you get yourself some  value Wednesday tickets and enjoy the show.Edit We also have a kickass park system cycling trails a skate park and disc golf courses.,houston,ceng8r6,12,t5_2qj1l

My guess is the Dry District laws will trump the revised  ft law.On another note I also heard the Specs that was open for a short time near the circle at the end of Washington next to Memorial Park had closed due to this law.

634349,0,t3_21eqxg,No.  Houston has had a very natural rise in property value increases.  Last year many places had unbelievable growth Houston was not one.  For example in Los Angeles home values increased by .  If there is any sort of bubble it will be in the rent market.  Rent to homeownsership ratios are getting out of whack and the advantages to renting are really starting to deteriorate.  This will lead many to leave apartments and buy houses fueling the next wave of demand for resales and new home builds.  Finally there is  billion dollars in planned construction on the East side town as the natural gas boom has made making petrochemicals in America feasible again.  There are  billion in planned projects one third here in Houston.  This will bring an absolute influx of workers into Houston particularly blue collar workers during the construction phase.  Afterwards it will support many white collars engineers and the like plus a healthy handful of blue collar techs support etc. Lastly lenders are being extremely cautious about who to lend money to still.  Last time the falling market was caused by the influx of foreclosures and the availability of houses for pennies on the dollar.  Why buy a full price house when you can get one on a discount?  Then because they cannot sell their house to the influx of REO property legit sellers had to slash prices.  The number one indicator of market value for an appraiser is comparable sales.  If comparables are dealing with a  discount well the appraisal is going to come back lower obviously.  So in sum heck no.  There is zero evidence of a Houston real estate bubble.  A slowdown? Of course that is natural.  A bubble? No way.   Out of curiosity why would you ask this? ,houston,cgcdjod,9,t5_2qj1l

Ive lived in houston all my life and parked my car all over the city at all times of the day and night...I have had my car broken into twice both times in montrose. They dont want to harm any body they just want money. You dont hear about a many murders or anything like that in montrose but countless thefts. They wait until you park they watch you go into a store or whatever and them they are in and out of your car in probably about  seconds. Its nearly impossible to catch them because theyre so good at it so basically your only defense is to not leave anything in the car or at the very least make sure nothing valuable is visible. Put things in the trunk or take them with you. Even if a cop caught them which is nearly impossible they would spend one night in jail and be stealing again the next day bc it works and they live off it. ,houston,ch325mm,5,t5_2qj1l

1036061,0,t1_chlw27t,First of all I really dont think you know what youre talking about here.Have you actually been to that part of the bayou?I dont care if technically the bayou is not in the park or if the Google Maps makes it look like its not unspoiled wilderness.  Just go there and see for yourself  for about  of a mile it feels like you are truly in the middle of nowhere hundreds of miles from the nearest town aside from the distant hum of traffic.No there are no new trails being constructed here.  What trails are there have been there for decades.  Bikes have been banned from that section of the park for  years due to erosion concerns so they are just for pedestrians now.No its not near houses.  Its true that the golf course is on the other side of the bayou but you cant see that from the park side of the bayou.  If you honestly think this is a bunch of rich people complaining you really have no idea what you are talking about.I honestly think it would be a travesty if this is lost.  The wilderness feel of Buffalo Bayou between Shepherd and Sabine is being lost though actually I feel this is a good thing as part of the current project to make that a new urban park.  Why not leave this last section as wilderness?Over the years I have really enjoyed my time exploring Memorial Park and seeing things like the ruins of Camp Logan.  Theres nothing else like this nearby except for part of Terry Hershey Park but thats also endangered for an unrelated reason.  Its people like you people who have apparently never been to this part of the park and only know it from Google Maps who are having a kneejerk reaction to this thinking there must be some great conspiracy who are going to encourage this project to happen just because you want to pontificate about something you know nothing about.There was an excellent article about this a few months ago in one of the main local publications.  Someone else linked to a Houston Press article that may have been it but for some reason I recall something on the subscriptiononly side of the Chronicle site too.Maybe the site linked above is a bit sensationalist but you are being even more sensationalist in the opposite direction.The photo that it shows of this is their plan is indeed their plan.  Sure it will only look like that for a limited time but it takes a long time to recover.  In a few decades once the section of the bayou from Shepherd to Sabine has recovered if they allow it to then maybe we can take another look at this.,houston,chm1zor,7,t5_2qj1l

But the indiegogo does not have anything to do with that?Your presentationpitch is amateur at best when compared to most successful kickstarters bad pictures text is not focused trying to do too many things and theres no differentiation from the . other gaming bars in the area.  Why define yourself with gaming?  Its going to be considered a negative by a whole lot of consumers.  From your indiegogo pitch it sounds like youre most excited about the table games so have you considered just opening a casual brewpub with table games available?

1145833,0,t3_278w5x,Ive photographed at all times of day from one end of Galveston to the other. Girls in swimsuits too. Not to discourage you but you will have a tough time pulling off those looks on Galveston. That being said you may get some truly beautiful sunrises and sunsets. As slamein already mentioned Galveston is experiencing record seaweed this year and its virtually everywhere. It gets a little better the further west you go. In my opinion youre probably best off at San Luis Pass no ferry needed. If you are down there in the mornings during the week it should be fairly desolate the sand dunes are nice less seaweed and if you look to the east during sunrise it should be fairly unobstructed. Looking west towards sunset youll see the bridge houses and other unwanted objects. You might also think about going across San Luis Pass into Freeport or Surfside. There are some areas over there with cool driftwood and almost no humans in the way. Youll need decent WD to get around some places. Plan to spend some time scouting a day or two before you shoot as things change depending on weather and tides. Feel free to PM me or ask questions in here. ,houston,chyiocr,3,t5_2qj1l

My guess is it will reverse directions on Main between Capitol and Rusk going the wrong way on the track for half a block or so either going into or out of the station because they dont have a cloverleaf setup but rather only one connection to each of the two parallel tracks.In East Downtown some trains will continue east down Harrisburg and others probably most of them will go southeast to the UH campus instead.,houston,ci489ov,2,t5_2qj1l

If youre going to sign a petition that impacts a COH ordinance then your signature only counts if you are COH resident and were registered to vote when the ordinance was approved by your city council member.

1703104,0,t1_cjtt30e,The liability and insurance is no different. BMX is the bastard child of extreme sports thanks to people with opinions like yours. It just doesnt make sense to me that people go to such exhaustive lengths to exclude a special interest group that is no different besides our choice of weapon when it comes to slaying concrete transition. And I dont understand why wasting more taxpayer dollars is the best solution. The group is called Houston United BMXers HUB. The reason you only see kids bitching on facebook is because any organized effort is squashed by the city. There is a BMX only park in the works which was only offered by the Greenspoint Redevelopment Authority the moment they heard we staged a protest at the grand opening of the spring park. Im beating a dead horse by saying this but PUSH the Greenspoint Redevelopment Authority and Sally Bradford are only a few who are trying to keep us quiet and in the dark when it comes to these projects before they break ground. All we have is a facebook page with about  members there just isnt the money in BMX as there is in skateboarding. In Austin BMXers and skaters are treated no different from one another why Houston has this prejudice against BMX I dont know. If you want PM me and I can connect you with the leaders of HUB because we need more people to fight along side us. ,houston,cjtu72a,1,t5_2qj1l

Riding a bike to work makes a great deal of sense  fast commute and great mileage.  The possible downsides  its freeking hot here a lot of the year you will be drenched in sweat wearing leathers  Houstons traffic is not bike friendly hell we have trouble missing the streetlevel trains  it frequently rains here in the summer  downtown parking is mo depending on where you park so that might play into things but you might get a better deal for a bike. No idea.As others have stated Camden Midtown is hella close man. According to Google Maps it is a . mile walk to Travis  Rusk.  Downtowns zipcode is  if you want to play with maps yourself.If you dont feel like walking thats a short commute via rail or bus Metro is . each way before any discounts for using their stored value card or employer benefits.

When we look at it this way Downtown Houston is in good shape and in the right direction.Also I should remind you that there are many other major cities not located in the Southern U.S. in which their CBDs are just as dead as Houstons.  For example Salt Lake City Detroit or Phoenix.  Even Downtown Los Angeles is unimpressive after PM and the weekends.,houston,ckfg1bw,1,t5_2qj1l

Personally now that Ive got a social life established in Montrose I would prefer to live near work on a major freeway so getting into the city would just take twenty minutes or so.

The hurricanes accrued damage toll is the third costliest of any Atlantic hurricane unadjusted for inflation Ike developed from a tropical wave west of Cape Verde on September  and quickly strengthened to a peak intensity as a Categoryhurricane over the open waters of the central Atlantic on September as it tracked westward. Several fluctuations in strength occurred before Ike made landfall on eastern Cuba on September. The hurricane weakened prior to continuing into the Gulf of Mexico restrengthening up until a final landfall on Galveston Texas on September the remnants of Ike continued to track across the United States and into Canada before dissipating two days later.gtgtImage iInteresting Effects of Hurricane Ike in Texas | Effects of Hurricane Ike in inland North America |  Atlantic hurricane season | Galveston Texas Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwclsv oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeleteclsv.

Scoot them under appliances behind toilet under bathroom cabinetry etc. Also I second the boric acid powder treatment. One thing I have done in the past is unscrew the outlet covers from the wall use the boric acid squeeze bottle to squeeze a good amount of that powder in the space around the outlet cover then replace the cover. Check any plumbing entrance to your apartment  under the sink toilet intake etc. and if theres a hole around it squeeze boric acid powder and then stop up the hole with steel wool.They are looking for warm humid places with cardboard they eat cellulose. Get rid of any cardboard boxes you have. They love mess. Clean up those paper piles keep the kitchen spotless run the disposal daily. NEVER LEAVE FOOD OUT.Then just in case they are coming in through the sewer pipes make sure you cover the shower drain and stop up the sinks when you are not using them. My husbands apartment was overrun with these things before we married amp he moved to my place. He was a Yankee at that point and had no idea how to get rid of them.

You could enjoy just walking from the WaterfallTrevisio all the way to the Cancer Prevention Building completely indoors using MD Andersons pedestrian bridges. You need a badge to get into the BSRB building that is attached to WaterfallTrevisio but after that its a public walk. The cafeteria at TIRR is very good and really cheap. Its the cheapest food Ive seen in the Med Center. I dont remember if you need a badge to get in there. Most institutions that have patients would probably be easy enough to explore. There are some VERY cool buildings that are for research but you definitely need a badge to get in there.

Start at the highest level and look down and the next and it probably is about  ft elevation difference.  Could also get into the distance they have to span and to keep curves design speed at  mph or whatever faster speed means longer curves. Look at an old intersection like North Loop and  vs a new one like North Loop and   much more gradual turns wider lanes less bottleneck effect. ,houston,cmysq3o,2,t5_2qj1l

He will also negotiate on your behalf with the insurance company for aftermarket parts that were damaged.Hes got a great following in the Houston Subaru community  go check out his shop and decide for yourself. Its so clean you can literally eat off the floors.It also helps that hes a fellow car enthusiast and even though Butch owns the shop he still works on the cars that come through because hes obsessed about quality. Butch used to work at a Subaru dealership but left to start his own shop because he wasnt satisfied with how the dealership was always about the bottom line and saving money  so he started his own shop to focus on quality work.Let me know if you have any questions!edit a photo I took of his shop ,houston,cndapot,1,t5_2qj1l

If you do get a wristband it seems like most people show up around ish depending on the tent.

But he says in the title he wants noncraft beer so I guess that means he wants something imported or one of the macro lagers. I dont know why he wouldnt say imported if he wanted that specifically and like  of bars in town sell at least one macro lager so I dont really know exactly what he is looking for.And to address your other post lol at your suggestion of West Alabama Ice House if you want to avoid hipsters.

3092007,0,t1_coigxrl,Thats really pretty much it. I dont mind the music selection but they are turning into a classic rock station. The last new song I can remember hearing was Take Out the Gunman by Chevelle. They overplayed that song but not nearly as much as they still overplay Nirvana.My spotify playlist probably has a lot of similarities there but I didnt title the playlist New Alternative Rock. I dont have a problem with what they play I just think them and other New Alternative stations are killing rock by not making way for the new stuff. There is a market for old rock songs and IMO Nirvana is now classic rock but they play them on the Buzz constantly. Rap stations and pop stations are great about cycling new music through and hell even country stations do it pretty well but if popular rock stations were any indication of the industry youd think Rock music died sometime around .I think theres a place to go back in time for some hits but when a majority of your runtime is dedicated to the last two decades you are lying to people when you insist that you are the station for currentnew music.,houston,coihh6w,15,t5_2qj1l

3137009,0,t3_2w2k4x,I am posting this twice because two seperate people are looking for similar answers today but I cant recommend JR Smith at HTowne Around Contractors highly enough. At the end of  we had our washing machine leak overnight soaking the floor in the whole front half of the house. I had one contractor come in who wanted about  x what the insurance company said the repair job was worth in order to fix it we were also using the leak as an opportunity to upgrade some stuff. I asked a second contractor who said the first was crazy and he could do it with upgrades for about what the insurance quoted. In MARCH the following year they had only done about  of the work and were quoting way over what they had originally said to complete the work. Then I called JR got his name from Angies List. He was a whole other experience. He was a super nice guy. I showed him what we wanted done he said he could do it for what we were looking to pay and it could be done in about  weeks bear in mind we had waited months to get a fraction of that amount of work done. I was skeptical but he was one of the most reasonably priced contractors of those that came to the house so I decided to give him a go.Man was he spot on the WHOLE process took about  days and it was only that long because my wife decided she didnt want to pick a granite countertop from a sample she wanted to go to the place he buys from to see whole slabs. JR was completely flexible he gave us the address of the stone place he buys from we went she picked out a specific slab she wanted and he had the owner put it aside for him. He had people in and out of my house everyday so we never came home and felt like we were living on a construction site little to no dust left no tools lying around etc. On top of all that he is REALLY responsive to communication if I sent an email I usually got a response within an hour or so.As we got close to the end my wife wanted to make a couple of changes which he could easily have quoted and charged for but instead just agreed to throw them in for the original price no extra cost. I realize I am gushing a little but I really want to get this guy work. There seem to be relatively few truly reliable contractors out there and JR is awesome. ,houston,con5bre,1,t5_2qj1l

No one except a very small minority gave a shit about blacks just like no one gave a shit about Jews until the Holocaust. If Texas seceded today the act of secession would be full of anti Muslim gay abortion and liberal rhetoric. The Slavery argument fails on the fact it requires Politicians and political statements to be honest it was about keeping rich old white people in charge same as all the religious freedom crap is today.,houston,cq6kygc,-3,t5_2qj1l
3635503,0,t1_cq6m75r,Please show me something that contradicts the Texas Declaration of Secession on why the civil war was not about slavery. Before you do let me tell you what I understand is the Confederacy defenders viewpoint nowadays. As I understand it those that defend the Confederacy say that the war wasnt about slavery but rather they were angry about the federal government imposing their laws on the states and that the war was a war for states rights.The second argument is that the North was imposing serious economic reform that the south was not prepared for and that they were going to suffer economically for it. Because of that they deemed it an economic investment to spend money on a war rather than implement the new economic trends of the time. Theyre both crap arguments and Ill tell you why. For the first argument the federal government was moving slowly but surely towards banning slavery. These are the federal laws that the south was unhappy with and the laws that the first state to seceed from the union the state on South Carolina is referring to in the South Carolina Declaration of Secession Take this quote in factgt But an increasing hostility on the part of the nonslaveholding States to the Institution of Slavery has led to a disregard of their obligations and the laws of the general government have ceased to effect the objects of the Constitution.You can also tell they were very hypocritical on it. In the very same Declaration of secession they complain about the Nonslave states exercising their very own states rights like when they complain that in New York its illegal to transport slaves. gtIn the State of New York even the right of transit for a slave has been denied by her tribunals As for the second argument that the North was imposing severe economic reform in the south and that was the cause of secession by the states is true. But BECAUSE it is true it proves that the south was fighting for slavery. Many plantations had hundreds of slaves that provided free farm work for their wealthy owners and the sudden illegalization of slavery would mean these workers had to be compensated. This would place a new burden on plantation owners and others that had slaves. This WAS a serious economic disadvantage for the south because all of the sudden more than  people were about to enter into the paid workforce in the next  years This was not in the souths best interest and thus they had to fight the civil war. Ok your turn please tell me what the south was fighting for if not for slavery. ,houston,cq6ob0c,6,t5_2qj1l

Honestly I am living my American dream here and not a day goes by where I think Wow! I am living in America and am so thankful for it. Having said that I feel Houston could clean up downtown a fair bit. I know its hard but the homeless issue is a real problem. When I first got here I thought downtown was the epicenter of Houston and the place to be but the sheer amount of homeless and lack of things to do in downtown needs work on. Obviously I know this has already been talked about before and a lot of people share this frustration too. Even on a Sunday morning at am I go to Downtown to get on the Metro to go to Texans games. Im ft and quite big built but even I get real nervous with the sheer amount of dodgy looking people hanging around main street... in broad daylight.Anyways sorry for rambling on but I really feel this is a big issue.

4178130,0,t3_38o5se,Generally I like to support local as much as I can. Restaurants coffee shops mechanics the whole deal but our local mom and pop music stores are bad or they are for a niche market.For you the options would be Rockin Robins or Evans Music City. Both who have lackluster service and in my experience dont take kindly to people who dont know their way around a guitar. When I was shopping for a vintage amp Rockin Robins had a  Marshall that I wanted to try out. After asking to try it out I was met with hesitation and was told to keep it down while testing a   Watt amplifier. On top of that the person helping me gave me the lowest possible end Epiphone Les Paul to try after I had directly asked for a Gibson or higher end double humbucker because its what I owned. Evans Music City seems like a haven for aging cover band musicians to have a day job or disgruntled original musicians to make cash. Their service is pretty inadequate and you dont ever feel welcomed.The decent shops in town are the niche market ones. Infinity Guitars on Westheimer has some amazing boutique gear and theres a vintage shop here as well.I would recommend the Guitar Center on Westheimer and Dunvale. The company gets a rep as being this big box retail chain with no soul but every location varies and Ive never been let down by the service or selection there...,houston,crwifnj,2,t5_2qj1l

4374765,0,t3_3b4ka6,Monday I found three kittens living in a hole underneath my boyfriends parents drivewayfence his mom confirmed theres a couple of stray cats who hang out in their yard sometimes so it looks like thats where they came from. Were guessing theyre about  weeks old but we have no idea. No one has seen either of the suspected parents in a while so we have no idea how long these kittens have been living on their own out here.I am coordinating with their next door neighbor who has been helping out with feeding them every day and is currently working on trapping them. Theres three kittens two black one orange. Not sure of the sex of any of them as I havent been able to get close enough to them to pick them up. The neighbor has caught two of them and is working on getting the third now. She says they are trembling and very scared but not hissing or growling at herthey are very sweet. Aside from being very scared and hungry they seem healthy.She cant keep them my boyfriends parents dont want them and Im currently renting so we cant have more pets at our place than we already do. A friend volunteered Monday to foster them for a few days once we catch them but it looks like that has fallen through hence the post several days after finding them.We dont want to send these kittens to a shelter. All the organizations weve contacted cant take them or need someone to foster while looking for homes. Not sure what else to do... so Im posting here. Help me help these cute kitties rHouston!EDIT! UPDATE FROM NEIGHBOR  pm Thursday she just called me to let me know she took the two she caught the orange and one of the black kitties to a vet to test them for diseases and such. The vet says theyre  weeks old Im a dog person I cant judge kitten age for shit sorry! and they seem like they will make very good pets because they have such good temperament. I believe she said theyre male as well.She hasnt been able to coax the last black kitten out from the hole theyre living in we are worried that one is a lost cause at this point. She says they seem very attached to each other and worries they might not take separation well.EDIT  pm Third kitten has been caught is now at vet. The second black one is a girl kitty!EDIT  pm Friday I have tentative homes for all three kittens now but would be glad to have backups just in case someone falls through again.

4407745,0,t3_3biozv,Im a dentist and a large portion of my practice involves fixing substandard work from Mexico and Central America. Thats not to say there arent great clinicians down there but you really need to know who you are going to see and the quality of care they are going to provide you. There are also bad dentists in the US.The other problem with going there for dentalmedical care is the followup. What if something goes wrong or needs to be replaced? How easy is it for you to go back there? What about infections and postoperative complication? Just one example implants can take  mo minimum to heal before they can be restored and thats assuming no complications with the procedure. I would suggest getting a second or third opinion from licensed dentists in the state andor go to the dental school. Lastly short of an actual genetic defect with the enamel there is no such thing as soft enamel. Enamel is the hardest material in the human body. Soft enamel is cause by purely external factors including sugars acid bacteria and time. If your dentist told you she had soft teeth and doesnt know why then again I suggest you find another dentist. ,houston,csmhk8x,2,t5_2qj1l

4442095,0,t3_3bw5gn,Without breathless hyperbole both this and the Chron article are a little weak. I dont have the Harris county records in front of me. He was sentenced to deferred adjudication. To my knowledge in Texas deferred adjudication is pretty much only given in a plea deal.I should be clear that Im all for the sentiment in this thread. That said I can try to read between the lines here. A former LEO kiddy fiddler is not going to have a fun time of it in prison. I mention that not out of empathy but to point out that he has every incentive to fight at trial as though it was a capital offence.In cases like this the reason a prosecutor and judge would agree to deferred adjudication is if they think their case might fail if they dont for example put a poor abused  year old on the stand to be viciously cross examined. The reasons for that could be mishandling some aspect of the case lack of forensic evidence etc. We can rail against the judge cry corruption and all the rest...but its quite possible that this is what the family wanted. I only say possibly I dont know this case but its not unheard of. No trial and if this guy gets so much as a parking ticket in the next decade he goes down for the whole  year bid with no trial and no recourse.I point all of this out not to agree one way or another to say what is and isnt just or anything of that sort. Its simply to point out that there could be a reason good or not for this sort of outcome.Im also very interested in what the terms of his deferred adjudication are.,houston,csqm072,33,t5_2qj1l

4470011,0,t3_3c8r8m,Your best defense is that the speed limit was unlawfully set lower than allowed by law per Texas Transportation Code section .   Most likely that they didnt enter an order in the county records.  So the speed limit is the legislated prima facie speed limit set in . which is likely  mph.It will depend on a few things like the exact section of road you were on the designation of that section of road in several contexts and a few other factors.  Read all of TTC  Subchapter H to get an idea of what youll need.  The county will probably be required to prove that the change was entered in the county record and they will probably not have that proof with them.There is no effective defense for driving faster than a posted or legislated maximum speed outside of something like a medical emergency or relying on the whim of the judge.  Your dash cam video will not help unless the prosecution alleges that you were driving faster than you actually were or that there was a hazard which resulted in your speed being reckless or hazardous in that circumstance.This is a long shot but its probably your only shot.  If I were there I would just hope for a deal from the prosecutor.  I am not a lawyer.  I am definitely not your lawyer.

4687841,0,t1_ctl6dme,Sure that sounds nice and may be how it theoretically should work but people will continue scooting over at the last minute as long as there is a time advantage.  Youre just enabling them.  In your scenario more people will start cutting over from the spur lane at the last minute till we get to the same approximate equilibrium point as we have now.  It may help the second from the left lane close to the split but it will increase traffic further back because more people will use the nd to left lane to cut over.  It will also just result in the third from the left lane being cut off by a larger number of cars and the problem getting worse in the  mainlanes.Starve these people out.   Dont enable them.  Sometimes the only way to fight assholes is to be an asshole back.  Or TXDOT could just add another lane to  as it goes under  and solve this whole  northbound backup.  ,houston,ctlg2mo,1,t5_2qj1l

I was surprised to find out that because they did not consider the situation catastrophic their was very little interest without spending a very large amount of money up front money that wasnt available at the time. Theyre still doing what they can to try and at least find a solution for the medical bills owed to the hospital but its been a few years and theres not a lot of optimism unfortunately. There are times I still sit back and look at the whole situation and it just blows my mind that all of this could have been avoided if that kid just stayed off the road. Im also thankful I still have my father and for the work the paramedics nurses and doctors did for him.

4891444,0,t3_3hvxvj,We just recently bought a house in Champion Forest.  We lived in the heights previously. East Downtown before that. Montrose several years ago. So we got a good feel for the city and all that each area offers.    When it came time to buy a house I didnt feel like ponying up k for an inflated condotownhome.  We wanted a nice yard and a good neighborhood where we could walk around at night without carrying my pistol i dont miss pre gentrified East Downtown. We were looking for an area that was a suburb without feeling like a suburb.  Champion Forest was the best we found and I havent regretted it. Our house is  square feet on  of an acre and we paid less than anyone I know did for their townhome. There is so much to do in this area with the  restaurants and mall along with Vintage Parks amenities.  My office is in Memorial so my commute consists of taking the beltway every day.  Traffic can be terrible if you leave late somedays but as long as you are on the road by  then you will be fine.  Overall my drive increased about  minutes from living in the heights and I am happy with our decision.Sorry for the formattingwording...I typing on my phone.,houston,cub3t4a,16,t5_2qj1l

4931992,0,t3_3igdkc,This is good news sort of.  Schlumberger laid off quite a few workers earlier this year as did many other services companies.  I think a lot of us thought this indicated the beginning of an oil recession in town.  Some people though believed that the oil price drop wasnt as big a surprise for the big dogs this time and they were prepared for it and were going to use this as a time to make acquisitions.   This indicates that it may be true at least for Schlumberger.   Now I say this is sort of good news because in reality this will probably result in more layoffs which sucks and is unlikely to being new jobs any time soon unless they relocate a bunch of Cameron positions to houston if they arent already here.But the upshot is that Schlumberger at least wasnt entirely caught with their pants down when this drop happened.,houston,cug7t23,4,t5_2qj1l

5123355,0,t3_3l6fxn,Most apartments want you to make X your rent which is about  in your case so thats no big deal. Lots of apartments Ive seen include water in your rent and  for gas seems a bit high if you even need it.My old apartment in Montrose currently rents for month was watertrash included and had electric appliances for everything. Electricity was month in cooler months and  in warmer months. This was for a ish sq ft  bedroom with vaulted ceilings. My gf is actually moving out of her largeish studio apartment in Montrose. Great complex and its only month. Would knock off a big chunk out of your rent. Does have semiusable internet water and covered parking included. So yeah go with a cheaper but good apartment and you can knock off month easily on your estimate. Also I would recommend going to full coverage insurance on your car.

By the time a version of Windows  designed for devices like comes out most people will be using Windows .

Special interests involved in freewayautooil construction and development have a choke hold on Houston the state of Texas and the feds.We need to spend a mere  billion on heavy rail commuter lines out all of the interstate corridors and be done with it...instead of having to spend  billion to widen an interstate every  years  billions and billions in maintenance.EDIT  Im also pissed that theyre proposing to demo the eado bars on st.

5368806,0,t1_cvxx2gx,I just googled searched for ideas to post on here. apparently if you are parked in your own driveway its legal but on the street is city property and might invite problems from police. unless you have a pretty good idea the neighbors wont call the cops or they rarelynever patrol there. General word of caution is to avoid private property but if you have to park there ask for permission and maybe park out of the way so youre not so visible. I have no idea if cops will still give you a hard time though if its a business they might try to ticket you for loitering or trespassing. ,houston,cvxxba6,2,t5_2qj1l

5425092,0,t3_3pae7c,Im totally for this petition and all but people have to understand the problem of parking at UH isnt entirely because of our incompetent dept but primarily because were situated near the center of a massively spread out city. A lot of students cant afford to live in the inner city so they have to drive all the way from the suburbs. Besides carpooling incentives and busesshuttles there is little UH can do because parking at UH is part of a much bigger problem which if examined is gonna take us down the rabbit hole. Its the whole traffic situation of Houston that adds to the issue. Any effective mass transit solution for the city will instantly solve the problem of traffic as well as parking at UH. Just my two cents as a current student and btw like others have said if you plan your commute right you can find parking pretty easily,houston,cw5419e,7,t5_2qj1l

5569731,0,t1_cwnezes,gt The first amendment only applies to the government restricting free speech. You miss the point with deliberate abandon.  Yes the first amendment applies to state action.  Free speech and the first amendment arent freely interchangeable terms.  One is a general principle the other is a law.  The principle undergirds the law and is broader than the law and is a strongly cherished value in modern society regardless of whether state action is involved or private actors are involved.

The police were called but said they couldnt charge Colleen because she identifies as female.The girls had to move to a smaller locker room in order to avoid Colleen. They were effectively driven out of the womens locker room by a grown man. Colleen subsequently talked to the press presented herself as the victim and compared the girls to racists.See also the Planet Fitness case the Patrick Hagan case literally beat a woman up in a bathroom Lisa Calandro and multiple women from Ft Lauderdale who just wanted to use the gym without some dude in the middle of the locker room etc.There is a long sourced list of transgender bad and threatening behavior in womens bath rooms here ,houston,cwo6wpo,-1,t5_2qj1l

5789147,0,t1_cxea44b,Sorry for the late follow up on this was worn out after the thanksgiving day festivities and driving. Basically that changes nothing. That cites the refugees in the camps immediately around syria...   The numbers i cited were from people who tried to flee. Which is more important because theyre the ones trying to leave syria and have no intention or desire to go home after things sttle down.  Id also suggest that most of the people in those camps are not the ones looking to migrate otherwise theyd be headed up to europe.  It would be nice to see what portion of the people in those camps want the syrian war to end and for them to go home vs who wants to move to a far away country. Too bad no data is available on that.How do you even vet most of these people anyways you cant exactly call the syrian government and ask them to run a background check for you. didnt one of the guys in the paris attacks have a fake syrian passportHow does the govt mean to maintain that  month vetting process and bring in  people in less than  months?  Assuming we had the manpower to start vetting k people simultaneouslywe only vet a fractional number now They wouldnt be in here until .What will happen with the incoming refugees is what will happen with the department that does the vetting for top secret clearances Well have breakdowns and we will have problems.Finally this is a meaningless gesture. There are  million displaced people right now in the world. Most of the developed countries arent exactly overflowing with empty housing.  The only real  way to fix this is fixing the problems on site.  Bussing  or  or  million of them elsewhere isnt going to fix that. Why spend money vetting people for  months instead of housing them in safe zones so you know they can stop seeking refuge once the war is over and go homeFinally  If you really really really want to resettle some people why dont we send some of them to live in chinas ghost cities. They have capacity for millions going to waste Bottom line is thisPretty much everyone understands if someone wants to GTFO of dodge when daesh rolls into town and starts chopping peoples heads off.Those people are refugees. When you swing the door for migration open too wide you end up with economic migrants rather than people looking to get out of a bad situation. If you disagree look at the situation europe created for its self.This is what I want to prevent.,houston,cxep590,0,t5_2qj1l

You try reconciling that with headlines of record profits of the oil companies and youll understand why folks are saying Good! Prices are coming down! Prices were artificially boosted by folks buying futures to hedge against a weak dollar too. . .so the little man was getting screwed left and right.And honestly oil industry wages are inflated took me three years of raises in aerospace to match my starting offer in oil.

6371699,0,t1_czdl6o0,It really does depend.  I fortunately havent been a victim of a crime other than a burglary when I lived in Montrose where the perp unscrewed the burglar bars on the back of the apartment complex I lived in.  I bought a home in a working neighborhood that is now transitioning and a lot of people think I live in the ghetto but whatever.  There are numerous burglaries in my neighborhood but it happens everywhere.  Contrary to what certain news organizations would want you to believe people who commit these crimes are not always poor or in gangs.  The situation is a lot more complex than that.And the city isnt as random as you think it is.  Youre new here so youre unaware of how the city developed and what economic and social pressures caused what happened to happen.  I personally hate the entire gated neighborhood thing because it continues to sever bonds within a community.  Literally a few blocks from where I live is what people consider dangerous territory and that pisses me off because its not as dangerous as people like to make it out to be.    I work out in that neighborhood and prefer it over to other gyms in nicer parts of town.That said people should always be vigilant regardless of where you are.  Even in safe communities that doesnt mean any bad situation would ever be prevented or that you would never find yourself in one.gt As far as fraud goes i have a hard time thinking a situation where she could use my passportvisa copy but stranger thing had happened so yeah i will definitely keep an eye out.Not trying to be harsh here but you generally dont want this information to be floated around.

6431848,0,t3_43s0f0,I lived in DC Foggy Bottom while on exchange during college. It was many years ago but I think some of the experience still holds true. I worked on the Hill and went to American. Transportation is much much worse. When I was in DC I had no need for a car. Here I couldnt get by without one and if you dont own one Id recommend it. There really arent many walkable neighborhoods. Public transport is a joke and when youre further out it becomes even worse.Its not a tourist town so you dont see people walking around with their heads craned up looking usually. Heavy traffic times will generally be during the rodeo and thats around Reliant which isnt an issue if youre working out at JSC. Weather will be pretty similar in many regards. Its probably  degrees warmer on average. Youll be used to some of the humidity. It does not get nearly as cold. Id definitely try to live near work. It really depends on what you want your priorities to be though. If you want to try the commute and live in the hipper neighborhoods Id recommend  months to start to see what you think. If you cant stand it you can then move! But keep in mind even reverse youre looking at a good drive and  S is awful.

6825765,0,t1_d0pmloj,So the big thing is that the majority of City of Houston will not be affected by storm surge because of their location. This story which I believe is just the republishing of the Probulica piece that was posted a few days ago on here discusses Houston as really the general Houston Area.   The things to be concerned about arent necessarily the effects of a hurricane on the average Houstonian but the economic consequences of a hurricane of a certain strength that hits in a certain area due to the damage to refineries in the ship channel and then also the general infrastructure including homes in communities around Galveston Bay.  So someone living in West U shouldnt necessarily be nervous about the direct effects of storm surge on their home but from a regional perspective there could be serious consequences.,houston,d0q004w,8,t5_2qj1l

6862104,0,t1_d0tgtyk,lol Well its like this Fancy Restaurants with their own parking lot  They almost always hire and pay a Valet company to provide complementary valet parking usually the sign says so for which you tip a few bucks just as you do a bartender.  Depending on the valet company and how much average tips are given the driver either gets a low salary and keeps the tips or decent salary and turns the tips in and either the tips are pooled in from lesser busy contracts or the owner keeps it and gives out a bigger than minimum wage salary.  Should you do it? If you have a nicer car and are on a date? Sure. Dont want to? There is usually free self parking. Hotels Usually have their own inhouse valet with a set price  or whatever per night or  for event or whatever and the drivers get minimum wage plus tips...Again just tip a couple of bucks. Should you do it? I never do because its highway robbery what they charge for something that should be free. Gentlemens Clubs The valet company either works strictly off tips or has to PAY to be there. There is usually an unspoken  minimum for standard service and if you tip  youll be parked up front. Depending on the area thats well worth the price so people dont jack with your car and youre not a target of a robbery. A lot of them have car detailing too if you havent blown all your money on Simone. Straight up nasty strip clubs Youll pay for self parking and like it or your car will have a  chance of getting broken into.  Pay more to park up front.Trendy Night Clubs and bars You want to show off that k car you bought with your fancy OampG job out of college while you get bottle service?  Minimum  for VIP spots and regular valet is whatever they say it is.  Clubs arent charities and nobody is working till  am and dealing with drunk douchebags for free so unless its in an area with street parking or parking garages thats how it goes and sometimes in limited parking valets maximize space by double or triple parking.  Dont like it?  Well thats why they have cabs. Weddings at a hall Its usually paid for as a package to the venue by the wedding party and its strictly optional to tip or not tip. Tips usually go in a pool and a percentage is given to the runners andor the owner.  Often there is not enough parking spaces so again those valets maximize the parking and well worth it.special political events in the middle of the suburbs without any actual parking spots and angry old people Complete shit show still have nightmares about it over a decade later. Other notesIf you had valuables in your car and you never should check it before you leave.  If you come back the next day and say your cell phoneweedgun etc. is gone itll be your word against theirs.  Better yet give the valets a valet key that doesnt give them access to the trunk.Check your car for dents BEFORE you leave.  A good valet might actually point out a dent before hand.  Actually a good valet knows the regulars and can drive pretty much any car ever made without riding the clutch. Realize that valets have a hard job with a lot of responsibility so if you dont want to valet dont take it out on them or try to steal the spots that they cover.  In busy locations dont think for a second that if the valet hadnt conned off the spots that it would just be all open spots for everybody.  Chances are theyd be full too and you still couldnt get free parking. Nobody is forcing you to go to a place and there are usually other self parking options.  ,houston,d0u4nxw,2,t5_2qj1l

Edit actually with it being spring break those might all be filled also Im trying to find time to get back out there before it gets to damn hot myself. As far as safety youll be fine there will be families and boy scout troops all over the place and as far as critters just make sure to shake your footwear and clothes out before putting them on and keep your eyes open for snakes when walking around and you should be pretty good.Make sure to bring water.Typed on mobile probably errorsEdit Also to arrive early when the park reaches capacity they only let people enter as others exit and on busy weekendsholidays it can reach capacity within an hour or two of being open and the line to get in can be miles long. Ive always been in line as the park opens but have heard plenty of horror stories.Edit Last edit I think. If you just wank to get outside with your dog and enjoy some piece and quiet I would recommend the Loanstar hiking trail north of Houston. Here is a map with the trail on it and parking areas highlighted    Its definitely not as pretty as Enchanted Rock but it is also a lot quieter and you usually only see someone else ever hour or so. You can set up camp anywhere along the trail and just enjoy time in the woods with your dog. Love taking my dogs backpacking out there and then setting up an off trail campsite and practicing some bushcraft under the stars with a nice fire. ,houston,d10sxcr,1,t5_2qj1l

7093253,0,t1_d1josjd,The only downside of taking all your core classes at a CC is that it will probably not adequately prepare you for your upper division engineering or geology courses at a tierI university. I was fortunate to go to a great university but also took a few CC classes because I knew it would be much easier to do well in the classes. I wouldnt say that I learned very much in those classes... There is a definite difference in the quality of the classes between a CC and a university. Sometimes its not just about getting credit for the class. Its one thing if its for classes like EnglishLiterature or History that you may rarely use as an engineer or geologist in the future but Id stay away from it for your core math and science classes unless its the only way you can pay for your education. For the most part hard work trumps all of this stuff but not everyone who is in their late teens to early twenties is willing to work hard.,houston,d1ke0t2,1,t5_2qj1l

But theoretically if we did nothing about prejudice establishments that allows them to keep popping up. When you discriminate a minority its not that big of a deal because you could potentially still have a lot of white people who will go to this club.

7172833,0,t1_d1tfzti,Its like a lot of things.Folks only see the negatives  rarely do you see people appreciating things when everything goes right.When we signed up for Comcast in the Heights we spent about  solid weeks with terrible strongweakgone  intermittent service.  I actually signed up for Comcast Business at the house since it was  days free no obligation.  Man that ROCKED.  They ran a huge coax to the house and I was getting perfect service while my roomies still had sucky service.  I let them on my wifi and we kept complaining about the lack of reliability on the residential hookup.Four service callstechnicians later FINALLY the right guy found that the problem was in the box down the street.  Theyd connected our internet to a cableTV connection that was their explanation  as a technician I dont think thats spoton and once they figured that out service was very reliable for the year and a half that I lived there.  I cancelled the business setup before the  days was up and had no charge at all.  The cool thing about the business setup is it isnt that much more than residential but you get guaranteed  hour response time if youre down for ANY reason.  Their customer service call center management does leave a lot to be desired at Comcast.  As with most callcenters you may get someone in the Philippines or India.  You might get someone who really knows their stuff and get satisfaction in minutes or you may have to go through a supervisor and STILL barely be able to communicate.If I could pay a little more and have a company that guarantees their callcenter is in the USA staffed by people who speak English clearly and are of at least average intelligence you can bet that would be who Id hire for any service I can both at at home and at the office. ,houston,d1thf6u,0,t5_2qj1l

7203758,0,t3_4e4eey,Getting a dog may very well assist with anxiety issues.  However depending on what you mean by physically assist you in the event of a medical problem you may need a trained medical service dog.  This is not the sort of training you can do yourself since you said you havent owned a dog before.  If this is the sort of canine you need look for specialized organizations that do this sort of training.And as another commenter has noted you probably dont want a GSD as your first dog unless it has already been trained.  They are an immense handful and require some very strict discipline training and exercise.  Having seen some poorlytrained GSD nightmares I recommend starting with calmer preferably smaller breeds.  There are still larger breeds that arent as crazy as GSDs if thats your preference golden retrievers labrador retrievers etc. although they can be pretty active dogs too... just not nearly as nutty as GSDs.  For specific breeds there are breed specific rescues for just about any breed located nearby.,houston,d1x0d5l,5,t5_2qj1l

And city officials and members of the booster class hardly want stricter regulation on where and how to build  because hey we want to attract business and dont want to lose it to Dallas.Here in Dallas we have the same problem and it might be worse. See Houstons fresh water largely comes from east of the city in the rivers and lakes. Dallas draws its water from lots of large reservoirs all over which are boxed in by creaky old dams  which are under strain during heavy rains and the pronounced risk of flooding ... exacerbated by all the pavement.But try convincing city officials to reign in the sprawl. Not happening ... because then business would move to Houston.,houston,d2a0p0k,9,t5_2qj1l

Every time a new building is built or an old one substantially renovated it will be built or rebuilt raised. No property remains a slum forever. Neighborhoods go through cycles some rising some falling. It will take decades but eventually the great bulk of the citys housing stock can be converted to raised structures. Then  years from now if there are some small minority of units say  is left unraised due to the neglect of slumlords you just declare the decrepit buildings unfit for human habitation condemn them and tear them down.,houston,d2e0hlk,8,t5_2qj1l

If you put water on molten titanium it basically explodes.The medium potential for harm tier does feature lead acid battery locations. The researchers at Texas AampM relied on the Tier  chemical inventories filed with local emergency planning committees to know what chemicals were on site. We relied on the AampM evaluation of the chemicals to decide which group each facility landed in. For medium potential for harm places with lead acid batteries the chemicals sulfuric acid were listed in enough quantity to get that score from AampM.

The address I moved from in June of last year.When I called and spoke to someone they said that they mailed me a letter saying such. I asked when she said in October. I asked why they waited  months to contact an address they knew I didnt live at she got angry I got angry everyone was yelling.I managed to get  in administration fees waived and still paid .THEN I FOUND OUT OFFICER DICK BAG WROTE TWO CITATIONS NOT ONEOne for having an expired toll tag and another for being behind on payments.I almost lost it in traffic court when they told me they could only waive one of the tickets.I was told I could attempt to appeal in both courts.Both courts? you ask. Yes. Both. Because EZTag has their own court that can supplement Harris County and as Ive learned often give a judgement that sticks. But they arent the law! you exclaim.

For the most part standard HO or HOA policies will have sublimits on cash and jewelrywatchesfurs of a couple thousand.  Like  to  not nearly enough.  Any thing above that you need to schedule each individual item with the insurance company complete with purchase receipts or appraisals in their file for it to be covered.  Not an option with cash though they have a limit and thats that.What you can take away from this is dont keep massive amounts of cash in a safe at home.

Without Bill signing that into law there would have been no United States v Windsor that struck down DOMA and no Obergefell v Hodges that drew from that decision because gay marriage would have been prohibited by the constitution. Both supreme court judges appointed by Bill voted in the majority in both cases by the way.The whole reason Dont Ask Dont Tell was even a thing was that Bill Clinton was trying to remove the complete ban on even closeted U.S. service members.Hillary herself supported civil unions long before they were popular. It wasnt exactly a profile in courage but it was the best we had.They were compromises made in a country thats hard to imagine now. This issue has moved so fast. The amount of revisionism people engage in when it comes to the Clintons is staggering. Or at least would be if every issue wasnt twisted to advance an agenda.I voted for Bernie I hoped hed win. When my candidate lost I didnt become a fucking Nihilist or accelerationist or whatever and decided to vote for the greater evil or else not vote against him.I dont want to see the harm that was meted out to Atlantic City dealt to the whole country.

I said no the first time and found myself in the middle between a linebacker sized dude and a mom with a baby. Turns out they fill the middle rows up first if you say no. Teach your ass a lesson.

I dont mind sharing it with you if you want it. We had more people than you closer to  so some of the venues that you might consider were automatically ruled out as too small. Here are some of the cheaper options we considered thoughcommunity centers these are super cheap and could be spruced up if you have the energy to decorate. they do book up early though so its not necessarily the thing youll be able to get with short notice. By far the cheapest option though.Last Concert CafeAvant GardenNouveau Antique Art BarEldorado BallroomWarehouse LiveFifty two twenty six  ElmAwesome if you have booze covered. Thats a big expensealthough some places will require you to use their bar. Caterers can also be really expensive so finding a venue that will allow outside food is really important. We had our wedding at Warehouse Live and they were so awesomeso great to work with. Id recommend them to anyone. For food we had a taco carttaquisa parked right outside. It was so good and cheap.

Unfortunately the  location isnt quite the city center but if a big walkable district can be built around it the BRT line is finished to connect it to Uptown and perhaps someday the GreenPurple line can be extended out there it could work.Light rail wont work to IAH its too far out.  Commuter rail could work though.  And Metro tried an express bus and it failed due to lack of interest.Thankfully the  station doesnt preclude a downtown station as well.  They could always build that as a second Houston station.

8383415,0,t1_d5pgle5,Im certainly in favor of reducing officerinvolved shootings.  Very much so.  All law enforcement officers are trained in handling mentally ill subjects.  Obviously some academies afford morebetter training than others and unfortunately some officers will be more receptive to the training than others.Dealing with mentally ill people is something many officers encounter and shootings only happen in a relatively small number of cases.  Now I do have to say that ANY shooting of a mentally ill person is one too many.  A lot of times officers are able to use a beanbag gun that will knock a man down with relatively minor injuries.  Sometimes they can use pepper spray or tear gas.  Sometimes they can use a taser.  But sometimes the only option an officer feels he has is to shoot the suspect before he hurts or kills someone.  When you say lots of things could be done but wont why do you think they wont?  Theres been huge progress made in this area in law enforcement.  There was a time when there was no training included on dealing with mentally challenged individuals.  There was a time when officers didnt have tasers or other lessthanlethal options.  There has been progress.  But yeah unfortunately some officers still feel like they dont have a choice and in some cases theyll be found negligent.  Some will even go to jail some will lose their jobs and license as an officer.  But some will be exonerated because a review of circumstances will show that they made the right decision.,houston,d5ph48a,1,t5_2qj1l

Stick to those constructs while you are in the city and be sure to check out landmarks like the Strand or East End Historic District.

The cop went on to read the guard the riot act and let him know that we could press assault charges in this situation. He also let him know we have  foot from the street which is city property regardless of what stone the sidewalk is paved with. Probably helped that I am in my s and sober at the time.

Said that Mom and Dad sent her to rehab a couple of times in her Junior year for smoking weed and then lied to everyone about her whereabouts in order to save face had a whole psych work up done on her yada yada...Seems to me that she is living a life that her parents either cant or wont accept or understand.  I do not agree with her choices particularly dropping out of high school her senior year but its not illegal to make bad choices in life.  How you make the leap from this morning to human trafficking is beyond me.  Another face saving move perhaps?Regardless I think its shameful and takes away from the real HT victims and there are many.

The city cant pay better because of the pressure people like you put on it to cut costs.

In any case the figures in the link I provided show government spending as a percentage of GDP.  I am assuming that a significant portion of that spending involves salaries and government worker benefits.  Bottom line we are spending a ridiculous amount of our GDP in the government sector yet our local state and national infrastructure is crumbling and the quality of services we are getting are declining.  ,houston,d7drh5a,1,t5_2qj1l

The manufacturer warranty doesnt lock you down to a single dealer. If its stalling and running rough it doesnt sound like that serious of an issue in terms of what the fix may be but can be hard to trace when its intermittent. It sounds ignition andor fuel related like a dying fuel pump or coil pack which can be really hard to diagnose definitively when the part hasnt completely failed unless they just start throwing new parts which they really wont do unless the customer is footing the bill.Next time it happens take a video try filming the tachometer and roll the windows down and try to pick up how the car sounds when its idling. Maybe even rev the motor a bit while its idling rough while recording dont mash the gas just press the pedal like youre trying to slowly accelerate.

Since then they put more stringent processes to evaluate their products for listeria and as a result are more vigilant in recalling batches that might be contaminated. In this case the product might be contaminated because of cookie dough from an outside producer.Its funny to run Blue Bell through the mud for listeria good memes I do it myself and they deserve criticism for the first outbreak where listeria was actually distributed and made people sick... but you have to be real about it now. They probably now have the strictest procedures for catching listeria of any ice cream manufacturer and are catching potential cases whereas other companies might let it slip by... but their vigilance is causing media to notice and people who dont read into it further to shy away from their product.TLDR The first incident of listeria was bad. However the subsequent recalls including this one have been a proactive approach Blue Bell has taken. They are recalling products before anyone gets sick.

Im asking for ANYTHING more than ONE person addressing a rumor.gtI guess he was just making it upWeve already been down this road before. My god. How did you forget? You LITERALLY already said this verbatim. Hahahgtbecause theres NO WAY that a constitutional amendment was being considered at a time when Republicans were doing everything they could to drive a wedge issue for an election year. How many times do you need to be told that rumors that one guy talked about one time doesnt mean anything? The ACTUAL amendment came years later under Bush. There WAS NO AMENDMENT being considered. How many times do you have to be told?You even keep saying republicans as if the Democrats didnt also oppose gay marriage. Why? gtYes politicians particularly those in vulnerable positions have to pick the lesser of two evils often as do voters.What exactly are you saying was the lesser of two issues?  gtOf course just because youre educated and privileged you think that they should take every position that you agree with at the expense of accomplishing anything or ceding power to the actual enemies. What did they accomplish by opposing gay marriage until the day SCOTUS told them to give it up? Hahaha wtf? I think they should fucking follow the constitution and defend the rights of their constituents. Are you kidding me? gtAnd then when you dont get your way you turn into a rabid crybaby. Oh I know right? I should just support them fucking me in the ass like you do all while trying to reassure myself that if they werent fucking me the evil republicans would.

When the owners said that they wouldnt make him take a test the insurer said that the company would have to fire him then because they wouldnt insure him.  The owners basically told the insurer to piss up a tree paid for the claim out of their pocket and switched insurers.  He was too valuable of an employee and they knew whatever test he would fail had nothing to do with the onthejob accident.  Thats pretty chill in my book.

The intended victim was stripped naked and then firmly fastened within the interior space of two narrow rowing boats or hollowedout tree trunks joined together one on top of the other with the head hands and feet protruding. The condemned was forced to ingest milk and honey and more honey would be poured on him to attract insects with special attention devoted to the eyes ears mouth face genitals and anus. In some cases the executioner would mix milk and honey and pour that mixture all over the victim. He would then be left to float on a stagnant pond or be exposed to the sun. The defenseless individuals feces accumulated within the container attracting more insects which would eat and breed within the victims exposed flesh whichpursuant to interruption of the blood supply by burrowing insectsbecame increasingly gangrenous. The individual would lie naked covered from head to toe in milk honey and his own feces. The feeding would be repeated each day in some cases to prolong the torture so that fatal dehydration or starvation did not occur. Death when it eventually occurred was probably due to a combination of dehydration starvation and septic shock. Delirium would typically set in after a few days.,houston,daqdx30,2,t5_2qj1l

Thought I would give some insight as someone who used to work in the NPO sector here but then sold my soul to corporate Americaoil and gas. There are several nonprofits in the greater Houston area and Im sure theres positions you would be qualified for given your nonprofit experience in DC.  However the downturn of the energyOampG economy in Houston greatly impacts nonprofits hiring and fundraising so take that into consideration.  And while your money may go further here remember that salaries are reflective of that low cost of living at least thats what Ive found.  Im sure your job in DC at the nonprofit for k reflects that high cost of living.  In Houston that type of salary could probably be equivalent more to k.  But theres always exceptions.

The article is sourced  it contains links to back everything stated in it. Suffrage was never a gendered issue. Feminists falsely portrayed it as such. There were tons of radical feminists that partnered with AfricanAmericans to agitate for Civil Rights. Your argument is either moving the goalposts or a nonsequiter depending on what youre trying to achieve with it. If youre trying to redirect the conversation to racism its moving the goalposts since youre replying to a comment about wrongly gendering the suffrage movement with a comment about a totally unrelated issue. If youre trying to redeem the suffragettes with claims that they fought racism dont bother. Stantons racismSuffragette White SupremacyDid violence get women the voteWomen as dictators Suffragette female supremacySuffragettes were no angels. I blame the corporate media for spotlighting bourgeois feminists like Gloria Steinem who are preaching a lifestyle feminism at the expense of an inclusive and classconscious feminism.This too has nothing to do with the discussion at hand... but even if it did its bullshit. Claiming feminists who have had no influence on law and policy should factor more into peoples opinion on feminism than do the feminists who have been informing law and policy for  years is irrational.

10003774,0,t1_dbbek47,Yeah thats how dogwhistles can be such effective propaganda tools. The archetypal American example comes from Ronald Reagan who opened his presidential campaign with a speech that included the followinggtI believe in states rights.... I believe we have distorted the balance of our government today by giving powers that were never intended to be given in the Constitution to that federal establishment.On the face it it hes making a reasonable if somewhat arcane point about constitutionality and the balance of power between the federal government and the states. But in the context of a speech given in rural Mississippi to an allwhite audience after the passage of the  Civil Rights Act hes implying that states should be allowed to reject federal desegregation initiatives and the civil rights movement in general. gtEverybody watching the  campaign knew what Reagan was signaling at the fair. Whites and blacks Democrats and Republicans  they all knew. The news media knew. The race haters and the people appalled by racial hatred knew. And Reagan knew.gtHe was tapping out the code. It was understood that when politicians started chirping about states rights to white people in places like Neshoba County they were saying that when it comes down to you and the blacks were with you.,houston,dbbiqtn,16,t5_2qj1l

10023625,0,t3_5j7xpu,From San Diego my extended family still lives there.The work ethic seems to be vastly different.  Houston is a city of driven young professionals who then have . kids and move to the burbs.  Oil and gas and health care are king.  My SD cousins seem more content to work their  hrs a week and sneak out early every day to go surf.  They dont have much of a concept of art or good music. Weather is laughable but just remind yourself that you are burning twice the calories when you run in  F and  humidity.  What was an easy  miles between Mission and PB and back you can accomplish in  miles.Inner Houston is fun but the entire city comes with its compromises. Houston traffic is closer to LA than SD but still not as bad as LA.  Although maybe  by the Galleria?  Rent is cheaper but its all relative.  Its a big city and Montrose heights or downtown living can get expensive.  Im sure youre used to having a losing football team.  Nothing new there.Im partial to this one  knowing San Diegos craft beer scene.  Houston is getting there.  We have some up and coming talent in this city.Houston pride is a big thing.  We love our city in spite of itself.  You can find many reasons to hate Houston if you try but we really try not to.Hope this helps.

I simply stated that asking on a public domain for a church with specific demographics might lend itself to criticism.  Needing to ask that question might lead others to believe its hard to find such a church in west Houston which if Houston is as diverse as we keep repeating it is and the church community should reflect that diversity then it shouldnt be that difficult.  To say that there is difficulty in finding it in west Houston is to express that the christian community in west Houston is segregating itself so much so that one looking for a mixedethnicity church would require querying this subreddit.

Then point out that even among plans with an identical pricing structure base charge  one rate no TDU pass through TriEagle still isnt even the cheapest plan. Theres this plan by Pioneer Energy that has an . cent rate rather than an . cent rate and no base charge rather than a . base charge. In other words the TriEagle plan is worse in every state of the world as this graph showsThat is youre probably overpaying compared to that plan by roughly  per month and thats not even the cheapest plan you could have selected given your usage. Instead of asking to be allowed out of the contract Id just ask for a  credit or something. Itd still mean youre overpaying but not by as much. They might worry about the bad publicity enough to do that. Its kind of a long shot but Id say its worth a try.Edit Oh yea and feel free to mention our website if you think itd help your cause.

Its been years since Ive had direct experience with these schools but in the past they had degreed experienced teachers. I would also encourage you to look at other Methodist churches besides St. Lukes. Most Methodist programs are accredited by NAEYC National Association for the Education of Young Children. The Methodists also have their own yearly conference for their schools to provide education and training.Collaborative for Children has a search feature for finding programs in the area. All licensed programs will be listed. You should be able to see what is available in your area. I did a search using my address. I had to search by child care centers as opposed to preschools to find the types of programs that you are probably looking for. A preschool search mostly showed the programs at elementary schools.

In the term sheets future COLAs were frozen for some retirees for three years and then tied to Social Securitys COLA adjustment. But in this bill the COLA is set to  below the pension plans investment return. Over the last ten years the plans have averaged about .. If that trend continues this provision would virtually wipe out COLA adjustments for all retirees. While the current COLA provisions are unrealistic and need to reworked this provision would dramatically impact older retirees especially those who retired prior to the big runup in pension benefits at the end of the Lee Brown administration.I agree theres a lot of bad ideas in Turners plan but weve coddled retirees for far too long especially public sector retirees and theres nothing wrong with asking them to tighten their belts a little.,houston,ddtq3dz,4,t5_2qj1l

Weve done winery tours elsewhere Messina Hof and Haik Winery though Messina Hof does have a winery in Fredericksburg so we just went for tastings.I would definitely hit a winery that does a tasting tour if youve never done it theres a lot of good info remember to taste dry to sweet otherwise dries become unbearable. And plan meals there are a ton of wineries in a short distance so be sure to eat real food and not just crackers.We took around  for purchasing tastings and bottles. Our list was . Cellars Grape Creek they have a small restaurant and then the trio at the Fiesta plot Fiesta was our favorite and there are two additional cellars on the same plot. And then the next day we did Fredericksburg winery and the chocolate shop that uses their wines.I would say one tour early and then just tastings. The original Messina Hof does a pretty good tour so I would recommend theirs. I would avoid the cellars and go strictly to wineries the three on one were the killer of our weekend take your time between and feel free to ask your tenders for their recommendations.

11464050,0,t1_dfvelhb,Elevated on pylons may not appease many of the farmersranchers complaining about the high speed rail.  Even though it would presumably require a narrower ROW than rail I think Texas Central wants  feet rail would also be elevated across the vast majority of the route to allow traffic and animals and people to go underneath it as well.If advances can be made in boring technology that indeed would be the game changer that could make this happen sooner.Highspeed maglev needs a  mile turning radius.  The Hyperloop will go at twice the speed so Id assume the radius would have to be quite a bit bigger.  But moving that underground would completely eliminate that problem.However that does expose a totally different problem specific to Texas and a few other places.  Texas has a tremendous number of abandoned oil wells and many of them are not well mapped due to being so old.  You cant just tunnel through an area until you know there isnt a well on your path and if you hit a well you need to be able to plug it immediately.  That could make boring a tunnel between Texas cities unfeasible even if new technology makes it affordable in other places.I could definitely see the UAE being the first to do it just like Shanghai was the first to do highspeed maglev a few years ago.  Unfortunately something that works in a relatively small area by a government that doesnt mind throwing lots of money at something may not work in a different place much like there arent going to be any highspeed maglev lines of any reasonable length for another decade or more.  I do hope to see Hyperloop in my lifetime but Im not optimistic.,houston,dfvfyn0,6,t5_2qj1l
