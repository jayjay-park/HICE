5016297,0,t1_cuq0dma,I tried to touch on the educationfamily relationship in my post as well I liked that there was a clear conclusion based directly from the data thats part of what makes research so valuable. Without studies like this we could really only make guesses as to the many reasons adults are getting married but with a good research design and trustworthy data we are much better equipped to identify variables which make an impact on our decision making. Armed with solid information we can then have more productive discussions!,VTHD2304Fall2015,cuqnk23,1,t5_39mgo
5091027,0,t1_cuxvor4,I totally know what you mean. I feel I lean right but swing left and I found it somewhat offensive. While I realize that he wasnt insulting me personally I still just didnt like it as a whole. Like you I think if he had been a little more positive overall like I felt the Jay Smooth talk was then he would be able to impact a larger audience. I did however like how Tim Wise opened his talk. It made him seem more humble and was the perfect way to introduce the topic he was addressing in a clever unique way. ,VTHD2304Fall2015,cuznsq9,1,t5_39mgo
5129375,0,t1_cv414la,The Alternative World video definitely made me think as well. It is sad how people who are simply different are treated with disgust. As a Christian I do not support homosexuality yet it is not my place to judge anyone and certainly not right to treat people who identify as anything other than heterosexual any differently. It was interesting seeing the role reversal of the video and opened my eyes to how hard some lives can be. ,VTHD2304Fall2015,cv4a5py,1,t5_39mgo
5188715,0,t1_cv9ie9s,I agree that dating does not necessarily means marriage.  Even though marriage is traditional and most people do get married sometimes I think people do get married because it is the normal thing to do.  For some people dating instead of getting married works for them.  They can still live together have kids together and support each other without being bound by marriage.  Sometimes I think people feel obligated at a certain point in his or her life which can lead to fighting and possibly divorce if both partners are not all in.,VTHD2304Fall2015,cvbfi51,1,t5_39mgo
5221530,0,t1_cv92nt3,I think most people would like to believe the fairy tale prince charming and that if they are the prince charming there will be a princess for them. The fact of the matter is that somebody could seem like a prince charming or a princess to someone and the complete opposite to someone else. This could be because of baggage how they were raised how the other person was raised both peoples sense of humor and so on. This essentially is compatibility. I think you only consider someone your prince charming if the two of you are compatible otherwise they are just some other person or some other jerk.,VTHD2304Fall2015,cvfdwy7,1,t5_39mgo
5312139,0,t1_cvphqe2,I really love your viewpoint on this topic! You made a lot of good points that I agree with immensely. I would feel very uncomfortable for my LTSO to have the authority to take me off life support. I feel like since I have been by my familys side since day one that they should have the authority to make drastic decisions like that. Cohabiting as an unmarried couple is definitely something that I dont entirely agree with and you made an awesome statement as to why. With so many shared belongings it could be difficult to divide them among the couple if something happened for the relationship to fall apart. Lastly I totally agree with you that only married couples should be given equal rights versus unmarried couples. Marriage comes with many benefits and also some disadvantages. So if the couple is not able to take their relationship to the next level they would not receive the same benefits as well. ,VTHD2304Fall2015,cvqorup,1,t5_39mgo
5447131,0,t1_cw6ouyy,There are many such support groups. One such example are RESOLVE groups. They focus on infertility but also have space for people to talk about things like miscarriage and stillbirth. Thats a list of available groups in Virginia.  The reason you and Id guess many others havent heard about them is because of how taboo the idea of infertility miscarriages etc. still is. It makes people uncomfortable but also stirs up peoples sense that having children is the endallbeall and therefore stirs judgment.,VTHD2304Fall2015,cw7x9hx,1,t5_39mgo
5573179,0,t1_cwnrztp,Child abuse is a very scary thing to think about I agree. For how important healthy development is for a child growing up with such an environment is unimaginable. I am too very fortunate to grow up the way I did with the support system I had. I respect all those who have gotten through unfortunate childhoods and are thriving in their current lives.,VTHD2304Fall2015,cwnwkhe,1,t5_39mgo
5816348,0,t1_cxas1wn,The video was humorous and definitely raised a point! In todays time I feel like the younger generation relies on technology as I spend hours on my labtop checking emails texting and on social media each and every day.  My grandma just recently got a labtop and it is crazy to me how she difficult it is for her to do a basic task such as look up something simple on Google.  Since our generation has always seemed to be tech savy and it is only increasing I think we will be quite different as we get older.  Although we may not end up being in line with the latest technology of the future we will at least have a basis and experience with technology that our older generations did not necessarily have. ,VTHD2304Fall2015,cxi2m57,1,t5_39mgo
5836422,0,t3_3ty6rr,One of the revelations that occurred to me while reading this weeks material was how much all the weeks topics were connected to one another. I know this might sound silly since since all the topics had come from the study of families. This week it hit just mow much they are all connected. While reading the slides about merged families I thought about what would happen if communication a weeks topic wasnt as clear as it needed to be. What if a step parent started to cross boundaries with a child and started to emotional or even physically abuse them a weeks topic? What if there was an underling privilege a weeks topic with in the step of half siblings? For example maybe one half of the family moved into the other families home. The children might see it as I am in charge or I can do what I want because this is MY home not yours. For some reason this week really showed me how all of these potentially major problems could be seen in complex or regular families.  ,VTHD2304Fall2015,cxkok8b,1,t5_39mgo
