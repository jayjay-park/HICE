152342,0,t3_1u1aow,Theres some hints by Peter Collingridge on how to run the KA CS programs which are a remix of javascript and processing.js with some boiler plate removed. See Running Khan Academy programs on your computer,Khan,cevs7ew,2,t5_2qr78

Quality content that achieves that goal is what Khan is about. They should always be improving their materials.,Khan,cf7wjya,1,t5_2qr78
278684,0,t3_1x9pos,Well I can give you the legitimate reason. And maybe fix it at some later date. PAtm the way the dashboard is updated via the dashboards cache and the way tutorialmode is updated via the tutorials cache are different. The real question is why it happens in the first place and why it happens only to some small subset. Based on the code its likely a race condition on the first go when you complete the exercise for the first time two things try to update the cache at roughly the same time and the first gets overwritten by the second. And then after that the way its styled is never updated again because it doesnt think it ought to.Your IFTHEN suggestion would certainly work but it requires exposing it to the dashboards cache altogether which could be slow and gives a lot of unused information and then changing the way it is displayed after the fact but quicker than a human could notice. Alternatively we could either a fix the underlying problem b hack together a quick solution somewhere before it is displayed and call the most uptodate completion status which isnt too time expensive for a couple exercises or c circumvent the problem in some meaningful way.I spent a couple hours on this bug this morning and a and c werent immediately doable for me and b makes code unmanageable and I couldnt purposively replicate the problem so I couldnt even test if the hack would fix it or not. However we occasionally have hackathons for bugs like this and Ill put this on the thingstofix list.This happens on my account too and it really is annoying!,Khan,cf9ncd8,2,t5_2qr78

1071024,0,t1_chpo13o,Im sorry I didnt think of the fact that programming challenges and mastery challenges have the same name. I have had this happen to me multiple times I start a programming challenge. Later on when I try to restart I get the pinwheel of doom. ,Khan,chq1347,1,t5_2qr78

1574204,0,t1_cjcuw7g,Its true that when you have a near chance of getting a question right when you know the skill associated with that question it doesnt make much sense to ask you those questions! However if you arent perfect at a skill you can always improve from some more practice or review. In a real school as youve called it students are usually advanced to new topics even when they have not mastered the topics which need to be mastered which results in a really poor understanding of the new material. At Khan Academy we believe that students should always build on solid foundations which is why we encourage review and give review problems in mastery challenges.,Khan,cjdlnd8,2,t5_2qr78
1663726,0,t3_2dc0a6,Youre right this is a badlywritten question. Weve removed it from the site for the time being and will make it less ambiguous before putting it back up.,Khan,cjovhu3,3,t5_2qr78
1667972,0,t1_cjpehq1,Hmm I wonder if its trouble with the exercises framework in general or maybe just the fancy math typesetting in particular. Do exercises without that fancyfont math perform reasonably well?,Khan,cjper96,2,t5_2qr78
1862980,0,t1_ckdahr7,Khan uses gamification  and badges to encourage people to do more than they would without those incentives. If the feeling becomes x is worthless because a bunch of people who didnt work to attain it  it cheapens the accomplishment and the strength of the gamification becomes weaker and children learn less.  keeping the integrity of the points badges is important and keeps kids aspiring to get that black hole badge one day ,Khan,ckdomgk,1,t5_2qr78
