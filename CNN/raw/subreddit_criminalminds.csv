957376,0,t3_225i50,I didnt care for Blake in the very beginning but once she and Reid became pals I really warmed up to her. Seeing her at home with her husband helped humanize her too. So many hs in one sentence?! Of course learning that Blakes husband is also the husband from Switched at Birth was interesting. Im waiting for the crossover episode where they reveal its the same guy and hes a bigamist. ,criminalminds,chd41wd,3,t5_2sv0q

2394548,0,t3_2mu22p,There are so many that I love.My and probably everyone elses favourite remark ever in criminal minds is this one from It takes a Village SE by ReidAnother one by Rossi to Straus which I like.

3776508,0,t1_cqmlo17,I thought it was okay in terms of trying to be scary. Ive watched enough horror to figure out the ending so it wasnt much of a surprise for me. What really ruined it for me was the kid. Just beyond unbearable. I mean good on him because thats what he was supposed to do but man it was too much for me. I couldnt empathize with him. ,criminalminds,cqmr01k,1,t5_2sv0q
3815168,0,t1_cqr110u,Much to my surprise I actually liked Ted Danson in CSI.

4342046,0,t3_3aqrb8,I dont really have any insight on Elles departure but the writers hands were pretty much tied with Gideons because of the hasty exit Mandy Patinkin chose to make.  They had to find a way to write him off quickly which is why it probably seems sloppy.Like you I wasnt a huge Prentiss fan at first but she did grow on me.  Shes a bit clumsy in her interactions with the team at first but she integrates much better with time.  I cant really tell you if its worth your time to continue watching but I think there are a lot of quality episodes in later seasons.  ,criminalminds,csf2v4v,3,t5_2sv0q

5460279,0,t3_3psjvg,I agree. I was watching last nights episode and I just couldnt get into it. Two alpha males? Thats your plot? It definitely was a weaker episode. Although the bride killer episode was very well done to me. Props to the writers for that one.,criminalminds,cw9lp3u,5,t5_2sv0q
5464709,0,t1_cw9lp3u,Yeah that biker episode... The only thing I could think of was one of the writers was watching Sons of Anarchy and said Lets do an episode about outlaw bikers!,criminalminds,cwa62kl,2,t5_2sv0q

Like at first they were more original and surprising. After a while you can still find some incredibly genious episodes but way more rarely than before.I mean the main reason why I weekly watch the show is because Im attached to the team and their stories and not because of the plot per se. Its still good though.,criminalminds,dfh9j1c,15,t5_2sv0q
