5898448,0,t1_cxsfcq2,I dont think it does. I didnt use Fury Brand or whichever it is called. But I did use the  Limit Break.,FinalFantasyVII,cxstjfe,1,t5_2tezb
5943588,0,t1_cxypswb,You can see a screenshot here  Its sometimes cumbersome because you have information under your fingers and trying to register clicks at the screen edges can always be a pain depending on your phone case. But it does work. It doesnt make the game unplayable but it can break your concentration ,FinalFantasyVII,cxyqg15,1,t5_2tezb

6447189,0,t1_czeh13h,Well damn.. I probably wouldnt have had to play the damn game  times to figure it out haha... ,FinalFantasyVII,czm6gxj,3,t5_2tezb
6524580,0,t1_czu6ura,Shinra Soldiers for one. There are a crapton of them in VII. Cloud has the option to fight off a ton of them in the Midgar Slums remember? Oohh...maybe they could incorporate that into the game! Also Mighty Grunt Special Combatants Sweepers Bagrisks. Only one of these is an actual army but it would still be cool with the proper direction.,FinalFantasyVII,czu6z7f,2,t5_2tezb
6533509,0,t1_czut5h6,Ah.Because normally youd be playing it on the lowerpowered PlayStation . Playing it on a higherpowered faster machine that has a lot more memory capability and whatnot should make it faster. Its kinda like how youd expect an NGC game to run faster on a Wii which incidentally it does.,FinalFantasyVII,czv480h,1,t5_2tezb
6544562,0,t1_czvtk4y,Well LVl  i think with Cloud and the others lvl  im currently in Shinra towers just got all three coupons retrieved  .  Forget whats next But everything has been a breeze up to this point. Funny my first few play thoroughs took me ages to get to the point i am now and was Challenging but i guess all my research and training paid off,FinalFantasyVII,czw9efd,1,t5_2tezb
7905969,0,t1_d44akdk,OK then good to know!Does that mod require th Heavens or is it something seperate?And I do know that but I rather want to rip it from the game itself as I technically have the music files with the game.,FinalFantasyVII,d44pfox,1,t5_2tezb
8287318,0,t1_d5db9lq,Will check when I get home! Thank you!!,FinalFantasyVII,d5dh28v,1,t5_2tezb
8839184,0,t3_5173j7,Video is unwatchable due to the shitty music. Why didnt this dude just use the ingame stuff? Much better.,FinalFantasyVII,d7acf4s,4,t5_2tezb
9268656,0,t3_5775yk,You might want to check out a youtube channel called michaelcthulhu he has a video showing how he built one think he mentions that the dimensions are a subject of debate because they change depending on if its seen in game play cut scene or the art at the start screen.Not sure if its what you are after but hope it helps.He has  build videos.OlderNewer,FinalFantasyVII,d8qv9kb,1,t5_2tezb
10155717,0,t3_5lf89x,No but I hope so  I think it would be really cool if you could go down into the cave Genesis crystal is in or if you could hear people talking about him on LOVELESS Avenue. Angeal might be harder to work in because he died pretty early on and Cloud wouldnt know much about him. But I would love if they could do it. More realistically someone might mention that Sephiroth was once relatively normal and had a couple of close friends who ditched him before he went insane. ,FinalFantasyVII,dbv7gnt,6,t5_2tezb

10579279,0,t3_5rgjh1,The summon materia you get using a Gold Chocobo is awesome and allowed me to essentially one hit the final boss if thats your thing though I was level ish last time I finished.  I didnt mind the whole rigmarole of getting a Golf Chocobo but it does take a lot of patience and money and a fair bit of time.  I lucked out by always getting the right colorsex when breeding so didnt have to retry and retry and retry like some do.  The only time I ever got it though was my last play through and I did it right before the final boss.  Like it was the last thing I did essentially.  So I dunno how beneficial it is if you do it early.Like I said the summon materia you get is awesome but it just depends on how difficult you want to the boss battles to be.  ,FinalFantasyVII,dd7656s,1,t5_2tezb
