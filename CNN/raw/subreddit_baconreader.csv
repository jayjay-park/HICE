The location of the refresh and X hide buttons is a bit challenging...depending on whether you are logged in or out.     For the toolbar expandhide button...I believe you are referring to the Fullscreen mode button.  Go to Settings and uncheck the option for Fullscreen mode.

Its intentional and Im mentioning it a so people know about that specifically and b so people are aware that this app was written in part by people who think thats a legitimate tactic.In a time like today full of apps that share more about you than you know the motives and ethics of the people who write them are significant.

882013,0,t1_ch4hvj4,No worries!  When you are trying to submit a post the Submit a Post screen has the Title field either an optional Message field or Link URL field and then the Subreddit r field.  You can either type in the subreddit name there or just tap the little triangle on the far right side and choose the subreddit you want to post it in.    Hope that helps.  Feel free to ask question re how to baconreader on this sub.  You can send me a private message as well if you need to.  ,baconreader,ch4jds3,3,t5_2sbiz

The unread messages are from  different users and theyre all comment replies. When I tap on the comments that are lit up the comments they are replying too all seem to be there. Hope that helps.

1167750,0,t1_ci0z99k,I can see there being no add maybe I clicked it away to see if it stayed without the add.Another point of reference is the quality or clarity of the small white text. Im using a .inch display I might log in on my laptop to see if the pics are actually different. The only other thing I could do is try to video it.  Might be a setting on my phone but its the only app that seems to do it and only since I went back to blue theme  might see if it happens on the black theme first. Thank you for the response.

However the reason you are crashing is that your device is running out of memory.  We have a new version coming out any day now that switches from using web view for images to an image viewer.  Hopefully that will help.    One question does this start happening after you have been in the app for a while and have viewed a lot of postsimagesgifs?,baconreader,ci4rsee,1,t5_2sbiz

Can you do the same thing I asked TheReverendWillyG to do...enable the diagnostics and send us the log.  It may be tricky if the app is crashing but give it a try.  Here are the instructions    Open the About screen   Scroll to the bottom and long press  times on the Version string.   You will see a Send logs item get added to the bottom of the list in that screen.   Back out of the About screen.   Use the app until you encounter the issue.   Return to the About Screen and tap on the Send logs item.   Put a note in it so we know what it is regarding.  NOTE if you leave the app at all the diagnostics are disabled so you will need to reenable them in that case.,baconreader,cjofv2l,1,t5_2sbiz

3168470,0,t3_2we1ru,If you are being asked to wait that is coming directly from reddits rate limiting.  There is not anything we can do to bypass that.  Sorry.   As for crossposting is there a way to do it on the desktop reddit.com?  There is not a way to post to  subs at once via the app...and not sure the api would even allow it.,baconreader,coqesf5,1,t5_2sbiz
3168629,0,t1_coqesf5,Yeah Ive only used the app havent posted from the site. I didnt figure there was a way to post to two subs at once but I wasnt sure about the wait between posting. Like I said it can be a pain in the ass having to wait  minutes between posts when you want to post to multiple subs. Oh well if its just a reddit thing Ill just have to wait!

This might seem ignorant to you but I would accept a words adaptation if any of the credible dictionaries adapted to this change too.The main reason why Im saying this is that The American Heritage Dicionary changes words like aesthetic due to its method of using a usage panel which hasnt been accepted by other dictionaries. I believe it would make sense to adapt aesthetic but I cant stand behind this notion without it being widely accepted by other credible sources.I appreciate the concern.,baconreader,creeeg9,2,t5_2sbiz

Ive walked out of convenience stores with snacks while she finished pumping gas into the car and youd think I was a slaver from the glares.  Both of these were her call.  Like hey Ill pump you go get the stuff.   But people dont know that.  If I dont act quick all people see is that poor lady has to do that...So which is the lesser of two evils?
