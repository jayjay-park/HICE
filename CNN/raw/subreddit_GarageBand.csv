2896652,0,t3_2szj0i,Ive found that there are  good ways to collab with other artists using Garageband. . Export Individual Tracks you can send individual tracks ie. guitars vocals etc. to a bandmate to import into their Garageband project. . Share Entire Projects You can send youre entire project by compressing it into a zip file and sending it via email dropbox etc.Hope this helps! ,GarageBand,cnxcr11,1,t5_2twyd

8038516,0,t1_d4jkjc8,Yeah I played with Garageband for  months before I understood it well enough to write music I think Apples Ilife software had a sound effects suite that I imported into my sound library. Just download all the jam packs and if you arent comfortable in the library just reinstall the sound library and it will find them and put them all in the same place....It was really easy. But you lose points for not having your stuff backed up. I mean its sooooo easy to do. Its catastrophic losing all your data especially if you are working on  stuff. I would look into getting your Time Machine up with an external drive...and you will NEVER have to go through this again. ,GarageBand,d4jlrup,1,t5_2twyd
