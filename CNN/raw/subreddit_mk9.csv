1902150,0,t3_2ezviq,I would strongly suggest just getting a controller specifically for fighting games.  I know its a bit of extra money on top of the price of the system and game but it really is worth it if you play fighters even somewhat regularly.  Id suggest a MadCatz SFIV fightpad if you can find one... they also put out the exact same pad with WWE branding on it a while ago which may be easier to find.,mk9,ckiebyo,1,t5_2sd0x
