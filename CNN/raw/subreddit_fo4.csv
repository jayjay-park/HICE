4171995,0,t1_crvdmud,Unless youre an expert in the field of game design and can recognize engine just by looking at a short  second video of a teaser trailer then you cant tell anything. You can make an educated guess but nothing is  certain.Even if they did reuse the Skyrim engine that means nothing. Because the old engine was coded for the old generation of games. Xbone and PS are completely different systems thats why none of the old games will work on them. Its entirely possible they had to recode a bunch of the old system to work on the new generation of consoles.Plus with Windows  recently announced its usually assumed that most major game developers are given early access to new operating systems to ensure the games will run on them at least shortly after launch if not immediately on launch.We dont know anything about the engine and we dont know what they had to do to get things working on all the systems. Its possible they built a new engine its possible they had to update the old engine.My post was from the perspective of assuming she was right then... not some experts insight on to the development of Fallout . The whole counterpoint of my post was based off the theoretical assumption that the SandraReed account is actually legit. Its just as likely it was some troll post and not the actual employee and we wont ever know unless the account creator is verified or until Fallout  is actually released.,fo4,crvtcdr,2,t5_2tzv4

Since theres not much else to it anyone who decides to buy it would know what to expect.A game on the other hand is more complex. It is an experience not an object. Due to the personal nature of this its up to each consumer to determine if they honestly know enough about the game to preorder wait or never buy. Im making the argument that choosing to never buy is foolish because one cant have a personal experience or learn about the personal experience of others with a game that isnt even finished yet.Now I wont argue against preordering because regardless of the changes made the sheer fact this game is Fallout  can be a strong enough personal reason to put your money down.

Then each week a baseball game came on the TV. If their team won they got food and electricity. If they lost they lived the rest of the week in darkness.

4500125,0,t3_3cp0ti,Active repair as in FONV is not my cup of tea mostly because it was no real challenge to keep the weapons repaired to a state in which they did well enough. Repair skill was just a save moneyskill esp. in FO where travelling caravans could fix to .Still it is postapoc and even in modern times soldiers must keep their gear maintained. I hope that all weapons will have a chance to jam budging a quick reload or something similar and that perks can passively reduce or eliminate the risk. Risk of failure should be big enough to make mitigating perks worth the investment for battlebuilds but low enough to allow other builds to disregard it. Perhaps rapidfire weapons and HiTech stuff could have increased chance of misfire while simple smoothbore weapon shotguns and grenade launchers had a lower risk.Failure of technology is a big part of most postapoc settings IMO including FO. The world around the player will show this with its broken roads and trashheap homes but bringing the techfall directly to the character will make them feel it on a more personal level. A FO without the old durability system is a win in my book  but failing to insomewayoranother bringing the techfall in on a personal level would be a loss. I am not saying that weapon misfire is the only way to show this and I am excited to see in what otheradditional ways BGS will may implement it.,fo4,csxw81s,6,t5_2tzv4

4613036,0,t3_3e6m71,Well technically it cant work. If the lore is anything they didnt develop microchips like we did. They miniaturized nuclear technology but still use vacuum tube technology for their electronics. Similar to our computer tech in the s. A Pipboy as advanced as the ones in the game would require  microprocessors. Both in the Pipboy itself and one that was implanted in the brain. It would have to read the bioelectrical signals in the brain that had been previously mapped and convert that into digital data to be transmited to the Pipboy for information display. And I suppose one in every limb to display individual limb damage although I think you would know if your limb was crippled simply by looking at it if by chance you couldnt feel that intense pain.We currently have technology very close to this. Microchips in the brain with mapped information that can be used to electronically operate advanced prosthetics.But as far as FO Pipboys go I dont believe it is possible. Just one of those things that cant really be explained. You just have to accept that it works...somehow.Thats the best that I can do after a couple of beers in at am lol,fo4,ctc1y7u,4,t5_2tzv4

Im pretty sure there will be a whole bunch of perks that you wont get by leveling up but by completing certain quests or meeting certain criteria as it has always been. And there probably exist some ways to boost your stats.Implants seem to be a good possibility as it would fit with the theme and bobbleheads yeah.There will probably be other ways to gain perk points outside of leveling up as well. Because if you can only gain  perk per level and assuming you wont start with one you could only get  perks as it stands right now. With a confirmed estimate of  base perks and  if you add up all ranks... there just have to be a way to gain more.

Supply and demand no one  needs a pip boy edition  myself included.Rationalizing the unethical. That being said what youre describing isnt scalping. If you bought a copy and then saw that the prices were absurdly high you would be stupid to not sell your copy. It becomes unethical when you start depriving others of a product for the sake of selfserving interests. While selfserving to take advantage of the free market your original intent was not to do so. Arguably unethical but to not as great an extent as scalping. Think of it as being akin to the difference between first degree and second degree murder. gt It balances out to whats realistically important to the party who bought it fair and square.Again rationalization and shifting the blame. I even covered both of these. gt This argument is weak and lacks any semblance of logic. Its no different than shifting the blame to the economic markets failure to match supply with demand or blaming the people that buy from scalpers. Its just a way of rationalizing ones actions and shifting the blame to another. Also on the topic of resellers rights Id urge you to look over the law. I gave you a link to the state by state law regarding resale and scalping. America is not a capitalist country. Theres no such thing as a capitalist country and there never has been one to my knowledge. And even if we lived in one that wouldnt make unethical behavior become ethical. For example slavery doesnt become ethical when you live in a society that condones slavery. Textbook example man. Textbook example.

4779272,0,t3_3gcxss,Thats  less weeks for quality control and other last minute patching and testing that BGS may have factored into their dev cycle. Probably more important though is the financial factors ZeniMax has figured out for FO sales. They probably want it to be a must have holiday season game. An Oct. nd release might be just a bit too far ahead to have its release time hype wane by Christmas shopping season. So they probably want it to be super fresh in peoples minds and relatively new in order to get the most sales. Plus thats also less time for any critical backlash or hype dampening feedback to materialize.As well they could have other bundles in the mix that theyve contracted for. Xbox One is already getting FO for free with purchase. Wouldnt be crazy if MS introduces a FO XB One bundle for the holiday to help move some systems and so they would probably want the release date the same for both bundled and unbundled versions so they can steal some PS sales.

But there are still many things the chara would never say.The chara of a good friend of mine is highly religiously devoted typ who has many limitation for himself so its highly counter productive if your psychopathic flagellant suddenly says something that would be a  turn of doing things just because the option was to vague.This are ofcs PnP characters and for someone like you it wouldnt make much sense and it would be more like why would you limit yourself to such extend etc?

4835351,0,t1_cu3dkd9,gt Like the T it is designed for a single human operator patterned after the human silhouette. Unlike its older sibling it is an integrated selfcontained combat suit. The exterior shell is made from a polylaminate composite capable of absorbing over . kilojoules of energy without damage. The strength of the material is further enhanced by the organic rounded profile of the shell improving the chances of deflecting projectiles and explosions compared to the older steel plating present on the T. The shell is coated in a  micron silver ablative layer that allows for reflecting laser blasts and radiation emissions without damaging the composite surface directly. The surface can be treated in a special chemical process to increase its defensive properties substantially. To further enhance protection against direct contact with and contamination by radioactive biological or chemical substances the armor can be made air tight allowing its operator to explore even the most contaminated areas with reasonable safety as long as the armor is not compromised. The helmet is an integral part of this protection fitted with a rubberized cowl mounted to the chest plate and providing a tight seal. As with all Tseries the vision slit is bulletproof. Compared to its predecessor the helmet is smaller and more durable made out of a single piece of composite with an easily removable vision assembly. As with the T the ear ports double as accessory mounting points with a dropdown aiming ocular being standard on all T suits. A foreheadmounted lamp is provided for convenience.Your commenter only focused on the . kj part while ignoring things like the fact that it is built to deflect bullets furthermore the armor is treated with chemicals to make it even stronger.

A lower SPECIAL count just works better with the new perk system to force the player to think about how they want to distribute their first few level up points. Also since theyre allowing you to level up all your stats all the way to ten its best to keep your initial stats low to incentivize putting points into raising your SPECIAL.As to why pretty much all the dwellers in FOS have crappy stats its simple.

This concept of multiple perk points to make your special higher is ridiculous as gaining higher levels will become EXPONENTIALLY harder the higher your level. If there are  individual perks that you can put a perk point into why on earth would they make you level up more than once and save up perk points just to get ONE perk level higher or ONE special level higher.

5209351,0,t1_cvdvxm5,I didnt claim consoles have equal graphics  remember that the term graphics is as broad as you can get. I said that people shouldnt be surprised when PC textures dont look noticeably better than console textures. The PC version should look better in most other areas. If you havent seen the countless outrages about PC versions being severely held back due to consoles you havent been looking very hard. If youre narrowing what you meant down to graphically intense games and nonconsole ports then I somewhat agree. PC exclusives and graphically demanding games display a bigger gap between PC fidelity and console fidelity. I never claimed both platforms were equal in  of cases I never even claimed they were equal. Having said that yes parity contracts actually exist. There are agreements that say certain versions cannot be significantly superior to other versions. This is to balance the market and ensure that people believe theyre all fairly getting the same product. No its not good for the consumer. And no it doesnt happen all the time. This practice likely only occurs with massive publishers and developers like Ubisoft and EA.Antialiasing smoothens jagged edges and has nothing to do with texture quality.

On higher levels say it takes  XP to level up then that extra  gives you an extra  XP and starts becoming worth it. However why boost INT that high right from the start if thats the case. I would rather have a balanced character right from the start.I would think that the XPboost from intelligence applies to all XP gained.

Plus Pete or someone said in a tweet that we are limited to ONE companion no matter whether theyre a humanoid or a petrobot. I want to keep them somewhere though I was hoping that the number of companions would be tied to Charisma or Perks somehow so I could have a Mass Effect squad thing going on but I guess just like the last games that such a thing would be overpowered.,fo4,cw1zlju,2,t5_2tzv4

Seeing as he has a copy and the depth in which he spoke would imply hes been playing longer than a day or two. All of these seem as though hes just as clueless as the rest of us.gtBethesda have been showing us actual ingame footage since FO was announced. They are one of the few developerscompanies who I trust not to bait and switch with graphics andor features. Any footage we have seen so far is how the game will look provided youre playing on a next gen console or have a decentenough PCPossibly insignificant but I feel hed be slightly more confident if hed actually played the game.gtWhoa this is perhaps the second instance of the dialogue system weve seen and I just realized that Piper is ACTUALLY ANIMATED and moves somewhat like a human being when she speaks. This is a HUGE step up from the old way the camera used to zoom in on the person speaking with their hands at their sides. I can not wait for this goddamned game. I think this is the first time in my life I wish FallAutumn was a whole month shorter.Posted mealy  days before. Youd think he wouldve run into other NPCs at some point. Being this excited about Pipers animation is questionable still no concrete evidence. Though he says he ...cant wait for this goddamned game... Hmmmm. gtTechnically that was Obsidians doing but FO was pretty glitchy too. Granted that game came out  years ago and was made to run on very different systems PC  and PS...and as we have heard programming for the PS was rather difficult especially when it was somewhat of a new console. I know Bethesda games can be a bit janky but I have high hopes that with the years of experience updated engine and more powerful console architecture thats much closer to PC should make for a smoother game. I HOPE.Again a skeptical statement from someone who has allegedly played the game.gtFinally a post praising how secretive Bethesda has been with their marketing...The simple fact that he would risk his uncles job leads me to believe hes full of shit but if you needed more evidence here it is.,fo4,cw5p4y3,5,t5_2tzv4

5455156,0,t3_3psabr,Not only is that the most predictable story they could come up with I think the BladeRunner Theory falls apart because we can use chems and are likely to see gore of ourselves being ripped apart when we die.I suppose it all depends on the android technology and how much of it is organic. From what weve seen so far not much of it is! Granted it is a little fishy that our vault uses cryogenics and even more suspicious that we are the only survivor. And well... It is Bethesda. I could see the story taking a predictable path.   I think it would be more interesting if you find your wifehusband as an android... Your reaction to them would also play into the politics of the region destroy them for being a perversion of your loved ones memory side with them and rage against the Institute or hunt them down for the institute.

5487872,0,t1_cwd3hvd,As a software developer I respectfully disagree. GPUs are and always have been pushed very hard especially toward the end of product cycles with the exception being obviously poorly developed games. Its convoluted by the fact different hardware unsurprisingly reacts differently so using the GPU better on one platform can mean using the GPU worse on another.We can make GPUs more powerful more easily than we can with CPUs which means we can still push things a little further for a little longer. But it reaches a limit. And if you want your games to be more interactive more immersive more simulative and generally more technically advanced we need competition and advancements in processor technology period. The GPU is not a solution to all problems.Im personally upset by the current market and desperately hope some marketparadigm shift happens soon.,fo4,cwd4juz,1,t5_2tzv4

5493733,0,t3_3qc48c,I enjoyed Morrowinds story. ...Oblivion was meh.... And I actually found the story of Fallout  to be one of its major flaws especially compared to the old Black Isle games. New Vegas was markedly superior in that regard Although it was developed by Obsidian. Skyrim was much better than previous Bethesda titles and showed that Bethesda had learned from a lot of Fallout s short comings. The story telling was much better but I still found some of the sidequests much more interesting than the main story which was kind of flat. As for Fallout . Well. Bethesda really shines at telling a story with clutter and props  dungeons and locations always have a story to tell if youre looking. Furthermore they are coming at this trying a whole new angle with a voiced player character and seem to be working hard to make sure youre connected to your character. The success of Skyrim  and well the back to back success of most of their tittles  ensure that this games budget is massive. I think I read somewhere that the voice actors worked on the project for a really long time something like two years when most voiced projects for games only last a handful of months. Over all it shows promise despite the inconstancy of quality in Bethesdas storytelling!,fo4,cwdvjnm,6,t5_2tzv4

If you focus SPECIAL before perks you can get to  across the board early then Bobblehead farm for  while you start picking perks only.For starters not a single person is going to pick or want ALL Perks. I almost never use Melee weapons on my main builds because I prefer range in this type of Setting. That removes dozens of perk choices right there that I would have no interest in and would not help my character. Then there are likely superfluous perks like VANS that dont make you more powerful that can be skipped.I can still create a  SPECIAL God Character way earlier than  by just not being dumb and avoiding perks that wont help me or I have no interest in. Lets face it having all the perks may seem cool but there is a good chunk that people wont even use in most God Builds because they dont fit their playstyle.Now lets say you really do want to get every single perk on your character... As long as enemies keep respawning after x amount of time there will be plenty of people who will sit there and kill the same  dozen Super Mutants over and over again until they hit .Now lets include mods they are on all platforms so they are a guaranteed source of XP which you have overlooked. Modded quests will have new NPCs and new Quests that will increase the amount of XP we can get even further. Im not saying it is easy but plenty of people will be able to MAX OUT their characters because people will pour over every inch of this game map and will spend hundreds of hours on their mains. Saying that people will not max out is ridiculous because lets face it if you arent going to spend the hours of work to max out then that just means YOU are not one of the people who normally maxes out but others will be willing to put in the time.,fo4,cwh5ip6,2,t5_2tzv4

For the most part to me VO is an overly expensive cost to the game development that adds very little value.

5539512,0,t1_cwjiy0n,While you bring up a good point I dont think sacrificing CHA or END for INT will make you level any more slowly. It will undoubtedly make quests harder because you cant charm your way through them. But youd arguably earn more XP because you have to kill raiders to get the job done. However one thing no one is taking into account is whether or not Nerd Rage perk is really good. If rank  perk is a copy of the FONV version that could be very good for a melee build. And if rank  is better than that itll make a melee character nearly unstoppable. Right now Im counting on my melee character starting with  INT but that may change depending on the differences in xp value and how good Nerd Rage is.,fo4,cwjpz0s,2,t5_2tzv4

5550355,0,t3_3r5gpo,Repairing was always stupid unless you modded your game to take  rounds before your gun essentially broke.  If you purchase a gun and it breaks or even jams after just firing  rounds then you best return it and not buy HiPower again.  Maintenance should be done using maintenancecleaning kits not using other guns because how the hell is replacing different parts of a gun going to fix a buildup of dirt in your upper receiver unless youre stupid enough to replace your entire upper receiver instead of just doing routine maintenance.  The only way I could see it being done is with maintenance kits and low quality guns like the pipe gun degrading quickly while any prewar gun that isnt rusted is fine with the occasional cleaning every couple hundred rounds.  ,fo4,cwl2mxt,1,t5_2tzv4

Shoot a Grenade out of a Super Mutants Hands to blow them up.Why would someone use VATS? Why would a person go for anything other than a Headshot every time?  Cripple foes and Disarms.Do you get more experience? None that Im awareDo you deal more damage? If you get perks for it. YesAre there SkillsPerks? In Previous titles. Yes. More Agility meant more Action Points. More Actions Points meant you could shoot more in VATS. You combo that with Better Accuracy Perks as well a few other Perks I shall not name. Would be an amazing combo.  As for Fallout  I am not aware. I tend to avoid spoilers.Is there a Downside to playing the game without using VATS? The only Downsides are not having the Upsides to using VATS. Outside of those. No. ,fo4,cwlw2fu,3,t5_2tzv4

Also that will include Rifleman and Awareness both good traits for someone planning on using rifles or being a marksman.E.  mainly for Toughness and Life Giver both will make you harder to kill good for a newbie Wastelander.C.  for Local Leader since you wont be a theif trading between settlements might be a better way to make money if that is how that works. Either way at least a mid level CHA will help you early on for conversations you cant shoot your way through. Plus youll get access to Attack Dog which will aid your shooting in VATS if youre using Dogmeat or conversely you could take lone wanderer which buffs damage and carry capacity if you have no companions.I.  for Science! Hacker Gun Nut and Scrapper. This allows you to craft any ranged weapon youll be able to craft and Hacker for similar reason to lockpick to bypass andor access potentially harmfuladvantageous areas. Plus with higher INT you will level up faster and be able to pick more perks more rapidly.A.  for commando and Sneak pretty self explanitory. Its nice not to be noticed all the time and commando will aid your  handed automatics. Gunslinger will also be available if you decide to use pistols.L.  could have been  but Id try to get it up to  for Better Criticals so I gave it the leftover point I still had to make that take less time. This will also give you access to Bloody Mess which is a general Damage increase. Plus Fortune Finder and Scrounger can provide help early on with caps and ammo.Thats not my build Im a sniperdemo expert with lots of sneak .

Your bobby pins never break.Meaning that there are probably only four lock difficulties because there is little reason to have two levels that you can access from start.

Lock picking was extremely important in FO.This build is for my favorite perks as well as faster leveling for more perks.  I consider locksmith a must have perks based on playing through Fallout  many times. S so I can add mods to armor P Rifleman rifle damage Awareness enemy weaknesses locksmith absolute must at least when you start running into advanced locks and higher E for toughness maybe increase later for aqua boy if there are a lot of under water sections C For attack dog and so I dont miss too much content by having a low charisma.

5579890,0,t3_3rjz61,I think theyre both excellent games that really show off the strengths and weaknesses of each developer. To steal a line from Adam Sesslers New Vegas review for Xplay theyre companions pieces. The atmosphere and physical environment were the strengths of Fallout  leading to a darkly humorous setting that was great to explore and that felt alien and different while simultaneously being familiar and recognizable Both to players of older Fallout games but also New players that could feel some relation to the real world settingThe writing characters and worldbuilding were the big strengths of New Vegas. Obsidian created an intricate world that you could really sink your teeth into even if the physical exploration of it was not as fleshed out as Fallout  with complex political and social structures that allowed debates like Who is the best faction to support to really matter. Characters like Mr House Caeser Ulysses and Joshua Graham Which by the way I love the fact that theres companion mods for both of them really sold the personal side of that world and its politics to a much greater level than anything in Fallout .I love them both equally for different reasons. Im fully expecting Fallout  to be more similar to  but from the few things Ive seen it looks like theyve improved the strength of their writing and storytelling.,fo4,cwoqjuh,5,t5_2tzv4

Notably the variation in weaponry ammunition and mods. It felt less black and white had a branching narratives more impactful choices etc. Yet I found a lot of quests for example the whole BoS questline basically a massive fetch quest to be rather bland.,fo4,cwor6y2,5,t5_2tzv4

These points seem to not coincide with previous formulas for weve seen a many of time scenario with well over  points up to  on a ghoul of such resistence . I think a forward way of thinking about the formula would be such as skyrims armor cap of  equally a  damage threshold  so each  point in any resistence should equal a percentage of damage ignored on original effect. ,fo4,cwqs1je,2,t5_2tzv4

5599071,0,t1_cwr3qx6,Thats right but going  END early on means you wont have that many points to invest elsewhere. Thats why Im going  INT as well to get levels as soon as possible to invest into things I want.However Charisma also is an important skill. Thats why for the first  levels Im maxing it out. For one specific reason  the amount of EXP you will be able to get.Heres what Im talking about SPOILERS FOR ONE OF THE COMPANIONS PERKS BUT THATS IT NOTHING MORE So every time you are successful with a speech prompt you get EXP. Now I dont know how much EXP were talking about but as an example lets use . With  EXP as our base we can add another  for the  INT that ends up being  EXP. One of the companions perks is that they double the EXP you gain from speech checks so its another  EXP which get us to  EXP. Well Rested should also add a  EXP if its actually  EXP and not more per speech check. Of course Im not sure if its how the EXP will be calculated maybe its going to be more if its done in a different way but right now this is the lowest possible outcome. But either way thats . times more EXP per single speech check. spoiler,fo4,cwr49f0,1,t5_2tzv4

5603899,0,t3_3rvi6i,Its annoying how the two major complaints about this game are  the dialogue is too simplified and boring and offered no real interaction and choice. And  the map is too damn small. For fucks sake its annoying as hell when people decide to say how this game is completely ruined now just because the map isnt as big as just cause  or that the dialogue isnt as intricate and defining as fallout  and new Vegas even though it had more dialogue choices but really wouldnt unlock new choices. The map size is defined quality over quantity and its not ment to have vast open space with literally nothing else to do ex MGS just cause GTA. And of  course the map isnt gonna be to the exact size of the Boston area cause that would be to much to make and would make it too much random asking time from one place to another. ,fo4,cwrpue6,-4,t5_2tzv4

These are like special stats such as move  faster on a leg bracer or You deal more damage to robots on a shotgun and other stuff. The stats also seem better but I havent been able to do a perfect side by side comparison to confirm that yet. They also seem to have SPECIAL boosts built in quite commonly.All in all theyre just hands down better than the basic counterparts in every which way.

5619589,0,t3_3s33pp,I have been a PC gamer my whole life and have never played shooters with a controller.  Played fo on PS because it was out first and also PC later. Never thought Id use a controller on PC but recently used it for gta v and witcher  as controller was just easier especially driving in gta v.  Ive really learned to like the Xbox controller for non shooters.Fallout  gives me some problems because all the running around lends itself to controller but the improved shooter mechanics require a mouse for me at least.If like gta v fo allows it I may actually use both.  Controller most of the time and then switch to keyboard and mouse if there are more enemies than I can kill in vats or inventory management.,fo4,cwtnx28,0,t5_2tzv4

5640441,0,t1_cwvjq1e,Yeah the keyboard controls work really well for the game until you are in a menu. Sometimes tab exits sometimes esc exits. Sometimes enter confirms an action sometimes R confirms an action.Not being able to use the scroll wheel in the pip boy and the letter fade on some sub menus far to the left or right can make it hard to find things read items and can be overall frustrating.The issue with E not being something you can map has some issues as well.All in all I think some of the menu operations are extra bad on PC but the game has basically bad menu design as a whole.,fo4,cww91j8,5,t5_2tzv4

5641287,0,t1_cwwcppu,Continue with the minutemen quest chain its a pretty okish tutorial. Regarding ammo conservation is a good idea at the start as ammo is tight and you dont have enough caps to keep buying it. Try to use a diverse variety of weapons as this will mean any ammo you pick up can be used. pipe weapons are the best at the start as all raiders carry the ammo. The guns are shit you gotta use what you got. Also if you are new to Fallout stick to medium difficult cause the higher difficulties make the mobs a bit bullet spongey. Try to not fast travel too much because you miss out on the scavenging and also scavenging as much as you can without getting over burdened.Hope that helps.,fo4,cwwctm4,1,t5_2tzv4

5643732,0,t1_cwwmv1h,True but its the first thing a lot of players experienced in the first  minutes of playing granted that happens in a lot of games. I get that a game might not have the best visuals or graphics. I get that game with great visual or graphics will probably have a lot of bugs. But both? Its a little inexcusable.

5644803,0,t1_cwwnykk,I kind of felt the same.  Frankly in my experience one of the weakest elements of most Bethesda games is that I feel very little attachment to my character.  The same is generally true of the other characters in the game though there are some companionsstory characters who are exceptions.That being said Ive also never really played a Bethesda game that I felt was a significantly worse experience for the lack of characterization.  Obviously part of the whole make your own story paradigm kind of requires the main character to be something of a blank slate but more to the point I dont really go to Bethesda games for a gutwrenching story.  For me these games truly shine in their excellent world building and atmosphere.  That being said I do think the opening for Fallout  was quite good.  It had next to no emotional impact for me because like you said I hadnt really been exposed to anything at that point that allowed me to connect with the spouse and child.  However in terms of the overall aesthetic I thought it was great.,fo4,cwwsj5w,1,t5_2tzv4

This can be done by providing them with  fusion cores. The store in this vault carries a . caliber combat rifle which can be purchased for a little over  caps if no barter perks have been taken.

Now sell back one of the rounds.. Sell back the remaining rounds you just bought. One round glitches and stays with you for some reason. Keep selling this until youve rinsed the vendor of bottle caps.. OPTIONAL Buy back all of the vendors rounds. Then buy whatever you want and accept the trade.Remember vendors in Fallout  replenish their bottle caps every  hours. So once youve bled a vendor dry sleep for a day rinse and repeat.

5653456,0,t3_3sjxlo, Most areas topoff at   storys tall.  Theres a cap on how many individual structures each wall each floor each turret etc you can build in each area.  Its a fairly high limit you wont really reach unless youre building a sprawling mansion. Stairs can be a little awkward to place but you also have Ladders and shorter Steps which work fine even when not snapping to the grid. Youre limited to your building materials you need to scavenge the raw materials and your perks.  Some structures require science Leader or other perks in order to construct. Each area has a finite area which you can build.  Within that area you can pretty much do what you want.   Power can be a little quirky.  You dont have to run cables through your buildings though... I usually put a big generator on the room and power pillons on the four corners.  Thats usually enough to cover lights for a threestory building and keeps the generator out of reach from raiders. Attracting settlers can be frustrating.  Even with all the amenities you probably will still see only  settlers or so.  You can let them do their own thing or you can manually assign them tasks like farming running a weapon store savaging for materials etc. While I dont normally advocate cheats... I found it extremely useful to Save my game turn on god mode for the infinite building supplies and just mess around with construction until I learned how it all worked.  Then reverted the save game.,fo4,cwxv7e6,1,t5_2tzv4

5653908,0,t3_3s0x3g,I started on survival first Fallout game ever and it wasnt too hard to begin with. The first Deathclaw was a problem and took around  attempts but easy once you know how  just takes longer. There was a problem which I personally think is a problem with the game. I was clearing a compound of enemy raiders and accidentally went through a new instance door. The game autosaved covering my old save when I went through and fractions of a second later around  enemy raiders appeared in front of me. I was on a very very small balcony.Instantly died due to  raiders in touching distance of me. Game loaded back to the autosave and again instantly died. It took about  attempts to not instantly die so I could lower the difficulty to very easy to shoot my way out.Thank god you can lower the difficulty otherwise I wouldve had to start a new game.Survival seems fair  but is  difficult and most of what you do will take a few attempts or a creative approach but you do get more out of the game because you cant play it mindlessly.Very easy seems stupidly easy but again thank god its there for when I needed it.,fo4,cwxx7zg,1,t5_2tzv4

In New Vegas even though you were written to be the courier you could just tell people  you werent and that you were just a wanderer or whatever. I just really hope that Obsidian gets to make a New Vegas equivalent to this game where they actually have freedom of choice. Id compare this game more to Deus Ex mixed with Stalker then I would Fallout New Vegas.I think Fallout  is substantially more similar to Skyrim than the previous Fallout games. Immediately taking charge of a random faction being stuck in a specific role everyone cares about you being dragonborn. Generally just a downgrade for enthusiasts of roleplaying but a lot of it is made up for by the new game mechanics.

5668616,0,t3_3sr9j1,Practically although ammo consumption seem to be higher for a specific type than scavenging them back thus you have to rotate weapons at points.And theres some unique items waiting to be found.This version of the game probably has the best respawn mechanics up to this point.

Sarah Connor Helen Parr and Beatrix Kiddo all became stay at home moms. Her husbands an veteran maybe they went to the range together. Maybe shes a competition shooter. And while she is confirmed to have a law degree very little else is confirmed about her backstory. Doesnt rule out her being a mercenary for a columbian drug lord back in her early twenties if thats what you want to imagine. A lot of the other stuff if variable as well  You didnt have to straight out attack the raider. You could have let them attack first and then your actions are fully justified. She doesnt have to be a wilting flower and freak out over having to defend herself. As for the distractions you can basically walk away from everything. You could focus on the MQ if you wanted to. Even if we disregard the fact youre basically in a world thats completely alien to you now and you might not know how to proceed you could walk away from literally every quest that doesnt contribute to finding Shaun. But obviously your character isnt going to go around asking everyone if theyve seen their kid because thats not going to work. That doesnt happen in real life  they go to the Detective agencies and the News and say This is my kid help me find them.You cant even pretend that you have to be distracted by the sidequests if you want to do them because you can finish the main quest and then complete all those side quests if you want to run the role play. ,fo4,cx1qm8y,1,t5_2tzv4

5686124,0,t3_3smno7,I sided with the institute in a hope of working things out between them and the commonwealth. I guess it sort of worked? Im the Director now so I call the shots but having to kill so many people along the way makes me feel like I got tricked. I lived long enough to see myself become the villain. The game tricked me into ignoring the kidnappings and the murders to focus on what the future could be. Kinda blows my mind. When I went to the Railroad with the objective of destorying them they welcomed me congratulated me on recent work and went over the next mission. It made me sick to go into VATS and blow them all up. Kudos to the game for that. That was real emotion I felt there and when I had to kill Paladin Danse in the last mission.I just wanted more options after the fact... The details definitely fell short at the end.

As such a large emphasis must be put on perks and their benefits to your playtrough.These include but are not limited to weapon damage survivability and scavening boosting things. So for example you might need to invest on the perk under luck that lets you get more ammo. As well as more damage with your chosen armament... or stealth criticals if you want to do stealth stuff... you get the point right?It also seems that if you travel to specific places youre tossed into missions harder than your gear would realisticly let you do so consider doing other sidequests to get yourself going.,fo4,cx1zqmu,1,t5_2tzv4

5689932,0,t3_3smwi9,Im late to the thread but I wonder if you had already cleared Monsignor Plaza by your own.  I had the quest sitting in my log too but I only noticed it going bad after clearing Cambridge.  Finding a website that has all IDs is troublesome. Very annoying Bethesda is so late with modding support to get wikis filled by crawlers.  EDIT  Kidnapping at County Crossing  MinRecruit  AD  Note that the hex number isnt unique. A quest called Min has the same hex but its a different quest.  I was on the part where it said talk to preston because you failed it aka too slow or maybe bugged because of cleaning the monsignor plaza while the quest was active.  Stages before sqs MinRecruit   done                    not set  done  not set      done    not set  Then I put in resetquest MinRecruit. The quest was removed from my quest list. Stages after sqs MinRecruit                             not set    done  The quest isnt in my completed quests. Normally your minute men recruitment quests that are completed show up in the bottom list so its definitively reset.  Ill assume the  stage is a way of letting the engine know that I had already cleared monsignor plaza and that it shouldnt offer me that quest. From other posts I found people get kidnapping at xxx quests which is the same quest for different settlements but they all send you to the same monsignor plaza.

Or is there a disadvantage like resources not being refreshed as often given the time it takes to traverse between settlements separated by great distance? Or is just easier to maintainmodify with your chairbybridge method love that btw if you have shorter distances and therefore a better chance at catching your provisioner and redirectingreassigning as needed.So just to be clear... we are  positively absolutely certain that supplychained settlements as well as all indirectlyconnected settlements share all resources not just junk? With the catch being that the workbenches at the individual settlements all still hold the items unique to that respective settlement so if I were to open the workbench at Red Rocket I would not also see the items stored in my Sanctuary workbench?

Not sure if thats what you have but from what Ive seen the . hunting rifle does more damage than a heavily modded combat or assault rifle just fires much more slowly of course.  Which is disappointing someone correct me if Im wrong but it seems like apart from legendary weapons I wont be finding a tier of rifles that does more than a maxmodded hunting rifle which can be achieved at level .

5712219,0,t3_3tcs0n,In my opinion I would just go with the perk tree first. Then level the SPECIAL stats later. Ive been having a pretty great time putting all my points to the Perks that actually do something instead of just brute forcing the stats. To answer your question does more Agility make you sneakier? Yes. But that doesnt mean youll sneak more effectively. They built this new system around Perks so people dont have to feel bad about their starting stats being low. I have  strength but I dont plan on increasing it anytime soon. I travel alone with the Lone Wanderer Perk rank  and can carry  extra pounds. Could I carry more with more strength? Yes.

5717316,0,t3_3tdhnn,Thanks for posting.I love playing stealth in Bethesda games but I also love the added bonuses and interactions you get with a companion. Im only up to level  so I probably have yet to unlock many more companions but is there currently any way to improve stealth behavior on your companion? Despite Piper crouching when I crouch Im guessing she just makes so much more noise when walking that it reveals my position to enemies. I put light armor on her but besides that and giving her a silenced weapon am I SOL? I can always make her wait in certain spots while I explore but obviously no one wants that level of micromanagement in a companion if avoidable.Im pretty sure the answer to all this is Nope sorry. Companions suck for stealth. But figured Id ask here anyway.,fo4,cx5sf1o,1,t5_2tzv4

I dont think your actual level matters.The trick is as you get higher level some weapons will drop that have a higher base stat which means if you mod it in exactly the same way it will have a higher stat total.For example I had a combat rifle I got around level  that had a max damage in the s range fully moded.  One I just got at  has a max moded damage of  doesnt have legendary damage boost just higher base stats.,fo4,cx5xk21,2,t5_2tzv4

5719601,0,t3_3tfhhe,Im kinda the opposite. I have a natural tendency to work through the these kinds of games very slowly but a lot of the time get so caught up in actively avoiding the main quest line that I get burnt out on a gamelose interest and never end up seeing it through. For example Skyrim. I wanted to see everything in that game so I purposely didnt touch the main quest and just slowly explored and worked my way through the faction quest lines and other side stuff. To this day I still havent beaten that game. So this time around I decided I would push on with the main quest for the most part occasionally breaking it up with side quests. I intend to play through this game multiple times so I figure theres no harm in this. That way after I finish off the story I dont have to worry about avoiding spoilers as much and on subsequent play throughs can mess around with a bunch of mods etc.Having said all that Im around  hours in my save says  hours but Im not sure thats accurate and if I had to guess I would say Im halfway through the story? Its hard to say. So yeah haha Im still constantly getting sidetracked wandering around discovering. Not that its a bad thing  Im loving every minute of it.,fo4,cx62mkv,3,t5_2tzv4

5735765,0,t3_3toymd,This certainly feeds into my love of incremental games but it feels unnecessary to me. Locations repopulate loot respawns safes and terminals reset  and theres no level cap. I realise radiant quests arent that fun but they do give experience. The only thing you get from restarting is the opportunity to redo main quests  rediscover locations and see the other endings so why bother doing them at a crazy high level and ruin the excitement of finding and creating better weapons? Not to mention youll run out of the ammo you need for all those late game guns pretty sharpish.If I had to guess I would say Bethesda are encouraging us to stick with the same playthrough and wait for the DLC which will obviously add new quests but Im betting also more settlement options and perhaps even more perks. All of which are more accessible if youve completed the core game first. Even the FO and NV addons advised you to be at high levels to try them. Not to feed into the its not a real RPG crowd but I just dont see this as a repeated play through kind of game.,fo4,cx82tgz,3,t5_2tzv4

There would also have to be a distance limit between players so that it isnt trying to load enough to crash both games. Settlements would be a nightmare. How does it know whos placing what where? Who gets priority? Also you have to think i have most of the map and quests cleared. If my friend made a character that was brand new they couldnt do all that stuff because I cleared it all already. How would leveling work? There are a ton of reasons why bathesda doesnt introduce multiplayer and its for a good reason.

5742517,0,t3_3trokd,I have this weapon plus a SMG that has the same effect.The SMG is actually the better of the two because it doesnt have the spin up doesnt eat through as much ammo and is lighter. It kills stuff almost as quickly and is a great way to clear out Mirelurk egg clusters and take down flying insects and swarming enemies like Radroaches and Mirelurk Hatchlings. The AoE explosive damage knocks them right out of the air and can bring them down in groups if theyre close enough.Also this thing does splash damage that can hurt you at close range so you should be careful with it. Even wearing Power Armor it can whittle your health down without you noticing if youre not paying attention.

5750845,0,t1_cx9xvcf,Check your quests in the menu and follow the main ones. Pay attention to the top left corner of your screen as new mechanics come up it will explain how they work there.Dont worry about weapon modding or settlement building until you get to a certain point.The leveling system in this game works like thisYou have SPECIAL governing stats that are basically how good your character is at certain things.Strength lets you carry more and do more melee damage.Perception effects how good your aim is in VATS the slow down time thingEndurance effects how much damage you can take and how much you can sprint.Charisma helps you pass speech checks when talking with people. When talking with people some of the options will be yellow orange or red instead of green to tell you that its a speech check and how difficult it is.Intelligence governs how fast you level up.Agility gives you more action points which is used in VATSLuck fills your critical bar in VATS faster. When your bar is filled you can press the execute critical button before you shoot to fire a devastating shot that will always hit.If you look at the bottom of the screen when you have your menu up you will see a button you can press to go to the perk chart. This is how you will build your character. When you level up go here and choose either one of your SPECIAL stats to increase by one or once of the colored in cartoon perks to give yourself. Perks are kind of like skills in Skyrim. For example the lockpicking perk allows you to pick harder locks each time you choose it just like increasing lockpick skill in Skyrim does.If you have Strength  for example you can choose the top  rows of Strength perks. You can unlock ones further down by giving yourself more strength. Heres your to do listAfter leaving Vault  go back to your house and talk to Codsworth. After some fighting he will tell you to go to a town. Go to the town and help the people out there.When you finish helping them they will come back with you to Sanctuary the place Codsworth is.You should have a hang of things by then.,fo4,cx9y4o5,2,t5_2tzv4

Having your partner undertake the risk of carrying someone elses child to term aswell as engaging in the mammoth effort of raising is is absolutely terrible for any guy.Meanwhile any woman who wants to see her child fed and survive needs and should demand to monopolize the guys resources energy and protection. The larger family unit in so far as sustainable usually is made up by relatives such as parents siblings cousins etc. People whom supporting makes sense of an evolutionary point as they share a lot of genetic material. Its one of the reasons why for example homosexual relatives a sister a brother etc often times make for the best adoptive parents in case of the parents death. Theyre closely related to the child and have a true family connection while they very likely wont have any children of their own to threaten the childs position.Polyarmory and such is something of our resource oversaturated society. Its a luxus some people can engage in.The only times you find such things in the times of old are situations such as resource scarce places where several brothers are needed to keep a single wife and the children to whom they are all related to fed OR guys in position of power and such having access to an abundance of resources they can use to underhold several partners and the children they bear. ,fo4,cxa8ex7,3,t5_2tzv4

Lowering the shadow distance brings the draw calls down enough to get at least near  in the worst of areas. So you have three options turn shadow distance down to almost minimum or so use the dynamic shadow distance modwhat Im doing atm or deal with it and hope Bugthesda fixes it. If you decide to use the shadow mod set the desired FPS to  below your fps cap mines  so I set it to  with min shadow distance at  and max at . ,fo4,cxae9hf,1,t5_2tzv4

5761130,0,t1_cxb5jrm,I think some art assets were done in house and some got outsourced or bought from a model vender. In  shooters the way they make this work and remain performant is they double up on collision boxes. One collision piece is for player and A.I. movement and pathfinding. A second set of collision objects are reserved purely for projectiles and hitscan objects. This means putting an extra layer into the physics system and expands the pipeline time on the world objects. Bethseda probably got their major pieces done in house and minor pieces didnt get this attention. When we get the creation kit Ill actually be able to poke around and see if they even bothered with double collision sets. ,fo4,cxb7zsf,4,t5_2tzv4

If you get both perks maxed Sandman wouldnt matter unless you were using a silenced weapon and sneaking. Ninja multiplies the sneak damage regardless so Id assume that qualifies first and the Sandman resolves after the Ninja perk. So Ninja gives you a x sneak then sandman gives you  more of that so say it were an even  damage base youd be doing  damage with sneak and  with sneak and silencer. ,fo4,cxdl1yn,1,t5_2tzv4

The gen s and s are more like robots such as Mr Handys who follow only their programming and purpose and never deviate from their commands or wish and try to escape their masters. Nick seems to be a gen  in programming and technology since he has the free will and is his own personhe may be a continuation of the pre war detective but his actions and decisions are his own but on the exterior he more resembles a gen  or  since hes lacking the physical features that make gen s nearly indistinguishable from humans. He mentions that he thinks hes a prototype which would make sense if you think that the institute focused first on the programming and personalities of the gen s when creating them and after they finished that they prioritized the physical features to make them look human as well. Nick is possibly the first successful gen  in terms of the personality and programming but never got the visual enhancements to make him a true gen . He may have gone rogue or something before they could actually make him look human and then they stopped him erased his memory or something and threw him outhe mentions his earliest memory apart from the memories of pre war detective Nick was waking up in a garbage dump with only pre war Nicks memories so its likely that the memory of his time in the institute being created and tested was wiped.I hope at least some of that made sense I rambled quite a bit and didnt intend for the message to be that long.,fo4,cxe8ccs,2,t5_2tzv4

As long as your defense is higher than foodwater theres a really low chance of this happening.

When I did the Institute storyline there was a quest where theres a confrontation between the Institute trying to recruit someone and the Minutemen who got a distress signal from the guy that was being recruited because the guy was scared that the Institute was there to abduct him which wasnt really the case they wanted to recruit him to help them build something.If you have good enough persuasion you convince the Minutemen to stand down and let you take care of it and the Minutemen do not become your enemy.

They are synths made to kill and kill well and if they get a misguided command or their hunt leads them to kill innocent people they will succeed. No I am the only one who can hold a courser accountable. They arent just synths they are synths who had every part of them removed but hunting and killing.

5817082,0,t3_3uuvds,Note on arming settlers in your towns they only need one ammo. Literally one bullet shell missile whatever. As long as they have one ammo for the gun you manually equip on them they can load and fire it indefinitely.Because of this and when I can spare it I like to give all my settlers full auto weapons with drumlarge magazines. Unlike me they can afford to spray those bullets! And the larger mags do make a difference allowing them to spray longer between pausing to reload.I also use this to track new settlers. If I trade with someone who has more than one ammo I know theyre new or at least that I havent processed them yet. Once I pick out their gear and determine their job I make sure to take allexceptone appropriate ammo from them. This works better than the clothing method for me because sometimes newcomers randomly wear clothing too similar to the configurations I use for existing workers.Finally a tip on supply lines Your provisioners actually walk their routes and fight foes. Arm provisioners well and pick routes that line up as best you can with your own travel paths especially through hostile hot spots. That way if you run into each other and there are enemies about theyll join in the fight! They cant die from enemy damage but theyre not too useful if you left them with a pipe pistol and generic clothing. However theyre pretty awesome if you give them all fullauto laser rifles or highpowered hunting rifles etc. This is actually a compelling reason to create extra unnecessary supply lines between towns. I gear up all my provisioners to be wellarmed highway guards.,fo4,cxi5w7t,37,t5_2tzv4

For example if all  settlers are in the same building it leaves a whole lot of empty space in other areas of the settlement. It would be pretty hard to keep all corners of Sanctuary occupied if that makes sense. At the drivein I have POIs spread around so settlers are constantly walking backnforth between the farmshopshousingcrafting stations etc. I am just guessing but this probably helps prevent viable enemy spawns from popping up inside the settlement.,fo4,cxjf66d,1,t5_2tzv4

5827065,0,t1_cxjb4rf,Lol you try starting a cranky car with a low energy battery and tell me how well that goes. You need both. You need high current to get things moving but without high capacity you better hope it starts within a handful of rotations cause thats all youll get before it grinds to a halt. Youd also have frequent brownouts when you say flicked your high beams on because the battery has so little energy that it cant supply that sudden demand without a deep recharge afterward. Thats a crucial function of the battery since the alternator cannot respond to sudden demands very quickly.An MFC would work quite well as a car battery.

Also PipBoy is your friend use it to eat stuff to restore your health when fighting. If you think your armor is to soft then mod it change it buy more if you find a store. If your weapons are low then do the same. Wear the power armor if its to difficult. Also if you havent already figured this out  whenever you do something like kill someone turn a corner loot a case find a gun discover somewhere quicksave. If you do die which you will you wont find yourself going right back. Also  there is no correct route.

However the beginning of the game becomes MUCH tougher than normal but you will feel your character becoming more efficient as you gain levels and attain better equipment. The best part is youll have  times as many legendary items than normal and you wont know what to do with half of em since you have so many. By level  your character is a full on Wasteland Superhero pAs far as the bulletsponge concept i cant say youre wrong however i enjoy the challenge more than keeping the realism of the game.

Have a trunk for storing and transporting stuff big knobby tires maybe the upgrades could get you inflatable pontoons so it can cross water faster engine that kind of stuff.It could be a whole quest line to get everything together.  They already have locations in the game that would completely make sense for getting these things.  Build it at the Red Rocket get an engine from Corvega other steel parts from Saugus.The engine could even be a kind of funny troll moment because a cars engine weighs several hundred pounds so you end up encumbered and have to walk back. In terms of game mechanics they could it make act like a specialized power armor which would take care of the crafting gadget too.Now that I think about it there is a terminal entry at Red Rocket about a guy fixing up a motorcycle.

5869066,0,t1_cxoyld8,gt though I guess the limited one is because of balance and some of the dialogues actually have extra interactions from followers and everyone would just run around with two until they get all the perks.Maybe. Those probably could have been solved though. gtAll allies near you got  damage health and effects like that. For Fo it could have been like Leaders Presence increased accuracy health and maybe even critical chance for followersallies within range. Personally I would have instantly fallen for charisma character if such would be the case. Interactions where you have allies around you are quite limited but there are those encounters where allied faction is scavenging area X and enemies start stumbling around. It would have also increased efficiency with settlers since they dont level at all For some damn reason it would at least make them SLIGHTLY more efficient with the numerous weapons you give them. Damn the more I think of the Inspiring presence the more I want it.Well they sorta did that. I mean thats the point of the Inspirational perk.

With the Brotherhood they have their ideology and it isnt going to change for you the Minutemen are just the population of the Commonwealth they have no highend technological advances to further the reconstruction of the Commonwealth. Youd never move out of the shacks that you already live in. The Institute has the technological capability to rebuild Boston into something that PreWar architects would be jealous of. With the added and practically infinite synth manpower anything can be accomplished by the Institute especially if they manage to quell everyones fear and begin to lend a helping hand they stand to be the change for the better in this world.The Railroad only care about synths robots who with a slight change in the way they are built would not have personalities anymore and could no longer be considered sentient. The Brotherhood are fanatical in their genocidal ideology and it wont help anyone in the end.The Minutemen are a bunch of farmers with laser muskets good enough to start something but not smart enough to make it be any better than a conglomeration of shackdwellers fighting off supermutant attacks every other week. spoiler,fo4,cxq2n56,1,t5_2tzv4

5887765,0,t1_cxqze4o,gt Something to snipe with something for room to room close fighting shotgun or something automatic and something midrange some sort of semiauto nonscoped weapon. In practice my last two playthroughs have used the following.VATS PlaythroughgtSomething to snipe with  Combat RiflegtSomething for room to room close fighting   Combat RiflegtSomething midrange  Combat RifleSciency Power Armor focused playthoughgtSomething to snipe with  Plasma RiflegtSomething for room to room close fighting   Plasma RiflegtSomething midrange  Plasma RifleSo I kind of understand the gripe but really by the time Ive got my one weapon that I depend on Ive already been through  levels of lugging around a few weapons for different purposes.  So the other weapons are certainly still useful and with a few exceptions like the doublebarrel shotgun get plenty of time in the spotlight.Fallout games have traditionally kind of defaulted to one of a couple end game guns.  Heavy Plasma Gauss Rifles or that ridiculous . pistol that somehow managed to carry you through the whole damned game.  Fallout  was pretty much par for the course comparatively and New Vegas doesnt even need to be called out as exceptional.  Hell if New Vegas didnt exist I dont even think wed be having this discussion right now.Combat Rifle Assault Rifle Plasma Rifle and Combat Shotgun are all set up to be functional end game guns from what Ive experienced.  Maybe Plasma Pistol and the . too?  Not sure about how Pistols line up in the long run.  I think the real issue with the disparity is that Rifleman is ridiculous pairing high damage weapons which do well in the damage reduction formula already with reduced enemy resistances.  Should swap the armor reduction over to Commando and give Rifleman the stagger.  I think itd be a good start in giving some more weapon build variety.  The gatling weapons are generally trash in my experience because they get eaten alive by the damage reduction calculation and arent worth the zillion rounds it takes to kill anything.  Im giving the Gatling Laser a chance this playthrough and its better than the Minigun but were burning Fusion Cores here and thats a hard sell.Really the Double Barrel gets outclassed by the Combat Shotgun shortly after you get it but it isnt even the most outclassed weapon on the list.  Youd have to be in a pretty shitty situation to justify using the SMG or the Institute weapon.  Those things are terrible by the time you encounter them.,fo4,cxrf4co,2,t5_2tzv4

5889148,0,t3_3vxmla,I didnt expect to find such a controversy.  I guess my take on Fallout is a little different.  For me it has always been about the Vault.  The Vault emphasizes the drastic change between what youve believed all your life and the horror of how the world really is.  Even in  that element is still there maybe worse because you simply wake up one day without stories of the Wasteland and have to confront the real world.  It is the loss of innocence  and maybe themes about becoming an adult.  It is about facing the world as it is and now how you wanted it to be.  The Americanisms in the game are just simply decorations for me.  I love them dont get me wrong but the story of a sheltered child of the Vault surviving and conquering what is left of humanity is far more compelling.  That is what Fallout is.  Everything else is just a cute cat painting in your settlement.    ,fo4,cxrlnox,0,t5_2tzv4

Just one is what I have right now.With multiple settlements you can grow more obviously settlers must be assigned to the crops and can only tend to finite amounts.Second as you fast travel around them to harvest time flies by helping the other crops grow back. Ideally the settlements should be spaced distantly so that you can keep going around all of them and get regrowth in time you start the cycle anew.

There are actually a few points of no return based on who you want to be withBattle for Bunker Hill is a point of no return for most of the factions in the game. Based on how you do the quest you will make the Brotherhood andor Railroad hostile. The institute may still be friendly and the Minutemen dont care one way or the other what happens here.In Mass Fusion if you were not hostile to the Brotherhood at the end of Bunker Hill you have another choice to make which can make either the Institute hostile or the Brotherhood hostile.In Pinned should you continue with the Institute past Mass Fusion the outcome of the quest will anger the Minutemen in the immediate area and can lose a few companions depending on how you handle the situation. The entire Minuteman faction however remains unaffected. Personally I think this is a bug.,fo4,cxvraij,2,t5_2tzv4

Anybody can compare Minecraft to Barbies Wild Ride and tell you which is the better game.The bottom line is Skyrim has more quests than Fallout even though like . of them end up in a dungeon in the frozen fuckhole of Iceland fighting Draugur or those ugly little elves that ride the nasty centipedes. And all the things that made Skyrim good had to come in the form of DLC. Limitless crafting and house building already shipped with the vanilla copy of FO.

5942114,0,t3_3wqnjr,I have really enjoyed fo but with about  hours in im pretty much done with it. There really hasnt been much incentive to continue playing. The quest lines are forced on you through dialogue and continue on a fairly linear layout. On the flip side I have about  hours of skyrim with no mods logged and I still occasionally get that itch to play and im never disappointed when I do. Idk maybe its all the lore with the elder scrolls or maybe its that fallout is more shooter oriented than rpg but I had a lot more fun with skyrim,fo4,cxyjhnr,1,t5_2tzv4

I think all or the dialogue is fairly interesting and I never skip unless I accidentally didnt save and then died and had to relisten to it or something.

5952831,0,t1_cxz0upl,Personally I never use vats. Imo it kinda defeats the purpose of the combat. The hardest part of the game is the beginning before you have any points into defensive abilities. But since stimpacks are seemingly infinite and psycho and buff are easy enough to come by its fairly easy to stay alive even in tough situations.

5954557,0,t3_3wzbwb,I was under the impression that the Institute feels the outside world needs to be saved. They are constantly creating and upgrading these machines and the attempts to hide in plain site are for intel gathering. I mean if you could build synths you can build war machines and wipe out the wasteland pretty quick. The railroad treats these advance machines as intelligent life and therefore deserving of the same rights as humans. They are acting like humans from the history books that saved lives and in a time of very little humanity it would be seen as a just cause.

5975237,0,t3_3x9xet,Well for me at least its a good game. Not a great game but a good one. Leading up to launch I was excited for it loved seeing every new tidbet get leaked or released as a video. I went to my local midnight release in Traverse met a few decent folk there. Saw people younger than I  am and people pushing . We were so happy ecstatic about the release. What I expected was smoother gameplay better graphics and things hinted at in trailers. I now have about  days logged in and would say Ive tasted enough of general gameplay writing and atmosphere to be able to say I know the game well. It has advanced the gameplay and graphics from previous games but story and player agency have decreased as well as the world space in a way. Sound stayed the same in terms of quality for me at least. Its strengths lie in being a fun dungeon crawler with lovely graphics and an expanded crafting mechanic for the most part. What I see as glaring flaws that really got to me is a decrease in Player Character interaction with the world via decreased skill checks and player choice too morally grey factions that are damned if you do damned if you dont types that are by and large unlikable and a world that feels built up just for you to kill loot repeat forever. Admittedly that last bit could be commentary on us like the speech on Dragon kinds need to dominate. So for me and it really pained me to realize this this game is just not an RPG. We dont play a self insert but a parent who lost their loved ones that we can choose to act in a very limited fashion. The story of the family honestly made me cry I felt my characters pain but its not my story not my role. Fallout  is a good open world adventure game that harkens back to classic dungeoning tabletop games but it lacks in the roleplaying elements that mark a true RPG.,fo4,cy2vvb9,1,t5_2tzv4

Just keep in mind that  fps is max for the game unless you adjust settings.The games script engine is linked to the framerate.  From what I have read disabling Vsync or using windows mode can increase fps.  But doing so also increases the speed at which scripts and actions are run at.   fps doesnt seem to cause much of an issue.  Getting up towards  fps you can notice gravity acting faster and the player moving faster then intended.,fo4,cy3kksd,-1,t5_2tzv4

Build up the castle re enforce all walls and build lots of defenses on the walls  I have around  defense rating with heavy MG laser and mssile turrets. Install the settlement raid mod which enables you to manually trigger raids at the castle and Sanctuary Buy a rocket launcher or equip yourself with nukes.Now you are ready for the followingClimb the wall near the entrance equip your big bang gun. Enter bat CAI in the console to launch an insane robot attack. Fire some rounds into the crowd immediatley after it appears and then quickly step back. As soon as the first robot explodes the whole crowd will explode sometimes taking you with it. You can trigger such a mass explosion on all four bunches of robots appearing.Improtant Save your game because sometimes you hit a settler by accident and then the mob kills you after it.Result lots of loot including legendary items and around  level ups with level  here per run. If everything works fine the whole attack takes less than  minutes.Side note even if you dont want to level up the firework is cool. Wanna see the whole area in flames?

Just the ones that they felt were too contaminated by FEV. Its not too farfetched to think that they would start to decide who was and wasnt pure human enough.

If you compare it to Kremvhs Tooth the Shishkebab is a joke and Kremvhs is pretty easy obtainable. Even Pickmans Blade is stronger and it is a fucking knife. You can add to this the fact that you can remove the blades of both these weapons and put them on other legendary ones to make them even better... and they arent even the only ones that are stronger than the shishkebab.Also Im yet to see a legendary shishkebab in the game. I was really excited when I saw that guy in Saugus with it but it was a big disappointment. I think Bethesda really dropped the ball on this one.,fo4,cye82g5,1,t5_2tzv4

We literally carry everything to build entire settlements on our backs having a ton of concrete and two dozen telephones stashes away. That to me seems unimmersive as well. So as we actually need the junk in this game Id rather imagine I have a brahmin following me around to carry this stuff.

6127897,0,t3_3zfbeu,Point by point Ammendment  ArgumentLOOTING PARTIESI like this idea but would expand its potential.  You could evolve the caravan system into tiersBasic Caravan  Characteristics and behaviors are not different than the current system.Scavenging Parties  Each settlement can have a maximum of  SPs.  Assign up to  settlers  the quantity and quality of loot would depend on the number  to canvas a single a location  type of loot would depend on the location i.e. Saugus Ironworks would produce crafting material National Guard Armory would produce weapons etc.  and bring back the loot within hr IGT  again depending on the distance from originating settlement.  SPs will need to be well armed and protected in the event that specified location becomes reinhabited by raiders or super mutants and failure to properly equip may result in a failure to acquire any loot and loss of a party member.  Also in order to prevent overscavenging spamming each location can only be selected once ever  designations.Raiding Parties  Only  RP per settlement !. Same characteristics as SPs however RPs can be sent to hostilenonfaction settlements to loot.  Success of looting will depend heavily on the RPs offensedefense statistics.The idea of developing Raiding Parties resurfaces a commonly referred to notion of Home basesettlements which I think should definitely be addressed and could further enhance the experiences for each party.REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCEI agree that settlement maintenance and repair is something that could be assigned to settler.  But the need to repair only occurs after an attack what if you settle rarely or never attacked?  You would basically have a nonproductive settler until such an event occurred.  Instead of just waiting until after an attack have the Engineer repair all equipment and structures that degrade over time  not so much or so rapidly that it becomes a major burden but if you have a relatively healthy stockpile of resources it can be easily maintained without to much if any oversight.ARMORY and AUTOMATIC MAXING OUT OF SETTLER EQUIPMENTIn theory this idea has some potential.  But there are too many complications and contradictions within the logistics of it allMost players tend to stockpile their weapons an armor in one location.  Which means while that settlement maybe well fortified if workshop rules are to remain the same and built structures equipment and weapons do not transfer via supply lines other settlements in your network will not have the same benefit.What would be the criteria and circumstance for determining the better weapons and armor?  In your example you used DMG for weapons but those stats DMG in particular are flawed.  Statistically excluding Legendary weapons PlasmagtBallisticgtEnergy and on top of that HandgunsgtRifles.  This is also excluding explosive projectile weapons and melee weapons but I dont think you would want to your guards carrying Fat Mans or Super Sledges.  Unless we are ignoring physics and before you use the counter are you really arguing physics in a video game? Yes... yes I am. there is no reason an energy weapon should do less damage than even the largest of ballistic weapons.  Also some enemies have resistances to certain types of DMG.  Although Ive not noticed it to have much of an impact the games computing system would still consider that variable.  These same arguments can be used to argue that value of armor also. I dont really have a counter solution.  Just wanted to argue that there are too many variables to consider and I think that its best to be left to the player equip settlers with whatever weapon and armor they choose.BOTSValid an valuable idea.  I only have a couple commentssuggestionsLimit the number of bots in each settlement.  If your bots occupy all the assignments in your settlement then your settlers will have nothing to do except get fat and lazy have you seen the movie WallE?.Robots are somewhat autonomous from your settlements infrastructure but you could build docks that connect to your terminals in order assign personalities in the case of protections or patrols.  Also because they are not always connected to your grid and I would imagine do not possess an infinite energy source they would need to return to their docks every so often to recharge or to be reassigned.  Or you could establish a wireless system but than that would negate the need to resend them.  However I still think its more realistic to have to recharge a robot  plus I would like having more things with which to decorate my settlements.DEAD BODIES ATTRACT ANIMALSA viable solution however I would imagine after extinguishing the various enemy hordes across the commonwealth you would find yourself running into scavenging animals more frequently and at almost every location your revisit.  It would just becomes a vicious cycle. gt Oh look!  That Yao Guai is eating that raider I killed a week ago... and now hes trying to eat me too.  I guess I will just have to add him to rest of the decomposing corpses.  Just use the bloody mess perk.  That way you can just imagine the dilapidated bodies being kicked aside into the piles of other junk and trash that litter the wasteland.TRADERS COLLECT WHAT YOU LEAVE BEHINDTo what end?  The only way I could see it effecting anything is if you happen to come upon that trader later theyve sold or traded what you dropped because you clearly didnt value it enough to keep it in order to get other items.  Doesnt the game refresh vendor inventory already?PROPER BURIALUnless the Institute had somehow devised a way to repair the damages of a bullet to the brain I think we can rule out with some certainty the Synth spouse option.  In Curie case she was an AI that had her CPUI transferred into a Synth shell.  Aside from that the cryotube is essentially an upright hermetically sealed casket  There is no reason except for sentimental purposes to bury your spouse.MISC ITEMS ORGANISEDHolotapes could do with their own tab.  And turretrobot override codes could be more easily accessed via hotkeys on the games interface.  Aside from that keys key cards and pass codes are used automatically and then become irrelevant so there really isnt much of a need to display any other miscellaneous item.  As for storing these items most of them do not have any weight so the player doesnt really consider them until they become important.  Im OK with a lengthy browse through my inventory for something as long I know it doesnt cost me anything to carry it.BETTER RAIDER  BANDIT INTERACTIONI think this is somewhat inconsistent with the RaiderSuper Mutant character.  If they had the common sense to parlay before potentially turning hostile then they wouldnt be raiders they would be normal Commonwealth citizens.  I can recall few instances were the raiders and mutants were not the ones to shoot first.  Sure there have been plenty of times where Ive given an unsuspecting raider a . caliber eye exam from yrds but thats only because I know that if I get close enough for them to notice me there isnt going to be any polite conversation.In saying all this I do recall the incident at Drumlin Diner... so maybe there is hope for the miscreants of the wasteland.,fo4,cym6fgf,1,t5_2tzv4

Not sure the only settler Ive had die so far was a Synth that snuck in to Sanctuary Hills. Oh and youll get a substantial Happiness penalty for not defending them and I think if it gets low enough settlers will leave. Do be aware if you leave any gear out it can be taken either by settlers or attackers. So be sure to put any weapons armor aid or other gear into containers to prevent that from happening. Also be sure to take the Fusion Core out of any Power Armor you are not using so that neither settlers nor attackers can use it. ,fo4,cynasz6,1,t5_2tzv4

6195992,0,t1_cytwx9c,Theres a method to duplicate items using Dogmeat. Pretty much anything can be duped but he only dupes ammo one bullet at a time. Duping Power Armor is a real pain in the ass because the larger hitbox makes the timing very very tight.Basically drop the item you wish to dupe command Dogmeat away from you then back up until the cursor changes to a command for him to pick it up. Command him to do so then move forward until the cursor changes so that you can pick it up. Wait until the moment before he bows his head to pick it up then grab it. He will also do so. Boom duped. If timed right.Pro tip dupe shipments then store one of each in a container once placed in the workshop they become the materials. If stored in a container they remain shipment lists and are easily duped. I hang onto shipments of the rarer items such as nuclear materials and the stuff you use lots of like aluminum and copper.Another handy thing to dupe is the YOURE S.P.E.C.I.A.L. book you found in Sanctuary. Bear in mind that if duping this the version in your inventory is the dupe so you will have to drop it and then pick it up again to put  into a stat.If using this to dupe Power Armor be aware its a fucking proper pain in the ass the timing is really tight. But it can be done.,fo4,cytx2mo,1,t5_2tzv4

6207788,0,t3_40mbte,Its an open world game.  You can make your own quests by just exploring and discovering new things to do.  Maybe you find a guided grasshopper.  Or maybe you find a huge shipwreck run by robots with a gazillion quests.  Or you might find an old codger with a gun he has named after a country singer.  You could also run into a kid trapped in a refrigerator or maybe a gang of s style cool cats with awesome power armor mods.  You might even find around  hidden locations or maybe a crashed alien.  Look I will agree.  If you want spoon fed quests along a scripted story line this isnt the game for you.  I have named a very small percentage of what you could run into around the commonwealth.  If you just simply listen to what people say as you walk by you might discover a haunted museum with a nice surprise inside.  You can try to collect all of the bobble heads or perk magazines.  You can also do all of the companion quests.  If those arent enough how about saving a boy from a disease?  Or perhaps finding a lost treasure hidden behind a maze of traps?  If thats not good enough how about trying to locate a high tech weapon that was a target of Institute thievery while discovering how truly evil the Institute can be?  Or heck  how about making an awesome piece of chest armor by mixing the exact chemicals necessary?I wont even stop there.  You want a robot that serves beverages?  Bingo.  Ever wondered what a mutated fern is good for?  Care to find out what happened in Quincy?  Maybe even make those bastards pay for what they did?  I mean geezus I could go on and on and on. RE other reply ...Lack of original quests?  Replaced with rinse and repeat?  Are you serious?  Good lord man.  Yeah if you want linear spoon fed then try Sonic or Mario.

So all your ini tweaks will be handily in one file for you to edit instead of spread throughout the original ones.Makes it fairly trivial to copypaste tweaks personally Ive enabled mods implemented the mouse YAxis and acceleration fix changed the FoV to  and skipped things that delay starting the game such as input being disabled for a few seconds for some godforsaken reason so you can stare at the loading screen saying press any key before finally being able to pull the menu up.Beyond that Nexus Mod Manager makes it almost trivial to grab whatever mods you want like changing the Workbench UI so your WeaponArmor mods show things like  Recoil or  Recoil instead of reduces recoil and greatly reduces recoil.Mods are a godsend I had a nice supply chain going which suddenly bugged out and deprived my settlements of food and water plunging a half dozen into the red.

The people of the Commonwealth have recently nicknamed it the Great Granite Star.It serves as both the Minutemens HQ and as the capital of the Commonwealth Collective Communities a loose organization of settlements protected and governed by the Minutemen.The Castle is divided into three districtsThe Yard located in the Castle Courtyard A district where the majority of civilians live it is cramped and claustrophobic houses are stacked on top of each other and thin alleyways curve all throughout. Home to Liberty Traders on of the largest stores in the Commonwealth.The Bastion located within The Castles walls A district where few call home but those few are very rich and very powerful. A number of the most successful shops in the Yard are owned and operated by residents of the Bastion.The Battlements located mainly atop the Castles Walls A small part of this district is located within the Castles walls where the barracks reside the majority of the district is however found on top of the Castles walls. Only Minutemen are allowed access to the Battlements it is where they patrol and where they call home.The Castle is an important new addition to this world and with the founding of the Commonwealth Collective a united Commonwealth might soon be a reality.Hope you all enjoy my build!

I think its missing the armorers workbench.. could be wrong.  But you will encounter workbenches of various types all over the place.  Even Raider camps have various ones and theres a PA one in Corvega but I wasnt able to exit my suit there.... not sure why.

6272824,0,t3_41g94h,Invest however many points into luck for the idiot savant only  into intelligence. About  or  in charisma and the rest into strength you will not believe how entertaining it is. On top of all this if you want to go for bonus points try to be drunk allll the time because your dialogue changes when your character is inebriated. Bonus bonus points if you take the drug you find as soon as you find them makes the game a tad more interesting and gives you reasons to find in game doctors or just nerf your character a bit.And if you want to make it even more challenging play on survival difficulty and block out your radar I use three playing cards this way when your looking for enemies youre not just spinning around looking at the radar. It makes the game so much more immersive. You end up scouring the halls of ruins and gives the game jump scares.,fo4,cz2ndw7,1,t5_2tzv4

Avoid the south of the map until at least level  the enemies there kick ass and chew bubblegum and theyre all outta gum. Take any perks involving crafting ASAP you need them to unlock some of the more exotic mods for your gear. If you see enemies with skulls next to their names run or make sure they cant reach you.

Current law in the US defines a corporation as an entity with rights. And the fact is that even the most heavily researched methods to differentiate synths from humans SAFE only has what a  success rate? At that point it isnt about sentience its about human egotism. I cant honestly answer this question as Ive only gotten as far as Reunions main questline. So in absence of details Id say I support the cause of the Railroad insofar as I agree with the fact that the enslavement of a sentient race is immoral and unforgivable and that the Institution deserves its fate.

Its too easy to both find more junk amp raise your charisma for a trade to hoard items for sale.i.e. Just before trading put on glasses hat amp suit for charisma. Use beer the mentat that gives  charisma amp Day tripper  for another  charisma. Thats  charisma from transients. So your own charisma is less relevant unless you plan to wait till you have charisma...  The Concord SpeakEasy respawns daytripper spoilerAs a general rule caps are not a limit in FO At any given moment you might be short a few  caps. But if you really want to put time into it you can quickly get more than you can spend. Thats why there are no on line spread sheets showing costprofit ratios on various items. Most players pick one or two items they can easily obtain and ignore the rest.  gt Values of crafted Aid items compared to their ingredients.Some crafted aid is worth a lot more than the sum of its ingredients e.g. Jet Others are not e.g BuffJetMost cooked food is worth more than its raw ingredients. Stimpaks are worth a significant amount and most character builds use far more than they find. e.g. when buying a K legendry item I usually get  or K of that by trading stimpaks. Some mods are valuable when detached amp sold e.g. the standard mining hat light sells for more than Jetspoiler So you could gain experience for crafting a replacement mod and make a caps profit at the same time.  ,fo4,czr1zgq,3,t5_2tzv4

No one else is capable of making such determinations. Youre absolving yourself of all responsibility to make an important decision simply because it is difficult and in the process youre basically assuring the decision will never actually be made.And worse STILL you actually ARE making that determination youre just pretending youre not.

6532713,0,t3_4547cv,Eh it all depends on how you want to play it.If you plan on hoarding and settlements youll want to get all of the Strong Back perks as soon as possible. Other than that Im not sure what I can recommend for you.,fo4,czv197e,1,t5_2tzv4

6534177,0,t3_4547cv,Strength is the tree for heavy weapons melee and unarmed characters.  The Strong Back perk is a huge convenience factor however as the ability to run or fast travel while overloaded makes looting a snap.Perception affects VATS accuracy but the primary use in my mind is the Lockpick skill.  Lockpick  is going to increase the number of safes you can loot  safes that include a fair amount of money and ammo including sometimes fusion cores.  You need a  in PER to get Lockpick.Endurance is mostly about hit points.  The perks are really not that interesting.  Aquaboy is probably the most useful but Im playing on Very Hard with a  END.  I took a single level of Toughness and have otherwise ignored it without too much angst.  If you prefer to be a damage sponge then invest in it or if youre really keen on cannibalism I guess.Charisma is used for a your ability to persuade people b your purchase price at vendors and c the Local Leader perk which is key for building settlements.  Persuasion only affects either the number of caps you get paid for a quest or how happyunhappy the quest ending is.  You can use Grape Mentats and clothes to help with merchants.  Charisma is a nice convenience stat with some amusing perks but only really critical if you love settlements.Intelligence has some good perks.  Gun Nut and Scrapper are both great if you like modding guns which you will unless you want to pay attention to every dropped gun to see if it has a better mod for your own gun.  Science! is really nice for energy weapons and power armor mods and needed for some settlement improvements.      Medic and Hacker are good allaround utility perks.  Nuclear Physicist  requires a really high intelligence but it makes fusion cores last up to twice as long in power armor.  Intelligence also affects your XP reward  so if you skimp here make sure you take Idiot Savant early.Agility is all about action points  and even if you dont like VATS you use action points for sprinting for running with Strong Back for holding sniper scopes steady and for using your power armor jet pack.  Gunslinger is a good perk because your first gun is a mm pistol and that will last a long while with mods.  Commando can wait as you probably wont have enough of any ammo other than . at first to really exploit it.  Action Boy is nice but not as nice as it was in earlier games.  If you like stealth then Agility is also a good stat.Luck is kind of weird.  Idiot Savant is worth taking regardless of your intelligence the math shows that the XP bonus is worth it even with high INT.  Fortune Finder and Scrounger can make the early game a little easier  especially if you dont want to take the water farmerjet dealer approach to earning massive amounts of caps.  If you like VATS then Critical Banker is really really nice but it is also really really specific to VATS and critical hits.So what kind of character do you want to play?  Max out on STR and END if you want a brawler.  Max out on INT and CHA if you want a talkerleader.  Max out on AGI for a stealth character.  Max out on LUC if you want random benefits to happen like mysterious strangers saving you or bullets ricocheting back to hit foes.  Max out on PER and AGI for a shootersniper.  Note that when I say max I suggest you put no more than  into any SPECIAL stat as you may otherwise overspecialize.,fo4,czv6pn2,5,t5_2tzv4

I told Preston alone that I only wanted to be friends like  times during the game.  My Radiant Quest was friendzoning him for  hours.What are the many others because so far I count .Yes they took four options as an absolute rule not a general onIts actually YES  YES  WHAT? YES  NO BUT OFTEN STILL YESMy favorite dialogues are the ones where you say no and then they just keep going as if youd said yes without even referencing your negative response.  I ran into a couple of those before I gave up on a second playthrough.edit I dont think I ever played an INT  character in NV.  I guess if youre trying to wildly metagame and be so good at everything that you have every single option at any given moment but otherwise the game is balanced around your skills being HighAverageLow depending on how late game the choices are because they assume someone is sort of maybe roleplaying.  Even with INT  you end up missing other high SPECIAL based options which dont care about skills.  Doesnt NV have perk that lets you use Charisma to bullshit your way through INT checks or am I thinking of a different Fallout.,fo4,czvp84x,1,t5_2tzv4

6590970,0,t1_d00z7cl,I wouldnt worry about building up Sanctuary too much at the start.  Just have the basic things such as  a farming area another for water.  Put   turrets at those locations.  Id also suggest at least one turret higher up on the culdesac  if you have sufficient materials to build them.I found equipping your settlers with better weapons in addition to a siren was a good defense.  If theyre equipped with automatic weapons shotguns combat rifles etc theyll be able to take down most of the attacks on Sanctuary since those are lowlevel monsters.,fo4,d0126i0,1,t5_2tzv4

6592796,0,t3_45xu48, definitely. I dont have a particular longing for this but itd be a neat mechanic if implemented well. I didnt know I wanted this until now. Gimme. this reminds me of Fallout Shelter. Id like this but at the same time I also like being able to place my favourite settlers in certain jobs and least favourite in others. Having them tied to a skill set would restrict how free I am to assign them to things unless they can also accumulate skills over time depending on their tasks. this would be interesting on the new survival mode overhaul. Its already introducing diseases so hey. definitely. Random events make me feel more involved in a game and gives it more replayability or at least a reason to keep playing it. Itd also make the settlers feel like real people and not rehashes of each other especially if they built up reputation over time or something and the settlers commented about them. Unlikely to happen though anything that involves more voice acting is probably a big no. nah that already happens to an extent and it doesnt add any enjoyment or immersion to the game. thats what the scavenging station is for. They dont leave of course but its the same concept. something Id love to have is named settlers or the ability to name settlers yourself. Id want this even more if tied in with your . another thing Id want but very unlikely is the ability to recruit randomly generated wandering settlers. Sort of like how you can employ legendary traders maybe there could be some special settlers with references to past games like MacCready that you could encounter on the road and offer a home to. Or just more character models. Please Bethesda. I dont need identical quadruplets in my town.,fo4,d018zfg,1,t5_2tzv4

Since Im a hoarder of all things I had PLENTY on my I count at least  or more before entering the hospital for some reason one of the Super Mutants just outside that area had a hit. So I literally used it as soon as I opened the first elevator once it stopped and kept hitting up once it ran out. I figured it might be worth a shot since the first time the mission failed I was at the last elevator door going down so I was already going at a decent speed. As long as you know the layout of the building and where to go just Jet up and run through it. I managed to make it to Sinjin and work through the dialogue like everyone else.

Behemoths lie down Deathclaws cry at you Ghouls just stare and hiss. Assaultrons are still dangerous but its much easier to dodge their deathray when they cant move or turn very fast. Human enemies with guns still shoot back but they stop being able to run for cover or flank you.I got a Kneecapping Combat Rifle shortly after reaching Diamond City. I think it only did like  damage but with a reflex sight it was accurate enough to snipe with at medium range and great for close quarters.

6644790,0,t3_46l2bf,I dont think it would be a wrong assumption to make that Danse and the Railroad have already crossed paths in past. He came from outside the Commonwealth. The Railroads MO is to reprogram escaped synths with new memories and send them out the Commonwealth. Its never said but I think its reasonable that he has escaped the Institute and gone through the RR already. The RR dont keep track of synths they rescue. Once they have new memoriesfaceswhatever they are sent away and thats where any support from the RR ends.In Blind Betrayal literally the only thing that stops Danse from either suiciding or suiciding by cop is his relationship with you. It becomes even more clearer with the dialog you get if you romance him that you are all he has left in the world and the only reason he wishes to remain in it. I think if you were to put forward any idea that he would have to give up you as well and start again he would reject it. He already knows how broken the process is. He blames the Institute for not programming him with memories of family etc but I suspect thats actually the RRs doing. They sent him out in the world and he gravitated to the one organisation that is the most dangerous not only to himself but to other synths. With that thought I really wouldnt trust the process again.I dont dislike the Railroad enought o want to destroy them but their whole setup causes far more problems than it actually solves. They dont help synths. They move the problem to somewhere else.,fo4,d06mng8,1,t5_2tzv4

6649396,0,t1_d070xn2,I dont think they are idiots. DLCs can be good but a lot are bad most of the time they are just not worth the price. Look at the Witcher  additional content they released a ton of DLCs for free and two paid ones that are both inexpensive while giving at least  hours of new content. There are multiple problems with Bethesda. They have a history of making bad DLCs since Oblivion and while they made a notable effort lately Skyrim had some great dlcs I guess people are scared and might be right to be so when you see the efforts made by the company to make money on their licences paid mods being one of the last debatable part. . Even though the DLCs looks kind of promising on paper its still hard to forget the fact that they feel like the kind of mods we were expecting anyways.  DLCs are adding in total more customization for settlements and two side quests. Well have to see I guess but again check that against Witcher  and the first DLC which had several new quests around  characters gameplay mechanisms etc. . Lastly I guess people are still disappointed in the path Bethesda chose for their DLCs. Nothing major in the area of gameplay  storytelling  roleplay. A lot of people were very underwhelmed with Fallout  because it distanced itself from the origins of the Fallout franchise to become a sort of postapocalyptic Skyrim with an emphasis on combats and a lack of choices. It was received quite negatively by the press and players too in comparison with the other Bethesda games anyway. My two favorites reviews a press magazine and a french website gave it  and  respectively.  So it feels weird that they continue producing paid content when their game was lacking a lot of things in the first place. Some other companies would have went a different way with a bunch of free content to make up for the initial disappointment and then a couple of highvalue dlcs. ,fo4,d073smm,1,t5_2tzv4

Some things I have done that have helped me keep the experience fresh though. switch up weapon classes. You dont NEED the commando perk to use an automatic weapon you dont NEED Big Leaugues to use a melee weapon. I like to carry one of each type so that each combat situation has multiple ways to handle.. talk to EVERYBODY. I dont care how boring or unimportant that NPC in the corner looks chances are he has some miniquest or other fetchkill opportunity for you.. Fast travel as little as possible. I know getting to that marker across the map seems like a big drag but its way more fun to hoof it and murder everything you can along the way rather than zip to it and miss out on some great encounters.. Dont get shoehorned into the vanilla storyline! Just because Bethesda tells you this is a poor lost soul just searching for his family doesnt mean you cant be the Commonwealths next dictator! Be an asshole! kill everybody! If thats not your style experiment with the different factions and see which one you really want to side with. Theyre all pretty grey morally so theres no right or wrong faction.. Settlements! Theyre not just for show! You can useabuse your little wastelanders in so many ways. Start a sweatshop! Build a beachside resort! Capitalize on production with jetwater farms and buy up every market!. Dont force it. If things start to get tedious or it starts to seem like more of a chore then put it down. Youll know when to pick it up again. God speed fellow wastelander and good luck! ,fo4,d07r5zm,2,t5_2tzv4

Now this gets tricky and can be game breaking but it also makes it extremely challenging. Just be careful when going to Danse the first time cause he is like supposed to get downed?

Healing in the glowing sea as a ghoul was fantastic and not wearing power armor!WeatherTrue Storms  just a must for those who like really awesome fuckin lightening storms while hunting super mutants.

6664498,0,t1_d0847bl,Yes exactly this. I dont understand it either. Mercenaries are guns for hire. If you cant get near them without being shot then how do they even get business?  I know they spat the dummy over caravans ripping them off and I know they have had some leadership changes which may be bringing about some of the change but they are too well set up trained kitted out and provisioned to be nothing more than upgraded raiders. It would be awesome if they became a side faction you could get involved in as an after main story activity rather like the Thieves Guild dark Brotherhood etc in skyrim. Factions that have no link to the main story. The various ways the Main Story can be played out gives plenty of reasons why a player character could be over everyone elses shit and want to gravitate toward something like becoming a Merc leader. They could be used for settlement security instead of tying up settlers who could be tending crops and producing more foodtrade. They could be escorting provisioners. You could have radiant missions based on contracts. They dont have to be a good faction but they could be one put to better use.,fo4,d08o0ag,1,t5_2tzv4

Blitz  increases your damage by quite a lot from longer ranges.If you want to truly maximise damage I did this a while ago though this is obviously only under very extreme conditions.

6721678,0,t3_47o7tr,Generally the perks that dont scale are the worst. Like. Duh. Gaming .Life giver for example stops being better than a simple point of endurance around level .  Damage resistance cant compete with the all mighty ballistic weave.Crafting perks are fun but you dont reallllllly need them. There are plenty of opportunities to find all the wrapon mods you need. The only exception are with ballistic weave and power armor mods which you need armor crafting for.Perks that kinda make things more convenient or save you caps once in a while are pretty much useless. So you need fewer rad packs or stim packs. So what. Nothing can compare to the all mighty game breaking wealth of purified water. One point in science is all you need to crank infinite wealth up to .Damage perks are always good. Carry limit perks have their place but arent anything more special than infinite water wealth. Anything that says boosts X by  is undeniably great. Town building perks unlock a fun if poorly implemented part of the game. Crit perks have their place. Stealth and melee perks have their place.Overall the weakest tree in terms of mechanics has to be endurance. Everything else has something totally game breaking that you can do with it.

BOSLogicgtTwo the guy still has morals.Define morals.gtElder Maxson is undeniable a brilliant tacticianHa ha ha... no.He barges right into the commonwealth on his big flying target sends Vertibirds to scour the commonwealth to engage in fights with enemies that have nothing to do with his primary mission of destroying the Institute something that wasnt really a threat to the BOS to begin with until he decided to make them such. Unlike the Enclave and Master who would have targeted the BOS on their own the Institute did not care about the BOS. Thus he created his own enemy in the Institute and on top of that intends on blowing up the Institute rather than capture it andor occupying it andor taking the salvage thus making this entire trip have very little to no material gain something that is strategically stupid considering this is an organization that survives purely on what they can salvage or pilfer off the locals. And in the Minutemen ending he keeps his airship right in the middle of a hostile artillery grid instead of moving it at the first opportunity.Maxon is a tactical idiot despite what his propaganda and yesmen have to say.gt But he does say that he cares about the people of the Commonwealth Its called Bullshiting.  tactic of politicians.Sorry but when it comes right down to it Maxons words are beyond empty.gtbut he also tries to help civilians.No he doesnt. Not really.gtthe Brotherhood of Steel has spread all across the eastern coast and I doubt he just went in and conquered everything.Why not? He seems pretty intent on doing exactly that with the Commonwealth.

Why bother fighting the challenging boss? None of these things will give you better or unique items. At that point its a short leap to wondering why youre even playing the game. DA inquisition had the same problem. The unique drops were trash next to my crafted infinity  sword so why bother? It killed the endgame for me and youll be sidestepping that quite adroitly.

You can also use the siren as a switch to turn on dormant defenses like if you want to keep your defense number low to draw more attacks but have it all power on automatically just put a siren inbetween the power and the powered defenses and make sure settlers can reach it too and then they will be powered up by a settler when someone is attacking. ,fo4,d0odvf8,2,t5_2tzv4

6860727,0,t1_d0tx6ic,gtcompared to Fallout Heres probably where most of the misunderstanding comes in. Fallout  blows Fallout  out of the water  in most places. And in the places it doesnt New Vegas blows those aspects out of the water. If you cant tell Fallout  is my least favorite modern Fallout game. Straight out of the Vault Megaton is seemingly screaming Look at us! We did an RPG! Make a choice! Its an extremely black and white choice as is the ending. Extremely obvious choices like this that dont affect much though Ill give it credit many of Fallout s do are only a bit better than no choices IMO  in general not just in Fallout . This is why Im basing many of my complaints off of whats in New Vegas  because those are the kinds of things I look for and love in a Fallout game. Before I get into that Ill explain something. Fallout  improves almost everything Fallout  had and adds innovative great new ideas. My main gripe with things not in Fallout  that were in Fallout  is checks. I only saw one quest with a check other than speechCharisma. Im not even mad about skills still on the fence about that would prefer Skyrims system above all I just want checks whether they be SPECIAL or perks. But overall  is so much better than  IMO. They based things off of mods improved and streamlined existing things and looked at complaints about black and white factions and choices and a bland story and fixed them. It took some sacrifice roleplay some understandable dialogue restrictions to add a voiced protagonist and therefore a more effective story but it was worth it for the most part. I even like the story maybe not the plot but the effect of it better than New Vegas marginally it was kinda cheap how they just reversed Fallout s though. Like you said made things opaque.My problem is that they either didnt see or ignored improvements that New Vegas made over Fallout . If you cant tell New Vegas is my favorite Fallout game and probably overall favorite. Obsidian went to huge lengths to bring back things like more choices more options in dialogue and quests that effect things more checks for every skill and SPECIAL and other traditional RPG elements. And Fallout  just ignores it all! Except craftingcustomization s craftingcustomization is like x better than NVs. While there is some excuse for it having to make cuts because of voiced protagonist but it cut out a lot of things like that even moreso than Fallout  IMO. It truly does have nice yes mean yes question yes and more money yes as options. When I say cut content I dont mean anything from  for the most part. I mean things that I and many others had assumed they would add because it made NV so great. The lack of this stuff makes Fallout  less deep more linear in story the world is fantastic another thing it does better than NV for the most part and less like an RPG in general.,fo4,d0tz0zu,1,t5_2tzv4

Humanlike body emotions etc theyre all just pretty much programmed.And the big argument that the synth component is the only difference between humans and synths Im genuinely curious can they survive without that part?

6992634,0,t1_d18ojuv,It turns side quests into self contained stories and not a blur you kind of see as you speed past.When you have to plan your travel break it into blocks of hunting eating drinking and sleeping then the most boring side quest becomes an epic adventure.I play Skyrim that way using Frostfall iNeeds etc etc. Morning is breakfast and a drink pack up camp travel until about pm if I havent seen any game along the way then pmpm is hunting time. If I have nailed a deer then I keep travelling until about pm collect some wood and setup camp. Have some dinner a drink then lay in bed and read a bookplan out the next days travel what clothing Im going to need if conditions are going to be harsh where I can refill my water and any possible hunting grounds along the way. I only ever WALK so I can take in the world.It turns go to X and kill Y quests into amazing adventures where you really see the world which was created. A simple quest like that can run me up to  hours of gameplay and have me taking on challenges I never thought the game was capable of providing without even thinking of the combat at the end. I know that kind of gameplay isnt for everybody but you wouldnt believe how much you miss when you set a compass marker and start running. ,fo4,d18yhej,4,t5_2tzv4

6998533,0,t3_4bi1ij,So just a quick update. After doing soft and hard resets clearing information and ultimately deleting the game file a few things have changed.. The DLC became available to download and I did so successfully. It shows up in the FO directory now as well as the Addon slot on the main menu.  . I still cannot sync. It gets to about  then states theres an issue and to either retry or play offline. Because of this there is no access to offline local save files that were previously there. im guessing theyre stuck somewhere between the cloud and the Xbox. Doesnt matter I presume theyre gone.  . Hell probably wind up restarting the game and Im not really sure how thatll go over in the long run. I know he doesnt mind but if it tries to sync fails then wipes the data again then... well I did some searching and found other people have had similar issues where their games would wipe data off failed or mismatched syncs. I noticed it was heavily in the Minecraft community but pretty rampant elsewhere. Ive tried everything Ive found and to no avail. The only other options we have is to factor reset the device and to play the waiting game. The forum I saw from the MC community said they contact Xbox Customer Service and they couldnt do anything. Makes me wish he wouldve just gone with Sony now what a mess.,fo4,d19mlce,1,t5_2tzv4

Kellogg is using Old Man explicitly to refer to whoever gave the orders when he originally entered the vault and kidnapped Shaun so regardless of which Kellogg past Kellogg or present Kellogg is speaking he absolutely cannot possibly be referring to Shaun because Shaun was at that time a frozen infant who could not order his own kidnapping.I think the easy answer is that anyone who becomes the director of the Institute is probably pretty old so hes just referring to whoever the director at the time was. ,fo4,d1e4wkk,3,t5_2tzv4

7042869,0,t1_d1ej8ey,I dont care who says what a Synth isnt a human. I dont care if you constructed it to be as close as possible to a human it isnt one. Take that chip out of their brain they shut down. There is no chip to take out of a human brain. Its also not individuality and consciousness too. It was created. Arguably the individuality and consciousness brought to a Synth is by extension the human designers individuality and consciousness thus not making them truly individual unlike a human. I see your logic however theres a spiritual angle that I cant rationalize that disallows me to equate Synths with humans.Also remember that Elder Maxson is actually not the leader of the real BOS hes the leader of the East Chapter which is an entirely separate group than from the NCR BOS which I regard as the actual BOS and why I hate them in the first place. Elder Maxson upon gaining the title modeled his BOS to be more like the NCR BOS but this is the BOS the Wasteland doesnt need. Its the Elder Lyons BOS that I respected the most. If it was Elder Lyonss BOS that was still running the East Chapter Id have chosen them hands down. Theyd have found a way to work with the Institute not destroy abominations. The Scribe the level  armorer merchant you find and can assign to your armor emporium left the BOS because of this change. Id have done the same.Plus with the BOS its much harder to control divisiveness the East Chapter being the one of the offshoots of the BOS the Outcasts being another. With the Institute if the humans who were born raised and grew up in the environment like the Institute you have way more control. Banish them if they dont jump on board with using Institute technology to help the Commonwealth. They wouldnt last a week out there with all the crap thats in the Wasteland. Think of it and I made this example in a previous post like a teenager who refuses to do what you tell them to do. Sure yeah they can run away but theyll come crawling back hat in hand because they dont have a clue what it takes to live and survive out in the real world with absolutely no support.I feel like if the Institute made themselves more open and less secretive which begins to happen if you take the Institute track to not spoil anything else remember Diamond City if you chose the Institute the problems of mistrust would begin to dissipate. Itd be slow but progress could arguably be made.,fo4,d1eo021,3,t5_2tzv4

Furthermore assuming a BoS patrol did run in with Railroad agents or tourists how exactly do they know theyre with the Railroad? The BoS wear their flag with pride but the Railroad are always in normal clothing or disguises with the exception to Glory and the Heavies that fight alongside you at the Battle of Bunker Hill and other actual large engagements.    gt Its funny how you accuse me of turning to insults when ever you come of as a condescending prick.

7047859,0,t1_d1ewrnf,gtThe goal is to free people who are being enslaved. The synths are not just tools. They have no inherent obligation to fix the Commonwealth or to allow themselves to be used by Wastelanders as penance for daring to have been created by the Institute. And synths dont have all this tech. The Institute does. When a synth escapes the Institute all they have is some builtin benefits that really only help them e.g. not needing to eat and the knowledge of whatever job the Institute trained them to do so really just janitorial duties and acting as gorilla chew toys. Its not like theyre allowed to act as scientists or function as anything but test dummies in experiments. What do you want them to do sweep the streets in Diamond City? And in what way do they owe anything to the Wastelanders just by virtue of existing?Agree to disagree here. They are just tools nothing more than a mechanical extension of Institute technology. So yeah sweep the streets repair buildings deliver supplies all that good stuff. Should they be enslaved? Yeah probably not I think theyve shown their utility so they can have some say but Ill never give them the same rights as people. They arent people theyre machines.EDIT Additionally I realize I get a lot of downvotes for this position because it seems a bit racist which its not IMO because they arent a race. Theyre machines. but I dunno...I dont foresee having to deal with a problem like AI civil rights in my lifetime but it very well could be something as its slowly integrated itd slowly change my mind the more I see human traits exhibited by Synths like Curie with inspiration than biological ones need foodwatersleep. I grew up in the Deep South and growing before I knew anything about anything I was a hardcore homophobe. Thankfully I left and got a good education because after US v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges homophobia is patently and utterly ridiculous. But at my core I could never see them as human. Id always view them as advanced robots. I like robots I think theyre cool...but right now I cant imagine extending to robots the same rights humans share. By the people for the people. not for the machines. Its complicated and invokes a lot of thought processing for sure.gtFirst off Im pretty sure the freeing turrets thing was a joke. Secondly members of the group are allowed to have their own opinions. Just because Glory personally believes that gen s and s deserve freedom as well doesnt undermine the fact that the railroad is explicitly focused on freeing gen  synths. Maybe someday they could become an AI rights organization but in the context of the game the Railroad cohesively agrees that gen  synths deserve freedom and are dedicating their lives toward that goal.I dont really know if it was a joke. Deacon seemed pretty serious about it but then again this is Deacon were talking about. So you could be right. Having said that Id definitely like the RR more if they had some sort of cohesive mission purpose that as you said was dedicated to AI rights. If that was the case Id have chosen them at least once.Thats probably just bad Bethesda development.Thanks for the great post!,fo4,d1f8dwh,1,t5_2tzv4

I sat at the top of the building and just used sneak and pew pewd away with my mm till the Deathclaw came out then used the nondestructible car near the front of the museum to kite it back and forth. Luckily with the new damage model it actually dies faster than the old Survival mode. If I wasnt a power armorheavy weapons user I would actually run out of ammo vs the Deathclaw before.

7105143,0,t3_4cvhh4,Dont really have any complaints about the story.  The idea of the Mechanist being a misguided idealist isnt original but it did require a little thought.  You have the option to talk her down or kill her which was a nice change from some of the other quests.I thought the new raider faction was pretty well done from a flavor perspective.I thought the layout of the Mechanists base was actually pretty cool basically a hub and spoke model turned into a maze until you take the place out of lockdown.It would have been nice to have some deeper questions asked about the nature of AI.  A robobrain after all is basically a cyborg not an AI.  Also Adas concern for her companions and desire for revenge make me wonder why Curie felt the need to move into a synth body  how different are biochemically generated emotions vs. programmatic synthesized emotions in an AI?The flavor around the robobrains is just creepy.  I thought the processing facility was up there with Dunwich Borers and the Witch Museum for atmospheric ick factor.So given that the DLC was mostly to introduce the robot crafting mechanic I thought they put enough story originality and flavor in it to make it satisfying.

7118781,0,t1_d1naoc8,I think restricted saving is a good thought but youre right about the bed being an arbitrary choice. The other downside is that in order to save you actually have to sleep for  hour which carries the risk of catching a disease and also forces you to increase your thirst and hunger just to save your progress.I would be OK with an approach that would balance the challengestrategy aspects without being overly exploitable. For example the travel autosave would be easier to exploit by simply walking through any door which is usually easier to find than a bed. The wait autosave would be a bit harder to exploit and I dont think it would completely negate the challenge.But Id really like it if there were still the timed autosave but locked at a higher value than the default  min maybe m or so. That way you would at least have somewhat of a fallback point in the inevitable event that the game freezes or crashes through no fault of your own.The punishment of having to redo something over and over that forces you to plan ahead is definitely a part of the game mode but in my experience so far its crossed the line from challenging to tedious and at times its just plain obnoxious.,fo4,d1nbh56,5,t5_2tzv4

7237203,0,t1_d208ado,Since you were so nice about it I gave it a try myself. Unlike other wallfloor combos the concrete walls can snap to either the outside edge or top edge of the floors. This will leave a small indent at building corners. If you use rounded floor pieces the rounded wall pieces can only snap to the outside of the floor piece but provide for a seamless inside and outside wall seamless meaning no weird indent gaps at the corners. Plus it looks really neat. There is an upper floor piece which is x as tall as the other floor pieces and snaps to the walls halfway through its thickness. The walls can snap stacked on each other so that there is no gap but again only possible if you are doing your floorwall snapping on the outside edge of the floor.If you use the rounded floor pieces and the small floor piece in between the rounded bits then youll need to stack  of each on top of each other so that the ceiling and floor are flush with the upper floor piece since they are only x thick each.TLDR  in the picture youre snapping the floor to the walls on the wall top edge.

7276439,0,t3_4f1shx,Best way to grind without exploits is to  repeat radiant quests over and over. BOSs at Campbridge is great because you can do  quests at once and Preston is good because him plus the radio freedom can give you up to  at once.  while doing the quests kill loot and scavenge EVERYTHING. Every kill gets you xp and harder enemies give you a pretty penny.  with your new found resources about every  quest cycles go to your settlements and just build crap. Whatever you want go wild. Anything you looted that you cant turn to scrap or its not worth it to sell to buy shipments. When I used to do this I could guarantee a level in about an hour I was around level  just by doing the quests getting home and cooking all my meats and making a lot of chems. Protip If you intelligence sucks look especially close for legendary armor marked Sharp.

The only way to get up to the ship is by verti signal nades or airport one.Siding with the institute allows you to teleport to the Institute HQ from any location on the map. However when exiting you are put above the CIT Ruins.Minutemen and Railroad get no such bonuses. This is one of the reasons settlements are a lot more important here.

7306924,0,t1_d2733o0,People misunderstood me I dont think fallout  as a whole is bad game  its actually pretty fine by itself but its  bad fallout game but even then there are things that I do really like about it like for example I LOVE how power armor works in this fallout game it works much better then in previous fallout games I felt like a GOD when jumped from building down  but I think we got it far too soon especially since because of how Bethesda wanted to limit it usage they created HUGE plot hole in the story fusion cores of power armors in lore are said to be able to function for  years yet in game they only last for  minutes I could understand that the ones in generators could be mostly depletedeven though they are some problems like the fact why fusion cores in all generators have exactly same amount of energy but some of fusion cores we find are in places that hint they werent used before.Bethesda wouldnt create this problem if they only didnt give power armor so soon in game which wouldnt force them to limit its usage.Another thing that I like is how we can mod weapons and armors true to be told I actually expected something more from this in fallout  but its good enough for me to enjoy it. What I was actually expectinghoping for was ability to CREATE our own weapons by mixing parts freely like for example mix revolver cylinder and long barrel to create something like revolver shotgunthere is something like that in real life or maybe create revolver sniper rifle so even though it wasnt what I expected it was still good enough to enjoy it there is only one real problem with fallout  weapon modding which is inability to dismantle gun into its parts  its extremly stupid that I have to create weaker version of component and put it into gun from which I want to take superior version of component just so I can put superior version into my prefered gun.I do normally like action RPGs and previous Bethesda style fallout games were good mix of both action and RPGs but sadly fallout  to me is much more action then RPG it has much more limited ways to interaction with the worldpeople and things in it then previous fallout gameseven fallout .Improvements to action part of game is very good idea but not at cost of rpg side of gameI am someone who likes both action and rpg games so this game should be for me but it isnt since while improvements to action part of game are good they arent good enough to make fallout  great  action gameI played a lot of much better action games some of them for free and rpg side is too weak now for fallout  to be considred unique actionrpg experiance like previous Bethesdastyle fallout games where.,fo4,d28qxaq,2,t5_2tzv4

7366912,0,t1_d2fd6il,I think a little could depend on how far back they had planned the Far Harbor DLC. I read in one interview wish I could find it and link it where Todd Howard said the DLCs added would be based on what chatter they hear from the gaming community as they play the base game.  If true then like uanrii s previous post said the game world would be altered in order to add in a transfer point to FH. However if like they did in FONV or FO already appear to have an idea of what the DLC would be then they would have preplanned sites and transfer locations ready to go and essentially just splice them in when the DLC drops.   I think the truth probably falls somewhere in the middle IMO. Beth probably had some ideas planned but waiting to do the final rewrites until after they got a better sense of what the gaming community was enjoying about the game thus the additions of more settlement building options in the first two DLCs. I figured the post Far Harbor DLCs will probably be more truer or purer to Howards statement since they were not originally planned for when the season pass was  originally announced last year. ,fo4,d2fkf8l,3,t5_2tzv4

You might have already figured that out too.

If you experience the issue where theres a big bar across your screen then it probably means you have to reinstall DEFUI from scratch. There are still issues and conflicts  DEFUI gives a lot of LOOK UP FAILED responses. Although that could be because of another mod I doubt it.If you have mods that affect sorting or the PIPBOY then that might be the issue too. Play with the load order to figure it out.

Everyone does that. I could add rules like no chems and alcohol no mines no hud etc just to make these challenges difficult but the purpose of this was to show that the no healing aspect in the challenge is completely possible. Ive seen people mention about this in comment sections saying that no healing in Fallout  is impossible because of how enemies can overwhelm you quick and the amount of radiation available in the game.

After breaking my legs  or  times and having to eat  mutt chops i reached the area before the bridge. Walking really slowly i see a group of  scavengers coming right at me telling me not to come close. I shit my pants trying to get of the road sneaking so they wouldnt get aggro on me. Knowing that if i stayed to close these guys they would shoot my face of without any remorse of all the effort the transport tookAfter that it was all fine got to hangmans alley dropped my stuff in the workbench and had a nice pint.,fo4,d2xc87x,3,t5_2tzv4

Grow up take responsibility for your health and stop expecting things to be made for a small minority of players. If it effects less than  of players than its unneeded and a waste of Bethesda time.

When I finally got into town it was dark and the doctor had closed up shop. I thought about sleeping at the Dugout but with the infection getting worse I mightve just woken up dead. So I spent the night wandering around Diamond City with an infected dog bite nursing it with water and cups of noodles I carried with me from my noodle factory at the drivein extra noodles to feed my parasites.

I played melee straight up. I started out with radroaches and boatflies. I moved on to Mongrels and RadstagsBrahmins. I killed Raiders in Concord and a lot of Raiders camping around Lexington and the Sanctuary Hills area for example in the forests. I am really enjoying this playthrough. I was able to get  settlements inside of the LexingtonConcordSantuary Hills area or Zone . I hope people dont give up because survival mode is so awesome to play in.

Its a waste of time. I also like having a home base I can use and go back to at the end of the day. Also I use console commands a lot for building settlements tcl and tgm are godsends.

I think it was supposed to be exclusive to outfits that you cant wear armor over if not to match the missing DR from armor then at least to help make up for it but its just all over the damn place. Theres more outfits that you cant wear armor over that take ballistic weave than there are clothing that you can use armor with that takes it both numerically and proportionally. And if the outfits and clothing somehow arent a mistake then the hats definitely are because the few that take ballistic weave get the same DR as as any other item that can take it.

After crossing a road you will encounter some Bloatflys then just south of that is a small shack with two Raiders in it. South of the shack is a Gunner encampment on an overpass. circle East or West around it and keep heading south toward Grey Garden. Once at Grey Garden keep heading south across the river towards Vault .Once at Vault  head towards the tunnel and then head East on the outside of the tunnel area then head south at the buildings. You will pass by Hardware Town but keep heading East and a little north until you see a small gap in the buildings.

What the build bar glitch drop an item go to workshop menu store into workshop inventory rinse amp repeat does is that it makes the game think you are removing existing objects within your settlement and thus it reduces the build bar giving you more room to add stuff. The problem with this is if you later then reach the old build limit you have no way of knowing it and going way past the limit usually causes long loading screens fps drops and jitters when you travel to  are at your settlement.But as Albertstreet said the glitch is very helpful for people on console looking to have fun building settlements without having to constantly scavengebuy resources.

7714335,0,t1_d3is129,BoS are a far more interesting faction in Fo than Fo but I end up disliking them so much. Theyre essentially very hypocritical. They preach about how no one can be trusted with technology other than them and yet they hoard and utilise that same technology for themselves. Thats how they should be in Fallout though I think. You are meant to begin by thinking they are whiteknights and then slowly realize they are only selfinterested and very narrow minded...A world where they completely seized all power would be a dictatorship. Sure it would be decent to live in if you are a normal human standing in line but if youre a ghoul a nonhostile sentient synth or a super mutant that has held onto its humanity your screwed. Theyre like crusaders in that they abide by a certain religion of sorts as they purge the land and there is no wiggleroom within their doctrines.At first it irritated me that they had such a headstrong almost arrogant view of their mission. As their story in Fo unfolds I actually find parts of the Brotherhood more palatable. I love the quests involving Danse being a synth his struggle to accept and adjust to this and the fact that Maxon decides to let him live. To me that shows that they arent completely rigid that they do have some humanity and ability to think outside of their rules and tenets.Its a shame that there arent really many other ways that they do this. You hear Scribe Halen question the Brotherhoods methods but unfortunately when you cross their faction she just hurrdurr fights you and dies.I ultimately decided that the Railroad would be my faction in the first playthrough. I find them poorly executed but still preferably. Minutemen seem boring but I may try them and they seem intended as canonical. Its a shame that when you cross the Brotherhood as the Railroad literally none of them even stop to consider diplomacy or jump ship. Even a quest with one or two of them such as Halen listening to reason wouldve gone a long way towards humanizing them.As for the Institute what a mess of a faction I still dont understand exactly what they are trying to achieve by replacing people with synths over and over or much else of what they do. They just seem a bit moronic and are certainly the least appealing option.All things said and done I do love when the Brotherhood are hostile and you wander around finding huge skirmishes with Paladins in power armor and Raiders etc. I still havent seen what this looks like when all the robots and Rust Devils get involved in Automatron!,fo4,d3j2fbo,3,t5_2tzv4

You do get more rad resistance through perks though but not alot to be considered immune. To become in essence immune i would have to think you would need  resistance to not take any damage in high radiation areas. Even then that might not be enough as some areas of the glowing sea still give you rad damage with  rad resistance. I have all the rad protection perks and even with combat armor in BOS form that grants  resistance per piece a robot that gives off rediculous radiation when it explodes can be upwards of  or more radiation damage that shows up if im in the blast radius. That damage i would have to assume is after my resistance is taken into account and would be a higher number if my resistance is lower. ,fo4,d3ke7p1,2,t5_2tzv4

Same thing with Microsoft. However from what I heard in the past Sonys certification usually takes longer. Which is why you see stuff popping up on Xbox before PS. If Bethesda submitted the patch last week its completely out of their hands and when it will be released is up to Sony which could be anywhere from now to next week. Assuming they dont reject the patch that is. If that happens Bethesda needs to submit a different version and the process starts all over. ,fo4,d3qxlvb,16,t5_2tzv4

7809044,0,t1_d3trun6,Offically I cant say but Id wager the Brotherhood of Steel see themselves as the true inheritors of the traditions and purpose of the U. S. Army.  They consider the Enclave traitors.  Where most of the military of the day would line up is something you could debate forever but I think most would end up in the Brotherhood not the Enclave camp.  Shadow governments and their enforcers are seldom popular.  Were I to walk in on the government doing what they were doing at Mariposa I only hope Id have the integrity to do what Maxson and company did.Not all authority is official.  The Pope only has sovereignty over the Vatican but Im sure a lot of Catholics feel that he has authority of some kind beyond that.  Several U.N. organizations possess authority of a kind.

Using mines is a great suggestion also.Do you have Refreshing beverages? They heal quickly even on Survival mode and have a reasonable duration. Drink one as soon as she breeches the wall so its working before the fight begins. Spam another one as needed.Try using other foods like Yao Gui ribs Bloodbug steak etc. to raise your health and damage resistance. There are foods from the Far Harbor DLC that protect the user from poison damage but it sounds like you havent been up there yet.Put your companion in Power Armor. Theyll last longer. Give them the best automatic weapon you can spare and as much ammo for it as you can spare. Also give them any Molotovs you have as long as you keep your distance.If you continue having difficulty with the poison you might try to farm for Poisoners legendary armor. Good luck!

Fallout  was more fun personally as I didnt have to worry about frame rate getting unplayable or enemies constantly falling through the floor!New Vegas has some great mechanics and ideas but  its weird how its all of a sudden the best of the series. It was nowhere near as popular after launch! This coming from someone who bought all games except the original at launch.That said I love them all and if you find you really like  you probably will too. Just dont pay too much mind to the New Vegas hype or you might be disappointed.But with regard to your question my only advice would be to take your time dont worry too much about rushing through the main quest and focus more on exploration. Try to keep fast travelling to a minimum as youll discover more that way. Oh and dont go charging into a fight when you are quite low level as certain enemy types can swarm you pretty quick!Best tip I can give though is do what you want! Thats the best thing about these games you can play as you like. Be a snipergrab a baseball bat and start swingingavoid combat and sneak around in the shadows rebuild the commonwealth or hell just Stay in Sanctuary for the rest of your days! Find what you like the most and pick perks that fit your play style. Have fun!!,fo4,d44r6fy,1,t5_2tzv4

Operation Anchorage Literally just a linear shooter with loot at the end Mothership Zeta Again a linear shooter with loot at the end and some lore. Point Lookout An actual world space but not much in the way of side quests The Pitt Another new world space but not many side quests and not a lot of content Broken Steel A few new quests and itemsMeanwhile Automatron adds not only a quest but an entirely new crafting system. And Far Harbor is the largest Bethesda expansion to date with hours of content.

7940895,0,t1_d48k6lp,I think that theres a vault located somewhere in the Commonwealth that we didnt initially get to discover but an old radio broadcast is going to take us there. The vault is going to be newly opened with citizens who are completely oblivious to the world outside and in need of a guiding hand you to get them acclimated. You can either keep the current citizens or dispose of them a la Covenant and you can do whatever youd like with the vault. You could open it up like  or keep it closed and do your own experiments on the citizens. Hopefully the settlers will be revamped to where they need certain things like entertainment relaxation etc. to stay happy and healthy.The actual building part is probably where the story kind of breaks from lore because thered be no feasible way you could build a vault using VaultTec assets postwar. I think Bethesdas shuffling that away along with the other game mechanics since for example the SS probably cant build an entire metropolis by themselves in a matter of days and fill it with people.

I deleted a bunch of mods after a reinstall and I think uninstalling snap n build did it. . If snap n build was the cause they have  a patch in the files on nexusmods. . If that wasnt it there is a mod that restores menus through the crafting menu at the chemistry station.. if those dont work try this Mods.bethesda.netenworkshopfalloutmoddetail. Something to consider I think I had a couple different mod files countering one another as I tried to troubleshoot. You will have to loadsavereload several time but be patient and dont give up on your current save file unless it is unimportant. If that is the case early saves will have it..

All the faults in the gaming industry and the biggest one is uWheezined because he likes Fallout that shill. gt youre lying to yourselfOh someone who didnt just go along with my cookie cutter opinion that I filched off of rgaming? He actually likes the game? No Im objectively correct hes just lying to himself. ITT only reel feelz about Fallout no shillsgt Constructive criticism is something that developers needI agree entirely. Now go back and read my first comment. I said the systems werent as bad as many made them out to be not that they werent deserving of criticism. I even said I preferred the older dialogue model. You then responded by attempting to belittle me by saying have you even played FNV? as if to say youre le true Fallout fan and your opinion is more valid without actually knowing anything about me. gt But it isnt nearly as deep as the previous entries into the seriesSee this is the bullshit. Ive logged a fuckton of hours on  and NV and it felt like the same damn thing and the main quest was actually much better than NV imo. In New Vegas its a simple land dispute between factions and its not even a difficult choice. The Legion are comic book villains with no redeeming qualities the NCR are decent but corrupt and then theres the option of self control with Mr. House and betrayal aka a power grab on your part. Its so simple that theres really no gray area for any decision you make. The Institute Brotherhood and Railroad all hinge upon your belief of whether or not a synth is alive and deserving of rights. Theres gray area to each faction and even moral ambiguity and questions about siding with each of them. The not as deep stuff is just parroted and people give NV a pass for being shallow as fuck when they grill  for the slightest thing. gt Oh and about the game being less of an RPG and being a good game but not what I wanted or expected from a game Ive been waiting  years for?Congrats you waited like everyone else including me. I cant actually tell what youre trying to say here because its not a complete thought. You said oh and about but never qualified that you just ended a description of the games relation to your opinion with a question mark. So what about it? gt Just because someones opinion doesnt fall in line with your own doesnt invalidate it. Youre being a child.Did you think of that before or after you told me gt youre lying to yourselffor having a different opinion? I think you have a valid opinion because I cant say it doesnt count its just so played out that its easy to tell when people buy into the circlejerk. You couldnt even get one critical thought of the game down without talking about le witchur  or FNV and theres so much circlejerk buzz language. When I said it was from parroting other opinions your response was well its my opinion! Again right but if you had put more thought into it you wouldnt have fallen so lockstep in with that circlejerk that your opinions are so predictable. gt Youre being a child.What he said my opinion is unoriginal?

In hindsight it might just have been that I put sloped pieces leading up to it.

The Shem Drowne sword looks the same as the Revolutionary Sword but has a neat effect so Ill give that half credit. So this narrows down to about eleven and a half unique weapons.Now I took a looksee at New Vegas. Unless I miscounted there were  unique weapons with most having a new appearance as well as effects you could not replicate with the base weapon.So I can fully  percent understand why people say there are not enough unique weapons.,fo4,d4ku7hh,2,t5_2tzv4

Instead of making interesting world and quests like in New Vegas or Oblivion they made Sims and shrinked the map so every  steps you discover new city.

Either he was made to look like someone related to the player or he really is Shaun.My best guess on the identity of the old man Kellogg is referring to is Dr. Walker the head of the cybernetics division who we never see in the game but is mentioned in a few terminals and holotapes.One place wheres hes mentioned is the memory that was cut from the Memory Den sequence although the dialogue was recycled as a holotape in the Institute. The memory shows Kellogg getting his final cybernetic implants as a reward for kidnapping Shaun see  in the sources link below for the full text. The scientist installing the cybernetics tells Kellogg that Doctor Walker was very pleased.Dr. Walker is also mentioned in Fathers terminal at the end of the game. He isnt mentioned as being anything like the head of the Institute but Father mentions that he shut down Walkers cybernetics project because he believed it was the wrong direction for preserving humanity see . Walkers extended lifespan could be explained by his cybernetic research.Sources I happened to create this for a different post P,fo4,d52g2yz,2,t5_2tzv4

8226381,0,t1_d55j4i2,Actually they mentioned that settlements were a relatively last minute thing and were high on the chopping block if other things were falling behind. Given that odds are it didnt really impact the creation of big cities. What is more likely IMO of course is that Bethesda overdid the philosophy of dont make things too big and wanted to emphasize reduced loading screens.Sometimes games have cities too large and empty and thus many players complain and say things like I wish everything was in one central area for convenience. Look at DT you have the market crafting stations and even a player home right in one spot.Of course then you have the other problem of what youre saying where theres not much to a city at all.Neither opinion is wrong it just means finding the right balance between the two extremes is difficult. Finally they were really proud of how many loading screens they didnt need anymore and thus that mightve had more sway than necessary.  ,fo4,d55ur3k,1,t5_2tzv4

Maybe the mod doesnt work well with the latest version of the patch which means you will need to remove the mod and wait for an update either from Beth. or the author of the mod.Also how are you power settings? Please note that due to an MS error with their powerplay system if you remove your Power Cable and put it back in the Laptop will keep using the energy saving settings you will need to flip through all the option such as Performance Balanced etc both with and without your power plugged to fix the issue.Lastly check your drivers and makes sure they assigned Performance to the games file especially if you have Optimus enabled for integrated card.

8257743,0,t1_d59rher,Ha! One of the reasons I ended up with this odd scenario is that Fallout games trigger my innerhoarder to the max and leads to me picking up every.thing. Strong Back perk was maxed pretty quickly and Id take three trips to complete a mission if thats what it took to clear a place of every last scrap weapon and piece of armor. Over time I kind of developed a system of what weaponsarmor to sell and which to breakdown or equip on settlers. Thats probably  percent of it and the rest comes from settlement income. Every vanilla settlement has  settlers and  shops so it just adds up.One of my favorite things is going to a settlement after not being there for some time and collecting a big chunk of caps.,fo4,d59rwjk,1,t5_2tzv4

8265566,0,t3_4skdn2,Are you going to be a survivalist living off the wasteland or are you going to be a community organizer? That is the biggest question for starting a new build IMHO.            Here are a few suggestions              Get medic or solar powered and ghoulish. Both will keep you alive in slightly different ways with different pros and cons.            Get scrounger for any low charisma build. Ammo is expensive to buy. With scrounger though you can stay supplied in the field iff you have a few guns with different ammo types. With some charisma you can buy the best guns and ammo and carry less guns but more ammo.              Are you traveling around a lot? The more points in Endurance and agility you have the faster you can get around. Or you can rush to kill you know who and get a vertibird. Or you can swim to a lot of places pretty quickly. Keep in mind how you  will traverse the wastes.                    Mines and traps can be a bitch in survival. The difference between seeing a minefield as a treacherous place or a gold mine depends on your perk selection.               Loot weight is a precious commodity. Are you going to horde it all or just bring back the best and priciest pieces? Make sure your perks allow your choice.               Charisma and Intelligence I tend to treat as all or nothing perks. Intelligence has some good stuff in it. Once you start down that road you end up getting them all. Charisma helps a lot with settlements and trading. If you are going to be Barry the Community Organizer then invest heavily in that tree. If you live off the field then why waste the perks? Dont need it. Also Charisma has some great perks to load up on. If youre going to do it go full monty.                  Pick just one weapon based perk to start with. It doesnt matter wich. They are all viable even commando if you have a way to procure enough ammo.                          So want an idea on a build? How about a washed out athlete that got a scholarship but got into drugs and then the baby came and then the bombs fell. Perhaps a distance runner with high agility and endurance. Moderate intelligence and not a scrap of luck or charisma. After all have you ever met a lucky and charming jet head? Me neither but I know some that can scrap anything.     Build up sneak moving target chemist till level                Build up strength and perception plus add another sneak level till lev              Add in locksmith and ninja. More in pickpocket and sneak.            Adding strong bach and keeping sneak and gunslinger as high as possible until lev                Keeping everything maxed till             Maxing out chemist ghoulish gunslinger strong back            First  levels you are a sneaky opportunist. Get the easy to steal items and leave. Dont fight more than one or two enemies at a time. Be willing to do a lot of in and out raids of locations for easy loot.           Next  levels or so you are going to be able to do some damage but need to stay stealth as much as possible. Remember to leave enough AP to sprint from the fight.         Next ten levels or you are going to be sneaky enough to really scout out the area and perhaps pickpocket some equiped items. You should have some chems though so once spotted blast your way through them. You have a lot of VATS as well. More dead enemies means more loot and that increased carry weight will help. If you are really into VATS you might want to trade a few perks for Gunfu now.         By level  you should be a gunslinging killing machine. After pickpocketing a power core and some other equipped items planting a couple mines and stealth killing a few you should have no problem mopping up the remnants loud and proud.,fo4,d5ar4rs,1,t5_2tzv4

Like if youre in Sanctuary Finch Farm isnt loaded in the engine at all so the engine cant generate the correct resource values to display in the pipboy. Then when you go to Finch Farm and the cell is loaded the correct numbers will show up in the pipboy.I agree its shitty and super annoying but I guess the explanation sort of makes sense.,fo4,d5gww3v,2,t5_2tzv4

8393138,0,t1_d5qojhz,I thought the same thing about DiMA. Id sick my Institute on him but theyll probably just blanket the whole of Acadia and Id like to see them have the life they choose for themselves. And then there is Kasumi I feel empathetic for her she walked straight into the middle of a clusterfuck. In a way my decisions in the game are similar in nature to DiMA I sided with The Institute because they stand the best chance for a better Boston and because with my help I could guide them to be more ethical and stop treating people like lab rats. A bunker full of bored scientists and nobody around them to question their ethics so I step in to change that. Unfortunately The Institute will never be in peace with The Railroad or The Brotherhood of Steel... I tried to be peaceful with them but there was no gameplay option my hand was forced to continue the game.Maybe Im a hypocrite too.,fo4,d5qotx0,1,t5_2tzv4

Does it greatly alter the universe that the world is set in?Think about it telling us ghouls can live under these extreme circumstances greatly alters everything about ghouls in the universe. In the same way a person walking away from a car crash perfectly unscathed would ruin that character as it removes the risks for that character. Suddenly ghouls literally only need to not be stabbed and they can live until they go feral. They can even live on minimal oxygen old fridges tend to have a seal that makes air transfer very minimal there used to be plenty of stories of kids hiding in old ones during hide and seek and suffocating because theyd be locked in well basically the reverse of this quest. and yes I have watched a couple episodes of the librarians cant seem to find it on anymore. was pretty interesting,fo4,d5r03jg,1,t5_2tzv4

The Far Harbor DLC is a rip off of a New Vegas mod. There was already a build your own vaults mod etc etc. Nuka World will probably be a rip off of some other quest mods.I mean they arent terrible but like Fo itself its like they were a little lazy this time around...Not lazy but...unfocused? Like they werent focuses on building up anything. Like a ton of devs they got it intot heir heads for some reason that we gotta tell this story. the story you guys.t hats what people want. No. We want a world that we can make characters live in. We dont want to look for our son. We want to make our own goals. We dont need workshop DLC mods can take care of that in a vastly superior way.Im starting to see a pattern. But maybe now that Todd Howard admitted some things werent well received we can hope they arent do this crap with TES.

Youve got  END youre rocking Ballistic Weave MkV on both clothes and hat youre wearing full Assault Marine Armor and you decide youre just gonna charge into a group of Raiders because theyre not a threat. Until the Super Mutants hear the fight and a Suicider decides to use you as an end zone. You just lost an hour of progress and its entirely your fault.Your companions constantly remind you in downtown Boston to be observant and the game itself flat out tells you that you shouldnt expect to survive multiple hits from enemies. You know from every other time this has happened that youre not a God of the Wasteland and youre not above consequences for bad decisions. But youll keep doing it as I keep doing it as most of us who play on Survival keep doing it.

8509807,0,t3_4wa5gd,No? Yes? There is SOME overlap with mainly static objects by example Homemaker which adds nearly everything thats not nailed down and lots of things that are as placeable objects and some of them were later on added by the official DLC like the vaulttec boxes some walls and such. But if you wait for a mod that redoes say the logic gates or the manufacturing or whatnot no. Very very likely well have fixes and expansions to them of course but no mod will be a full replacement without also needing the original DLC. Far Harbor doesnt add that much new building stuff so you can ignore it though of course theres a ton of story to it. VaultTec on the other hand DOES add a lot of stuff.

8717836,0,t1_d6usrna,i have no real clue what youre talking about in your first point so im going to assume that you mean that you create your own story thorough all the random things that can happen to while on your journey. cool i like that but are you implying that its something never been done before in a fallout game? hell thats what the random encounter system was ALL about in fallout  and  again though thats my assumption about what youre talking about feel free to correct me if im wrong. yes taking away skills is silly there was nothing wrong with the skills system in previous games. why do you think GURPS and by extention SPECIAL and skills was so successful. look up specific builds online what? unless youre experimenting with someone elses builds i see absoluetely no reason why you would NEED to do this just put a little more thought into what kind of character you want. also if you waste skill points on something and it comes back to bite you in the ass thats YOUR fault. there is absolutely nothing wrong with having consequences for foolishly wasting skill points away. which is why i hate the new perk system. if you mess up so what? just wait till the next level theres absolutely no risk of failure and in turn no real reward either. i will agree that streamlining isnt always bad for example no mans sky has multiple menus to build one thing and thats not necessary at all. There are plenty of justified criticisms but the elitists who say its not an RPG are probably the same people who skip all dialogue fast travel everywhere and plow through everything as fast as possible. Which is not IMO when this game is at its best. is this a joke? almost any RPG fan would take the time to explore and find out what things are hidden in the game its one of the main pulls of the genre. im not sure if you were just trying to bait people with that statement but lets take Fallout  for example. it has junktown which is completely optional but it has two fully voiced characters a questline you just stumble into and the town even has its own ending slide depending on how you complete the quest and im sure most people would agree that its something not to skip on so i have no idea where you pulled your last statement from.,fo4,d6vdaeb,2,t5_2tzv4

8730621,0,t3_4zlyng,I started a new character for survival mode. It wasnt pretty. I ended up using most of my upgraded perks for general survival skills. I upgraded sneak local leader etc long before I started on my weapon and armor perks. I learned that running is the best defense. Scouring the land for beds is also a thing you absolutely have to do. It wasnt until around level  that my instinct to quick save stopped. That reflex was replaced by intense focus and attention to what was going on around me. The more time I was away from a save the more cautious I got.Something that helped me manage my constant dying and needing to redo long missions was accepting that I wasnt playing survival because I wanted to zip through all the missions and finish the game. The reason I play survival is because I love playing the game. So if I died  times on really long missions Far Harbor  cough cough  I wasnt really upset. Whether I was playing the same mission  times or playing  missions  time I was still playing the game. ,fo4,d6wz13s,3,t5_2tzv4

As for the Deathclaw I stayed on the roof with the PA and minigun and sniped things until it spawned  I then let the raiders poke at it for a bit before I jumped down and went to it.   Then it was let Dogmeat be abused long enough to drop two Moltovs on it and proceed to unload on it with the minigun while backing up using the cars and barriers along the road back to the museum to slow it down. ,fo4,d6wz5il,2,t5_2tzv4

8803339,0,t3_50ng0a,This may be related to the glitch where you cant trade or talk to a companion. The cause is that you exited an interaction middialouge at some point with another companion or essential character. If this is the same glitch youll need to retrace your steps a little and go interact with all your companions to see if they are the ones you bailed on. If that doesnt work youll need to try and remember if you exited an interaction too early with one of the characters on a quest or something. It took me a good month to finally track this back to one of the vaults where I had started to follow a character to the next step of a quest and then left them to do something else. Once I picked back up with them completed the task everything worked again. To check if this is the issue you can load an old save and see if you are able to interact properly. If so I bet you are suffering from the same glitch. Hope my ramblings make sense!,fo4,d761im1,1,t5_2tzv4

8870958,0,t3_51rc90,In my current campaign playthrough my character is a neutralgood aligned doorkicker class. He prefers battle rifles for medium range combat and submachine pistols for close range. He tries to do the right thing bust finding his son is his top priority. He has allied with the minutemen and the BoS because their resources can go a long way towards his goal. After attempting to help a man save his family and falling into a brutal trap he was crowned leader of a group of raiders. He can hardly stand this group of chaotic evil jackasses but he knows in his current state he would be unable to take over nukaworld with the minutemen. His plan is to place the most rational group of raiders in charge by sowing distrust between them and the other groups. If they survive perhaps they can learn to reason with them and if not they will be weak enough for the minutemen to wipe out.,fo4,d7e5x5y,2,t5_2tzv4

Ive been using mods for a while so it isnt as big a deal to me I guess. But I can absolutely understand not giving refunds. The game has been out for almost a year and the implication of console mods was to try something and was not intended to be a major feature of the game itself.

8904666,0,t1_d7i6pi4,No. My long winded statement is just to make a point regarding the ever popular post of just build a pc.  There are many reasons why people buy consoles as opposed to PCs but I feel it can be compared to same reasons people buy pizzas at the store rather than make them at home. In both cases its a matter of what seems more convenient and less stress.   I can understand why you might think I was drunk or high but thought maybe paralleling it to something else might help more easily illustrate why as simple as you felt your suggest was why it might not be the best solution to a lot of people just like a lot of people would not bother to make their own pizza dough and sauce from scratch like I always do because it really is simpler than you think even more than building a PC.    I would like to add that I also disagree with the down votes your comment got.

8966434,0,t3_531zt1,The saving only when you sleep aspect of survival mode is for masochists imo. I dont know how people can play that way. Its x worse than dying in Dark Souls because of how long it can be since the last time you slept. If anything it makes the game far less interesting to me since it drastically influences your playstyle to only play a certain way. Even if you could stomach the death aspect the shittiness of the engine and all the bugs means youll probably get fucked over by a glitch of some kind. Also since it disables the console it prevents you from getting yourself out of some glitched situations. Personally I want the other survival aspects but hate the save mechanics so I installed this mod for my own sanity. I also later in the game installed a mod that allowed fast travel because it was getting real tedious running everywhere.,fo4,d7pmp5o,2,t5_2tzv4

Ill make myself a better Gatling Laser. With blackjack and hookers.Edit I just read a thing that said for Aeternus to work properly you need at least TWO fusion cores in your inventory.I tried that and it spun up and fired... TWO shots then stopped. There was then one core left in my inventory. I switched away from Aeternus and back to it and now it spun up and fired one shot again then stopped and I now had no cores left.I suppose this is my punishment for winning each of the arena fights in about . seconds with The Problem Solver.Edit  You can or at least I could unfuck Aeternus by dropping it and picking it up but Im not sure of the exact sequence of actions you need to take. I think I made it work by dropping it when I had no cores getting several cores out of a container then picking the gun up again. It never seems to work if I only have a couple of cores but... screw it Im done fiddling with this stupid heavy thing thats little use to me in Survival anyway.

9134601,0,t1_d89tet3,Its something people hardly ever wanna hear but you might wanna reroll your character. Luckily your only lvl  so its not a big deal. Charisma and intelligence are good as you were told but you hardly ever wanna start with  in anything and even less so in two things in your case bc then all your offensive stats are  at max unless you invest in them.   A couple points in strength for carry weight  Some points in perception really useful if you use VATS a lot  Maybe a point or two in endurance you can totally make it on like  END  Charisma doesnt really need to be higher than  though you can start with it lower  maybe? and raise it later.   For intelligence youll probably want at least  for Gun Nut and   Agility is also very important I think its one of the most and   A lot of the later Luck stuff can make you very powerful.Of course it all comes down to preference and how you want to play sneaky sniper run and gun w shotgun pistol packin wanderer etc. will change how you might want to best spec your character. For example having a higher intelligence isnt necessary for energy weapons but the perk science! is very useful for energy weapon users.

9183573,0,t3_563q1d,Yeah its beneficial to build up the settlements before turning them into a supply depot.But mostly the reason the raiders are starving they say is because the outpost they are at likely doesnt make its own sufficient food. If you have Automatron build up a farm and have the robots do the farming. Raiders can and will farm but they just dont like to and it will bring down happiness a bit. So if you dont have Automatron then assign raiders to farm and add extra happiness stuff to counter the unhappiness of making them actually work. This will stop the bitching. Just make sure its sufficient to how many raiders are there. Ex raiders need  food.Edit Its stupid I know.

9229904,0,t1_d8lmsxu, Dont call people names. Rule . The rest is addressing points by you and uawfulwebsite. Fallouts SCIENCE! makes most of both your points moot.  Being sterilised by FEV doesnt make muties any less alive than somebody who was castrated. Mutants cannot reproduce. Their sole method of creating more mutants is infecting others with more FEV. Radiation sickness is in fact caused by an illness. Diseases do not have to be either fatal or pathogeninduced to be diseases which is the technical term for any illness. Ever met somebody with arthritis ? Heart disease? A stroke? None of those are strictly fatal and none are caused by pathogens. Ghouls are a subrace but its unknown whether they are a truly distinct race. Depends whether the born ghouls can have babies with normal humans.  Radiation exposure is most certainly not a form of descent but it could be a way for a splinter race to spawn. However that doesnt apply here since each nonbornghoul needs to become a ghoul by radiation exposure. That would be like saying amputation is a form of descent. Dunking humans in FEV is not a biological method of reproduction and conflicts with your own point. Mutants cannot create more mutants without the influence of a finite external agent so it is not a sustainable inherent reproductive process.,fo4,d8lyhuz,1,t5_2tzv4

Your talking about sleeping in Libertalia its a raiders nest and even with the place cleared there could be raiders who were gone scaving whod return and kill you in your sleep or worst enslave you. You could always go to Nordhagen Beech to take a nap. That place is defensible if you see a bed that just cant be used what I do is imagine all love stains they have encrused in them or maybe they are just totaly out of commision and nothing but rust and tatters. Some of the mattreses could have had people die on them and so theyd be putrid sleeping on a bad bed gets you various maladies in survival mode because when your sleeping in a dirty bed its already inhygenic enough that you can get parasites or an infection those that are unusable must be like the most terrible beds ever. But yah there are mods that allow sleeping bags but bethesda went and decided to be asshats and restric trophies to non moded saves only which is acrually stupid as hell because it just means that Ill mod my save to give me each trophy dont ever tell me how to play games again Beth.,fo4,d8ndrm8,3,t5_2tzv4

Their reaction to this whole fuckfest makes their stance clear they think that allowing fullyfledged mods onto their system is too risky and are willing to sacrifice the sales of a thirdparty game to prevent it.What were seeing now is Bethesda attempting to hastily salvage preorders and projected sales I sincerely doubt that PS mods will ever have the limitations lifted.,fo4,d8s7qa3,1,t5_2tzv4

9304684,0,t1_d8us8ed,Buy it from Alexis Combes the shopkeeper in Vault  located just west of DC on the other side of the reservoir. Its a tricky approach very early in the game. On the south side of the reservoir are some stingwings that will take you out quickly. To the north side among the houses theres almost always raiders or some such fighting. On the hill above the Vault is a yao guai. Your best two approaches are to slip between the building west of DC and hit the reservoir on the east side and carefully sneak along the northernmost edge. If youre spotted run like hell for the vault. Alternatively going north of the road north of the houses  on the river side is pretty safe. Head west until you see the hillcliff and then move south along its face. Follow that around until the fence where Vault  is. At this point in the game you have no ability to fight anything you meet on survival. You want to avoid everything or run from it. ,fo4,d8vfpcs,1,t5_2tzv4

You will lose control of whatever settlements you use to supply your Raiders meaning you cant use their workshop anymore.  Personally Im setting out to use Murkwater Construction Site as my vassal since its a pretty crap settlement the only positive is all the water farming.Preston will indeed hate you so its recommended that you max out his relationship beforehand if you want his perk.,fo4,d9bi9me,1,t5_2tzv4

9459619,0,t3_5aaipv,First things first get a bed and water pump built at Red Rocket to give you a place to sleep and fresh water. Empty bottles you find can be filled at the pump for purified water. As far as food you might need to hang on to prewar food that you scavenge in Concord until you get a decent stockpile of foodstuffs. Razorgrain can be combined with Dirty water to make Noodle soup and Razorgrain can be grown at settlements fill up bottles in the river for dirty water. Also note that you can get illnesses some are pretty mild others pretty much have to be healed immediately like Infection. Antibiotics or a visit to a doctor will do it. Antibiotics can be crafted with the chemist perk and theres a molerat den right behind Red Rocket that has the primary ingredient Glowing green fungus. Otherwise theyre hard to findbuy early on. Covenant has a doctor thats not too far off.

9694179,0,t3_5drpar,As others have said ho in blind enjoy the game. Take your time. Explore every nook and cranny. With Bethesda games the main story is only a small part of the game. Dont rush it. Enemies get stronger the further south and east you go or basically the further you are from the starting area so try to explore and do all that you can before moving deeper. Explore all of the factions. They all have great stories and will have you going to new areas but dont let any quest rush you. If you have questions on game mechanics just ask. I have over  hours played and Im glad to help. No way of playing is really wrong although you may struggle morewith a one builds than others. You may be tempted to take weapon damage increasing perks early on but Id suggest focusin on other stuff first.,fo4,da80ho7,2,t5_2tzv4

9707711,0,t3_5dzqic,Have you considered gunslinger? Not just as a secondary weapon but as your primary sniper. Carry weight is probably the biggest difficulty of all the restrictions added to survival. Instead of carrying a sniper rifle and shotgun which will both be pretty heavy you can carry multiple pistols. With maxed gunslinger a laser or plasma pistol modded for sniping sniper barrel beam focuser etc. has much longer range than any rifle about twice as much a a combat or gauss rifle. Instigating laser pistol old faithful is sold in diamond city will still be easily one shotting most enemies at least up to level . Combine it with a vats monster like Deliverer for close range and Kelloggs pistol to refill ap on demand both free and you are equipped to handle pretty much anything with less weight than one heavily modded rifle. If you want more firepower the alien blaster or a wounding laser pistol with beam scatterer both make excellent up close oh shit weapons.As for local leader I think settlements help out a lot even if you dont really build them up or have high population. Having a doctor bed decontamination arch and plenty of fresh water and turrets to mow down anything chasing you within sprinting distance of pretty much anywhere is very handy. Settlements without supply lines is a huge hassle. With supply lines just drop all your junk mods and ingredients every time you pass a work bench and then you can build craft or cook whatever you need wherever.,fo4,da9omeu,2,t5_2tzv4

9710218,0,t3_5e5exb,The part that makes veterans so furious about FO is because it is extremely obvious how awesome the game could have been by putting something around half a year of developement more into the games inner workings.  This is a problem of pretty much all modern games You play them and remember old games that were similar and had those little mechanics or things to them that gave them alot more charisma than what we get today.  What lacks most obviously in FO are the attribute based dialogue and quest options which really influenced the way you would experience the game in earlier titles and thus gave every playthrough an ultimate personal touch in FO it has beyond charisma no influence on either. That makes vets sad because it wouldnt have been alot of work and it gives the game so extremely much more.  Then we have the storys. Ive heard Bethesda fired the guy who was writing real storys for them after they finished Morrowind and I immediatly believe that without researching the matter There just isnt much background in the world which wasnt already there in the other titles. The game always feels like a facade of a postapocalyptic world instead of being the real thing. It is so close to the real thing that it enrages me alone thinking about how fucking awesome a game would be with a world that breathes its story just like the old Fallout titles and NV or said Morrowind did.    TLDR  The game got alot of hate because the little things that were around in earlier titles arent there anymore and you feel at every corner of the game now with that feature this couldve been awesome this way its only cool,fo4,da9zri0,1,t5_2tzv4

Its also why the Institute amasses wave after wave of Institute synths to try and prevent Liberty Prime from reaching the Institute when he does become mobile and operational  because they are well aware of the existence of Liberty Prime.Furthermore the Prydwen isnt a secret either its an airship populated by a formidable amount of soldiers. The Institute doesnt have any aerial capabilities. There is no danger. Under the premise youve addressed everyone already knows X is a member of the Institute and youre acting as if soldiers wouldnt be keeping an eye on him when he enters the Boston Airport in the company of the Sole Survivor.

While the MM had a General and ranks the structure was still largely Anarchist in that you had groups of peers supporting each other. The Officers didnt run any other aspect of peoples lives or act as a government their authority was restricted to combat responses only. They were taskbased temporary authority.The Minutemen also kind of follow the arc of a union that starts strong and falls to corruption.

10116004,0,t3_5kk4pe,I just started a survival play through right before Christmas.Im playing as Benjamin Linus from LOST. I chose him as an antiheroantagonist so I can play a little more evil instead of defaulting to what Id do in real life which I assure you is NOT evil.All I can say is WOW.I have the following mods installed Xbone True Storms Darker Nights Immersive Gameplay Simple Green Ponytail Hairstyles Loving CaitPiperCurie Armor Smith Still working out the load for this one Cannibal in Concord Campsite Plenty of ExplorationNote this is not my load orderOnce again... WOW.Ive played through Fallout  twice so far before this and loved every second of it. But this survival save... Its something else entirely.Im scared to leave SanctuaryRed Rocket. Even with my nuka world sleeping bag I only take one gun and one kind of ammunition and Dogmeat and I go and explore the surrounding area. You really do feel as if you are trying to survive in the wasteland now.I came out of my prewar bunker IG mod and walked out of my house to a dustfog storm. It was breathtaking. I decided to use that cover to go Red Rocket for Dogmeat. as I was checking out the garage I heard the sound of molerats surfacing. In a panic I closed the garage door and waited in the corner with my eye on the door. One by one they came through the door dying to my modded hunting rifle.  It was terrifying yet awesome. Never before in this game did I regard mole rats with anything more than mild annoyance. now seeing a glowing green mole rat run towards you is reason enough to run like hell.Its worth noting that with the IG mod Ive noticed that aggressive creatures are not always aggressive anymore. Mole rats really only rush me when they are in groups now If I find one on its own it runs from Dogmeat and me. Quite interesting.,fo4,dbq4g4y,1,t5_2tzv4

Next go to goodneigher and kill every last person and ghoul. Kill every single vaultdweller and peaceful hermitscavenger you can find. Use mods to kill all your companions and just when you think there is no one left and that you have committed every sin the commonwealth offers think again. Time to commit the most terrible deed in the game. Tell Dogmeat to watch the rabbits and put your revolver to the back of his head. Then pull the trigger.

10163224,0,t3_5lijxn,It truly is one game that knows how to actually use random events to its advantage in a way I think most players expect it to. Lots of other games have random elements that can create dynamic situations without the player being involved but theyre never done well enough or in a scope and scale that makes it obvious.Grand Theft Auto has really good talent for creating those same types of dynamic events but they are usually subtle things like how traffic flows and pedestrians react things you may not actually see because theyre minor in the background and youre usually doing something else at the time.But Fallout  actually does it right. They take the old concept of random encounters like youd run into playing Fallout  and  you take a bunch of specific NPC types and have them spawn around the player. This is pretty common in many games with dynamic unscripted events too but Fallout  then takes it a little bit further with the whole faction system that it handles behind the scenes IE for things that arent even in a faction are actually in a  hidden faction class that can be friends or foes with other faction classes and spawns in a variety of groups that all have different objectives. Some of them are just walking from point a to point b some of them are searching and destroying all hostiles some of them are actually looting things from the ground and containers. And they dont stop there. Instead of just one thing being spawned in around you at least  things can be going on at once and all converge right in your general vicinity to create some truly awesome unscripted moments far more reliably than other games that claim to offer the same shit.,fo4,dbw237d,7,t5_2tzv4

It can be very useful.If you want to upgrade your weapons and armour Adhesive is important so look for Duct Tape and Wonderglue. Vegetable Starch can be crafted in the Cooking Station with Corn Mutfruit Tato and Purified Water which gives  Adhesive.As far as perks go figure out what kind of weapon you want to use.  The three main ones in the beginning are Guns Gunslinger SemiAuto rifles Rifleman and Melee Weapons Big Leagues. Try out the different kinds and choose the one you find the most fun and spec for that kind at the start. Sneak is useful so consider getting the Sneak perk upgraded at some point.

10430771,0,t1_dcqcdbp,While I dont say the Courier should have had a backstory I do think one could have added a better dimension to some of the choices.  One example is the choice to back the Legion. More people IMO chose the legion simply as they wanted to play the courier as a bad guy. However what if the couriers backstory had included losing his family in a Bitter Springs type incident or some other event involving the NCR. It could have made the motive for supporting the Legion something more than simply LOLevuls reasons.    I have to say I dont really think the Courier necessarily has more backstory simply because most of it comes from an obsessed stalker Ulysses who shows a lot of signs of mental issues so his ramblings are suspect. I suspect he is attempting to deal with guilt by transferring blame. He blames you for the destruction of that community in The Divide but all you did was deliver a package. From his conversation it is shown that he knows what the device looked like since he mentions its markings. He says the device called out but never actually goes so far as to say you triggered it. I think he could have done that himself while turning it in his hands and inspecting its markings. He talks about barely surviving the event while all the rest were killed but never mentions how or why you survived as well. That makes it more likely you were long gone before it happened and so werent even there to trigger it. Afterwards he attempts to lessen his crushing guilt by blaming you for giving him the gun in the first place.,fo4,dcqeaww,1,t5_2tzv4

If it is then this is a question that will be important as us humans dive into genetic manipulation ourselves.

10570352,0,t3_5r9uv7,Yes but the problems with the dialogue are a result of going voiced. They did a voiced protagonist well enough it just didnt belong. Fallout  is a great game I just dont find it replay able because of the dialogue. Its made it so no matter what you are always playing NateNora. I cant play the characters I want to because they all feel the same. Its not even a matter of not enough dialogue its a matter of none of the choices feel different enough to feel like another character. Another problem with it is npc development. It comes in spurts. You get moments where the npc will hurl a monologue at young and thats where you learn their personality. In previous Beth games there were options that opened up more questions for you to ask if you wanted or theyd spurt off a comment on an action you had recently done. You got their opinions and characteristics more slower and more paced out. You could get a huge character dump at once but only if you pushed them for it or you were a smooth enough talker. Yould also find things out about a character in a subsequent playthough because you chose a different path. Far Harbor did it better than the main game but it was still missing. This has lead to being able to know exactly what any main quest npc is going to say next because its always the same.But the big thing that was missing was the inner dialogue skill checks. For example instead of the SS just assuming Shaun was still a baby if she had enough perks in Science or a high enough intelligence he could deduce that Shaun might be older and tell Nick. Or have enough CharismaLocal Leader to devise another plan of attack for retaking the castle. Or use the Intimidate perk to make some of the criminals stop during the Silver Shroud quest. None of these would change much except reduce the combat a bit or skip a quest objective but it would go miles into feeling like you were playing a personalized character. I will not say New Vegas vanilla is a better game. Its not. But it does have  far superior dialogue. Tldr Fos dialogue is fine but lead to major lack of replay ability.,fo4,dd68yoo,2,t5_2tzv4

These a figurines that more accessible to more people and come in a huge range so you can finally have that figurine of an obscure character you love on your desk.Some people find the style cute too which opens it up younger kids teamed up with low price point they make great gifts.I agree though personally i cant see much  appeal for my tastes but i can understand why others like them.,fo4,ddmrf17,2,t5_2tzv4

10840482,0,t3_5uzl8y,I think people try treat survival like a normal gameplay but really you shouldnt yes you still can follow the quest line but you really dont need to. My survival has really been mostly about establishing settlements with minimal setup shops beds etc when I am bored I will build them up a little more each time.I spend most of my time wondering around collecting stuff. I made it my rule not to cheat duplicate or use any mods this way to keep it real. Anything you can buy or acquire without the use of cheats or mods is game. Who cares if you get an OP weapon if it is part of the game. I have yet to find any amazing legendary weapons during my survival the best so far I think is my Wounding Shotgun but havent found any explosive weapons double shot gauss rifles or anything yet.I didnt use PA until I was around level  which I was waiting to get my hands on the Xwhich is relatively easy to get so I didnt go near any PA which I knew the locations because I didnt want it to spawn a T except the Atoms Cats which I knew would be a T so no loss. I didnt actually use it but for the record PA will help you survive mines and grenades instead of the many instant deaths I had which was just annoying.Now I wonder around in X PA as well as I have got my companion which has really only been Piper I dont bother with any other companions I mostly did it initially to gain the extra XP but I also prefer piper although I miss Codsworth.Once you have PA it really changes the game somewhat you can still die easily in PA but just not as easily I still let Piper take the brunt of the action I am forever repairing her PA which in a lot of cases in stripped down because of all the action she sees I find this funny.Get some PA I think it will change the game go steal the T from Atom Cats upgrade it put your perks towards armourer so you can upgrade your PA to MKVII this is a bit of a game changer.I also love the fact that enemies dont respawn and I wonder the wasteland mostly undisturbed now that I killed everyone on my usual routes. If I hear voices in a building on my regular main routes I will go in an clear them out. Some of them respawn but most remain dead.Take your time stand on top of cars when fighting things like dogs or in buildings.I made my main base Hangmans Ally left the doors locked moved most of my companions there with few settlers setup egret Marina as my water purifier plant. I rarely go back to Sanctuary in fact I am around level  and I probably have only revisited Sanctuary  times I moved Preston to Overland station so I can access him close by for quests.I will do the main quest line only because I am bored and looking for something to do but I have hardly done any quests so far I have done a few minuteman quests to grab the castle and more importantly the The Last Minute which I gave to my companion its fun watching them carry a big gun around.Survival is supposed to be different gameplay dont feel you need to do the quest line lots of places to explore so much to see you dont need to waste them on quests unless you want to. I havent even gotten near Nuka World or Far Harbour yet just been wondering the wasteland like a lost sole  I also enjoy the challenge of having to find a bed personally I find this the best part.,fo4,ddy4ald,3,t5_2tzv4

10871439,0,t3_5vdiho,The vanilla game offers no way for the institute and the railroad to coexist.  Its supposed to be reminiscent of the civil war in the US.  The institute has a vested interest in keeping their slaves so they are unwilling to consider they might be more than robots.  The railroad sees the institute as oppressors denying the natural rights any sentient being deserves.  The only way it might be resolved is if one of them changes their outlook.  And the only way that could conceivably happen is after you take over in charge of the institute.  Unfortunately the vanilla game doesnt give you that option.  Of course if you are on PC and dont mind using mods you can install Main Quest Choices Extended  That allows you to basically tell the railroad you are going to take over the institute and make them treat synths with respect.  That way you can complete the institute quest line without murdering everyone in the railroad.,fo4,de1b80e,3,t5_2tzv4

The Railroad keep on stealing Synths and they use lethal weapons to protect the Synths if the Institute try to get them back.

I know for you its more than a party which is why everything counts but surviving in PostApocalyptia is all about making sure you get the balance right with your new life.  After waking from cryogenic sleep you have to be flexible with all the future has to hold  you cant spend all your time trying to shake the disease of radiation sickness or youll be in a master and servant relationship with a group of slavers.  On the other hand you cant live in the past with your stories of old which are nothing more than blasphemous rumors to those still alive.  Theres always something to do which means you have to work hard towards a better life if you want things to be more than a world full of nothing.  And then theres Nick. The logo for his detective agency?  Well its called a heart but he doesnt have one.  I guess he can count on love in itself but it would be a shame if a synth named Valentine never discovers the meaning of love.Anyways OP you thought your shitpost was going to be a pleasure little treasure?

11083363,0,t1_deo72gw,I may give this a try but I kind of doubt that it will help a lot with my setup as it has a decent  era GPU NVIDIA GeForce GTX  GB and a old  CPU Core Xeon E quad core GHz . roughly comparable to a modern i CPU which puts the CPU at roughly the minimum system requirement while the GPU is closer to the recommended requirement.I would expect anisotropic filtering to be GPU accelerated so it shouldnt to be to much of an issue for my GPU. Handling of the large number of complex shadows between buildings in central Boston is on the other hand to my understanding  more of a CPU issue which my setup is more sensitive to. Shadow Boost results in roughly  fps in areas where I would otherwise get  so its a great boost for playability. ,fo4,deoafg3,3,t5_2tzv4

11104382,0,t3_5yj6j1,Not so far in FO but I have in Skyrim.Part of the problem is the complete lack of support for uninstalling mods or DLC for that matter. For mods that replace textures or alter the value of existing variables this isnt a big deal. If the mod is removed the game will cleanly revert back to its vanilla state.But if a mod has anything that is included in your save file things like scripts then it should really never be removed. Even with the tools available to the PC there is no way to guarantee a clean removal. To be  sure that removing a scripted mod wont bake issues into your save file you have to go back to a save made before the mod was ever installed once it has been removed. This is doubly true for consoles since some mods can be somewhat safely removed with access to the console to stop scripts before removing the mod or even trigger an uninstall script before removing the mod.So I guess if you absolutely want to avoid this issue then stay away from scripted mods essentially any mod that adds to the game rather than one that only modifies existing features.,fo4,deqo7l5,2,t5_2tzv4

11108277,0,t1_deqqyuy,Im just holding out until the modders finish translating fo to the fo engine and hoping that will give us the best of both worlds. I think the biggest problem with fo wasnt that they were focused on the graphics as much as the teams werent communicating. They also heavily leaned on their randomly generated quests which dont really feel good to play. It feels like the art code and story teams all kind of did their own thing. So many well crafted areas that are entirely devoid of story elements and every quest is rather limited in what it can make the player do. So many side quests are either randomly generated or very simple that its obvious the story writers didnt have much to do with them.I highly recommend Far Harbor if you havent played it. They dont use any of the stupid randomly generated quests and theres even a few skill checks and quests that dont involve murdering things. It makes for a much better experience.,fo4,der43gm,1,t5_2tzv4

If you have Gage as a companion he pretty well describes a raiders mindset how they get into the life and what they hope to get out of it. In all the park there might be a handful of raiders who would want to give it up maybe.It is a bit of a shame that once you do kill them off you dont have an option to get more settlers in try to build it up like it was before the gangs showed up. It could have been as simple as making the parks safe and planting a settler flag if the gangs had been killed off.The idea that you are missing out on most of the DLC if you kill the gangs is false though. The bulk of the content is in exploring the parks and environments and that is the same whether or not you are doing it for the gangs. You just dont assign it to anyone at the end if you are not. All you miss out on if you kill them right off is setting up raider outposts in the commonwealth and the big fight at the power plant plus the perks and gifts you get.,fo4,dfihvc5,1,t5_2tzv4

You get an option with every companion that can be romanced when they stop you to talk and you dont need to pass any except for the final one to get them as a partner. Passing the first check makes the second and third check easier passing the second check makes the third check easier and passing the third check is what makes them your partner.Other than that youll find a few during quests.

I only knew that there is another faction brotherhood after being forced to choose a faction to fight for .. then i bingemissioned their stuffYoure contradicting yourself again That is the point I am trying to make. If you have been on the Prydwen then bingemissioned their stuff you have obviously met the Brotherhood of Steel. Please stop saying you never met them.As for being forced to choose a faction to fight for after getting the Courser Chip you need to choose a faction to help you build the thing to get into the institute but you dont need to stay loyal to that faction. your not bound to any faction until well after you have gotten into the Institute. Judging from your previous gaming experience with linear story driven games you are not prepared for the open ended nature of Fallout. Just relax and pay very close attention to what you are doing and your quest log. The great thing about Fallout is that there is no wrong way to play it. Your just not experienced in a game that lets you craft your own story. You would be even more lost if you were playing Fallout New Vegas. that game is much more open and has far more options on how you complete quest and the main story. I have done  playthroughs now Each one was a different experience because I changed the way I played the faction I sided with and the elements of the game I focused on.

11636896,0,t3_65wddu,Looking at it from purely a story perspective he is a fairly wellwritten and deep character especially in comparison to the Fallout  companion.However...he has been written to be obsessively fixated on the Minutemen.  Just as an example if you dont do the early Tenpines quest he wont help you at all.  He hangs around Sanctuary Hills and wont direct you to Sturges to build the teleport mechanism to get to the Institute if you havent taken care of Tenpines first.Its also arguable that he makes you a figurehead for the Minutemen then basically runs everything and treats you as an agent.  To an extent his approach is remarkably similar to Gage in the NukaWorld DLC.  Gage is actually more up front about it freely admitting he prefers to be the man behind the throne.His dialog for you in a relationship can also be perceived as irritatingly condescending.So ignoring the quest mechanics YMMV with regard to Preston.,fo4,dgf1zsa,2,t5_2tzv4
