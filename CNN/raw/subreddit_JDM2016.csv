8420632,0,t3_4u0f86,The format of this course is definitely different from any other course I have taken and after the first contact and listening to the podcast I am genuinely excited to see what the rest of the course has to offer! The contact was extremely interactive and forced me to think and question the way I make decisions. I loved listening to the podcast and I seemed to have retained a lot more information than I thought I would. I think this course will challenge me but Im excited to learn more about critical thinking and decisionmaking as these are definitely skills that are necessary in everyday life. ,JDM2016,d5u4ean,1,t5_3fjyp
8751964,0,t3_4zf2m5,For some reason this is by far the most difficulty I have had trying to convey my thoughts for a discussion post! Looking back on some of my past experiences the reason I  was slow to change my situation was because I justified to myself that where I was at was good enough. Sure there were really dodgy aspects of where I  was at but atleast they were predictably dodgy. Id gotten used to them. Changing my situation wouldve meant accepting new unknown negatives. Safe is probably the word I would use. It felt safer to stay put. ,JDM2016,d6znhyf,1,t5_3fjyp
8752943,0,t3_4zf2m5,I think a really valid point from the podcast was saying how the status quo bias may not be as relevant and helpful for the society that we live in today. The risk of leaving an awful job where finding another one may not have been plausible or leaving a marriage where the judgementacceptance of finding a second partner is no where near relevant as it would have been in previous times. And also with career choice people have a more riskfree environment in which to experiment with jobs as it is far less likely to a be put on the street and b have a family to support right off the bat. But people still stay? Perhaps because fear of the unknown comes into play. I certainly have been scared to leave jobs if even they were terrible simply because I had never experienced anything different so there seemed little possibility of finding something better. Maybe it has something to do with loss aversion ? we can much better imagine the losses if we were to leave a jobmarriage than the gains to be had in doing so?,JDM2016,d6zrx0d,1,t5_3fjyp
8807084,0,t1_d6qh8tr,I think this is a really cool idea! If you are concerned about biting off more than you can chew with the  minutes try simplifying your experiment a little. Instead of  minutes on your tails days shoot for  minutes or simply a conscious act of kindness. Deciding on your dependent measures seems to be the trickiest part here. It would be pretty neat to compare your average daily rating of happiness your average daily rating of your brothers happiness and your parents average daily rating of your and your brothers happiness. Provided your parents are blind to your experiment theyd provide a nice control to your own ratings. You are definitely on the right track Id just encourage you to simplify your design and think carefully about your dependent measures. ,JDM2016,d76hpxk,1,t5_3fjyp
8827705,0,t1_d76h724,I was thinking of daily motivational quotes that are posted by instagram pages. So I would pick one quote for which I would live by for that day. Generally reading quotes related to positivity makes me feel better for that day and boosts my confidence in being able to face each day. I believe this is why people follow instagram pages such as the good quote etc. Therefore it is something I would expect to work for me. However I have never tested it properly to see its short term effect on my happiness and selfconfidence as well as possibly its long term effect on my education. I think reading positive quotes would make me better emotionally prepared to face a day and would put me in a more motivated mood to study. Therefore exam results seem like good measures to test. In terms of the best possible intervention rather than trying something like exercise or an improved diet I would want to try an internalemotional change which could ultimately improve my life for the better. Also since positive quotes are easy to access if my hypothesis is proven it is a habit I can easily use in the future to enhance the stability of my emotions. In this case my control would be days I do not read the quotes determined by a coin toss.,JDM2016,d78yu7z,1,t5_3fjyp
8835527,0,t3_50fes6,I think that personal preferences to what you like and dislike arise from previous experiences and influences. The human nature to stick to the status quo limits us to what we think we would like  dislike when faced with new experiences. I believe that we are our own authority in choosing personal preferences but only based on what we have tried and been exposed to. Therefore we should try to be more open with new experiences to reduce confirmation bias. We can not judge what we dislike or like beforehand if we have not experienced the activity ourselves first hand. While a systematic approach seems logical and would help us discover new approaches and opinions I dont think its necessary to apply to every element of our lives due to inefficiency.,JDM2016,d79wmhf,1,t5_3fjyp
8920251,0,t3_52auzg,I think making predictions may lead to hopefully subtle bias but at the same time Open Science has its positives in that it does enable honesty between researchers as to what they are looking for and by collaborating with others it can keep people in check. Thus any bias can be hopefully counteracted or stopped. I think the line between observation and science is drawn through the rigors set into place the variables being controlled and the steps of research and hypothesises. Just observing a perceived cause and effect may be enough for someone to first obtain an idea for an experiment but it certainly isnt science. On the topic of controlled experiments versus MRA. I think that they are treated equally because MRA is so common and easy to use although controlled experiments are better in finding valid results. Lastly I do not believe experimental psychologists could calibrate their measurements like astronomers calibrate their telescopes yes the stars do change position but they can be reliably to my knowledge predicted whereas often people and their variances cannot as we tend to be a bit more unique in our behaviour patterns and are influenced heavily by situations. Something that the night sky is not. ,JDM2016,d7k30tm,1,t5_3fjyp
8991745,0,t3_52tf9o,The question that sticks out to me is Would you be more likely to change your behavior after running a selfexperiment than you would if you just read about the same experiment on other people?. This is particularly important when considering my selfexperiment. I hope I will be more likely to change my behavior however I am not convinced. As Jason suggested in the podcast although he is aware using his phone does not benefit his mood on phonedays he finds himself using just as often regardless. My experiment focuses on positive and negative thoughts and how they affect my overall moodstate of mind by the end of the day. While I assume having negative thoughts will negatively impact my state of mind Im interested to see HOW much of an effect it has. That isnt to say that it is going to stop me from having negative thoughts though. But it might persuade me of the effect and hopefully make me more aware of it.... Selfexperiment is unreliable in any aspect other than persuading oneself. And even so is subject to a number of biases such as confirmation bias. I think selfexperimentation is an interesting concept and should be encouraged if only on a superficial level i.e. should not be used to provide scientific reasoning. ,JDM2016,d7so3mn,1,t5_3fjyp
9216347,0,t3_55s9tz,Rather then rationalizing which of the objectcentric or situationcentric perspective is better I think both are useful in that they can be applied to various contexts. Objectcentric allows for scientific and objective rules and thought while situationcentric helps in a case to case basis while allowing for less rigid ways of thinking. I feel as if both are valuable schools of thought. However after thinking about it this middle line answer seems more like a situationcentric response.Dialectical reasoning seems to have elements of both conscious and unconscious reasoning. In accepting that contextual exceptions do occur dialectical reasoning would incur conscious thought in the learning and application of these exceptions. However unconscious thought also occurs in observing situations as a whole which was supported by the faces experiment in Nisbetts chapters.I think wisdom is the effective use of these two systems of thought. Wisdom would be able to be applied in a large situational basis however would follow some set of rules. It would be the application and also the extrapolation of these rules into more abstract thought that wouldnt limit the individual into believing such a strict set of rules but also rigid enough to come to a logical conclusion.On a side note what came to mind during this week was if someone had an eastern background but was brought up in a western civilization or vice versa and how it would have effected their ways of thinking. Obviously there would be a spectrum of how Eastern or Western the thinking was but it was curious to think about nonetheless.,JDM2016,d8k8npn,1,t5_3fjyp
