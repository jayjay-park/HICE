386446,0,t3_1yiezm, incredibly easy to drive as a standard. Shifting is a bit notchy in a good way IMO maybe not for others?. Im considering teaching my girlfriend to drive it based on how easy it is.   if you regularly drive adult passengers in the rear you may want to look elsewhere. Im  and I really couldnt find a way to sit back there. For your occasional ride here or there sure youll be fine but dont expect to rely on it and certainly not for long periods of time.  no sense in getting rid of the stock tires since they are quality summers so if your region sees snow you will  be buying winters. I had the pleasure of driving it home during the storm we got on Tuesday up here in the northeast and it was miserable. I got stuck at the bottom of a hill once and had to turn around. I would have driven my Jeep had I known the snow would be so bad but I got caught. I will have a set for next winter I havent had any issues with the Sync system and its actually the best infotainment system Ive had in a car. Its light years behind a smartphone but thats to be expected. The nav I could take or leave mine has it but Id be fine without. Id like the POI voice navigation to be better its frustrating to not be able to find more places. No problems with it being laggy or slow yet.Ive had it a month as of tomorrow and I have nothing but glowing reviews for it.  The snow situation aside its a brilliant ride.  Not sure if youve driven a Focus ST yet but I liked the Fiesta much better. The Focus is nice but its not quite as peppyfunquick and for k Id probably buy a WRX premium or whatever trim is equivalent. Edit Also Recaros Recaros Recaros. ,FiestaST,cfktkc4,4,t5_2z1b5

4570006,0,t3_3dije9,As far as break in goes if you dont take up to or near redline during break on it wont want to later. Make sure its completely warmed up  minutes or more off driving     then take it up slowly and back off. As it says dont drive at any one RPM but constantly vary the engine speed........across the WHOLE range. Ive had mine for about a year and a half and just learned that it has  shift assist. When you are up shifting when you push in the clutch the RPMs will fall but will hold for just a sec when the Rs match the MPH.  Let out clutch when you see the tach pause and you get a perfectly smooth upshift. ,FiestaST,ct6nsy1,2,t5_2z1b5
4570984,0,t3_3djrnn,I live in the area and I can give some insight. The track was owned by Larry H. Miller a local business mogul car dealership Utah Jazz owner theater chains etc. This track was his pet project since he had a deep love for motorsports. He died a few years ago and his son picked up where he left off. The son recently died as well and nobody else in the family had the interest to keep it so they let the lease expire. The city of Tooele may decide to keep it running but they need a buyer. Itd be a shame to let it go to waste but the future of the track is up in the air at this point. ,FiestaST,ct6s7tb,1,t5_2z1b5

5644273,0,t1_cwrmk3m,gt I think this may be a testament to just how sticky and grippy the RER tire is more than anything. It takes away that slippage that lets you know the car has hard enough going into a turn because it exceeds the capability of the car. The grip is so god damned unlimited and the sidewall so stiff that it overpowers the chassis which is at the same time has such a high center of gravity and narrow wheel base that the rest of the car leans into the turn with it and comes off the ground. It wont slide because it cannot break grip so where else is it going to go? Theyre basically race tires made for a road racing track. I literally mean that. Bridgestone has called them drag slicks with tread cut into them to make them road legal.Agreed.  Looking at them they seem to be the currentgeneration followup to the RER.  I ran a set of those on my E and the grip was absolutely absurd.  I could enter a turn at pretty much any speed the little .L motor could get it to and the car would go around like it was on rails.Its just physics from there.  Theres a reason race cars are generally as low and wide as they can get away with.,FiestaST,cwwq62p,2,t5_2z1b5
5645418,0,t1_cwwv0n2,The added movement in the stock mount results in undesirable driving situations such as loss of traction increased wheelspin wheel hop excessive engine movement when shifting and many other problems. By replacing the soft mount with something more stiff like ours you are essentially making the car put the power to the ground better and much more efficiently than before.  ,FiestaST,cwwva1m,5,t5_2z1b5

5764954,0,t1_cxbggtx,Heres what I noticed after having done mine mountune. Before under hard acceleration in first or second gear the car would kind of  scrabble for traction. That is it would pull from side to side as first one side got traction then the other. As a result of what I assume was wheel hop actually one side losing traction and a power transfer to the other wheel. That is now gone. Under hard acceleration it simply GOESalbeit with a hint of torque steer. I noticed a bit of vibration and most defiantly more sound when the air conditioner was running at idle only and that lasted for about  miles but the last time a checked for it I couldnt tell any difference whether it was on or off the vibration being gone. ,FiestaST,cxbp20t,3,t5_2z1b5

6451061,0,t3_44086q, weeks in the U.S. has been a reliable range. I ordered myself and it was right at about .Price is always negotiable but many dealers will not be interested. I had to go a fair distance outside my local area for the best price. Many local dealers had little interest in me when I said I wanted to order. Try a high volume dealer make sure you get everything on paper with predetermined OTD prices and a guarantee they will give you the current incentives or the better ones if they come out by delivery. My experience was great personally but my sales guy was awesome.Im ish  lbs. The Recaros are pretty damn awesome. They may not be quite as comfortable on the long trips as my old FRS but they are way more supportive for aggressive driving. The car is pretty comfortable overall on the interstate but it is a tad loud. Elsewhere the ride can be a bit choppy due to the stiff suspension and short wheelbase. If you got tired of either of those issues you can move to smaller wheels. If you are a solo driver most of the time and like a firm communicative ride you should be good.

They have off a nice unique blue hue but they didnt give off many lumens. I was worried about getting pulled over since you couldnt really see the plate so I purchased the new ones. Theyre knock offs of the Phillips bulb which are  for ! I wasnt having that so I found these and started replacing everything!Your right the back one in the hatch was super easy and the second one I did. I then worked my way forward and replaced them all. The middle dome was ridiculously involved to replace. Not hard but literally have to take the entire assembly apart to replaced them... in the end it was worth it though. Pro tip!If your doing yours as well make sure to plug the assembly back in BEFORE bolting it all back together to make sure the polarity is right on the bulbs. If they dont light up flip the bulb in the socket. Easier to do this before putting it all back together. Pro tip !The front light assembly I have a sun roof has clips on the side of it holding it in. I pulled down slightly on the unit and used a plastic trim tool to slide up the side of the assembly then press the tool in towards the light to compress the clip. The unit will then drop out of the ceiling. Do NOT just pull on it like Im the back you can break or bend the clips or worse jack up your ceiling panel...,FiestaST,d1ij75x,1,t5_2z1b5

8826037,0,t1_d7870zu,Yellowstuff is the highest performing street pad but also the highest dusting. They dust a TON. Very high heat tolerance with a focus on maintaining pedal travel and feel. These allegedly do not fade and i will be getting to put that to the test next weekend. They stop noticeably better than stock and seem to help the torque vectoring out a bit more in autocross from the few runs I did last weekend before getting rained out. I have a longer event with more runs tomorrow to test these. They also make weird noises when hot or having been beaten on for a bit and smell like fish that is going bad when you first open the box.The EBC Redstuff is about the same as oem maybe a bit better. They respond better as they get hot. They dont dust nearly as much as oem and are typically quieter. Made from kevlar and ceramic. They might survive one or two track days like the OEM pads but only if youre newer to those types of events.The Redstuff will perform somewhere between the Mountune RSR Basically the same as Hawk HPS and the RST Basically Hawk HPS. Mountune swears they are specially made by Hawk for them as a better compound but they claim a lot of things as this thread has indicated.EBC Greenstuff dusts about the same as Redstuff but has the least amount of bite and wont stand up to track days at all. Might survive a year of autocross but wont stop the car as well as OEM might.The one thing that confused me most about EBC pads is that not all of them have shims preinstalled which is the material that goes between the caliper and the back of the pad. My rears did fronts did not. For the front they give you an adhesive backing you have to cut yourself. A bit of a pain in the ass but not too bad.You shouldnt need new rotors for the car except for maybe up front depending on how many miles you have and how you drive. You could probably get away with just pad slapping the car which means just swapping on pads. I recently discovered my back rotors and brakes were barely worn at all despite autocrossing and tracking the car and k miles on top of it. Front rotors werent that worn either and I could have gotten away with it but I opted to bed them into fresh rotors anyways.Also if you havent done brakes on this car before you will need a set of locking pliersvise grip pliers to undo the two caliper bolts or they will just spin when trying to remove them. The caliper bolts are all mm Ratcheting wrench is amazing to have for this and the caliper cradle thing the pads mount in is a mm wrench. This was the most annoying part for me. Also the screw that hold the brake line onto the clip attached to the frame Its convenient to undo it so you can hang the caliper easier is basically made of graphite. Dont overtighten it or it will snap clean in two.Get a really good dust mask and plenty of wire brushes and brake cleaner. Its dusty as hell down there. Maybe a fan blowing away from you while you clean the caliper bracket and caliper wouldnt be a bad idea either. The dust is REALLY bad and REALLY bad for you.,FiestaST,d78rmyp,2,t5_2z1b5

Idling will cause raw fuel to push past the piston seals into the engine oil. Car being direct injected having way higher fuel injection pressures will dilute the engine oil even more. This decreases the oils ability to lubricate.As a side note a car warms up quicker if youre driving.

I think people are safely wringing the current FiST on stock valve train out to  but theres no point on the stock turbo. I dont think there are any reliability concerns due to redline.Speaking of the turbo thats what Im really curious about. I wonder if they stuck with the KP or got something a little more advanced.,FiestaST,de5la0v,4,t5_2z1b5

This certainly sounds promising though I might have to risk it! gt FORScan Lite limitation differencies from FORScan for Windows  ampnbsp   No Test and Service chapters. Tests is going to be added in the future Support of Bluetooth and WiFi adapters only. USB support may be added in the future Only Android v. and newer devices are supported. We do not plan yet to support older versions in our opinion amount of such devices is already insignificant This version of application is built only for ARMv architecture. If your device has another one or you dont know what it is but the application doesnt work please send us model and name of your device  we will add necessary archs. Only English language is supported yet other of supported languages planned to be added later  ampnbsp  Rest of main functionality is identical to otherversions as all versions Windows Android iOS are built on the same kernel  so only GUI is different.,FiestaST,de7atu9,1,t5_2z1b5

11047484,0,t1_dejfdq4,Its not about resale its about parts.  Honda Civics and Accords are some of the most stolen cars in the US IIRC not because anyone wants the whole car but because theres a massive market looking for cheap parts.  Anything without a VIN on it is effectively untraceable.Fiestas seem to be a lot more popular overall in Europe which likely means a lot of them getting in fender benders and such which means a demand for replacement parts.  If the legal market prices are high enough theres room for a profitable black market underneath.,FiestaST,dek7osa,3,t5_2z1b5

11125017,0,t3_5yrspl,In my experience other cars not the FiST its a wash. That is the better fuel economy at higher price of premium gasoline exactly matches the lower mileage of the cheaper fuel. May as well go with the better fuel...cleaner engine more power. ,FiestaST,det0f35,1,t5_2z1b5

Theres a hundred dollar deductible per occurrence so its not like youre not still coming out of pocket.

11351345,0,t3_61zvvn,I have not done studs on the Fiesta but typically they press out and the new ones press in and use the knurling to retain them. There should be no clocking on them for putting the new ones in. Just make sure they go in pretty tight.,FiestaST,dfink1c,1,t5_2z1b5
11352778,0,t1_dfir4tw,I wouldnt think thats great nor is it terrible. If the car was driven in a spirited fashion and they were heavy on the brakes then its not outside of the realm of possibility. The OEM brakes on the car are quite good but do generate a LOT of dust. k seems a bit low but not out of the question depending on the drivers habits. Id check to see what they replaced the pads amp rotors with OEM vs aftermarket.,FiestaST,dfited5,1,t5_2z1b5
11403722,0,t3_620403,Completely normal as far as Im aware.

11442518,0,t1_dfs7cqp,Thatd work but itd be hard to get a straight cut even harder without cutting into the silver plastic part. Theres this stuff called knifeless tape I havent used it yet but itd be perfect for this. Its plastic tape with a metal wire in it. You lay it down in the shape you want and put the vinyl over top and when you pull the wire out it cuts the vinyl in whatever shape you put the tape down.
