2066088,0,t3_2ihxif,El taco de mexico best  dollar asada burrito. Corrales also worth mention. Their salsa is my favorite. I buy oz of it every few days and put it on everything. Feeds the hemorrhoids. Their ingredients taste fresher than taco de mexico and you pay the price. Get French fries in your burrito here.

4294479,0,t1_cs9lrnj,I have no idea what was wrong with my original post.This entire thread is full of people both politely and not so politely trying to tell you what it is thats wrong with your original post. In none of your responses do you seem to be even trying to understand what it is theyre trying to tell you instead you blow them off tell them to STFU call them names. No one is trying to pick on you here no one knows who you are. People are giving you feedback about what you wrote letting you know that the way you choose to communicate with other people may be affecting your ability to find a job and youre not trying to listen at all just saying that you have no idea what you did wrong and that people are chewing you up turning you into owl pellets. ,venturacounty,cs9pklu,6,t5_2rf5g

4522609,0,t3_3cyn2p,Im not here to bag on you but I have to ask have you visited somewhere you like more amp fits in more with your idea of a community?  If so why not live there?  But keep in mind you cant have it all.  If you want clean orderly neighborhoods with no homeless or any crime youre going to live in a community with absolutely no late night activities. If you want an urban environment with something happening  well you better get real ok with homelessness amp a lowered sense of safety amp security. P.s If you have found this mystical place that satisfies all your wishes please PM its locale. Id like to move there too!,venturacounty,ct0pr75,6,t5_2rf5g
4869851,0,t1_cu7sibr,But considering people are still moving here and enthusiastically buying real estate its hard for me to call it overpriced. My wife and I have rented for several years and we are getting ready to buy our first home in Ventura. I guess its all relative when you consider the term overpriced. When I compare what we can buy in Ventura compared to what the same money would buy in the San Fernando Valley where I lived for  years I am thrilled to find a home here. Better quality of life better traffic conditions. Better schools parks proximity to the beach. I commute an hour to LA every day and for me its still worth it to live in Ventura.,venturacounty,cu8drbz,2,t5_2rf5g

8312414,0,t3_4tdenl,As a trainer who has worked with a dog very similar to this one I cant take  her but I would love to offer my help to whoever you find to take her. Ill also keep an eye out for anyone who might be a good fit. To those considering her like OP said itll take a lot of patience and a good amount of time but she can be helped. The last dog I worked with took  solid months of consistent and slowly progressing training to get there but when she sat calmly on a park bench as people walked by and children played it was SO rewarding.,venturacounty,d5glx7n,3,t5_2rf5g

9256926,0,t3_57634n,Theres lots of IT jobs in LA specifically for networking. If you live in the Conejo Valley you may have to commute out of it to widen your options but just going to the Valley would open a lot of things up. Ixia is a big networking shop Im sure youve heard of it and located in Calabasas which is very close. If youre looking in the K range I would look in Agoura Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks. There should be a lot to choose from in that range and K will get you a good start there. All of the communities are really safe. Which certifications do you have? How much experience in networking do you have? With  years of experience in networking you should be looking at the K range. ,venturacounty,d8pdrgx,4,t5_2rf5g
