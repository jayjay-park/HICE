266662,0,t1_cf7twic,The comment in the forums was as quoted so youre not missing anything.The issue at the moment is that we get the choice of sidewinders with increasingly expensive weapons but no further mods.

428107,0,t1_cfp2lwp,Where has the assumption that the AI will not change and adapt? Of cours e it will. It already has several times. It happens because the programmers change something. It might not be realtime adaption but we will see changes and updates ongoing  especially when the major loopholes are uncovered in AI behaviour. Good example in the Alpha just now You can deliberately aggro NPC miners by flying through their mining beams. This has been fixed for the next patch.Having said all that this topic is about PvP rather than PvE. So its offtopic but to bring my own post back on topic there is actually quite a similarity between how humans learn from one another and how the Developers in Frontier tweak the AI. A few people will start to unearth the best tactics setups etc leading to FOTM. Then the Devs will programme it out through balance patches but it will take some time for FOTM to become FOTM until then its just an idea that someone has tested and found to work.  So in PvP it isnt AI that you have to contend with its balance. If you know something other players do not that makes you imba then you might as well be fighting against a poor AI for all the difference it makes to your level of difficulty and skill.,EliteDangerous,cfp4zz4,1,t5_2vi60

735589,0,t1_cgnmu05,In the case of TrackIR which is the headtracker I use you can configure how your real head movement maps to the movement of your virtual ingame head.  Its usually not a  ratio so that you only have to move your real head a little in order for your virtual head to move a lot more which enables you to for example look at the left edge of your monitor and see the ingame view behind you. It works well on a single screen setup but even better on triplescreens.All in all its easy to get used to and feels very natural when you use it and does nothing but add to the sense of immersion.  TrackIRs not cheap  but if you play flightracingspace sims then its worth it in my opinion.,EliteDangerous,cgnw2a3,2,t5_2vi60

You should do a little more research on what Star Citizen actually contains in its development pipeline before posting blanket statements like more ambitious than SC.

Federal combat bond is the easiest for new players right now. You will make money fastest here. Buy gimballed lasers as soon as you can afford them.The game often lags a lot if there are many players in the same area. Especially when a new player comes in speed can drop heavily mostly this lasts only for a minute until its up to normal again.But they update very frequently and a lot of problems where solved within a few days or weeks at most.

Mining was relaxing but obviously boring and Eve combat is like chess the game is won or lost usually before you even move a single piece without any actual physical skill all intellectual.  I know Braben has said something like there will be large logistical challenges in going far out into the depths of space I assume fuel and repair and consumables but I really am excited to watch the galaxy get pushed out and expanded as players move into new systems and hopefully Frontier assists by building stations in the new places players inhabit.

Is the fact that its beta clearly stated as well as any potential refund policy as refunds should be possible in most circumstances for most products as long as certain conditions are met according to EU law.On a related topic you can see why they wouldnt want to do it for the reasons stated above. Especially the sneak preview idea where people would buy it to check it out and then refund it once theyve had their fill. However that seems to be a problematic case for released products as well. The diablo III launch comes to mind with people who had put  hours in the game were asking for refunds. So there are definitely two sides to the issue.

Theres no kill assist reward currently so a player can do  hull damage to an enemy in a conflict zone and an NPC can snipe the kill at the last second giving the player no credit.

To start with try making your way to the nearest station on the galaxy map menu these have a space station icon super cruise over to it and dock. Once you have mastered the skill of travelling between systems and docking you can try some simple trading. What type of economy does your current destination have what is in high supply? Pick a destination on the starmap and figure out what to take basic example take agriculture items such as food to an industrial When you feel like earning some credits in battle head over to the Federation distress signal in Eranin and pick a faction using the right Functions panel again this is placeholder.

You go into the controls then map your yawrollpitch axis to the movement of the stick. Basically just like youd setup any other custom button.Im a little weird in that I dont use a lot of the joysticks buttons except the top buttons. I dont really use the side buttons. I use the HAT switch for system engine and weapons power with down on the hat resetting those defaults. I use the left button for targeting whats in front of me the right one for engine boots the top right one for flight assist onoff and.. heck I cant remember what I use the top left button for.  The rest I use the keyboard and mouse for. Of course I use the trigger for primary fire and the thumb button for secondary fire groups.Also I did setup the hat switch and two top buttons for moving through menus with the trigger acting as Enter to select. That works really well and I am happy with it.I have the Thrustmaster T stick too just got it yesterday but I am too used to the Logitech to really like it I think. It does feel somewhat more precise than the Logitech but honestly I dont think its enough to warrant keeping it. Its a really good joystick though. I think Im just too used tohappy with my Logitech to keep it!  Im going to try it out more later today and see though. The buttons on it are definitely cheaper feeling and overall it feels cheaper.

Any further directional thrust will change your vector accordingly.

1413084,0,t3_2a86d0,Audio great idea.  I always loved this about Eve.  In a game where you fill longish stretches of time flying to and fro having something to listen to without needing to alttab out is wonderful.  I found it quite relaxing to listen to the excellent Eve soundtrack along with my own choices as I flew about.  Ill probably end up listening to some Eve music as I play ED regardless its just appropriate to the game.Im not sure how a video player would work it would have to fit your video into the games little window and potentially transcode it while the game is running which could be quite a resource hog.  EDIT another possibility is the way GW handles this in that there is no dedicated UI music player but you can create folders inside the game folder with either playlists or files themselves under various headings these will play in a contextually appropriate manner.  Its very cool.  Having custom music for things like battles incities stations! when you are dead or in range or certain bodies to be ED specific would be very very fun.  Would you like to know more?,EliteDangerous,citeqlu,1,t5_2vi60
1416194,0,t3_2acq9w,I was able to beat it with ease the first night I played but I havent been able to beat it since. Im not sure whats changed since then but I think the reason I was able to beat it so easily that time is because the wave where you face  Federation fighters and a Sidewinder at the same time didnt have them all shooting at me at the same time for some reason.I dont know if the AI glitched out or what but ever since that time with all three ships shooting at me at the same time I just cant absorb that level of damage in a Sidewinder and the ship isnt maneuverable enough to dodge lasers and bullets if the AI decides to actually aim at you.The Anaconda was surprisingly easy to kill the first time I got that far.

1443319,0,t1_cix6yvt,Indeed they basically say that on the Cobra Engine marketinggtThis engine allows the game teams to develop and debug their games primarily on PC without the need to concern themselves with the technical details of the individual target platforms unless necessary.

1456730,0,t1_ciyuvgw,gt Sounds to me like a very clear implication that this is not to be expected in Star Citizen.Its not what Im being told about Star Citizen. Im being told by fans that the game is heavily story driven and that a big portion of what fans like of SC over ED is the single player campaign. I can only base my opinion on what Im being told... as I havent played the final game yet.Playing a single player campaign you are the protagonist in a set narrative. Still no misinformation there.gt  hand crafted systems are to compliment the procedurally generated ones that will be discoverable and nameable by the discovererWhere are you getting this from?

1470837,1,t1_cj0fzxm,Its only that way because of crowd funding... Theyre trying to sell more things so they get more revenue for the development of the game. Once the Persistent Universe is online they wont have a marketplace like they do now. Its just instead of buying a copy of just the game you can buy a pledge package which has a variety of different ships. You can spend  on the game or you could spend .

1492095,0,t3_2b913c,Im not sure what the TampC say but from a moral standpoint youre on shaky ground. If you can be sure its only to get a feel for the game thats one thing but giving a licence intended for you to another person means you have no control over how they use it.If they are a real life friend I wouldnt be too worried about letting them play whilst you are present. Hence you could potentially install the game on their machine and physically log them in taking care not to reveal your password. Then they can try it out  but you know that they wont log in without you present. However I personally would never give my password to anyone.,EliteDangerous,cj3b4mc,1,t5_2vi60

1545994,0,t3_2bxybk,The problem is lag its why there is a limit to how many people can be in one instance at a time. For the type of combat done in Elite and Star Citizen any lag you get would make the combat a bad experience its why its preferred that you get no lag at all for optimal experience. If you look at games such as EvE which Ive played for a long time we can get  players in a single system to duke it out. The problem with that is that there is massive lag modules take a long time to respond to your commands and typical battles of this magnitude can take up to  hours. But EvEs control scheme and the way game handles PvP its fine if there was massive lag. But in a game such as EliteSC where you actually control the ship like a plane lag is terrible for the experience and play. It be like many people rubber banding all over the place. While in a game like EvE its more of a you click the weapon it responds after x minutes and fires at the enemy basically combat like how they used to do it with muskets back in the day .Yeah it would be awesome if we could have fights of say  vs  or  vs  but with current networks its not really viable. Maybe in  years when the networks could handle such a thing. ,EliteDangerous,cja2bbg,5,t5_2vi60

Load up as much as you can safely haul i.e. can you afford to lose those fish and still have cash in the bank?If you are hauling you are not fighting.  Sell the Sideys weapons and anything else on it as that hinders jump range.  If you are interdicted flight assist off engine boost spin and wait for your hyper jump engine to ready itself again.  Once it does jump away.Do this until you have enough for a hauler PLUS A FULL LOAD OF CARGO then repeat same tactics.

1755191,0,t1_ck07ggd,I dont know much about game design but couldnt they just change a display color variable somewhere and have the color be whatever they want? Or let the player pick the color themselves and change it whenever they want? This doesnt strike me as something that should take longer than an hour. It would also be purely client side so theres literally no reason for the server to keep track of these things. ,EliteDangerous,ck0ee9c,1,t5_2vi60
1756490,0,t1_cjw05m9,Well we dont thats the point.  Some folks would like it that detailed and some think it can be done some think it flat out cant while some think if it can be done itll be boring.  Some folks would rather do it the way SC is doing it you have  or  hand crafted places you can land like MMO zones but much smaller probably and the rest of the planet is off limits.  I can see why that is crappy it breaks the immersion but no matter how you do it its a compromise I think.  Personally I try to play the ball where it lands whatever they end up doing Ill be fine with it since I think both have positives and minuses Im not gungho on one way or another so I wont be upset if they go with one method over another.,EliteDangerous,ck0ka7h,1,t5_2vi60

Just like the new Star Wars movie wont introduce a radically different XWing Elite will maintain the classics. The Cobra and the Asp are identifiable. The freighter designs are probably intentionally blocky  its supposed to be able to hold that cargo so it cant have a big hole in the middle or something. For wilder construction well probably need to wait until there are more light fighters or perhaps athmospheric fighters for stuff that has wingy bits.Imperial ships will probably have engines mounted on nacelles. And the imperial interdictor has the ringy bit. If the possible future Fed corvette is anything like the Impeccable it might have some space in the middle. The Fed cruiser has two hulls. Some Frontier First Encounters designs are also having more varied geometry that could be updated to become special designs.

Ive also bought a Cobra in the past and now when I go back to Chango Sometimes the Cobra loads into the same spot as my Viper glitch It makes it hard to launch cause they occupy the same spot and hit as I leave the pad. when I go into the shipyard both show X amount so is it that Im getting a deal on my Viper or is there a system in place for getting old ships back?,EliteDangerous,ckq5uk1,0,t5_2vi60

2035004,0,t1_ckyhf9t,Yeah but the Rift makes docking really easy IMO.  Its like OK Im just gonna fly through this slot.  Its actually one of the cooler things to do in Rift mode.  Pulling up to a station and lining yourself up with the slot while it wheels around in front of you filling your whole view then gliding forward through the gate before rolling your ship to align with the landing pad...way too much fun.  Only downside is that i have to lower my settings to get the framerate to stay at hz in stations.  Out in space I can run it at mostly high settings but in the stations I need to flip it to low.edit  this actually made me think...I wonder if there will be any other game mechanics other than space battles that require you to do more precise maneuvering.

What you just did was point out that there was exactly one activity in the game that carries any real risk at the moment and that only if youre actually buying your own cargo not accepting a mission that gives you a lot of cargo to ship which everyone is doing as far as I can tell right now. But one point of risk does not a meaningful environment make. Oh and two points of reward which at the moment seems to be either money or griefing lulz cause its beta.Eve has had a lot more time to develop the things that gave it its meaning but the fact that what you lost was lost was a part of it.

Just learn to deal with it. You can lower the picture quality to get more performance using the very last slider in the graphics options.

2092063,0,t3_2iv11s,Finding alien artifacts when exploring is certainly a possibility.  Im guessing it will start off with finding alien wreckage floating in space that we can salvage.  Later when we get planetary exploration we will probably find some things on planets as well at least if youre lucky as these things shouldnt be littered everywhere.  What i do hope however is that they retain their hard science approach when it comes to alien technology.  It shouldnt be possible to just find an item and reverse engineer it in a matter of minutes to make some alienhuman hybrid tech.  We cant even run a windows program on a mac unless its completely rebuilt so making some alien tech work with our human tech should be a very long term goal.,EliteDangerous,cl5qwyg,4,t5_2vi60

2110323,0,t1_cl7ggla,Yes Im aware of the DDF and the background simulation thread in the DDF Im a Kickstarter backer btw. These provide proposals for a basic system that simulates the base economy and government types of entities. According to Frontier A simulation entity is the lowest unit to which the simulation applies this will typically mean a system or a world within a system. While promising this is far from a vision which provides for simulated social actors in a deeper universe all with their own overlapping goals etc. Its more of a simulation of the government form GDP per capita and demographic indicators of nation states star systems in ED villages in our analogy and how these might change states according to various external stimuli.

You also dont want to waste your oxygen scooping fuel as you might need all the time you can get after an unexpected fight.Going for maximum fuel rate is also bad advice as that is a great way to get your heat rate way above .

Game expansions usually include additional levels for level based games and access to new areas where you can get things that provide a significant boost. A more concrete example  In WoW if you bought the vanilla game but never bought Burning Crusade then anyone who did could get  levels higher than you. I cant think of any multiplayer game off the top of my head that doesnt do something like that. The effect will be less in ED because there are no levels. Just equipment and skill.

Gaming evolved doesnt let me set a resolution by size unlike obs although it has the option to record at a max res of p which it is set to. so I assume that will be  x  which is what both my monitor and game are set to as well. I assume YouTube downscales it to x if you select to play in p. On my PC it always plays at p and I have to select p. Bit concerned it looks like lowest graphics settings. The game is configured to highultra. And with a bit rate of Mbs that should show in the recording. Well I would hope!

The player cannot help to createend wars can do nothing to influence the war can endlessly destroy capitol ships since they randomly spawn and arent persistent wars are really nothing meaningful other than prescripted events in Unidentified Source Signals and player actions have no impact on the persistent world whatsoever.  Ugh Ive been playing since Alpha and have really held faith in Frontier... but if this is really it it  feels like a halfcompleted game from the s. Really disappointed at the surprises in Gamma.

2428533,0,t1_cmbv68g,We have no proof that its there. So theres no reason to even suggest that its there. For all we know they figured they can go a couple of weeks before having to deploy it on the server and could be implementing it after release. There could have been a small dynamic test in any of the beta but there wasnt. There could have been a small one in the gamma but there isnt.  If they had it in all probability following good development practice and models they would have tried testing it.    With knowledge of software development and development best practice at best an educated guess is that its not present and or ready. There is also no evidence to suggest it exist.    Proposing that it exists is tantamount to saying that theres a teapot implemented in the game in the sol system orbiting the sun somewhere between the Earth and Mars and that it exist because you didnt prove you havent found it.,EliteDangerous,cmbvgp6,2,t5_2vi60

2429578,0,t3_2nb3oe,For what is currently available in gamma thats a decent description. The whole story line and events driven by the background simulation to give all of this context will start with release. This game will evolve and be actively supported by the developer past release and it appears to be starting from the same roots that EVE had based on accounts from EVE players that were around then. If you want to be part of growing a game like that get in. If you want to wait and see then do so but dont judge the game and write it off in a prerelease state or even the first month of it being out.  There will be fighting capital ships after release and social tools should improve. There will be a story through in game events starting on release. The first of which will likely be the Eranin war which I think will be a powder keg that kicks the intergalactic cold war into a real war.,EliteDangerous,cmc040y,2,t5_2vi60

Regardless the scenario is confusing enough even without that point. Its still going to look like a bug to every new player. The fact that its been ticketed probably dozens of times now by people whove been playing for months should tell Frontier something about their UI in this case.And just to be clear Im not asking for this to be dumbed down.

2436212,0,t1_cmcriqj,Its not just players doing the supply running. NPCs would be doing the bulk of it. But players being smarter and more well rounded would influence it in all sorts of ways from actual trade routes to piracy.And yes faction warfare plays a part as well. Unfortunately even X fails there without mods. The ships themselves dont need to be constructed in those games so its really only their loadouts that are affected. But you could make a faction pretty much broke and unable to get guns and shields so they are just free kills.Id rather see it go all the way in ED with the whole range of supply economy ships etc like you could get with modding X but with the way better systems graphics sounds and feeling of flight of Elite. And I am not even thinking about the other stuff Elite has yet to make in expansions which if all done right would make this the most epic space game ever.,EliteDangerous,cmctl4t,4,t5_2vi60

2438572,0,t3_2nf9jd,New Player Guide Yes right now the game is flat. The story is on pause until release and they took out warzones for an unknown reason. Usually new players would go to a warzone to get money and experience but you cant really do that right now.Besides that I see a couple of misconceptions on your post that frontier should address for final release so new players know what to do.Mining You cant just go to any old system and hope to make a profit. Thats like me going to the nearest hill with a pickaxe and expecting to find gold. Prospecting is important. Look at the system map each system has a set level of mining reserves and in order of abundance they go Pristine Major Common Depleted. Each belt Around a star or ring Around a planet has a set composition and from the best to worstMetallic Metal Rich rocky icy. Find a pristine metallic ring and youll be making at least  credits an hour in a hauler with the right techniques. Ive made  million in the last two days mining and I started with an eagle.Bounty Hunting You can make you Warrant scanner the same button as your main laser this will reduce the time you need for them to hold still. Also the warrant scanner is optional because once you see they are wanted you will get the bounty for the local system.Trading Some people like trading some dont there really isnt much else to say here. Currently because the warzone and bounty missions are screwed up its by far the best way to make money except mining which is more difficult.Missions Like I said before the galaxy is on pause until release so you wont really see great missions right now. Currently the game is like if Skyrim were in beta. The world is all there but there are no interesting PCs and the only quests available are of the Go into that dungeon and kill those Draugr variety.Exploring I Love exploring and have put up a few exploration tutorials on here. That said you have to be a huge science nerd to enjoy it. Finding a binary pair of earth like worlds in the Goldilocks zone of a blue star will only be exciting for a specific type of person its not fun for everyone.Thats what I like about this game.

One example would be if youre being pursued being able to flip around and fire on your attacker while maintaining evasive maneuvers away from him. Another would be if youre circling each other you can maintain that loop with your vert thrusters while bringing your weapons to bear on your target.Thats the biggest advantage youll get.

Here is an article from Intel describing a situation where HT can degrade performance. It basically boils down to bad code but the reality is that games arent always coded well coughACUcough.Anecdotally in my professional life Ive run into cases in the past year where disabling HT increased performance on some enterprise systems as well. Im too lazy to benchmark my gaming desktop because things run well enough but there are absolutely realworld cases where HT is detrimental. Even if HTs not detrimental in a given circumstance I find it hard to recommend an extra  toward something that has a negligible impact on games today. Its the same reason gamers arent running out and building xbased systems today  theres simply very few games that take advantage of so many cores regardless of whether theyre physical or logical.

2531459,0,t1_cmoygdr,I agree. Frontier really needs to improve on the tutorials and provide basic information as you point out.

2533075,0,t1_cmovmsq,My apologies for the vitriol but youre a fucking idiot.  gt It doesnt matter because the truth is if you care so much and buy the game at December th then youre in disadvantage to begin with. The reason is in ED you make money by having money and kickstarters or even preorders to some extent will have free ships that worth a few hundreds thousands credits. I posted this to someone else but just in case someone reads what you wrote and thinks that you actually have a point this should shed some truth on the matter If you havent bought the game yet having a wipe or not doesnt affect you in the slightest because this game is not about Lolz lemme get the best ship with the most money and the most rep in all teh syztemz! because that is not a feasible goal. For instance look at the cost of ships    Sidewinder Mk. I   CR    Eagle Mk. II   CR    Zorgon Peterson Hauler   CR    Viper Mk. III   CR    Cobra Mk. III   CR    Lakon Type Transporter   CR    Asp   CR    Imperial Clipper   CR    Federal Dropship   CR    Orca   CR    Lakon Type Heavy   CR    Anaconda   CRWinging it on the back of my napkin a free Eagle is .  the cost of an Anaconda a Cobra is .  of an Anaconda. But youre not whining about what we get as backers  youre whining about our ability to collect credits prior to December th. Well you should know how easy it is to earn credits. If not Ill explain it to youStarting in a Sidewinder with  cargo slots and  CR to your name you can pick up a few missions on the Bulletin that can pay between  credits just to go to another nearby system and deliver a message. Or you can do missions from the Bulletin that ask you to haul cargo that THEY provide to another system which is also typically near to where youre getting it and you earn a decent amount of credits on that also. Assuming your starting station provides you with at least  mission to start with you should easily be able to make  credits in an hour of just running basic Bulletin missions that ask you stop off at nearby stations to deliver stuff. On top of this on your way to each station you can take a quick moment to look at the Commodity Market and find High Supply items that have a BUY price that is LOWER than the Galactic Average and click the dropdown to verify that it says EXPORTED TO for the system that youre heading to. Doing this to fill up your cargo bay assuming its not already full from delivery missions can earn you  CR or more in your first hour. THE FIRST HOUR! It gets exponentially better from there because you can either upgrade your cargo bay or just save your cash for a ship with the nextlargest bay.The point of all this?  Whatever discrepancy that exists between a backer and nonbackers credit balance is a moot point as once they spend a few hours getting used to the game they will be able to efficiently make credits after learning the game and there is no end goal to race towards.  There are tons of resources out there explaining how to do so and there are also videos explaining how its done.  ,EliteDangerous,cmp7jj7,0,t5_2vi60

2542153,0,t1_cmq2yx6,Your looking at  mil per A grade plant shield and FSD. You need  at least class  A grade shield bank k and from memory its  mil for reinforced and  mil for mil spec bulkheads. Just go with shields shield bank and fsd then trade till you have enough for the others. You hardly take damage when timjng your banks corectly and with  class  burst gimablled and  class  cannons gimbled you can take pretty much anything npc that interdict including anaconda.  Fully laden you have  ly jump. Enough to do the rare trade run in  jumps with  cargo. Edit If you want for war only then once you have all funds you need last thing would be to sell the class  cargo and sell your Class  shield... Swap them around have a class  shield and  ton cargo or drop cargo all together...

2548045,0,t3_2ow70s,Hey Commander. Posted this yesterday on a related thread. Updated it with a list.  Sidewinder  Federal Fighter  Sidewinder  Federal Fighters Cobra Mk  Eagle Sidewinder and  Federal Fighters Viper Sidewinders  Anaconda Tips Stay close to your attackers. If you get in a joust most of the enemies will rip you to shreds. If they get out beyond  km its most likely going to mean a restart so stay close. To facilitate such closequarters fighting youre going to want to have three pips in your engines at all times and dont be shy with the afterburner. The only thing that the Sidewinder has going for it is maneuverability.  Pips in engines and the rest in shields. When youre in a good position to fire switch over the pips to your weapons fire. Once youre done firing immediately put the pips back to shields. Live to fight another wave. Dont fire the cannon until the fifth wave the Cobra. Trust me ammo becomes really scarce and youll be thankful you were frugal. Coincidentally dont fire the cannon until your targets shields are down and youre sure youll hit. Discipline commander. The Federal Fighters are very weak. They shoot a lot but dont let it get to you. If you put three pips in shields they wont even really make it through. When you turn to catch up with a bogie try do to so in a pitch yaxis you can move a bit faster than yawing. Also temporarily disable your Flight Assist and use your thrusters. If youre not comfortable with FAoff slow down and make sure your speed is in the blue sweet spot. Finally the last level is I now believe a test of patience and not of piloting skill. By the time you get to the Anaconda youre probably a little beat up and running low on ammo. Remember the Supply Strike mission where you had missiles? Yeah not here. The only way to handle the ship is to fly backwards at . km and slowly glacially pick off its shields with your laser firing whatever bullets you can into its hull. In the full game youd never take on say three Sidewinders alone with a stock Sidewinder and bad weapons after eight other waves of rough fighting. Incursion isnt meant to prep you for regular combat its meant to push your limits forcing you to either give it your all or give up.And check out uSnakeyesX playthough its good. ,EliteDangerous,cmr604z,2,t5_2vi60

If you play it with the goal of endgame biggest ship baddest weapons I dont see it being fun.  I love love love the game and have been in since beta opened must have a couple hundred hours.  You get to create whatever story you want but it requires some imagination Ill admit. Its not a narrative driven game they leave it up to you.  Not many games do this.  I left my starter system explored locally running cargo missions. I eventually could afford a fsd interdictor.  I then went around hunting and collecting the bounties I havent gotten tired of the combat yet.I came across a system with a major reserve metallic ring and a good amount of stations both federal and independent. I decided to make it my home at elate for now.  I sold my fsd interdictor bought a refinery and mining laser. Sold my shield gen and added extra cargo racks.  I spent a few days worth of gaming just mining in my sidewinder.  The metallic rings held a lot of gold  palladium and platinum. I got chased out by hostiles a few times but amassed a lot of money quickly.Next I started to wonder about trying to help factions with my home system.  I chose to align with the station I have been selling my metals to. Now Im currently in the middle of gaining a good rep with the locals and have done a few missions tonight in a cobra.  Maybe later Ill pick up a viper and do some serious bounty hunting who knows! My plan after establishing my rep is to strip down the cobra buy the biggest fsd I can find and explore explore.Im an unknown commander who made a small fortune mining and now Im ready to make my name known in my home system soon I will have power to go with the wealth. I will only hunt the wanted but in an anarchic system I will shoot first. I smuggle illegal drugs because I think the people need access to them. I defend other player commanders from hostiles.That is my story and I want to keep playing to see where it takes me.  Im not thinking of the ships as a goal Im deciding as a commander what I want to do and choosing my ship appropriately. And having a hell of  a time! I will be playing this for hundreds more hours.

Basically doing the moonwalk.  Then the Sidey hits boost and rockets off straight up from the original angle of flight...

Then angle out of the orbital plane untill your acceleration levels off or youre halfway to the destination.

They are criticizing YOU for liking the product as if it was YOUR personal failing to recognize the downfalls of that product. So you get defensive angry and vitriolic in order to protect your ego and your protect your emotional investment. Its immaturity because its just a fucking product and with a little bit of thought and reason you can realize pretty quickly how absurd it is to get upset over something like that. Or realize how someone remarking on said product has absolutely nothing to do with your decision to support or like it.

2641705,0,t1_cn32g64,Im so emotionally confused right now! You start off making your point using works from Dr Harold white which is cheating. That guy is my hero. Then you turn around and dis kerbal space program!I see what youre saying. I really do. As I said I think you and I are the same. I would LOVE for a game such as the one youre wishing for. But we are so freaking rare man. If frontier made this game like what you want they wouldnt make money. This isnt their fault and unfortunately is way out of their hands. Have you not noticed the trend on believability in games? First person shooters like flash point and arma never get crazy popular because of how hard they are. You get shot once and the game is basically over. Hell! Even eve online which for the longest time never once bent to the lowest common denominator instead opting to make the tutorials better... Until They get rid of the clone mechanic which was the best way to force responsible gaming and continue with its dying sucks theme.We are hinting at a problem that is larger than any game. We are growing old in a world that is losing interest in realism and puts anything truly inspiring in the dirt. Media is case and point. The media used to be held to a standard of getting facts right first then publishing. Now they rush first hearsay to the tv and when they get things wrong shrug their shoulders and move on. Where is the news about Dr Harold White? Why do they not give Elon Musk credit for what he is REALLY TRYING to do? Where in the GOD DAMN HELL is the excitement over the space industry? NASA finally has a capable space craft that can carry man into space once again and its just popped on the news next to Lillys bakery shop extravaganza!Games are not going to be that thing that inspires because if a game is too hard read that realistic then people go elsewhere. The only people left behind are those like us. If you think realism could have triumphed then games such as Orbiter would be popular. So I dont know the answer to your concern. I wish I did Id be in the copilot seat right there with you. Dont blame frontier for trying to survive in a world that forces him to make games like this. If you got barben drunk and hard pressed him on the issue Im willing to bet he would admit that he feels dirty having to make a game that is so arcadish.,EliteDangerous,cn3eiys,2,t5_2vi60

Go there and use your Basic Discovery Scanner if theres anything near the star it will show up then you need to go scan everything. Anything beyond that youll have to find with your eyeballs pIt can be a pain to find stuff the scanner doesnt pick upneed advanced scanner to see everything immediately. Avoid scanning ice looking planets they arent worth the time really.As for bounties. Go to a Nav Beacon or Resource Extraction Site or drop into an Unidentified Signal Source. Target ships and let the scanner do its work. If they come up as Wanted blast em. Kill Warrant Scanner can be good if youre just hunting Wanted people.

2671615,0,t3_2qlt5m,The neat thing about expansionbased games is that you get a fairly reliable revenue stream from the existing player base and from new folks you draw in over time. Its not going to make WoW levels of cash but itll do alright.The really neat thing about ED is that its self published by Frontier a company of only some  or so employees and as such any revenue derived from it is kept inhouse. Frontier also does game and software development for other publishers. Its not like ED is their only revenue stream and the technology they developed and will continue to develop for ED can be licensed in both their contract work or to other developers as a product making ED a valuable tool even just as a demonstration platform for their portfolio. Maybe one day itll all come crashing down but the serverside of things actually seems relatively light compared to other games. Most of it is matchmaking and persistent storage but the meat of the network operations the game uses are peer to peer. Thats why everything is an instance and you have the  player per instance caps. Launch went smoothly which proves what theyre doing works and with the model theyve implemented I cant imagine their hostingoperations needs are astronomical. Hell I think I read somewhere that theyre using EC for the game servers.So maintenance and operations costs are pretty minimal and given that Frontier isnt a one trick pony it seems pretty reasonable that they can sustain the game in its current state pretty much indefinitely with revenue from other projects and its worthwhile to do so. As far as expansion development goes well its like any other game development cycle isnt it? You pitch internally and set budgets you either fund it all inhouse with current assets or revenue from other projects andor you accept outside investment if absolutely necessary. Then you sell the product and hopefully make a bunch of money even if not all of it comes from direct consumers but also secondary sources like licensing and professional services.TLDR Frontier and ED dont exist in a bubble and its a bit silly to be worried about the longevity of the product as though they do. Its far too early and the game has been too well received to warrant handwringing just yet.,EliteDangerous,cn7awwo,2,t5_2vi60

How about pretending I have rich star parents and buying a nice big ship to haul more goods to make more money..? Im guessing the answer there is no. We have to start out as little ships and make good to get the bigger ships. I get it. But holy jeezers there really isnt any training wheels in this game is there? Q How about this is there any guide to beginner trading like tips on starting out? I just found slopeys market tool and this promises to be helpful. ,EliteDangerous,cn8ebe9,1,t5_2vi60

Besides the precise control and accurate centering one of the biggest advantages is having all the critical functions mapped to keys on the throttle and stick no more looking down at the keyboard to pick out a critical key and losing visual awareness of the combat.

It is indeed a very interesting idea to pump shield cells and engage ramming speed however!I will not say you are incorrect sir pirate but I will say that the weapons on my ship are naught but chaff to confuse your targeting systems and shield batteries to refill what little power I have while biding time to return to the safety of speed. I will also say that while I may indeed be making money hand over fist I take only what a station is willing to give me at first blush and do still have to journey quite the distance in order to make my credits.One day I will indeed return to the realm of combat.

The stock Viper isnt that great of a ship tbh and upgrades are expensive. Class  gimballed multicannons alone are k a pop so do keep that in mind before you buy a Viper. You need to have a bit of cash to get it going.EDIT One thing to note is that the Eagle is squishy.

I wouldnt want that to change Solo should always be there when you dont have a stable net connection. Which is the same reason why I dont think Solo should be by default less dangerous.Like you I dont want to force anyone to play a mode they dont like. Thats part of why I feel Solo should not be the easy option.

We dont really want a tried and true method of doing anything just a number of things that seem to work better than others. More variety more challenge.Ive found that what works for me is to drop out close so I let the station get in the mid  kms full speed towards the front of the station get the docking request as soon as I am within range and never slow down. Watch the radar and avoid any moving traffic because theyre probably cops. If I get a scan warning I cut on silent running and continue to move. The combo of those two is much better than either one alone. I dont think the cops cheat because I havent ever been scanned and gotten a fine if I hit the silent running right then thank you Voice Attack.,EliteDangerous,cnnvy7t,1,t5_2vi60

I actually saw the ship each time realised where it was going then misjudged when to pull my finger off the trigger.As Ive said numerous other times on this topic I dont see how it can be any other way without unacceptably granting an advantage to any unexpected attacker.As it stands you have a natural advantage by firing first. But if they implement a fix for this nonissue then theyre essentially giving the attacker free shots before a bounty is assigned.And what of people firing highdamage weapons? Surely if its not your fault with a MC its not your fault with a torpedo either. So if you have some sort of first shot doesnt count system its much too exploitable. You could conceivably knock out someones shields with your first shot  and your target at that point still cannot fire back until your second shot.

The other reason is that supercruise is ridiculously fast... it takes that much time just to slow your ship down.You can use some tricks like aiming for the planet first to slow yourself down faster instead of gradually but theres no way to just fly up to a station and drop out of cruise quickly.Side Note  This approach to  the station is where Pirates really get Cargo Haulers at a disadvantage.

2881330,0,t3_2t4b8r,Most of his points have a grain of truth in them but he exaggerates to the point that they are actually untrue. The game has some bugs. I encounter one or two a week and some encounter a few more. Rarely are they game breaking. Half the time you dont even notice them until someone points them out to you. The offline solo mode requires Internet connection to sync the galaxy state trading faction states war zones game saves to the player and back. I do not consider this a game breaker at all and is probably stores alt of cheating too. Braben wanted true offline but the scale of the game meant he had to give up on it but it upset some thin skinned selfrighteous people. They think there is some legal basis for delivering exactly what was hoped for at Kickstarter which isnt the case. You cant pause without saving and quitting to the main menu. You restart almost exactly where you left off. The background simulation cant be paused so a frozen ship even in single player doesnt really work. It isnt an MMO and whilst in game comms have been patchy they are getting better. There was a backlog of support tickets. There still is. The havent deleted them all although the tickets from Beta an older system have been removed. The support staff seem to be working through the tickets and attempting to deal with critical stuff first before sorting out minor issues that the player should probably have solved for themselves. There was a period when any problem not know how to play dying through negligence etc was encouraged to be ticketed and that hasnt helped. But its getting better. The servers are currently offline for  minutes every UK morning. Presumably as part of the bug hunting and fixing process. Im sure its annoying it thats pm in your timezone but people seem to want the bugs eradicated. Cant have your cake... Otherwise the servers have been very stable. Ive had one  minute disconnect and Ive only heard of about half a dozen which isnt bad for a newly released online game. Some of the Kickstarter gifts havent been delivered and the angstridden explayers are having a little cry about that too. Some of the less intelligent ones have even tried to start legal action that will be laughed out of court. Theyll deliver. Why wouldnt they its not as though nobody had heard of them. So there are issues. But most are very minor. Some are mildly annoying. And only a few people out of thousands upon thousands of players have anything game breaking that isnt down to having a computer full of viruses and very old drivers etc. ,EliteDangerous,cnvlyii,5,t5_2vi60

2904383,0,t3_2sn50o,Why is the supercruise deceleration dependant on whether you are locked to a target or not? When i try to decelerate from say c to  kms in deep space and with no target selected the process takes a few seconds. Same with accelerating from  kms to c.If I select a target the game tries to second guess my speed by changing the scale of the speedometer and creating this blue zone in it. What this does is reduce my ships deceleration ability. The ship basically becomes sluggish as hell to control whenever you have something targetted.Ive read many people mistakenly think this is because of the increased gravitational field  which is often found near targets if you target planets or space stations etc.. But even if you just target one lone canister in space as an unidentified signal source this limiting of deceleration happens.This makes me want to just do all travelling manually without targetting anything but the UI of the game does not make this very easy unless Ive misunderstood something. Is it possible to untarget something without targetting something else?,EliteDangerous,cny8fuj,1,t5_2vi60

2919861,0,t1_cnzzcgp,The monorail vs hover buses was an example of an infrastructure decision.  A bit like in Master of Orion and that sort of game where whatever you build hydroponics vs missile bases has an effect on the local economy.  You are correct that those effects would then flow on through the economy and be reflected in the market.  And good management would be reflected with higher immigration.What makes the long term games interesting is that they take the standard double choice guns vs butter and turn it into a triangle guns vs butter vs tech but of course ultimately tech is just about getting better guns and better butter.I dont know if people have the attention span for a long term real time game though.  If it takes three years to build and staff your space university and another five years for it to have a  uptick on the local economy who is going to wait around for that?And that was ultimately the point that having political power is an option but its not necessarily an interesting one similarly to how bounty hunting is or rather should be more exciting than mining.,EliteDangerous,cnzzwnd,1,t5_2vi60

In games where your weapons are gimballed and you control their aim directly with the MouseFreelancer Darstar One and Star Citizen if you are using gimballed weapons mouse an keyboard generally work very well as the indicator which shows in which direction you are turning doubles as your crosshair and you only have to focus on one point of the screen to know where you are flying and what you are aiming at.In games however where you have a separate indicator for where your mouse is and what you are aimingED Star Citizen if you only have fixed weapons at it can become pretty hard as you have to concentrate on two different point on the screen crosshair and mouse indicator.Star Citizen has kind of fixed this issue since they use lag pipes as you can guess from the lag pipes position what direction you are flying.e.g. you lag pipes lags to the left meaning you are flying to the right.This however isnt a solution for elite as elite has lagless weapons such as lasers.Joysticks dont have this problem since you have physical feedback of having the stick in your hand to know where you a flying.Another issue Elite has with mouse and keyboard is that the follow the cursor input method is more suitable for pitchyaw then pitchroll.That said Elite has absolutely superb Joystick controls and anyone seriously interested in the game should really consider getting a Joystick because no matter what Joysticks will always be more immersive for Elite than a Mouse ever could be.

For a circular orbit both of the focus points merges as the center and the semimajor axis becomes the radius. For quick calculations it is somewhat reliable to consider all orbits to be circulars. To be more precise you need more information eccentricity of the orbits i.e. how elongated it is relative position of the orbits is their longest axes in the same direction?

2991901,0,t1_co7yqzf,Right first off lets be clear right?  EVE suffers from this problem because it is an OLD GAME and most of the features in EVE now were never envisaged in the original design document.  EVE is also a game that was designed for a niche market and grew very very slowly over the course of several years.  That means their server architecture could grow with it.That opening weekend on EVE?  You had better believe their launch was shocking.  The only thing that saved them was that their game was barely a game in the first place and that people felt they could just log off and not play when it was unplayable.Secondly you dont have a clue what you are talking about.  The absolute best model for a procedurally generated universe where player interactions are expected but short range is a PP model.  It is the model I would implement if I were designing the game.  Why?  Because youre talking about HUGE volumes of space.  People cross the fucking galaxy in this game mate.  Even if you had  million people playing it like World of Warcraft youre still not going to get more than a few hundred in a given system unless they are all grinding away like beavers and even then it is still best to instance them off.Do you think WoW handles having several hundred in the same zone particularly well?  What you are talking about is utter nonsense. gaming modes sharing the same simulation?  What does it matter?  If you have fifty people working to get a station up to a particular status you need fifty people working in the opposite direction.  The only way to coordinate  people is to get this socialize with other players.  So what youre talking about is utterly ridiculous.  The only effect of this is to simulate the so called living economy that other games like X and even as far back as I War  did mainly by random number generation.There has never been any game which could prevent you from acting as Commander Space Pirate Saviour of Space.Then we get this comedy goldgt Worse. This isnt a coding issue this is done. Not changeable. At least with FDs resources which are dwindling. Checked out their stocks lately? The players arent the only ones starting to wake up.Lets be clear here.  Ive seen this same sentence written about something like  games now ranging from Firaxis titles to Blizzard titles.  Its been written by hundreds of people all of which are armchair game designers with no real grasp of what the hell they are doing thinking because they can play something they understand it.Never once have I been illuminated by people like yourself.  They are always people who go schizophrenically from posting like mad in forums related to what they are talking about through to trying to shit on other peoples fun or posting stupid systemically inaccurate crap like you just did.  People with no real understand of what it takes to produce a game what it takes to code one from scratch or the kind of infrastructure you need to put in place to support a server based game.  Worse the kind of infrastructure you need to track AI pilots across an entire galaxy.All people like yourselves ever do is shit up forums for people like myself  who mainly just want to socialize with other players of the same game on those few free moments we actually get in our lives.  Instead we have to read through your technically nave verbal sewage.Just give it the fuck up man.  If you dont like the game stop bloody posting here.  I couldnt give a crap.  I will drift in and out of this game as they add new features and as they make the game more interesting and more engaging but I will never ever pretend I understand more about the design of this game than its own bloody designers.,EliteDangerous,co83wsb,2,t5_2vi60
2992601,0,t3_2ugc96,Its not a bad idea and has been talked about quite a bit but its got too much potential to become a griefing mechanism. Lots of players are very wealthy and a  or even  million credit bounty would be a poultry sum of money to stick on someones head for something as trivial as a difference of opinion here on reddit. The players need not have even made contact in game. Even if some small time pirate legitimately hassled me in game in his CobraViperEagle or whatever I could take the immensely disproportionate response of dropping a  million credit bounty on his head and totally ruin him. He might not have the means to pay it he would be hounded by players and NPCs alike until his inevitable destruction he wouldnt be able to go anywhere near civilised space and would ultimately be forced to declare bankruptcy and start again in a little sidewinder.

3144749,0,t3_2w50on,Trading is by far the most profitable profession as things stand.First trade rares. When you can get a ship over T cargo follow these tips..First find a good Hitech station no more than ls from the jump beacon selling high value items cheaply consumer tech progenitor cells performance enhancers etc also with a high demand for valuable metals gold palladium etc.Now look for an extractionrefinery system close by. Industrial and agricultural systems tend not to have anything of any value to sell back to your high tech station so I ignore those. Tip in the galaxy map limit the trade routes only to valuable metals and the high value items you are carrying to find your potential customersNote When I say extractionrefinery I am referring to a system with a combined extractionrefinery station not extraction OR refinery.Start fanning out from the Hitech system to all the extractionrefinery systems with maybe a dozen of each of you potential selling items in your hold. You are looking for one with a high supply of valuable metals and a high demand for one of the items in your hold. Preferably it will also be close to the jump beacon. Sell them a single example of each of the items you are carrying. You are looking for anything with at least a k per tonne profit. .Aim to travel no more than  systems to find your extractionrefinery station. If you cant find one move to another hitech system are repeat from step My goal here is to find a two way trade route averaging at least .k per tone and taking no more than  mins there and back. I have found a few of these so far and they tend to be almost inexhaustible because the numbers of products are so high. The added advantage is that because they have not been discovered by a crowd sourcing trade tool they arent flooded with pilots. ,EliteDangerous,cony7wb,2,t5_2vi60

3155399,0,t1_cooyib0,The reason that it works well for trolls e.g. on forums such as reddit is because if you just deny them access theyll go off and make another account in an instant.  Whereas a shadowban is like a timeout.  Trolling is typically attention seeking behaviour and if nobody is reacting then the miscreant will either escalate or stop but if noone can see the escalation then noone will react to that either.In terms of a game like ED youve sold them a product  a space sim.  Shadow banning them for violating TOS allows them to keep using the product they bought.

Or is it simply a case of ensuring that the camera is facing me?. Mac support. Currently I bootcamp to play Elite and its likely Ill keep doing so I have two computers on my desk.  Ill obviously do some research myself too but off hand do you know if the PS Eye is supported on OS X e.g. is it UVC? and is there accompanying tracking software for OS X too?  I assume the hat comes with a driver is there a driver for OS X?. Returns. What is your policy? Obviously I wouldnt expect you to take returns simply because I dont like it and I would expect returns if the device is faulty  but what if I simply cant get it to work on my computer for some reason?

For a completely irrelevant comparison by your count George Lucas has  awards and  nomination This includes  academy award and  academy award nominations.gt because while building a memorial to Lucas means elevating his masterpieces it also means remembering the flopsThats one way to look at it.I have few opinions on art but this sort of overlaps If you are going to accomplish something great you cant be afraid of failure. So when you say that a memorial for George Lucas is bittersweet due to his failures  I again disagree. I dont see it as a bad thing that he doesnt have a perfect track record.That said I didnt like the prequels either.gt I stand by the sentiment that almost every constructive activity humans do is art in some way or other.Well then Id argue that creating what is arguably the most popular movie franchise and fictional universe in human history is a decent contribution to art.,EliteDangerous,cozito8,1,t5_2vi60

If other players are trading heavily in that particular system or trying to curry favour with a particular faction when its in a preferable boom state they show up.Similarly when they do arrive other players can trade with them buying local resources and quickly tip it into a bust state so you only have a relatively short time window to exploit them.Its happened to me on more than one occasion where Ive found a Seeking Luxuries convoy made a few trades and called it a night only to login the next day and theyre gone.,EliteDangerous,cp2slgo,1,t5_2vi60

Given enough time in World of Tanks everyone would have a Tier  heavy.  Given enough time in World of Warcraft everyone will be level .  Following your argument since its going to happen eventually the experience needed for a T heavy or a level  character should be reduced in those games as well so that everyone can get there faster.The FDL should be hard to get whether it is the best ship in the game or not.  It is a luxury item.  It looks awesome and yes you should pay through the nose to have an awesome looking ship just like in the real world you pay through the nose for a Porsche.  Im OK with that.  Heres my checklist.  Am I having fun playing?  Yes..  Does the cost of the FDL make me have less fun while playing?  No..  Will I eventually own an FDL?  Maybe.The game isnt going to get more fun for me by lowering the price of the FDL.  It will get more fun by adding more ships content features and things to do.  Im in no rush to race to the endgame content.  If we take the high cost of the FDL in context with all the new cool things that came out in .?

3378456,0,t1_cpda2vo,One small correction to your excellent guide  The Sguiggly Bar Above Fuel is not your fuel use.  It is your heat signature and dictates how visible you are on the scanner.  Use of supercruise weapons or excessive thruster use increases your signature.  Shutting down unnecessary modules and using nonthermic weapons reduce your signature.  Turning on silent running eliminates your signature but heat will not be vented into space and instead build up inside your hull requiring you to either deactivate silent running or eject a heat sink.,EliteDangerous,cpddb4j,1,t5_2vi60

Dedicated combat ship. If you are like me using gimballed pulse lasers is a good match for this ship because they are low power hit hard keep firing for ages and let you keep on target while manuevering. I think it is very balanced for the price. It sucks at everything that isnt combat so it should be better than all the multirole ships at that price range Asp at combat.

In testing I found no noticeable difference in DPS between gimballed and fixed beam lasers.

With Bursts you still have the wonder affect but you deliver your damage over a much shorter period allowing you to pick the moment when to do the damage more precisely.

In other words for C pulses there is no such thing as a better fixed or gimbaled or turreted pulse laser  the only options are the mounting type. There is no C A gimbaled pulse laser for sale somewhere. The only time weapons increase in rank is as they get larger. The reason for this is a little odd compared to other games. A C E weapon does as much base damage as a C E weapon of the same type. There is no difference in damage as you increase in size. That sounds weird until you consider that where damage does change is in the enemy you fight. A small weapon C does reduced damage to a large enemy. However there is some rank increase as you get into larger and larger weapons so you do see some increased base damage from that.

They are the lightest weight system and have very low power use. Use them on Life support Sensors and any other system not vital to your build. Total weight also makes a big difference to maneuverability.Power management On the Right screen gt modules turn the priority of Cargo Hatch FSD drive down to a lower higher number. Total the percentage. This lets you go OVER deployed power on your load out by the same percentage. Give it a try you will figure it out. Its a necessary skill on the Power hungry Viper.gtShould I be gunning for a different ship for Pvp combat? Like the Fer de lance or something?Viper is the early combat ship of choice period. Cobra is slightly faster boost and bigger cargo hold if you pirate slight weaker shields tho. Vulture seems to have a speed issue but others disagree. Imperial Clipper and FdL are the end game badass PvP hunting ships.PvP the key is dropping shields fast before shield cells can kick in. You want sudden burst damage. Check out Railguns. Hard to use but incredible shield amp hull damage in sudden bursts.gt Do I need to have flight assist off to be a better pilot?No. But you do need to use it some.Learn a few brief tricks you can do with temp FA off and incorporate them into your routine.

Boost with FA off straight  maintains your top speed longer Try Boost last . sec of the boost FA off yank back pitch at the perfect time takes practice listen for boost cut off sound If done right you can  much faster.

Yes there were those who chose both but I didnt see an inherent  increase in Feds or CSG switching.    Capital ships This is the major reason that I wrote my response. Remember that we didnt have capital ships on hand for the majority of the combat. You guys delayed them trade goals was the reasoning if IRC.

3500153,0,t1_cpqqwbg,Yeah I think the best analogy someone made in the forums was to imagine your shield as a piece of wrapping paper. The size of the shield gen determines the size of the paper. So if you have cm square piece of paper then this can wrap a matchbox viper several times over but the same amount of paper would only just be able to wrap up a hefty book clipper.  Once the paper gets too small then you cant wrap the book at all hence why bigger ships cant use smaller shield gens. There is some discrepancy once you look at say anacondas but its a reasonable rule of thumb to use. ,EliteDangerous,cpr8qmn,1,t5_2vi60

In an interview with Rockpapershotgun Braben had this to say about expansions and balancing it out between players that have the expansions and dont have the expansions. And expansions are different from DLC by the way. Expansions are meant to flesh out the game in a huge way with new mechanis. Downloadable content does just that adds content to the existing game but without any new ways to expirience it.gt Braben So weve done two updates with new features already and theyre free which means everyone gets them. So that doesnt divide the community. When a paid update comes for example that allows going down to planet surfaces it would be great if people did that. Because weve got to keep funding the development which is what hope people will do but they dont have to do that and you may find a group of friends will eventually do it. In the same way Call of Duty fans will eventually move to the later version of Call of Duty. If you think of Call of Duty doing a paid update as being the next version of the game you have to buy the whole thing or you cant play.He explains it perfectly.

3568902,0,t1_cpysnoz,I feel the same way. But then again this really isnt FDs fault. Size is relative and without getting right up next to something theres no easy way to tell from just looking how large a planet moon or star really is.Idk maybe there is something they can do with textures to convey a better sense of scale. I known that one of the things that grinds my gears is that most of the textures are recycled and reused so much that all of the stars and planets get repetitive very quickly. But that is another topic for another day.Maybe if they added space stations to some of the more massive planetsstars the sense of scale would become more apparent. Or putting planets close to giant stars and moons close to giant planets. Just something so that we could see how tiny they look in comparison.Once they include atmospheric flight I think the scale of planets will become much more obvious. And annoying lol everyone is going to avoid the giant planets because itll seem like it takes forever to get through the atmosphere.,EliteDangerous,cpz2yom,1,t5_2vi60

3573829,0,t3_319gtr, If you see people in the forums talking about Conflict ZonesPiracyBounty Hunting in disputed systems  think twice before going there alone at least these are essentially the endgame areas intended for CMDRs with wellequipped ships.  Nav Beacons Resource Extraction Sites and Unidentified Signal Sources are good places to grind bounties if youre a newer player.  If your friends are onlineWing up with them! Even if youre just trading youll get a kickback whenever they make sales. If youre making a long trip where you would have to refuel on the way either bring a fuel scoop or make sure that you keep track of which systems are inhabited so you dont get stranded between remote systems. Consider turning off Report Crimes Against Me in the  panel  otherwise if your buddy accidentally grazes you with their fire the security ships and NPCs and other CMDRs will treat them as hostile. When in Anarchy Systems bounties will not be displayed by the initial scan equip the Kill Warrant Scanner and use it to reveal their bounties. KW Scanner can also be used to reveal additional bounties on pilots that already show up as wanted in the system you are in. Take on missions at multiple stations to get System Permits so long as the local Factions that supply the particular missions are allied with the major Faction that controls the restricted system.

The large hardpoints are wonderful and the shield strength is quite good. It has a relatively small generator though so its ability to mount shield cells and boosters is rather limited. Weapons that draw a lot of power can also be problematic. However even with just class pulse lasers itll just chew through anacondas and pythons,EliteDangerous,cq15b0o,1,t5_2vi60

Protons and Neutrons in the nucleus with a cloud of electrons orbiting right? Well after a star novas a couple different things happen depending on how massive the remnant is. If the remnant is less than . Solar masses you end up with a white dwarf. A white dwarf is the carbon coreliterally a white hot lump of charcoalthat didnt have enough mass to fuse beyond carbon. The carbon atoms have compressed and are stacked like marbles. Basically the electron clouds are repulsing each other with something called electron degeneracy pressure to prevent the mass from collapsing further. Thats it the heat it radiates will eventually trillions of years! cool off and youll eventually have a dark cold lump of charcoal.If the remnant after the nova is less than  solar masses but greater than . solar masses you end up with a neutron star. Stars this massive will have fused all the way to iron and like a white dwarf the atoms will compress and stack up like marbles again. The difference is the extra mass will overcome the electron degeneracy pressure and force the electron clouds into the nucleus where they merge with the protons there forming neutrons. Now you have all these neutrons stacked together like marbles as tightly packed in the core as the nucleus of an atom! The remnant is again prevented from collapsing further by quantum degeneracy pressure.The last path a stellar remnant can take is if it retains more than  solar masses after the nova. At this mass the stacked neutron marbles that make up a neutron star break and collapse even further. Theres nothing left to prevent a complete collapse so they continue collapsing down to a single point zero volume with infinite density. Thus a singularityor black holeis born.,EliteDangerous,cq2k20g,39,t5_2vi60

As soon as you see a ship start heading towards you zero your throttle and drop out of super cruise before they have a chance to interdict you.  Then throttle up  wait for your frameshift drive to recharge and go back to super cruise.  Chances are  youll be in a different super cruise instance and even if youre not  if the pirate was an NPC theyll have found something else to chase down.

3654910,0,t1_cq8vdlt,Sure I did make the purchase but it doesnt mean I have to be happy with the service I am being provided. Honestly I regret it kind of. That will depend on the next patch and the future patches. I misjudged Frontier as a company or as developersgamers I should say. And believe they are currently running an anticonsumer practice but are being praised due to being open about it  and the fact a lot of older fans are returning who have more money to spare so it doesnt bother them as much. And sure microtransactions are fine. But as I mentioned in another comment Id be okay if it was for themed skins but the fact I cant change my ships colour at all is annoying. Sure it has no effect on gameplay I guess RP counts though. But visual customisation is something I expect  at least being able to change colours like having two main colours on my ship main and secondary and being able to change those. I guarantee it would cost NOTHING. It could be done via code not graphics. I feel as if Frontier have got in bed with some larger investors who are angst on making returns and now they are hurting their consumers who will blindly follow them as they have provided a fulfilling space sim in a market where their is little serious competition.,EliteDangerous,cq8vw75,1,t5_2vi60

3693705,0,t3_32n5hq,Bounties should be applied to any pilot that attacks a ship regardless of existing bounties.  The amount of bounty is based on the affiliations of defender and the more renown within those affiliations determines how much finesbounties are worth.Example if a bounty hunter attacks and destroys a ship that has federation bounties and a high affiliation with the empire the bounty hunter will receive the federation bounty voucher but will also incur his own empire bounty based on the defenders affiliation with the empire.If ED were to be expanded to include more region based factions including pirate factions then bounty hunters will be incurring their own bounties in in different regions making it less safe to fly in those areas. This might encourage bounty hunters to ally very strongly with a few factions. They can try to remain independent but they do not give out as much fines for being killed and it is dangerous to fly in any system with a strong police presence. PS Maybe add ability for players to remotely pay fines to major factions or do it at embassy offices in major hubs so that true bounty hunters can manage income from bounties and pay fines.

This includes enabling stealth mode which will quickly build up heat in your space craft but make you invisible to scanners. This is why you need to turn stuff off precool with heat sink launcher and coast in.Option  You do the same thing but instead of going stealth mode you boost to maximum speed fly through the mail slot so fast the scanner doesnt have time to get a lock on you and then madly open the cargo hold landing gear reverse thrust trying not to crash into the inside of the station when you hit the brakes.I hope you get some use out of this guide.

3730854,0,t3_334isw,Theres a couple of factual errors in this review Spectrum version does not take  minutes to load. It takes about . minutes off tape. The Spectrum loaded off tape at an average speed of  bps with the standard loader to fill the entire K including the frame buffer would have an upper bound of about  seconds  minutes  sec. The BBC Micro did not come with a disc drive  it was an optional extra and would add another  or so to the price. The review ought to compare the tape version of BBC Elite with the Spectrum tape version. You could get disc drives for the Spectrum such as the Opus Discovery Opus also made floppy drives for the Beeb. The BBC version doesnt flicker nearly as much in real life as you see in this video. This must be an artefact of the emulator hes using. The Spectrum version at least the first release had a really awful copy protection system called the LensLok that hardly ever worked right. He ought to have mentioned this. Every Speccy Elite player hated this thing. I think it got dropped from later releases. Bounties. The BBC showed you your total balance when you got a bounty not the amount of the bounty so it wasnt that generous  it was pretty much the sameI think the BBC version had the best sound effects for Elite and has only been beaten by Elite Dangerous.

3753637,0,t3_33ejem,In my experience if you like bounty hunting at RESs youve pretty much hit the peak with the Vulture. I own a FDL and use it for combat zones mostly but to be honest Im not sure its much of a step above the Vulch. Turning radius is slow in the FDL slower in a Python. Yeah you can dump out some serious firepower with both and tank quite a bit in return but its worthless read less efficient than a vulture in the same situation against the small quick ships that outmaneuver  outpace you. In RESs it seems that Spawn rate can be linked to the number of pirates in the area and if youre stick in a heavy shiplight ship rotation than you either need to kill off the little buggers or wait for security to get around to it before you can enjoy killing. This can be easily done in a vulture but is a chore in larger ships.Outside of RES bounty hunting The Python and the FDL are akin to the CobraViper comparison. The python is combat capable but will cost an arm and a leg to make it as capable as the FDL but it can be reconfigured to be a trade vessel exploration ship albeit shorter jump range than an asp closer to a cobra mining ship or pretty much any multiple role you choose. Whereas The FDL like the viper shoots things dead and thats pretty much it. ,EliteDangerous,cqk543l,1,t5_2vi60
3753702,0,t3_33d1sj,DO NOT DO IT.Thrusters are correctly placed on an way hat switch. A joystick for thrusters is silly indeed because you have to move the joystick all the way to the end of its travel to get  thrust. The game does not require such granularity of thruster control EXCEPT when landing  and that is why I map forward and reverse thrust and leftright thrust to the analog joystick on my throttle in Landing Override mode.In combat and normal flight you simply want thrusters to go from zero to  instantly  and that fits the profile of an way HAT switch.You have to remember that DOF navigation has been around for  years now and so there is a LOT of conventional wisdom grown up around the subject. Two joysticks is suboptimal and you will not find a good pilot using that regime.

Try them out as you have some excess Cr and see how you like them. Remember you can sell weapons for full price! You might also find ammo lasts longer than you think.  shots from a carefully aimed plasma accelerator last a while when most of the smaller ships are dead from a laser before youve lined up that many shots.Edit Oh and power consumption is way lower for weapons that use ammo mostly so that factors in when youre equipping a lot of guns.,EliteDangerous,cqkebmw,1,t5_2vi60

These PVE with added coop MP people will not stop to go to solo or groups just because the PVP bunch wants it so and if you would succeed in FD shutting down solo you would have the biggest shitstorm at your hands that you can imagine. FD has endeavoured to do a most daunting task to unite a WHOLE bunch of different playstyles under one hood.

3838824,0,t1_cqtffay,I actually think the anaconda would float.  The design looks like it would displace enough water to offset its mass while remaining remotely stable on the surface.Without ballast its hard to say if itd stay upright in rough waters but its a spaceship without very many ways that water can get in so I doubt it sinks even if it wants to.Its not a very massive or dense ship compared to what we have today of comparable sizes.  Damn you technologically superior metals And the sheer size of it means it will displace far more than its mass in water if it were to be submerged.  Thus it should easily float.I could do the math taking the volume of the anaconda and its mass vs the mass of the water it was displacing and use like real buoyancy force equations and all that but Im far too lazy.  Just at first glance and looking at the sizemass ratio of Annie it should float rather violently.I hope they take this into account for planetary landings.  I think very few of the ships in our universe would sink if any unless there was a hull breach.In any case youd prolly have to flood a ridiculous percentage of the Anaconda to submerge and youd prolly need to flood at least part of the bottom so it didnt float so far above the surface that it would roll or lean.

3852636,0,t1_cqvdqfw,The first few weeks shield cell banks were implemented were horrendous. The low cost and high ammo count meant that the more shield cells you have you won. They were the things that eliminated skill in pvp but I wont deny that I dont understand why they did it it was to give newer players a chance against higher skilled and experienced players. And what were their balance? Instead of making the cell banks add additional rings to the shield they reduced the ammo count and increased their performance cost as well as their ammo cost effectively countering their assumed initial goal of leveraging the skill gap between new players and veterans. Now we have boosters that basically does that which I mentioned with the rings. That is what they should have done in the first place. That was a lazy job and no one can deny that. Before all of these boosters and banks and Hull reinforcements being the better pilot rewarded you and rightfully so. The old system rewarded creativity and strategic planning in dogfights always forcing you to change your ways and adapt because once your Shields were down you would be at a disadvantage. The skillful pilot would have a sense of accomplishment that he was good enough to overcome his opponent and not be punished because he didnt carry cell banks. Even if you traded hardpoints for control over drones it would only mean that the drones would either have to be stronger than some weapons for its respective class or theyd be ignored entirely. But when thats the case why add a combat drone in the first place? Why not add other weapons and weapons types with real minution types i.e two with armor piercing rounds and two with shield piercing rounds that allows pilots to specialise rewarding and enticing group play? Fact of the matter is FD have written incredible concepts and so far we have only been granted the most simplest and basic form of them. Every time something is implemented its extremely plain and bare bones but their reason for that is that they want to build the foundations first then build on that later.,EliteDangerous,cqvfp35,1,t5_2vi60

3878484,0,t3_34ura4,The game as it is currently setup is far more egalitarian...  I tried Eve for about  months after being drawn to it from the publicity surrounding the BRRB battle.  Eve is simply not even remotely newbie friendly since folks who have been playing for years have a HUGE skill advantage simply because time has passed.   In ED the skill differences are more directly related to the skills of the actual person who is piloting as opposed to the timebased character skills implants etc.  On a related note being filthy rich or willing to spend real money wont help...  So no way to buy your way into combat superiority.  Sure sure the expensive ships are expensive and require a genuine investment in time but nothing on par with Eve capital ships.  Since . has only been recently released and there is currently nothing like sov group pvp tactics and strategy is in its infancy.  On the other hand pvp is a different beast altogether since you dont have very many options once your shields drop and it is relatively easy to just leave when that happens i.e. there is no point scram or web in ED.  The closest you get to that is outweighing your opponent by a great deal i.e. be in a larger ship which does make it take longer for them to enter supercruise or warp away.  But if they are in a big ship too you dont even get that advantage.  Solo mode is a godsend frankly compared to the unholy hell newbies have to endure in Eve.  Griefers in eve drove me out since there was virtually no way to play solo in Eve.  Trade in Eve was not my thing and I got tired of grinding level s which the Machariel rendered trivial.  Basically Eve is a much more rich experience with lots of seeming possibilities.  But you are forced to play in a corp to realize any of them.Lastly and too as others have said ED is a simulator. Eve even when flying in space or what have you feels more like a really complex board game especially true when TiDi kicks in.As others have said there needs to be more to do.  But that seems to be coming. My only hope is that they dont add mechanics that allow creation of virtually unassailable dynasties...  e.g. Goonswarm.,EliteDangerous,cqydpx8,1,t5_2vi60

3882699,0,t3_34wmug,I suggest you learn something about power values and management before buying the most expensive combatonly ship in the game.Every combat ship has a limited power plant. You cant just stick whateverthefuck on it and expect it to function. Not only that but any ship with all beam lasers will outright cook itself and you inside of it. And what even are utilities? No chaff for combat? Scanners for pve? Heatsinks for all of those beam lasers?Youre sounding like you have no idea what youre doing posted some random clicking on edshipyard and are expecting other people to do your brainwork for you. A A interdictor and a A fuel scoop? A docking computer for debatably the second best handling big ship in the game? And in all of this clicking to only put the best of the best of everything on your ship you forgot bulkheads?The FdL can go about  over its maximum allotted power with a toprated power plant.

You need to make sure that your ship has the cargo space to hold it and you have the money to buy it. And every system only sells some items based on a theme. Extraction economies which you can view in the galaxy and system maps sell metals and ores. Agricultural economies sell food products and related items. You get the idea.

In my case though Ill probably save for an Anaconda first. I hear they are still strong for combat although maybe not if that is your way of earning and if Im gonna dick around I want to dick around in a space yacht that goes where no man has gone before. After that though Ill probably hit up the FDL or whatever other PvP ship is leading the way.

I am guessing their maneuverability is much worse and I was told that when you have a full load you will also loose maneuverability.For me it doesnt seem profitable for us to run like that cause he will either be taking a hit in his profits having to jettison cargo for me to sell  and I wouldnt be getting much profit  of a k run is only crIt appears LARGE trade groups are where the group effort  are at.,EliteDangerous,cr5q5ff,1,t5_2vi60

High jump ignoring Mass lock is a brilliant FU to gankers because it gives their victims a chance to escape if they can just last ish seconds.  Submitting to an interdiction being handled different than resisting is great because it ruins their plans and makes sense if the FSIM is supposed to be a tethering device.And the whole OpenGroupSolo is IMO brilliant and allows us as the customer to have the experience in the game we want to have.

3993207,0,t1_crbfv7r,Thanks. Im not sure you understand this situation though so I feel its pointless to keep arguing about two different opinions. Obviously you dont have any moral towards other players and see ED as a game of PvP and competition. As you said you dont have any honor either and therefore dont honor other players wishes for instance not getting buttraped in  seconds.Im glad youre trying to somehow fix the issue between normal players and savage brutes that KOS by this code of conduct thing but honestly do you really see a player in a Hauler getting interdicted by  Arated top ships getting ripped in  second by a total of  hardpoints while the pilot in the hauler is typing stop please Im following X code?No. Thats why developers limit what they players can do in so many games. They know that young players given the opportunity will ruin the experience of the game for their own joy. Its not a theory you can take a look at ANY game. Grinders  smurfers in CSGO spawn killers in every FPS game ganking in MMOs. There has been so many instances of what youre enjoying to do that the only reason to solve this was just to limit what players can do.FDs vision as I interpret it has been to give a players to opportunity of open gameplay in a galaxy. I appreciate their solution to Solo but I feel that maybe i would like to play with other nice friendly players like me. I dont want to come on this game to become frustrated because I was ripped in  second. Many players come on this game to enjoy it. Have you ever thought why groups like MBIUS even started? To filter out the dicks in this game. A place where mature people can play nice. Do you honestly feel that the state of this game is good with half the player base playing in Private groups other  in solo and the last  wishfully thinking it still can be a nice experience in Open? I dont.The only way to fix this is to make a murderer fear for every lightyear he flies. You dont easily get away with murder in real life why should you in ED? Either that or give players arenas or PvP zones.Then again this wont solve people like you or Bangfish vision of the game to gank. Atleast he comes up with a ridiculous RP excuse to do it and while better then nothing he played without a wing in Summerland and actually gave people a chance to escape given that they somehow can outrun a Clipper.What Im complaining about again is the ganking. I dont feel that a v wing interdiction is fair and if people get any joy out of frustrating or making someone lose millions of cargo worth in a blink of a second then I personally believe those players need to grow the fuck up. Yeah I have an Anaconda an FDL a Python clipper  and enough money to kit them ALL but you dont see me running after defenseless players with feelings making them quit the game in frustration. Because you see Im not a dick.,EliteDangerous,crbgjf7,-1,t5_2vi60

PVP is a cluster fuck of Anacondas and PythonsFDLs at the moment. It only gets worse with cheaper rebuys however if that Conda now costs  mil to rebuy maybe those same players will think twice about bringing it to a fight.

4004800,0,t1_crcpwv7,Hey I only got the hang of trading a few days ago but maybe I can help explain. When you go to a stations bulletin board and accept a mission that asks for a delivery of certain cargo you will have to go out and find what they need and bring it back. The easiest way to do this is Find Commodity on  and then use that to know where to go.For this newly announced community goal I havent checked it out in game ust yet I think you just go there accept the mission and start hauling any kind of metal you can find which seems pretty easy. You could make more profit at the same time by sourcing your metals from stations that also carry rare items and pick some up to sell when you return with the CG metals. I think theres a bunch of systems nearby wolf  to find rares.Ive been flying a cobra for about a week now and its an awesome ship for the price. If youre still in a sidewinder then definitely go do some simple noncombat bulletin board missions until you can afford a hauler then do some multihop trade routes you can find on  again until you can afford the cobra. This might take a couple of days of playing but it will get you really good at navigating.Im assuming that the more metals you deliver to the CG goal the better your reward and it will still be running for  weeks so yeah Id work on buying a cobra before trying to work on this goal since from what I gather reading this thread its not very profitable straight away.,EliteDangerous,crcs0sw,3,t5_2vi60

Ik this is npc and not actual players but drop ships are so easy to out maneuver and keep out of range making it trash in my eyes for solo combat. Idk how good of a trade ship it can be compared to a python. If your going pure combat i would suggest the fdl. Its got fire power speed and Maneuverability for those large and small ship fights.

4048607,0,t1_crhmnc9,Ok. Heres some schooling for you Fixed beam and a gimp pulse might work if you put them in different fire groups with switching to multis only when shield is down why multicannons on a pirate vessel though? Multicannons rarely work other than in short ranges and as a pirate you need weapons that disable shields and subsystems asap. Separate fire groups ensure you to pick whenever the beam is on target and use pulse for constant damage while he is in your sights. The fixed beam is good against targets far off I guess. However you can go all gimb and deselect target if he pops chaff. You lose info but your lasers will fire like fixed.Sys and weapon pips you absolutely need to learn to switch between settings. Whenever you pass the enemy and he does not have aim on you you switch to full weapon pips to increase cooling and put the rest of the pips in sys or engines depending on which one you need charged. Against a vulture you need to use your clipper speed against his inferior speed boosting past him and maybe another boost to aim towards him. This also requires you put pips in engines to ensure superior boost speed.,EliteDangerous,crhrtjg,2,t5_2vi60

4098416,0,t3_37evtz,The problem with any and every online game is that there is very little data you can send in Reliable Packets. Most game data is extremely time dependent and packets which do not arrive in the correct sequence are not requested from the peer again in normal circumstances.Even a small amount of packet loss can have major effects on an online game  particularly with peers who are flakey. NO peer ion this game isnt flakey.Flakey is what a domestic Internet connection is. It is shit. It is unreliable. It has varying amounts of bandwidth packet loss ping time and uptime.Often ISPs will dump game packets causing loss or even worse  delay them adding ping time and causing the other peers to drop the packets because they do not arrive in a timely fashion.Frontier could do a lot more to solve the problems perhaps by putting matchmaking servers in NZ andor Aus and also with code refinements  but the basic premise remains the same. The servers are not the arbiters of the game. They are matchmakers and logmakers only  the peers control the game  and the peers are flakey as fuck.Commercial game servers have very special properties they have known clean lines with no buffering filtering or interleaving. They are massive math machines with huge bandwidth and data traffic. They have guaranteed bandwidth and up time. In other words they are not flakey.Without a proper ClientServer architecture it is not possible to make a good system where all the clients are partial hosts and all the clients are flakey.,EliteDangerous,crng0v7,1,t5_2vi60

Beseiger didnt do anything wrong and honestly he should be commended for staying around to fight to the death. A true space viking if you ask me. CMDR An onion was in the vulture and also didnt do anything sketchy. The third guy though in a Python PBA something was the name we got his shields down and got his hull to  or so the he typed in local gg nice work. His hardpoints were still out so he didnt do the nav lock recharge exploit and additionally his FSD never charged. About  seconds after his shields dropped they immediately refilled with no recharge animation  went from empty rings to full Rather than .I do want to make it clear that Beseiger didnt do anything fishy and neither did the vulture pilot  but the person they were winged with did something super fishy. I dont keep track of who is in what group and stuff so basically if the Python pilot wasnt with CS maybe warn other folks that winging up with a stranger who might resort to definite exploiting reflects badly on them.No communicqtion happened except during the initial interdiction where the Python said Die fed scum onionhead  lyf  blaze it,EliteDangerous,crounw8,1,t5_2vi60

Doom has a marine real thing fighting demons an idea very widely held using various guns a real thing. Is it not a simulation because the guns are not accurate? I have no idea how accurate they are Is it not a simulation because the demons are not lifted directly from mythology and are instead interpretations? Is it not a simulation because it is set in space?To discuss your example you consider Flight Simulator to be a simulation because of the accuracy by which the software models the flight dynamics of various aircraft yes? If you were to download a mod which adds a completely new aircraft which has never existed would this still be a simulation so long as it used realistic flight mechanics? What if the mod also introduces an alien planet where the atmosphere is different or there are other effects?What Im getting at is... what is your point where something stops being a simulation?,EliteDangerous,crp6ra0,2,t5_2vi60

There are zones in reality that are off limits for people who arent a part of whatever group happens to control them.Except that these blockades actually weaken the settings consistency and immersion on the basis of the game world not reacting to such operations as the real world would read the local authority resisting. Such blockades essentially abuse the lack of consequence and the limitations of the background sim.Player guilds would certainly be less of an issue if the game would treat them as what they are  a loose association of a few independent pilots  and remember their deeds for future interaction. However that is sadly not what the game or any other game is currently capable of so artificial limitations need to be in place to preserve the viability of the single pilot and allow Elite to keep the option for adventures the likes of which we get to read in this games novels. gt None of this is different if Im able to do so while also being in a guild.

And yet an exploration fit Hauler outperforms both of these while an exploration fit Adder performs similarly. None of them hold a torch to the Asp or Conda if you had the money for them anyway.LY in civilized space for a Courier is not bad. Compare this to a Vulture or FdL which commonly get ltLY ranges combat fit. After I sold my LY FdL I wonder how Id ever flown in it in the first place.A combat fit Cobra has a similar jump range to a combat fit DB while having much more utility flexibility. A combat fit Viper performs similarly in combat to a DB at about half the cost. A combat fit Courier blows all of them out of the water in combat capability by sacrificing jump range.The thing about a scout ship is that theres no reason to have it currently. We know of nothing hostile out there in the middle of Bufu Nowhere with the exception of some vague dev comments. When someone gets rekt by the first Thargoid capital ship at xyz coords maybe a combat capable jumpship will be more enticing. But as of now it doesnt have a place alongside the Orca.Ill restate this I really do like the DB. It looks fantastic sounds fantastic and is a really well designed ship.

4150146,0,t3_387sx1,I spent last Saturday interdicting early game CMDRs in Kremainn acting as a delivery boy who was trying to give them a package.I was in an Anaconda fit out for light combat so this may or may not have had a sway in whether people actually stopped or not.Standard protocol was Interdict Greetings CMDR! It appears you have a package! Are you one CMDR name ?If yes Great! Lets see... Roll random mood dice Rewards for people who actually talked back ran from A free T sample of jerky from the Kremainn Butcher Co. to Youve won Kremainn Corps weekly lottery of T of gold! to Someone arranged to have T of Biowaste delivered to you... Now who wouldve done that?If no Oh alright. Sorry to bother you!I interdicted about  CMDRs.  talked right away I gave them their prize and they were off.  ran and after at most two more interdictions finally gave in. Note that I was always asking Sir please! I just need to confirm the package is for you!Two of the ones who finally gave after multiple interdictions in were rightly suspicious. One in a Vulture said Is the package missiles? looking at my loadout and the other in a Viper refused to get within km of me until after about  minutes of convincing. By far the best response was a CMDR whom I elected to give Biowaste and replied Ah that must be from my exwife. I wonder how she tracked me down?Any CMDR who ran after  interdictions was shot to shields down and if they continued to run destruction via  seeker racks. Stop wasting my time! You people have to make these deliveries so hard! This happened twice.Two CMDRs I interdicted immediately fired on me. They were both made short work of after an attempt to communicate with hardpoints retracted. Hold your fire! Im just a delivery man!One very unfortunate Sidewinder was destroyed upon the first interdiction as he refused to communicate even when his shields were down and drives out he rebooted twice and kept trying to low wake out from my Anaconda. He was the only Sidewinder I found that night.it really is hard to give people free stuff in this game ,EliteDangerous,crtbx6u,3,t5_2vi60

4153393,0,t1_crtorhr,Really though I dont even understand the need for a huge cash sink in this game. There isnt even a player economy that could be ruined by everyone being billionaires eventually.Once you get the best ship and fully kit it why does it matter if you have billions of credits? At that point you have reached endgame where its not about making money so much as just having things to do like PvP for instance.The game shouldnt be about making credits this is what everyone complains about in the first place is the grind. I am fine with having tons of different reputation to farm and module rewards at the end of each etc. involved with powerplay. Just give me a fun way to do it that doesnt involve me spending time grinding credits just to play the game.I dont understand your point about predatory behavior. Currently the price of death is so high that it makes people want to prey upon targets. Ganking someone causes a lot of grief due to high insurance costs right now. It would be less satisfying for the ganker if the victim had little to lose from dying.Edit Nevermind I understand now you are saying large ships are more likely to be the predators if they have less to lose.

4164057,0,t1_cruvi2y,I beleive the reduction in damage is also to keep the large guns in check somewhat. Without damage reduction class  and  weapons would need to have a large damage boost to keep their time to kill relatively the same as before but then they could nearly instantly kill smaller ships because of their sheer damage output. For example c guns do  damage and c do . When shooting a conda the c only does  damage while the c still does . If there was no damage reduction a c would still do  damage but the c would now do . Damage reduction helps the smaller ships survive by keeping the absolute damage spread between weapon class tighter. If that wasnt there larger ships would just instagib smaller ships. ,EliteDangerous,cruwu22,1,t5_2vi60

And the complaints about the Vultures cost to performance ratio are also no longer valid due to the price drop.

4222855,0,t1_cs1k1dv,Well my point in its entirety is Armor doesnt damp spaceship sounds as they are primarily generated inside the armor. Armor is the thing that protects the outside of the ship. Protective structures inside your ship is not armor but is as you say bulkheads and hull reinforcement. And while a thruster per design needs an opening to work the thruster nozzle is covered in armor itself so it isnt outside the armored layer of the ship.Now as to your claim that more internal mass would dampen noise that is just not true. Ten centimetres of steel is much worse at dampening sounds than say ten centimetres of styrofoam. Sound conductivity is not directly proportional to mass. Noise cancellation is all about insulation to stop sound waves from propagating and that is probably not something a fighter ship designer is going to bother with. ,EliteDangerous,cs1l2hv,1,t5_2vi60

Because it doesnt protect against that PP kill. THIS IS THE PROBLEM. Not sustainability or lack of internals. The fact that the PP module dies within a few seconds of shields going down has forced the shield meta. You want to tank damage? Do  in your shields  in your hull. Now its  shields  hull and even less when SCBs are taken into consideration. You cannot fix shield cells without fixing the hull damage model. This lack of hull tanking leads directly to the overuse of lasers. If the hull would last longer than  seconds when shields were down then missiles  torpedoes cannons would all see increased usage to actually finish a target.

Of course you can solo play in PP combat zone Crime sweep militarysecurity strikes ... kill the AI ships and make some money and merits but IMO the most interesting thing to do is undermining.

More so I cant see where I mentioned that logitech wheel? i cant also see where did u metion ur logitech g didnt work in the Xbox in your original comment.This is what you mentioned The steering wheel fiasco on the previous gen not being able to use a Logitech wheel over there pathetic MS xbox one was a prime example.

I still am entitled to have my own opinion am i not?

4300291,0,t3_3a8sgo,I think this is just the nature of games with steep learning curves. They tend to be very unforgiving for new players. In my opinion that makes for the most rewarding experience when you finally do understand what you are doing. Especially in a day and age with quick time press X to win events objective markers and free respawn checkpoints every  seconds this game can be very frustrating to the new player. Just know that all the people who have been enjoying the game for months in their Anaconda likely went through the same frustrations made the same docking mistakes missed their first  supercruise exits ran into the same station arm and thought they hit it big in their sidewinder when they stumbled across free gold in the middle of space. These frustrating experiences are part of the game and what sets it apart from the rest.

4301621,0,t3_3a9a6h,the vulture is simply king of the hill for the sake of this comparison FDevs chosen weapon mechanics basically are set up so x class  weapons just do more damage than x class  and x class  weapons especially to larger ships.  its also more maneuverable than both the viper and DbS and stacks a bigger shield.  the only thing it loses on is straight line speedthe DbS is a slight upgrade over the viper slightly better hardpoint placement more jump range more power can allow slightly more shields as you can fit a couple boosters and a cell bank easily and is a decent stepping stone up to a vulture but its not going to beat the vulture in terms of effectiveness.  you might see a bit of an improvement from the viper but thats about it.the DbE doesnt have that great of shields despite the class  shield gen spot only slightly better than the unboosted viper and its slower and less maneuverable than all other ships involved in the conversation.  it may have the class  and x class  hardpoints which is better weaponry than the viperDbS but its not really a combat ship.  by having the class  weapon and class  shield slotted youre going to run into some power issues and still have weaker shields than the vulture.tldr vulture is still the best of these ships,EliteDangerous,csaimil,2,t5_2vi60
4301966,0,t3_3a990a,first of all you are going to need to know which stations have a black market you can check this on the system map. it will state Black Market under the list of facilities eg rearm outfitting etc.secondly check what type of economy the station is industrial agriculture etc. different stations will consume different items. its no use smuggling illegal tobacco or liquor to stations that produce them.thirdly check the type of government the system has. different systems will outlaw different goods e.g. i think dictatorships ban personal weapons and theocracies ban alcoholnarcotics. its no use smuggling goods that are not illegal in the target system.fourth you might want to do a small run of a unit or two first where you just go and scope out the supplydemand of the station you want to smuggle to. if it doesnt turn a profit youve only made a one unit loss. since you cant view the black market without having illegal goods in the first place youll need to bring at least one unit with you.if the profit is large smuggle like a madman.,EliteDangerous,csak0ud,1,t5_2vi60

4303415,0,t3_3aa8x8,I ducked out for a long while. There are various improvements now that have made me stick around the second time... Wings and Community Goals mean Open play can be much more focused and playful. If you want to get involved in blockadebreaking trade pirating for fun or bounty hunting pirates etc then you can find all that now  Recent improvements to AI have helped make the NPC encounters seem that bit more believable and a touch more challenging. The new ships offer some fun targets to work towards. The Vulture is an absolute beast but try and buy it in a system where youll be sticking around to bounty hunt etc as its jump range is woeful. The DB Explorer is another midlevelish ship that offers rugged combat decent class  hardpoint if not ideally placed but with other bells and whistles like great jump range and some reasonable cargo space etc. Good fun as a combatweighted allrounder. I had some joy pirating NPCs plenty of room for collection drones etc. Mining with drones is a relaxing and viable side pursuit now and can be a dangerous one if you wing up with a defender buddy and head into the high intensity RESes.  Powerplay isnt for me currently but looks like a fun RP layer for the latergame guys. It does add some flavour and profit to the galaxy even if you dont use it tho. Want to see how much more profitable smuggling is now? Then why not head to the pirate power where blackmarkets offer  on top.CAVEATS Plenty of stuff is still ropey or nighbroken. Missions still seem to fluff their lines fairly frequently for example although the new tiering for lategamers is promising. The neat new addition of NPC chat in Supercruise is also pretty flakey at the mo. Tracking down assassination targets in Supercruise has been a step in the right direction though and the increased missions for smugglers  explorers etc. Youre only really gonna enjoy all this stuff if youre prepared to use the framework to make your own fun ,EliteDangerous,csapx2k,2,t5_2vi60

If I get to refuel sooner I do it but Im not worried because I check the galaxy map as often as possible for rare stars.

4449651,0,t3_3by9km,The vulture is the easiest RES ship I have found.  Pvp is annoying because you only have two hard points to work with.  It has enough firepower and shields to be great in squadrons.  It is not a solo terror though.Clippers are the true solo terror think twice before you stop one.  At x the price of a vulture.  They are fastest ship in the game maneuverable have more weapon slots to balance energy and kenetic damage better have more weapon power to fire their beams longer and they have the power for almost any build but needs a large landing pad and have  the shields of a vulture.The only real drawback is the large pad...

4456837,0,t1_csrjzqm,I like the idea but to remove SCBs now would mean a lot of rebalancing. You would have to remove the recharge delay almost completely so after shields went down they would be back up in  seconds if powered. Heavy hitting weapons would also need a look at and maybe lower the projectile speed. I really prefer that you would have to sacrifice power to boost your shields in the way the speed boost works now. Minimal balancing would need to be done and greater management of power will be needed. At least CMDRs would have to micro manage power to keep shields up and the attacker can press the advantage. Add a little thermal load so no one can just keep boosting shields and dont allow a huge amount of shield regen with each activation. Ok new idea. Hitting the shield boost gives a Tempory damage reduction for say    seconds and you can even use it after your shields have gone down. You could have different types one that is better against thermal kinetic damage or both. Its almost am and Im not sure if Im making sense lol.... ,EliteDangerous,cssgs7i,2,t5_2vi60

The armor requirements are nuts to stop kinetic impactors and what ideas folks have for energy shields wouldnt even stop a pistol round.Now that I think about it those submarines would have problems as well due to how nuclear fission reactors can be detected by their neutrino signature even from the other side of the planet.  Fusion reactors might be able to blend in with the solar Flux from far away not much info about comparitive neutrino output but you would still have a giant target painted on your back from the distortion of the earths magnetic field from that much metal.God help the navy if someone figures out how to make a neutrino detector small enough to fit on a ship.,EliteDangerous,csu408e,2,t5_2vi60

4492203,0,t1_cswf4nk,I can see why youd want something like that but that really isnt what this game is about. Its supposed to make you feel worthless and alone in the beginning and leave the rest up to you to make your own path. You arent supposed to be a hero or some majorly OP guy who builds stations all over the place by destroying everything because then what will be done with the other players? For example what will happen when thousands of players want to save the princess? We sure cant have a thousand knights in shining armor to do it because then that takes away from the experience of a single person who expected to be the hero. Or what about destroying stations? If you could destroy stations now there would never be any place to dock. The very first thing I did when I bought this game was shoot at the station to try and destroy it. The game sets you up from the very beginning to not expect to change anything without a greater power involved. I really like what youre describing though and Id love to see some game like this because it totally sounds awesome!

Because while it might be possible to do with stuff like thrusters and shields I find it hard to believe that it would work with things like your power distribution both in terms of power plant and power couplings. Especially the later is quite literally about exchanging all the wiring in your ship so you can divert more power between your systems XPersonally Im of the opinion that the exchange of parts is mainly that quick and easy because everything else would be boring for players.

Some people with this issue can change usb ports to fix personally I had to buy a powered usb hub to stop this.The display on the throttle is tempermental. It doesnt display your inputs or names of macros and modes consistently depending on your driver version.The profiling software is terrible and crashes easily. It is otherwise easy to use to actually set up bindings though IMO.The stick is kinda loose not a big deal but you mentioned this about the x. The throttle does have a tightness knob that works alright.If you set the brightness on the lights too low they flicker just a minor issue.

4694274,0,t1_ctm8aae,Skip the interdictor for now. If you want to make money quickly and if you dont have a lot of cargo space because you have a small ship you want to bounty hunt in a Resource Extraction Site. Get all gimbaled weapons unless youre a space combat stud. Get the KWS it is critical it boosts payoffs from kills. Go to a High Intensity RES. Log out and log in until you see big ships like Federal Dropships and Imperial Clippers appearing in the first spawns. Plus cops. You have a weaker ship you need cops around. Yes relogging is weak sauce but it is the difference between k kills and k kills. When you see a big fat ship being attacked buy the cops fly over and use your KWS. Assuming the ship is actually Wanted light it up. You might want to wait until shields are down. Make sure there are cops in the fight too to soak up return fire. If cops arent engaged with the dude yet maybe you can shoot him first and then fly to where the cops are. It will take some experimentation to see what you can get away with. I do suggest targeting the power plant when you engage larger ships. You should be able to make k to k per kill this way. Clearing a million credits in an hour shouldnt be a problem IF you get good spawns in the RES. I did this as a newb in a Sidewinder you can definitely do it in an Eagle. Only once has any ship in a RES attacked me without provocation. You can just fly around and scan all these criminal assholes looking for prey. They dont seem to care. Eventually you will be able to afford a tougher ship and then you wont need to wait for the cops to help and you will make money more quickly to buy a bigger ship... but that train runs out of steam pretty quickly. I quickly went from Sidewinder to Adder to Viper. I stuck with Viper for a long time and just got my Courier. Now I can solo those Dropships and Clippers but honestly the fancy Courier isnt any more fun than the Viper. It does let me do a little more of everything at once though which I appreciate.

Youll need some cash. I suppose if your Chris Roberts and have a nice fan base largely made up of adult affluent Americans then great you can talk about how having made that much cash deadlines no longer apply. Otherwise youd better find a publisher and spend a minimum five years or so on development and dont mention it to anyone expect a huge backlash from PC gamers anyway and dont even think theyll be reasonable if you want to port it to a console.Consumers should take some responsibility though. There were lots of reviews that probably said that Elite wasnt a game about mazes full of things to click on that opened cut scenes or a third person wizard that ran around hitting people with mouse clicks or something.

Both have a long grind to fill a lack of current content that is yet to come. Existing players can buy the expansion for  while new players get both for . We have a similar Loyalty discount keeping our costs just under full retail for both. Keep in mind we are getting a ships update to the game before expansion as well as CQC.

No Mans Sky will be a great buy if it fulfills all of its promises.I am excited for the ground stuff even if it is on a lifeless airless world. I am concerned for the future of Elite though.

But if they charge any more than  for both things combined new players are very unlikely to buy the game and its expansion pack close together. And if they charge very little for old players to upgrade to Horizons they wont make much money off of it.Perhaps a good way of thinking of it is that new players are simply getting the game on sale at the cost of not being able to play it until a year after its release. That happens with every game the price goes down and those who wait get it cheaper but obviously they couldnt play it until after waiting.,EliteDangerous,ctthghk,1,t5_2vi60
4751695,0,t3_3fzp7d,Son Im not sure what you are trying to pull here but a season pass is just a bundled of DLC as opposed to it being individual. Its the same damn thing. Oh the base game comes with the expansion!? HOW USEFUL! I really needed the original game because you know I just dont have it thats why Im wanting to buy the expansion. You know for kicks. This whole bundle thing is scumy as hell and anyone with two neurons to rub together knows it. The bundle is an excuse to charge  for an expansion. An expansion to a game should never be the same price as the original game and you sure as hell shouldnt be bundling it together and saying its a bargain if you dont own it. The playerbase owns it its not savings if the people most interested in the damn game already have the base game.Lastly lets not use modern AAA games as a good example of value and pricing. One look at gtas steam summer sale or the hilariously unfinished dlc ridden nature of these modern titles should be well aware that while they sell and make money they are still shit games half the time and such not ideal to compare to this or well most products. ,EliteDangerous,ctthv77,12,t5_2vi60

4785188,0,t1_ctx663r,OK I sense the source of your confusion.Allow me to clarify pledging allegiance to a power will have zero effect on anything you do in a combat zone. What you will be doing is local mercenary work. Your combat zone kills will award you combat bonds which are cashed in locally much like bounties. In order for this to happen you need to follow all of these steps  Locate and fly into a combat zone  Pick a side When you first drop out of supercruise you will see ships but none of them should appear on your radar as red or whatever your HUD color for bud guy may be. You must look to the righthand screen and tab over to functions. The first option in the functions menu is faction. Outside of a CZ this will always say none but when you enter a CZ you will have two options. It doesnt matter which one you pick unless youre actively trying to flip a system and if you dont know what that means dont worry about it. Point is this is where you declare who youre fighting for in the combat zone. Your choice is also not permanent. If you pick XYZ Purple Boys and then leave and come back later you will have to choose sides again and you can pick the opposite side with no financial penalties. It seriously does not matter unless you care about local faction rep but you must declare a side to earn credit for your kills. Claim your bondsWhen youre all done fighting dock at a station in the system where you earned combat bonds go to starport services gt contacts gt combat bond contact and it will show the combat bonds that are available to be cashed in. This is how you get paid. I do believe you lose any unclaimed bonds when you die so be careful out there. Hope this helps and if you ever want to wing up find me ingame Mohavor.,EliteDangerous,ctxpo3q,1,t5_2vi60

4832523,0,t3_3h21sf,I am currently having an issue in this game that I had in game called Warframe. Ill spare you story time and just get down to the nitty gritty the basic mechanics of each game are not intrinsically pleasing enough to justify the boring ceaseless grind that is centric to their entertainment value. This especially disappointed me with Elite Dangerous as I had heard such great things about its lore and story in previous titles. What ever they did right then they just forgot to do it again for ED. This left ED as a husk of its predecessors and a lacking experience in those respects.And yet there are always those who are perfectly happy with the grind. I dont understand why and frankly I dont have time to. School and responsibility leave me with maybe an hour tops per day to play video games and spending that grinding to get to a point where I can have fun is just counter productive.TLDR  ED players are cool with the grind that turns you off of the game hence the dont like it gtfo attitude. The grind wouldnt be so bad if the game and its universe were more intrinsically pleasing and rewarding to experience.Edit Clarified some stuff see below. Would also like to state that the grind wouldnt be as draining if it felt like all of that work meant something more than just lods emone. Right now all that comes of BH grinding a HI RES is cash. Instead of just making money you could also slowly repel crime from that part of the system however a trader has been supplying weapons to the local crime syndicates. So when you move on to another system that HI RES and other places in the system slowly become over run by squabbling bandits. Suddenly the grind is more than just a grind it is an action and a consequence in a living breathing universe. The intrinsic reward behind the grind would simply be a hand in the workings of the galaxy. More grind would mean a bigger say and so current grinders would still be rewarded for their work.,EliteDangerous,cu3ogfx,5,t5_2vi60

4849605,0,t3_3haqwt,This has no basis in lore afaik but the way I understood it the actual person piloting your ship is not CMDR Virtualdust or whomever but one of the members of your team serving under you.  Hence all your credits are belong to CMDR Virtualdust amp co.  I think of myself as a faction that my pilots have aligned with.  This is why bounties disappear when you lose a ship because the bounty was on the head of your pilot not your faction although reputation is sticky as its your factions reputation at stake.  As for trade  exploration  combat rank that is sort of like reputation as well.  Trade and exploration should be clear as any exploration data would be shared with your CMDR and its more of like a trade syndicate than an individual pilot hauling stuff around.  For combat I think of your rank as being more like the level your faction is feared throughout the galaxy.EDIT Not sure why downvoted not trying to convince anyone that this is the reality just trying to reconcile the impossibility of escape pods instantly reaching distant stations or even close stations with a narrative that might make sense.,EliteDangerous,cu5ttxp,2,t5_2vi60

Youd think smugglers would want something a bit lower key than a station that you can see as soon as you jump into a system so I think itd feel a bit more apt to have them in makeshift camps on unpopulated planets.Then I realised of course they cant put core content on planets because not everyone would be able to access it because of the way theyve set up expansions.

Theres an actual game here somewhere isnt there?  Also I played the first  demos which went ok but the rd demo was a more advance combat one where youre supposed to destroy a couple ships.  But these ships seem to be vastly more maneuverable than my ship. So much so that I can barely even get them in my sites and when I do they quickly leave.  Then there is the fact that the laser weapon Ive been given just shoots stupidly forward and doesnt seem to have the ability to lock onto a target so its really damn near impossible at least for my inexperienced self to hit my targets and this causes the game to be...well...not fun.Is the xbox controller to blame?  I can understand that there is skill required and given my newbie status I dont have any yet. But given my ships seemingly lackluster ability to be good at combat Im wondering if there might be some bit of knowledge about the game that Im missing which would make it playable for me.Finally is it normally to only be able to play on Low graphics settings even with a gtx  ti?

So they set their goal to get an anaconda as that would be beating the game grind like mad and bitch even more about it. Just give these people some more goals or ideas what they could do maybe in the form of achievements. Another thing would be to get more money sinks. Like investing in a faction or companies maybe a kind of stock market  and generate more money when it goes good. This could be influenced by players as well like actively supporting or working against these factions to influence the networth and shares.Another thing would be to have CQC tournaments once in a while with price money in the millions  pretty sure that this will come. More money sinks  betting credits on fights in CQC.All in all i do think ED is getting it right when looking at the roadmap  horizons incoming looting and crafting will give people plenty to do explorers will be able to take probes from planets planetary mining different vehicles and so on.

DYou mean an unskippable min onrails landing animation at the end of every trade route vs  freefrom planets? Yes comparing the two is like comparing crusader kings to Civ because theyre historical turnbased strategy or Skyrim to Dark Souls to Witcher because they all have swords. Most people with an interest in the genre may end up playing both at some point.Anyone who spends any time with both games will see the vastly different feel of flight and the gameplay styles will diverge even further as both games develop.The real winners are the guys selling the HOTASes now space sims are back from the dead.,EliteDangerous,cuk82ur,11,t5_2vi60
4965371,0,t1_cuk8mmj,While that would work have you ever tried to keep up with the rings rotation while sightseeing? Its a challenge with a small ship one wrong move and those arms will nail you. Better yet try docking with FA off...the rotation isnt as fast at that level and its still fun.Best place to dock while matching speeds is nearest the hub. On an Orbit type station near the center or back where its narrow would be a god external spot. For the Coriolis perhaps have one or a few large pads on the outside of the center back.But then theres the issue of how does the ship cargo area interface with station? Would it be only for the bigger ships and not for existing ones that seem to need a ramp for cargo? Easier overall to just make them wide and long but still use the same system.,EliteDangerous,cukf9d7,1,t5_2vi60

4983420,0,t1_cumg89m,Well if youre looking for an asteroid field like the one in Empire Strikes Back youre out of luck. The best ED has to offer is the rings around planets or stars.The asteroid belts in the game are thin clusters of rocks. While not visually thrilling its actually a lot closer to what youd expect to find in real life. For an asteroid belt to be as rocky and populated as youd see in a ring thered have to be a LOT of mass to scatter around an entire orbit. What is out there is scattered far and wide. Its why we can send deep space probes through it to the outer planets and not worry about hitting anything.The first spacecraft to traverse the asteroid belt was Pioneer  which entered the region on July  . At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft but it has since been safely traversed by  Earthbased craft without incident. Pioneer  Voyagers  and  and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged the asteroid  Gaspra in  and  Ida in  NEAR imaged  Mathilde in  Cassini imaged  Masursky in  Stardust imaged  Annefrank in  New Horizons imaged  APL in  Rosetta imaged  teins in September  and  Lutetia in July  and Dawn orbited Vesta between July  and September . Due to the low density of materials within the belt the odds of a probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.,EliteDangerous,cumoqi5,8,t5_2vi60

5055237,0,t3_3k49jq,An important difference is that at almost any time other players can choose to switch to PrivateSolo mode. Trying to blockade a port? OK but youll only catch people willing to play your little game. You can be trivially bypassed. Trying to wear down a local faction? Cool but you have no way of knowing how many phantom pilots are supporting them behind your back.Adopting minor factions has littletono ingame support and almost zero benefit. Players cant transfer money to one another only cargo. And its clumsy. You cant own property other than spaceships. You cant manufacture anything. Powerplay has a bit of promise but participation is wildly skewed in favor of a single faction right now and FD seems fine with that.FD has created a wonderful spaceshipflying game.

5106986,0,t1_cv1dn7w,Thats not really how it works.I cant say for sure how ED works but I know how the original one did and Ive worked for a few game developers and done some networking work in this area.Basically all the clients need as a bare bones bit of data to display any system in ED would be the ID of the system and the current time.Thats it. With that it can display the system as it would appear on anyones machines.The ID of the solar system would be unique. This ID would then be used as the seed for the random number generation. This would make all calculations deterministic...meaning...for the same input you get the same output.Think of simple algebra like X  Y. This is deterministic. You can give it different values of X and Y and get different answers but the same values always produce the same answer.    is always .So the seed can be used to randomly calculate what star type it is. How many planets. Orbit distances. Orbit speeds etc etc and more importantly the starting position of the planets and their orbit speed.So you now have a completely reliable way to generate a solar system on the fly with all the planets at their starting positions then all you need is the current server time and you can just fast foward so to speak and update all the planets to their new positions. If...say...you know the planet orbits every   days and teh server time is  days simple example then plonk the planet half way round its orbit. All clients will do the exact same thing as its deterministic. No actual position date is stored at all. Literally just an ID and the current time and were all seemingly exploring the same system.Obviously this is a massive simplification but thats the general gist and is also why the original elite was so mind blowing when it came out and included billions of solar systems in just a few kilobytes of data. Even the system names were randomly generated on the fly. The items you could buy and trade were randomly generated all from teh same original seed so it would always appear the same if you revisited X seconds later.,EliteDangerous,cv1kzof,3,t5_2vi60

My biggest gripe with FD is not only did they release the game way too early with bare minimal content they also have a disconnect with a large amount of players. Whenever it looks like they are on track and taking in our feedback they find someway to make it worse. It is always  steps forward  steps back with them. Also we really need better tools ingame because at the moment organizing anything ingame is way too much of a chore. If you have to go to a website or use some sort of rd party app to achieve something in the game then you have failed.

5200118,0,t3_3m83cg,gtNow my questions are in tension areas high and low how do you guys pick side? Do you just pick whatever you think will win?Go to right panel default  gt functions and you can choose sides from there. I usually pick the side associated with major faction to give me some rep boost.gtDuring the fights Im getting shred to pieces. I target one of their ship and before I know it I have both that ship and  more on my ass and Im trying to fly away. I boost like crazy but theyll follow me til Im dead or charge out of there. Is this normal? Am I still too low level on my harmlevel so theyll automatically target and kill me first?NPCs tend to prioritize the player. Also what ship are you flying? If you are new  I would not go to combat zone in less than a decked out ViperCourier.gtAlso Ive been trying out some new weapons and really like the idea of Railguns so I have  of those then  gimball multicannons and I cant even remove the shield of some targets! I used x railgun charges on a python and didnt even remove more than  shield ring. Is this normal? Ive been trying to spend my railguns on targets without a shield but I do less than  damage and I read that railguns can do up to  damage so I was not impressed. Railgun is primarily a PvP weapon. In PvE you are best of with combination of Lasers for shields  Kinetics for hull e.g  Pulse lasers   Multicannonscannons. Pulses is generally the best choice for laser for PvE and choice between cannonsmulticannons boils down to what ship you fly larger ships favor cannons and fighting style. Also plasma accelerators can be a very effective weapons for both PvP and PvE but it is more of an advanced weapon and fitting it usually requires some compromises to be made. Missiles and torpedoes are crap and only ever used on some troll PvP fits.Also ships in the combat zones are one of the toughest NPC ships in terms of amount of raw beating they can sustain. You are better off going to Resource Extraction Sites. Payout is better and ships are less tough. Also learn to hit subsystems on larger ships. You can destroy ships powerplant killing them while they still often have  hull. Also if you are playing on mouse and keyboard I recommend starting practicing with fixed weapons. It is easier to aim them on MKB they do more damage and are unaffected by chaff.gt EDIT Oh I forgot does using my Kill warrant scanner in tension areas increase the credit gain?No it is not. It does however increase the profit from Resource Extraction Sites. Just be prepared to fly all around civilized space to collect the bounties.,EliteDangerous,cvct2rb,2,t5_2vi60

5255512,0,t3_3myu9i,Yep this is a common bug that has been occurring for awhile. However I bring hope!What Ive found that eliminates this bug  of the time when it happens is to adjust your throttle from where it is currently. In other words if your throttle is near max and all of the sudden the flashing kicks in throttle down. Likewise if you are moving slowly and it happens throttle up!Why does this work? I am not  certain but I think it has to do with the game not handling the NPCs submitting to your interdictions well or possibly your connection catching up after a brief bout of lag and realizing that the vector has changed rather dramatically. In both scenarios adjusting your throttle seems to reengage whatever algorithm is at work behind the scenes usually serving to correct itself.

5365632,0,t1_cvxi3sr,gt people could just randomly kill everyone especially larger ships which are more expensive to replace and be rewarded. Of course they could do that now but salvaging would add an incentive for bad behavior.That depends on the way the system is implemented. The way I see it every laser would be able to cut up ships but the profits would be extremely low without specialized equipment. So low that they cannot even cover the bounty that will be placed on you. In order to get serious cash specialized equipment will be necessary similarly to mining and ships that have all this equipment will be pretty shitty at fighting because that equipment takes space. gt This would also encourage teamwork a pirate wing could have three gunships to take down big targets and a salvage ship to pick up the . Thats what I was thinking. Also it will give the targets a better chance of escaping because the attackers would have to be careful not to damage the ship too much. ,EliteDangerous,cvxiqp7,4,t5_2vi60

Im currently averaging about .mhour in my humble Type . Once I have enough for my dedicated mining ASP m Im confident I can manage at least mhour.The trick is finding a nice pristinemetallic planetary ring with a station in orbit around the same planet. Use your prospector to find those rocks rich in iums and painites and have at least . collectors for every small mining laser and  collectors for every medium mining laser.Speaking of collector drones a few people have complained of them randomly exploding. Its really not random. Keep them in range travel no faster than  max with scoop deployed and align yourself correctly with violently spinning asteroids. The pathfinding on the collector drones is pretty good but they cant adjust their course once locked onto a chunk at which point the spinning asteroid has obstructed their path.

In the meantime you never have to worry about getting ganked as you will be a force to be reckoned with with a full deck of weapons   MJ shield. On the way back you find a remote station around a ring and decide to do some mining. You do that and head out for a quick bounty hunting session for some extra cash.

We should hold them to high standards sure but also expect reality. Would I rather have a game thats playable but with a few glitches here and there that get worked on as we go hell yes.

But with the ammo trade off and long charge times in PVP it would come down to a basic one use item in PVP nerfing it there.

If all I paid was year all of these excellent expansions I was in. Thats month which is incredible value for the time I spend in the game. While there is a general lack of content worse at the start the quality is so high that I ended up buying the lifetime pass when it was last available. It was expensive but considering that it was the same guy that made eliteelite IIfrontiers making ED and he doesnt seem to have lost his touch I can see it only getting better in the future and itll probably be enjoying this for years  I just got a CH HOTAS combo and now I just need a good VR for total awesome. ,EliteDangerous,cw8aa17,3,t5_2vi60

If its fixed in the same way...I would say CQC matchmaking problems mostly come from minuscule number of people actually playing it. As I said month before the release two months after . it will fade back into the void to be a gimmick no one really cares about.gtI trust FD will eventually get it sortedDICE and Activision having tons of money more and hundreds of people more were not able to create decent matchmaking system for the last  years. Most online games like WT WoT TF dota games are failing that aspect too because this is just unpredictable how the game will develop so creating a matchmaking that would be satisfactory overall is rather impossible without divisions and ELO systems implemented.So I admire your trust but lets be realistic.,EliteDangerous,cw8dv4v,1,t5_2vi60

Also ED is a space fantasy game as much as a sim. Where are the rules that say it cant have a cinematic as with other games? Its just having a dig for the sake of it and using ED as a scape goat for something most other games do. You think the trailer was done to boost sails? REALLY? You must be some kind of marketing genius. Why the hell else would you make a cinematic trailer? Im done with the argument now.

5475218,0,t1_cwbdbjg,gt I dont like the idea of soundfilesI was under the impression the game would have speech synthesis for all NPCs and conversations options would be dynamically generated using a neural network. Look up david Brabens patent on humanmachine interface.A method to allow a user to cause a machine to make an utterance together with apparatus for obtaining input from a user. The method comprises the steps of analysing the context within which the utterance is to be made creating a list of utterances appropriate to the context on a humanmachine interface creating an indication that identifies to the user those utterances that are available and allowing the user to indicate one of those utterances and causing an utterance indicated by the user to be made. The apparatus comprises a visual display configured to display a plurality of indicia angularly spaced on a locus about an origin each of the plurality of indicia corresponding to a respective option and an input device for use in indicating an angular position wherein the apparatus is configured to generate an input event corresponding to an option associated with one of the plurality of indicia at an angular position corresponding to an angular position indicated by the input device.In the game setting the user i.e. the player can operate a control such as a pushbutton to invoke a conversation interface to say something at any time in a game or the conversation interface can be triggered by the game itself. When the conversation interface is invoked the system first gathers the context from the following sources Character status. Examples of parameters that define the characters status include clothing health crimes committed visible injury current rate of movement. Current local conditions. Examples include noise level lighting level danger level is it safe to remain?. Recent history how the player arrived here. For example whether the player is legally present and to whom this presence is known any reputation that precedes the player what has been said by other characters in the immediate past. NPCs currently present what these characters are known to know about the playerwhat the player is known to know about these NPCs. Camera setting which way it is pointing what and who is visible in the scene. The player can usually exert independent control of the camera beyond the automatic movement of the camera to follow the players actions with the character. Previously spoken dialogue. This is to provide the ability to resume conversations after an interruption and to ensure that an already taken option is not repeated. Special context. If some significant event has just happened or is still happening.Then the system processes the possible responses based on this context For each NPC around the players character a script that is executable or interpretable computer code is triggered. This script interrogates the current behaviour location and appearance of that NPC and provides to the conversation interface a list of things that the player might want to say relating to that NPC together with a numeric value that indicates the importance or relevance of that response with respect to the player in the current context. For each piece of speech within recent time that has been made by an NPC within the local area a script is run for that NPC to provide the player with sensible replies or other elements. These replies are also scored based on their relevance in the current context. Note that the speech made by an NPC may not have been to the player but to another NPC and this gives rise to the possibility of the player butting in and for eavesdropping a conversation to which they are not a party. For the player a script is run for each plausible order or specific statement the player might want to make unilaterally or to the world. This would include general questions to a room full of people or a shouted utterance such as Get down! to a crowd or other phrases relevant to wider objectives the player may currently have. All these options are then aggregated and amalgamated as applicable. The topscoring responses that exceed a certain variable threshold are then presented to the user via the user interface for example as a display of text as options for the player to select. This variable threshold may be dependent on the tension of the current situation i.e. it may itself be contextual. The mood of each response can be indicated on the interface for example by colouring the background of the text or with another form of highlight.  The player can then select one of the displayed utterances and the character begins to speak it.,EliteDangerous,cwbidpl,3,t5_2vi60

5548531,0,t1_cwktxde,At least EVE online has an entire thing geared to helping people be social. I also dont feel like my ships in that game have less tech in them than a cell phone. I love open world games that tickle my imagination and look pretty.  Elite looks realistic but its really just a large ugly boring looking universe.  I understand most planets etc really all do look the same and we wont be able to fly through nebulalike colors.  Youre also thinking I need story line goals. thats not even true. In a real open world I could assassinate one of the  power struggle leaders raise into a rank of the military where I have people under me and trade and trade until I am a rich and wealthy tradesman with  an empire and something to show for my busting my ass.  The game is only open in the fact you can travel to some of the galaxy as most of it is locked off for future expansions so instead of invisible walls they have system locks.. which I guess makes it not open at all..  But thats all. Skyrim was an open world  there was so much to do even in a noncombat way I loved exploring and seeing beautiful things. So many ways to customize myself. My own house to fill with great things. I have a character for that game that is nothing but a hunter thief and trader. He hasnt even done main quest. I loot and hunt and skin and sell. He has a wife and a bitchinly decorated house. Some of the quests were a little repetitive but not as much as  the copy and paste with blanks for number targets of items to ship plus the name of the target or item and the blank for the turn in location.,EliteDangerous,cwkuhg1,3,t5_2vi60

And twitter accounts and various social media postings of David Cameron and George Osborne. and a number of UKIP People and SNP People.It Was Corbyn Influence on the labor leader that caused their election failure. And why they elected the guy who caused them to lose i I dont know.Its fact that their dangerous listen to the leaders who are facing them in Eastern Europe they are terroristic leeches.Iraq Caused their own problems by starting sectarian warfare with each other. Not being able to govern each other respectfully and with competence not corruption.Afghanistan harbored terrorists got what had to happen to protect the Western world. the UK was just fulfilling their treaty obligations to NATO. So they caused nothingIsrael was the least Europe could do after the horrors of the Jews experienced.  If it wasnt for three wars Arab countries started  Israel would not have had  to defend itself  invoking it inherent right of selfdefense under international law.Winston Churchill did no wrong he was a great man fighting against the worst things that humanity has ever come up with. Did what needed to be done to protect the planet.The debt problems were caused by everyone for mostly good intentions except the people who got loans by lying about certain important facts and they been surprised when bad things happened.They relax the laws to try to encourage more market activity and help more people by increasing bank activity it was with good intent badly thought under labor Im pretty sure to.They had to bail the bankers out it was not good but necessary. To protect the overall economy otherwise you wouldve imploded the entire economy just so you could feel good that the bankers got attacked.It led to useful reforms and governments made money the government can use on other things that are important.,EliteDangerous,cwlnv8r,0,t5_2vi60

5617215,0,t1_cwtcod8,Thats not necessarily true at all. Besides which you could have things like hatches which are very good at holding pressure but the seals might fail when pressure is applied from the opposite direction. All this is of course ignoring the obvious problem how well do thrusters vents etc. work underwater? There could be whole sections of the ship that arent pressurized or airtight at all because they dont need to support living occupants. Also the pressure just ten meters underwater undersea is about two atmospheres so even if the hull is equally strong both ways it wont necessarily be suitable as a submarine.,EliteDangerous,cwtdbpk,6,t5_2vi60

Theyd still have to be salvaged as normal but you now have a legitimate place to sell them.Unless of course the act of recovering the items marks them as stolen like it does now and youll have to sell them to the black market anyway. or is FDev changing up how salvaged cargo gets marked in your hold?,EliteDangerous,cwth5fl,4,t5_2vi60

The kinetics use very low power so u can keep  pip shields full eng  weps and do fine. One aspect of war often forgotten is distraction and fear from the point of view of the enemy. Multicannons are constantly splashing on shields causing noise and attention is diverted. If you are face to face you are also partially blinding them due to the hits. I always try to aim for the cockpit when firing on an enemy hanging up and back slightly to avoid gimbalsfixed. It is very disconcerting to them. Noise is often one of the major causes of mental breakdowns in wars action too. Multicannons affect both senses and can be quite overwhelming. No other weapon can do this to this degree.

Heatsinks take up the space that were once used by other modules and you need a lot of them if youre going to use the same ammo that you have in banks. Some people also already were using heatsinks for other heating issues.The same story stands and SCBs are basically worthless now. Hull tanking is the new game except for the problem that hull integrity does not yet to seem to equal module integrity and people are still being disabled with seemingly papermade power plants despite max hull reinforcements.

So you can think of it as a season pass if you like except that at the end of the season you can continue to play for as long as you like  albeit without any big new content  they intend to keep improving the core gameplay for everyone forever.Purchasers of Horizons therefore get the base game included because you cannot play the horizons content without it.

5711846,0,t1_cx51orq,Yeah sorry youre right there  output lag is more what I was referring to although input lag is generally what people will say regardless of how correct it is like talking about VID vs VCORE when overclocking. This makes things feel slightly less responsive for me at lower framerates and such. Vsync acting and Hz in this case just doesnt feel good to me as Ive been playing with  for about  years and anything less feels like poop to me. PIts not as big of a deal in Elite as in Quake UT CSGO etc. but its still noticeable. Heck even the desktop feels like complete crap when I drag something from my Hz main to my Hz secondary!Without some kind of sync or framepacing gsync freesync etc. itll feel less... smooth I guess you could say. When you have such a sudden drop in framerate for some reason or another its definitely detectable albeit far more easily in most other games. As you said youll have halfframes and such everywhere. Ive spoken to a few others who actually have the FPS limit for the same reason specifically because it becomes slightly choppy.I do highly doubt I could fully identify an image displayed for ms though that Ill give you P Apart from all of that its more about the slight lag due to a lower framerate. Its barely anything but still nice in addition to the extra frames FYI its definitely not microstutters. Elite has actually never had them as an issue apart from shortly after entering witch space on occasion which makes sense.,EliteDangerous,cx53zc9,1,t5_2vi60

Not to mentoint that i have paid for TWO accs with TWO lifetime expansion passes already so i am out a few  bucks in advance to have the DLCs for free.Besides my whole point was that you bark at the wrong tree.The ones that are mostly happy with how the games developent are the Kichstarters and old hogs. The ones that dont seem to get over the fact that they have to pay for the next DLC again are the kids that only see PVP combat and arent interested in PvE at all.so they dont see the reason to pay for it at all and only fear that thier targets will use the Planetary landing as escape from their weapons. ,EliteDangerous,cx89tsx,4,t5_2vi60

When you reach  seconds out from your destination set throtte to  and youll cruise nicely in.  No later than  or youll overshoot. Earlier and it just takes longer. You may need to throttle up as you get closer if somethings slowing you down and then go back to  when the timers right again.If a station is your destination  try and drop in between the destination and the planet that it orbits as stations always orbit with the Mailslot facing towards the planet. Its not exact but it usually saves you a  bit of time as you drop out of supercruise nearer the mailslot side of the station.,EliteDangerous,cxi5j6c,2,t5_2vi60

5828351,0,t1_cxj69sv,Agreed my suggestions areMove the Viper Mk up to  Million fix its agility and speed then make it a M hardpoint Class  PD competitor to the Vulture. But with less Shielding and a bit less agility than the Vulture in exchange for its generous jump range. This moves the Viper Mk into a position of being a half step down from the Vulture and to the side of the Vulture. It can certainly hold its own as a fighting ship but cant punch up like the Vulture can. This positions the Viper Mk into the position of being a great ship for a fighter who roams a bit while leaving the Vulture as the allin heavy fighter. The Viper Mk is the premier entry level fighter the Viper Mk maintains this tradition and becomes a premier mid range fighter.For the Cobra Mk it should be moved up to  Million and rebalanced against the Asp Ex. It would be slightly less agile .s more pitch than the Mk  and a bit slower  but with a great jump range  LY Max  LY Fit. When I first bought my Cobra Mk I gawked at how much it would cost to fully fit with those . Million upgrades but I wanted to deck it out and see what it could do. The Mark  should continue this tradition so I would jump all the standard components up  as well. And ungimp the shields.  Since the AspEx can still fit  more small a Shield Gen two classes higher and has a small LY advantage it stays relevant and the primary exploration ship. The Cobra Mk keeps the defining characteristics speed of the Mk and is a solid stepping stone on the way to an end game ship like a Python or CCC Cutter Conda Corvette.Asp Scout I would just redo into an expensive M hull Military version called the Asp Recon. It would keep the MS setup but gain a  LY fitted  LY stripped jump range but improved Agility and Speed over the current Scout. As a bonus it would also have the DBS trait of being a very cool running ship.  The Asp family stays the premier explorers. With the Asp Ex having extra cargo and plentiful internals while the Recon offers the best Jump range around at the cost of its internals and combat ability.,EliteDangerous,cxjmf59,8,t5_2vi60

5886610,0,t3_3vv98n,Im sorry.... As one of the biggest defenders of Elite thus far Elite is NOT going strong and DreadPrtes recent hit contains nearly every reason why. Theyve been building the infrastructure for too long now and as others have said the game is out. Its out there. Its being sold just like any other game so lowering expectations isnt very helpful unless you do so for every game on the market. And I dont see anyone else doing that probably for very good reason.Elite isnt in a good place right now. Yes they just sold a shitton of copies recently but in terms of game design the game is a complete mess right now. Especially when you consider that its being sold just like any other game on the market. Im not gonna make the mile wide inch deep argument because thats a cliche and no longer means anything. Instead I point the fact that I started playing in Christmas  and had the same attitude you have now. Except now its worn off.Horizons looks promising but so did Power Play and Power Play is a terrible terrible awful no good piece of content. In terms of UI PP is just fine great even. In terms of mechanics it adds nothing to the game. Power Play was FDs idea of adding depth. It didnt work. And they havent even touched it since.Youre technically right. But Elite isnt technically inclined as of right now. So being technically right isnt exactly helpful.Id stress one thing though WE ALL want Elite to do well! Thats why were here in the first place talking about the game and bemoaning the issues with it. We see that Elite could kick ass if only FDev WANTED it to. And thats what keeps this community together. That hope. That knowledge that Elite can be better.At least we can agree on that.  Otherwise I salute you commander.

Its about setting by a couple of sprints to work on bugs either before settling into new features or in parallel by a small team dedicated to doing that. Its something I think should be done more but focus always moves to the next big thing. Its the same where I work and the complaint is always that we dont have enough timestaff.

For some reason your deceleration is much stronger if you dont have a target set. In some cases where stations are very far away from the planet or are just orbiting a star this method can save up to  seconds since you can go much faster for longer before braking. It also allows you to sidestep the max throttle until  trick.

5922450,0,t1_cxvwd7n,My point is random with rules isnt the same thing as procedurally generated. I might be wrong concerning how the term is used. Random is unpredictable. Impossible to foresee. PG is usually based on a Fibonacci series making it random in a mathematical sense but still deterministic. This is what makes it different from the unpredictable pseudorandom numbers a computer can generate. Thats why planets and the galaxy will always look the same when you fire up the game its deterministic.As far as POIs go it shouldnt be a problem to generate them randomly while still making sure that everyone in the same instance will have the same experience. Its the same thing as in every other multiplayer game the server has to make sure that whats happening is happening for all players.The generation of POIs dosent necessarily need to be in sync with the almighty seed. It just needs to check the surrounding area and distance from populated space and whatever else FD decided to be important for POIspawns. Therefore and this is my point it dosent meatballs have to be PG. its probably random with rules.meatballs  necessarilyMobile and non English native speaker...

High Stakes situations are good provided there are reasonable ways to prepare for them.If you cant easily lose your SRV in a freak drop off a cliff there is no reason to drive carefully. If there is no reason to drive carefully there is no reason for the planets to have varied terrain at all nor is there even any need for something like a variable speed throttle or any of that cool midair rotational thruster adjustment.And if there are no real dangers to your SRV there is no reason to carry multiple SRVs.Instantaneous midair SRV repair is not only silly it undermines the purpose of other mechanics and makes the game shallower and less interesting.

5949057,0,t1_cxzevc6,But .. how is that a compromise in any way?I think it would be a mistake to focus on player factions  a minority of the overall playerbase  over everyone else and make the other players feel like suckers for missing out just because theyre not members of some megaguild whose success was primarily based on the ability to recruit the most people.Not only do I contest the notion that it is only the player factions that are pushing their own story and keeping things alive I also do not believe that stuff like being able to displace any NPC faction anywhere in the galaxy and imposing their will upon anyone who stumbles into their territory is necessary to keep things alive and I have no idea why you assume that it was only player groups who were involved with UAs especially when the first ones who discovered them were unguilded explorers.The ones profiting most from such a change would be the player groups not the player per se. Indeed such a change could easily result in even more players fleeing into Solo or Group play simply because they do not wish to put up with a repeat of the Liaedin blockade. I assume you were around when that happened and noticed the controversy on reddit? That incident actually a good example of player groups pushing their own story certainly served as a wakeup call and a sign for things to come if Elite will move further into this direction.It could be different if the background sim would adequately defend itself against player group incursions or if Frontier would police player group activities and names and make sure they stay in line with the setting  but with things being as they are and the AI just rolling over as soon as a couple players stumble into a system I dont see where the fun should be for the ones who dont get to play with the fancy toys youre requesting for the big boys.I guess its simply a matter of perspective and preferences as even though I enjoy player interaction and thus Open Play Ive seen what unbridled player group activity can do in other games including EVE before both in regards to mob mentality as well as their names and claims and do not wish Elite to go down the same route. Especially since Elite as a franchise really is not about this sort of stuff and it is my sincere conviction that it should retain its focus on unimportant individual pilots and with ED small groups just trying to stay alive in a gritty cutthroat galaxy.tldr More Firefly less Command amp Conquer.,EliteDangerous,cxzg9py,1,t5_2vi60

Or if  tons is enough the Vulture. You probably need to sacrifice the shield cell but hey the Vulture has very strong shields. Against NPCs you probably dont need one. Mcr isnt enough to equip a FerdeLance or a Python.

Just because things make sense in your head doesnt mean thats how it is. You probably think the universe is heliocentric.Obviously you shouldnt rely on an automated shut off and you shouldnt let your temperatures get anywhere near the TJ Max. Your CPU will automatically underclock itself as soon as it gets near TJ max though.Also heat does not spread that much from the CPU to the motherboard. The socket is made out of plastic which insulates a lot of the heat from the CPU.Any motherboard that is not  a piece of crap will have temperature sensors on all the crucial areas. If anything goes wrong the motherboard will shut the shit down.Now obviously warranties are voided if you overclock at least thats what they say but thats mostly to discourage people who may not be tech savvy enough to do so from doing so E.g. You.

5999054,0,t3_3xlqyu,My opinionThis game needs some kind of feature that allows a regional search for items. I dont want to waste a hours or days traveling system to system and station to station to find a solitary piece of hardware when i could instead be playing and having fun.Realistically some knowledge of item availability should be known if only through wordofmouth of system occupants. If you get a new ship then then the search often starts all over again as only items equipable by your ship are shown in the outfitting interface.Such a thing is tedious and realistically such a lack of communication wouldnt exist.At the very least a method of storing station wares onboard your ship after you have visited them would be handy and make sense.Thus i use a thirdparty site to make up for the games current inadequacies.A friend of mines opinionUse of a third part site is cheating and takes away from the experience as it is not intended by game devs... i disagree with him but he has a right to that opinion.I find the lack of long distance communication to be flawed and something of a joke. Militarily how would they be able to coordinate defenseattack of the empire alliance federation if they cannot effectively communicate between systems. Economically Merchants and traders would need to be.... incompetent nicest wording for them to not even bother to store a database of trade goods in each system they have been to not only that but such data would also be quite valuable.Yet despite these communication issues we have these like galnet that seem to reach us regardless. Are there the equivalent of paper boys flying around in exceptionally fast ships delivering the news to each system?In the X games there were various pieces of equipment that would allow a traderpilot to search for the itemcommodity they wanted and for what prices with mods being developed  and several officially released in patches to further improve such features.In a game like ED it could be simply a piece of equipment that would interface with a regional trading network that would allow for the search of such items.I know i rambled a bit but when third party sites are a borderline necessity for a game then its time for the devs to do something and in this case its not exactly a new thing nor is it unforeseeable.,EliteDangerous,cy608yi,1,t5_2vi60

If your FD account already has ED on it you can purchase Horizons later at a discounted price so I think its about the same either way. On saying all this I do suggest getting Horizons  It isnt exactly standalone everyone is still in the same game same servers just you can land on planets plus you will have access to more stuff later.

Simulation simulates both good and bad thats what makes it fun and engaging to learn tame and conquer. If you liked the good and dislike the bad soo much that it makes you feel a need to change the game  the maybe perhaps its not the best game for you. Or you played it too much and just need a brake. Either way it points at a weak point in the game in your eyes but it doesnt prove that it needs changing.If you spend  hours flying the ship and enjoying yourself why do you focus so much on single hour that it took you to build it?

If youre a reasonable pilot please consider using fixed pulses as the Anaconda in FAoff is plenty maneuverable. The Cs are a wild card slot... you may prefer missiles or torps. I find the CMCs underperform because of their abysmal range... by the time they spool up the target is out of range quite often. The Cannons at least fire instantly and apply their damage quickly. I havent tested with Flak Cannons since the changes.Consider a A Fuel Scoop if you can afford one.Boosters can be swapped out for KWS if needed. Similarly can be swapped for Heat Sinks if you wish to run SCBs in your  and  slots. This will facilitate the larger PP which will drive the cost up significantlyI dont recommend chaff on a Conda even against NPCs.If absolutely necessary for your budget or jump range you can downsize the power distributor but this comes at the expense of a much lower firing time on the pulses. ,EliteDangerous,cycaqlb,3,t5_2vi60

6067754,0,t3_3ymsmr,The hard numbers are difficult to pin down. Exploration is pretty close to the cash turn in value but for older players who explored early before exploration payouts were buffed will hit Elite earlier than those who didnt depending on how much they got at low payouts. edit hit earlier in terms of payout not actual scaled exploration value which is flat  i.e. a black hole before the buff is worth the same to rank as the same black hole afterCombat is based on kills scaled by enemy difficulty. This will tend to correlate with bounty payouts but people killing only in CZs will have different payouts for combat rank than people working bounty zones and a dangerous player will get no contribution to rank from mostly harmless NPCs which still grant bounties for example and all we can go on is statistics for reported values.Trading is supposed to scale on profit somehow so that large profits contribute more but its not exactly clear if its sheer profit or not. The numbers in the wiki already came from testing. Further testing isnt going to help reveal the internal mechanics that much more in my opinion.,EliteDangerous,cyez18p,2,t5_2vi60

This nonsense of  minute fights between  Vipers has gotten to joke levels. Back in beta fights between smaller ships would last a few minutes and with larger shields and hulls bigger ships could last  minutes.

As a longtime player you usually expect to get some kind of loyalty discount but instead it feels like its the most loyal players who are getting slapped in the face and asked for another  every year.I think their payment structure makes logical sense but not really emotional sense.  The thing is that this is essentially a subscriptionbased game but its not really advertised as such.  Theres only one payment option for your subscription annual and if you cancel you dont lose access to all of the stuff youve previously paid for.  So in some ways its better than your usual subscriptionbased game.  But the fact remains that it doesnt feel right to be asked to shell out the cost of a fullprice game every year when what gets delivered at the time of purchase is only a small fraction of what youll eventually get in that subscription year i.e. season.IDK.  Ive made my peace with the payment system theyve got in place for this game.  I like FDev and want to support this wonderful nerdy sandbox theyve made.

Okay ...WingsGave the achievers nothing.Gave the explorers a new mechanic to play around with teleportation?  Let me break that for youGave the killers the ability to gang up on achievers and gank them in even more obviously unfair fights.Gave the socialisers ... not much really.  Mechanically it gave them a bonus for hanging out  if they were doing trading or bounty hunting but theyre socialisers???  Maybe it made it easier for them to help noobs?PowerplayIm going to go out on a limb here and say that the whole point of powerplay was to give the socialisers a reason to talk and the killers a reason to kill.Which completely misses the point with socialisers  they dont need a reason to talk if anything the real trick is getting them to shut up for five minutes and play the damn game.Socialisers dont need a reason to talk they just need tools that allow them to talk.And it even more completely misses the point with killers  they dont need an ingame reason to kill people their reason is a metagame one and in fact giving them a sensible ingame reason to kill people is actually bad!  Because it makes it easier for the victim to understand.  The more random and pointless and unfair the ganking is the saltier the tears.Powerplay has been watered down a lot since its initial inception IIRC.  I seem to recall that only a small handfull top  per power? of commanders were going to get tier  for instance and the tiers were going to be based on where your efforts fell compared to all the other commanders pledged to that one power.Im not sure if thats good for achievers or bad for achievers some will like the shiny trophy and just want to get it as quickly and easily as possible whereas others will only value the trophy if they had to work for it???Long Range SmugglingHonestly I cant remember what the big selling point for . was.

6129866,0,t3_3zai6o,Strange Skies     Im dropping out of another jump now. A star explodes into view. Its a white star pale as a ghost. These stars burn hot yet look so cold.   Ive been out here too long. I dont know what that is. How can you know what too long is if youre not in the Right Time?   I often worry if Im in the Right Time or not. The Frame Shift Drive works by bending Time like plastic. If you want to hustle it shoots you into a realm where Time and Space have no meaning. Whats to say when you get out youre in the Right Time?    I dont trust my Diamondbacks instruments. Whats their point of reference?  The clock is an ancient relic from when mankinds point of reference was his cradle. Ancient by our standards but nothing to the stars. I know Im in the Right Space at least because I can see the star.The white star expands on my screen. My body is warming up. Im flying too close.  WARNING  TAKING HEAT DAMAGE says the computerized voice in my cockpit.   Moisture diffused from my flight suit heats into steam. My panels spark. Alarm klaxons sound. Cold jets of mist spray on my skin from inside my suit. I pull up and away. Fans churn in my cockpit sucking the heat into my ships redhot radiators.   Everybody wants to sell you something. Everybody needs a dirty problem handled. I want to get away alone. Somewhere to experience purity. Mankinds highest calling lays out here exploration.   Strange skies beckon. Rainbows of fiery orbs millions of miles wide. Nebulae that paint the sky blood red.  Shimmering rings of ice reflected in the light of a burning star. Itll be summarized into little numbers on some astrophysicist geeks readout if I get home.   I twist my head and flick up the astrogation panel. I push a button to initiate a discovery scan. The scan sounds like a crashing wave rising in pitch. It climaxes into a foghorn that shakes your bowels. When it goes quiet I listen.   The planets have a song. Metallic whirs rustling leaves and bubbling water. You can hear it if you have ears. They sing to me. I hear one now. Wind rustling through alien trees a sound like chirping birds. A Terrestrial Im sure of it.Who sings to me? Theres no sound in space. Ive been out here too long.    I twist my flight stick and plot an intercept course. The engine hums and my Drive accelerates me past the speed of light.  Accelerates me not through space through Time.I reach the planet two minutes later.  Thats two minutes by my Time which is a meaningless concept.    The Terrestrial looks like a glowing sapphire suspended in a sky of unfamiliar diamonds. Green and amber landmasses dot the surface flecked by white cloud. The beauty takes my breath away. I want to stay. Maybe someone is down there. Something is down there something that sings to me.    I want to stay awhile with this Terrestrial but Im twenty thousand light years away from home. I need to get home in Time. If I dont make it in the Right Time no one will remember who I am. No one will be waiting for me to get back.    Dont stay out too long they say. The void does something to you. Maybe its a side effect of too many jumps. Maybe its just crushing loneliness. In port they call it Space Madness.  I dont know what that is. Ive been out here too long.,EliteDangerous,cymehfp,5,t5_2vi60

6134558,0,t1_cymut92,Well the reason they did PP is because they barely made their kickstarter and there was no way of knowing prelaunch if ED was going to be a sustainable success. Frontier must have figured they wouldnt have the funds for servers that simulate player dynamics so they compromised by having only a few core servers for persistancegalaxy simulation and the rest would be PP.Hopefully theyll take some time to reimplement the code to use a far more stable server architecture  the earlier the better imo. But thats why they went the way they did. The way it is now is going to wreck any future features involving player interaction by nature of the PP implementation.Personally I just play Solo mode at this point but I would play Open mode if it felt more stable.,EliteDangerous,cymxnva,2,t5_2vi60

6185281,0,t1_cysnx1w,You cant experiment to that extreme in an online game or else you kill your game AND franchise. Again they need to play it smart and follow the history and not repeat such mistakes. Its better to add factions and PVP rather than give players control of ANYTHING.And you DO want EVE. Player controlled areas and economy is exactly what EVE is and look at the mess that it is. Giving players the option to run things is terrible.As for Robigo odds are you didnt instance in with them because of the shitty PP system that they have implemented. And whats to stop me? The fact that I have  ship and they have many. A corvette is not so amazing it can take down a fleet of eagles vultures and other fast fighters. Again add factions and PVP dont let players control shit players are retarded trollish and abusive as we see in other similar games. There is way more options to give players than control give players control is not necessary to make the game or PVP fun. They just need to give incentive. Yes the game lacks incentive BUT the Give players control of everything or else it sucks is a weak argument. ,EliteDangerous,cyspaef,1,t5_2vi60

6293099,0,t3_41p9q5,Normally Id say yes to something like this. But imagine using it in a reallife scenario. Personally all I see is me putting full pips to SYS and not changing them back because I almost always stay in SC when exploring. No I like SYS being limited only to shields and countermeasures. Why? Well because those are related to combatflying which is what the pip system was designed for and is best suited for.Heres my suggestion. Allow us to overclock modules like discovery scanners and other instruments with appropriate costs like decreased power output while active increased heat output etc. All you would need is a small option to tick in the module pane that would toggle OC mode where compatible perhaps only certain ratings of modules would be OCcompatible. So in the case of a discovery scanner when overclocked itll scan objects far faster basic  intermediate could get a range boost as well but passively generate heat while in use and use more power when deployed. The power wont be a problem for most unless youve packed your ship with modules and weapons which most efficient explorers dont do but the heat might catch one by surprise if they start scanning an object while too close to a star...

You dont lose any money in outfitting as you can sell the systems back for the same value. Before you buy a new ship downgrade all of your equipment as much as possible because you DO lose  value when selling a ship. As for how long depends on luck but you could probably get a Cobra in a few hours time.For landing you can fit a docking computer but it takes up an internal slot better used for useful equipment.

6331714,0,t3_42b2j7,I have been doing a lot of refitting over the last couple days trying to find a solid CZ loadout for my Corvette then refitting to join a friend in a RES then stripping it down and trying the same things on my Anaconda for comparison.Watching the hardpoints is killing me. Not having any idea about whether my loadout will even work is frustrating. Not being able to see stats at a glance is a pain in the ass.I want outfitting to work kinda like it does in Coriolis let me select all of the things I want from an easy designedforpc interface give me all of the stats on what I have selected and then let me hit Apply to do it all at once when I am ready.I shouldnt need coriolis to experiment.Further if the current station doesnt have the part how about letting me search for nearby stations that do? Maybe limit it to Ly or something. But holy crap is it a pain when you need something specific and your station doesnt have it. Even if you know the good outfitters there is no guarantee you wont have to visit  systems to find what you want.Thats concrete and it frustrates me to no end.I also agree with the general sentiment here There is a lot of Respond to forum comments or reddit until I have a reason to touch the controls again.

6347567,0,t1_czb34tz,I think this is getting a little confused first you claimgt we fight outnumbered all the time against other PvP groups and win but nobody talks about it when SDC kicks their ass unless it was us ganking themThen you saygt I mean I wouldnt know because in order to post about it it would have to actually happen first.Anyway ...gt I never said we always do elaborate RP for everything but I believe I did suggest when we do RP people write it off such as you did even after admitting it was goodThis isnt quite what I meant allow me to clarify. Your RP in this thread was very good and explained the whole barnacle head situation in a way that made the whole situation easily understood. I havent written that off in the least and Ive already said I agree with your reasoning. I think meddling with these artifacts and shooting at them to sell off the metaalloys is a bad idea I even support your defense of them.However your efforts as an SDC member appear to be the rare exception. And this is the point I still dont seem to have gotten across yet.You see I went to Obsidian Orbital. I spend a fair amount of time exploring and am still a relatively new player. I fired up the game and thought hey lets go have a look at ObsidianAnts station I heard they added it I like his videos and Ive not yet been to a station thats been added in that way before.So off I went. During docking a nonSDC player warned me that there were some griefers around. After I docked successfully the situation became clear. Without writing a book heres how it wentMe Cool Ive never seen as many players as this! Whats going on here what are you guys up to?SDC incoherent threats and babbling garbled link to slightly more coherent just posted Reddit page copy and paste war criesEveryone else They are dickheads they will shoot you on sight regardless of what they say. plus some actually useful explanation of the barnacle thingreads some of the Reddit post already it is full of people calling them out on RP as a flimsy excuse to be spacedickheadsMe I just came here to check this place out otherwise Im uninvolved I have no cargo nor the ability to collect the stuff youre on about and I dont know any of you guys but I guess Im about to see what the situation is. Im going to leave the station now.clears docking hatch BANG BANG FUCKING INSTA DEAD You were killed by a player you have seen reported several times on Reddit as a falseflagger and general shithead who throughout all the above was completely silent.SDC various thoroughly tired expressions of victory most often seen from year olds on CODMe Well I guess everyone on Reddit and everyone here ingame who isnt related to the SDC were absolutely right and it only cost me a fairly insignificant rebuy to confirm it for myself.I already pretty much knew what was going to happen anyway I just wanted it confirmed. I also accurately predicted their limited attention span and made it out of there successfully in open mode.So yeah while you may be relatively articulate dick waving send you all to the rebuy screen aside you say youre good at PvP I get it already my point is that your group as a whole is not and everybody here knows it. Furthermore the ingame RP is zeroeffort if at all and bears no similarity to your comments above. Why even bother pretending?So that leaves us with my whole point to begin with  the only RP that SDC seem capable of carrying out is spacedickheads and no amount of effort from the few members therein who can string a sentence together without sounding prepubescent is going to change that. If you wanna continue RPing as the Space Dickhead Crew then good luck have fun its a legitimate playstyle and I have no beef with that but dont dress it up to be something its clearly not as any claim to the contrary just implies youve sorely underestimated the intelligence and perceptive abilities of everyone else playing the game.,EliteDangerous,czb5bnf,1,t5_2vi60

The Interdictor should at least be buffed to Farragut levels as is there is pretty much zero reasons for the Majestic to pop up all it does is make a laser light show and break immersion with how weak it is.Capital ships should be extremely hard to take out they should be the ultimate challenge for player wings something you can take out only with a coordinated effort. Then all those people flying Anacondas and Pythons that are constantly complaining how boring Combat Zones and RES sites become as soon as they get themselves a Vulture would actually have a challenge... and it would gasp add DEPTH to the game something that people desperately want. Buff the money you get for eliminating the Capital ship say k would still take more time for less cash than farming in a RES and thus balanced and anyone who is not up to the challenge or doesnt get cash shots because the Capital Ship kills hostile targets so fast still has the low intensity zone which usually is only a few LY away to go to.,EliteDangerous,czbckdi,11,t5_2vi60

6351089,0,t1_czb6mj3,I dont think it was the perfect movie by any stretch but Interstellar was still the best space sci fi to come along in years.  Coming from a filmnerd sort of point of view there were many elements to be excited about.  We had a really wonderful score that was used to on occasion drown out the dialog on purpose to highlight the emotions in a scene and downplay the actual dialog and in IMAX theaters was incredibly loud and powerful as it needed to be.  We had practical effects used as much as possible including TARS puppets made out of stainless steel physical sets and ships the tesseract scene was a practical hallofmirrors set.  The reason you think the CGI work was incredible is because there wasnt all that much of it!The script was a bit weak with the love angle but emotion is the theme of the movie.  The writing was a bit cheesy when it deals with some of that but I think that overall when you are watching in a theater it comes through.

Some weapons are better for a particular task some are worse but how you can call it not balanced when everybody has access to the same finite arsenal is above my comprehension.

6380687,0,t1_czedja5,Your conflating two different things.  Scanning is easy.  Exploration is not just scanning.The process of exploration is a mixture of planning and reviewing paths through the galaxy to increase the chances that you will come across something interesting. I dont believe there is anything sustainable about doing exploration for money.If all you want do do is make a simple part of it more complicated you risk putting people off.In my opinion the most valuable addition to exploration over the life of Elite are the external tools such as universal cartographics the website and the various tools available to log and share information about what other explorers have found.  There is FAR more value and interest in these things than the money involved in exploration.Why do you think exploration imgur albums are so popular?  Once you answer that question to your personal satisfaction ask yourself what adding complexity to the scanning of a system gives you as a player.Now ask yourself if you are actually obstructing a player who wants to take goodlooking screenshot.Money is great but it isnt the primary reason to explore surely.  If youre want money there are better things to do.,EliteDangerous,czewzbb,1,t5_2vi60

6399275,0,t1_czh0aek,I friend of mine started playing recently and had a few issues from the start. There is no get to know the game mechanics missions at the start. You given a ship and off you go. It takes a while to get used to how the game works. And much of how it works is not explained in game. As for grifiers I have been playing for over a year and been randomly killed like about six times. This is in no warning not on opposite side in a warzone. But then a gain murderer is a possible vocation in the game if you really want. But because space is so big finding other players is not that common so finding one that just wants to kill you is quite rare. Being wealthy does not make this game better in fact I have much more fun in smaller ships then the larger ones. What jobs are most profitable changes often usually when a patch buffsnerfs different areas. But its much better to find an area you have fun and do that. If you just chase the most profitable way but happen to find it dull change shipjob or you will find the game becomes a chore.  ,EliteDangerous,czh15q3,2,t5_2vi60

6433434,0,t3_43r31r,Yes very much so but it has to be located in game easily accessible and not in a separate queue or menu and have one single location of congregation or assembly.  CQC Queue is empty because its completely separate from the remainder of the game.  No one wants to stop space trucking in order to sit in a queue for  minutes and not get a match.  Its also immersion breaking having to exit the game in order to log in to a separate game that is the same game.The races have to take place in a single queue in a single location in the galaxy otherwise players will be waiting in different space stations hoping someone else will show up.  Theres also the obvious minor barrier of needing enough cash to buy a racing ship and replace it when you inevitably crash.  Most people here likely have enough money to crash hundreds of thousands of race eagles but if it was an official game mode it would be just as easy to provide the player with a selection of free vehicles to race in either way the cash payouts for the activity should more than cover the cost of an occasional blow up.  If players are being rewarded appropriately for time spent at the races money should be no issue.  We could even be sponsored by patrons and never use our own ships for it.  Unfortunately the only way I see it happening with short queues that dont stop players from continuing to play the regular game they would have to allow us to queue on the fly anywhere in the galaxy and when a match starts you get pulled out of the normal universe and dropped into a separate racing instance for the duration of the race paid out then dropped back into regular space.  This would obviously be intensely immersion breaking some people would hate that but they do the same thing in grand theft auto and its amazing.,EliteDangerous,czkr72p,2,t5_2vi60

If you get the orginal game at half price during a sale that means you can get both at the same price anyway. Ill show you how belowOrignal price of base game Horizons Cost of horizons after purchasing base game Half price base game So therefore if you get the base game at half price and then buy Horizons you arent paying any extra and you can check if you like the game at a quarter of Horizons then if you want to you can buy Horizons. ,EliteDangerous,czktyc9,2,t5_2vi60

6448097,0,t3_43zzwj,Its all part of the game of flying.You have to think about gravity wells. Like said in other comments stick your speed into the blue section and aim for about  seconds on the indicator. That is the basics.The more you play the more you can improve. For example bigger ships deaccelerate slower and thus you have to brake earlier or else overshoot. If the station is on the front side of the planet then you have an easy approach. If on the back then you will be dragged back by gravity and you will have a slow but safer deal. However  you can learn to floor it and pass through the gravity well and use the deceleration to speed up your journey. And so on.You probably find that when you approach a planet you are fine in your blue zone and then right at the end it suddenly flies off the scale and you fly right on by. That is the planet pulling you in and so you need to decelerate earlier.Another trick I like is when you hit the last few mm then you floor the pedal to the metal. Once you are below km s then you are ok to disengage and full power will not take you back above that mark. So you may as well punch it and shave off a few seconds from journey. ,EliteDangerous,czm9ul1,3,t5_2vi60
6449373,0,t1_czmc2mi,Im tired of hearing the same old tired excuses for why a company isnt explaining why their servers went down.  Its the st century now.  Google exists.  In general the type of people playing this game tend to skew to the more intelligent side of the population forumdadcarebear PvEonly crowd notwithstanding.  I paid a lot of money for this game  a game that demands ones PC always be online a game that demands servers be up and running .  So when something FDEV manages goes down and prevents me from using the product I paid for I damn well want to know WHY that something went down and WHAT FDEV is doing to prevent it from happening again in the future.  Im a network engineer responsible for  servers and you better damn well believe that when a server goes down for whatever reason we damn well let the affected clients know its down why we think its down when we expect it to be back up and afterwards give a full AAR report on it.

6449717,0,t3_43xvko,I think the original rationale these guys had for taking out slave traders is all wrong from start to end anyways.. My ship runs shields which also will block solar radiation from reaching the cargo hold and thus the slaves in there. The longrange smuggling build I use does the whole trip without a single fuelscooping stop needed so theres no prolonged exposure to radiation in the first place. The entire trip takes something between  minutes first delivery and . hours last delivery so this is hardly a long or particularly gruelling journey. Where do slaves stand a better chance of having a even halfwaydecent life? In a godforsaken criminallogisticshub outpost like Robigo with nothing in terms of resources and wealth in the local economy but only huge warehouses full of slave storage space? Or in a more core system where they will actually be employed and might have some options more than zero at least?So even if I were to take this RPattempt seriously the argument breaks down immediately.

6452844,0,t1_czmqif8,. Fair point but I would prefer that as visual feedback compared to a disappearing ship.. Legitimate crashes and disconnects do happen but on such high comparative numbers to Combat Loggers to also reach a threshold enough for FDev Support to take notice?. FDev Support manually examining the contexts of submitted Combat Logging evidence tickets is almost certainly more timeconsuming.. Yes in the UK and EU the revoking of access to a game is difficult however access to character accounts are not.  FDev can simply wipe the account back to square one.  Also legally allowed is permashadowbanning a CMDR.  The only recourse for the shadown banned CMDR would be a smallclaimscourt which theyd promptly lose following the submitting of evidence regarding cheatingexploits.   lost.  Cheaper just to buy a new copy.. In the context of a small number of occasions yes but in the grander scheme a repeat Combat Logger would tally up dozens of Red Wakes.

However there arent really any newtonian physics in the game and the developers have stated that they dont want to add the complication of physics to the simulator.So for example while gravity is sort of implemented you couldnt do something like place your ship in a stable orbit as that would require a correct implementation.Then when in frameshift the game seems to implement antinewtonian physics where flying towards a stellar mass actually causes the ship to slow down rather than speed up towards it.i doubt the game will even let you get caught in the gravity well of a black hole.EDIT If anything Id say Elite uses Wing Commander tm physics or arcade physics if you will.,EliteDangerous,cznaksb,4,t5_2vi60

6465721,0,t1_czlpbrr,I hope they do but I dont know how theyre going to do it. Walking inside a ship in FPS mode while the ship is moving around in space is a completely crazy challenge since you have to take into account... thousands of parameters per microsecond. Where is the ship in space? Where is it moving? Is it rotating? Pitching? Is something going to hit it and make it move somehow thus bumping the people inside it too? Now you have to take into account the positions of each person their shots and where theyre shooting etc.The only other game that tries to do that is SC and the result is... underwhelming so far. The FPS mode in stations is OK but inside a ship you often clip through the walls and end up lost in space forever. You shoot that guy you see but because of  microseconds of lag and since the ship is moving at  ms hes actually not here at all anymore.So yeah... I really hope FDev can do it but if they manage to do it right I want to know how they did it because its a completely colossal undertaking. ,EliteDangerous,czo3mub,1,t5_2vi60

If not for the missions the new player needed to know about how bounty hunting worked kill warrant scanning needed in an anarchy system bounty vouchers super cruise trading etc. Those are things I picked up while doing missions but alas no missions they can do here.And were ignoring the distinct possibility that the new player in OPs story probably only picked up Elite with the hopes of playing it with OP and not having to grind it alone. Maybe he wanted to get that Viper after the first hour then spent the next hundred hours chasing bounties as part of a group?

6523062,0,t3_44zd63,There has to be a bigger cost than just respawning or the grief potential will simply be enormous. Imagine someone just slamming into people at the station then getting killed by police just to respawn and start all over.Still I see your point. Despite having mil total credits I never fly anything in open with more than k rebuy. Nobody wants to spend  hours or more grinding their rebuy back  its no wonder that so many people wake out of conflict disconnect before they lose or hide in solo mode. Honestly I feel pretty bad about killing people most of the time. And sure people should be smart and only fly with enough of a rebuy but since when has the average person been good with money real or not?If were talking about alternate solutions how about time? Your ship just got blown to pieces it would make sense that it takes some time for your insurance to buy and outfit an equivalent ship for you. After all not all stations carry all ships or all modules etc. In the meantime you can fly whatever other ships you have or take out a loaner sidewinder.

These HUGE ships that look extremely sleek or just gigantic how can one person just walk in buy it then fly away on their own?  Youd think youd need a whole slew of crewmates running around to keep it going.  The Explorer looks realistic to me.

Unfortunately the way they left it it just feels incomplete and in a bit of a limbo developement wise.Im also behind those who have been saying for a long time that CQC should be free to play with advertising for the main game in the background of the lobby.

6648951,0,t3_46ng9k,gt EDIT down votes... I mean really?Yep welcome to the ED sub. You have been downvote ganked. There are a bunch of folks around here that RP as reddit douches. Serious responseIf youre looking for somewhat instant gratification hey nothing wrong with that you may want to reconsider ED as it wont generally come quickly. This game is supposed to take you a while. Youll notice there are people commenting that it takes them tons of game time to achieve whatever rankship they deem to be the equivalent of beating the game. I would have put the game down a long time ago if this was my priority.There are things that would take you LONG timeframes to complete but they dont really require you do it all in one session Exploration BGS manipulation.People commented on nonconsensual PvP... Dont let that scare you. The game is big enough that that happens in small pockets. Its unfortunate that one of those places is around the starter zone but just bug out as soon as possible and youll be fine. Anywhere else in the game player interaction is usually minimal and is friendly or they ignore you.About devs not listening to players that just means they didnt do something a particular player must have wanted. There are things theyve done based on player feedback that probably helped the game for some people SCB nerf and other stuff that kinda blows my mind why they needed to do it at all but its because they listened to players whining coughFDLbuffcough. I imagine its just that FD has a pretty specific vision of ED and wont make kneejerk overcompensation every time someone complains.Depth is definitely there in places but its tough to see sometimes like BGS  which is somewhat broken unfortunately. Powerplay is essentially a strategy game layered on top of a space sim. In concept its amazing IMO but is still in need of some help. Things like missions dont seem to have a point unless you realize theyre not really there to help your character as much as an interface for your character to influence the BGS. The game requires a slightly different mindset and I think people that arent willing to make that adjustment arent going to have as much fun. People will make the argument that that shouldnt be the case I suppose but thats the state of the game. Someone pointed you at an Isinona video somewhere in the comments.

I do wonder how Capital Ships affect influence shifts during a conflict especially as the Majestic Interdictor is absurdly weak for a capital ship. Only three rail drivers capable of removing shields only they dont seem to pack the burst damage of the rail guns and the rest is like an improved frag cannon.The  influence nuke is gone though influence nukes remain they just arent as overnight immediate anymore.

6684443,0,t1_d0ajibu,I would say that people in elite are most certainly playing consensually and should be having fun. No player is powerless to avoid hostile players avoiding those players is challenging and engaging and there is an option on the main menu to avoid conflict entirely if youre not interested it. Almost all of my favorite memories of the game have been those when I escaped from odds stacked against me because someone tried to kill me for no reason. To me the reason is always because space ship fights are fun and it just seems like poor sportsmanship when I see people getting upset over others not following their own imaginary rules of engagement. The whole point of the game to me is to do whatever spacethings you can and want to do within the rules of the game by joining open you are implicitly consenting to everything that may lead to. ,EliteDangerous,d0aqafo,1,t5_2vi60

6705941,0,t1_d0c95dm,its the quality of feedback from pvp. pvp shouldnt generally occur in high sec systems roleplay wise. New players arent given feedback in game on how to handle an encounter with another player. all they see is dying and an unclear answer as to what to do about it. We lose players not because theres pvp but because theres no feedback on what to do about it. Gotta understand new players arent likely to be on reddit or frontier forums. theyre likely to be disconnected from the community that weve founded that can provide this auxllury feedback.Heres an idea if youre a pirate or a reaver as id like to call those who interdict for the kill and not the cargo then send a macro message in comms to the player if theyre mostly harmless and below to a forum post about pvp and what to do about it.Frontier takes time to make changes. we can do this ourselves.

I think its a good analogy in this case. Parts of the canal are probably only as wide as is absolutely necessary in order to allow for large scale shipping although there are plans to widen the Panama Canal. Similarly Coriolis mailsots are only as wide as absolutely necessary to ensure that trade with the port is viable. We can probably explain this as being due to engineering constraints. Im not sure what sort of magic energy field stops all the atmosphere escaping out of the mailsot but Ill bet its not cheap.

6744041,0,t3_4812eg,The problem is deep. First almost all people we interdict run immediately. So weve been trained to need to fire fast.The players themselves are typically flying the best ship they possibly can. Traders do it so they have the biggest hull fighters do it for the biggest and best ship. Regardless people have rebuys that are massive hits to their bank accounts. Death is really just far too costly for people to put up with. Pirates themselves are given a K bounty for killing a player and costing them  million. Personally Id rather see piracyhunting pirates for more of an economy. Gimme more like  of the cost of the other players rebuy in bounty. This should only be done for players not NPCs otherwise people would just farm. If you raised the costs of killing players significantly you would actually incentivize pirates NOT to murder players. Players would have knowledge of this and maybe be more likely to stick around. ,EliteDangerous,d0gw30t,5,t5_2vi60

6831934,0,t1_d0qo4hs,Thank you for your reply. First of all what I take too seriously are real life problems and comparing your little misfortune to things like no job no money sickness etc. is a joke at best. If this is your biggest problem in life then good for you for real. Second suggesting I was a troll is insane but it just proves my point.Third you wanted to get some answers? Strange as I havent found one question mark in your OP. Maybe if your OP wasnt all crying and contained some actual questions things could go differently.PS. Thats how you format text.,EliteDangerous,d0qp7yg,1,t5_2vi60

Icame out of SC behind the station so I skinmed the sides instead of taking a wide birdth so apparently the cop followed me out there and the moment I slowed down to turn around he started the scan.

6832823,0,t1_d0qp7yg,its funny how i said the question is answered and you still have yet to answer anything. yes no punctuation good pointing that out but your just here to correct band judge and your judgement was wrong based off your perception of things. that was also wrong. also didnt call you a troll was referring to others. its also funny how people read things on a site thats for getting your questions ansewered and are still confused. maybe you should try and walk in other shoes for once and then you can see things from others perception. plus as for this game being my only problem would be the most wrong thing you said yet. since you so ignorant i lay it out for you. since your so ignorant and can only see things through your own mind let me lay it out for you. war vet with ptsd. biggest stuck memmory. watching a unarmed lb bomb fall on my squad member. like a tube a tooth paste. now i get to wake up and fight with my brain everyday until i realize im back in america and not in afganistan. i lose whole days. you think if you were in my head that missing punctuation and formating is my biggest worry of the day. i would say im envy you for being able to sit around and correct post that others were able to see was a questionits ok if you cant you dont have to be mad and answered it. clearly not in the right mind set over here regularly and now i have kids lieing to the gaming community about me. was just trying to straighten things out and did. now i commend you on all of your intelligence but if you cant take the time to understand why someone with PTSD cant think straight then your not as smart as you think. Any reply will confirm that. i hope that one day you smart and mature enough to see what im talking about. Maybe next time you correct someone youll remember hmmm.... this person doesnt think just like me. maybe he sees it differently then im percieving. you point is true i dont write all that well but still pointless because the question was answered yesterday but your only here to correct people. you have to see at least that but thanks for taking up some of my time and keeping my focus on you instead of all the blood and death i dream about and then wake up to everyday. ,EliteDangerous,d0qsuxn,1,t5_2vi60

Dual plasma can hit like a truck but you have limited ammo and really need to manage your power output. As for its shields and manoeuverability its far superior than what a lot of people say about it.The Courier is more manoeuverable but has lesser firepower and the Asp Explorer is a goddamn tank with machinegun points four light and two medium hardpoints makes for an amazing shower of lead if you use double lasers beams or burst Ive found shred shields fastest with quad multicannons or quad cannons if you can aim those.Edit Also six railgun Asp Explorer is just plain funny.,EliteDangerous,d0t9cqr,1,t5_2vi60

6897209,0,t3_4a7pdb,Youre ignoring manoeuvrability too though so ships smaller  cheaper than the FDL give it a hard time too   FAS Vulture DBS even...    Sure the Python is not a combat ship but at some price point youd expect it to start performing better than far cheaper combat ships.    Even as a multipurpose ship its niche is being eroded now.  Jump range vs the AspX and speedboost vs Cobra MK with low tonnage smuggling not needing large cargo capacity makes it less attractive.  As a trader Clipper is a very viable alternative and far better at escaping pirates for much less credits.    Personally i find it hard to choose over other multipurpose ships and in no way is it a decent PvP ship or even something to bring to hot CGs  thats just asking to burn credits.    Sure its still a nice ship and many still use it mining etc but the cost seems far excessive for its utility.  IMO.  I wouldnt ask for a buff as it is in an ok place but the current meta is definitely against it so fly it with caution.,EliteDangerous,d0y484z,2,t5_2vi60

That doesnt mean I didnt enjoy what I did do in EVE it simply means there was this other thing going on that although I didnt want to do it myself I enjoyed from a distance.I think thats what the CMDR is saying about Open.,EliteDangerous,d1isvgo,2,t5_2vi60

7108767,0,t1_d1lzy07,I cant speak to Diablo as Ive never played it. Most games with economies that Ive seen either come with credit transfer built in see games like ESO or it is completely impossible see WoT. I feel like the only real issue with credit transfer is the absurd amount of money late game players have. The best fix in my opinion is adding late game money sinks. CGs that take money and reward something else such as some kind of reputation or standing or perhaps rare weaponsequipmentwhateverthis would require storage. NPC hirelings are an option that I could see. Something with player factions as well though talking about that would be a whole different can of worms that we arent discussing here. As is credit transfers still happen theyre just annoying to do. Allowing for proper credit transfers would allow proper player set bounties proper rewards for player run events such as races etc. You could hire someone to escort you while you go mining or trading. Pirates could demand payment in credits rather than goods. Things like that.,EliteDangerous,d1m5nfi,1,t5_2vi60

7147941,0,t1_d1qkjrn,gt What exactly do i do with these missions?I dont know about the systems he named but I can explain the process for empire rank grinding at HIP  if youre interested. I got the idea from this postBasically its a system with a planetary base and a planetary installation. All well most of the surface missions at the base target the installation. And all of the missions increase your influence in the Empire. They also stack well.An example mission is cut the power. That mission says destroy a power generator. Easy enough to do. Well theres only one power generator at the base. If you log out or switch between open solo and group you can get another cut the power mission. You still only have to destroy the one generator but when you do you complete both missions.Get as many missions like that as you can. The timer on them is often  hours or more. I would sometimes check the BB when I woke up in the morning take a few missions then go to work. The missions would still be there when I got home plus Id get a few more.There are also missions like surface salvage and pilot rescue. So if youre waiting for the BB to refresh you can take those missions. Theyre easy too.A mission that increases your Empire influence have a little Empire icon on the topright corner as shown here Most or all of the surface missions at this base will have it. Completing the mission increases your influence by a tiny tiny amount like  or . You can see your current rank and influence on the status MFD. This guys influence is  at rank Viscount.When you get the influence to  missions will start to spawn that says Imperial Ascension Opportunity. You take and complete one of those and your rank will go up to whatever the next rank is and your influence at the rank will reset to  and you get to repeat this grind process,EliteDangerous,d1qnb9v,2,t5_2vi60

Do not rely on the colour of the star as TT class stars can be as orange as KM class stars. You can find this information in the galaxy map.Then just check that each waypoint after which you cannot jump due to the dotted line has a scoopable star and that should get you to the systems you want to go.I didnt know this when I started I relied solely on checking each system for a refuelling station.

7231810,0,t1_d200nwb,hehe when I critique the game it might come across a bit strong like I hate it.  Far from the truth and Id like it to be great.  There is a lot I like about the game that I think they have nailed particuarly the flight mechanics.  Whats missing is meaning and value and I find the PvE game dull and predictable.  In my view is the BGS including missions and the CZ and RES sites etc has fallen very short of delivering a rich and compelling experience.  In that respect the game is heavily scripted and it becomes highly repetative.The real strength of the game could be its players but at every stage there are large restrictions upon us creating emergent gameplay and player content.   Whilst I cant stand the mechanics of EvE point and click I do often look at that game and find myself admiring its dynamism intrigue and player driven content.  Instead we have solopg..Whilst its an impressive feat to have modelled a galaxy and see sky maps which are accurate to our location I dont think it makes for a good game.  What exactly is the point in having such a large space we can do nothing with and most of which will never been seen?I find it frustrating to see a game with such huge potential going un realised.,EliteDangerous,d207cbu,2,t5_2vi60

7233697,0,t1_d20e3re,Yeah I get that in certain cases. There are weapons that will deal far more damage in practise with certain ships but rails only require one slip to turn the fight. Add the RNG involved in module damage and things become even worse.As an FdL pilot I fear Cobras more than anything. They have the speed to dictate the flow of an engagement and if flown correctly even the extreme vulnerability of their subsystems fails to negate their potency. They can exchange rams with much larger ships favourably while remaining almost impossible to take out. They have a lower hardness value than the likes of a midsized ship but make up for it with a slim profile and fantastic overall hit points.The main thing with rails is distance. If youre up close they can dump cap after cap into you if youre flying a ship with poor translative thrust. If youre keeping them at range youre a harder target and their shots are far less effective but its hard to stay out of a decent pilots view. Lightweight very quiet ships and evasive flight work exceedingly well when paired with momentary weapons such as PAs and frags. The moment you give them a subsystem reticle youve usually lost.I always giggle like a little girl when I see somebody using multis or lasers on a silent ship  it just lights them up like a Christmas tree and leaves them ripe to snipe.That was a whole bunch of incoherent waffle actually but it can stay lol.,EliteDangerous,d20f2vk,2,t5_2vi60

The main firepower will come from your multi canons as kinetic weapons are good against hull. also they dont produce much heat.if you are great at aiming with fixed weapons you could switch all to fixed for extra damage.with this setup you should good to go to make some money bounty hunting in RES. should you still have a heat problem look that you upgrade you powersupply.

7369231,0,t3_3wxxew,A lot of people seem to be concerned that the current way engineering modules are setup wont make it interesting or helpful enough to warrant another player manning them.The way i see it is like thisSo far a lot of the things you do in game are minigames based around the core concepts. For example docking interdicting module management and so on. The way i think they would do it is in short more minigames.HelmWorks pretty much the same as usual. Maybe some of the UI is removed or simplified as other players are controlling it. Uses the seat you would normally fly in. Perhaps you can fire any fixed weapons too.Fire controlControls the orientation of gimballed turrets and manually controls turreted weapons. Either by having access to cameras around the ship and having all available turrets Turrets that can see in that direction follow hisher inputs. Or by controlling individual turrets.I would also think that the turrets have a lower thermal load either when being manually controlled or when someone is in the seat.CountermeasuresMainly controls shields. Using shield cell banks chaff and heat sinks. Could also as others have suggested control the shields in a  more in depth manner. Perhaps a minigame where you are altering the shields to recharge faster or be more effective at blocking thermal weapons. If you succeed it works if you dont  it doesnt. Or you have to maintain it.You could also have access to shield boosters on utility mounts. Perhaps being able to augment them.Same as the Fire control by being in this seat shields are more powerful chaff has a lower cooldown or lasts longer Shield boosters are more effective heat sinks work faster or dump more heat shield cell banks heal more shields or have a shorter warm up cycle.EngineeringThe ability to run diagnostics on systems without restarting the ship. Basically using the RebootRepair option in the functions tab without restarting the ship. Another minigame to fix broken modules. Could also have a different minigame to stop systems from malfunctioning. For example sometimes your power distributor will malfunction and randomly starts putting power into anything. When this happens the engineer has say s to resolve the issue before it takes effect.You could also scan ships without pointing the ship at them though i dont know what else you could do in this regard. Hamper a targets sensors?You could be able to charge the FSD faster with a minigame or have it produce less heat. Helpful if the helmsman has crashed into a star...You could also help reduce heat build up. By managing the power generator you could reduce heat up. For example during a fight you have access to the modules panel and are turning on and off different components as heat build up to give the helm and fire control more leeway. By being in the seat sensors have a slightly longer range the FSD drive charges faster or has a shorter safety cooldown. Module repair internals are more effective power generators have a higher heat efficiency and thrusters have a betterhigher output.This is how i see it being done. Everybody has a role to perform in the ship and becomes crucial when things go south. All of the this happens just by being in the seat would be small percentage bonuses in my mind but ones that do make a difference  especially in the long run.What do people think of that?,EliteDangerous,d2ftwr3,1,t5_2vi60

What we can and cannot post here does matter and I think you would have been better served by a vote by the subs members on this one since it deeply affects us all.  No I expect every little point wont be opened up for discussion but such is the change here it really should have been.The two points that are of concern is the no naming and shaming and the specific griefers.  Combined this heavily restricts what can be posted and renders the sub in sad state.   Larger questions remain about the independence of the sub.  Many use it rather than FDs forums because of the freedom we have to post and discuss stuff.

To limit goldfarming you limit trading so that one player has to be an elite trader and has to have good standing with the controller faction. Also you need to be competent in something to be able to rent space. Add a small loophole where you can give small gifts to new players.Suddenly its useful to fly with friends and to befriend new people. You can make money by selling super rare weapons from an engineer only you have found. You can help your noob friend with a couple of mills or a nice shield module. You can have a trading arm of your faction that supports and supplies your fighters.And so on. Pls Gib!,EliteDangerous,d2lu4yp,3,t5_2vi60

Just to get used to power management.  A cobra mk  is really comprehensive although the bottom two small hard points shouldnt be used for fixed weapons as theyre too far apart. Gymbals work well just remember to raise your view point so the gymbals can aim properly.As for travelling to a hub I wish this wasnt the norm.  The human bubble is massive and it should be possible and fun for anyone to set up and take a stand with a lesser faction anywhere.I think Ive got lucky in my adopted home of Frey which is close to some amazing civil war and warring states plus an Alliance held system close by.Also something Ive noticed is that gaining bounties and being wanted is or will be part and parcel of the surface missions featured in the Season  content.

7524095,0,t1_d2xewkj,Wait out of curiosity what do you think there is to do that isnt grindy? It seems that you believe theres a ton of stuff to do that isnt grindy in which case Id love to hear about it. This is what Ive found so far after getting back into ED. This is Solo by the way. Combat Two options really you can fly to Combat Zones and get a relatively small amount of credits per kill and get shot at by fifty bajillion enemies. Other option is to fly to RES sites look for ships that arent generally used for mining FerDeLance Eagle etc. or ones that are obviously engaged in combat. Find a Wanted person without a Wing blow them up. Repeat until need to rearmrepair. While occasionally fights are fun and interesting when things get tense most of the time even against Anacondas when Im in a Vulture its a case of stay out of the front pop Chaff if turret heavy take down the shields PA the Power Plant then finish it off with Burst Laser easy and repetitive. Freespace  has more interesting combat than that. Hell the game which must not be named here has more interesting combat than that. Not much else at the moment though. Though I hear the combat AI is being upgraded in . so thats something. Also Ive never learned to use FA Off never needed it against AI. Trade Find a station with rare goodscheap bulk goods. Fill up on said goods. Go either far away or to where the bulk goods are in demand. Fly between stars that look the same as the last bunch youve jumped between. Dock at stations that look pretty much all the same. Repeat. I hear the Euro Truck Simulator American Truck Simulator comparison a lot but in those you have to pay attention to the roads rather than fly in a straight line and read books on your phone while you wait and the destinations are all different and interesting. Repeat ad nauseum. Ill admit I havent done much of this due to getting bored within  trade runs using a Hauler. Exploration Fly between star systems scan everything repeat ad nauseum. Though at least in this youre more likely to either be the first to find something which is always nice or see something rare black holes. Havent done much of this either.Ok this is very bashy Ill admit. That being said I have been playing ED a lot  hours total  hours in the last two weeks on the Steam version though I did play on the regular launcher before switching over. I want to love the game I really do and all the things I have issue with can probably be helped by better combat AI and more interesting styles of missions. Looking forward to see what . brings.

No the travel time here is only going to harm your timeAre you looking to enjoy the game? Id personally go for it who knows what the system youre going to looks like maybe its better than the one you are currently in?

Decide whether you want to aim to use a bigger planet or a smaller planet.

Bounty hunting itself doesnt actually use mode switching and using it to pick up multiple instances of kill missions is exactly the same thing as using it for other missions.And no amount of refreshing allows you to get exactly the same high value missions offered  times for the same run. Refreshing a res is closer to looking at a nearby station for better missions though admittedly far faster something in no way similar to pulling the same good ones repeatedly.

7684741,0,t3_4kkhiz,I tried to express this kind of idea on one of those its a grind posts and got thoroughly downvoted... players feel pretty strongly about this topic so I hope a few people will read this and at least give it some thought... even if theyre still not convinced by your argument. For my part while I agree with you I can also relate to the frustration other players seem to have... I am relaxed about Elite now and play for fun only but it was something I had to make a concious effort to do. I initially had to fight NOT to grind because I think the game and maybe games in general have hardwired certain expectations about progression into us as players.To see Elite in a different light I think its worth considering how gated content usually works in games  Far Cry  for example gates stuff like the wingsuit cool takedown moves and good weapons arguably for too long considering its supposed to be a fun single player sandbox... but those things actually change the way you play. I think the real key point youve brought up is that none of the gated content in Elite is actually necessary for doing any of Elites activities and honestly firing a class  pulse feels much the same as firing a class . The mistake is to think Im not enjoying Elite but I probably will later once Im in a better ship  you wont! Maybe wanting to be good at PvP is the most important factor behind players grinding for uberships but considering the muchlauded number  PvP ship is not rank restricted and can be bought by anyone kinda nips that argument in the bud a little... also you only need to take a quick look through YouTube to see that really good players seem to win no matter what theyre flying.Having said that I do understand peoples frustration about the length of time it takes to get somewhere  and its true that the game can be a little weird about how it rewards players. I personally hope for two things on the one hand that people will make an effort to play the game in a less masochistic way and to just enjoy it moment to moment and on the other hand that Frontier will take steps to make this easier for people. I think its ultimately a good thing that people are voicing these concerns to FD yes even if it is in a slightly aggressive way because FD could and should take steps to address the inconsistencies in rewards and to make it so that you dont necessarily have to be wise in the ways of Zen Buddhism to be at peace with Elite.Im sure theres a million angles I havent considered but hey.,EliteDangerous,d3fphja,15,t5_2vi60

7691757,0,t1_d3gafrs,Well lets see the cannon rounds go at ms and at a really rough guess Id say weigh between  and kg each at class  so if the rounds weighed kg each cannon round would be felt as a kg weight class  cannons would be more in the range of kg if I assume they scale in weight the same. The rounds would probably knock a sidewinder a bit but with the larger ships weighing in excess of  tons they wouldnt significantly disrupt the course youre flying on. The thrusters of the ships seem to be easily capable of putting out a lot more force than that. An anacondas laterals are capable of accelerating it to ms without flight assist over about  seconds that would imply a force output of  times the anacondas weight for a quarter of the anacondas laterals. This is fairly inconsistent though as its not affected much by mass with the thruster force output seemingly changing based on your mass this isnt that surprising though as it seems in elite that your max speed is an artificial limitation anyway.Now all this assumes I havent completely forgotten how to do physics and I have used some very rough numbers so if I am obviously wrong call me out.tldr The cannons shouldnt normally make much of a difference to your ships orientation.,EliteDangerous,d3gi4sr,1,t5_2vi60

Yes most humans read top to bottom but most internet folx reply at the bottom because they have manners.B I said Surely you can acknowledge this is a request to not deep dive on a tangent that you brought up. Since you seem to feel its a burning question Ill indulge your curiousity with a recent timeline with reference material. FD announced a new expansion and season model for selling content they projected sales to investors. Their expansion lacked some of the features people hoped for and wasnt entirely well received by the playerbase. . Their sales reflected this and as a result their stock lost  of its value in a single day following that report.. They announced their first expansion on Horizons Engineers is on track and the stock rebounds half of that loss.. FD announces they cant hit their  date and sure enough it falls like a ROCK again for the first time being below  in .. Fear not FD reminds people that they support the Rift and that Planet Coaster is on the way! Trigger a minor rebound in confidence. People see sales numbers again not jumping out of their seat for this upcoming Engineers expansion so we drop below  again.I feel like the above illustrates them both brushing off criticism in the face of facts the season model is BAD and a history of not having features done at deadline time. The stock chart in question is here  . Believe it or not my desire to not get into it was the stated one I dont want this to be twisted into devbashing. I feel like the above is a better representation of whats going on than me posting old forum posts about features they never got around to.This feels just like Power Play a really really great solution nobody particularly asked for with the constants set to the wrong values.,EliteDangerous,d3m539i,3,t5_2vi60

7751339,0,t1_d3n8u84,The grind is a balancing issue which is easily tweaked after the fact. You have to make the decisions somewhere and removing the grind was necessary to test the new systems. To have the grind in place the beta would have to exist for much longer. Which is an argument I can accept.The bugs with NPC weapon loadouts slipped through because they were either only caught in an extremely limited amount of cases or something as small as a variable boundary has gotten messed up on live release.  Expect patches over the next week or so to address these issues or if they arent resolved in a timely manner then start stomping feet.All you can do at this point is submit as many bug reports as possible.

Aside from acquiring infinite mass and density at c and aside from the infinite energy requirement it would take to get you to c you wouldnt be able to see anything outside your ship because you see light which you are travelling faster than.  Lets not fall on this particular sword okay?e Just in case its unclear what my position is  OP is absolutely right that we should be able to toggle any and all audio and visual cues from our ship.

There is far more to it than that.gt What chunks are there exactly that you cant play without leveling up?Fittings accessing certain regions of space unlocking more missions acquiring the money needed to buy ships and fittings etc. Again this is all from last year though. It may not be the case today.gt And nothing of that was a grind to anything. Just had fun. The leveling up WILL occur eventually. Maybe not as fast as you hope it to be but it is still there.I just came out of a meeting that was mostly an argument over semantics. And I believe a semantic problem exists right here. I admit grind usually invokes negative feelings of tediousness but in the context of games like ED EVE and other persistent universe RPGSimulationwhatever games grind doesnt have to be tedious. It can be fun and engaging. A bit of tediousness doesnt hurt either but the rewards need to match the effort and I felt a year ago that this was just not the case. I have a good friend who absolutely LOVES Elite Dangerous and I think his attitude lines up a lot more with yours. He likes playing the game for the sake of playing the game and nothing more.

Now thats great for him great for you finding a piece of entertainment or art that really captivates you is absolutely a good thing. Me personally I would like to do more than just play I want to accomplish. If the missions dont grow my character or grow it very slowly then I just dont feel that sense of accomplishment. You might my friend certainly does but sadly for me I do not.

7834725,0,t1_d3wkfbh,The problem with that argument is that youve just created a lot of new content that is only lifeless menus. They only difference between the current lifeless menus and the proposed lifeless menus is that in itll say random commander name  instead of random npc name. I get that that in itself is worth a lot to people but from a game play perspective nothing would fundamentally change and it would be a huge amount of work to integrate into the game technically. Furthermore it would mean instead of players flying around doing stuff and then accessing lifeless menus it becomes just lifeless menus. Also Powerplay is one of my favorite parts of the game and something I probably spend most of my time doing in Elite so well skip getting side tracked into that. And I know FD arent done with the engineers yet which means we cant properly evaluate it yet and offering sweeping changes without knowing everything they are planning is a little reckless and naive. They might add different means of acquisition themselves that would invalidate the need for OPs post anyway. And no offense but I think you are looking at this wrong. You shouldnt be trying to  this game by unlocking the top military ranks with each of the superpowers allying with all the minor factions and unlocking level  of all of the upgrades of all the engineers. Its just not possible given the scope and scale of the game. You should pick a path and prioritize whats important to you personally. I understand that being able to buy your way through would make this substantially easier but personally I dont think easier is better or its worth all the content that players will skip with credits.

But I do find the minigame that accompanies it to be very gamey and a jarring contrast with the overall gameplay of Eliteas opposed to station docking planet landing or mining which feel like a natural extension of the games mechanics.They should get rid of interdictions in their current form entirely and replace the FSD interdicter with a large weapon that needs to be fitted to a module slot due to its size. It would be a FSD torpedo that is equipped with a FSD and is usable at fasterthanlight speeds. It would be a seeking torpedo but the target would be able to lure it into gravity wells to slow it down or lure it into other ships even the attackers ships. A hit with the torpedo would create its own minigravity well which the attacker could either successfully drop out of SC at or crash into and be torn from SC much in the way of current succesful interdictions. While rearming would end up being rather expensive with this device it could be balanced by making a hit put a longish delay on FSD recharge.

7990406,0,t1_d4e2avy,That goes without saying and is only the case if you have to spread a large number of materials over a small number of ways of finding them in a very simple manner.What I meant was have clear and distinct ways of getting different materials. For example different materials can be assigned to different planet types. Now you can get a  drop rate of polonium on planet A and a  of arsenic on planet B. Currently this is already the case but its poorly communicated and there is a huge random component.

8018074,0,t1_d4habpt,So your opinion is making the game grindy which is a fact is a good thing because the quitters are lame and youre better than that for putting up with repetitive tasks for longer amounts of time.  The very people who are unlikely to purchase updates liveries or spend money on the game whatsoever which is how Frontier keeps the servers running and the development moving forward.    I do believe your opinion is both elitist in a bad way and wrong.  I dont mind working hard at the game granted i dont run out of things to do to be forced into doing something lame over and over which is exactly what the engineers are.  A time sink doesnt promote skills or any kind of gameplay it just testify of ones ability to waste time which im fairly unwilling to do.  If you are then im glad for you youd make a killing at farmville i guess but this is not what i bought a Hotas for.    Beside the relevance of my opinion or anyone elses for that matter is of little importance in a reddit discussion i dont expect Braben to aknowledge my thoughts on the game and everything thats been said here will be forgotten tomorrow.  I just happen to take solace in the fact my feelings about the game are seemingly shared by others regarding the gameplay and enjoy exchanging ideas and opinions on that. ,EliteDangerous,d4hb0zn,2,t5_2vi60

I tried to reverse but Id not figured out that the handbrake doesnt turn your throttle down. Spilling over the lip of that canyon scared out of my mind plummeting into dust then hearing that sickening crash from the impact of my SRV thankful to whatever space god holds reign over this moon that I hadnt destroyed myself.

8171599,0,t3_4r6smp,Its possible in an hour or two. But from what Ive seen youll take a while longer because youre just not very good yet which is fine and to be expected since this game is not easy on beginners. Theres plenty of ways to do it so Im just going to use myself as an example and tell you how I did it. There are other arguably better ways but do what you enjoy. First I ran missions. Moving away from the starting system was important since that station is a long way from the main star. Pick one and stick to it so your reputation increases and gives you access to better missions. I soon found that I couldnt accept many since my jump range was terrible so I upgraded the FSD. I stuck to data transport mostly due to the stock Sidewinder only having  cargo racks though now they changed it so you can put more in it and the fact that the Sidewinder dies very easily along with my terrible flying. Smuggling was fun when those missions appeared a few hours later I had the k needed for a Cobra. In the Cobra I continued missions. I could now take on other ships in fights as long as I checked the rank and ship before engaging so I started to take combat missions as well. It only took an hour or two before I had some spare money so I decided to outfit it for mining and head to a ring. While mining I was earning kk per hour so after  hours I had my first million. Also this was back before they changed mining so mining now is much easier and more profitable. I used this to buy a Type. In the Type I did a bit more mining then tried rare trading. This was earning me k per run with each run taking me about an hour. Soon I had enough for an Asp Explorer which can do pretty much any role in the game without many limits. This made community goals easy where you can earn millions with less than an hour of effort the only thing is you can only do them once a week or so. I later suddenly realised I had enough for a Python so got that for trading. I sold it to get a Type for a trading community goal. Due to the massive cargo size it took less than a week  hours a day for the profits  CG reward to give me enough for an Anaconda. Also I really disagree with the consensus that bigger ships are better. They have more flexibility but theres often better ones that are much cheaper for specific roles. I rarely use the Anaconda and mostly stick to the Asp or Vulture. If youre not enjoying it by the time youre buying ships worth more than k youre probably playing the wrong game. One last thing that concerns me is how you said you spent  hours to do a k reward mission. Even in the stock Sidewinder that is far too long. Is that just an exaggeration? If not why is it taking that long? ,EliteDangerous,d4yzzmy,1,t5_2vi60

8194449,0,t1_d51aewh,Beyond that theres the technical issue.    Its not as simple as having a camera record. IANAProgrammer but a camera following behind the player would require that the game render the game twice once for your view once for the cameras view so youre looking at double the system requirements or youll have to strip down your visuals.alternatively if one wants a Replay camera thats a whole other bag of worms as it would require that the game record the movement  activity data for all targets in the system. I dont know if theres even a framework to allow this or how FDev would handle the storage and replay of this data.   So theyd have to build an entire flight log system before they could even start to implement a camera limpet. Not even counting the number of bugsglitches that could arise during replay.Now all that being said.

I might have jumped the gun on Evochron havent played in years and while I love Star Citizens flight model and believe is indeed superior Im weary of comparing ED to an unfinished product. I havent played Void Destroyer Ill be sure to check it out.The only meaningful thing I can add to the debate is that the term real in this case is very captious and should be used with care. We can account for physics naturally but in todays world no reallife flight model atmospheric or space is completely mechanic. Theyre all supported by computers to simplifyimprove movement and orientation. Not even car control is completely mechanic nowadays.I do understand what you mean with a nerfed yaw hate it and speed reduction postafterburn accel which would require the same amount of energy it took for the ship to accelerate oO.On the other hand a speedcap is something I feel I can justify eg. cars both civilian and racing have their speed and acceleration purposely limited because humans arent able to react quickly enough. Airliners could accelerate and get to higher altitudes a lot faster but most people wouldnt feel comfortable if it felt like a rollercoaster. Jet fighters could turn faster too but humans have a hard time resisting extreme G conditions etc.,EliteDangerous,d5hmhur,1,t5_2vi60

They have a nice plan for the roles and the different feeling of flying and I hope they execute on it.  It seems like theyre inspired quite a bit by the mixedunit strategy from large scale Eve PVP which i think is a good thing.  I do think that each ship class in Elite definitely should have a unique module that only ships of that type can mount.  Sort of like how the orca has compartments that can only hold cargo or hull reinforcement or ostensibly passenger transport with ..

And thats even assuming that trade ships wouldnt be running intrasystem arbitrage trades. The idea that a whole star system would be focussed on one economy type is a gross simplification but I suppose its one we could accept. So short jump range good thrusters needed. The ships should be fast though. They should be able to run like crazy and they should have excellent SC acceleration although Im not sure how you could achieve that with the physics model.The superheavy ships need a massive armour buff. Ive been saying this for months. But if a Python can kill a T with a class  shield and milspec armour in the time it takes for the Ts FSD cooldownrecharge cycle then that ship isnt viable as a trade ship.

Make it so that when the AFMU is repairing hull or canopy any hits to the hull or canopy count as damage direct to the AFMU so you cant just leave it on as permanent regeneration during a fight.  Think like an R droid out on the exterior bulkhead making repairs so if it gets shot it takes significant damage Interdiction cloaking seems like itd be a little overpowered especially since pirates often telegraph you on comms before they interdict.  But I wouldnt mind an antiinterdiction device same mass and power draw of an interdictor that gave you a bonus to the tunnel minigame ie you gain points faster and lose them slower make it easier for you to shake it but not completely remove the danger.Comms disruptor would just be a grief tool come on now ,EliteDangerous,d632sul,2,t5_2vi60

Using an analog stick or analog hat to control them if you recenter the hat or it autorecenters when you let go itll just keep you moving there at the same rate.

Its more efficient which will keep you firing longer.Remember that the Vulture is not a tank ship so you need to be staying out of the enemys firing arc as much as possible. Once shields are down just stick with the multi as it burns tiny amounts of power to fire which lets you maneuver more.If you have a mouse with additional buttons Id maybe rebind your pip keys to the mouse.

Secondly assuming there are no true griefers in Elite is naive at best. The game is played by humans of many stripes and you cannot be familiar with all of them. Thirdly the recent incident wherein players entered the Mobius PG for the purpose of attacking other players says that your assumption about PGs being the safe alternative is incorrect. It is true that the incident in this case also involved a CG game mechanic that unfairly put the attacking group at a disadvantage. That does not mean that there was no enjoyment of griefing the crybabies involved. The real issue here is one of insisting that everyone should play the game according to the rules set out by the loudest voices. Again all too human.,EliteDangerous,d68khf9,-2,t5_2vi60

8583662,1,t3_4xc3cx,Uh yeah another games success or failure is no excuse for what theyve done with Elite.Frontier STARTED strong and quickly fucked it all up. They had an incredible foundation on which to build future content which so few games do or have then just started rushing the shit out of content. Now we have several patchesfeatures that were poorly implemented and never fixed PowerPlay or had halfhearted and failed attempts at revival CQCArena and they just dont have the time to properly flesh anything out when their plan revolves around pumping out an annual season that has to have enough of a wow factor to trick people into paying for another year of early access features that probably wont ever have depth such as planetary landings.Bitter rant aside I do like Elite for the most part which is why I rant to begin with but I dont like how its developed at ALL. I think it could be SO MUCH more than it is and the development schedule is the NUMBER ONE thing thats holding it back from reaching its potential.,EliteDangerous,d6ejlc1,-1,t5_2vi60

8593463,0,t3_4xi2wu,Keyboard is fine but the default layout is pretty bad in my opinion so youre going to want to spend a while going through all the keybindings. The first thing I did was to switch roll and yaw so AD is roll and yaw is on the mouse. Then I inverted the pitch to match most other game flight controls. I cant remember the name of it mouse relative something? but there is a setting that gradually resets the mouse position to  over time. This makes it behave like all other flying games Ive played with a mouse. By default if you move your mouse to the right a bit youll keep moving until you put it back where it was as if its simulating a joystick but without the physical feedback to push it back to . This can make it difficult to control. That should get you started. Then its going to mostly be personal preference. I didnt like how the vertical thruster keys are over to the right RF so I changed it to WS. WS is normally throttle so I put the throttle on the mouse wheel and set it to  increments. Experiment yourself to find what works best for you. Remember that you can also bind key combinations if you run out of keys you can easily reach. Leave one key blank so you can use it as a shift key doesnt have to actually be the shift key. For example you could leave CTRL blank then have different functions for F and CTRLF essentially doubling the available keys. You can have multiple of these shift keys so theres plenty to work with. I think the main difference between keyboard and joystick is the time it takes to learn. A joystick is more intuitive so its faster to learn. However I think you can be more precise with a mouse and you have more button options with a keyboard so you have the potential to be better. A joystick is a lot more immersive and can make flying more fun though so again its down to personal preference and what you want out of it. ,EliteDangerous,d6fruvz,1,t5_2vi60

Before . seeing someone in Anaconda meant that he is an experienced pilot. Nowadays everyone can fly that ship within a week ! after starting in Noobwinder.Engineers brought OP modifications allowing to boost most of your ship stats by . I think Engineers ruined PvP. Shield is not an ultimate defense now making most of large ships dead in PvP thermal weapons are new meta cook enemy inside of his own shield serve with salt. It is not suggested to try fighting in Community Goal versus players of opposing faction unless you got fully engineered vessel with k shields many many heatsinks and modded drives and power distributor.Engineers however made some people go and do things they didnt wantnever did like mining or surface prospecting.Missions are good now just need some polishing.Elite still has that mistery around Unknown Alien Objects and thats getting more and more tense. Thats very good.And there is also Gamescom  where FD going to show us a lot of interesting things...

8639078,0,t1_d6lgdrk,When starting out I did data running missions and light cargo delivery until I increased the rep of a local faction to Cordial. As your rank increases they give better paying missions. So if you want to do missions and earn credits I recommend you find a system to call home and work for the faction to get higher rep. Or you can do bounty hunting in the Nav Beacon or Resource Extraction Site I also gained rep that way in a few systems. Scan a target and DO NOT ENGAGE UNTIL IT SAYS WANTED. After that you can try and take them or if its a bigger target wait until some security vessels start engaging and join in make sure to put in as many hits as you can. Also turn those vouchers in the system you hunted in under contacts. You dont get the cash until you turn in the vouchers so if you die before turning them in bye bye vouchers . There many other things you can do mining exploration trading smuggling pirating  but thats a good start. Try to do what is fun to you.

Youre talking about the transfer as if its a workaround for having to travel at all when its just supposed to be a workaround for having to spend the time moving it yourself. Otherwise why not just extend it to why should I have to have an FSD limit on my ship at all just let anything teleport to anywhere and give it some really expensive fuel. You go on to talk about making the choice of taking multicannons instead of lasers well if you chose a ship with a short jump range then you have to live with that choice in exactly the same manner. If you choose to partake in a distant community goal thats your choice. If you dont like it then maybe you need to change your activity centre to somewhere a little closer.The sole purpose of a ship transfer should be that you arent having to spend your time hopping your ship or ships back and forth across systems at the cost of doing anything else it lets you spawn a parallel process that does it for you while you can get on with some actual gameplay in the meantime.,EliteDangerous,d6qjqo5,2,t5_2vi60

8701795,0,t1_d6t43op,Generally it depends on a variety of criteria and a few things are easy to carry over from assessing an NPCs threat level. Like an NPC targeting a fellow CMDR will display their combat rank ship and faction below their name and those first two things alone are usually enough to quickly glimpse how much of a threat they pose.Granted given enough time and patience everyone can reach Elite but it can usually be safely assumed that someone holding the rank knows what theyre doing at the barest minimum.Knowing what ship theyre flying adds to that. A deadly Vulture or FerdeLance will obviously pose much more of a threat to you than say a deadly Hauler or Type.  Going further if youre not under immediate threat of combat you can get a decent idea of what the CMDRs specialty or profession is by looking at his or her subsystems and wanted status. A majority of ships can fulfill a variety of job specifications some more easily than others. If the CMDR is wanted has a cargo scanner cargo rack frameshift drive interdictor and weapons theres a high chance hes a pirate. But at the same time if youre in a system with a community goal and he isnt wanted and missing a cargo rack theres also a chance the same CMDR is enforcing a blockade or hunting for smugglers. CMDRs carrying kill warrant scanners are almost certainly bounty hunters especially if theyre flying ships that cant easily perform roles outside of combat such as Vultures and Federal Assault Ships. If someone flying a Cobra MkIII has no shields or weapons but has a bunch of cargo racks theyre probably a trader. But if that same Cobra MkIII also has heat sink launchers? That might be a clue that theyve been silent running and the lack of weapons and shields means they could have optimized their ship for speed by removing unnecessary tonnage especially since the Cobras known for its incredible boost speed even without engineer upgrades. All that sounds an awful lot like smuggling doesnt it?Other things can clue you in to their threat level as well such as if theyre flying in a wing the systems security status i.e. if its Anarchy or not whether theyre pledged to a faction and theyre in a rival factions territory etc. etc. Its a lot to take in and none of that even considers the actual mechanical piloting skills of said CMDRs! But by training your observation skills and paying attention to your surroundings hopefully youll be able to see when you can handle a fight and when you should back away. Hope this helps CMDR fly safe. o,EliteDangerous,d6tcv48,1,t5_2vi60

I usually just dont bother out of preference dealing with pirates is bad enough for me.I have also never done a Robigo run as when that was the big run to do I was in a FAS bountyhunting so I dont have a point of comparison.,EliteDangerous,d6zjh4j,1,t5_2vi60

SDC and others exploit that. Specifically targeting groups of players  such as explorers  is in fact greifing according to the post Ive linked a dozen times.Pirates dont just murder people. Pirates interdict ships for their cargo especially on rare trade routes. Explorer ships arent carrying cargo.

As a retired fulltime pirate Ive plundered countless victims and the number of people I had thank me for my contribution to the game even when taking their stuff was staggering.

Yeah I had a few people combat log but that number is tiny compared to the amount of successful raids I conducted and also tiny compared to the number of traders who survived an encounter with me.Yeah combat logging sucks its cheap and it isnt fun but neither is trying to fight overengineered ships with weapons that also make no logical sense in a ship outfitted for trading. You brought this on yourself with your dickish antics and borderline griefing behavior. I wont lie youre an amazing pilot and Ill be the first to tell people that about you but thats about the most positive thing I can say about you.

Then A Shield gen xA SCBs a few cargo racks srv fuel scoop and scanner.  shield boosters  KWS. x large multis x medium beams. All gimballed. Python is amazing because you can multirole and this loadout if you use engineers can solo HazRes pretty nicely. A secondary cheaper option is an A rated FdL. Better flight characteristics more like the vulture but slightly worse DPS than the python. It is cheaper and has way better shields.

8777353,0,t3_50c58e,Probably shouldve saved part two of this story for this thread. P Ill copy it here for those interested.He had heard of a pair of commanders who supposedly went missing while investigating the alleged alien mystery. It was just one of many rumors and tales however. Some people were more excited and anxious than others about the possibility of an advanced alien species right under humanitys nose. Some thought it nothing more than a wild goose chase. Some thought it would be best to leave it alone if they are out there and already know about us then it would stand to reason that humanity should avoid all contact in the interest of selfpreservation.This Commander fell somewhere in the middle. He thought that surely there must be something to the mystery but frequently reminded himself that people tend to blow things out of proportion and exaggerate. And those two missing Commanders bit off more than they could chew he thought.They had quickly become known as the Missing Two. The overeager fools were combat Commanders not cut out for the isolation and long distance traveling inherent in exploring the galaxy outside the Bubble.More likely they ran out of fuel got too close to a neutron star or simply got lost the Commander thought. Would be far from the first time that happened.Indeed he had seen and heard of countless wouldbe explorers overstepping their capabilities improperly outfitted for extended exploration journeys. His brief time with the Fuel Rats exposed him to just how much many Commanders underestimated the apathetic and unforgiving nature of space. Seasoned combat veterans were often the worst offenders in that regard. Their considerable experience in conflict zones inflated their ego and their confidence. They believed that if they could survive multiple battles involving hundreds of ships and major factions then they could similarly handle anything the galaxy threw at them.It doesnt work like that he mused. Ill take staring down an enemy capital ship over jumping too close to a neutron star any day.The Commander had since elected to join the hunt. He had been all over the galaxy from the Bubble to Sag A to the far end of the Milky Way and back. He had seen more of the galaxy than many commanders ever would. Despite his doubts and concerns over this mystery it intrigued him enough and provided him with a new unprecedented wrinkle in his exploration.At least Ill be looking for something a little bit more interesting than a specific type of star or planet.With so much experience even exploring the far and unknown reaches of the galaxy were merely akin to going through the motions. Rarely did the galaxy surprise him anymore. Or so he thought.After several days of uneventful exploration of various systems suspected to be related to the mystery the Commander arrived at Pleiades Sector ABW B. At first nothing about the system stood out from the countless others he had explored. After flying around the system however something caught his eye.Just above one of the moons in the system was the floating wreckage of a ship. The Commander flew closer to examine the remains. He immediately noticed glowing green gashes peppering the hull and various pieces of debris. He noticed the FSD drive float lackadaisically past his cockpit and saw that it appeared to be halfmelted.  The ship was completely annihilated but the Commander reckoned it was a Python.One of the Missing Two was said to have flown a Python... The thought made the Commanders stomach turn.Curious worried but still unsatisfied the Commander angled his ship towards the moon and prepared to do a brief exploration of the surface.If his FSD drive malfunctioned maybe he tried to land here. Maybe he was trying to flee from something...The Commander made a bee line from the wreckage to the surface of the moon. He slowly flew over a nearby canyon. Once he cleared the ridge he was greeted by something that made his heart feel as though it was jumping out of his chest. His eyes grew wide. He was as speechless as his ship was motionless. Suddenly he was able to piece together what happened and he realized he may have just discovered the fate of at least one of the Missing Two.At least the son of a bitch didnt go down without a fight...The Commander didnt want to stick around. The wreckage couldve been recent for all he knew. He set a course for the nearest station contemplating how he would break this news. Even if no one believed him all they would have to do is venture to this system for all the proof they need. As the Commander charged his frameshift drive the reality of his discovery began to dawn on him.Theyre real he thought. A smirk crept across his face. And they underestimated us.,EliteDangerous,d72u5u8,22,t5_2vi60

Rare trading involves going to certain special stations that sell unique items and taking them a good distance away to sell for maximum profit.

8819314,0,t3_50ybt0,Sounds like a lot of fun theres been quite a few suggestions similar to this though... and FD never even so much as commented on it.. Now of course this is a punishment read challenge added to criminal gameplay the game should also add a rewardread incentive for it. Crime should be a natural and fun part of the game. I also think that murder shouldnt be the only kind of crime that would deal with this system piracy should get bounties as well and so should smuggling. but both of those systems need a general overhaul anywayNow with all of this... we cant really ignore the fact that solo and combat logging exist. My fix would be that if youve got a bountycriminal level solo and private should be offlimits same with when youre trading but idk how to implement that. And combat logging.. well use any of the hundreds of suggestions that have been proposed in the past. Id personally just say that if you close your game while incombat with another player your ship just explodes.

8822033,0,t1_d788h0g,Do you understand what you are saying by claiming PvP is a core function?A core function by the very definition would be the central innermost or most essential part of something. PvP in Elite is not and never has been a core function  its simply a part of an actual core function combat and is in no way a requirement of the game since its totally optional if you do it or not. If PvP was a core function then its doubtful wed all be segregated to instances that there would be a solo play mode there would be an actual requirement to engage in combat with other players and there would be penalties for things like combat logging. So no one is arguing that PvP is not part of the game it clearly is if you want it to be the argument here is that its just not a core function as you define it. Combat is a core function but PvP is not. The whole point of Elite is to play it how you choose to play it and for people like me so far its been naught but exploration trade and faction grinding and for the record I dont choose to not do PvP. Ive simply stumbled upon so few players in my play style its not been something thats happened. But hey...if you want to accuse everyone in the community of being butthurt and claim youre right then thats up to you. I actually wish PvP was a core function and a more required part of the game...then at least it would represent the game the original teaser trailer promised.   ,EliteDangerous,d78acfj,0,t5_2vi60

Firstly that simply removes the advantage that it would have and trades a huge amount of space for better defenses.  Second the Type s shield modifier is fucking awful.  Thats one thing it could use just as a straight buff.  With an A Prismatic and all Shield Boosters it gets a terrible  Mj of shields.  For comparison a stock Imperial Cutter with an E nonPrismatic and no Shield Boosters just starts with  Mj.For having a hull size of  tons compared to the Anacondas  the Type  just doesnt even make sense.  Something that Frontier has done well with almost every ship out there is give it a role that it can perform well at the high end or the best with tweaking.

8858567,0,t3_51iucl,I like the general idea of HOTAS but the throttle needs rethinking in terms of forward and aft range for space sims center detent for stop maybe even make it recenter with spring tension more like a stick if force isnt applied and youre only adding or subtracting from your current primary throttle settings when pushingpulling off of that detent.  Currently no need for a split throttle head for space games IMO but might keep it anyway for future expandability obviously with locking option.Possible to do a twist axis on the head of a throttle?  Right now even the left hand joystick on X isnt enough for thrusters since you have only  axes but you should be able to thrust leftrightupdownforwardback.  With a twist axis on throttle head that becomes leftright while the thumb joystick can be forwardbackupdown.  Maybe what Im imagining is a bit more stick than throttle but with a Tgrip so the left hand is still usually in a palm down grip vs. a thumbup palm inward grip for the right hand on a joystick.  Personally I find most of the buttons on the throttle base unpleasant to use.  I HATE having to take my hand off the throttle and its auxiliary controls and hats to flip a toggle and a dial knob for blippety ???  Especially in a head mount display condition  need different knurling or tip design something on toggles not just different positions on the base to identify blindly e.g. with Vive or Rift on.  Better to have something like a mode shifter that lets the same buttons do multiple things IMO than spamming a lot of stuff on the base that require removing your grip from the primary control.The X thumb joysticks while nice also have button press options that are practically impossible to press without also moving the axes.  Need a shortersquatter joystick with a larger thumb pad or even a ring to insert thumb into to make this easier or else that control is much more limited for mapping.Joystick should have twist axis IMO....I will spring for a high end HOTAS set...but rudder pedals are just going too far.  Plus rudders and standing desks dont work.Give me at least one safed button with a flipup or flipdown protector on each hand for drastic controls like dump cargo or self destruct maybe actuated as well some sort of unlock on primary fire that maps to deploy hardpoints after which you can fire and relocking stows hardpoints.  Just because cool military geeky fun. As long as were just wishing here force feedback would be nice.

I used to stick to the vulture because it imo was the best combat ship bar none because it has nearly the agility of an eagle with triple the damage output so I could eat Annies by gluing myself to their ass and firing away.  But now that engineers is out I find that so many of the ships I shunned for one reason or another have a whole slew of things they can effectively do that they were just silly to use for previously.  Engineers really has breathed new life into the game and made ship versatility a very prevalent focus for me.

Transfer times of an hour or more are exactly whats being proposed.edit  gt The delivery time would be a minimum of around five minutes representing basic logistics of getting your ship loaded into a bulk carrier followed by an additional time cost per light year to be travelled. The ballpark we are looking at would mean a delay of around  minutes if you transfered a ship from one edge of human space to the other around  light years.

The idea would be more to prevent people from roaming around in LYcapable ships and instantly having their combat slowboat repertoire available to them. A slight time delay while it would add to the realism would more serve to add some degree of planning to your ship moves.I think  minutes TOPS. Its reasonable to assume that an entire station would have the ability to support the kind of jump system a capital ship can run so I dont think its unreasonable to to integrate some delay with that in mind. ships are currently in queue for the required witchspace corridor. ETA  minutesI would also hope its not a costprohibitive service eithersomething close to repairrearm that may scale with distancemass etc. I dont think k to move a fully weighed down Anaconda  across the bubble would be uncalled for.EDIT I just read ucfs idea for a more expensive expedited serviceTHAT sounds agreeable to me.

The only function your fsd serves on your fdl or vulture is to get you from one combat opportunity to another the fact that fsd ranges are shite on combat ships only means that you spend more time looking at a loading screen than in actual combat.What kind of ridiculous balancing is that?I dont buy it.Sure theyll fsds be obsolete but they wont be for traders explorers smugglers or mission runners.

These advantages include but are not limited to roomscale the controllers being included and apparently really good and the software behind the hardware. The Vives software uses its medium much better than the oculus does although that can of course be remedied by an update at any time. Also the Vive has an open software policy which just by itself makes me tend towards it instead of the rift.unfortunately Ive never had the opportunity to test any of these things for myself so I can only rely on information gathered from others which may be biased in itself.,EliteDangerous,d7eauwy,1,t5_2vi60

If someone starts attacking you out of the blue attack him before focusing anyone else because you dont want to end up with two ships going at your shields unless you have really strong shields. Be aware that at least thats the case for me the enemy you attack is going to focus you most of the time even if it was already fighting other NPCs so dont take on something too big for you. If you want to attack something bigger than you wait until its really low HP. As long as you get a few shots on it before it hits  you will get credit for the bond.    If you start getting focused by  or  ships at the same time wait a few seconds to see if they keep aggroing you sometimes I see  ships attacking me on the radar but they let go pretty quickly sometimes its just stray shots. If they keep on you  pips into shields  into engines and GTFO !    To flee efficiently go into high wake Hyperdrive go to another system rather than low wake supercruise. The reason for that is that for whatever reason your FSD will charge a LOT slower in low wake if there are other ships around their mass disrupts the device I believe.

8916824,0,t1_d7jo36w,I think Mr. Braben and those he makes this game for are caught out of place in our current era. This is a man who silently longs for space exploration to be commonplace a feeling many of us share. I dont just stare at the Milky Way when I go camping because its pretty Im imagining the planets in their details and looking up constellations on my deviceofchoice because space is fucking fascinating. Astronomy is fascinating. But how can we really put all the beauty and intricacies of space and spaceexploration to the forefront of society?Movies have been long considered the dreams of society and I believe games are in some instances filling that role as well. ED certainly fills that role for me. As such I believe what Mr. Braben is doing in making this game is far more important than the momentary burst of inspiration movies like Avatar or Inception have given those whove experienced them. Theres no new Star Wars or Star Trek league films being produced that truly hold the emotional and imaginary weight that they did when they were first brought on air inspiring the vast majority of those employed by NASA to pursue their careers.But as Elite matures and the possibilities continue to expand  e.g. flying through GasGiants where you can observe cloud plumes s  s kms tall  food for the imagination of those who can still dream effortlessly will be consumed and itll inspire future generations even further. Elite Dangerous bridges the gap between reality and imagination to give us a tangible way to interact with what were all so fascinated with pirating biowaste. ,EliteDangerous,d7jo6xl,45,t5_2vi60

First of all open means you play with other real players which obviously means there is a chance to be killed by a real player.  nd from my own experience and pretty much anybody else I know that has put in a good amount of hours being killed by a real player is pretty rare.  Death by player is also something that isnt the most difficult to escape after you have been in this game for a few hours.  Death by player also isnt the end of the world unless you are doing the whole breaking the  rule.Point being the open play mode is far from something that should just be called pvp mode.  That is hugely overexaggerated.  TBH I was expecting to have to worry about being killed in pvp a whole lot more when I first started this game.Even though I always welcome a game that has open pvp because it makes things more exciting it is pretty much the least of my worries when I play this game.

8995143,0,t1_d7stvpv,Ah I see what you did there.The problem with ranking up isnt in the missions being handed out but in the horribly slow rate of rep gain.Well thats one part of the problem. The other part is that the only faction specific ship that is significantly better at its given role than nonfaction ships is the Cutter. The FAS is good but the VultureFDL are about as good. The Corvette is a great combat ship but its not THAT much better than the Anaconda. In fact until the recent huge weapon upgrade it was more a sidegrade than a straight upgrade. Now its a slight upgrade. The Cutter is the best trading ship in the game with the Anaconda coming in second.So unless youre planning on getting a Cutter ranking up in the EmpireFederation isnt really worthwhile as you can quickly get a nonfaction ship that is about as good as any faction ship except for the Cutter.They either need to make ranking up easier to account for the fact faction ships arent really any better than nonfaction ones or boostbuff faction ships to make them worthy of the huge timesink required to get them.,EliteDangerous,d7t2rwr,1,t5_2vi60

There really should be one on the Clipper as the Feds have two ships with SLFs available but the Empire only has one. The Python would also be really well suited for a SLF. Really it would be fun if there was an engineer that could craft a docking bay on any ship with an available compartment big enough to hold the fighter ship module.Also the hired pilots should have an escape pod.

9024021,0,t3_53uyii,I would love to see a livery editor like Forzas.  Used to spend hours just designing my local teams logos especially the retro ones.  It was amazing what one could do with simple shapes and vectors.  But unfortunately it would be difficult to police all the dickbutts and it would cut into their bottom line.  Yeah you could have specific skins put up for sale but it is unlikely that I am going to drop actual money on a Homer Simpson Asp design that I could probably do myself given enough time and they are already making money just selling basic paint jobs so I dont see them just giving that to the players for free.

9050745,0,t1_d7zn1b5,Well since you asked I prefer a D HRP not a D because the extra mass isnt worth it....and it can be worth over  effective HP each against Small weapons fire.Also theres situational factors that arent as easy to quantify.  You have to fire off the SCB at the right time so it doesnt waste refill or get interrupted by shield failure but lets assume you can do that  of the time.  Theres also the regen factor...if your shields ever hit  on their own then of course they stop regenerating  in which case you essentially wasted part of that SCB because your shields would have hit max again anyway shortly after even without the SCB.  Youre discounting the passive regen boost you get for letting your shields fail...you get shield regen of  MJs for  min while theyre rebuilding to  and youre hull tanking.  And you cook your modules with  heat generated each time after you exhaust your HSLs ammo  which is even more of a drawback if youre trying to BH in CNAVs where youre already running hot.  And of course you run into the problem of what you do after your SCBs are all exhausted and youre running on underpowered shields.  Shields top off fast if youre in SC or if you log out in a BH site SCB ammo does not so if youre on multisession patrols then that can favor passive tanking.Plus youve laid out really a case for active shield tanking vs passive shield tanking...but you could translate that same argument to any other ship and just adjust the numbers accordingly.  Any ship can fit a shield generator and a pair of SCBs and pretty much do what you describe.  Heck using your logic every ship should fit out the largest slots with a SCB and use an undersize biweave because you get way more HP from the SCB than the shield generator itself. However not every ship except the largest can fit a full or nearly full array of laser weapons with an acceptable sustain rate reach a high level of passive shield HPs with  resists and fit enough HRPs to reach a respectable amount of hull HP and resists coupled with one of the hardest hull ratings.  Thats why it plays better to a Pythons unique capabilities...it does things that other ships cant realistically achieve regardless of loadout.,EliteDangerous,d7zr7ii,1,t5_2vi60

9052241,0,t3_545983,Well i dont really care about the beta or its price but your post really pisses me of because its wrong. So let me rant too..  Yes games with SINGLEPLAYER betas CAN cost for the player to get into it but most of the time its free and for a short period. Multiplayer games like League of Legends World of Warcraft and many more have Public Test Environments that are totaly FREE. Please tell me one game that will have you pay  for the beta there will be NONE.. Publishers do NOT throw money in the developers way. The money is coupled with many regulations. Dont get me wrong it is a good thing that FDev has no Publisher behind them because they would not have been able to finish this game but it does not change the fact that your post is just plain wrong.. Yes it is expensive to maintain a game but again you talk bullshit about the games price. RIGHT NOW it is cheaper then most AAA games but at release BOTH the game and Horizon were  EACH and THAT is much more than any game charges for its DLCs. In fact its so expensive that people wouldnt buy it so NOW its cheaper. Plus the average AAA Title drops faster in price than ED.And NO the Servers they use are not THAT big of a deal for a company like FDev. Srsly before you talk go and check on any company that is delivering the service. Furthermore ED uses a PP connection did you ever hear about that? They do NOT have dedicated Servers.Your reasons to buy and not to buy are spot on and at least that is right about your post but i hate people who just post shit without any hard example.

9103089,0,t1_d84gq1h,I agree on the motherboard part. Buying Intel would require a new one which might be expensive but depending on the games you play probably worth the cost. Also youre right having more cores doesnt hurt single core performance all I would never say that. However higher clock speed doesnt equal stronger single core performance The i  has a considerably lower clock speed than the  but its single thread performance is much stronger take a look at this chart  Thats the reason you wont be able to find one benchmark where the  surpasses the i  in an open world game. I agree that the only way to increase SCperformance on an  is to overclock it. But even then most of the cores remain unused by Elite and most games The Witcher  being an exception and still need to be fed with quite a lot of voltage producing heat which is not a good trade off. The xx series is good for rendering and stuff where you run apps that use more cores but takes the backseat in gaming against Intel for a reason. Im not saying its not a great CPU for its money but having tried both and playing mostly open world games I would not recommend it in this particular situation.,EliteDangerous,d861n0d,1,t5_2vi60
9104050,0,t1_d861wz0,the concept of a timer on it I think is ok and there is still a use for this feature. For example I have ships all over the bubble I can order all of them sent to my home system Ki and do other things knowing that they will be there when I feel like jumping into something else.However I do agree that the current implementation is somewhat lame for the scenario they mentioned as a big target in the streams having a type and wanting your vulture. I would definitely support a time reduction as in its current form I will only ever use it whenif I move home systems and want to move all my ships somewhere at  time.Further the current transfer prices leave much to be desired with the addition of a delay to the transfer I was hoping for lower transfer prices as they are it gets really expensive really quick. ,EliteDangerous,d865sjb,8,t5_2vi60

9156851,0,t1_d8cm134,To expand on this the approximate gravitational force experienced between two bodies is FGmmd or put another way depends on the masses of the two bodies and their distance apart from the center of mass. Note that this does not account for density if our sun collapsed into a black hole and didnt throw off significant mass the mass of the sunnowblackhole would remain constant and our distances between center of mass constant and so gravitational force would remain constant.   The idea that black holes are extra sucky come from the idea that you can get much closer to the center of mass of a black hole than a star because theres less hundreds of thousands of kilometres of plasma in the way.  Of course this is all with the caveat as you get closer the distribution of mass will change the way gravity affects you but by then there are worse things to worry about.,EliteDangerous,d8cp434,4,t5_2vi60

9166057,0,t3_55u07s,And part of the answer that has so far been missed is what procedural generation is.uWinterborneTE gets it mostly right  there are a series of rules for what areas of the galaxy get what kinds of stars and this is how you build a system and this is how you build a planet.But for the most part the details are pseudo randomly generated.  How many and what type of stars in this system?  Random.  How many planets?  Random?  Planetary types will be affected by the random distance from the star but their surfaces will be the output of random numbers put into the terrain generator.The important part to realize is that random is really pseudorandom.  The output of the random number generator is actually extremely predictable.  When you land on a planet halfway across the galaxy and drop your SRV on the ground the number of and position of the small rocks around you is going to be completely unpredictable.  But they will be the same number and position every time you or anyone else goes back.FD most likely didnt even generate the system you landed in.  They probably just set the parameters for This cubic xx ly part of the galaxy has X number of systems  Y with the primary star type of each system getting a weighting.  Your client then built the rest based on some rules and the random number generator which gets seeded with a known value.tldr  The galaxy with some exceptions is completely specified by a bunch of simple rules combined with random looking numbers.  But the random numbers your client generate are exactly the same that everyone elses client generates.  ,EliteDangerous,d8dv504,3,t5_2vi60

Each individual engineer schematic has a list of possible results which are then determined with a random number generator.

9335235,0,t3_58ad5u,I have all the important Gs now minus thrusters and I know dealing with Marco Qwent is going to be painful but I have noticed FDev may have made a critical error with engineers. By far the hardest one for me to get to G so far was Todd the godawful Blaster.  Trying to scramble around  bases in that horrible scarab on a tight time limit for firmware was just so painful. Lucky for me this was the last thing I left to work on because if I started with him I NEVER would have kept going. The problem is there are probably a lot of people who wanted stronger weapons first especially with all the talk of the current meta. I guess ymmv and you could argue that each engineer has a few requirements that are painful but my experience was that Blaster was much harder. I spent about three times the playtime unlocking Gs as any other engineer and by then I was pretty experienced with the process. At least the grind for G thrusters is for a mod that would be much lower on the priority list for most players. ,EliteDangerous,d8zb581,1,t5_2vi60

And what happens behind that event horizon is purely theoretical.A lot of the other things I mentioned are theoretical as well because we currently lack the technology but there are some pretty good theories on how we can indirectly observe black holes. The science behind them is incredibly predictive and has been accurate so far where we can test it. A few seem to be panning out like observing light emitted by accretion disks and the gravitational wave observations from LIGO.I was basing my statements on what we expect black holes to be like which IMO is how they should look in ED.But it is fair to point out that the current theories could be proven wrong. ,EliteDangerous,d91i0bf,2,t5_2vi60

9397887,0,t1_d9759c9,I commend your objective approach to the issue but the validity of combat logging is not ambiguous. It is a cheatexploit used to break the normal rules of the game. Mr. Braben stated in this very thread that it is against the rules and FDev does take action against combat loggers.Players who combat log do so because they dont want to face the consequences of their own decisions. They traveled to a dangerous system didnt properly outfit their ship andor did not bother to learn evasivedefensive tactics. They dont want to own up because they are sore losers. Their argument has no credibility especially when they have the option to play in solo which I think should be entirely separate from open play but thats beside the point.Pirates on the other hand simply want the basic mechanics of the game to be reliable. They want to know their target wont vanish after being interdicted. Piracy is a part of the game logging out when things dont go your way is not.There are tons of whiny combat loggers on reddit but Im willing to bet they represent a small percentage of the player base. Most of them play solo or Mobius anyhow so why should we care if they drop the game? If FDev were to implement some of the changes suggested in this thread such as criminals being limited to landing at anarchy stations then piracy could add an exciting dynamic to the game and could become a significant draw for new players.,EliteDangerous,d978y1h,0,t5_2vi60

9402382,0,t3_59egag,I think the disconnect here is trading does not equal missions. Ive been playing since . and had shit for money due to trading so I did nothing but combat to get a vulture. The shit money in trading was due to the fact that it was boring as hell. Im certainly not the best combat pilot out there but the runs gained me the funds to get an fdl and a trading anaconda. This is all going back to missions dont pay enough in credits. The almighty credit. Gotta love it. We all know this is just a sandbox that lets us do what we want and enjoy what we want while playing but ship size be damned if I am worried about my rebuy to the point that I dont want to try to take on and learn from a better pilot then it lacks benefit.

This would not have happened if they had let you fill more than one passenger mission with the same sufficiently large cabin.Also I feel like the Beluga needs a special size  slot restricted just like the other restricted ones. And we need an exclusively VIP size  cabin. And then dont just flood the passenger missions with them but increase the possible volume of VIP mission so that the size  VIP cabin on the Beluga can at least compete with the Cutter and Conda.But lets all be honest the Cutter is freaking huge and expensive. We probably just need cabins up to size  and give the beluga a size  restricted slot.,EliteDangerous,d9hq6fe,0,t5_2vi60

9567809,0,t1_d9sae9b,For most exploring the A will do nicely  once again speed isnt a concern and capacity can be refilled. If you were heading out to Beagle Point or circumnavigating the galaxy I might think about adding on a A to repair the A if it takes too many knocks but otherwise the single A will do nicely.Basically there are more useful things you can put in the slot like a buggy garage a passenger cabin cargo rack etc.  its good to have that option open rather than it being taken up by an AFMU that youll likely never need the full capacity of.Also bear in mind that an AFMU is not a substitute for careful planning and paying attention when out in the deep dark. Most damage is preventable such as botching a highg landing or jumping into a neutron starblack holewhite dwarf unexpectedly. Although between the new route filters and the data alert for the system being jumped into jumping mishaps should see a marked decline.Overcharging the FSD via neutron stars causes a slight bit of damage to the drive but even a light AFMU will take care of this handily just remember to drop out of supercruise before you try to repair it it has to be shut off to fix. ,EliteDangerous,d9sff0c,2,t5_2vi60

9645793,0,t3_5d58cc,To be honest playing solo has a definite shelflife. The game has a steep learning curve and plenty of things to master but once you do that burnout is very likely. It may not be a problem for many people because you still get  hours of interesting gameplay before you feel like youve done it all. But that only scratches the surface. To me the strength in this game is in the interactions with the community. Joining a player group or just being around other players in a CG really adds layers to the feeling of meaning and value regarding your actions. Otherwise it gets kind of arcadey where you are just shooting endless NPC fish in a barrel or moving inconsequential commodities back and forth for no reason other than profitwhich is tremendous fun the first  times but needs more meat if you want to keep doing it past .Edit What I did and what I expect many others did was to start out in solo until I had a good ship build and felt comfortable with evading sticky situations.

9648881,0,t1_da2a055,I understand your point about larger dev goals but my question is  why inflate the economy for the sake of longevity when they can instead add loftier goals for the more advanced players?Instead of making it X harder to earn enough to buy a Cutter  why not build a Super Cutter that costs X more?Etc.Thats what Im getting at.

9649108,0,t1_da1re4p,First reply wasnt intended to be second was. DEither way Reddit is an odd place. Personally I see the people who are all posting their own distancetimes as the worst people here that should be downvoted as they are the ones rubbing it in by saying how much further they can get in x time than you without actually saying if they support or do not support your idea about cargo mission timers. I see literally just  of the other posts reference it again I can only smile at that and shake my head at the internet.Since that doesnt seem to be popular around here I guess Ill follow everyone else and just go back to rubbing it in.

9652170,0,t3_5d6njk,Okay. First of all this morning while browsing reddit on my commuting train I was quite surprised to see all this wave of negative comments and I was prone to classify it as the usual whining after some FDev fuckup.As a casual player I have to say that I dont care a lot about the grind. I just dont do it I dont have a Conda I dont have the rank for a Cutter or a Corvette. I enjoy my space adventure in slow steps. I feel that a bigger ship would allow me to progress faster but since Im not interested in the progression but just making missions for my faction no matter how much theyre paid fighting against the Empire in every possible way exploration not a lot and following the various stories linked to the aliens it does not affect me. But thats me. I took the game in a Zen way.However I agree with the common feeling of these posts that theres way too much grind in the game. Things should be easier to accomplish. Thats not the way to keep players playing its actually a way of frustrating them and this sub today exploded like an infected pimple because of that.What if progression in general was easier but your choices had a chance to really matter? Like choosing to support the Federation makes that you cant access the Imperial ships?This is the problem. Everything is grindy. Getting a rank. Getting money. Having a rating in Powerplay. Mining. Engineers. Hell we have so many gauges that in comparison a cabin of a  is as simple as a Chevrolet Matiz dashboard.We need things to be easier. We need to enjoy our time in the game and not to feel it as a nd or rd job.If this is what youre saying well Im joining the chorus. edit because the problem is that even if I dont want to  cant do the grind I feel the grindy mechanics too...Edit grammar,EliteDangerous,da2tw8h,4,t5_2vi60
9652643,0,t1_da2acgc,And Ill say it and Ill say it again  the goal of this game isnt to just buy the most expensive ship.  The big ships are not more fun to fly.  The goal of the game is to live the life you want in the ED universe.  There is as much fun to be had fighting in an eagle that you can buy on day  as is there is fighting in a Corvette. Trust me I own all the ships I know.  This isnt like WoW where the goal is to level up as fast as possible opening up more the game.  The entire game is open to you from the moment you start.The goal is to have fun flying spaceships.   If you want to invest more time you can and you will be rewarded for it just like anything in life.  Rewards come with time intentionally and arent meant for people to stare at their monitors for thousands of hours in just a few months doing repetitive tasks.  Why are you always asking what is wrong with the game rather than what is wrong with your playstyle?  This game is intended to last for years and is designed as such.     I have absolutely no idea why people complain about a grind when there is literally no reason to grind unless you voluntarily decide to.  You dont have to like the game but hitting yourself on the head repeatedly while complaining that you keep getting hit on the head is just insane.   ,EliteDangerous,da2vzz8,-2,t5_2vi60

Go to youtube and search something like first time docking in Elite Dangerous and itll give you an idea of what youre up against. The game doesnt have a press X to land feature but there are those of us who really like that. After you master controls the main  professions have varying levels of nuance you need to learn to be good at them. This sub has some really helpful info and some things youve just gotta learn the hard way  If you like space and like video games that arent just QTE sequences youll probably like Elite.

9757598,0,t1_daflh2y,Your bit on gas giants got me thinking what if the mass of the target destination plays a role in the accuracy of the jump?Lets say jumping to a star is pretty safe and has a predictable bubble which ships could arrive but going to a lower mass body minimum acceptable mass would be say a  chance of a misjump and if the jump is successful you could still be left at a good distance away depending on the probability calculations which the CMDR could review first before jumping to weigh the risks and max distance expected to drop out.Below a certain mass threshold any jump would almost certainly result in a misjump and such jumps would require confirmation from the CMDR and could also be cancelled like usual jumps.In short you could chose to save time or opt for safety. Damage to FSD could also be considered. In other words Id like this jumping to be an option but not one that people would be likely to abuse if people could exploit it they would so there should be a really solid reason why they shouldnt.PS  This would also make jumping to massive bodies really precise such that the CMDR could aim to jump at a safer distance.PPS  Think of it like a projectile a heavier projectile has a steadier trajectory its more resistant to external forces a lighter projectile is more susceptible to being diverted. Instead of projectile mass its the bodies mass tethering more mass equals stronger tether.,EliteDangerous,dafuc0m,2,t5_2vi60

9810877,0,t3_5fqeat,I will just give a simple analogy.  Stealing is wrong.  Stealing should be punished.  There is no acceptable reason to steal.  But to simply point at criminals and say Youre bad now go to jail is never going to bring an end to theft.  If people are hungry and desperate they will steal or use other illegal means to make money.  The only way you are truly going to end theft is to address the root cause poverty andor greed. Look at every crimeridden city in America or the rest of the world.  There is a direct correlation between levels of crime and levels of poverty.  When poverty rises so does crime and when poverty falls crime falls as well.  So realistically how does one reduce crime?  Just put people behind bars?  No because since the poverty still exists theft will continue to exist.  You can put all the people who steal behind bars but there will always be more thieves to take their place because people who were once innocent will feel they have no other choice but to steal to get by.In the same way combat logging is wrong.  Combat logging should be punished.  There is no acceptable reason to combat log.  But to simply point at combat loggers and say Youre bad you are banned or otherwise punished is not going to bring combat logging to an end.  In order to do so you must examine why people combat log because the deck is stacked heavily in the favor of people in hyperengineered ships against which the average player in a trader shielded or not has no chance and this is not fun for the victim. I will say that again it is not fun. To survive they will combat log because they feel they have no other choice and this is reinforced by the fact that in order to make that rebuy back for the casual player we are talking about hours and hours of playing the game.  They would rather cheat than lose that time and money and although I dont condone it I understand it.  Furthermore these pilots in their hyperengineered vessels have little to no deterrent for their actions.  Even if players coordinated to hunt down these griefers the griefer can easily afford a rebuy and be right back where he was killing noobies within minutes.  This is why Elite is not a simulation in the sense that you mean it to be.  A true simulation would offer an effective deterrent to murderhoboing just as being hunted down and killed by the cops deters wouldbe spree killers in the real world.  And as we saw this weekend that OSU nutjob was killed within minutes of beginning his rampage.  Consequences should be severe enough that the murderhobo thinks twice.  Clearly there is nothing in the game that even comes close to this.  A system in which there is someone killing traders who supposedly are a vital part of that systems economy should care more.  They should send out a fleet of vessels to blow that guy up and if he comes back send even more ships to blow him up.  He should have to pay a heavy price for his crimes.  As it stands now there are heftier consequences for people who accidentally shoot an unwanted ship in a RES.  And as to your assertion that victims put themselves in those situations...Really?  All of them?  Like the guy who was in a CZ the other day and was killed by an ally with no cause or provocation other than because reasons?  What about him?Yes FDev needs to punish combat loggers but they also need to examine why combat logging is a thing in the first place.  You only want to address one side of the issue.,EliteDangerous,damefo2,10,t5_2vi60

9821434,0,t1_danopaf,The FDL should definitely be a strong midrange fighter no doubt about it. The problem comes when it eclipses other ships in their intended role.    Want an upclose brawler with huge firepower? Screw the Dropship or FAS FDLs just superior    Want a tanky support vessel with lots of flexibility? Sell your Gunship the FDL will outclass it in virtually every way    Want to bomb big ships with big hardpoints? Vulture just cant do what an FDL does    Want a stealthy hulltank that can pack a punch? No point trying to make the DBS work FDL stays silent longer and can deal more damageEvery single small or medium ship except maybe the courier simply cannot do anything the FDL cant do better. Thats where you have a problem when the FDLs role is simply to be better than everything smaller than an Anaconda in every way    Not to say the FDL should be nerfed but you have to admit theres a problem when everything else of a similar size thats combat dedicated cant hold a candle to it.

9839383,0,t1_dapon4a,Hello CMDR JLRazor here! So Im relatively new as well with only about  hours and Im still figuring stuff out I dont know too much but Ive got a grasp of the basics of the majority of things. So in the game there are the  factions that participate in powerplay which is the constant battle for territory and influence in human controlled space. Joining a faction is most relatable to joining the army for a country. Once you choose a faction to join you can participate in their preparation expansion and control missions to gain merits with that faction which determines your salary you get with that faction. The more you do for them the more merits you get so the larger the salary you get every week. In individual systems the benefit of helping a faction is that you get better missions the more they like you. If you help a faction that is also aligned to one of the  major alignments the federation the empire or the alliance then you also gain rep with that major alignment. This unlocks the ability to go to special systems and buy special ships that are part of those factions such as Sol the system where earth is which you need a higher federation rep to get to. At such an early stage in the game traveling across the galaxy can be very hard and large events like that attract very high skill players so that is where you are more likely to get killed with no gain of anything. If you need a buddy or a group to play with you can look me up Im aligned to Zachary Hudson who is part of the federation and weve got a good group of people going on.o,EliteDangerous,daq3ez8,2,t5_2vi60

9920745,0,t3_5hjprw,Valid opinion devs will have been paid to branch and support another platform.    However we dont know if these are devs that would be assigned to fixes or season development anyway and not newly employed PS codemonkeys  and so no actual headcount is lost to PC development.    Likewise the time and resources spent on another platform may have been considered worthwhile for the extra sales money which would then feed back into PC development.    Remember there are  million potential customers on PS and its not like sales will not help PC progression.  Ignoring please anything about No Mans Sky except the obvious appetite for a spaceship game getting some of those . million NMS PS gamers to buy ED would be a very good cash injection.

Dont go anywhere near intense combat without at least a couple rebuys in the bank.FDev introduced a new grind called the Engineers. Basically you fly around the galaxy collecting various materials from ships you shoot and from points of interest on planets then go to special NPCs give them materials and they change your modules properties. It is a long and frustrating grind but the results can be stellar.Then FDev realized that PvP players didnt like the changes that Engineers introduced and is now in process of testing a very heavy nerf pass in beta. Nothing is certain right now since it is beta but its not as if FDev ever listens to feedback. The beta is basically a preview before they roll it to live with a huge smile and the message of youll take it and youll like it bitch.You can fit passenger cabins instead of cargo racks and ferry passengers this way and that. Its the same as ferrying cargo except more annoying more restrictionsconditions.Mission payouts have been broken for a while. The big mainstays long distance hauling for one now pay peanuts. There was a moment where passenger missions paid a lot but I think that got nerfed too.You can fit a fighter hangar in bigger ships and carry a small fighter around and hire an NPC to fly it for you in exchange for a percentage of every profit. There are three fighters available they are extremely fragile durability is about  of a Sidewinder. They have zero utility other than being a fragile extra hardpointdistraction in combat. They dont even have landing gear.And coming up soon is the multicrew patch where by the looks of it big ships power will be cut down to  of what it used to be unless you have crew members on board. No you wont be able to hire NPCs to be your crew FDev explicitly said so. Want to fly an Anaconda? Welcome to the Open.There are plenty of unaddressed bugs graphical and otherwise and inconsistencies and quality of life features that are missing because either  FDev are too lazy to implement or  they run contrary to Brabens straightoutta vision. FDev doesnt care because they basically have the only working largescale space sim right now.

Sure there were and are positive achievements but they completely fade in contrast to war exploitation and carnage or even get destroyed and lost in that carnahe again and again. In the end its all about being stronger than the others subduing and exploiting the weaker ones. And i have the feeling it will stay this way until humanities violent final demise.And to say mankind is worse than chimpanzees would be a complete and utter insult to chimpanzees.

10056318,0,t3_5jqj4n,TLDR I only expect it to be functional at launch and thats if the networking fixes work with minor additions to what we can currently do as a pilot alone. Hopefully it will be the basis for expanded gameplay over time though for many game styles. IE large ships as actual gunboat platforms multivehicle base raiding and exploration with partners deeper scanning more Supercruise distractions and eventually Legs gameplay etc etc etc Longer Read None of your info is particularly new.  Weve known NPCs wouldnt be in at launch for over a year. They hope to get them in later. Really not the end of the world. They say there will be dedicated roles Helm  Tactical  Fire Control  Engineering Lets wait and see if its entirely combat orientated. It seems likely they wont get profound changes in to all the roles initially  IE combat roles are the most obvious fit re turrets etc. We do know they want to expand the role of scanners etc though. Lets wait and see ultimately.  They said Wing missions are more difficult than some of the other things on their want to do list so wont be in . but they want to do it. Thats not the same as No wing or shared missions because theyre too hard to make. It also doesnt preclude them adding other group activities over time such as alternate war zones where participation is autorewarded or what have you.DR the TLDR Yeah chill dont overhype.

My main concern is even with player controlled turrets and whatnot the survivability of a single ship against more than  adversaries is limited and the damage a single turret can do is small. I think itd be more fun if you all were in a large heavily shielded craft than can handle one on many simultaneous engagements. One buffed anaconda vs a wing of vultures in the middle of an active CZ for example.

10064904,0,t3_5jmyxk,This is broadly representative of my Missioning Python built for tooling around doing courier missions that sorta thing. You get jumped a lot by npcs and Im Deadly ranked at the moment so you tend to get quite frisky opponents.It works for that kind of combat mostly v against FDLs Condas and that sorta thing. Even with G Dirty Drives it still wont turn fast enough to keep up with most ships but the turrets make up for it. Yes you get lower DPS but your time on target is so much higher than with gimbals Ive tried it and it just doesnt work with them.The downside is cost. Note the .mil price tag on those beam turrets you also pay a heavy cost in WEP drain its advisable to pick up mods to compensate for that.I would say that the Python isnt the greatest for heavy combat. Its got too many downsides and a hefty enough rebuy to keep me away from any serious fights in it. Where it does excel is a heavily armed tradercourier at least until you can get your grubby mitts on a Conda.If youre looking for a combat ship thats a lot of fun you can do a lot worse than a FAS or Vulture if thats more in your price range. Id go with the FAS if it was an option its stupidly fun to fly once you get the hang of it the damn thingll fly sideways about as fast as forwards.

So in other words youd have request landing and request parking or something like that. Then thered be a hologram and a number just like with landing but itd be floating in space outside the station. When you fly into it your thrusters go into station keeping mode instead of shutting down. But otherwise it works just like landing.So now your ship is parked outside the station and youre connected to the station board. You can transfer cargo slowly using limpets or your shuttle idea.People would still prefer medium ships for outposts because theyd be faster and cheaper than using limpets.

10129756,0,t3_5kzztn,Factions and Powerplay are definitely more like endgame goals and are  not essential especially since it can be extremely confusing and grindy at first. Many people dont even care about powerplay its something that doesnt add a lot of depth for how much time investment it is to keep up with.About factions you basically gain influence in them by helping their economies doing missions turning in data selling goods etc and eventually youll start getting higher ranked in those factions. Their content is also mostly endgame basically you can unlock special ships for them that cant be purchased normally but you still have to pay millions of credits to buy them. I have almost  hours logged into the game and I havent touched powerplay and have only participated in factions very minorly. You can go through the whole game without doing anything for factions and still get the best ships and have a lot of fun. As for your credit situation bounty hunting is a great way to make money but so are community goals. These are found in the mission board and are basically missions that weight your performance against all participants and pay out massive amounts of credits for an early game player. Were talking several millions if you get into the top  which is very easy to do it just takes some time. Id recommend trying that to help get over that early hump of having very few credits.Let me know if you have any other questions! Good luck and fly safe CMDR o,EliteDangerous,dbrwv9x,5,t5_2vi60

10165755,0,t1_dbwc1bd,Crew stays with you till you get rid of them. If you switch to a ship without a fighter bay they will follow you and take the same amount from your income. Its not a good design and Im hoping this gets changed. The only other way to lose a crew member is if your ship is blown up. You can lose fighters  all day long but if your ship goes down they go down with it and you have to train a new one.As for fighter bays Fighters are basically D printed in your ship. This means if you send your crew guy out and they get blown up your ship begins making a new fighter for them to use. I want to say it takes about a minute.The benefit of having a fighter bay with two fighters housed in it is you can immediately send the crew member back out in the second fighter while the first bay prints a new ship. The value of that may vary from person to person. For me I pay that crew member. She can get her ass back out there and fight. No breaks!Addendum As my crew members skill has increased she has been getting shot down exponentially less. At dangerous or elite the second bay might see less and less use. At competent my crew member doesnt get blown up that often unless I send her in alone against three ships.,EliteDangerous,dbwceo4,1,t5_2vi60
10166269,0,t1_dbvy8gt,gt The amount of people asking is severely low because once youve asked for two years and got no answer it gets tiring.The problem is that the game isnt inherently multiplayer as a whole. Engineers profit everyone. Landing profits everyone because of new bases and materials and screenshot times. New ships profit everyone. Delivery missions profit everyone because even as PvP or explorer you need to make money in bubble. All of this you can do and play solo or multiplayer your choice.But wings dont profit everyone guilds profit very limited subset of players Powerplay arguably even smaller subset. And most of this you cant do solo which will sadden unknown percent of players who will say I paid for this game and now I cant use this content at all because I play solo that is unfair.Also the problem with this content IMO  aside of wings where I can see some appeal  is the size of powerplay  guilds the big multiplayer content bigger than    guys. You either own such a small sector that its virtually useless as a guild  and then why even make it  in hopes some CG happens there? Or you build such a big sector that you are getting into the powerplay levels  and thats way too big and conflicting with our role designed in the game. The game is about flying around and doing various jobs not about excel sheeting your virtual bank and fleets across  planetary systems it would need a serious rehaul for that to even happen.So basically all of that is a bit lower priority  aside of wings I guess because of the next update.,EliteDangerous,dbwei65,1,t5_2vi60

Blow them up quickly and press Escape gt To menu. Itll count down from . Because youre behind the ship it usually needs to do a loop to face you. This should take  seconds which means  seconds of fire on you.. Rinse and repeat until all missions are doneI did it in a Cobra with max shields to avoid your problem.

So when rushing isnt the issue and tools are meant to be used why do you need to make a point of telling people not to work for them?Or rather why do you feel the need to say peoples feelings are explicitly wrong when theyre evaluating the process independent of pacing?And yes I could have downvoted improperly as downvotes arent intended specifically for simple disagreement as I understand them but I didnt because as I understand them downvotes arent intended specifically for simple disagreement and genuinely wondered if there was some deeper substance to the need to unsolicitedly come into the discussion to complain about it even happening.Lastly I never told you not to say anything just asked why you said what you did which solicits more speech from you so Im not sure why you broke out the free speech lecture and on a private forum that has no obligation to host or broadcast your speech ironically.gtI have seen enough of those  perpetuated by people who have no idea how a game even works  even less about how this particular game works.Fair enough.

What matters more is quality.  Rings and asteroid belts can be Metallic Metal Rich Rocky and Icy.  There is also a systemwide qualitylevel in descending order Pristine Major Common Low and Depleted.  Look at the system map to see what it is.  Metallic has the best materials.  Ice has possibly the very valuable Low Temperature Diamonds but you are not very likely to find enough in a reasonable time and the rest is rather worthless.  Go to Metallic if you find Metal Rich if not.  The nonHorizons starter system LHS  has got Metalliccommon asteroid belts.  Look for Platinum Palladium Osmium or Gold.

10227414,0,t3_5mg3lq,Yeah you touched on the main problem...Its not that cruise ships are bad for what they do.  Its just that what they do isnt something you can actually do in game.Passenger missions are either about max range but passenger capacity is irrelevant VIP sightseeing in which case an Asp is pretty much the goto or about sheer number of internals Economy bulk in which case MP ships are still the goto.There needs to be another mode of Passenger gameplay that actually simulates a cruise line so that the niche for cruise ships is actually rewarded.  Cruise ships take a buttload of passengers on a cruise to multiple destinations and charge more the more luxurious their accomodations are.  In game that should mean a mission thats a hybrid between Transport and Sightseeing...a mission where you can fill up your cabins with as many passengers as possible not locked to one mission per cabin like VIPs with higherrated cabins offering higher payouts per passenger then take them on a predetermined route with added bonuses for making ports of call or other side objectives.  Then there would be a reason to have highcapacity Luxury ships.This needs to be done before the Dolphin comes out if it ever does because that will likely make the Beluga and Orca obsolete by letting you complete Luxury VIP missions in a more economical smaller charter yacht the only reason why youd want to fit Luxury cabins right now.,EliteDangerous,dc3c221,9,t5_2vi60

If you do not want involuntary PVP but do like cooperative interaction you might want to sign into that instead of Open Which is PVP.  You have the same character for all modes and can swap between them at will.You can go days without seeing others even in Open since the Galaxy is so big.

10252838,0,t3_5mt07t,In NMS I spent most of my time walking. In Elite you will spend all your time flying a spaceship or driving a buggy on planets if you have Horizons too in a full size Milky Way galaxy. Ive got  hours in ED and love it but it is not for people that need to be told what to do or how to do it. Theres lots of help on this subreddit and youtube videos and external websites but the game doesnt hold your hand.Horizons adds a lot including landing on planets only without atmosphere right now and small ship launched fighters. You can also access special engineers that can make your ship  better than stock. Still you can spend lots of time in the base game and add the Horizons dlc later if you find you like the game. Horizons includes  major updates of which  have been released so far. Multicrew will be in the next update and nobody knows what is in the final one but most players think it will heavily involve aliens.Watch some Youtube videos and see if the gameplay appeals to you. If you want to feel like youre flying a spaceship there isnt another game like it IMO.,EliteDangerous,dc67rmk,60,t5_2vi60

10263606,0,t3_5mz6xn,gt ED looks like its got solid combat and immersion but will I be able to spend hours scavenging looking for rage ore to mine upgrade my ship in detail enjoy some rare items via rng drops of some sort or complex crafting?TLDR If youre looking for some sort of grindforupgrades mechanic then yes you can spend hours on ship upgrades through Engineers.Longer answerThe economy is not complex  not even close to EVE. You basically do stuff to make credits. Credits  currency. You buy ships with credits. You upgrade your ship with better modules with credits. The type of stuff you do to earn credits is up to you. If youre a minmax type of player then youll probably settle in on one or two activities that fits your style and creditsneeds. It can take a somewhat long time to get into one of the biggest ships in the game.If you buy the Horizons update which includes Engineers dont expect to be competitive in pvp encounters if you dont grind Engineers then you can spend even more countless hours grinding for upgrades. Engineers are NPCs that have secret bases in the game. They will provide upgrades to your ships modules for favors  and some of these upgrades are arguably OP. You have to discover meet unlock and then grind rank with each engineer. Its time consuming and the upgrades are partially RNGbased within certain limits. This means you probably have to keep rolling for a bestcasescenario upgrade. If an engineer will upgrade your thrusters for some Specialised Legacy Firmware for example then you need to bring some extra copies of that item in order to improve the odds of getting a good roll. Grinding rank for better upgrades essentially means buying a bunch of upgrades you may not even want or accept.,EliteDangerous,dc7fox3,2,t5_2vi60

10264879,0,t1_dc7k6a3,Theres a minimum and maximum period that certain states last. Both War and Civil War have a minimum duration of  days and a maximum duration of  days.Beyond that Wars and Civil Wars have a win condition that if met will trigger the end of the battle. The win condition is met when one faction gains a significant amount of influence over the other. I think its  for a civil war and something much higher for an actual war Its either  or  I thinkThe amount that the influence levels can change each day is capped but the figure varies depending on the population of the system lower populations allow for quicker swings and the amount of commanders undertaking actions in the system more commanders allows for quicker swings.If you want to prolong the war I would suggest keeping a close eye on the system traffic reports and the influence levels of the two factions involved. Youll probably have to fight for both sides to prolong things to the maximum extent possible assuming no other outside influence from other players.Wars that occur where only one side is offering massacre missions can be extremely one sided and end quickly if players flock to the location.

Shipyard being the ships for sale at that specific station and outfitting being where you upgrade the ship youre currently in.Power plant  this is what gives your ship power. The long bar along the bottom of the outfitting menu screen shows how much power you have available and how much youve used. Better power plant  more power.Thrusters  They make you go. Better thrusters  more go.Frame Shift Drive FSD  Makes you go long. This part is what primarily determines the jump range of your ship. Better FSD longer jump range.Power Distributer  This directs power to the  subgroups of modules in your ship Engines ENG Systems SYS and Weapons WEP.Using the arrow keys you can redistribute power using whats known as the pips at the bottom right of the screen when youre flying around. More pips to SYS your shields are a bit stronger pips to WEP your lasers fire longer before overheating pips to ENG and you fly a bit faster and turn quicker.Sensors  The better your sensors are the further your ship can see and target other ships in your area when youre flying around. So you might be able to have a ship pop up on your HUD KM away rather than KM and you getting a surprise.Life Support  If your canopy is breached in combat the life support keeps you alive for a set amount of time. Im sure the standard time is  mins but the better life support systems can multiply that to give you more of a chance of getting back to a station and repaired without dying.SO.Theyre the most important parts about your ship.

Find some police forces System Authority and follow them around. They will attack any ships that are marked as wanted. You can help kill them and collect the bounty. Make sure you scan them have the ship targeted and watch the target details panel in the bottom left and make sure they are wanted before you open fire. This will earn you bounties that you can turn in at a station for credits.After doing this for a while youll be able to afford a new ship and equipment and youll be able to take on harder content. Harder content will be in order Resource Extraction Site Low Resource Extraction Site Resource Extraction Site High Resource Extraction Site Hazardous and Combat Zones.Combat Zones are fairly large scale NPC battles but I think still small compared to EVE Ive not played it.

10375945,0,t3_5olbxa,This should give you an idea.Basically using your discovery scanner we call honking because of the honking like sound it does. This lets you find celestial bodies within a certain range or unlimited range for an advanced discovery scanner. You still get paid for each object but only a rather small amount of money.In the link i posted you can see how much each object pays out when you do a proper scan. This means you need to target the object and go within a certain range to scan it. Larger objects can be scanned from further away. Normal stars from a few thousand LS sometimes sypergiants can be scanned from like  thousand LS gas giants  LS and normal planets like  LS roughly. Additional to that you can increase the payout for a direct object scan if you have a surface scanner equipped scanning is the same and if you are the first one to scan and turn in the data for an object no first discovered by tag.,EliteDangerous,dck6dht,4,t5_2vi60

10388045,0,t1_dcliuz1,A bin requires basically  micromanagement so it is by far the preferred refinery when mining especially in pristine rings.Docking computer means when you request docking you just need to press x or whatever you have throttle to  bound to and it will dock for you its nice weighs nothing takes the smallest slot and uses almost  power so for ships where you dont really need the smallest slot it is a good option to fill it Im quite fond of them though general opinion is more mixed.Vehicle hangers are required if your trying to get engineering materials but are big heavy and take a fair amount of power so i wouldnt haul one around when not being used. And if your mining your not using it. One extra slot means if you destroy your SRV you dont need to go back to the dock to redeploy a second.You dont have enough power to effectively power  beam lasers. Beam lasers are quite powerful though so a gimbled beam laser is extremely effective at killing small fast ships gimbled means you dont need to try as hard to center your huge brick on that tiny ing fly. Fixed cannon has higher DPS than a gimbled cannon and cannons are near useless against fast ship due to projectile speed. If your already shooting a slow ship gimbled weapons are more of a problem than a benefit due to chaff. Using the beam on that fast ship you cant pin down and the cannon on the slow ship that you want to kill fast. You also REALLY dont want dual large fixed weapons on the clipper as its large hardpoints are really far apart making it hard to get both to be on a single target. Mixed weapons also means that you can exploit the weaknesses of shields and armor shields are weak to thermal and armor is weak to kinetic generallyShield boosters are really nice when combined with biweave shield generators and when engineered they are damn near the best utility mount in the game. As far as the other defensive measures that is up to you. Chaff I find more or less ineffective once you have a big ship as even with chaff gimbaled weapons are still pretty good at hitting you. Point defenses are good but can be overwelmed ECM is nice measure against the extremely deadly torpedos.If you just want the combat stuff to get away from combat i would just A rate your thruster and dirty drive engineer it if you can you will need to boost your generator to handle that though.,EliteDangerous,dcljsxu,1,t5_2vi60

10513253,0,t3_5qjnc4,This is the number one issue I had when I started this game. Overcoming the stigma that comes with traditional games. IE WoW grinding drop quests etc  There is actually quite a lot of fun to be had within wings and groups and running with peeps. Depending on what you want to do you can choose as stated here prior all kinds of options. There is one more you could that is ongoing is the Lore aspect of this game. The puzzles and stuff with the ThargoidsGuardians and even the back story of the FormalDine Rift. All are very interesting and WAY involved. Im soooo not smart enough for half of these things however the promise of finding something of being the first person to discover something never before seen that drives a ton of people who play in the game. If you need more structure follow the Community Goals they at least give you places to go and do things like trade runs mining missions bounty hunts combat missions etc. While they update once a week they give you something to look forward to do. My crew we typically use the CG for the beginning of the weekend activity and then finish off with Power Play stuff and bounty hunts...even some ruin diving. There is a lot of stuff.

10535563,0,t3_5qtnkh,I remember when I first took my first mission assasinate a pirate. I was already flying a Vulture and hat avoided combat missions thus far. I was looking forward to a new experience. The mission description told me I would need a Frame Shift Drive Interdictor to pull my target out of Hyperspace. So I got one and went hunting. I waited for the specified time when the target was said to be in the area and began scanning ships that appeared in the area. Boy was I disappointed when I realized im not supposed to do that but simply wait for the mission signal source to appear just like with the salvage missions I had been doing before.

Once youve added a ship theres a field for saying where its located.The big thing that Inara doesnt do well is saying which modules are on your ship. You have to configure your ship in Coriolis or ED Shipyard then export the details and paste then into Inara.Another set of tools that helps here is EDSM and ED Market Connector EDMC.

10542653,0,t1_dd2uk6d,Well warp travel literally compresses space infront and expands space behind altering HOW you travel through space rather than actually allowing you to FTL so presuming that FSD works in the same way youd only smack into a part of the station as big as your bow wake is at the max speed of your ship normally is capable of in normal cruise so not that fast at all if its an Ananaconda.On the other hand youd only be hitting a small section of the station with the surrounding area being warped massively so the collision MIGHT displace that section of the station a bit but youre still hitting a massive block of steel or whatever with your dinky little ship at a relatively slow speed.It would be nothing compared to the micrometeorite barrage that it would constantly sustain during its existence.

10548272,0,t1_dd2x9rh,gt This can be adjusted with additional coding but then youre adding conditionals for If Conda shield then this fine if Viper shield then this fine and it gets bloated really quickly.  Yup thats a good way to end up with unintended consequences. KISS is always better option if you dont have a good reasonrequirement to make it more complex.  Ive proposed a method where authority ships in the fight would split up depending on the value of bounties. So if you nick and authority ship chasing after an Anaconda with a big bounty then you might end up with one authority ship chasing you instead of all of them instantly chasing you. It would make more sense and it would give the player who made the errant shot a better chance of escaping. Theyd still be stuck with the bounty and would need to leave that RES until they cleared it.  Im not a fan of giving players a free pass for accidentally shooting ships in a RES.

Just set it to a low value and see how blurry it gets.The point of using upsampling vs simply lowering the resolution is usually that HUD elements are still rendered at full resolution anyways. But since Elites HUD is fully D ingame elements that doesnt apply.Its a strange thing yes. Only use case would be choosing your game windows size resolution setting and being able to set render resolution independently.

Ships destroyed can sometimes leave behind ruined hulks rather than complete explosions Ship debris either whole ships or the current debris fragments can be melted down with mining lasers and put through the refinery to get unique materials and minerals using the same mechanics as mining but rewarding different commodity types not currently available through asteroid mining. from intact bulks it would be possible to extract whole but broken modules which can be taken back to a station in the cargo hold and repaired amp fitted to the ship. AFMUs could be used to reduce the repair cost but modules would not be equippable without an Outfitting equipped port Engineered modules would either lose their customisation in the repair process or be reduced by a number of grades. keeping the rarity and value behind the Gs but allowing all players access to G modules without having to unlock engineers as a rare drop Asteroids stop being fixed points in space and gain small amounts of momentum meaning that miners have to be more aware of their surroundings to avoid being crashed into.All of the above adds QoL and gameplay allowing for further specialisation of mining increased skill and rewards and adds a subspecialisation of salvaging that applies the mining gameplay features in a new fashion and builds multicrew into the mining beyond just running  defence fighters in a hazrezlimitations Hud elements for asteroids. Ideally this should be done with an overlay over the asteroids. This type of HUD element does not yet exist in the game and would require an iteration pass over the HUD or spamming the Contacts panel with asteroids that are targetable in the traditional fashion which given the sheer volume of asteroids in a HAZ rez is going to overflow it. Rework of ship destruction mechanisms. Currently abandoned ships are just untargetable zero movement NPCs.  Ship debris is currently client specifc. It would need to be turned into something that is shared across the instance like fragments and materials from destroyed ships The idea of moving asteroids in a PP environment that need synchronised probably just gave their netcode design team a collective aneurysm a simple concept with massive ramifications.The above features would need to be spread over several seasons or have one or even two major content patches dedicated to them.,EliteDangerous,dd6o338,3,t5_2vi60

Even without the modified lasers the only concession to do is to disable the cargo hatchor put it in priority . I would then engineer most parts starting with the shield and shield boosters to increase resistance to damage. If you cant afford it right now downgrade the military grade composite to lightweight or reinforced. And the thruster from A to B. It should be under  millions then.

Given that being a commander requires no special moves or physical skills other than the ones youre already doing in real life I tend to think of my avatar as actually being me  if I become a pirate or a miner its because of what I would do not what my character would do.Even looking at a camera shot of a character who almost looks like me isnt quite the same thing.But its different for other players who may value the roleplaying experience more and want to create something.I wouldnt object to creating alternate characters to be the ones that sit in my friends spare seats during multicrew while the real me is still in my own ship out there somewhere.,EliteDangerous,dd8csvc,2,t5_2vi60

For anyone whos starting these sorts of fights theres also a good chance theyll have to pay their own rebuy costs which are significant if youre flying something like a Corvette but they seem not to care.

10653354,0,t3_5s9w5d,Oh theres much to discover. From time to time you stumble across a system that has special features. A planet real close to the sun a moon with a tilt orbit that lets you see the rings of the gas giant its orbiting the incredible view when youre as far out as Beagle Point or high above the galactic plain... To me exploring is about the feeling of really being far out. Landing on planets where you know nobody has ever landed before. Its an illusion of course but its a perfect one. I love exploring especially in VR.Nothing you suggest would improve exploring in a significant way IMO. Im not going k LYs out into the black to have a randomly generated Exploration Signal Source appear on entering a system just to keep me entertained. After scanning the th crashed ship or randomly placed alien site that would become pretty boring and you would be here complaining again I suppose.The galaxy is procedurally generated. Its the same to everyone. That makes exploring so appealing to me. I know that I just discovered something that was here all along and that others could visit too. And Im the first to set my eyes on it. Randomly generated points of interest would be just that. Randomly generated. Not relevant not improving exploring. To me at least.Having said that I would very much appreciate more stuff to discover. Black holes that feed on a star that is orbiting too close and kill you wenn you get too close too stars that are only in the early stages of forming maybe the aftermath of a Supernova. Who knows Im sure theres a wide range of objects that are not yet in the game. But gameplaywise Exploring is fun as it is to me.,EliteDangerous,ddet826,2,t5_2vi60

Based on system?kinda... more like your instance. supercruise fast travel has its on local and if you drop from supercruise you will be in an instance.Think of it like free Warp Drive youll have warp drive local and once you slow down to not be in wawrp anymore youll have a different local.And on top of tht not everyone is in the same instance. like a different server in the same system. So systems often times feel empty due to people being in different instance. The game often times has issues with people randomly dropping out of your instance and often occurs when you initiate an interdiction. Basically you rip someone out of warp drive to drop them to normal space with you which loads a new instance sometimes they wont even be in your instance.gtAre there like active specialized groups in Elite that use Discord  rd party software or anything?yeah groups like to use teamspeak or discord to communicate cross wing kinda like using mumble to communicate to other fleets.gt Have the devs talked about reworking the social aspect?Not afaik FD the devs like the make a lot of claims but ultimately hold little water.,EliteDangerous,ddim8ay,1,t5_2vi60

10819238,0,t1_ddvmv7j,Sure pirate ships will go down much faster when bounty hunting as well as an increased rate of spawn due to multiple commanders present in an instance. Large ships that are performing mining can benefit from crewmates killing pirates in a res site. This is huge. Also if the turret gunner can use a mining laser and if the asteroids behave similarly to wing mining where each commander generates their own pool of fragments then multicrew mining will mean double the credits for the miner. ,EliteDangerous,ddvxf87,2,t5_2vi60

10881805,0,t3_5veiqf,Congrats! I just recently got the clipper quince surface scanning to rank up fully outfittedengineered it and it is quite a good ship. Its fast has decent agility especially over the python and conda and the weapon placement isnt that bad compared to the python. The only thing I dislike about the clipper is that the cockpit is gaudy...lol. I much prefer the cockpits in the python or conda. The delacy ships have almost a sports car interior  I like it. The courier is similar but not as gaudy. Still it looks goofy when you throw a different color on the imperial ships other than white.The imperial ships seem kind of lame with the white composite interiors with blue lights for the trim everywhere. I wish we could change the color schemes inside the cockpit. I would pay real money to be able to customize the inside to match the outside livery.It would be cool to have a carbon black exterior carbon interior with red or orange light trim around the cockpit.

10915840,0,t1_de5cnus,Might depend. If you only have one cargo rack and  tons when filled up it should hardly affect the ship.Moreover I think it mostly just keeps using the whole mass system. A lot of systems and modules in the game have an optimised mass threshold going above usually hampers responsiveness or jump range or acceleration and speed.  Since that mechanic is calculated and implemented as a general rule taking the ships weight into account when you add tons of cargo the ships weight increases accordingly and the same optimised mass equation takes the weight into account.Thats why you have more than one number for stuff like Jump Range in outfitting.  My Cobras upgraded and so hauling  tons around I dont really notice a huge difference now that he mentioned it yes I guess theres a bit of a change full vs empty.,EliteDangerous,de5w41b,1,t5_2vi60

Like you say some form of ingame options earning skins and decals through loyalty bonuses with a faction or ingame cred purchases at least for base colours would balance it out a bit.Im kinda fine with them charging for fancy fonts to a degree I dont think anything we said on that would have changed it either tbh. Its a slot of work getting this to gel with all the ship variants and probably licensing or designing fonts on top for a pure cosmetic flourish. What seems daft is that there isnt a utilitarian placeholder for free if wanted. Think they could be pushed into doing that if theres enough rage and they get reasonable uptake on the fancy fonts,EliteDangerous,debf9vp,1,t5_2vi60

10974283,0,t1_debw50t,I agree the game can be a bit grindy been playing since release with over  hrs logged. Big key for me personally was to not rush the big ships just play the game and have fun.Not suggesting that changes should not be made to the income rate especially since the scaling of income potential seems to falloff around midtier ships. That being said an exploity method is not the answer....this is evident by the amount of players we see finding themselves rich and jumping straight into the larger ships with no idea how to actually play the game. This is a marathon type game and you really should not be able to get into a any of the big  ships within your first month or  of gameplay that being said there should be constant progression throughout a persons playtime.in short exploits bad but game does need a fix to incomeprogression scaling and rates,EliteDangerous,deby1qq,4,t5_2vi60

I agree with you and its plain to see that cargo missions are not stacking in the manner which is being criticised as its naturally restricted by your ability to carry the requisite goods in your specific ship. The current scan mission stacking which is being taken advantage of by many is a different story since without the artifical cap of  there would be no limit to how many you could take and the manner in which the bases and accompanying landed ships spawn inside each other due to the stacking is a clear indication that this scenario is by no means an intended outcome by fdev. ,EliteDangerous,den2r0s,2,t5_2vi60

From what I know of the elite netcode that Ive gleaned from the server devs amazon talk and the many discussions and QAs what youre suggesting is physically impossible with the existing network system.The only authority on your ships life or death is your own computer. No other computer or server has the right to claim your death. When you disconnect there is nothing that can kill your ship. The transaction servers and your opponents computer cant know why you disconnected. It can be network issues it can be game crashes or it can be purposeful sabotage combat log. But it isnt really possible to find out. Fdev have telemetry ie watch systems that sends messages about suspected disconnects and such but these are after the fact and hard to verify. These reports more or less have to be studied by a human to determine if someone is a combat logger or if he just has some really crappy Internet.Its not possible to have a player ship be piloted by AI while the network system is as it currently is.

Saying that there are programs to create control layout diagrams for most sticks so you could put this image on your desktop then switch to desktop view in the HMD using the button on its left side to use this memory aid as a fallback.Look for Dr Kaiis profile switcher a helper app that allows one click switching of ED between VR and Flat Vision.Consider using a player mentor group that has a voice channel DiscordTeamSpeak so you can get assistance without having to take the Vive off.

If that was demonstrating its possible wed never had to check out any theoretical physics Einstein? We can take his theory as fact because the equations balance out never mind the scientific theory that says you need to consistently demonstrate in a possibly falsifiable manner that the phenomenon is consistently true. That is what you are asserting right now the math works therefore it is true and you are right.

11363224,1,t1_dfjlywm,gt Its the same reason you dont start with a lvl  WoW character when you first join. Yes you can get twinked by friends but you cant gain levels. Since there are no levels in Elite you are essentially granting someone a topcharacter when they dont know how to play.You are wayyyy out of line with WoW. Let me tell you my dear friend that WoW nowadays gives a  level character from the maximum so you can enjoy just the new content. Because even Blizzard understood that grinding sucks ass... Even for money its  to get  levels from the maximum. So you can enjoy the NEW CONTENT. Because as it proved before you arrogant fool is that players dont go back to low level. Sure sometimes. But a noob will gonna stay there like  weeks and if he sees only   people in eagles and the rest in Anacondas because they already grinded weeks before will just give up the game.

11453843,0,t3_63gm3u,As others have said since there is no official endgame its all about what you make of it. I know that sounds trite but if you expand on it its no wonder that single players often feel the burn out the most because its hard as one person to really make an impact on a galactic scale which imo is the true endgame at least for memaking as big of a name for yourself as you canhow well and how much you can shape your surroundings. Which is why I will always advocate for joining player groups. The great thing is that there are so many of them there should be no problem with finding one for any particular gaming style or career preference. Being in a group means that you have some guaranteed positive social interaction which is nice it can be kind of draining to have to be on alert every time you see another CMDR. It also means you have people who can back you up and that you have a motivation for backingup. In my group the overarching mission is to expand and solidify our footprint within the Empire and the galaxy at large but within that theres a ton of different objectives and tasks to take care of on the daily which adds up to me always having a diverse selection of things to do when I feel like playing and for pretty compelling reasons. Before I joined the group the biggest motivation I had for doing things after earning credits to arate my ship was just to learn how to do it after that I had no real reason to go and do any of it. But now in the context of my playergroup and our goals I have good reasons to go mining or do some trade beyond just becasue I want to chill or make some credits.,EliteDangerous,dfua9a2,2,t5_2vi60

Similar to EVE Online except you still have normal first person flight controls but you make the systems smaller and you do move at higher speeds e.g. you have  speeds of travel Jump intersystem warp long distance intrasystem and then just normal for short distance. Just dont have any WarpSuper Cruise mechanic and make systems super smallThe main problem with super cruise is that its ridiculously tedious and you cant be passive about it because you have to worry about running into objects or being pulled out of super cruise by enemies plus you have to worry about slowing down at the destination. If you want to keep the danger element you go with option  remove the ability to be blocked by celestial objects remove the need to slow down at target and remove the velocity scaling near celestial objects.

How did this even launch?I do want to be positive and hope they fix this stuff soon but Frontier is stubborn and worse slow. At least I can give major props to the character creation and most cockpit changes but too much has been borked graphically. Since you played beta did they balance rank progression?

11559485,0,t1_dg5z90u,Thats my problem.The game is desperately in need of some other motivator besides credits.  World of Warcraft had seasonal points for PvP and raiding that could be used to exchange for gear and cosmetics then every so often a new line of stuff would come out that people could work toward.Something similar could work for ED.  Assign point values to things like meeting thargoids finding special boxes in the USS etc.Spend the points on special modules or ship variants with unique paint jobs  altered base stats.  Lock them behind these point walls and make most of them unable to be purchased instore until after the season is over.  If the loss of store profit is a major concern FD could sell point boosters  increase for  days etc to make up for it.OR make everything in the Frontier store purchasable with credits then evenout the credit making across activities Planetary landing exploration bounties etc.  Id start playing like a fiend if I got to use credits to buy stupid little face tattoos for my holome.I really want to play but I need a direction to play in.

Its getting a bit tiring. Before crowd funding games was a thing game devs would take virtually no public suggestions. That decision was not for no reason People in general dont know what they want or dont realize what they want is unreasonable to flesh out in place of game mechanics designed by a seasoned professional. I say that as a software developer who regularly works with end user defined specs and suggestions. Its just plain impossible to make everyone happy and I wouldnt doubt that one reason fDev ends up with these half baked updates is from spreading themselves too thin by listening to the community too much. Between the polarized wants of the community here and on the frontier forums alone it seems they spend an inordinate amount of time flip flopping on petty things just to entertain the split while ignoring how to progress core mechanics like mission depth and sensical reward systems.,EliteDangerous,dg6mhqi,7,t5_2vi60

In this case I bought something that I thought was Item AB. Later without telling me they changed their store description to be only item A Item B is sold separately. The bit that gets me is that if I had not been paying attention and made the effort to follow up with support they would likely have cheerfully let me go on without saying anything. So Im not mad that they made a mistake. I am interested in how they are handling their mistake and their response as a result of that.

Wed be doing what we wanted either way but one of these you also get paid and one you dont.This isnt rocket science its not hard to understand. Unless someone is way outside the bubble any time you save with telepresence is completely and utterly negated by the time you have to spend later earning the credits you didnt get through your multicrew session.So if the fun is equal and wings are far more efficient in terms of time and money what reason does my friend have to mc with me instead of bringing his Vulture?

You will definitely see higher threat targets here though if you go to a Resource Extraction Site Low theres a lot less ships in general copspirates but they tend to be little bitch ships like competent Eagles and shit and you dont get much money for those.

Having said that... gt It also shows that FDev dont play the game by the same rules as other players the idea that someone can come in and mess with your ship is so disliked because so much time goes into earning and outfitting and customising vesselsI think this is absolutely true.

So if the algorithm is looking for a destination in the X direction it wont need to try and search in the X direction until it runs into a spot where estimate for the current Node is longer than the estimate for some other Nodes at which time itll start picking those for exploration.  You can also weight the choices in a manner that allows the pathfinder to  . Aggressively look for the very best path More time and computing power.  .

11755596,0,t3_67msxp,The Manual Docking Only Master Race in this community needs to die a swift death.  It honestly makes zero difference how you dock.  I can do both but for large ships like my Corvette I primarily use a docking computer because frankly docking isnt that exciting and I find no sense of pride in manually docking.  Its like buying a new car and telling the dealer to disable the parking camera because youre too cool for that.  Like anyone knows or cares.As for manually docking I have never once been faced with a rebuy for docking failure.  It would take an epic amount of not understanding your controls and subsequent screwup to destroy a ship while docking like hitting boost on accident or pissing off the station by taking  minutes to dock and ignoring all warnings.Most of players docking issues come from not using the correct control scheme not understanding their control scheme or having a terrible controller.  Taking time to map out your control scheme for docking specifically studying it and giving yourself a good  minutes of practice will all but guarantee you can avoid dockingrelated rebuys.  Or you could simply use a docking computer. No harm no foul.  The game doesnt punish you for using one so I dont see why the community should feel the need to.,EliteDangerous,dgsiylo,2,t5_2vi60

At the very least itll constantly radiate heat passively not to mention the extra thermal bursts whenever it adjusts its position around a star.Also that energy that the Dyson sphere absorbs would be used for something. It wouldnt be able to infinitely  continue to collect the energy. Overcharging a battery causes it to explode so if a Dyson sphere would exists millennia after its creation something needs to be done with all that energy even if its just venting it into space.,EliteDangerous,dgsm190,1,t5_2vi60

I started by bouncing between Niu Hsing and Col  Sector YFM C which was effective while one Fed faction was in Bust state lots of donations and the other was in Boom lots of data missions. Then both changed to neutral. That was about a week ago it may or may not have gotten better.After that I moved to  Ursae Majoris and Gunnlodumla. Theres only one Fed faction there but it was routinely giving ample data missions while in Expansion state.Ceos and Sothis is also another viable pair though I didnt grind it very long. And when I did it was unsuccessfully for Sirius rep.All three pairs could be viable but the Fed faction in any pair must be in a Boom state. Otherwise youll spend way too much time board hopping.Regardless of which pair you pick the method is the same. Pick up  data delivery missions from one system with liberal use of board hopping deliver them to the other system then pick up  more data missions and deliver them to the first system. Repeat for several hours.,EliteDangerous,dgws0jz,3,t5_2vi60

Nobody is so retarded that they would in their right mind put HARRY FUCKING POTTER only the most well known griefer in the Elite Dangerous community in position to be defending Salome. NOBODY. When I read that SDC would be collaborating with the defense I knew that they would turn. At least one. In the discord when everybody was called into Thepodium channel they claimed that it was all part of their plan to have Harry go after Salome so he wouldnt take out the other two on PC.

I havent been a part of something this coordinated since my days flying wing PVP in The Code and this was magnitudes more massive than anything we did. I was hanging out in the Canonn Fleet  server and the sense of unity and coordination over what we were doing was like no else it must feel like that in those massive battles in EVE. I thought that was alot but when we were given the orders to go into the PAC server people kept piling into the PAC. There must have been more than a thousand people in attendance to listen. It was absolutely an incredible experience for Elite and I would like to thank all who put this together. I hope theres more of this in the future.,EliteDangerous,dgxjnpi,10,t5_2vi60

11804900,0,t1_dgy3vnv,Depends on how far away they are and if they have wing beacon on. Its the same as dropping in to any other wake and offcourse how long the game takes to place you in to instance. Way longer than to kill a lightly or nonengineered ship with an engineered ship anyway thats just how FD has decided to balance the game. They were allready in a fight with a different attacker anyway.  ,EliteDangerous,dgy4k1a,1,t5_2vi60
11805262,0,t1_dgy3z68,gt One thing I dont understand about Potter killing Salome. She wasnt AI why did she try to fight the interdiction? Why not just submit boost away and FSD out?This is what happens when one person Salome is playing a character and the other Potter is a human playing a game and trying to get maximum metaeverything from every little moment.In reality by lore you dont submit to interdictions. You escape. By lore if you submit youre pretty screwed. Now in game it is different. The best thing to do with the lines of code is to submit and boost.Metagamers with no sense of inworld character are what killed most MMORPGs. If it is just numbers and lines of code of course people will approach it by asking how they can advantage the lines of code instead of asking what their pilot would actually do.,EliteDangerous,dgy615j,8,t5_2vi60
