10308017,0,t1_dccg2wb,Ive got to go somewhere so Ill make the reply quick sorry.gtThis is part of why its an NFL for Accelerator to even be able to reflect FTL attacks in the first place. There is a nonzero time period during which Kihara reverses his punchs vector while the field is trying to do the same. Any attack that gets through before the field can finish doing so would hit Accelerator. If the field took  time to reverse incoming vectors the Kihara Counter wouldnt work no matter how fast Kihara himself is.The Kihara counter really screws with how the vector field works for example he blocked misakas light speed attack without paying attention IIRC but Kihara can get through the shield. The reflection is instantaneous or damn near close to it. The Kihara counter interferes with the ability to redirect and interferes with the aim field. gtWhat are you trying to say that Gokus just going to concede the fight a few hours in? He has lowballing a relative year to figure out how to get past the field before Accelerator even blinks. Figuring out the precise thickness of the AIM field takes a couple minutes of gently poking at various places around Accelerator. Learning the mechanics of the redirection is another couple hours. He has all the time in the world to try everything under the sun  including using the sun Accelerator doesnt passively redirect photons either so that he can remain visible as yet another weakness.How exactly would it take minutes? And that requires Goku to see the AIM field. Or at least have some form of knowledge on it. Youre giving Goku waaaaay too much credit. Can you name instances where hes had to do something other than hit really hard? Because even the time skip was just overpowered by Ki. And accelerator passively blocks out sunlight which is why hes so pale. gtTaking away a targets oxygen without destroying the planet is a little bit complex for Goku  easy for him to do hard for him to figure out. And it requires a shitton of patience. Accelerators not gonna run out of air faster just because hes up against an FTL opponent Goku still needs to wait super long.I find it really funny how you say that taking away oxygen is more complex than figuring out the mechanics of a completely foreign reality warping ability. ,whowouldcirclejerk,dccgwmn,2,t5_2xvqy
