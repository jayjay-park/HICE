173161,0,t1_cey0i0e,So true! I have done cookies and cakes that I have gotten so feed up with things not going right I have wanted to throw them out. But when I brought them where they were going people seem to compliment me so much lol Also a trick for getting straight lines with royal icing is to pull the line. The best way I can describe this without just showing you is stick down where you want the line to start. Slowly and steadily pull it to where you want it to end. And squeeze your piping bag with an even amount of pressure and stick down the end of the line. I hope this helps I practice alot on just a piece of parchment so I can do it over and over. Practice really does make perfect!,cookiedecorating,cey5m6z,2,t5_2xe5x

1881529,0,t3_2g3w3f,Personally I love mine. Though I have the Artograph I probably dont use mine like a lot of other people use theirs though. It is really great for consistency. Need  logo cookies? This is a great alternative to time consuming methods or hand drawing them all which is what I used to do.Most of my orders are for custom work though not usually character cookies or commercial things. I use mine for lettering designs silhouettes photos and on occasion intricate fonts. I usually hand draw my designs on paper where I can erase and redo anything I want to since once its on a cookie there it is and theres little you can do to fix it. So I draw my designs up by hand or work on them in illustrator then print and use my projector. I think its a fun tool to have but it was once of the last big things I purchased. I went for my heat sealer Silhouette Cameo and airbrush all prior to a projector.,cookiedecorating,ckfx0xn,1,t5_2xe5x
3308738,0,t1_cp5e7lv,It was! The only thing that used food markers was the outlines on the cute heroes eyes. I use a little honey in my icing too to keep it softer and I like the way it handles better.,cookiedecorating,cp5f94c,2,t5_2xe5x

5905767,0,t3_3w0r10,I have to ask about your oven trick there.You put the cookies in the oven with just the light on when the color gets splotchy? I find this always happen when I make red iced cookies.,cookiedecorating,cxts2qc,1,t5_2xe5x

6568396,0,t3_45lzyv,I got the hang of outliningflooding instantly but piping is another monster altogether. LOL Icing consistency is going to be my steepest learning curve but I already learned a lot! ,cookiedecorating,czyq5um,2,t5_2xe5x
6768704,0,t3_48gx2p,You can prepare and refrigerate your cookie batter Wednesday cut and bake Thursday and decorate Friday. I make frosteddecorated sugar cookies and this is my routine. Dough has to set cookies have to cool and icing has to harden. Best of luck! ,cookiedecorating,d0jihap,3,t5_2xe5x

11403529,0,t3_62pogd,My husband is going to build me a wheeled baking cart that I can move around. Its going to have a food grade butcher block top two big drawers and a shelf on top of the drawers with a railing going around to keep my flours and sugars on it. Im going to put as much stuff in the drawers as possible so everything is in one place. Currently Ive got my baking station which is a little stretch of counter between the fridge and stove. My mixer sits there and my pans are in the cabinet below and my flours sugars chocolate chips etc are above. Then Ive got my actual tools and decorating supplies in a cabinet in the laundry room which is off the kitchen. And finally my cookie cutters are in little drawer organizers in the garage with labels on them. Im looking forward to finally having my cart.,cookiedecorating,dfokqgd,5,t5_2xe5x
