5525627,0,t1_cwhv9a5,Ah right that thing Ive become completely desensitized to it because I never disable my own extension You can set up the Chrome Web Store to publish it as a private or unlisted extension. Though I really doubt the author would care if you published it publicly Id imagine hed want as many people as possible to get use from it.You could try reaching out to him on Twitter or something. Theres a umikejchin ping! still active on reddit who joined around that timeframe  was it him?EDIT If it is hes a founder of Boomerang for Gmail one of my favorite extensions... Sweet.,chrome_extensions,cwhy5lv,1,t5_2r4qy
