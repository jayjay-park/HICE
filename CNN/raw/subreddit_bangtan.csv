5720676,0,t3_3tehuv,I just want to say saving your individual receipt of a purchase of  or  albums isnt going to make a big difference. If you participate in a big group order you should tell the leader of that group order to save the receipt but otherwise saying  albums were bought in the U.S.! when the problem is the spike in sales of k albums it wont make a difference. Plus the people accusing BTS of this dont really care about the facts they just want to find a way to tear down a group that seems to be doing better than theirs last time this was because of salty Big Bang fans. Netizens ultimately were even able to somehow come to a rational conclusion last time.,bangtan,cx67fmr,1,t5_2zqih

I found out about BTS through a React to video KPOP by fine brothers entertainment that Dan and Phil were doing. They were playing DOPE and I found my selft watching the video over and over in the next week...Then bought the album and it went from there haha. I was able to catch the full season of the TV show they did in america and thought they were cool after seeing them in real life.

6177708,0,t1_cyrp0l7,I dunno if youve already found out what Crow Tit was about but this video translates it pretty well with all the cultural notes in the video description haha.  My quick summary of the song would be theyre using the Korean saying of if a crow tit which has very short legs tries to walk like a stork which has very long legs theyll break their legs basically meaning dont pretend to be something youre not or youll ruin yourself. The old generation is the stork and the new generation is the crow tit. The old generation stork keeps yelling at the new generation for not doing things the exact same way as them but the new generation keeps replying doing things the same way as you will ruin us because your methods dont work anymore. Its a timeless tale probably relatable in almost every country to some extent but in Korea the generational divide is probably more prominent since they recently became industrialized ss ish.  EDIT and yeah Im sure once you mention learning Korean yourself to these fans who complain about BTS not knowing English theyll get quiet realllly quickly. Or theyll start learning Korean and realize how hard it is.,bangtan,cyruald,3,t5_2zqih

6263038,0,t3_41dj1f,Oh...oh dear. I dont even have words for this. This isnt the first time Yoongi has written an essay of his feelings so thats not something to be worried about. Of all the people...hes the person who has his own principles very blunt to the extent that its not good anymorehe said so himself and is responsible with his actions. He knows what hes doing he knows that this isnt a perfect time to ruin their efforts by getting into a dating scandal. Of all the people...I thought we all know by now to trust Yoongi. Hes revealed a lot of things about himself despite being someone who likes to be alone with himself and his thoughts.Im going to be honest here. Im disappointed that people would still believe in these rumourswithout concrete proof at that. Rumours are normal to arise in a fandom but its also our responsibility to be mature about this so as not to hurt our boys and the fandom as well. Most importantly Im really disappointed that by believing these rumours people have discredited Yoongis genuine efforts to open up his heart to his fans even though its probably a struggle for him.

Even when the spotlight isnt on him he is putting out  effortand looking amazing and that is the most impressive thing to me.Random example is the end of Fire.

And yes I like his dad jokes. They are the best.Edit I almost forgot to mention I think I would get on well with Hoseok too. I think many people would though.

The MVs are a lot more impressive than western ones are these days as well. Plus the sound of the language is beautiful and we can look up lyrics.

About sales record legitimately speaking EXO still holds the record. But let consider this EXO have set up an extremely large fanbase in China and as you know Chinese masters and fans in general are pretty wellknown for lavishly paying for albums in order to win tickets to a fansign. Meanwhile BTS hasnt performed any huge promotional campaign in this money making area so its understandable that they cannot exceed EXO in selling physical records.

9341483,0,t1_d8zyxdq,I find a dance practice likely but probably not an MV. Have there been cases where a group has already performed other songs other that their title tracks during main promotions and then dropped an MV for them for a followup? I know Monsta X did it with Hero but they remixed the song and changed the choreo a bit so I dont know if that counts. The only other group songs we have in WINGS are ! ! and the Interlude but we never know with BigHit.,bangtan,d903mhc,9,t5_2zqih
9354549,0,t1_d91jz5r,Yeah its no problem I like talking about it basically I can be really biased towards songs that sound like my favourite colours and I find I like kpop because I can just listen to the colours of their voices and not the wordsIm Yoongi biased and his voice is like a deep blue that I love but jimin light bluepink and jhope green are close seconds... even in real life I form opinions on people based on what colour I see their voicesSo yeah listening to music is a really vivid experience for me... sometimes when songs have too much happening I get distracted. My favourite song on WINGS is MAMA because its like a pastel pink mint green yellow combination thats really pretty you can ask about any song lol and I can tell you,bangtan,d91r87n,2,t5_2zqih

9364734,0,t3_58gnb9,Thank you for spilling this out. Its definitely refreshing to hear things like these. And yes we ARE Bangtan and the boys especially RM never fail to point out how much they value us. I think thats one of the reasons why I chose to stay and invest in this fandom because theres that fellowship. Other groups not trying to demean them though felt quite distant? I mean hey ARMY are kinda outspoken plus we get rowdy a few times but thats whats keeping us tight.At first I was a casual BTS fan but then they just kept bombarding me every comeback. Songs that come from the heart...just wow. I vividly remember when they cameback with HYYH pt.  and I was taking my licensure exam. Listened to Move and these big fat tears started rolling down my cheeks bloody hell. As much as theyre idols and everything we relate to them at such an intimate level. Im never going to desert these boys and as Agust D says I will be there for your creation until the end of your life. Peace out yo. ,bangtan,d931pei,1,t5_2zqih
9373040,0,t1_d9430sw,sorry I hope I didnt come out too strong when talking about the song. I just have nowhere else to talk about my BTS feels so I get a bit carried away over here. I get that sometimes a song just doesnt click for you and it can be pretty tough to handle if everyone else is raving about itI actually havent been an ARMY very long but I found Bangtan when I was going through a REALLY lousy time in my life. Im still dealing with it so unlike many other people I see online I dont relate to the lyrics from an ARMY point of view I wasnt even around for most of the controversies and even so I tend to stay the heck away from this stuff but from the part in my personal life where BTS songs kind of picked me up and made me trust in myself again.Crap Im getting sappy and oversharing again sorry gtlt,bangtan,d943l6r,1,t5_2zqih

9450687,0,t1_d9dxcvx,I actually am also grateful for fans standing up for them. In the kpop industry there have been cases of people not being treated in a really nice way. For instance I was glad fans stood up when they had a manager who seemed to be too harsh on them or when they caught the staff woman smoking in a room near Jimin. Some might think its too much but smoking next to a young singer who doesnt smoke and in a closed area is a problem. People really underestimate what smoking does and its hard to believe it was a one time event. I just wish people would consider the situation and the context twice before acting. In Flower Crew context it was unfortunate we just got to see a cut and had no clue about what was going on and about the fact that they were all pretty nice to JK. But bashing and attacking them without giving them the benefit of the doubt was too much.,bangtan,d9dxw8f,5,t5_2zqih

10066186,0,t3_5jvxwf,I honestly dont know.  Ive always thought RM has has the most sex appeal.  Hes just super sexy all the time it doesnt matter what hes doing so I really dont know why more people arent falling over themselves for him.  I do think it has to do a bit with fan age.  I find a lot of older fans tend to stan the hyung line.  Nearly all of my freinds are hyung line biased.For Jin I think its definitely lack of exposure but I think this past year hes been getting a lot more so more and more people are warming up to him.  I am guilty of this as well.  Jin was the member I knew the least about but now I just adore him.  I love that his dorky personality is allowed to shine and they arent trying to make him a badass.   was the year of Yoongi and  was the year of Jin.  I predict  will be the year of RM.  I predict hes going to do a lot of great things this year and will finally start getting the recognition he deserves.,bangtan,dbjnb5w,8,t5_2zqih

10076472,0,t1_dbkxci4,It was a cover of a Shinwha song. Which makes the whole accusation that he gets more shit because of it more hilarious. It ignores that if you make him take the blame for covering the song without changing that part you have to also blame the other members and Shinwha both things that I never or rarely see happening. The members knew hed perform it that way because of the original and the rehearsal and Shinwha still performed it that style for some time before and after BTS cover. Im not saying that you should excuse it but am criticizing the biased judgment where neutrality should reign because its not about the group itself but awareness on a certain matter. But I could probably guess correctly that anyone reading this argument of mine would have immediately tried to protect the other members with but who knows if they werent against it but RM or the management thought their complaints were unimportant even though you could use exactly that same argument to protect RM. Or in case you want to show another side of the coin for the whole group hethey couldnt just change the lyrics of such an old and respected group even more as nugus.The point the comment about Suga amp Jin was trying to make was just that there is a difference in judgment and no sadly it doesnt have to do with RM being more problematic. He wasnt. There are enough other cases from past to present to showcase the others to have done the same other or even more dumb problematic stuff. And in case it wasnt clear This is neither protecting nor attacking but trying to bring a glimmer of neutrality and equal judgment into fandom.,bangtan,dbkzhqf,1,t5_2zqih

Seeing Armys go it was nice Jungkook got his solo but when will BigHit let us see Jins and JHopes talentwhy does BigHit keep ignoring how talented Jin and JHope arestop sleeping on hyung line or just outright bashing maknae line is utterly ridiculous. We should not be pitting the members against each other like this. Its one thing to think your bias is not getting enough screentime but I was not a fan of people ignoring Jungkooks excellent performance in favor of complaining about how someone else could have done it instead or he should have split up his lines with other members. Like that is not cool at all. Why cant you just show your pride for Jungkook doing an excellent job instead of finding something to be negative about.

I get that some wouldnt mind bout the novel and since fans are really good promoters it caught the attention of the author.

10385293,0,t1_dckvx95,I feel like we keep pushing around what aspect of closed off culture were talking about. Initially I said that its lame that melon is like this but I understood why its just the layering affect of the fact that in so many ways these companies are definitely pushing for worldwide fame yet treat intl fans like a ways to a mean which is in fact what we are. We were on the same page but now were back to talking about the music streaming??Im not really focusing on that aspect at this point but more the general idea of the way intl fans are treated. Itd be nice if melon was a bit more open but Im definitely not expecting it. Thats a music program thats dedicated to more than just kpop in a lot of ways its understandable when you think about it in the mindset of fans listening to non Korean music on it. I get it. In fact Im not expecting anything from anyone theyre not going to change but that doesnt mean I cant find it off putting or stupid. Definitely doesnt mean that I cant disagree with what theyre doing or their reasonings behind it. Despite how popular kpop gets and whatever little things they give here and there theres still this isolation of intl fans and I think its stupid thats what my point was.,bangtan,dcl8jy1,1,t5_2zqih

Theres also a shit ton more fans from other fandoms coming to ARMYs defense which is a dramatic change just in the last year alone. Like you also mentioned with the concert  near impossible to grab a ticket. I did but its one of the top nosebleed seats and I paid  for it hahah. I had to go through a third party seller and even that price was generous. For the Muster seats were canceling by this time. Were now only  days out and its still completely sold out.

Lol Ph ARMYs Im pertaining to Allan K. Haha connections like this feel weird.Recently into NCT. I had fun watching their reality show and v lives.

But BigBang didnt invent the SMPTE color bars.I cant search for a bunch of examples right now but I know for sure that so many different bands YouTubers TV shows etc have used those color bars before.The only example I can think of off the top of my head is the red carpet from the  VMAs was the color bars and the backdrop was an old TV.

Even them watching someone else play a horror game. I might pay good money to see them experience a horror game.

10970005,0,t1_debgurz,The thing is I dont believe there was no organiser willing to take on BTS concerts in Europe. And even if they werent contacted after the Kcon in France or after the Huge success of WINGS in Europe or after again the huge success of YNWA it is all very unlikely if they were interested in Europe they would have contacted the organisers themselves probably eliciting a positive response. If they did not BigHit made a mistake underestimating BTS popularity here. There may have been other reasons ie they plan to have another comeback for JulyAugust and there would be no time for the tour to take up Europe even if in that case one could argue that two stops would not really hurt their schedule and we still dont know it they really plan avoiding Europe. What I am saying is if they really dont come here they are responsible for it not the concerts organisers or the inaccessibility? of Europe.Edit to answer the latter part I dont see why anyone would think BTS should not be able to sell out big venues which is the motif behind my first post BTS is big in many parts of Europe and people within Europe can move pretty much at will and other Kpop artists have sold big without having the huge fame and accomplishments  Bangtan has here. Even if they only wanted to organise one concert both BigHit and the organisers would have no reason to believe it wouldnt sell well also because since its probably? their first concert in Europe they would have to reserve a number of seats not for commercial use.,bangtan,debh8hy,2,t5_2zqih

11062015,0,t3_5xekp8,Wore my NOPE NOT TODAY shirt at work and it was a hit. Mainly because I work at a call center with a huge number of understandably pissed off customers calling in. Im... lowkey worried if I should look for a new job. But I love my crew and coworkers so much. My company is surprisingly small. The funny thing is I think we have a few hundred more employees than BigHit.Its really weird. Less than a month ago I thought Id retire at this job. Now I literally have NO idea whats happening  months from now. Im not even scared? It hit me how passionate I am about this stupid job and this stupid industry. I sit for  hours while customers drop fbombs at me. Im not scared cause I can find another job but it wont pay as much. As mousy as I am this job made me tougher.Big Hit how do you do it? The amount of work behind the scenes is insane. Getting out preordeed cds making sure the website does currency changes correctly the people on tour doing the sets the lighting and sound people wardrobe and makeup noonas camera operators holy shit THOSE POOR ACCOUNTANTS how do they handle it all?The idea that such a small company can consistently churn out highquality content is amazing.Its funny I go to work on days I cant stand it because I know our call center is overwhelmed and I just cant let my coworkers drown in the call queue. A bad call feels like youre drowning. Its hard to breathe. My one customer basically crossexamined me on the phone while placing the order. What should have been  minutes took half an hour. I nearly cried but I didnt.Imagine if I threw myself fullthrottle into something I really really cared about. I dont know where Im going with this.

Wings never felt complete to me. The conflicts presented in the solo songs and even some of the group songs were never resolved. Adding the last few songs provides a resolution. At first the members are alone exposing the problems they are dealing with. They also exposed the problems they encountered together in BST and the problems experienced by society in Am I Wrong. Then in Spring Day Not Today and Supplementary Story they come together to sing about how they can overcome everything together. After all Spring Day looking at it just lyrically is a song about friendship. Not Today is about collective action.

11664759,0,t1_dgi6yrn,That makes sense but its still super frustrating. Hopefully theyll fix it soon because I honestly doubt they want our fandom to constantly spam them about this issue. On the brighter side JREs reaction got uncopyrighted is this even a word? so hopefully theyll start to manage this problem. Tbh its wouldnt have been this big of an issue if it was just reaction videos but the fact that they blocked music covers dance covers edits and other videos relating to bst made me extremely irritated. Thank you so much for this explanation though cause its been driving me nuts this whole time. Them taking control of the Korean content though inadvertently which is not what they manage looks pretty illegal and petty to me as well because of the fact that the BB award is coming up in less than two weeks which is based on their social media was worrying me too.EDIT Them taking down lyric videos annoyed me too due to the fact that BTS lyrics are so poetic and the fact that majority of the people on youtube speak english and thus look for lyrics videos ,bangtan,dgi7rmi,3,t5_2zqih
