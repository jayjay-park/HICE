9532701,0,t1_d9o35oy,At least sniper requires a bit more aiming skill. Just standing waiting with flame for people to pass by is too easy P Regardless there certainly has been a shift with the introduction of the grim reaper skin.,slayone,d9o3sw2,1,t5_3exas

I really think this type of modification is OK it doesnt give anyone any kind of gameplay advantage.,slayone,d9t7v23,1,t5_3exas

9663113,0,t1_da46b0r,WHAT!? I though range is how big the area of effect because of the he grenade. Because when i use it i never upgrade range because actually only with some damage upgrade  it does what it should do.And actually there is no reason to throw it that far. Without accurate throwing grenade will miss the enemy and do nothing and of cousre almost every player cant throw and hit the enemy in far distance.And they bound off ground and wall so they really goes far without any upgrade.He grenade also should have radius instead of range.,slayone,da46iyd,1,t5_3exas

10058264,0,t3_5jqk9c,This could be pretty difficult to get right with code and make things worse. But whats worse splat? No UI at all.This is a skill issue your mouse does not have to be on the target to kill them only aligned for the shot. Meaning dont cram the mouse into the corners of the screen. Get used to knowing where people are for the shot without seeing them.,slayone,dbim6xc,1,t5_3exas
10609054,0,t1_dd7a83n,But Shotgun is different from other guns it do great damage when approached to enemy.But with grenade launcher you can jump obstacle and it got a radius of shooting so... why not add a new weapon like grapplin,slayone,dda8qwk,1,t5_3exas
