4085281,0,t3_362dq8,Is this a new job? Are you wearing garments you arent used to? Has the nature of your work changed? Have you started perspirating more than usual? Why? If you have been working this job for a while and this has never happened before you may want to investigate further.Otherwise consider wearing undergarments and work clothes with breathable material that are not too tightly fitted you should be able to bend and stretch and do full range of motion without the clothes rubbing roughly against your skin. A rash cream could be considered but perhaps try tackling the basic problem at hand first. If it is a case of excessive sweat and irritation from that sweat could you air out the area on bathroom breaks and gently really do be gentle to prevent microtears pat it dry with tissue paper? Could you try a change in diet if something in your current one is causing you to sweat more? Just some starting points to tackle the problem.,menshealth,crly49q,1,t5_2qp1o
7872980,0,t3_4n3o4b,Technically phimosis should not be diagnosed until age What youre seeing may not be smegma a beneficial though unappetizing substance that is watersoluble and rinses away easily.When you were born your foreskin was bonded to your glans much the way a nail is bonded to a finger. The fibers called synechia dissolve over time. I suspect youre seeing the remnants of synechia.Gentle treatment is called for. I have found that soap is too harsh for the membranes of the glans and inner foreskin and that infrequent rinsings with water only help protect against dehydration. You may find that pure aloe gel under the foreskin will keep it moist and aid in the dissolution of the synechia.,menshealth,d40zufe,1,t5_2qp1o
