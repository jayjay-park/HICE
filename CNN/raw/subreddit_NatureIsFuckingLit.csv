9837234,0,t1_dapstk6,There arent any other rumors as far as I know. The legend of the Kraken and other large octopuses probably came from early observations of GPOs or just human imagination seeing an octopus and imagining a gigantic one.Octopuses are crazy smart. They are very good at solving puzzles like locked boxes and we had several that were escape artists. My favorite story is from one day when our power was out. We were depending on backup power for the basics but a lot of secondary things were shut off. One of the GPOs jammed herself into the water outtake in her tank and blocked it. The tank overflowed which gave her the opportunity to ride a frickin waterfall out of the tank. We found her in time and got her back in the water  they can only survive a couple hours at the most in open air. Cuttlefish are known to be relatively intelligent  they can solve some simple puzzles. Squids are dumb. Or maybe thats not exactly fair  they havent shown intelligence in the same way other cephalopods have so theyre not smart following the general definition we have. For example were able to teach octopuses and cuttlefish to target feed. They figure out that when they see a striped stick they can touch it and receive food. We tried a lot to get Bigfin Reef Squid to learn the same thing and didnt have a lot of success. They only live a short time though  months at the most so its really hard to teach them anything.,NatureIsFuckingLit,daptbn4,2,t5_3gdh7

For what its worth I went in February they told us the bay water was unseasonably cold like  degrees or something still super warm if youre used to any other nontropical water and it was affecting the bioluminescence. It still seemed crazy bright though. Also I dont want to sound too rHailCorporate but we used JAK watersports for the tour with glass bottomed kayaks and our tour guide was not only extremely cool  informative and spoke excellent english and frequently switched back to spanish for  locals who were there but we also ran into him at a bar later that night and he proved to be one of the coolest dudes I met in PR.I would say the most important part of doing the bioluminescent bay tour is moonphase or moonset time.

We cant act like were better than this place just because weve developed past that now for the most part.Its like adults who scoff at what teenagers do knowing damn well they did the same shit at that age too. Also those laws have exceptions and are relatively young. Look up the fairmont in lake Louise or even the entire town of Banff both are situated in protected national parks.  There are many other examples like this and they have an exception because the places were built before the laws took effect so now they are allowed to renovate the buildings and continue to operate them despite their effect on the park.

11706675,0,t3_66xfiv,Got myself a gray nearly two years ago. If youre a bird person its a great decision. Smartest parrots on the planet. Theyre lovable and pick up wordsword association for sentences really quickly. Only problem I ran into was dominance during adolescence. I have a Congo this one in the video looks to be a Timneh. Not just because its small but the gray looks darker. Theyre wonderful pets. Requires A LOT of attention though. What I love about these guys the most are theyre LIFETIME companions. If you fall in love with birdsbird keeping. Get a gray as your pal. They live up to  years old. Literally once you get out of college. Get one of these guys if youre looking into getting a pet. Do your own research first. ,NatureIsFuckingLit,dgmzadm,2,t5_3gdh7

11717890,0,t1_dgo75jt,The best method to stay alive is to have someone breathe for you via mouth to mouth or be hooked up to a machine in a hospital to breathe for you because the venom itself paralyzes your lungs so you cant breathe. Youre completely conscious the whole time though you just can in no way breathe. Your body eventually flushes out the toxins if youre kept alive long enough. ,NatureIsFuckingLit,dgo92uo,12,t5_3gdh7
