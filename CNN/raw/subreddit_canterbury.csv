10369941,0,t3_5ohvg3,Sometimes the traffic creates a real problem for local people.The essence of the issue is that there are so many carparks in the centre of town that lead to everyone abandoning the park and ride service which is excellent locally.Taxis are a better solution for visitors to Canterbury.. i would say that the solution to Canterburys traffic problems would be to have a scheme of parking that is restricted to residents and services locally and all others having to use park and ride services.Hopefully thats not too political.,canterbury,dcjhtm8,2,t5_2sbso
