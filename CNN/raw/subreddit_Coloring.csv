10883185,0,t3_5u516c,I like colouring landscapes but I definitely know what you mean it can be limiting feeling like you have to do things the proper colours. At the moment Im really enjoying the pop manga colouring book because Ive found I can colour anything any colour and itll look good.  In fact it looks so much better when you do it crazy colours rather than normal ones.,Coloring,de2iue8,1,t5_2snhh
10970080,0,t1_debc3yi,Thanks again for all of your info. Sorry to double reply but Ive got one more ques go one more question if you dont mind. I was just wondering if you had tried any of their other books and if any had more portraits or if there were any others you liked better?Oh and I took a peek through your submissions and I absolutely love your style ! I was wondering what you use to color with and how you blend? Ive just gotten the  set of prismacolors and love them but my blending doee not compare at all. I definitely cant get new pencils but I could get something else to blend. Thanks again for all the info!,Coloring,debhiik,1,t5_2snhh
