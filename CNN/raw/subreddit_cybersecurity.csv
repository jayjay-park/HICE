6535537,0,t3_44gbtg,Im reading Ted Koppels book Lights Out about this very topic. Its a bit alarmist for the first couple of chapters. Hopefully it gets a little less hypefearmongering and a little more investigative.  Sure its something to be concerned about and to be taken seriously but Koppels writing style so far is laden with emotion.,cybersecurity,czvbs34,1,t5_2u559

IoT Village does an event where companies send their equipment in to be tested by some of the top hackers to see where the vulnerabilities are and its a slippery slope from slightly vulnerable to extremely vulnerable.

9423806,0,t1_d935ho3,Late to the party will probably only be seen by you uMaxVision.  But wanted to say I agree .  The only other attribute I would add would be patience.  Security folks have a strong tendency to drink their own KoolAid and act like the world is going to end if the business doesnt do X Y and Z.  And then take it personally when the business decides to accept the risk or do A B and C instead.  The frustration and outright anger I have seen has been ridiculous and downright misplaced.  You want to be successful longterm?  Understand that its not about you and that your role is SME to support the business.To springboard from your comment about business is always more important that security I would reframe it less cynically and say that security supports the business and as such the cost of new capabilities needs to be proportional back to the Risk Management piece.  But I emphatically agree with your recommendations.  uTwinkie comment aside you cited critical skills that are frequently missing.
