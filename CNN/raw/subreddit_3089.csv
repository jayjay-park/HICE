149275,0,t3_1vmw85,I hope Phrt answers this.  Id also like to see having single quests shared even if doubling the objective criteria so that players progress together rather than separately e.g. all players complete the first objective before the quest progresses to the second all objectives share one HUD marker color and can be completed by either player.  Currently if the mission has restrictions especially on the next objective you can fail your mission by attackingkilling the other players targets which is pretty lame.  Being penalized for trying to help the other player only detracts from the cooperative experience.,3089,cevfls2,2,t5_2v0h5
153534,0,t3_1vmw85, player coop was a relatively early design decision based on how most multiplayer games were played in . Most people just played with  players and they wanted to play cooperatively  so I designed  to focus on a tight coop experience between  players. Basically I put a ton of resources into making sure gt player multiplayer would work in  with dedicated servers and it was underutilized greatly.,3089,cevx3cq,1,t5_2v0h5
