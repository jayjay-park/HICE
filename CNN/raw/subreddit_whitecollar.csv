76380,0,t1_cen18kk,Thats a very fair point. Although do we not have dialogue pertaining to both His prior arrest rate being very high and him being highly regarded and to Neal regarding him as an equal and the only person capable of catching him? ,whitecollar,cen4ho8,1,t5_2s1ur

1046026,0,t1_chn6aij,That makes me so happy to hear. Im so glad that in truly such a short time together they have made such a connection together. Ill always remember the first commercial I saw for white collar and it hooked me immediately. Mr. Bomers personality drew so much character so beautifully to Neil. As well as everyone else on set they were all perfect. The relationship they showed on screen showed that it was the same off. Love them all to death. Of course Matt and his handsome self a little more. Ahem. Cough straight male cough. Ahem.  ,whitecollar,chn6rzj,4,t5_2s1ur

2591193,0,t1_cmsr2v1,gt Im still baffled at the Pink Panthers not knowing about Peter Burke being an FBI agent.I chock this up to just poor rushed writing. The most baffling thing to me this season is why in the hell does Mozzie want in on the Pink Panthers? Neal and Peter are only working with them to take them down and he knows this. Its incredibly risky to actually want a piece of this score more than he can get by just helping Neal from the sidelines like hes doing. And its insane to reveal your identity to the group right before you deliver them to the FBI if you dont have to.Although I suppose in a world where the Pink Panthers dont know that Neal is Peters CI Mozzie has nothing to fear from them.,whitecollar,cmwt0w0,1,t5_2s1ur

3244896,0,t3_2xa6iu,I prefer Suits over Psych. A bit darker but I also enjoy The Blacklist. Honestly its James Spader that makes it watchable though other performers hold their own but Spader shines.,whitecollar,coycavz,9,t5_2s1ur

4598690,0,t1_csuemcc,I also think hes consulting. Think about it. To make a living being a thief in the art world you need connections. You need buyers. You need fences. You need reputations. You need names. Hes hiding from everyone and anyone at this point both legitimate and criminal. Criminals are inherently unreliable. Knowing all this could he honestly be stealing from the Louvre the art museum of all art museums and not expect to attract any attention? If anything Burke would find out about it eventually and if anyone in the underworld finds out theyd go after Mozzie and Peter. I think the implication is strong that hes now doing legit work. After all Caffrey says to Burke at some point that his job at the FBI tickles him just fine because he getsto have all the thrill of the crime by getting to think about how the thieves did it. Being a privatesecurity consultant could do the same for him and keep him under the radar.,whitecollar,cta96lu,1,t5_2s1ur

9981075,0,t1_db8akjl,Agreed. I get shows like openendings but I found it too weird here. Honestly I didnt really like the last season that much since I had a feeling it wouldnt end well. I would have rather seen Neal end up free and get to stay in NYC since he wanted to be there.,whitecollar,db8k954,1,t5_2s1ur
