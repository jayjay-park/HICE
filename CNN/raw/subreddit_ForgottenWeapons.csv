3317252,0,t3_2y3yel,It depends on the type of conversion done. Some kept the loading lever in place and some replaced it with an SAAstyle ejector rod. I dont know of any that repurposed it as an ejector since it would be pushing cases into the center of the frame.,ForgottenWeapons,cp6e85n,2,t5_33iw5

9965900,0,t3_5i7yra,Posted this first in the comments for the video but I feel it could go here as well.  Mil Spec difficulty for that stage   Indoors Low Light or Outside Low Light.   Shooter is provided MX Flashlight.  Firing from strong side hand only.   Weak side hand must hold and aim flashlight on target while engaging targets illumination through the entirety of the course is not required but highly recommended.  Tunnel design should have two dead ends one which should contain Enemy Intel in the form of a poster of Jane Fonda or square of cloth representing a cloth map random selection of dead end with the intel will be done by the RO.   Retrieving the Intel will give a  second bonus.,ForgottenWeapons,db6kzps,1,t5_33iw5
