7942125,0,t1_d44tydh,Some Muni question I remember  It was asking for something along the lines of the definition of a municipal bond that has multiple sources of funding Doublebarreled bond.  It gave a snippet of information on a Muni underwriting which had the percentages for each participating member such as the managing under writer syndicate etc and the total amount of money used in the underwriting. For my question I believed it asked me how much money the managing underwriter would get.  There was a question about municipal notes it asked what type of financing they were used for. It had two very similar answers I think one of them said just short term and the other had both the words shortterm and interim financing.  There was a question about the MSRB principal or something related to that.  There was a question that asked in an underwriting who got the concessionor takedown I dont remember.  There was a question that had you determine what was being funded by user fees or taxes one of the choices on there was a turnpike.  There was a question that gave the definition of amortization and asked what it was amortization and accretion were two choices as possible answers.  Dont remember if this specifically had to do with a Muni bond but there was a question asking about the delivery date. I remembered many more questions right after I took mine but Im starting to forget a lot of it hope that helped.,Series7exam,d48row9,1,t5_383rm
