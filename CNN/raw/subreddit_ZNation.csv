5349199,0,t3_3o9xhs,Compared to Fear The Walking Dead this show deserves an Emmy.  Its fucking hysterical and intense all at the same time.  That cheese wheel was a stroke of genius as was the baby crawling out of the womb. I really appreciate anyone who thinks this shit up. Bravo.edit  Im also going to say that I was watching this show alone at the beginning at my house and before it ended I had  people sitting down to watch the show.  Riveting I say!,ZNation,cvvf5a8,9,t5_319rh

5985707,0,t1_cy45arv,Really makes it clear what a great actor he is. The way things are written Id almost be worried for the character. Weve already got multiple possible replacements for miracle zombie semicure around now. But hes so damn good in the role that the people in charge would have to be insane to even consider letting him go. ,ZNation,cy49abb,16,t5_319rh
6003081,0,t3_3xlhov,It seemed to me he was seeing a reflection of himself for some reason. With this show..it can be anything. Maybe some tribe or maybe a ghost of his future self will carry him and the dog to safety or he never left the base or he stumbled into aliens and they will teleport him to operation bite mark. Really with this show ANYTHING can happen.,ZNation,cy6j8f7,1,t5_319rh

6318561,0,t1_cz7iq24,I miss that Giant Cheese Wheel.  I was really hoping for some sort of post credits clip of the cheese wheel traveling the country side on its way to the Gulf.  Or and I knew this was a stretch for the Giant Cheese wheel to show up and save the day.  I like that the show seems to not have a firm foot on what it is. Its seriousdrama hilariouscampy.  A lot of times these tones are all wrapped up in a single episode.  And the humor changes too.  One of my favorite scenes is Murphy showing Addy how he got two zombie strippers to makeout.  But I like the weird awkward moments as well.  Like Addy giving K condoms after he woke up from his anthrax coma.  I watch this show and The Walking Dead.  I can honestly not pick a favorite.  I guess if anything I want to watch Z Nation while with TWD I feel more invested to see it through.  I will say I prefer the fan base on the subreddit for Z Nation over that on TWD.  Both shows are great but both have flaws. Like TWD has great makeup and special effects. I wish Z Nation had that but the way this show uses what it has works well.  Like the truck crashing scene in se.  Or even the ridiculous green screen explosions.  Its done in a way that makes the viewer want to laugh instead of scoff.  TWD could never get away with low budget special effects like the way Z Nation can.  I feel like Z Nation has better pacing.  TWD this season was moving along great till they hit a cliff hanger death that lasted like four episodes.  All the momentum they built was ruined.  It happened with Fear the Walking Dead too.  The outbreak finally starts at the end of an episode and then they decide to skip to  days later in the next episode.  That was infuriating.  Z Nation just handles cliff hangers better and has a better pace between the episodes throughout the season.  Though I wouldnt mind an entire episode dedicated to the Giant Cheese Wheel.  He could have been Z Nations Morgan character.  ,ZNation,cz7um27,4,t5_319rh

About tons and tons of biologicalengineered things that eat anything but metal and glass. Cheap way to dispose of trash and makes for some super cheap meat.....But then they all get loose somehow and start eating everything. ,ZNation,czeucot,2,t5_319rh

I am thoroughly confused the episode was a mind fuck a good one but not a episode I would watch again even if I have no clue what happened.. I got the ending though at first I thought the creek was poisonoushallucinogenic even more so when Mack woke up by it.,ZNation,d3tjglh,1,t5_319rh

9521330,0,t3_5b7shw,The only thing I want to know is Why dont zombie birds kill everyone?  It seems like birds would be especially well adapted animal zombies.

11041214,0,t1_deiy2t1,I cant remember if he ate brains in Mexico but during the episode with the collector in season  the collector force feeds him a piece of brain as an experiment.

11079892,0,t3_5y55ur,IMHO Warren and Murphy are both a little off the deep end.  Murphy is a eating people and b refuses to let Sun Mei try to develop a vaccine that works without making people into slaves.
