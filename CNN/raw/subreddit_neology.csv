996237,0,t3_24zp5u,metasuffixion mehTAHsuhfikshunDerivationmeta here meaning change  suffixion the process or act of adding a piece to the end of a word hence the process or act of changing a words ending i.e. everything but its first letter.More particularly the word is meant to echo metonymy which refers to the similar phenomenon of referring to something by the name of something else that is associated with it in some way. Metonymy from meta  onymia literally means change of name. In this case one way to look at it is that you are not changing the entire name but simply that part of it that follows the first letter hence metasuffixion.Potential objectionsmeta is a Greek prefix while suffixion derives from Latin. Generally I find such conjunction suboptimal. However in this case meta is motivated by the parallel with metonymy hence not mutasuffixion while suffixion is motivated by the fact that the English language does not possess a familiar Greek root denoting the latter part of a word metacatalexis would be unintelligible if not outright confusing to most English speakers see further below.PronunciationPrimary accent on the second syllable rather than the first in order to strengthen the connection with metonymy.AlternativesIf youd like to avoid hybridizing roots from different languages you might use metacatalexis or metacatalexia instead metasuffixing metasuffixion itself now thats meta! with the Greek for suffix As for which of the two endings s or a would be more appropriate this requires further research which as I am tired I will not do at the present time. In either case however its worth noting that catalexis in English has an entirely different meaning which may be an argument against reimporting it to denote a suffix.,neology,chhj2jq,1,t5_2snyc
