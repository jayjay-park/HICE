3975602,0,t3_34i8mv,I think youre scaring a few people by using acronyms that already mean something in a different context. LTS aka CS formula would be very competitive and spectator friendly. The TO part is probably what needs some clarification. Since all the Team objectives in our familiar game of Chivalry are long and for many require multiple deaths to complete I understand the reservation. It just has to be something on a smaller scale. Something akin to  Plant the Bomb but with a medieval twist would be awesome! Light  put out the pyre probably fits the best but Im voting for Drink the mead,TheSlashering,cr9gai1,2,t5_33ed9
4004614,0,t3_366sbi,It might be cool to try jumpattacks specially overheads and slashes with a small twist on the mechanic to make them look more realistic and tweak the physics to fully use the weight of the weapon compounded with some extra force. Im not sure if such mechanic was planned but here so it goes.Think of them as power attacks but theyd be triggered like a regular jump attack i.e. jump followed by a slashOH attack performed mid air same animation perhaps with a louder grunt. Youd use this mechanic to knock enemies further away when they parry or clash on HIT maybe theyd have no effect on dmg or a small  dmg bonus to headshots only. They could not be clashed with youd still be able to parry them but not follow with a riposte either or if clashable they could be used to CC more easily andor disarm your enemy. The downside to these are more stamina consumption and a much longer recovery phase compounded with world deflection hits ofc specially when missing. Also missing and hitting the ground with a jump attack would have a random chance to disarm you when low on stamina as another penalty. Finally release phases would be slightly shorter so they are not so draggable and therefore OP and weird as fuck.With shorter jump lengthsshorter air control which many seem to agree with to make Slasher look more realistic these power attacks would make for a pretty wicked combat tactic and a cool cinematic move.,TheSlashering,crcr9fs,1,t5_33ed9

4622800,0,t1_ctd9e75,stamina management is just an optimistic way of saying limiting a players actions in a fight not to mention this socalled skill that comes along with it is hardly even difficult or skillful. Do you really think that stamina management is more skillful than a game mechanic system that focuses on mechanical and reactionary skill? Obviously stamina management will always exist in Slasher as its not like were going to remove stamina from the game but that doesnt excuse slapping stamina costs on stuff when there are alternative ways to balance the games mechanics that dont limit a players actions.,TheSlashering,ctda18i,3,t5_33ed9

4969427,0,t1_cukwt2w,Im sure it works perfectly fine when you adjust to it but I hear different things about it every time. I really have to see it myself in the future instead of making what is basically my own conjecture based on the descriptions of testers here.I really want this system to work as well as possible seven or even eight binds for every preset attack or four with an alt bind is a serious pile of binds and I think its a nightmare for people who havent played CMW. The  system is much more intuitive and Im glad to hear you can get it working very well.,TheSlashering,cukxm0z,1,t5_33ed9
