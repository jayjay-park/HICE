65443,0,t1_celpmf3,I think pretty good.  While hes not gonna gain minutes from the Deng trade hell likely get more touches and assume a bigger offensive role hes proven hes capable.  Thibs loves the guy along with the rest of Chicago and for good reason so his minutes are always gonna be there as a reliable defensive big whos also capable on the offensive end.  The defensive mindset will earn him minutes especially at the end of games as hes an asset instead of a liability Boozer on the floor.Im a big Taj supporter and am currently going after him in several of my leagues.  I expect top production ROS with legitimate potential to crack top especially if Boozer sits out games or struggles with injuries as hes been known to.  Without Deng or Rose as viable outside options and primary ballhandlers I expect the Bulls to shift their play style feeding the big men down low more.  You could make the point that Gibson will be under more pressure and might take a slight dip in efficiency but hes got such a complete game with the ability to knock down a midrange jumper running hook in the lane or using his underrated footwork and quickness to get some easy dunks.  As you can tell I think Taj is an extremely underrated player both in real life and in fantasy.  I always thought he was a better asset than Asik back when they headed the Bulls Bench Mobb a couple years ago.  I think hes got a big opportunity to step up in Chicago over the next couple of months and Id be surprised if he didnt rise to the occasion.,fantasybball,celvpob,1,t5_2s5ct

91650,0,t1_ceot5tu,I definitely cannot disagree with anything you said here.  In Hensons case its a matter of the cream rising to the top.  His production is way too significant to ignore.  The problems I have with Sanders is where he fits on my team and the fact that I cannot stand to watch him play and I was really big on him coming out of VCU.  The main thing is that I own Giannis and Henson already already  more Bucks than I would like to own but Sanders really has no offensive game to speak of and is not a very good rebounder for a guy is size.  Of course since I am in first I can afford to be picky but I think Sanders is a guy best owned by teams that are not competing for a fantasy championship.TL DR Get Henson let someone else own Sanders unless youre desperateIm also watching the Bucks game right now and he just looks like a guy thats prepared to coast since he just got paid.,fantasybball,ceov3hr,1,t5_2s5ct

2335640,0,t1_cm06esq,I dont think the upkick in points fgm ftm and blocks would have been enough to outweigh the assists.  I would have been losing  assists a game.   assists a week. Which meant I would have lost my assists last week while not winning any of the other categories. One of the reasons Rondo is  is because hes coming off injury. Rondo is in a contract year and a tripledouble threat.  Hell get me rebounds assists points and steals.  Cousins is a doubledouble threat that would get me FGM Points Rebounds and FTM and BLK.   I am not strong enough in BLKs elsewhere for Cousinss added BLK to have helped me get over in that cat. Rondo is going to hurt you in FG and FT but those are not cats in my league.  While he will hurt in FGMissed the way scoring is going to work in my league is whomever wins FGMade will probably win PNTS also but lose FGmisssed. Thats a wash.  Therefore Boogies increase in FGmade and PTS doesnt mean as much as Rondos assists and rebounds from a guard do.  ,fantasybball,cm0ebww,1,t5_2s5ct
2336990,0,t1_cm0k3br,What if you consolidated a couple of your other centers into a better one? For example I would imagine DeAndre Jordan is highly rated under these league settings.

Then gives you nothing for the next  games. Sure he could prove me wrong but Turner is a fringe pickup in  man leagues. gt. I get down voted for providing actual facts and statistics. No its because you are acting like people who dont agree with your opinion are completely wrong. I acknowledge Turner may be just as good as you think he is I just dont find it likely. Hows this for actual facts and statistics Turner is a sub ft shooter who has averaged . points per game in his career while shooting  not very impressive. In addition he gives you about  TOgame far too high for that level of production. He will chip in a few assists and boards but nearly no steals and blocks. The only reason he even averaged .ptsgame is because he averaged nearly ppg in Philly two years ago which was one of the worst teams in league history and they let him chuck to his hearts content. Take that inflated season away and you are looking at a guy who isnt even over ppg in his career. Turner has been inconsistent and a poor shooter his entire career so your post  that he wont be inconsistent is misleading at best and could actually harm fantasy teams at worst. gtGo ahead and leave Turner in Free Agency I could care lessI certainly will leave him in FA. That being said your statement doesnt make any sense. I couldnt care less is what you mean.Proper use of what you saidgtI just won the lottery.

2804947,0,t1_cnmw1ki,I think that makes sense but its not necessarily only about depth. I think a large component of depth as a factor has to do with injuries which we both mentioned and the nature of the positions and I think the second one is pretty significant.Even on teams with multiple capable PFsCs they seem to split minutes a lot more evenly than PGs do. Perhaps this speaks to the higher degree of skillfinesse required at the PG position. Unless youre a refined post player like Duncan most good PFsCs these days are just guys that can block shots or clean up on boards which requires considerably less skill than ballhandling and running an offense which also explains why there are so many SGs available on wires  but thats a different debate. Perhaps its because posting up defending in the post and boxing out is more exhausting than ball handling and defending a guard which causes PFsCs to play fewer minutes.Regardless I agree that depth is important and partially accounts for some of these new PFsCs being available. But I think the actual requirements of the position is more of a driver as it trigger injuries within the position and make those positions more susceptible to minutesharing. Team depth is just a symptomoutcome of these factors.,fantasybball,cnmwvqm,5,t5_2s5ct

Ideally I do a  for  and trade up hence Q but if I cant make a trade go through who should I drop for PorterGreen or should I not even bother? What are your thoughts on DAngelo Russell?

Just because youre punting FT doesnt mean you should only have poor FT shooters in your team  only that you shouldnt care about whether someone is good at FT or not. Steph is elite in points threes assists and FG.  Dont trade him unless you want to lose you biggest asset. Edit Wes Matthews is questionable at best.

If youre going to punt ft Id recommend punting points as well since the player who gain the most value from a ft punt deandre jordan andre drummond whiteside gobert all shoot a very good fg and also dont score very many points. Choosing categories to punt that harmonize is a good strategy. eg boards and blocks or s and assists. In terms of your draft you should plan ahead. Do a bunch of mock drafts so you have an idea of which players are likely to be available at each of your draft spots and then narrow that list down to players who fit your specific draft strategy. Dont be afraid to reach in the draft either. Choose the players you want not the players that espn or yahoo has ranked the highest. Those rankings are usually for roto leagues anyways.

The ideal player in this league is a high volume sheet stuffing big man top  Double Double last season were mostly bigs with high s and is a double double threat triple doubles are too rare to care about.

5625041,0,t1_cwu2z7x,I dont think hes useless in Roto but you certainly have to know how to play Roto in order to gain the most out of him. Yes hes FT is going to drag you down near the bottom in FT but you dont have play him every night either. He can single handedly get you enough rebounds in half the number of games that another averagegood rebounder can do. Hes also going to be chipping in close to  STOCKS a game in those he plays. Not every team uses hackaDrummond. There are games where he only takes  FTA. I havent looked over the data but Im sure there are teams who historically employ the hackaplayer method more so than other teams. Bench Drummond in those games deploy him in games where hes got a good matchup and is less likely to be fouled and I think he can help you tremendously in Roto. Of course if youre lazy and play him for  games youre gonna be in trouble unless your team is stacked with incredible highvolume high percentage FT shooters. ,fantasybball,cwuc8q7,1,t5_2s5ct

5781800,0,t1_cxdrgxl,When he gets off of his minutes restriction yes he probably will be top  in my league as he was last year when he played full minutes and wasnt injured. My team can take the hit of having him while he isnt playing that many minutes right now because humble brag I currently have a pretty legit team as you can see in my original post when I included it. Im currently in st place right now but I do want to improve and not stay put because people may catch up. I also dont want to screw up so I dont know if I should make that trade. Not really that many great players on the WW tbh. None better than Holiday without a minutes restriction at least. But for the sake of discussion the best available centers are Plumlee JV injured Jordan Hill and Bogut. None of these produce outstanding numbers in our fantasy format.

5889066,0,t3_3vxf32,With Kidd anything is possible.Positives This is how you win a starting job in the NBA come into a position that has been unstable and a problem for your team take over and have the team start winning as you play decently. Mayo spaces the floor better than any of the other Milwaukee PGs other than perhaps Bayless. Mayo is younger than all but MCW and so could be the future from a development perspective.Negatives He has always been an SG before this so this could be a flash in the pan. Jason Kidd is involved so there is a nonzero chance Greg Monroe starts at PG at some point. There is no obvious spot in the rest of the lineup for Mayo if Parker is playing well  as MiddletonAntetokounmpoParkerMonroe seems obvious for Milwaukee long term so he could get slotted back to a  min bench role and lose all value.Its a wait and see situation or if you have a streaming spot or weak spot at the end of the roster add him. I added him at the end of last week but I have both Irving and Gobert in my  IR spots so he is potentially getting cut when one of them comes back or earlier if he loses his job.,fantasybball,cxrl9qi,11,t5_2s5ct

5906067,0,t3_3w6akx,Ive been a fan of this guy since last year. He puts up stats when he gets minutes and seems to be getting better and better!To answer your question in the short term I think he will lose minutes once Chandler comes back. He might still be serviceable but he definitely wont be dropping double doubles the way he has this past week or so and there will be some games the Suns decide to go small where his impact will be very little on the stat sheet. I picked him up and plan on riding it out the first few games Tyson is back but I wont be surprised if he falls off.Having said that I think part of the reason the Suns brought Tyson in was to mentor Alex Len. They see his potential and want to develop him. I have no doubt that his minutes will trend up as the season goes on. Particularly if Tyson keeps playing poorly and if the Suns fall out off playoff contention post all star break Definitely a player to keep an eye on all year regardless of his immediate production when Chandler come back.,fantasybball,cxtthiw,2,t5_2s5ct

Its on a matter of time before Len takes the starting position after the new year and starts playing around the  mins mark.Jon Leuer is also starting but if Markieff gets traded chances are the player thats coming to PHX is a PF and a starting one to boot.

Its smart to do that since youll have some TuesdaysThursdays that you REALLY need to fill in a couple games played and can then tailor who you add based on what categories you need if you play in a cat league.I streamed my way to a championship last year because I had a super topheavy team and a few streamer spots and it definitely worked.

6021048,0,t3_3xv38i,I picked him up an hour before I received the Rotoworld notification that he would be cleared for backtoback sets and  mpg. He had a bad game last night against the Raps but most people say he is still finding his rhythm and I agree with that. I think he will be very good this season. Im keeping him on my bench for the the rest of the month for sure unless he has a couple good games in a row. If he can avg anywhere between  fantasy points in my points league hell be exactly the finishing touch I need on my team. Bazemore was just dropped and Ive been itching all night to pick him up especially since I have Millsap and he just tweaked his ankle. If Millsap misses any games I may need to drop Parsons for Bazemore. Basically to me he is a good option to wait on but strictly if you can afford it.

It is defensible to commit in the late nd round if you have an early pick in the first. e.g. if you have st pick and go Curry then ndrd DrummondWhiteside thats  pretty solid. If you have a middle or late pick committing in the nd round seems greedy. Youre probably better off getting  good versatile guys in the first  rounds then if only  or fewer of DrummondWhitesideDJ are taken by your rd pick you can go for it.Also if youre about to draft I dont know if the draft rankings are updated from the beginning of the season or not but if not Kawhi and Draymond have both increased tremendously in value and should sustain that insane value. Kawhi in the late st is a steal Dray in the nd is a steal.,fantasybball,cyaqd16,1,t5_2s5ct

The team nearly out of contention  has every right to make trade to improve the team and therefore give themselves a chance to get into playoffs.

The next problem is that Howard and Teague could both have new homes by the end of the week so not knowing where they end up is a problem. It looks like your team could use assists and steals so Id be trying to add Teague without trading Kemba moving a Markieff or Faried or Randle to land Teague or package two guys to get a better PG than Teague in that  assist range.Now if I could trade Kemba and a Faried to get a top tier PG that might work too.,fantasybball,d028pug,1,t5_2s5ct

6656100,0,t3_46rju8,Pay attention to this sub in SeptOct to get ready for the draft.Also punt. Seriously. Some people will tell you you can win without punting and thats true you can. However its much much easier to win punting. I personally like double punting two correlated stats like ftpm or ftast or TOFG etc.Learn how to draft a punt team. Its a lot more complicated than just grabbing a bunch of bad FT shooters. The guy you wanted in the first round for punt FT this year was clearly Steph because even though hes a great ft shooter he gives value in cats the punt FT is usually weak in. CP was probably number two by same logic.Dont go in planning to punt X draft your first couple picks then figure out what direction to go. You should know how to build several dif punt teams based on dif first  picks.Finally if you want to get an edge try to get your league to play with nonstandard cats e.g. add DD or play AstTO instead of TO. If you do that you can really exploit the default preseason rankings not reflecting your league.

6710740,0,t1_d0de3oa,Its not THAT much lopsided though. Its by no means a league breaking trade. What if the other guy really needed s from people like Klay and already had people like Rondo and Wall for assists making Westbrook redundant? Then it would make sense for him to move Westbrook for one of the best  point shooters in the league on top of Thad and Hood who have both been very very good. You cant just look at the value on paper and assume you know whats best for the teams involved. THAT is why you dont just veto things that look lopsided to you. Also on a stats for stats basis I feel like Thad  Hood is a significant upgrade over Rose also considering the inevitability of missed games or injury which somewhat evens out the big upgrade from Klay to Westbrook.

I probably would draft him by the nd round at the latest if you cant draft Lebron or Boogie. Those are probably my top three choicesWith Thibedeau joining Minnesota Andrew Wiggins should probably see a boost in defensive stats. Its possible that he does improve his FT shooting though.Filling out the bottom end of your roster is where youll win though. Guys like Elfrid Payton Emmanuel Mudiay Aaron Gordon Justise Winslow and Thaddeus Young will be key in bolstering your other categories.

8511510,0,t3_4wazak,sure you have a right to be angry but realize lots of the emotions we feel are a direct result of our choices.The next time you face a stressful situation the following will happen At the beginning you will feel stressed a little bit If you remembered your decision you are going to say something like no no i wont allow myself to feel stressed you wont feel that stressed Finally you will end up feeling stressed again because you will find that you dont have any other option.So if in the end you wont be able to choose your emotions after this struggle then why bother trying? You just need another option to be able to control your emotionsI am sure you noticed that you succeeded in controlling your emotions a little bit but on finding no other options you gave in to the emotion.So what you can do here is provide your subconscious mind with other options and it will pick the best option it finds upon facing the same situation. The other option could be something like a new belief like stress wont help me or i will be able to finish my task in a better way if i didnt become stressed.know that when you are under stress or when you experience an unwanted emotion you wont be able to access all of your minds resources and so you may end up taking an emotional decision instead of a rational one.,fantasybball,d65hutk,-4,t5_2s5ct
8519161,0,t1_d65d3ti,. Wow youre really low on Lowry. He did look extremely sluggish and you make a great point on his minutes per game and age. A lot of people are going to draft him based off last years amazing performance and he tremendously helped me last year but its looking more like Ill have to look to someone else this year unless Lowry falls to late nd which I doubt.. Id be stoked to draft Paul especially this year since he seems to be falling to th or thish even thish. I still see him returning Top value or so Top at worst. Great floor for sure definitely the safest late st rounder. People are super high on the other stars and Paul is going a bit under the radar. thth has been KATLeonard thth has been DavisCousinsLebronWhiteside. Some people have even been drafting Antetokounmpo or Paul George over him which is an insane drop for Paul! Paul is definitely a sneaky great pick around that spot and I really think that given the high floor and high ceiling hes definitely someone to target around the  spot. This is of course assuming that he doesnt rise the draft as the season nears which I dont see happening. . A lot of people have been pulling the trigger on Giannis in the first round even. Didnt know that his value was the same as Wall and Lillard towards the end thats insane! I hope he pans out this season theres always that risk of not panning out. He seems like that type of st rounder that could lose you the season though. They do say that your st rounder doesnt win you the season only loses it. Ill get him early nd but not late st.. OladipoMcCollumIrving do look like a fungible group. I feel like Oladipo does have a lower floor this season with him no longer being the  option on the team. He needs to develop a better  which I dont see happening if he wants to complement Westbrook better.. Ive been in that group too that finals performance is only going to get him drafted even higher. It might motivate him though maybe. I do see him having a much better season  maybe his best yet but Im not sure if its going to be enough to warrant the hypehigh draft spot.. Staying away from Klay this season too. Draymond might be the safer option between him and Klay but Draymond brings completely different things to the table. High risk and not too sure if the reward would be worth it. . Pass on Bledsoe too. The risk is not worth the second rounder. Midrd maybe but even then thats a whole player spot that could be lost. Definitely a gamblers pick. I just need to stay away from the temptation in the actual draft hahaha. ,fantasybball,d66gf5z,1,t5_2s5ct

Are you really gonna start Dunn over someone in the rest of your roster?Theres likely  outcomes from this Dunn blows up and takes over the gig Dunn reveals to the Wolves that hes not ready yet.The latter is more likely imo.

9683881,0,t3_5drf5z,I think we have beaten this topic more so than a dead horse.  He has shown signs of revival today and him closing out the game is a good sign.  I dont doubt for a minute that Malone will choose to run Faried at the  for small ball if he deems the match up to be advantageous.Even without Faried he looks like he will be locked in a straight position battle with Nurkic for minutes as both talented big man will also be played base on matchups.  We probably wont see the top  Jokic everyone hoped for as Mudiay Gallo and Chandler are eating a lot of touches on both starting and bench minutes.If he can carve out  minutes he should offer a good top  value I feel like he wont do as well as last year post ASB even on per minute base on the current lineup.  His defensive numbers should even out but offensive load should decrease.  If you are in a shallow league you can probably get better production.  An injury or trade will definitely shake things up so keep an eye on it.,fantasybball,da6qrkt,11,t5_2s5ct

10405269,0,t1_dcnh9bn,First off thank you for the help. I didnt receive any advice in yesterdays trade thread even though I helped five people. Im the owner of BarnesRoseMKG. We definitely agree with our evaluation of Rose. While hes been scoring fine he was my highest scoring PG prior to adding Bledsoe yesterday hes a terrifying player to rely upon in dynasty. MKG was a player that I over drafted   overall but when factoring in his age and his likelihood of being guaranteed minutes do to his defensive prowess hes a low upside rotational player. Hes currently my fourteenth of fifteen possible keepers.  Im hesitating to make this trade mainly due to how weak I currently am SF I only have Harrison Barnes Michael KidGilchrist James Johnson in house until Middleton is back healthy amp how unlikely Gortat is too maintain his early season scoring down the stretch this year and in future years.

10447260,0,t1_dcs9q1g,Every year until now Ive streamed constantly however many slots were available my league had to drop it from  down to week AND add an FAAB system because of meIll admit  WAS kinda too much. Im in  teams usually so theres always some value to be found on the wire. Of course I only got into streaming because Im a terrible drafter after the early round usually cuz of luck but often because I just suck at drafting. But one of the keys benefits of streaming during the season is that I am constantly auditioning talent. And Ill keep  keepers. My philosophy is that the season is fluid. After the top  guys the rest will just keep moving around in value all the time. Yeah I might miss a keep here or there but often it doesnt matter. The key is to think therell ALWAYS be SOMEBODY even if there isnt...but there WILL BE. But you learn to recognize trends. Use streaming as auditioning and youll get to the point when you only need to stream the bottom two guys. Then playoffs will come and you stream as much as you fucking can.  games of Matt Barnes and Garrett Temple can produce like  games of Paul millsap.

In roto I think a very good case can be made for Kawhi over Harden but in hh  cat which is what I play ill take Harden all day.  I think in order to be successful in hh  cat you are better off punting  or multiple categories.  Punting FG or TOs and Harden is more valuable than Kawhi. If you punt both he is miles ahead.  Kawhi is very well rounded and if you do end up punting something with him this takes something away from that value.  Plus as ive stated before the injury concern is also there for Kawhi.  The games played difference is  games already.  Its a good discussion though and I dont really think there is a terrible answer to who is better. I just prefer Harden,fantasybball,dcwy0yr,1,t5_2s5ct

Now with  guys dropping out before this year started I knew it was going to be a whole different ball game and WOW it sure is.  Almost like playing  different fantasy sports because the strategies are so different.  Me being from Europe and watching a lot of International basketball gives me a good advantage but when its a  team league all that kind of goes out the window because everyone knows who the top  int players are and theres no need to look any further.  All that being said Im going to actively recruit guys to fill out our league to  teams because I have the most fun in that kind of environment.   teams is still fun but completely different ,fantasybball,dcxpozk,3,t5_2s5ct

I felt like there was too much of a logjam of backup bigs in LA for him to rise to the top during what is essentially just one long training camp. But I think since that humiliating Dallas debacle and maybe even falling behind the Celtics in all time wins there seems to be a bit of a change of direction going on in LA towards actually trying to see if they can win some games pick situation or not. You can tell cuz Ingram hasnt played more than  mins since and Lou all of a sudden is playing more. And it does look like Zubac is a part of that push. ,fantasybball,dd6kdpz,5,t5_2s5ct

Capable passer too and actually looks for his teammates. Not Gasol or Jokic level yet obviously. In the future though he could average  assists.

I have Collison and Im tempted to get rid of him and not pick up any Sac players because either due to inconsistent performance or coaching decisions you really dont know what youre getting out of them on any given day.  Id prefer not to have a last minute rest day for somebody like Collison or Koufos or minutes and performance fluctuations by Skal and Hield during my playoff weeks.

11381291,0,t3_62f5jd,Pretty low ceiling next season IMO.Im not too familiar with the candidates myself but from what Ive heard a month ago Fultz and Ball would be in the top  Please correct me if Im wrong. The problem is the most likely top  picks are going to Boston Lakers and Suns.Boston at the rate theyre playing this season will be contenders again next season and wont be able to dedicate too many minutes to rookie development.Suns are stacked with young ones with potential on almost every position and it just feels unlikely barring lottery luck  getting them a top  pick that they give the rookie more minutes than the likes of Booker Ulis Chriss Williams etc. This is  of course  if they fail to make playoffs and go into tankmode again.Lakers are honestly the best bet assuming they go straight into tank mode again next season i.e. doesnt sign a huge FA during the offseason.
