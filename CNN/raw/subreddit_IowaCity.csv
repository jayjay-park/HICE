19337,0,t3_1ubqu7,Oh this is my thing. First for board games theres a Meetup group that does board gaming. I just went for the first time last month and it was a lot of fun.As for DND we talked about it a bit when a few of us did pub trivia a while back. uscttwoods who posted in this thread already was there too. Ive played quite a bit of DND but Ive never DMd it. Id certainly be willing to do it though if no one else is able to.Id also really like to play Shadowrun another tabletop RPG. Although if you havent played a tabletop RPG before its not a great way to get into the hobby. Its way more complicated than DND.Anyway I dont get back to Iowa City for another week and a half or so but once Im back Im down.Im not must of a video gamer. The games I do play are on PC though. Mainly Kerbal Space Program Skyrim and Fallout.,IowaCity,cegmuth,2,t5_2r945

They said yes without ever asking to even see the letter even though our lease had a No pets allowed clause.  A few months before he moved out I asked if I could get a dog since him and his dog would be leaving and they said yes.  It probably helps we always try to be really friendly with them.  My neighbors that moved in above us this year also have a dog although idk of the landlords know about that one.  Bottom line is just ask and see what they say.  If you can get a recommendation from a therapist itll help a ton too. Im not going to say who my landlord is just because I dont think they really want other people to know they allowed it for us.Edit bonus picture ,IowaCity,d02txab,4,t5_2r945

Mind you the city of CR sets the rates for their companies across the board no flat rates.
