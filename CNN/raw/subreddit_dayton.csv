Most reputable HVAC companies will sell brands with good recognition like Trane pretty sure thats what home depot and lowes sells too.

1209629,0,t3_27yq6o,My recommendation  East Dayton is where you want to be. Its cheap and not as bad as the west side.Interesting thing about Dayton  Downtown has about a total of  jobs mostly professionals. Between McCook Field and Old North Dayton are about  jobs that are mostly manufacturing and hospital. I would probably suggest looking for housing in that area. Its mostly lower income but I dont hear too many problems on that side of town. Plus Citywide is working on revamping that area of town because they recognize that it is the nd most popular area for employment. Outlined in the map is Old North Dayton and to the left until the river is McCooks Field. Along Dixie Rd you will be able to find a motel that accepts cash  dont be shocked if you see drug dealers or prostitutes though. I think you can find trouble anywhere if you look for it but you should be relatively safe. Also if you run into the possibilities of being homeless please know there is a ton of resources in our area for you. If you get to St. Vincents early enough you can secure a bed for the night. Secure a social worker to get you into housing. Target Dayton usually offers meals to people who need them. I have known many homeless people and still do know a few if you have any questions in the future pm me. I would be happy to help you as much as I can!,dayton,ci5p9jh,4,t5_2rlxw

2019973,0,t3_2hw5x0,Does anyone else inat the wedding want to get their hair or makeup done?  If so  did my sisters wedding in May and I thought they were really good.  They are a little pricer and have a minimum number of people they are willing to do but maybe they would be more flexible for a Thursday wedding.  The airbrush might sound like its going to be over the top but it actually looks very natural compared to a lot of makeup and it lasts way better than anything else.  The girls were all good about doing the right amount of makeup on everyone according to what we said we wanted so I wouldnt worry about being overdone.  If that doesnt work you could look at some of the stylists at Salon Lofts at Town and Country and see if someone there could do your hair and makeup since its close to your venue.  ,dayton,ckwlq2v,2,t5_2rlxw

3149066,0,t3_2w05kx,Canal Public House has coop night on Tuesdays and it is effectively their open mic. Once had a two or three week wait to get on the list though Im not sure it is that way anymore.South Park Taverns open mic is on Wednesday and signups are on their website. Spots are generally filled up a week in advance and there is often a decent sized listening audience though not always. Ive played Trolly Stops and Blind Bobs open mics on Thursdays but wouldnt recommend those unless you simply want a stage to stand on with a mic as it has been my experience that no one is generally listening. Show up that night to sign up for those two. There are others of course and most are advertised in the free Dayton City Paper that rolls out every Tuesday all around town. Im partial to SPTs open mic and met my current bandmates there. We still play as a three piece now almost every Wednesday. Theres a showcase there Friday Feb  highlighting some of the artists who cut their teeth at open mic and now play regular gigs.Also check out Todd the Fox on FB. I believe hes started back up his weekly Your Song Here show that is essentially an open mic but with the option of having him and a drummer and bass player back you up.

In  the population was estimated at  a decrease of  or ..In  Dayton FD responded to more than  drug overdoses and theyre working harder than ever to try and keep up with this growing trend.According to this recent ABC postTypically the coroners office will see a slowdown in the month of January but not this year. Examiners performed  autopsies last month  of them were overdoses. If you extrapolate the numbers that would mean  overdose deaths this year if those numbers hold steady.If you consider  overdose deaths in the county a year extrapolated over a  year period youre looking at around  deaths on the high end at the current rate.This is enough to actually cause a population loss in the county solely due of deaths from overdose. This is the kind of population decrease you will see in an epidemic. Furthermore this doesnt even count decreases in county population from natural migrations to other parts of the statecountry.According to the CDC in  which is old information and likely low there were . drug overdose deaths per  in Ohio. This is higher than any standard death rate for any disease. TLDR The overdose rate in Montgomery County is so insanely high its enough to cause a population decrease in the area because of high mortality.
