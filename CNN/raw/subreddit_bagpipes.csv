781398,0,t1_cgs2i5d,Interestingly I can set the bridles on my tenors so that the drones off with the air pressure created by the weight of the pipes.  Moving approximately one micron from there and I cant MAKE them cut out for any amount of money.  I guess I need to adjust in quartermicron steps...,bagpipes,cgt3kbk,1,t5_2s9vv

More experienced pipers will have more insightful responses but it sounds like a jig or something which there are plenty of them out there to look up how they are written.

1762431,0,t1_ck16epa,One could argue that during SFUs golden years Ill call it that now but they could be back at the top next year or they could continue to fall they had the best band in the world piperforpiper against any other band. This definitely isnt the case now which means that they arent going to have the same infallible consistency that FMM currently has. Its also a personal opinion that SFU tunes their chanters a bit too sharp or what I call happy while others like FMM SLOT and Power take a deeper darker tone. Judges were all over SFUs tone for a while but have recently in the last ish years taken a preference to that deeper and darker tone.Another thing to note is that SFU won the drumming two years in a row  and  with Pearl drums and then switched to Andante  the resonance you get off the Andantes isnt the same as the Pearls or Premiers for that matter and their drumming mark hasnt been the same since.Im not sure this even answered your question but there are some points to think about!,bagpipes,ck1b7k3,2,t5_2s9vv

3324789,0,t1_cp40z51,The pipes havent been played in around  years or so having spoken to people in person Ive been advised to oil them thoroughly. I am aware that sometimes things will go wrong for no apparent reason. Unfortunately thats the nature of bagpipes in general. The pipes may need stuck on a lathe at some point to remove some of the tougher dirt and stains. Ive also dropped the silver idea . Not bothered about resale value but I agree it wouldnt look right. ,bagpipes,cp7955c,1,t5_2s9vv

Page  here and lines  to  hereIn both cases you want to begin slowly so you can make sure youre moving immediately from one note to the next and not accidentally hitting an intermediate note. In the second case with the doublings listen closely to your doublings to make sure that youre moving from one note to the next while your highG finger is in the air to start the doubling  this can be really tricky as youre learning.Let me know if any of my descriptions didnt make sense.,bagpipes,cs8qyno,1,t5_2s9vv

9175598,0,t3_55zbfu,Try stretching before you play.  Gently pull back on your wrist  fingers at a time.  Grip your index and middle finger while relaxing your ring and pinkie.  Pull back until you can feel the muscles in your lower arm stretch.  Switch to the other  fingers and repeat.  Doing it  fingers at a time as opposed to  fingers puts less strain on your wrist as you stretch.  Repeat in the down direction and for the other hand.,bagpipes,d8f2owb,3,t5_2s9vv

9665840,0,t3_5dfviu,Sounds like youve got a couple recommendations... as for your final question I dont think its unfair to use a metronome in competition but Id highly suggest you dont.Think about it like this your nerves are high on the day of the competition you start to pump the tempo up a bit and suddenly youre slightly off from what the metronome is buzzing and you cant get back on the beat. If you do manage to slow down now it looks like you cant keep a tempo. Better to practice with a metronome on the practice chanter and let the tempo fall where it will on the pipes.I can also compare it to the should you be allowed to use music in competition argument I dont think music should be against the rules but I can almost guarantee you that someone who has played the music enough to have it memorized will play better than someone looking off music. A metronome will make your playing sound artificial or robotic  musicality is key.,bagpipes,da4imtb,4,t5_2s9vv

11085560,0,t3_5y5bj2,If youre serious about learning you could just get the Scots Guards settings.

11101098,0,t1_deq7fxz,So Im in a similar situation.   wingspan of  and skinny as hell.I use the Willie McCallum Custom bag which is a little bit thinner and longer than a medium.  Link to Bannatynes size chartIt works pretty well for me but it took me a little bit to get used to how the drones are placed on the thinner bag  my bass drone was resting right up against my ear.  Slight change in bag positioning took care of it but every now and then itll slip back if I dont play for awhile.,bagpipes,deqasvi,2,t5_2s9vv
11406915,0,t3_62sm7u,Tough to diagnose over the internet.  Try blowing the drones up and gradually increasing the pressure until they shut off.  They should all cut off at about the same pressure.  If not then you may need to adjust a bridle.Look closely at the reed thats hissing.  See if  you can see anything that would prevent the reed blade from sealing against the body of the reed.  Also they can get dirty.  Slide a piece if paper under the blade then squeeze the blade to the body and pull the paper out.  Doing this a few times will clean out any crud that has accumulated between the blade and the body.  I keep a couple of nice clean US dollar bills in my pipe case for this purpose.  Also helpful if you find yourself a bit short at the beer tent. ,bagpipes,dfoykg9,4,t5_2s9vv
