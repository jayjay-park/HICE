278322,0,t3_1xan80,Were looking at  weeks regular season each team plays each other  week and then a tournament. I think NLTP is definitely viable. Were you aware of NLTP when you came up with your idea for SLTP?My biggest concern about SLTP is that teams that come in late will not be as organized or well directed which still leaves them out. NLTP has captains that monitor the free agency as well as plan and coordinate for their team.   I think staggering the start dates of  leagues the NLTP and the MLTPmLTP system gives people a greater opportunity to get in without waiting to long but still be under direction of an appointed an competent captain.Is SLTP for sure a thing? I think the way that we are set up is working and this may be excessive.,NLTP,cf9lzrv,3,t5_2zywm

Let me give you a quick rundown.LTP is open to all players any  people can come together and form a team. This team does not have any association with MLTP teams although midseason pickups are possible. Each team then plays a random team each week and standings are determined with TrueSkill. TrueSkill allows teams to join in at any time and still provide a reasonable ranking. For more information see here.,NLTP,cfnr91l,5,t5_2zywm

2217040,0,t3_2kiiy2,I imagine a system similar to baseball where we have multiple teams of  players all within a franchise ranging from majors to novice. Weekly callups would fill any weektoweek needs and this way everyone gets playing time. With only  players per position it would be much easier to rotate everyone in while maintaining competitiveness. Some potential issues are that players may not like their captains and vice versa. For this reason we need to implement a system where trades are encouraged. I have no thoughts on this but feel it is important.Also some people will worry about finding enough captains. I dont believe this will be an issue. The captain of the MLTP team would draft hisher majors and AAA team. Then ask the players of the AAA team who would like to be a captain. Most teams I have been on have had  people who would be willing to assume a captains role if given the chance anecdotal I know. The MLTP captain and AAA captain can together draft a AA team findappoint an AA captain who then assists in drafting A and on down to novice or however many steps are needed to fill players. As it stands right now if given the choice between minors and Novice I am not sure what I would do. But if given the chance to move up within my same team to a new level where I was guaranteed  minutes a week I would take it without a doubt. Now I understand this is very radical and may require time to change and is highly unlikely to happen next season in Mmltp. However we can do this here in NLTP next season. With  players coming down from mLTP due to downsizing it is inevitable that the level that Ateams play at will increase. If we want to remain developmental there has to be more layers to teams. Os started with about  players showing up regularly and now are down to  due to playtime limitations. I am confident we would have retained more people if there was more play time to go around. If we start with a tiered NLTP next season we accommodate the mLTP players dropping down remain developmental and give everyone more playtime. With  captains each in charge of  players nobody would go unnoticed or feel neglected. And most importantly if NLTP can give proof of concept to MmLTP they may adopt it and we can solve the problems surrounding minor league.,NLTP,clln0fv,9,t5_2zywm

3147398,0,t1_conocbc,Spin is determined by physics. The exact same physics every time. Your spin is going to be exactly as it is mathematically determined whether you can see it or not. There arent any outside variables other than the angle and speed at which you hit an obstacle. Its an inherent feature of the game. Basketball players know how to use spin on their ball to make a layup even though they dont see any spin until the ball is out of their hands because they know what angle and speed they should use based on their positioning on the backboard. Other players movements are not guaranteed. You can try to predict them but a player can improvise and do something you dont expect because they have their own mind.

Maybe if MLTP wants to punish LUKEMOO then I can understand that.  To me his efforts and work put him above the law in terms of this situation.The you must be clean in all situations to play in NLTP is a decent idea.

RizzyB for example was drafted when Pop Culture thought they already had their MVBDBOY in their  pick tsu.

My ping to Centra tends to only be about  worse than to OriginSphere whereas all of them tend to be  worse than Radius.Not complaining or anything just mentioning it since you brought it up. I wonder which people would prefer given the option. Our reward for winning home field was playing on a server  miles away from our home server. And HGWs home server was  miles away from theirs.

5314212,0,t3_3nqznu,Im late to the party but I guess I should briefly give my opinions as well.  Im not against having RC members elected through some other means captains or public or some sort of split.  There are some definite cons that could come from a system electing people internally yearafteryear.  Id like to make a few points though. The current and former RCCommishes werent elected because they agreed with all of PKs ideas and were in no way PKs minions.  If anything Id say PK had the most differing opinions from the rest of us.. Just because a vote is left to a larger group doesnt mean there wont be tons of voting done out of pure selfinterest.  If it becomes a public vote it could just become a popularity contest like all of the endofseason awards we always complain about.  Leaving it up to the captains isnt an optimal solution either just to give one example a few seasons ago when we gave them a say in who to elect as the next RC member one captain who was also a candidate voted only for himself to be elected when he could have chosen up to three candidates.  It was a clear example of not taking the vote seriously and also not having the leagues best interest in mind when voting on who will run the league.. If we do go to elections I dont think it should be oneseason terms like MLTP has unless they wish.  Bringing in  or  new members every season isnt good for leadership consistency and could eventually result in some bad apples being elected.. Really though Im almost positive PK puts more time into this than any of us do which really shouldnt be happening because he needs be out having fun being a college freshman.,NLTP,cvqyblz,2,t5_2zywm

6026091,0,t1_cy9j21t,gtHell probably be lower tier A unless he becomes way more dedicated. I could say this about tons of older players. New and younger players are coming in and are being incredibly active. Theyre on mumble every night scrimming every night playing SOCL every night. And because theyre so involved and play so much more they get better way more quickly than the older players who are just maintaining their skill level. I look at people like NotEvenMex H.D. Acapuck as people who came into the game and really dedicated their time to it and now are very mechanically sound and now just need the coaching to fix decision making. But the best way to improve that too is to play A LOT. Youre an adult and your life doesnt revolve around tagpro I get it but some kids out there they have nothing better to do but get insanely good at this game and that is crazily hard to match. So no I dont think youre going to be able to match their levels of activity or dedication. This isnt a comment on your skill or personality its an observation about how your life has taken you and how it lets you be involved. I had the same concern about Pocketweed he had a crazy schedule a few seasons ago that severely hindered his ability to be around. Its way easier for me to feel okay with drafting a kid who has nothing better to do than to sit on the computer for six hours each night. I didnt say you werent dedicated or that you werent dedicated enough but based on what Ive seen of you playing I think you project at the lower end of A team. Which I could be wildly wrong about but from what I think unless you are able to do what these kids do youre not suddenly going to get way better. A switch doesnt just flip one day and youre great at TagPro. Its all practice. Last season my team which made the finals I dont think we even had some of the most skilled people. We had talent Eashy inter and experience Kami Heisy and by combining the ability to scrim every night with that mixture we got a top tier team. Its so incredibly rare that a team can just show up on game day and dominate. You saw it a little bit with Ghostboosters last season but the supporting pieces Fronj Jake Protag were on every night scrimming and that is what made all the difference. None of them are particularly blessed at the game but they are way too fucking active and have thus gotten pretty good. So yeah to summarize TagPro is a game of sacrificing your social life to get good at popping balls. Some people can make that sacrifice and some people cant. From what youve explained in your post and what Ive seen in the past you cant dedicate yourself like  year olds in high school which is fine but I also dont think you can claim your super dedicated. Which as sidenote dedicated is  a super fucking subjective word. My definition is clearly different from yours but then again Im able to get online everyday and juggle a number of different things because it is a hobby Ive made time for.  ,NLTP,cy9jiqo,12,t5_2zywm

Not very hard to do the math there  nobody is going to lose playing time.Honestly Im sad that NLTP split into two leagues and even sadder that people want to keep it that way. NLTP Season  was one of the funnest things ever. Having  teams just didnt feel right.People who are sad because they had fun in ALTP youre going to have just as much fun in NLTP. Trust me. Youre not gonna get your head stomped in by a bunch of bigbadballs. Youll be playing with almost all of the same people you played with last season  the same teammates the same opponents.And you wont have to worry about your team fucking disbanding or whatever. Fuck that. Once I saw that happen I hoped that ALTP would die. Teams disbanding is a massive failure of the system not the leaders ily chelsea and it should be proof enough that our inability to predict the size of our player base necessitates a league that is large enough to absorb that kind of attrition.,NLTP,d2kgpjb,10,t5_2zywm
