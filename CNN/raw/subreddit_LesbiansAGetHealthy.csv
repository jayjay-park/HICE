8481474,0,t3_4vl447,Hi yall.  Im in EST my goal is to up my distance back to  miles every other day as I rehab from a stress fracture. For now Im just working on running for about an hour regardless of distance and trying to listen to what my body is telling me without just hearing my lungs yell stop! This sucks and its hot!  My lungs are wimps. I have an accountability partner IRL in my BFF but Im always down for some solid hoorahs. In addition to running I am limiting sugar to twice a week. This is hard as I have kids and it is summer and damnit Popsicles are delicious. ,LesbiansAGetHealthy,d61q86a,1,t5_3fo33

9427529,0,t1_d9auoim,Running slays me lmao! Like I worry for myself in case of a zombie apocalypse or something and folks were running to save their lives Id be in a heap of trouble. But Im planning on changing that. I shall conquer it someday or die trying at least.Benching  is pretty cool goal and very achievable. Just gotta work up there incrementally. Hope you dont think that way anymore. Life is about perspectives! Lets do this! ,LesbiansAGetHealthy,d9b05uw,1,t5_3fo33

10275766,0,t1_dc0iyi7,Just FYI  You still earn points when you fess up to having a bad nutritional day. Accountability is sometimes just as important as meeting your goals IMO. ,LesbiansAGetHealthy,dc8tatg,1,t5_3fo33

10408059,0,t3_5olusi,I did an amazing  minute chest shoulder and tri workout today. I used kinda fluffy weights lbs but Im just learning the moves so I would rather be safe. Nutrition wise I stayed in my numbers but I did make a ziti pasta bake because I kept seeing pictures people were posting elsewhere.  I made a single serving size with brown rice pasta and a sprinkle of cheese. I didnt even finish the whole thing so that felt good. All in all successful day. ,LesbiansAGetHealthy,dcntkst,1,t5_3fo33
