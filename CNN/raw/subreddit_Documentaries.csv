468725,0,t1_cft5ges,Interesting. I see it is different in Europe. I havent heard any talk about a quota system here in the US. The mainstream feminist movement here has focused on making higher positions more friendly to women through things like reproductive rights combating sexism and harassment in the workplace and changing media messages. Theyve also worked to make scholarships and support groups available for women who pursue STEM fields and have launched visibility campaigns so girls can see successful women role models.And I think weve seen a large improvement in the media since this documentary was made because of things like The Hunger Games more complex female television characters and even this new ad for GE. True I think both sexes are negatively affected by beauty standards and the obsession with youth but I think the point here is that society needs to give women the chance to be judged by other criteria as well. If a woman isnt allowed to prove herself brilliant in politics science or business or those traits arent valued in a woman all thats left is her youth and appearance. I think the media reflects this. I feel that if a man isnt young or maybe isnt goodlooking the media shows he can still be attractive if hes extraordinary in other ways. We see this in James Bond movies where Bond is usually much older than the women he seduces and in romantic comedies where the overweight or unattractive guy gets the beautiful woman anyway by being a good person or with powerful politicians or businessmen marrying their second or third wife who is half their age. I dont often see this being portrayed in the in the reverse. Usually the ugly woman becomes physically beautiful somehow first then gets the guy I can only name Hairspray as one exception off the top of my head. And you rarely see older women dating or marrying men much younger than them. But yes I think men and boys are harmed by other toxic ideas of what it is to be a man in society. Men are subjected to some tough standards and ideas of manhood that dont let them be themselves or make them feel like failures. Right or wrong the mainstream feminist movement in the US has approached this with the reasoning that If we make feminine qualities equal to and not inferior to masculine qualities men wont feel that anything outside the definition of a man is bad and will be more comfortable expressing themselves or looking up to women I think in that way men should be advocating for themselves too. Id like to see a movement where men fight for their right to cry in public express their feelings bake sew be a dancer be a house husband or even be a virgin without being ridiculed.

603942,0,t1_cg8v758,Well just to take the gun murders as an example there are a ridiculously larger proportion of them in the US than in other developed and even most developing countries.  So its not one to one moderates to extremists like youre suggesting.  Of course there are heaps of awesome sensible Americans but unfortunately on the whole Americas obsession with guns wars and prisons is pretty extreme when compared with other countries in the developed world. Edit and I totally understand the argument that everyone shouldnt be thrown into one bucket like that.  Most people dont choose to be American or French or Mongolian.  But the fact is that a persons nationality is quite a large defining factor of who they are.  Personally I dont agree with this but unfortunately its a fact of life.  I think its totally wrong to discriminate against people based on nationality so for example if I run a restaurant i should have no right to refuse Russians to my restaurant.   But to categorize people based on nationality is common and natural.  This is essentially what things like census data do.  This is what GDP and GNP do.  If there were no differences between America and Mexico there would be no need for a border.  And again personally I think humans went wrong a long time ago with establishing these norms but thats another rant ,Documentaries,cg8x6x4,5,t5_2qhlh

1029244,0,t1_chl7z83,Good comment but people should still be free to do what they consider best for them even if it seems undesireable to the majority  or the west in this case. I think that is also an absolute core and key value of the USAmerican society  even if it gets lost here and there.What bothers me profoundly about this doc and the comments reflecting it here is the underlaying attitude of blaming afghans for not playing along with the orchestra of western interests. Theyve been living in a warzone for the last forty years and we have nothing better to do but to blame them after we dropped our bombs on them too. I dont doubt that the scenes in this film show a part of reality but it is only a part of it. Yet it is a welcomed opportunity to deny all responsibility and settle the case by claiming that it is impossible to educate barbarians. How cynical is that...There was a relatively calm period between  and  when the west should have spend billions on reconstruction instead of ongoing military operations or on top of that and thereby giving these people a perspective. Something even the sovjets did better when they tried to build up some industry there. Even Germany wouldnt have recovered the way it did after WW without MASSIVE funding from the US. And again Afghanistan was looking at  years of constant conflict when the west put his foot there. Figure out yourself what funding would have been needed to rebuild something that remotely resembles a modern state.And then again maybe they want to live like that  with their traditions with that hardship of life in the mountains the simplicity it has to it. Who the hell are we to judge. Those people never did anything to us nothing. If UBL and a few Taliban are reason enough for us to bomb the shit out of them then I sure hope never to be hold accountable to the same standard.The West messed up big time in Afghanistan  partly because the situation was terribly misjudged by us not the afghans.

If none of these points are mentioned in the doco then the doco is not worth the time to watch or even criticise  just ignore the pile of crap! Here is the list   Does the doco make it clear that the Western Christians have been living in fear for over  years from constant fear of the Islamic jihad that has already conquered most Christian lands to the East? Does it talk about the Sack of Rome in AD ? An IslamicArab army attacked Rome and sacked St Peters Basiclica and St Pauls Outside the Walls two of the most holiest churches for all Christians a few months after Charlesmagne was crowned at the basilica. Is there any mention of the Dhimmi laws Christians lived under when ruled by the Muslims? Closer to the time period of the Crusades is there any detailed discussion on the Church of the Holy Sepluchre the MOST HOLIEST CHURCH for all Christians being destroyed by the order of the Islamic Caliph and what anger this caused throughout Christian Europe? This is the equivalent of Israel throwing a bomb into Mecca and not expecting the Muslims to respond with abject violence toward everyone! Is there any mention of the Battle of Manzikert on August  ? It was the loss at this battle that finally got the Byzantine Emperor to go and seek help from the Pope! Is there any mention of the fact that the Christians of Europe were right to be very afraid of the Turks a new batch of converts to Islam who unlike the Arabs at the time at least were a lot more intolerant of Christian pilgrims? Is there any mention of the dangers faced by Christian pilgrims to go and see their own holy sites in Jerusalem and Bethlehem? Is there any mention of the rules of war in the middle ages? Essentially any city that did not surrender after a certain time period that city could be besieged and its citizens slaughtered. This was done by Muslims and Christians. The Crusaders ransacked Jerusalem because most of the Christian population had been expelled by the Muslims  they were afraid the Christians would go rogue and betray them! So when the Crusaders went on their rampage they went knowing they didnt have to fear if they were killing their fellow Christians. Cities that did surrender would not see a mass slaughter! Does the doco continue with the myth that it was second and third sons that joined the Crusades because they knew there was no hope for them to gain any land in Europe? This is not true and has been refuted repeatedly. In fact the idea that Crusaders went on the crusade to claim land itself is a myth that has been refuted over and over again by serious historians of the Middle Ages. Does the doco make it clear that it was Islamic jihad that inspired the concept of a Crusade for Western Chrisitans and that this is something that Holy War was indeed new to Christianity as a concept? Does it mention all the times it was rejected by the Eastern Christians? Does the doco make it clear that most of our understanding of the Crusades today comes not from historical research but by an antiCatholic screed called The Talisman written by Sir Walter Scott. This is like someone claiming to make the most accurate doco on Christianity after being inspired by the Da Vinci Code!There are many more points but if this doco or any other on the Crusades makes no mention of any of these points or just hints at them then that doco is a pile of crap and should be ignored. You cannot claim that you are making a doco that looks at both sides of the conflict if those points above are not clearly mentioned in your documentary!Make a doco mentioning all those points and I will promote the crap out of it!So those who have watched the BBC doco  does it mention any of my points?,Documentaries,chr7tal,1,t5_2qhlh

I dont want to spoil anything but you will be shocked at some of the executives theyve had over the years and be surprised at some of the familiar faces who worked there before they became famous.    I also liked Chuck Jones Extremes and InBetweens.  This one is about Jones incredible contributions to animation.  Another behindthescenes look but this time at the Warner Brothers animation studio.  Lots of good clips of classic old WB cartoons including works like The Grinch.   Another good one is Frank and Ollie about two of the Nine Old Men the original core animators at Disney.  Its as much about these two old guys who still live next door to each other and are best friends after decades as it is about animation but you wont mins that at all.   Walt and El Grupo is another that reminisces about when Disney took a crew to South America.  Some people want more about the politics surrounding the trip but if youre looking for information about animation you wont mind that omission.  You will get to see how the animators made sketches of the area its people plants and animals to use as references.  Weve seen that before its pretty common to see these days but its still interesting to see them doing that in .

1366153,0,t1_cini8wh,Im not so much looking for motivation to get rid of my money thats never been much of an issue but trying to use myself as an example of how changing the service model for movies might improve both customer satisfaction and financial returns. What both Steam and Spotify have done is made it possible to offer just about everything in their respective markets and theyve made it easy to pay. With TV and movies its much more fragmented some of it is on Hulu some on Netflix some of it isnt being offered at all because its too recent some of it is exclusive to HBO and everywhere theres restrictions on where it can and cannot be watched depending on which country youre located in.

1368548,0,t1_cinrhf0,Okay but I still have an issue with your timeline  by  iTunes Store was up and running and available on Windows and Mac and there were other persong options as well.  And yeah of course prices came down because of piracy but so what?  This is getoffmylawn territory for sure but Im OLD born in  and started buying albums in the s and spent  or  for an easily scratched  minute record that would physically wear out at some point even if you took perfect care of it.  The cost of those albums in todays money is close to  and around  ten years ago.  And yeah there were all kinds of albums I bought based on a recommendation or a magazine article without even listening to them and some instant regrets.  You couldnt buy individual tracks for the most part unless they were released as singles and pretty current  and there were a LOT of tracks that were simply never released as singles  but even if you found one they would be  to  in todays prices.So do I understand why piracy blew up around the turn of the century?  Sure  there was a period of several years when it was fairly simple to download music and the record industry lagged behind in exploiting the internet to distribute music.  But cost hasnt been a justification for piracy if it ever was for well over ten years now.  ,Documentaries,cinu3z0,1,t5_2qhlh

1374656,0,t1_cioep1g,As an ancient historian quite literally every documentary I have seen on TV and on Youtube about Mesopotamia is filled with insane conspiracy theories and wild speculation by people with no academic background. Unfortunately real history is generally not that entertaining to most people and many of the things that were accepted as fact fifty years ago have been debunked by nowthink about how many things you learned in high school American history that were complete myth and then amplify that problem a hundred times over. Even middle and high school world history textbooks are generally filled with factual errors. To make things much worse credible ancient historians are generally resistant to technology or contributing to publicly available resources because its incredibly frustrating to argue with ancient alien conspiracy theorists who are louder and tend to sell many more books than we do.

1386138,1,t1_ciq0wd9,gtThey are reducing the purchasing power of CASH you hold. Any other asset stocks bonds housing would either be implicitly or explicitly pegged to inflation.Let me translate it to normal English. Those who have real assets paid off will see them appreciate in value. Those who have none or are trying to acquire them through loans backed by income will suffer because  especially housing which constitutes  of expenditures on average  is very susceptible to inflationary impulses while wages remain relatively inflexible in comparison. So... the rich get richer and poor get poorer.  If you forgive the hyperbolic bullshit. Would you like me to try some curves and graphs?gtHow much  of your net wealth is cash equivalent? For the vast majority its impact is relatively small. No one has k in their chequing accounts.No the majority have assets which are acquired by loans which are guaranteed by cash earnings. The structure of how assets and liabilities are identified qualifies a house worth currently k for which you have a mortgage with k left to pay off typically as a k asset when in reality its just k. Also when you take a loan with a small downpayment you borrow an amount larger than the current value of the house as a result your net wealth is negative until those numbers balance out.And there are those who have no assets.gtNot to mention this is also a reduction of debt obligations and benefits borrowers which is better for inducing economic growth.You are one of those people who memorized the textbook without paying attention arent you? First of all it only benefits borrowers if the lenders are not the ones creating the new money. And if the lenders cant adjust for depreciation with interest. Then it becomes meaningless.  And I dont even want to address inducing economic growth through borrowing because that would be an essay that you would not understand or even want to. If you still believe this nonsense my explanations are pointless.gtThe ones who get it at old currency value are also the ones lending it out. Which means they they are the ones most screwed over by the reduced purchasing power in future when they get it back.Are you not forgetting interest?  You are lending  at  expecting a discount of  which should give you a  net gain. Besides you are forgetting the fundamental difference  the creators of money do not bear the cost of the new money. They create it out of thin air through an accounting trick  and their only real gain is precisely interest because the money...well it technically doesnt exist physically. Its all an accounting trick.Sigh...This is what talking with amateurs feels like .,Documentaries,ciq1984,10,t5_2qhlh

1427855,0,t1_civ8ebk,Its because people never investigate economic systems after elementary school. Theyre told capitalism means free choice to sell your labor who would choose this? or start a business profits? or be happy. Theyre told communism means you have to share everything you own and nobody works because there is no motivation ??. Anarchism means anyone can steal your stuff if theyre stronger than you because the only thing that separates us from beasts is the government ??. When youre young and impressionable you dont ask the important questions and you internalize the attitudes. Even people who go to college to study economics political science etc. find themselves operating within a very limited neoliberal framework.To be honest I would say that the American regime is far more at fault. Even the lowermiddle class lives far better than even the upper class in the third world because of the predatory system of finance capital and less commonly now direct exploitation. If you have a house in America then you have hot running water. In the majority of the world even upperclass households have water tanks with a limited supply of tepid water.

Before these radicalizing forces were acting the support was limited purely to reasonable demands supported by peaceful protest.Even then to say all Sikhs supported it is an exaggeration. Many Sikhs argued passionately against communal tensions and many Sikhs were part of the armed forces many engaged in violent and nonviolent protests though. The numbers are significant they include the large Peasants Union and other organisations that put class interests over religious ones.

Not at the risk of losing friends family and employment because of it. They are out there though. Friends family coworkers. Most folks dont get much choice as to where their sexual proclivities lie which is a shame. Be nice to get a survey before you are born asking what you would like to put your dick into when you grow up.So long as the zoophile goes into well armed with information there is very little risk to the animal and provided the zoo doesnt rush into things very little risk for him or her either.Of course some situations arise that injure the animal mentally or physically but well humans are far more vicious to each other in that respect than to animals.

1821834,0,t1_ck8eo3g,I have no idea where my family was a couple of generations ago because my dad never knew his mom or his dad and neither did my mom.  So for all intents and purposes I was raised with the same set of disadvantages as the average black man my age.  My family was poor and came from a background where graduating high school was considered a huge life success and college was never even considered.  I have black friends who come from poor backgrounds in fact before I moved away from my hometown at age  almost all of my friends were poor and black but most not quite as poor as me.The difference between me and them is that when I finally grew up enough to realize that the world doesnt revolve around me and that while its true I can behave however I want and I can demand to be treated as equally or unequally as my heart desires nobody is required to honor those demands and if I LOOK undeserving of being treated like an equal member of society a lot of people arent going to treat me like one.  Fair?  Maybe not.  But either play the game to win or dont and lose by default.Just stop mouthing off to cops stop acting like black culture consists of nothing more than speaking like youre illiterate and dressing like a gang member and then acting all insulted when youre treated like one stop blaming everything on racism and maybe some day we can live like they do in England where folks who are black are just folks who happen to also be black.,Documentaries,ck8pvr4,2,t5_2qhlh

1859552,0,t1_ckck0oc,maybe not public  I wouldnt want my children unnecessarily confronted by the sex trade. If there where controls like there is on the sale of tobacco on it I think that would be better. You could put your Paradise sign up on your brothel but girls in bikinis hanging out of windows objectifies the sex workers and shouldnt be allowed. I think as a punter you should feel awed by the sex workers and it should be an honour to spend time with one. I also think that the best way to control the workplace is to have a Prostitution licence for every girl which would act like a driving licence. youd have to have regular monthly doctors appointments and screenings etc to ensure that the sex workers were not getting abused or endangering themselves. It would hopefully tackle the trafficking of humans too.,Documentaries,ckd9rb2,0,t5_2qhlh

Besides those religious people who devote their lives to helping the disenfranchised dont do it because God tells them to they do it because to them its the right thing to do. Morality and religion are not the same thing nor does morality come from religion. A persons moral compass is how they filter the information from the religion in order to have it conform to their way of thinking. If people who found god or lived according to the books did do accurately our world would be even scarier than It is today.

2191493,0,t1_clibxr5,Two concerns I have with the victims wouldnt like it argument.  First practically speaking its a smokescreen used by politicians to encourage the passage of legislation and  law and order candidates in election years and unrelated to the efficacy of either a law or prison treatment plan.  The US prison system is a remarkable engine of failure that nevertheless manages to sustain social and political support using tactics like this.Second its unrelated entirely from the authority and purpose of law.  When you harm a person you may well suffer consequences directly from that person or in your example their surviving family.  This is vigilante justice and often it is itself illegal.  Law and judicial punishment on the other hand are socially constructed a criminal doesnt hurt individuals so much as offend the society which protects them poorly in this case.  In your example the crime is sufficiently heinous to merit in some American states the ultimate social punishment namely permanent removal from society.  But where the legal process dictates a sentence less than death the owner becomes a ward of the state eventually to be returned to society.  It does society no good then to lose sight of this eventual outcome and needlessly enhance a wards punishment on the off chance that it returns a sadistic pleasure to the victim or hisher family.  The more likely result is that it will again needlessly decrease the chances of a successful reintegration into society.,Documentaries,clie4o1,1,t5_2qhlh

One I wouldnt even condemn hence my link to the fallacy being in use.The reasonablemoderate Christian should be aware of hisher potential when it comes to affecting other reasonable individuals in that group of lets say cult members surrounding some influential leaders.

2416572,0,t1_cma4r5l,Thats a good question and one that not all orthodox Christians agree on I can offer you two views that may help bearing in mind that I am not a theologian. God is just therefore he cannot let evil go unpunished. We did evil and the fair punishment was death both spiritual and physical but God is also loving and did not wish to destroy us all therefore he punished Jesus so that his justice was satisfied and we could be forgiven. This view is called penal substitutionary atonement and it is popular with evangelicals and many other Protestants but it has some problems since in that view God is kind of fighting himself for what to do with us. Also it isnt clear to me how its any more fair for us to get let off the hook now that Jesus died than it was before. the view that I tend to prefer though I still think there is something to be learned from the first is called the Christus Victor view. According to this view as I understand it it is not God who demanded our punishment but Satan and because we sided with him by doing evil he had some legal claim on us. God instead offered him Jesus but then there was that whole rising from the dead by which Jesus defeated Satan and freed humanity from him. I hope that helps answer your question a bitAll the best ,Documentaries,cmaeba5,1,t5_2qhlh

2429041,0,t1_cmbszai,gt They have no issues with openly hurting close friends feelings and then immediately acting as if they did nothing for example I would argue that is a result of strict rules. Your evaluation of the two UK schools as extreme versions of the school in OP could very well be wrong.It is important for small children to hit other children and hurt them. When they do that the child whom they hurt will start crying. The child who did the hurting will empathize with the pain and realize that that is something they wouldnt like to be done to them. This is a well known psychological phenomenon and is a very important part of growing up.Children who were always protected or stopped before they could make an impact by helicopterparents never learn why they shouldnt do it. They just see it as an arbitrary rule set forth by an authority. Once that authority is gone they feel they can resume the behavior and no one can stop them. ,Documentaries,cmbxq3h,-8,t5_2qhlh

If you put that many humans in a room youd find some with physical disabilities as well. In other words how can we be sure the video creator isnt just cherry picking sad shots in an attempt to persuade us that physical issues are a large problem? We really cant. If people want the chickens to be treated better then they have to be prepared for the price of chicken to go up substantially. There would be hefty costs associated with the comfort of these animals. Do you think people would still buy chicken at the higher price or go buy a different cheaper meat from animals still treated poorly? I think if were being honest we know that people will go for the cheaper meat in general. It is very easy for us to sit here and say Oh those poor chickens are not treated well. They should be treated better! but then we go to the store and our actions are to buy the cheapest meat. The best value for our dollar. Theres potential for a lot of hypocrisy there.I think that at the end of the day the cost of meat being so cheap by efficiencies gained through inhumane means has led to such economic benefits that the majority has agreed with their wallets that this is a necessary but not honorable process. It will always be a stain on us and I dont think many people out there if any are proud of it but when talking about providing cheap food to the masses you run into such ethical dilemmas where living creatures are viewed as raw material waiting to be produced into a final good.

2566926,0,t3_2p4sil,Near the beginning he indicates he delved deeply into philosophy  having only first encountered it at Berkley  and the importance of virtues and ethics and how he focused on those things. He also feely admits had we lost world war  hed already have been tried for war crimes. By refusing to fully comment on what he feels his responsibility was for Vietnam was  a war the US has never openly admitted to losing or winning  he effectively admits he is guilty given the way the documentary and earlier interviews were laid out. The fact there is that one part before Vietnam is discussed where the interview allows us or presents to us the idea that McNamara is calling the shots in terms of the way these interviews are organized lends to the clearly suggested idea that he is absolutely guilty but effectively very lucky to have existed when he did and always be in the right or at worst in the grey. He is certainly a brilliant and charismatic person who could easily be choosing to frame it in the best possible way while also appearing convincing but he never discussed an interest in the dramatic arts and the way he got choked up over JFK and that he did leave a multimillion dollar job in the name of doing the best job he could for his country I believe he did what he thought was right and was being sincere about it. I think he knows he was wrong but just as he said in the film it is with the benefit of retrospect. I came into this with the general idea is a war criminal and I dont think he really tries to dissuade that idea. He is a stickler for context perhaps to a degree that may cast less blame than he is owed  and I did see him try to weasel out of admitting when he was cornered  but I genuinely think he let himself get there. McNamara is a genius I also think he is a human being...Thank god my lifetime mistakes probably wont kill anyone but if they do it wont be on the order of millions. Id hope for some benefit of the doubt if everyone thought it was what had to be done at the time.tldr maybe the film is made to serve his interest as a way of getting him to be involved and be so candid. Either way McNamara is a genius who could be heartless and incredibly manipulative for his own interests or he is sincere good or bad. Or the film maker is leading us on. Great film. ,Documentaries,cmtmvzg,13,t5_2qhlh

2680313,0,t1_cn8bbpl,alright. I feel like I need to adress this one by one.gt Parents can EASILY limit internet plans so that their young child doesnt access itInternet is considered mandatory for school research and social development at that age already some people even say as young as  nowadays. The charm is not to keep your kids from it but to teach them how to use it properly.gt or not give their kid a laptop at  I think if you as a parent can afford but not give your kid access to a computer at a young age you are failing them and failing them hard. Our digitalized world is revolving around them. Most professions by now involve extensive and advanced computer use. You NEED to have backend computer skills when you get out of school basicly or your fucked.gt if the kid wants a cell phone get the kid the old flip phones only for use for emergencies theres NO need for a  year old to have a smartphone.Or they can explain to them the concept of self privacy and how to protect it. Its not as easy as saying no you cant but it works.gtAlso dont get cable TV most of the TV on cable programming is just badly written tripe anyway so youre not missing much and the regular broadcast channels dont have all that sexualized crap on it the FCC is a thing Parents also need to get to know the parents of their friends so if they want to go to friend As house the parent needs to visit the other parent see if they are lazy with internet cable tv etc and if they are NOT LET THEM GOSome a grade bullshit there. You WILL NOT AND CAN NEVER prevent kids from making their own experiences in every aspect of growing up without seriously harming their social development. I really hope no one actually thinks that because in my opinion that would border on child abuse.gt if the kid says they need the internet to do school work TAKE THEM TO THE LIBRARY! One youll spend some more time with you child and youll be able to teach them how to use a library and not be dependent on internet.The internet IS ABSOLUTELY MANDATORY for school work nowadays. The library has computers with internet access and easy research courses because they realize this. In Germany it is considered child abuse and grounds for getting custody taken to prevent kids from doing their school work by preventing them from accessing the internet.gt Also parents absolutely must teach their kids about sex when they bring it up Where do babies come from Yes but never go for the abstinence only shit because there is no single tactic in parenting that works worse then to say just dont do it trust me. If you dont believe me read up on the streisand effect.Parents need to help guide their kids but also let them make their own experiences.

The United States and Britain fought the war of course but not primarily against Nazi Germany. The war against Nazi Germany was fought by the Russians. The German military forces were overwhelmingly on the eastern front.But the world was better off the student persisted.First of all you have to ask yourself whether the best way of getting rid of Hitler was to kill tens of millions of Russians. Maybe a better way was not supporting him in the first place as Britain and the United States did. O.K.? But youre right it has nothing to do with motivesit has to do with expectations. And actually if youre interested in expectations theres more to say. By Stalingrad in  the Russians had turned back the German offensive and it was pretty clear that Germany wasnt going to win the war. Well weve learned from the Russian archives that Britain and the U.S. then began supporting armies established by Hitler to hold back the Russian advance.

2746274,0,t3_2rhsuu,I absolutely do not condone such destruction and believe that such disputes should be resolved by peaceful means and dialog.However looking at the events at the Babri Mosque about which this documentary is in  is like looking at the last action in a protracted fight and concluding that the last guy who slapped the other was the initiator. As in many sports the one who retaliates is often considered at fault when the fault lies with the guy who initiated it.Babri Mosque is named after Babar and many people believe that he destroyed an existing Ram temple to build the mosque. It wouldnt be the first time that a conquering Muslim ruler had destroyed a temple youll find such destruction all over North India see for example the timeline of Somnath Temple In  the Archeological Survey of India released a report after excavations and concluded that while they couldnt find any mention of a temple youd be hardpressed to find mentions of temples on Indian temples there was evidence of a large structure underneath consistent with a large temple.The fight over this mosque has been going on for s of years so this  episode is not the first skirmish but the latest in a long line.

2757507,0,t1_cnhd3r6,This is not to attack your comment personally as you sound like a reasonable fella.I dont think this documentary was meant to address the issues some people in this thread seem to be ascribing to it. Regardless of the sound clips and tragedy appeal of the documentary it seems the timeline of change in the NRA and in politics in general regarding gun rights has been reactionary and often linked to gun violence related events that received national attention. The format of the documentary seemed to follow an Event gt Result linear timeline.The documentary is about the NRA and I didnt feel like it took too strong a stance on the arguments of gun control. I think it did a pretty good job explaining the context of frustration regarding tragedies and in explaining you cant just change something with  opposition.I think asking for more statistics about firearms used to defend themselves and firearms abuse is important but not the topic of a documentary talking about the politics of the NRA like money spent on campaigns and platform strategy. ,Documentaries,cnhin1w,10,t5_2qhlh

2761786,0,t3_2rmv4b,I see some people cant watch let me try to give a summary please correct my mistakes I surely made some!Anger arises when expectations are not met. Many of these expectations are irrational. When speaking to the delivery man he asks if he gets angry at other drivers. Of course he says whenever they swerve cut him off are rude make a mistake etc. The host then asks how often this happens to which he replies every single day all the time. The host then asks why if every day is the same that he expects the day to go differently? Why is the driver so surprised that he encountered a bad driver which is the standard to him? Isnt he simply setting himself up for disappointment every day? Thats all anger is a reflexive reaction that compels us to change something unexpected and perceived as harmful. Does this mean we should accept all ills lie down and wait for the world to crash upon us? No there are a multitude of possibilities life isnt black and white. He gives an example of the dog being pulled by a chariot. Even though the dog does not wish to follow he has two choices be dragged along strangled and mangled or follow as best as it could even if it didnt want. In either case he follows but one choice leaves him in agony.He then retells one of Senecas stories of a noble roman who was so furious when a slave broke a simple glass that he made him be devoured alive by a swarm of lampreys. He also spoke of Nero who would inflict the cruelest and honestly most imaginative forms of execution on those he deemed unworthy such as failed gladiators or just the simple poor. He then brings us to a modern day airport and asks who is more likely to throw a fit the one in business class or economy? You know this answer wealth raises expectations of life such as glass becoming unbreakable or never being seated next to a crying baby on a fully booked flight even though you believe your wealth elevates you above such peasants. Be a little more pessimistic but dont obsess. Simply acknowledge that as a mortal you are not capable of applying your will indiscriminately to reality to the contrary this rarely if ever happens. When certain things occur in your world know they have happened and nothing you could have done or felt would have made a difference. Be mindful and carry on.Of course this is before mental illness was known. There are those who simply do not fair well in Fortunes eyes born with defective circuitry and a lot in life that moulds one into a twisted abomination beyond their control who do not need any external triggers to be filled to the brim with burning anxiety that flays their insides and leaves them but a husk.,Documentaries,cni069w,7,t5_2qhlh

Sex workers are as broad as any demographic comprised of people from all walks of life. The public typically only gets exposed to the easier better understood by the masses targets.I once met an exlawyer single mom of two teenaged children who gave up law for touring as a stripper after appearing in a special professions Playboy issue. She made about twice as much and put her oldest daughter through law school with the money she was making. Im a photographer by trade and have met a very broad spectrum of sex workers over the years.

All their interactions with people are negative.  People associate the badge with those negative experiences.

2993609,0,t1_co863hw,Youve said absolutely nothing that proves any point. So you dont get that nothing comes before God thats exactly what Im saying. When it comes to God you want a God to come before a God but if its any other source the same damn logic applies! Any form of matter antimatter even nothingness. There was no time before time but something started the process. You can say we simply were and still it would mean something caused us to be where we are now. I think you just have a flawed understanding of God because of how religions portray God. The fact that you asked me  what God came before that God pretty much shows you dont understand. So theres no point in arguing. You can keep saying what came before God and I can keep saying God. Were just not meant to be able to comprehend it at some point we have to come to come to an assumption.Im not saying you have to believe in God but I do have a problem that you think its irrational. You calling me cancerous just shows your arrogance. ,Documentaries,co8aag1,2,t5_2qhlh
3003676,0,t1_co9b7ne,gt You just refuse to accept that YA is how workers get compensatied but Ymarket is how CEOs get compensated where Ya represent the ACTUAL value created by the worker and the Ymarket is the value created by the worker AND all other factors. In what world do you think the value CEOs bring isnt affected by the market? gtAnd in many cases that value x is very high compared to flipping burgers which is why its okay to compensate others more than others just so long as the compensation is tied to work they actually did and is not benefiting from the labor of others. So bosses who delegate and manage labor is....?gtWHICH LEADS TO VAST DISTORTIONS OF VALUE FOR EXECUTIVES!gtIm showing why that is fundamentally flawed because it rewards A for the value of x which increased by the labor of people who arent A!!!!!Except the part where you ignore that A isnt just for workers. Managing capital and labor is also part of A for those who do it.You just dont like they make more. You think it takes no effort to acquire decades of experience to manage laborcapital and zero risk in vetting those one hires to do it for you.gtNo its not. Its actually a new way of thinking that  for once  considers the looks at where the value of things actually come from which is almost never solely the work of an executive but rather the collective result of work done by a large group of people. And it turns out the executive isnt solely compensated.gtFor example what happened to Apple after Steve Jobs died? Did it suddenly become a worthless pile of crap? Turns out other people also know how to manage capital and labor. gtThe fact that you switch out the CEO and remain profitable is bonafide proof that the institution and the labor of all of the employees and the money of all of the consumers is THE MOST IMPORTANT thing producing the billions of dollars. Thats horrible logic. You could replace all the employees and remain profitable too. You could shift production into a different market and have different consumers and again still possible to be profitable.Theres nothing special or new to what youre saying.

Theres a thing called intelligence that is used to help determine who is who. The US doesnt just go trigger happy and kill everyone. Well they know that hence why they dont wear uniforms at all.

I knew it was a fad and I took total advantage of it. eBay was still new and helped me flip them every couple of days. I was getting Money Orders in my mailbox almost endlessly...   . The money was just too good to be true. I was working at a little cardgift shop at the time and was able to pick whichever one of the little shitty toys before they ever hit the shelf plus I bought them from the owner at wholesale  with my employee discount. People still have tons of questions about this and laugh at me whenever it awkwardly gets brought up at work or over a few drinks. Its definitely not something they expect. They stop laughing when I tell them how much I made. It was awesome.Most of the money went towards weed a computer art supplies books meals out and beer. Ah college.

3038275,0,t3_2uxiyp,Ive lived in south Florida Tampa for  years now. Im from Maryland and have succumbed to loving the state and the kind of weather that is so unrealistically and reliably pleasant. But I definitely feel like Im on a peninsula of lotus eaters who have forgotten their drive in life by simply sleeping getting high or intoxicated and stringing together a jumbled philosophy on life. As others have mentioned Florida has tons of people who are from other states but just end up living out the rest of their lives here. Those that were actually born here are as normal as their family income allows them to be. Local florida trashy is the type of guy in the video who appeared in his early twenties but was showing off which of the many tattoos were representative of his  kids. Theyre the type that id imagine keeps KMarts alive.Walmarts here at night are the type of thing that make you sad and angry at people at the same time. Ive bought a woman with a handicapped mentally and in a wheel chair son food after listening to her  minute long speech about a hurricane displacing her family months ago and the government failing her. Then when I came out of the store with my groceries and found her to give her some I saw her and her son was no longer wheel chair bound and also was carrying on a conversation with his mom. I had to remind her like twice what I was offering her pastas for.Also if youre in some parts of town after  a.m. and you have to stop for gas someone is going to come up to you that looks exactly  like one of the people from the video with missing teeth and tell you a story about needing money to take the bus. Its still a great place with great people but its not the south it has a vague touristy state identity and it just feels a bit skeevy. Just last week my girlfriend and I were leaving Ybor a bit past midnight and we had just gotten in a fight so we were driving in complete silence. After five minutes without a word or each other turning our heads we get to a red light and two homeless guys Id say early s were crossing the street. All of a sudden they start arguing and they punch each other in the face about three times each. Even in the car with the windows up you could hear the heavy slapping sound of fist heading face. They had walked away from each other yelling before the light changed but it was so weird and out of the blue made even more surreal that my girlfriend and I werent talking or addressing the two homeless people fighting three feet in front of our car. Also salt life highly raised muddin trucks tackily accessorized trucks with chrome flames always driven by latinos women who look like wrinkled leather and whose voices sound like theyve smoked since birth. ,Documentaries,cocwzk8,6,t5_2qhlh

Haliburton and co? no i dont think so. Haliburton raked in profits while we fit the bill. how does that not make sense to you? you act like chenney gave a shit how much the war cost americans. not to mention he thought the war would cost  what the war actually cost because he doesnt know shit about military operations.gtDoes it make sense that the U.S. Invaded Iraq for its unaccounted for WMDs and to depose a tyrant who invaded his neighbors on two occasions used chemical weapons mass murdered his own citizens was the only head of state to praise the  attacks and had a long history of supporting terrorist groups including jihadist terror groups? In the aftermath of  it seems only reckless not to.lol WOW. so you think preemptively attacking any country that fit that criteria would be a smart move? There are a lot of other countries that fit that bill RIGHT NOW. why do you think we arent attacking them? guess we cant ask other countries not to preemptively attack any other country they choose now because we are such a horrible example. who made us the world police by the way? too many fucking moronic war mongers in our country that love the idea of blowing up muslims.gtDid the U.S. invade Afghanistan to go after the Saudis that attacked on ? No.. They died in planes along with the innocents they hijacked and the thousands in the World Trade Center. But the U.S. Did invade to go after their Saudi ringleader Osama bin laden who was in Afghanistan as a guest of the Taliban government who refused to detain him and transfer him into US custody. Bin laden had set up training camps for jihadists to flock to in preparation for attacks throughout the world.Oh we invaded a country to get Osama? How did that work out? Was he there? More than  coalition troops are dead. do you think we prevent more coalition casualties than that? Not to mention the trillion spent. Do you think we destroyed more training centers than we created by killing innocent people?gtAs for any acts of murder of innocents in Iraq by US troops theyre treated as the serious crimes that they are and its incredibly stupid to compare it to the systematic and statesanctioned extermination of Jews in the Holocaust. Its equally stupid to fail to point out that the U.S. avoids killing civilians whereas its enemies purposely target maim crucify and enslave them.Great. And how about that torture? How many US military have gone to prison so far? A lot? Cause a lot of innocent people have been killed and its fueling terrorist recruitment all over the world. Who fucking cares what the enemies have done? As long as we are better than them we can behave like fucking morons? Do you think if our military had never touched down in the middle east in the s that maybe just maybe  would have never happened?gtThe absurd and forced effort to find moral equivalency between the U.S. and the slavers and murderous thugs who hold the rights of man in complete contempt is exactly the obfuscating and diversionary tactics that has become characteristic of the lefts response to Islamic totalitarianism that has turned me away from them. I didnt want to be a useful idiot for slavers and murderers.

3159778,0,t3_2wb3sr,Going to CopyPasta from a previous post I made. Seems like a good fit hereLovecraft is an underrated conceptualist. When you take his work in the context of the times it was written its pure genius. He plays on the fear of a very large and uncaring eternity.Many new ideas were coming to the forefront of the publics mind in those days and most of those ideas scared the shit out of them. The then new data regarding the age of the earth and mass extinctions over incomprehensibly vast stretches of time. The discoveries of Edwin Hubble which suddenly showed an inkling of the true scale of the universe. Man was looking more and more unimportant. Less and less like the center of the universe and more and more like the trilobites found fossilized in sedimentary layers. This was and still is a difficult shock for many people. A sudden feeling of disquieting dread can sometimes accompany this revelation.That is what Lovecraft is playing on and it no doubt had an impact much greater than it does today in an age where these facts are mostly common knowledge. He invented the aliens as ancient gods and magic as incomprehensible science tropes. Most of us have seen these themes repeated in myriad interpretations throughout modern science fiction. They were utterly new concepts in Lovecrafts time.He creates global extinction sized monsters that are as whales to our being as krill. He presents an uncaring universe in which our entire civilization has merely been ripening for the harvest. Its a terrifying idea and one that still feels chilling today.He also infuses his tales with unseen entities just outside our perception to invoke strong feelings of trapped hopelessness. Mere exposure to these beings or their artifacts forever infect the victim and there is no escape. Only futile attempts to delay the inevitable. The protagonist can never be alone or safe. Because of what he or she now knows they can never be safe again and probably never were in the first place. But the truth however ugly is so compelling that they invariably hasten their downward spiral in the pursuit of it. To reinforce the suspension of disbelief he writes in the style of a field journal. A style anyone with a casual interest in nature or the sciences would have been familiar with. Considering the era in which these works were written they must have been quite disturbing.,Documentaries,copic3f,70,t5_2qhlh

The last time it was seriously enforced was in  and after that it just collapsed around itself reparations would further be sliced in half and then forgiven entirely in . If France and Britain forced Germany to pay the reparations that it could pay but chose not to see Sally Marks work on this if you dont believe its common academia at this point but she does it best Britain and especially France would have been on better legs to counter Germanys actions in . If France and Britain had actually enforced the limits on the German military war would not have happened in the first place. If France and Britain stopped the reoccupation of the Rhine Hitler would not have had any funny ideas. War happened because France and Britain thought peace beget more peace and no one would want to break it. If they were proactive in keeping it it would have been attained.

3301239,0,t3_2xyj7i,I am very much interested in learning about from documentaries and otherwise how deception is manufactured and promulgated within the United States and the results thereof both domestic and abroad.  Below is a list of documentaries I have held on to after years sifting documentaries I have learned from even if I disagreed with particular points they made.  Documentaries I hope other people on this subreddit can learn from.  Even though they range in topic from the Waco Texas incident to questioning the morality of advertising to children I believe there is a common theme of deception which is what generally interests me as an individual.  A topic which I believe the artform is naturally efficacious in addressing.This list is by no means exhaustive and I certainly hope others will chime in and add to it.  Also remember this is simply a personal list that I have decided to make public because I believe others can benefit from it.  There are quite a few documentaries listed here that question the official story of September th an issue that seems quite divisive even on this very open minded subreddit.  Regardless of their conclusions I find them to be very worthwhile exercises in thought if nothing else and so I have included them.  As with anything else you can of course disagree with the ideas they put forward but to summarily dismiss them is I believe unfair and shortsighted.If you have trouble finding any of these online comment here and I can try and help.

3302048,0,t1_cp4akkj,An understandable misconception but  untrue. We hold businesses to different standards all the time. Common carriers companies who provide transportation services can be held strictly liable. In other words a plaintiff need not prove the defendants were even at fault whatsoever. Think about that the company can be held liable for damages even if they are NOT AT FAULT AT ALL. Pretty powerful. Same goes for product manufacturers who can be held strictly liable for a defective product.Manufacturers can even be held liable when the product isnt defective at all but when it fails to function properly when someone uses it in a way it wasnt intended but which is reasonably foreseeable. Example I buy a chair and then stand on it to change a light bulb. The chair breaks and I hurt myself. In this instance the chair manufacturer may be liable even though the chair was clearly not designed for standing on because it is reasonable for the manufacturer to foresee that the chair would be used for such a purpose.These are all simplified explanations but you get the point.

This phenomenon is extremely sensitive to geometric imperfections and asymmetries. In the case of WTC the fire and plane impact created these asymmetries that ultimately reduced the towers buckling load to the structures dead weight. At that point the tower then collapsed nearly instantaneously at the acceleration of the dead load ie the acceleration of gravity.  ,Documentaries,cpfcvcv,3,t5_2qhlh

Misprescription by individual doctors doesnt make the drugs themselves bad. If you give someone a knife they can use it to prepare you a nice meal or to kill you. Does that make the knife bad? The drugs are tools which help in some specific cases and can be harmful in others.If you think that acunpuncturists and herbalists arent in it for the money then you are wrong. I agree with you that big pharma is bad but turning to a much less effective outdated and archaic faithbased medicine whose proponents are equally greedy aint a solution my friend!It seems to me your greatest wish is for your beliefs in faithbased medicine to be affirmed not for everyone to be relieved of suffering.

What Im talking about isnt conspiracy theory bullshit.  Its fact.  Again if Im wrong I await your evidence.I would argue that removing the mechanism of liability is far more dangerous to your partner than anything Ive suggested here....which is simply that a mechanism of liability protection should exist on ANY product and that ANY company that makes a product should be held accountable for the action that product has on its consumer.Its not that difficult of a point to understand...yet Im the moron?,Documentaries,cpwjivs,1,t5_2qhlh

I recognize however that this may not be a popular stance because its easier to label people a certain way and dismiss their arguments on those grounds.Lets say there is such a point. Does the kind of society you grew up in not influence your own view on where this point lies?

I found this  June  Madonna was rushed to the Cedars Sinai hospital for an Xray after her thenhusbandSean Penn hit her across the head with a baseball bat. At the time they had been having a hearttoheart talk about reconciling.Madonna did not make an official complaint because Penn was about to serve a short jail term for attacking a film extra and violating the probation hed been given for punching a fan. It was a decision she would come to regret. In the late afternoon of December   Penn scaled the wall surrounding the Malibu house and found Madonna alone in the master bedroom.According to a report filed by Madonna with the Malibu sheriffs office the two began to quarrel. Penn told her he owned her lock stock and barrel. When she told him she was leaving the house he tried to bind her hands with an electric cord. Screaming and afraid Madonna fled from the bedroom. Penn chased her into the living room caught her and bound her to a chair with heavy twine. Then he threatened to shave her hair. Penn was drinking liquor straight from the bottle and the abuse went on for nine hours during which he smacked and forced Madonna to perform a degrading sex act on him.He went out to buy more alcohol leaving Madonna bound and gagged. Some hours later he returned and continued his attacks then finally untied her. Madonna then fled the house and ran to her car. Penn ran after her and was banging on the windows of her Thunderbird while she spoke to police on her mobile phone.

I think the choices of salesmen werent great the exotic car salesman was a bit of an arrogant tosser not very likeable in my opinion. Whereas the low end salesman was likeable but not cut out for the situation for example gushing over the office and super cars wasnt the most charming and well spoken chap so was bound to fail not to mention his not being arsed to learn the details of the cars. It was also lopsided in that the supercar guy goes to meet the used car guys family whereas it seems the used car guy was not worthy of that. Same with the fact that the supercar guy got paid the used car guys wage but the other guy just got his own wage and the proper salary wasnt even mentioned.

Infact the highest paid CEOs are the worst performers Its not rocket science or some inscrutable economic dynamics. Its simply a . country club of the first water and employees are paying for it through reduced compensation in the form of increased productivity flat wages reduced retirement funding and bearing a dramatically increased burden of healthcare costs.  Taxpayers are also victims of another massive transfer of wealth to the top . in the form of taxpayerbacked federal bailouts to banks and institutional investors who were deemed too big to fail which turned around and issued multimilliondollar bonuses to top executives.Even fucking RadioShack which went bankrupt in February managed to get approval of .M in bonuses to its top  executives after defaulting on severance payments to laidoff employees.

Each year the fed generates billions in profit people always say that this money is passed on to the tresury but they always fail to mention that these shareholders each get a  dividend first. The argument here is that these banks are not really shareholders because they cant sell the shares but why would anyone want to sell shares in a organisation that always make profit? ,Documentaries,cr3ft6j,0,t5_2qhlh
3925372,0,t1_cr3ft6j,If you would like some of those misconceptions cleared up I could explain them to you...Take your profit example The fed creates money billions a year but it isnt profit it isnt money left over from a job done it IS the job creating money. The billions upon billions of dollars of profit that our banking sector earns from the job they do towers over the amount of money created by the fed and deposited for the sake of keeping our economy healthy.If you think member banks profit from the fed well you and I profit from it just as much. We all enjoy the strongest economy in the world in part because of our federal reserve bank. Member banks dont build their value or their wealth from the amounts deposited by the fed They arent allowed to... itd be against the rules of how that money is regulated to be loaned and the bank that attempted it would no longer be a member bank.Like I said wherever you are getting this information is lying to you. The fed isnt dangerous it isnt private it isnt some mysterious thing that people can t understand.If youre geniuinely interested then learn about it.

To the point that Jeffrey managed to become an alcoholic by the time he was in highschool.Add to this the turmoil of his closeted homosexuality and how he turned out isnt that surprising.However I do recall having been around when the Dahmer case was blowing up in the press that in the early tellings of his story there was a tendency to portray his upbringing as being pretty normal.

3939538,0,t1_cr5927s,Ok so lets say that you inherited your wealth. Your grandfather created a company worth M and you inherited this company during his passing. You dont want to risk your net worth on this company so you sell it for M through financial markets and buy less risky bonds worth M but returning you only  per year. You are entitled to that wealth because your grandfather created the wealth for the world and passed it onto you. Your money grows because instead of spending it you have invested it into the bonds. Thus you deserve the  per year because you are taking the risk of the bonds and you allowed someone else to invest the money on your behalf. No matter what you do with your wealth if you invest instead of spend you are entitled to the proceeds.As for your political influence point I have no idea what you are talking about. How do you buy political influence that makes wealth generation unobtainable for other people? Everybody has the ability to create their own companies or invest their own earnings into stocks as well and no matter how much you spend on lobbying you cannot take that away from other people nor would you want to because you want the economy to have more useful products.gtcapitalist countries are almost all economically shit. How many arent in insane amounts of debt?You are under the assumption that debt is a bad thing which it isnt. Debt is a great thing especially for countries. If a country takes on debt it is usually quite a safe investment for investors. That is why countries who issue debt with a good credit rating often recieve debt at lower interest rates than the rate of inflation. Why is it a bad thing to take on a loan at a  interest rate when you can spend the money on improving your education system or infrastructure which ends up improving the economy of that country by lets say  and as such more taxable by  and thus your economy is better off by  per year? Of course too much debt is a bad thing and we see the effects of this in countries like Greece but the reason why Greece is in so much shit now is not only due to the tremendous debt that they took on but also due to them not having control over their own money supply the Euro. If the US takes on too much debt and investors realize this and lower the US credit rating the US could print more money to give the investors thus deflating the value of the dollar and this will boost its economy somewhat. Greece cannot do anything similar because it cannot print Euros.And the phrase economically shit is very ignorant. In order to have a shit economy you have to have a benchmark economy to compare to. If I stated that Indias economy is shit I would be correct when comparing to the economy of modern day UK but I would be wrong when comparing it to the economy of Vietnam or the UK  years ago. So compared to what country are capitalist countries economically shit? In fact if we take into consideration the world economy capitalist countries are on the top almost every time with very few exceptions.,Documentaries,cr5cal7,1,t5_2qhlh

If I were to be keeping my own private journal of my time spent with an ideologically extreme group I would like to clarify what that ideology is and where it came from rather than just what it looks like on the very surface. Let alone if someone is making a doc for public consumption it should be obvious that you should do some damn journalism. Just putting a camera on someone is lazy and often more destructive than constructive. Methodology may look more sensational but the epistemology and ontology are where the story is actually at its a shame that the story wasnt told in this case. Just making one group of people look stupid to a group of people who already thought they were stupid is unhelpful you need to show that the root of the stupidity is false belief ignorance and a failure to educate oneself thus putting the onus on the believers to question their own beliefs instead of making a doc that is just for some sort of base arousal due to the eminent prospect of violence.,Documentaries,cr5dejl,2,t5_2qhlh

Maybe because it was the most convenient thing to not do anything so they didnt have to raise taxes under influence of that decision.

Theyve been seeing their market shrinking for decades.Manufacturing jobs in automotive production for example arent strictly menial labor but they are highly repetitive tasks that can be learned without extensive education.Look at the self checkout lines in retail.

Im not saying youre like that and I know you are likely just providing insight because you have a more nuanced view not coming from passion.And then alsoif you must kill them and you dont care that you are killing innocents why not kill them humanely.So for me it comes down to people not caring that they are killing innocents and not caring that they are killing innocents in a torturous manner. I dont really see how justifying it as public vengeance changes my points about not caring about having innocents killed and not caring about killing innocents in a torturous manner.,Documentaries,cs6g17y,20,t5_2qhlh

If you put your  in the bank they can lend out  as a loan and must keep  on hand as a  reserve requirement.The money multiplier effect comes from the fact your  is still considered cash to you you can transfer it write a cheque etc. and the  lent out as a loan is also cash as they can make payments with it too. So you now have  effectively in circulation.You can keep this scenario running as say that  loaned out is used to purchase goods and the receiver of the  deposits their money at the bank. The bank now has total deposit liabilities of  and with a  reserve requirement needs to keep . on hand. So they are free to lend out . of the  deposited which originally came from  of the first  deposit. So now in circulation we have ..An easy way to think of this is if there is only  of real money in the economy and it is all deposited at the bank and the bank is only required to keep  of real money in reserves they can effectively loan out    or create  of virtual money if all loans return to the bank as deposits.,Documentaries,csgo68d,1,t5_2qhlh

I thought you were trying to say that citizens in the U.S. were less sympathetic relative to other western countries because our government is constantly at war. The distinct between the U.S. government and its citizens is appalling. The government doesnt represent the people in this country. Im sure its like that in most places too. I know most Canadians hate their leaders. To go back to OPs comment though I think theres merit in him saying hes  white  male and  from middle class America. I am also those three things. Being white male and from the western world growing up in the middle class we are more privileged than any other group in the world. Its relevant to acknowledge that we have privileges other people dont have even women blacks or minorities who are also middle class westerners.

Many of these parents havent much experience with this topic and they seem only to be responding to their childrens wishes which is beneficial in the long term.Sure this is a very adult topic but science proves time and time again that homosexuals are born homosexual and so too are transgender people.

But those dont have as much negative consequences as banning FREE POLITICAL SPEECH.gtHow would somebody like Bush get elected in that environment in the first place? He also doesnt have the authority to do this anyway.He got elected because he campaigned as a moderate and to evangelicals. Al Gore messed up by not inviting Bill Clinton to campaign with him. And Bill Clinton messed up by having sex with an intern and then perjuring himself.  Al Gore was also not that strong of a candidate either.Theres plenty of legitimate reasons why Bush won. Mainly though he barely won because of a supreme court case.But if Al Gore performed only a little better or if Bush performed only a little worse then Al Gore would have won.gtBy the way writing all things in caps is never an effective strategy. Its a great strategy. I am shocking you back into reality. You are not considering the consequences of what ideas you are proposing. This can have TERRIBLE backlashes to the point where you will regret ever mentioning this idea of restricting free speech just because you hate the rich.

He made a pithy statement.The thing is if it a medical practice is proven then it would qualify as evidence based medicine which puts in firmly within the realms of current medical best practice. It wouldnt generally be referred to as alternative in this case.On the other side of the fence the dark secret of medicine is that a crapton of traditional orthodox practice is not evidence based and a great many of those decisions made by medical practice on the basis of experience dont hold up to real scientific rigour.So we cannot pretend that orthodox medicine is all  scientific practice.

5113809,0,t1_cv27y91,A couple things that I can say as a woman on the internet who has used dating sites a few times. Dating sites have the same problem most websites have  anonymity. When people arent facetoface with someone they tend to be dicks. More on this in no . Many people are insecure and whoever messages first is taking the risk so to speak. A woman likes someone because theyre hoping that youll see they liked you and if you find them attractive youll like them back or message them. If an insecure person likes you or winks or whatever and then nothing happens in return they lose all confidence and dont take it to the level where they message you too. Theyre reluctant to open themselves up to the rejection and the potential for abuse and mockery. Women often choose to ignore messages from people theyre not interested in because being nice sometimes blows up in your face. Not every guy is appreciative and you get replies back like lol. I was drunk when I messaged you. I dont actually date fat chicks or Youre an ugly bitch. You should be thankful that someone that looks looks like me wasted their time messaging you. Theres an endless variety of these messages. I felt sorry for you. I was just looking for an easy lay by browsing the discard pile. If you browse through rcreepyPMs youll see that sometimes nicely turning a guy down will result in him threatening to rape and murder you for being a stuckup piece of shit.After you get a couple messages back calling you a bitch and a whore just for trying to be nice. You stop. Women get a lot of messages. I once made a fake OKC profile just to lurk and look at profiles my friend was linking me to. I went onto Google and found the least attractive stock photo I could find. The picture I chose showed an extremely obese woman in a muumuu eating. I got dozens of messages. I got dozens and dozens of messages until someone finally reported me for using a fake picture and it was removed.Of course some women are assholes just like some men are and just ignore messages because theyre too lazy to bother.But if a woman likes you who you find attractive and are interested in why not just send her a message?

5169972,0,t1_cv92ku2,If you were taking a cruise ship in that area then you needed a passport because ships that are registered outside of the US i.e. all cruise ships large enough to sail that far away from the mainland aside from the Pride of America are required to stop in a foreign port at some point during their trip. Thus you need your passport  for the ship itself since the ship itself is foreign and  to stop in the legally required foreign port.Now if we had an American company create a large cruise ship that would be owned by an American company and staffed mostly by Americans with an itinerary that takes you around mainland Florida the US Virgin Islands Puerto Rico and the Florida Keys then you could take a Caribbean cruise that wouldnt require a passport and instead just a drivers license for governmentissued photo ID.You wouldnt need a passport for such a voyage for the same reason you dont need to bring your passport when flying from Chicago to Houston or driving across a number of states.,Documentaries,cv96780,1,t5_2qhlh

5174959,0,t3_3lsgoq,Sex trafficking is an exaggerated hoax.What they want us to believe is that women from poor countries are rounded up imprisoned and then transported to rich countries and forced to have sex with lots of men theyve never met before and they arent being paid for this and the cant leave or get away.So they must have people to round up the women either by luring them through ads or abducting them. Then they must guard these women feed them cloth them etc. But they must also train them to be good sex workers. Then they have to get them across international borders and then house them in the new country with guards and locks etc. Then after doing all they can to keep them locked up they must allow them to interact with men who came to have sex. These women are victims and their captors are criminals with a big secret. Yet they are going to allow the women to interact with men who think they are engaging with a willing prostitute. So after going through all the expense to catch house feed train and imprison these women in a highly illegal operation which has already committed multiple major felonies they are going to allow the women to talk to thousands of men every year. Yet they cant really find that many sex slavery operations? Im no criminal but this has to be the dumbest and riskiest criminal enterprise Ive ever heard of. Its highly illegal and easy as fuck to get caught. Yet no one is getting caught? The fact is that there are millions of women who engage in prostitution in poor countries who would love to come to a rich country and be a prostitute for  to  times as much money. Do you really think those women have to be forced into it? Confined with armed guards? Sex Slavery is a Feminist wet dream. Nothing gets women off more than imagining that men will do almost anything and risk almost anything just to have sex with women. Its a fucking fantasy.  And it makes these organizations millions of dollars through donations and government grants. They have no incentive to tell the truth and every incentive to invent inflated numbers and statistics to create more hysteria. Its a fraud.,Documentaries,cv9rtsu,-1,t5_2qhlh

Someone invests in RampD someone copies someone invests in RampD again and creates something better a generic copies and again and thus competition and the impetus to keep researching and innovating goes on. I think its great. The problem is when people fail to see the contribution of both parts to this equation which most do. Most of the comments in this thread are testament to that. Demonising one part makes no sense at all. The existence of both is necessary to the advancement of world health until the day that governments carry out the function and bear the burden of investment in RampD.

How much more formal can you get than the German Chancellor giving a speech or the German government erecting a massive monument to the victims in the capital or the German Bundestag setting aside an hour each year for speeches dedicated to the victims of the holocaust? I cant imagine what you think would be more formal.Youre making a really incredible argument here that Germany hasnt formally apologized for the holocaust. To me that says that youre just completely ignorant of German politics and society.There have been countless formal apologies I linked three recent ones earlier but German remembrance of the holocaust goes far beyond mere formal statements. People in the country are very aware of their countrys dark thcentury history. Its a major theme in German postwar art and politics. Ill give you one small example of how you encounter this issue every day in Germany. Walk through the streets of almost any large German city and youll come across small bronze plaques set in the road outside various houses. If you stop to read the inscriptions youll see that they bear the name of someone who lived in that building with the date and place that they were murdered by the Nazis. The idea is that people going about their everyday lives should every once in a while stumble over one of these plaques read it and be reminded of Germanys history.,Documentaries,cvhtk5z,1,t5_2qhlh

5414459,0,t1_cw3r2o4,gtSleep paralysis while making people feel like it is paranormal is not paranormal.I agree.gtI assumed the film was using the experiences as a build up to an explanation to what sleep paralysis actually is  an interesting biological neural phenomenaI too was expecting this. Where we differ here is that Im glad this didnt happen because I am primarily interested in the subjective experience of the phenomena.gtBut if the whole film is about people talking about their trippy feelings while experiencing sleep paralysis then that makes this documentary even more useless and irritating.Not in my opinion. It just took a different look at the experience than what you were expecting. Doesnt make it pointless or useless  clearly the documentary offered a personal insight of sleep paralysis that isnt as well conveyed by a scientist talking head lecturing from the screen.gtI might as well be watching  minutes of Ancient Aliens or Ghost Hunters.Sorry but that is a stupid analogy. Both of those shows are clearly trying to convince their audience of a viewpoint  that aliens built the pyramids and that ghosts are real or whatever. They both have a standpoint on the issue that they are trying to convey.This does not apply to this documentary. Yes a few of the sufferers clearly believe what they experience is supernatural. I disagree with these people. A few of the others clearly think its all in the head. I agree with these people. Yet I didnt feel the director was trying to push me to believe one thing or the other. It was left up to me.What you appear to want to happen is a doctor or psychologist to walk in  of the way through look into the camera and tell you not to listen to what these people feel they just have a sleep disorder. You want to be reassured that everybody who watches this documentary has this hammered into their head. And thats fine. Its the format of pretty much every other documentary Ive seen on this subject.

5434156,1,t1_cw68itw,I think the situation in Canada is pretty complicated though... like on one hand you have especially at the University of Ottawa and Carlton University very active and wellfunded student unions and theyve been in the past pretty disproportionately disruptive despite the fact theyre elected by extremely small voterturnout. Theyve taken hardleft positions and been accompanied by the the sort of boneheaded immaturity of college politics a few years back at Carleton they proposed to stop funding for a genetic disease because it mostly only affected people of European ancestry. That said theyre not willfully malicious and theyre not total extremists either they would just be at the left end of the Canadian spectrum theyre into free education native rights fair trade enviromental awareness etc. Actually all things that Canada could probably use more of... and all things that are institutionally supported in Canada but are less popular in the general electorate see Rob Ford supporters the last  years of Conservative power. The student unions have for example always been big gayrights supporters even before gay marriage was legal in Canada. Canada also like Europe but unlike America has hate speech laws which are constantly in a process of negotiation with the court. Its a big debate on whether they go too far... and even its not clear how far they go its really still being worked out. Some people want these totally abolished in favour of an American system others support them... honestly I dont think its a big national priority although it does come up occasionally in discussion.Canada is also sometimes hick as fuck. Despite its international reputation and very liberal legal institutions and liberal institutional history Canadians can be pretty socially conservative. People laugh at Rob Ford but the mayor before him once made a comment about visiting Africa and getting eaten by cannibals... the previous defence minister who just left in the spring called his exgirlfriend who was also an MP a dog in the national parliament the military and the national police forces are plagued with a lack of diversity and years of ongoing sexualassault and harassment lawsuits a guest speaker who was at the military university last fall to talk about harassment was herself aggressively heckled and given an apology later. The last two elections vilified Canadians living abroad and ramped up nationalism over religious accomodation.... and then theres the ongoing treatment of the native peoples....This is getting away from the topic but I guess what Im saying is that discourse in Canada on the topics of feminism and social justice are really active both for and against... and I dont think the students unions are powerful enough to shutdown debate anywhere except in a few limited venues near them and certainly not in a whole university UofO has   students. Heck their actions of shutting down venues are not popular in Canada and every time they do it theres a backlash. Racefeminismfree speech etc. is spoken to from a conservative position by major newspapers like the National Post and even if you take a nonsocialjustice position on some issues... well for the past nine years until today there was a conservative government.Sorry perhaps a bit off topic... but I guess I wanted to add some Canadian national context outside the university world. For the record I do actually agree with you that universities should make students feel safe but also uncomfortable... I guess Im just not convinced that there has been a PCfreespeech chill in Canada at least.,Documentaries,cw69nlc,-1,t5_2qhlh

5443965,0,t1_cw7g49o,gt How come this critique doesnt crop up nearly as much against other movements?It does all the time.The largest criticism of nearly any environmental argument is the counterpoint what has to suffer for your ideal to succeed and how are we going to balance these two factors?  Existing business development industry employment etc. has to suffer in order for environmentalism to succeed and these factors need to be balanced to ensure progress is made in a sustainable and reasonable manner up to a point where you want to attain some stability.  Its the same with feminism what has to suffer?  Originally the preexisting status quo had to suffer to the betterment of gender equality the social privilege of males and suffer it did.  In order for females to be closer to equal the gap needed to be closed and this is ultimately for the benefit of all people.  But there comes a point where its no longer sustainable feasible or even reasonable for it to continue to suffer so that the other side can gain more because the balance point is or has already been attained.  Obviously this is somewhat subjective but the fact that more and more criticism arises in opposition is indicative of this point. To tie back into environmentalism which is a much younger movement than feminism at least in terms of progress there is still a lot of progress that needs to be done in order to balance these opposing factors and make things fair.  We are a long way from attaining some sense of harmony between industrydevelopment and environmental conservation.  However say  or  or  years from now environmentalism has succeeded massively and were at a point of equilibrium what happens now?  Most reasonable people say Well this is pretty good lets try and stabilize here iron out some kinks and do some fine tuning but weve got it pretty worked out.  But people who are radical environmentalist?  People who have been so all their life or who define themselves by their environmental activism?  They dont stop they keep pushing.  Theyll see communities ruined and houses bulldozed so we can turn them into a nature preserve theyll see people laid off and sent home from a building project so they can save some patches of grass and theyll never stop pushing until no trace of opposition exists because they dont want equality or balance they want more for their side.  So now instead of seeing the environmental progress as a good thing the average person starts to see it as a bad thing.  Its not trying to level the playing field and provide balance anymore its just pushing and pushing on in the same direction at the detriment to everything else around it because it can and its been doing it for decades.This is where feminism is at.  Where once it represented the underdog the oppressed the under represented it now pushes past this point of equilibrium.  Where once it was about making things equal and fair its now about making things better for women at the detriment to men and sometimes women! in a way that is no longer seeking equality just seeking more of what they want. gtI rarely see people suggest that an activist is being terribly short sighted or worse doing something morally reprehensible by only focusing on a narrow spectrum of problems rather than try and provide solutions for every possible related issue.Really?  Do you not see people calling out the antiwar protesters or the environmentalists or the immigration activists etc.?Is that not always the first thing people say about any radical form of activism.  The condemnation of environmental activists and ecoterrorists for their lack of awareness and consideration?  The calling out of antiwar protesters for their lack of a better idea and the fact their actions may have an impact on regular people in a negative way?Im not sure if youre being intentionally ignorant of this or if you legitimately dont realise it happens but it certainly does.  And the more successful and more effective these things are the more theyll effect the other side negatively and the more people will start to push back against them.  Thats literally what conservatism is its people saying We dont want the change you want were happy here we think here is good. and in some cases It was good back there youve gone too far!Sure you see more of it against feminism than many other movements... but doesnt that tell you something?  Is that not the point?gtI mean why spend the effort blaming feminists for being narrow minded when in your own view egalitarian humanism is supposed to be able to change things for the better? Why not just be an egalitarian humanist take note of what the feminists were right to criticize combine it with the other side of the issue they might have missed and finish what they started?Because at this point if you are an egalitarian humanism what feminism continues to do is in direct opposition to that ideology.  If youre someone who wants to see equality of course you are going to call out people who actively campaign against equality egalitarian policies and ideals.  If people are pushing to implement policies and pushing an agenda that is sexist of course I am going to oppose that because I dont agree with it.  I can still look at all the things they have done right but Im going to condemn the things theyre doing wrong.As someone who believes in equality on a fundamental level and wants to see it whenever and wherever feasible I am compelled to condemn the actions of anyone who works in direct opposition to this.  Discriminating against someone based on their age sexuality gender race etc. for any reason is antiegalitarian regardless of how justified one may think it is and thus I will oppose it because it is contrary to my own idea of what is right and just.,Documentaries,cw7iozv,6,t5_2qhlh

5497791,0,t1_cweab03,Dont know why youre getting downvoted for asking a good question. I think the answer lies somewhere in the frustration a lot of men feel in regards to their sexlove lives. No matter how successful you are at getting laid you will at some point be frustrated with a lack of success in some capacity. But there is a fine line between becoming successful and unsuccessful and where you stand in relation to that line is precariously dependent on your personal character and outward appearance. If you are not exceptionally attractive andor lack the  social skills necessary to be successful youll probably get more frustrated and quicker. Frustration turns into a lack of motivation because statistically the next time you try to get laidfall in love will be unsuccessful. Regardless of the reason for any lack of success it seems those that are unsuccessful tend to develop a resentment for society that it would place them so low on the social ladder and often resentment for women as well. These are the men of MGTOW and TRP. They are simply fed up with having an insatiable sex drive and desire to be with women but unable to fulfill it. To them being happy means not trying to quantify your worth in the number of women received. In my opinion these men are not so much being subject to any substantial social injustice so much as they are being subject to the brutal honesty of being confined to a biological community in which the ultimate goal of absolutely everything is sexual reproduction.,Documentaries,cwee7zl,-3,t5_2qhlh

When it happens i know what it is and what to expect. I cant move but i know my brain is waking up so I just give it a few moments and let it just kinda happen. Relaxing or trying to relax helps it finish faster... so I just think oh ok sleep paralysis. Just wait until i can  move. Im fairly certain that it has also happened when ive slept in a weird position or on my limbs to cause them to get numb and fall asleep. Obviously this would explain the paralysis entirely but I have had it happen without my handarm going asleep. That said its pretty surreal to be half asleep and trying to will your arm to move then suddenly seeing your fingers and arm flop back in responseIt definitely happens more often if im highly stressed unhappy or sleeping in less than ideal conditions.

The whole wealth culture is about being seen  they want to be seen driving their expensive cars its the same reason why Harrods has the expensive watch section in prime position in the middle of the store the buyers want to be seen spending hundreds of thousands of pounds.They just havent bought around here in Greenwich or Blackheath despite the properties here costing a fortune.

On what possible basis could an individual  from another country  have to lie about what they believe. That is utterly ridiculous and a perfect example of what I am saying  an extremely limited ability to parse logic combined with a psyche hellbent on identifying badies leads to complete morons believing completely bizarre things.Edit I mean you are so removed from reality that you would be completely unaware  and more importantly  uncaring that you actually just directly and personally insulted another individual by labeling them with the worst possible noun  liar. Why? Do you even notice that you dont care?Edit Im sorry I just readgtJust by asking you one simple question I can prove that your belief in the official story is based on nothing but assumptions. As in  years and I challenge everyone to prove me wrong not a single person has been able to provide the evidence that the steel in any of the buildings reached a temperature that would cause it to weaken.Thats it? That is what holds your entire beliefs together? But that is so easy to poke holes in....? Metal expands and weakens with temperature in a relatively linear fashion. It does not begin to weaken at a given high temperature! It progressively weakens with increasing temperature. When a single location eventually reaches the minimum temperaturetime requirement for the metal to have sufficiently warped many thousands of tons push on this location increasing torsional forces until a single loadbearing structure gives way. Those many thousands of tons fall ft  taking out the next floor like it wasnt even there i.e. too much force.Hence all you need is a minimum heat and a minimum time in one location. In this case  without even looking for references  I can have an educated guess that this temperature might have been around  C for hr  depending on the load above.And that was it. Down she came  vertically.Correction I didnt mean to imply a single fire in a single location is capable of causing progressive collapse in a building. The surrounding fires also help with the process described above and that process occurred inside a larger inferno.Now all I expect is venom and vitriol from you from experience but I can hope for goodwill nevertheless.Pleasantly surprised.,Documentaries,cwx2p6o,1,t5_2qhlh

5683567,0,t1_cx1jiin,Believe me when I say I dont mean this facetiously Ok.My response to ukvect made no judgement and took no position. By no means was it an endorsement or for that matter a denunciation of Foucaults argument. It provided a very very rudimentary context for a comment in desperate need of some.  That being said I think your suggestion that Foucaults primary concern was protecting academic freedoms is in short wrong. To be honest Im somewhat unsure where academic freedom comes into this at all so Im not sure how to respond. Please if you can give me some background on where youre getting that from Id really appreciate it. I just scanned Foucaults argument in The Danger of Child Sexuality and this is what I take to be his primary concern In the past laws prohibited a number of acts indeed acts so numerous one was never quite sure what they were but nevertheless it was acts that the law concerned itself with. Certain forms of behavior were condemned. Now what we are defining and therefore what will be found by the intervention of the law the judge and the doctor are dangerous individuals. ... And sexuality will no longer be a kind of behavior hedged in by precise prohibitions but a kind of roaming danger a sort of omnipresent phantom a phantom that will be played out between men and women children and adults and possibly between adults themselves etc.So to parse this his primary concern seems to be surrounding the transformation of a punitive system of laws that prohibits and punishes specific acts  lets say the abuse of children  into a punitive system of laws that circulate around establishing and punishing deviant individuals a sort of identity politics of punishment where someones identity is fixed as lets say a pervert or pedophile established as a threat in perpetuity rather than breaking a law being punished for it and not being marked forever more as dangerous.Furthermore his discussion of children is far more nuanced and indeed seeks to foreground and value the experiences of children than you seem to thinkBut after all listening to a child hearing him speak hearing him explain what his relations actually were with someone adult or not provided one listens with enough sympathy must allow one to establish more or less what degree of violence if any was used or what degree of consent was given. And to assume that a child is incapable of explaining what happened and was incapable of giving his consent are two abuses that are intolerable quite unacceptable ... Again the child may be trusted to say whether or not he was subjected to violenceI would suggest you read the whole transcript but if you dont have time for that read that last line Again the child may be trusted to say whether or not he was subjected to violence. Foucault does NOT say Child abuse doesnt exist he does not say it is a social construct. Instead he is saying we must listen to the individual and if they say an abuse has been committed that and only that is the marker of abuse. Now you may very well not agree with Foucault on this position. But to suggest his position is as facile as protecting academic freedoms is more important than protecting children does a disservice to you and him. TLDR Always read the primary sources Again the child may be trusted to say whether or not he was subjected to violence  Foucault and oh shit I forgot I wasnt on rphilosophy.

5706671,0,t1_cx3tyws,You accuse me of those things but you misunderstood my post probably because it was not written correctly. I meant to personify the typical person in typical society so I guess based on your answer that didnt work.I think that individuals are generally unable to affect what is happening to our planet and also our current ways of organising ourselves collectively are not sufficient like our capitalist freemarket and shortterm political cycles. I also think that because we are animals and are driven by what I said above then in the end the world is just a reflection of that resources are being consumed and pollution emitted because we all want a better lifestyle more wealth more expensive clothes and cars to attract hotter women etc.I think that the above is fine we are what we are and I am not criticising that but I think we need better systems above us individuals to organise ourselves better. For example some say population growth is a problem but our current systems are unable to affect this climate change is a problem but everything is so slow moving that probably we will end up with severe effects from climate change. Maybe we need a world centralised government that control and coordinate this and difficult decisions will be made but they must be obeyed in the name of the long term good.,Documentaries,cx4gv2h,1,t5_2qhlh

I definitely try to put myself in their shoes and gender dysphoria must be awful.But a large part of me still just doesnt understand the point of gender identity. To me Im cisgender because people have called me cisgender or my cisgender identifiers like he pronouns and birth certificate and such. And I havent taken much of an issue with that.My gender identity is simply a state of not caring. I mean I go around calling myself a transwoman and asking for she pronouns and legal recognition but it would honestly just be a hobby or something to add spice to my life. And having a hobby like that would probably be offensive and just appropriating what real ciswomen and transwomen are and go through. Im a cisperson not because Im masculine or feminine or how masculine or how feminine I am but because Im totally okay with my assignment at birth just not with gender roles or stereotypes or my individuality being labeled as masculine or feminine.Do I have a cisgender gender identity if Im not really attached to it and it just feels like it?

5807113,0,t1_cxgndkf,Theres a difference between style and substance. Left leaning sites do use clickbait styling and structure but theyre not overtly lying about facts. In general in todays US politics its very questionable to say Oh the left and the right both do it! Its a false symmetry. The structure of the left and the right voter bases are very different and call for different tactics to maximize voter turnout the left has a large but lethargic base. That calls for a bigtent approach with a lot of reaching out to various groups. This is the kind of behavior that makes Clinton look calculating and poll driven. The left also has a large contingent of very educated white nonreligious urban voters which calls for a rejection of overtly religious motivations and ideas and a lot of leftleaning under voters who do not have an established pattern of voting and who are not motivated by fear or panic but are better motivated by hopeful rhetoric everythingsgoingtobedifferent changetheworld story lines that kind of thing.The right is shrinking older and has a more established habit of voting in both national and local elections. The voter turnout effort there is trying to wring out the last few percent of people. Getting from  turnout to  calls for different tactics than does getting from  to . Wringing out that last few takes panic hyperbolic claims all kinds of unsavory looking tactics. So in US politics if you say Oh the left does it too! almost always youre wrong. The left and right are using wildly different tactics to accomplish very different goals. We should not expect to see the same bad acts on both sides and in fact we do not. There is no industry of inventing falsehoods on the left today. There are other bad acts being perpetrated sure but this tactic is unique to the right in todays politics since it works on the last few percent of voters the right is trying to motivate.,Documentaries,cxgxebx,4,t5_2qhlh

Freaked out I tried to yell or call out and my mouth would open but the following sounds were barely audible despite the strain. I remember crying at that point and only then becoming aware of my surroundings. I was on a spider web and a massive spider was on its way to me. It felt like quite a while before I actually woke but the tears anxiety fear adrenaline and shallow breaths stayed with me and screamed for my mom.

5862312,0,t1_cxnv7cu,Thank you! Moral authority! What I cant get my head around is the disconnect most people have between behavior and moral responsibility. If we are acted upon violently for not accepting unjust conditions  yes that is morally wrong. But it is the behavior itself the violence that is immoral whether it is done to us or by us. It is not about being nice to others but about what the poison that violence is does to our moral selves. Like forgiveness we dont forgive someone for their benefit we forgive as a transformative process within ourselves to let go of the malignancy of anger hate revenge etc. A salient example today is in Israel and Palestine. !Rant alert!One can argue that Israelis can claim a moral right to their own country given the extent and duration of their persecution and one can see that the Palestinians have been thrown out of land they have lived on for many hundreds of generations. Then you see what the status quo of violence against violence does to each group. If the Palestinians protested injustice in a truly non violent way the worlds response to Israeli violence would accomplish infinitely more than what they have with violence. And to see what the violent reaction to their terrorism has done to the IDF. It is excruciating. The over reactive violence of their response is tantamount to Nazi treatment of them in Europe. Violence perpetuates violence. And now we see exposed the historic and current corruption of the police in the USA unjustified murders of black men and a few women planting evidence to put black men in prison the systemic dissolution of the black family and disempowerment and disenfranchisement of the black community  all of which somehow justifies throwing an entire population into the criminal justice system and the continuing racist persecution and hatred. !Conspiracy Alert!How can this possibly not come back to bite us in the ass?

5906443,0,t1_cxtqguv,As far as the numbers go I cant offer any specifics cause I simply dont know them and I doubt anyone anywhere could give you something concrete. However consider the fact that a strike could and often does consist of more than  aircraft more than  weapon. The vast majority of attacks however involve  or  aircraft and no more than  weapons.To further dissect the verbiage used what qualifies a militant versus a civilian? The people identified as part of an organization like the Taliban Al Qaeda Boko Haram Haqqani Network et al ARE civilians i.e. not part of the military from any recognized government. So how do you go about breaking that out? With the full power of the most advanced intelligence apparatus ever assembled... thats how. So we identify and track known militants unofficial definition someone who participates or organizes attacks by nongovernmental agencies... AQ HQN Taliban etc and strike them down to degrade the capabilities of the organizations they are a part of.Now to the locals those same people are often civilians because the deceased arent exactly forthcoming with their affiliations or activities. Or maybe they were actual civilians. Its a question of who you want to believe. I wouldnt tell you that every single person killed by a Hellfire was a militant. Indeed some children have been killed and that is a travesty. But for sure some individuals reported as civilian deaths are likely militant deaths. It really depends on who you ask. So who knows? The numbers are within the believable realm though.     . and some. Definitely within the realm of possibility. The  number seems a bit exaggerated but still POSSIBLE.For a fullblown discussion of effectiveness I cant give you specific numbers to quantify how much more accurate the MQ is than other platforms and the reasons for it but Ill say this... laserguided weapons are more accurate than GPSaided munitions... other aircraft cant stay onstation for the  days prior developing the intelligence required to know youre striking the right target. Drones really are the best weapon we have given the strategic objectives and the situation at hand.Now is this even something we should be involved in? Thats another discussion entirely. Personally I think its an unwinnable situation and we have no end gameexit strategy... but Im still at the tactical end of the spectrum.. working my way to the operationalstrategic side of it.

Patten from the University of Michigan wrote in Human Embryology that the union of the sperm and the ovum initiates the life of a new individual beginning a new individual life history. In the standard college text book Psychology and Life Dr. Floyd L. Ruch wrote At the time of conception two living germ cellsthe sperm from the father and the egg or ovum from the motherunite to produce a new individual. Dr. Herbert Ratner wrote that It is now of unquestionable certainty that a human being comes into existence precisely at the moment when the sperm combines with the egg. This certain knowledge Ratner says comes from the study of genetics. At fertilization all of the genetic characteristics such as the color of the eyes are laid down determinatively. James C. G. Conniff noted the prevalence of the above views in a study published by The New York Times Magazine in which he wrote At that moment conception takes place and scientists generally agree a new life beginssilent secret unknown.,Documentaries,cy0kncn,1,t5_2qhlh

British Airways then went out and did market research and found that the estimates of what the managers thought they were paying compared to what they were actually paying were much much higher.

But I just didnt see enough evidence to be like yeah for sure  these cops killed this chick and framed him. The corpse was found  feet from his home. So whoever killed this chick had to roll up on their property where five people live dump a barrel of remains in his burn pit that he just happened to have been using recently and get out of there without anyone hearing or noticing anything. Then its like how many people even knew this chick would be at Averys location. I mean the police had no reason to know. Im not even sure how they would find out unless they were tapping into phone lines and monitoring every call in the hopes of finding some random stranger being on their property they could kill and frame Avery with. Its just like what are the odds. And its not like a police department has never been sued before. It happens all the time. Its really not the end of the world. Taxpayers bail them out like always for their shoty police work and life moves on. Anyways I just didnt feel convinced. There wasnt enough concrete evidence for me to believe the police were guilty. It was mostly just speculation and bias that I think most people are being swayed by.

6326853,0,t1_cz8q00u,I am glad you found some alternate data.It is true that WHO may have been way off in their report but you have to keep in mind that the WHO is a medical research organization while the Guardian is a news rag. Not really the same level of scrutiny at all. More to the point here are some problems with the Guardian article these are very typical of pretty much all news these days The Guardian misquotes the original WHO report  deaths vs below  which does not inspire confidence in their ability to report on other sources. The guardian does not cite any of the studies it refers to making it very difficult to impossible to fact check their claims. Sloppy or underhanded reporting take your pick. The Guarding makes it sound like International Agency for Research on Cancer disagrees strongly with the WHO and yet the only discrepancy they present is in the estimate of future deaths  vs . A number that is essentially an educated guess not a real statistic. There seems to be no disagreement about the below  figure even according to the Guardian. It does state that there is massive disagreement between Russian sources and the UN  vs . But judging by the fact that the WHO report cites many Russian studies and the fact that the Guardian cant even copy paste the number  I would guess that the real reason is that we are not comparing apples to apples. I am guessing that the Russian sources estimate the total number of victims who are now dead  years after the accident but the Guardian decided not to mention that most of these deaths have been attributed to other primary causes. Notice that the Guardian did not bother to cite the Russian source so it is impossible to show where and how they made a mistake. The numbers that the Guarding claims are coming from Ukraine and Belarus are even more preposterous. If they are true the accident has killed the equivalent of  of each countrys total population. To put  deaths in perspective Pripyat had a total population of  before the accident. Combining the three figures as these deaths supposedly happened in separate countries the total death toll according to Guardians unspecified other sources is over . One would think that the WHO which has been carefully studying the disaster for decades you can see the backlog of reports on their site would have noticed that the equivalent of half the population of Dallas Texas died of radiation poisoning. If there is any truth at all to these numbers there must be a massive worldwide WHO is international coverup going on spanning decades. But my money is on the Guardian reporters intentionally misreading figures so that they can quote big numbers to get views. Controversy sells so it must be created where there is none.So no I dont believe the Guardian and it will take a more reputable or at least competent source for controversy to begin raging over the agendas of the IAEA.TLDR  Be careful what you read in the newspapers.

6357608,0,t1_czbw84p,It used to be geared up for the disabled or rather those partially disabled. There was a nationwide company formed and subsidised by the government called Remploy.Remploy made anything and everything but more importantly they employed people who had little chance of securing a job against a more ablebodied person. They were also more forgiving with regards attendance because disabled folk are likely to attend hospitals or doctors more or even be off work more.Then a new change of government saw Remploy closed down. They claimed that in todays world employers have rules put to them which meant the disabled could not be discriminated against. Yeah right  we all know how employers try as much as possible to find loopholes or simply shun the less abled because theyre not as productive etc.The closure of Remploy combined with the recessions of late has put too many out of work. I know for sure that many less abled would love to work or be able to contribute in some way to society.To many outside the UK it seems like a good country  it isnt. Theres oppression from those such as benefits agencies and government departments too. Man I can ramble on! An example You become unemployed and so attend a Jobcentre theyre a government department and claim out of work benefits and ask for help to find a new job. Firstly you get zero help from them in getting the benefits youre entitled to. They only give them when you know what youre entitled to and demand them there and then! We have to use charitible sources to know our entitlements. Secondly they will refuse job seeking help for  months  a rule they have now. Too many excuses to list. Theyre not a Job finding place for sure..Now I live in an exindustrial part of the UK. The North East close to Newcastle upon Tyne. Im lucky to live here because of the closeness to open countryside but also close to a vibrant small city. Therein lies the problem  were trained in industrial work mostly and to get a similar job wed have to relocate elsewhere. But the UK is undergoing huge change and industry is diminishing to the point that we have almost none now. An easy fix is to retrain but even help with that mostly is vanishing. Im lucky in that Ill get help with retraining such as educational tools for free pc books transport but others dont.More ATOS trick questionsYour hair has been combed therefore you can work.

6361464,0,t1_czcc3wr,My mistake. I should have said the federal government. State government has plenty enough power to regulate all those things except the military. And free market doesnt have shit to do with child labor. And if you think the federal government is doing a good job with public schools then you are a victim of thier indoctrination. We send billions of dollars to the Department of Education they blow most of it and send back ten cents on the dollar. But of course with strings attached. Schools should be run by elected officials who have to run into me at the grocery store and whos children have to go to school with mine. The free market could run the banks just fine. People dont have to be responsible for thier investment decisions because of guess what? Thats right folks. . The federal government. Without government interference people would be careful who they give thier money to. And banks would guard that money with their lives for fear of having to run into those people at the grocery store if they made bad investments. And banks could fail and teach people lessons without taking the whole economy with them. Besides whats wrong with saving your money to get what you want anyway? The next bubble to burst is going to be student loan debacle. Created by what? Thats right folks the federal government. If colleges had to compete on merit college tuition would be a fraction of what it is now. As it stands colleges can offer any bullshit degree in social justice warrioring for hunfreds of thousands of dollars and kids who should have gone to a trade school can now afford them because the bank will loan the money. Guaranteed by the federal government of course so banks dont have to be responsible either. Today the bartender is responsible for the drunk. And its MY fault people of color cant be successful. As soon as you move responsibility for actions away from the individual this is what you get. You can blame a whole lot of things for the way things are but Ayn Rand aint one of them. Remember I told ya anything the Federal government gets involved in will be fucked up.. Anything the Federal government gets involved in will be fucked up. We should have a constitutional amendment that forbids the government from providing any good or service that could equally well be taken care of by the private sector.

My father rushed into the bathroom to pull her out and I had to call the ambulance. I thought she was dead.The next time she had one I was about  or  but this time she was in the kitchen and I was home alone with her before school. This was no question the scariest thing I have ever experienced. Shes had a few more since then although shes lucky her medications mostly keep it in check her seizures not light triggered and seem to be a result of sleep deprivation. Recently her medication has started to show some side effects in the form extremely low levels of sodium and potassium. Her biggest fear has always been having a seizure at work. We had many talks about it when I was in high school and college Im  now and the idea that she might have one at any time at work lose her job over it and have her life somewhat unraveled clearly weighs on her. Only recently has she told people that she has the condition. Some of our closest family friends didnt know until I was in college and these are neighbors and people whose kids I went to high school with. The sense of paranoia the what will people think factor is high because there is not much education about the disorder. All that is to say that Im not sure I can watch this haha.

6406955,0,t1_czhbdjy,Well said. Although your reasoning seems to suggest that pedophilic relationships such as these arent inherently wrong but are wrong simply because they take place in the context of a society which stigmatizes sex. By contrast if this were to take place in a society where sexual acts such as getting a hand job where considered causal pasttimes no different from eating icecream or playing contact sports then there would be no reason to see such acts as particularly naughty or shameful.Eventually technology will progress to a point where all STDs can be vaccinated for and convenient foolproof forms of birth control will exist. At this point sexual activity would pose less physical risk than riding a bike eating junk food etc. In such a case the claim that sex is some special impure naughty andor risky activity will become far less defensible.Also just wondering whyd you create a new account just to reply to my post?,Documentaries,czhwmal,1,t5_2qhlh

6604580,0,t1_d02f9s6,Im really sorry you have a terrible situation. Im my opinion bipolar I requires treatment for a person to be happy and successful. I use those terms loosely as treatment varies and meds effect people differently. But if the person doesnt want treatment everyone else will suffer and in the end so will the person with bipolar.No one should worry about losing out on the benefits of the mania. If I ever want to bat shit insane again I can quit taking my meds. The point especially for your brother is to see where you are when you are a more normal version of yourself. It helps so you can find weaknesses of triggers. It gives you a baseline and your friends and family can weigh in. No one loses their bipolar its always there lurking.Lithium is pretty well known and had been around for a long time. I have heard horror stories but I really dont buy it. I have gone through lithium toxicity and it sucked but even then was not that bad. I caught it quickly. The only noticeable effects I had were at the beginning and lasted a few weeks. It is combined with something else like an anti psychotic. It has been successful with me for a decade. As I get older my bipolar changes but doesnt get worse.,Documentaries,d02gvjd,7,t5_2qhlh

A barbaric inhumane sadistic system in a country were slavery has been kept legal so the inmates can be legally used as slaves and set to do slave labor.    See Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution  gt Section . Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their jurisdiction.    And they got the death penalty btw the passive death penalty. The only way out of prison for them is in a coffin and that is a death penalty one that is much worse than the active death penalty where you are executed. The passive death penalty means you are dumped into a cage not even used for zoo animals and told to sit there until you die whether that is  week from now or  years from now is irrelevant it is decades of mental torture.

6645668,0,t1_d06ltqi,Lions dont have the choice to eat anything else or have the mental capacity to understand the suffering they cause to the animals they eat. Humans have both those things and can live a healthy productive life thanks to modern agriculture and technology without ever eating an animal derived product. As youve mentioned factory farming is an essential part of keeping the animal production process efficient cheap and able to feed our incredibly large population if everyone wants meat as a part of their diet. Factory farming standards include dehorning debeaking chick culling by maceration killing animals at th their potential life span and keeping animals in cramped conditions with no ability to move among many other questionable practises. These are not cherry picked examples of cruelty. If you are not happy with these industry standards then the only logical step that comes to my mind is to remove animal products from your diet. You say your life cannot and will not change. You absolutely can change as many others already have the only unknown here is whether you will or not. I dont mean to insult you by any of this. If youre happy with the factory farming practises Ive mentioned then Im not going to berate you those are just the facts and you can do with them what you want. But lets accept reality here one which no politician or vote or petition is ever going to change Billions of animals not so dissimilar from us ones which feel pain and suffering will only have their suffering ended by individuals you and I deciding to take action for ourselves. ,Documentaries,d06pxfk,4,t5_2qhlh

This is evidenced by Bernie Sanders calling himself a socialist when he clearly doesnt advocate workers control but welfare state.To be clear I definitely do not agree with the word being used in this way. It completely ignore the entire history of the theory and movements behind socialism.,Documentaries,d0cczaa,1,t5_2qhlh

6708575,0,t3_47db02,I feel crappy about making my post about me and my situation but I feel compelled to write something for some reason and sorry for the wall of text.I watched my first death last year in person.   Ive seen many people die on tv or even on Reddit in the WTF subreddit but nothing prepared me for what I witnessed.I watched my father die a horrible prolonged violent death.   The hourlong gasps for air the body convulsing and moreso the helpless looks on the faces of my family as we surrounded my father at the end of his battle with cancer and the end of his life.I see those images every night when I close my eyes.   I hear the sounds and Im transported back to that hospital room on a nightly basis.I was for assisted suicide before my fathers death and watching him SUFFER like he did solidified my belief in allowing someone to humanely end their life.Im sure the video was cut to take out some of the painful moments but what I saw and heard did not remotely sound like what my father and millions of other people go through every day year.I was told before that death is beautiful  that it should be celebrated and not looked at sadly.    I dont feel that way and I dont think I ever will after what I witnessed.The only beautiful thing about it was that he no longer had to suffer.   But apart from that its not pretty and I wish someone had told me before instead of giving me a false impression.,Documentaries,d0d82rl,2,t5_2qhlh

6724571,0,t1_d09qd8y,Think about it like this  The martian core is solidified to a certain extent so it has an extremely weak magnetic field  which is what originally caused its atmosphere to bleed off solar wind is nastyThe venetian core is still very active  which is why it still has a dense atmosphere.  As a matter of fact one layer of the venetian atmosphere is a comfortable  degrees Fahrenheit.  Theoretically we could live there using zeppelin type vehicles and only need supplied breathable air.  Thats with absolutely no terraforming involved.The only way to even attempt to terraform mars would be to bombard it HEAVILY with asteroids brought in from the main asteroid belt.  IF you could impart enough energy to reliquefy the core  it would also completely liquefy the surface and make mars untouchable for millions of years.IF we could scrub large masses of carbon from the atmosphere of venus it would allow more solar radiation to be expelled along with heat back into space.  BECAUSE the surface of venus already has so much energy  even if we were able to alter the atmosphere of venus and create livable conditions were still left with the surface having way to much absorbed energy.  The only way to get around that and actually make the terraforming process feasible within one or two human generations would be to completely scrub the atmosphere of ALL carbon and send venus into a massive ice age.  Once venus is in an ice age it can allow for the surface to bleed off energy at an exponential rate.  HOWEVER  it would be tectonic activity subduction that would take these entire newly formed mountain ranges of carbonic acid to the melting pot within venus.  The surface would literally act as a carbon regulator.  As the carbonic acid is turned back into carbon dioxide the surface of venus would belch regulated amounts of greenhouse gasses back into the atmosphere and begin to rewarm the atmosphere.It is at that point where we would take other steps such as introducing plankton and other flora and fauna in order to maintain a homeostasis that rivals what we have here on earth.  bear in mind carbon isnt the only greenhouse gas in effect  I just really didnt feel like saying ALL of them each time I mentioned it,Documentaries,d0evnog,2,t5_2qhlh

6797736,1,t1_d0mst7x,Its not about being proheroin its about evidence. There is plenty of data showing that people use opiate derivatives casually Or for short term needs and do not become addicted. In all the forms they came in. In addition the vast majority of the ill effects you see from heroin doesnt come from the actual opiate it comes from the impurity within its manufacture due to its illicit sources. Medical grade opiates can be taken with very few long term side effectsin fact the Tylenol tied into most opiates is usually more poisonous than the opiate.Now thats not to say opiates arent dangerous breathing suppressionoverdose is a danger and the range for that is pretty massive and seems to depend a lot on the individual. We also dont know all the negative long term effects but overall? We do know substances like alchohol are clearly more destructive And potentially more addictive. and the effects of PURE opiate derivatives? Has actually very few obvious destructive side effects Many people can live for years on them without any clear physical effects except becoming dependent on the substance. Unlike alchohol which causes dependence and destroys various systems in the bodyOpiates are like anything else. The vast majority of people can use them short term and then give it up. I mean just common sense will tell you that. We have a big opiate pain pill problem in this country right? But think in terms of HOW many people have used those pills Then the people who became addicted seem smaller. Anyone who has had surgery or a major injury almost ALL of them are prescribed opiates as the go to short term analgesic. How many people who have had those procedures end up with half a bottle of used opiates in their cabinet they almost never touch again? Most of the people you know probably. All those people illustrate that many people can use these products and NOT get addicted. Addiction is complicated just like with gambling or alchohol or even computer gamesthe underlying causes are usually not bound to the product but the person. Now that being said opiates do have a dependency factor so they are different from say Gambling...But the point is its pretty obvious the vast majority of people will not become hopeless addicted with just casual use. ,Documentaries,d0mtczn,3,t5_2qhlh

Springfield Musket model of  or a Springfield  was the most common weapon in the first part of the Civil War.  The US Rifle Caliber . Model of  or the  Springfield as it came to be known followed the same pattern as did the M model of  rifle and the M rifle also known as the BAR.The Americans werent the only ones to use this system  look at the German Gewehr  or  gewehr just means rifle in German adopted in  and  respectively.  The ubiquitous Mosin Nagant  is a rifle designed in  and redesigned in  to shorten it so we get the  or the  for a wartime redesign.This however caused some problems when the century rolled over so in the Interbellum the US switched over to a sequential numbering sequence unlike the Russians  the AK was designed in  and the AK in  respectively.  Theyre currently running into the same issue with the AK proposal.  This meant that the US ended up with US Rifle  caliber Model  or the M Garand the US Carbine Model  the M Carbine.  You can see this in tanks we had an M Light Tank as well as an M Medium tank.  It got confusing but its just a nomenclature thing.

The point that some want to avoid is that a hammer attack is usually going to be less deadly than one from a gun.It isnt the gun that causes the violence but the gun does make that violence much easier and more devastating.  Essentially the violence doesnt have anything to do with the gun but the gun is the means of that violence being carried out.TLDR both sides have valid points.  Guns dont cause violence but they do amplify the damage.,Documentaries,d15ypft,1,t5_2qhlh

If she gets to a place in her life where she believes she can actually be a responsible parent she can adopt. Shed be doing better for society to give a home and provide love for an unwanted child. The point is though that I think very very few women would abuse the system in this way and the forms you have to sign probably take away the right to sue if the damage they make you fully aware of being a possibility beforehand occurs. Its like all the fuss Republicans make over voter ID laws for the handful of people that actually abuse that system.

Hes not saying that being transgender is like a disease he clarifiesjust that hormone therapies and sometimes surgery are things people need to live a healthy life.But maybe thats just the view of the university at large.

7133752,0,t1_d1oyy9l,sorry you got downvoted thats one way to look at it. The other is i live in a country most people in the US never heard of in a small city in the middle of nowhere how do I bloody get these guys attention to let me work for them? Throughout the whole documentary no one fucked anything up. Matter of fact respectable companies like google and a few more will actually pay a bounty for anyone who reveals a security flaw or exploit and explains how they did it. These range from a few thousand to upwards of k. Thats how a lot of whitegrey hat hackers make money they forgot to mention that in this documentary. A lot of these companies will even extend offers to these people.I know for a fact if i ran a company who relied on security to protect my clients data and some dude broke what i pay millions to secure i would offer that guy a contract to keep trying and find anything else clearly hes looking at something my guys did not.So if i was a security expert and wanted to work at google i would probably try to find a vulnerability and use that as my application as the competition is insane.,Documentaries,d1p11f3,10,t5_2qhlh

If we have to put cows and chickens down when we stop eating them it isnt because we stopped eating them its because we ate them in the first place. And I fail to see how this is a problem for you you obviously dont think its cruel to kill a sentient being.Lets suppose everyone went vegan over night. What do we do with the  billion animals? Suppose the most effective is to kill them. Ok so we kill  billion animals.Now suppose nobody went vegan overnight. What do we do with the  billion animals? Well we kill them. And then we kill their offspring again next year.You havent thought it through proven by calling the first option worse and all youre giving me are adhoc rationalizations for something you simply cant justify without redefining words we otherwise agree on. You end up having to call killing someone humane or uncruel for example. Its a selective failure of compassion that is natural given the society and systems around agriculture we have created but it is not rational.Life IS a balancing act and we have messed up. We should fess up to it and actually balance life. There is nothing balanced about the animal industry.gt Not eating meat anymore is a solution that results in nothing being gained except worse pain and suffering.Youve no idea what youre talking about and as far as I can tell you just say things to make yourself not have to deal with the fact that your lifestyle causes pain and suffering in the world for countless beings that actually can feel pain and can suffer. You can either admit that or you can fail to admit it because its easier for you. Do you know what adhoc means? It essentially means pulling an argument out of your ass on the spot.

7280801,0,t1_d257xj6,Its true they CAN be that bad.  I really got angry and sad for this guy while watching.  I have Tourettes syndrome.  Its mild now but when I was younger it was far worse.  Trauma especially emotional can have a huge impact on it.  For me I had many tics but primarily with my eyes rolling blinking excessively and other movements.  To this day if I havent smoked it is so difficult to fall asleep because I am laying in bed constantly rolling my eyes or blinking them clearing my throat and other things.  It only makes the situation worse because when youre tired typically your tics get worse...Which is the case with me.  The less sleep I get or the more tired I am say I had a long day at work the more they act up...Its a vicious circle.  I was diagnosed when I was approximately  or  years old.  Back then I am  now almost Tourettes was a known condition but not really researched well and there were a ton of possible solutions with medication.  They were all horrible for me and I found out later that I was actually lucky with some of them...Heres just a few of the possible side effects Sudden Death I believe its Haldol that can cause this maybe Risperadol sp? I gained a fuck ton of weight and was therefore made fun of constantly for that as well as my tics Some made me extremely violent not murderous but rather quick to anger.  ANYTHING could set me off.  I was in daily fights until they took me off that particular medication Some made me sleep even less than what my Tourettes caused so they exasperated the situation even moreso Some made me do nothing BUT sleep Some made me depressed there were medications at the time that are actually also used as antidepressants etcI had a bunch of other issues with medications but those are the ones that spring to mind immediately.  Once I hit  I told my parents whom I cannot blame they were only trying to help and doctors to basically fuck off and quit all medications they wanted me to try.  Nothing had helped really up until that point and if it had it was only a minor improvement that came with a TON of bad side effects.  So there was no risk on my part in doing so.  One day I smoked some weed.  I didnt really feel anything you know the old addage about not feeling high the first time except I noticed that not once for about  hours did I have a single tic.  I never really associated it with Marijuana until I was a lot older and started reading up on the research and studies on the internet.  I can even recall about  years after I started dating my girlfriend her mother would compliment me on how she barely noticed my Tourettes anymore or They have gotten a ton better not realising that I was high on weed at the time she is against Marijuana very old schoolreligious so I would never tell her.  I can honestly say that since I made that decision for myself at  to stop the other medications my life has been so much better.  I put myself through college and although work is slow for me right now the industry I am in I am able to function on  hour work days go home hit a couple bowls and be ready for the next day.  Im a fully functioning adult member of society now.  If I had never made that choice and continued all the pharmaceutical crap they wanted to shove in me I couldnt even begin to picture where I would be at instead.  But it definitely would not be here.  ,Documentaries,d25s1d9,1,t5_2qhlh

7294102,0,t1_d277oub,From a physics standpoint of course. However in the scope of the argument here were talking about people not being able to afford meat in order to live. The premise of my argument is that it doesnt matter what the price of meat is because nonmeat bulk calories eg the corn grain soy that they make the feed out of is cheaper per calorie than meat because it takes say x grain calories to make x meat calories. In the context of poor people needing to afford food if theyre so poor theyre having trouble affording food then theyre not necessarily concerned with the price of meat theyre concerned with the price of bulk calorie grains and vegetables. Added demand for these to use for animal agriculture raises the prices of the foods the poor actually need regardless of the price of meat.,Documentaries,d27age4,2,t5_2qhlh

7331932,0,t1_d1bgkdr,Hey ujkr . I know Im like a month late to this thread but I saw that you were arguing with this other person who wasnt very articulate about abortion and I couldnt help chiming in. Youre definitely on the defensive side of the issue when it comes to reddit and I respect you standing up for your beliefs. And for the record I thought you stood your ground quite admirably.Im really curious about you witnessing abusers of abortion though. To me Im a white american liberal male in my late s btw I have a hard time picturing abortions being something women can easily abuse. From my understanding even if simply given oral medication early in the pregnancy abortion seems like a really brutal procedure. The fetus no mater how early in its development must be disposed from the mothers vagina which sounds very emotional to me. I know your opinion is that these women are somewhat heartless in the first place but I have no doubt that the process must be extremely trying if not heartbreaking. If past the first trimester it must be excruciating. Do you actually know women who have had multiple abortions rather than embracing other forms of BC? Again genuinely curious.Im from southern california and I like to think that the people and women in my life are quite informed and responsible but I am also aware that Im a part of a culture that takes precautions for a sexual culture and might possibly encourage certain alternatives to motherhood. Other parts of the country could be vastly different than the world I know so Im open to learning different perspectives.I do have to admit that I do side with the opinions although heshe stated them quite rudely to your opponent in this thread. I think that there are many cases in which mothers simply arent prepared and that leads to unfortunate upbringings for children. Birth control advocacy is the best solution to this problem but it often fails. Abstinence which I know is hard to admit for many people is an impractical method to ingrain into young people. In modern america where even news anchors rely on sexuality for viewership abstinence is not plausible so there should be better options.I just want to briefly share my perspective from when I was younger. When I was in college I had a few sexual experiences with women that led to some scares. Never going as far as getting a partner pregnant as far as I know but utilizing the option of the plan B pill. To spare the details I had once had a condom turn inside out after completing and to be honest I once had an experience where my partner and I were both hot in the moment and negligent to the consequences. I am an educated and considerate person and so were both of my partners and in both instances we went to the pharmacy the next day and purchased a very expensive plan b pill. And I hope you respond to me with your opinions on that method because Im curious what you would think.But back to the issue you were passionate about in this thread... Is it impossible to imagine that even without a life saving circumstance for the mother that an abortion couldnt be a positive outcome? Its a statistical trend that lower income neighborhoods have higher birthrates and worse childcare in our country. But in order to acknowledge that issue the adversaries of the prolife opinion would have to abandon their ideal America and acknowledge our countrys reality. I personally live in a neighborhood that is mainly Mexican and Catholic. Its no surprise that most of the families in our neighborhood respecting the Catholic teachings against contraceptives have more than  children living in their homes while making less than year. Culturally those neighborhoods have condemned themselves to the trend of early motherhood and an unaffordable family life but our laws also make it harder to break that as a cycle. If an  year old Catholic girl in my neighborhood becomes a mother without her making the decision to do so she simply becomes the next generation of the previous uninformed generation. But the way that the youth in our country stands no  year old is blind enough that they believe they have to settle for a certain lifestyle and they shouldnt. The beauty of the internet of globalization and of the ability to relate to other people despite living thousands of miles away is that there are no limitations for youthful ambition. But at the same time we live in small communities and in this case our entire nation that still have the capability to implement specific laws that make decisions for women. But with those opportunities for young women to be ambitious and seek their full potential the arbitrary nature of the law should not become a boundary that confines her to the opportunities of past. And that is exactly what abortion law then becomes. An arbitrary boundary on the potential for specific women in specific circumstances.Im a relatively young white man who has never felt the detriment of deciding whether or not to abort a fetus. However I have dealt with death. I have felt the pain of losing someone far before they were due. And I know of the suffering that can occur in life and that it can be matched by that of death. With all my heart I believe that no living man can be the decider of whether it is right to contemplate the decision of a mother for the life of her potential child.Laws in our country are unfortunately not designed for specific cases but rather to be guidelines for morality under any potential circumstance relating to hundreds of millions of citizens. Abusers of all laws will no doubtably abuse the law. However the worse abuse comes from those who deny the protection of the law because of the potential for abuse and nothing else.I guess my final sentiment lies in this hypothetical that is obviously not just a hypothetical but a reality for thousands of young women. Should that  year old pregnant girl from my neighborhood be given the opportunity to learn and possibly grow from her experience of going through aborting her first child? Or should she be forced to learn from the irrevocable choices she made leading to motherhood?Again hoping for some constructive criticism with my argument from the opposite perspective.

Shanghai is massive.Anyway I lived near metro stations and what I loved to do is to look at the Shanghai map find an area that looks funny and simply go there. Im not sure what youre in to but you can find interesting stuff on Smartshanghai.com and walking from one random tram stop to another will get you past some crazy places. Personally I loved Hollandtown Ditch Quanzai because Im Dutch as well as Fuxing Island because if you follow the road around you get past industrial parts boats which have been run ashore and converted to houses a nice park and an industrial storage center turned into fashion district with a very nice open square on the Yangtzeside and I liked Hongkou because the broad avenues of the old EnglishAmerican concessions.

Essentially youre making the appeal that our unchecked growth is unsustainable that our growth will outpace availability of resources.  The thing is boyo its not capitalism fueling the expansion its simply our nature.  We fuck like rabbits.  Either we will come up with new technologies and expand into new frontiers or we will die.  Heres a hint so far weve been pretty good at not dying.  But for the sake of argument lets say frontiers and tech arent options as you seem to suggest.  Ending capitalism isnt the answer preventing population growth is.  You want to save the rainforest?  Statemandated sterilization of  of the GLOBAL population is the only way.  Or I suppose we could switch to an economic system in which people starve but that seems much less humane.  Regardless we are supported by resources.

I wish theyd realize how wrong they are and understand that either their tax money is going to act as corporate welfare for international corporations the real dangerous immigrants that we should be building walls to keep out and pointless wars were all lied into or human welfare spent on americans. The tax money will either disappear to places like Saudi Arabia where the feds and american military literally arm fund and provide military training to violent muslim fundamentalist headchopper regimes whose  cultural export is terrorism and violent islamic radicalism or it will stay in America where it belongsbut unfortunately people have been brainwashed into calling this socialism. Theres a near infinite sum of it and right now its spent on harming our country by a criminal subversive antidemocratic force that has pulled off an antidemocratic revolution in our country  where they now pass the highest offices  and appointments back and forth to each other and their own wivessonsbusiness partnerscampaign donors and family friends which is what Trump is to both the Bush and Clinton families in almost every election for decades while enacting laws that strip Americans of their basic legal protections creating massive secret police forcesfederal militant groups domestically to hurt protesterssquash civil disobediencekidnap whistleblowers and overall running the economy into the ground while half of Americans cant even make more than yr.trillions of dollars enter a black hole called defense which really isnt about defense and they cant even provide a good or winning offense either. as we have seen repeatedly they just waste human life and weaken the american military while giving themselves and their corporations limitless money  and they do it for years or decades until people in America stop cooperating and the rich have to worry about the poor biting their hands  and no one says shit because just like in the USSR dissidents are called crazy and those who expose corruption are kidnapped by secret police or regular police like Adrian Schoolcraft and sent to mental institutions or exiled or caged for life.We have the potential to be the richest country on Earth with shared wealth like Norway but instead our country is in a dire situation that nobody seems to be aware of  a lot like the North Koreans arent aware of their dire situation politically because theyre misled from early ages and taught to love their subjugation theyll literally fight against people trying to tell them the truth and they want to believe in all the good things they hear about their leaders who also pass the highest offices between father and son and family friends and their country.,Documentaries,d37ki2l,2,t5_2qhlh

That alerts occupants to vacate the building before the real ordinance hits.  In war its completely unnecessary and its obviously done to protect innocent life.  If youre being intellectually honest it certainly seems like Israel values Palestinian life.  Its a shame that Hamas will shell from school yards and civilian buildings but its calculated for the news reports to make Israel seem like the bad guy.  You can see roof knocking in action here  Speaking of Hamas their charter calls for the elimination of Israel in place of an Islamic State.

I was willing to pay the monthly fee for the standalone HBOnow service which I believe is month but they give you a free  day trial when you sign up so that might be an option for you if you havent watched Only the Dead yet. Just make sure to cancel before the  days are up otherwise your card will be charged after trial period expires creditdebit card info is required at time of signup amp only charged AFTER  days are up if not canceled. HBOnow is available as a mobile app amp probably on most other streaming devices game consoles etc. Wares doc was much different than all the other IraqAfghanistan conflict documentaries Ive seen amp definitely affected me most profoundly one that wont soon be forgotten.

7836815,0,t1_d3wmdjy,Gambling alcohol gasoline cigarettes cars and many others are taxed at higher rates why should marijuana be any different? If Im buying weed I dont mind if some of the money goes to funding my local school or FD or PD. As for the continuance of the black market that is absolutely not true. The only reason why the black market existed in the first place was . lack of options and . an enormous price premium  both of which are solved through legalization. If the risk youre taking by selling weed is extended prison time of course youll charge a high price but when the risk is that the cops are just gonna dump your product down the toilet no one will accept paying  for an eighth when they can go to their local dispensary and get it for  and eighth while also having a wide selection to choose from. The current black market for weed is puny negligible. Virtually no one gets their weed from some shady Latino dude getting a shipment in on Thursday mang. In DC where its legal but no dispensaries have been set up most people just grow it themselves which is legal or get a shipment in from CO or WA while the shipment is illegal the purchase is not. My point is no one is going to enter the black market for weed when the profit margin  i.e the amount of money worth going to prison for  is as that low.

To say Its not a good engineering decision is a massive generalization.  of people? Please you and I both know this is a random number taken out of your ass. If youre going to address a technical topic please stick to proper usage of information.As for heat run any thermal monitoring program hwmonitor etc. and watch the temps. Theyre constantly within the ss ss while idling. You can find some good Macs that have lower temps but they are the ones that won out on the silicon lottery which means it has nothing to do with Apple having built a specifically better laptop rather Intel having built a betterthanaverage CPU. While this is well within operational limits which mean you wont have snoticable thermal problems overtime this wears down the silicon and internal components. Long story short you think the cooling is adequate but if youre looking for something that will last you sometime it wont. This isnt just Mac its the curse of BGA CPUs.Theres a reason why every technical IT guy I know prefers PCs over Macs and NonBGA PCs over anything else. But like you said to each his own. As long as soldered buyers know what theyre getting all power to em.Biggest advantage of socket as well is if anything happens to the CPU go on Amazon buy a new processor install profit! If your soldered CPU fails you have to pay a chunk of premium to have the whole thing replaced.,Documentaries,d3x88ra,2,t5_2qhlh

7995981,0,t1_d4eryb4,gt Yes but what is the ratio between the false rumors and the negative things that are simply true? Is it worth it to remove all negative things about a person regardless of validity in the name of curbing the few false things? In my opinion it isnt.This isnt just talking about political candidates though. They do this for everyone. Have you ever been at the end of a damaging rumor? Would you want Google propagating that rumor by suggesting it every time someone searches your name?Imagine that this isnt Hilary Clinton this is about Jon Doe who worked at Kansas City Water. Jon had a rough breakup with his exSO and then got laid off in the middle of an unrelated company scandal. Now Jons exSO is really pissed at Jon so they go and hire a company to tie the term embezzlement to his name and workplace in Google. There are companies who do negative SEO and Im sure there would be a market for this.Now when Jon is looking for a job and a hiring manager searches Jons name theyll see embezzlement search the full term and get articles regarding the scandal at Kansas City Water. Now its doubtful theyd find any proof that he was involved in the scandal because he wasnt but the fact that it showed up in Google autocomplete would be enough to cause the hiring manager to go on to the next resume. How long do you think it would take for Jon to find out why no one has called him back for an interview? Weeks? Months? All because of a rumor that was not just false but maliciously planted.You may think thats an absurd story but it isnt that unreal. There are a lot of negative SEO companies out there that charge a pretty penny to force your competition out of Google entirely. Now imagine if they had a way to plant a rumor about your company that showed up before you even finished typing the name.Imagine if it wasnt even planted what if you shared an uncommon name with someone who was arrested for a serious crime. If none of the articles have a picture how would a hiring manager know if it was you? How much time do you think theyre going to put into finding out if the story is about you or not?These are all questions Google asked and they chose to strike negative suggestions from the results so that it wont hurt some random person and that they wont be at a legal risk. Its not removing negative things its removing negative suggestions. If you search Hilary Clinton Benghazi youre going to get results. People who are doing research on the candidates arent going to need Google autocomplete to give them suggestions.I also think youre vastly underestimating this ratio of yours. The number of rumors is almost always going to be greater than the number of truths because rumors dont need a source and truths do. Remember there have been Republicans who have accused Michele Obama of being transgender and Obama of being a satanist. Donald Trumps entire campaign has been centered around baseless rumors about other candidates. He quoted a tabloid accusing Ted Cruzs father of being associated with Lee Harvey Oswald. Trump has attacked individual reporters and other private citizens during his campaign. Should every baseless claim he makes be valued as a potential search query? A few false things doesnt cut it when youre talking about the number of rumors that the entire internet comes up with.Yes. It is absolutely worth cutting out a few already widely known suggestions so that the mountains of rumors on the internet dont come tumbling down onto some little guy.,Documentaries,d4etonb,3,t5_2qhlh

8082226,0,t1_d4ohe8q,Thank you for the lexit link. I think there are genuine concerns with appointments to banking and the commission.However that campaign seems to be run by the socialist workers party and the communists and frankly seems to be paranoid. For example The EU originated in a Cold War bloc to rebuild monopoly capitalism in western Europe and confront the Soviet Union and the new states of eastern Europe.Peace was kept in Europe by antiwar feeling in the West and the Soviet policy of peaceful coexistence despite the USled arms race. The GermanSoviet process of detente led to the formation of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe in  which played a leading role in easing tensions although the EU still strives to marginalise the OSCE and its work for peacekeeping arms control democracy and human rights.This just lacks reality.It does explain Corbyns lukewarm backing of remain though.  Hes not the leader to take the left forward.Personally despite the faults of the EU we are massively better if being at the table and having our say rather than sitting in the corner and handing over power to Johnson and Farage to sell off workers and the NHS. We have to work with the EU whatever. I imagine very soon people will be saying it is unfair that we cant influence the EU trade deals and that they are a cabal.

But for another person who believes that an abortion cuts short an innocent persons life they would feel frustrated or angry at the thought of allowing abortions... Thats why this tricky issue.  I am pro life BUT I also am a huge supporter of sex education and birth control. Because you cant push your religious views on other people and its unreasonable to expect people to never have premarital sex. I also think the people who have  kids because birth control is evil are sick in the head. Sex is a part of life we should be educated in it and provided safe preventative methods to control pregnancy. And in the case that an unwanted pregnancies happens programs should be in place to give the child a fare start in life. Abortions for reasons of rape and certain medical circumstances should be available as well.

Today of course the European strategy has changed and they simply invite their ideological adversaries in.Theyre also not the economic necessity that articles like this claimdeveloped economies are not dependent on a glut of unskilled uneducated labor.  Japan and South Korea will care for their people with technology not migrants who hate their guts.The costs associated with the migration are immense and the payoff will be extremely meager given their culture and ideology.

Not that this justifies anything but this girl was an awful person. Not just to my friend and I but to our class as a whole. She had a reputation as the class bully pervious to the incident she bullied  kids out of our school. You either hated or were scared of this girl. The naked picture was sent to my friend from some other guy and my friend is the one who came up with the plan. He made the fake account added her friends and did it all but initially post the picture. We were all on a video chat like Skype oovoo and no one wanted to post it. Thinking I clearly had the biggest balls smallest brain posted it. I felt immediate regret and remorse and took it down and attempted to delete the account. It was too late my friend posted it several more times before I could get the page down.

8307079,0,t1_d5fvn00,Hyper focusing on the types of crimes is misleading at best amp heniously disingenuous at worst. The policing practices of the last  years created the conditions in minority communities today. The War on drugs has taken more lives than its ever saved because its destroyed generations of stability by economicly crippling individuals that would otherwise most likely be productive members of society.....  White people in the US commit the vast majority of all crimes violent amp petty but police officers hyper focus on petty crimes in minority communities amp these petty crimes are in turn punished more harshly when taken to trial. All of this petty over policementpunishment only leads to absent fathers economically castrated men delinquent children etc..... Of course youll retort well what came first the chicken or the egg?Ill tell you just take a look at what the prescription drugs epidemic is doing specifically to the middle class white community.... Otherwise capable amp tax paying individuals are becoming mirror images of Crack addicts from minority neighborhoods in the ss but the police response is to be understanding amp not to increase petty crime enforcement in an attempt to thwart drug crime. This is having positive results in the middle class white neighborhoods in contrast to what happened in the minority neighborhoods. There were a lot of mistakes made in governing minorities amp those mistakes are directly responsible for the current state of affairs. We will never resolve the issues so long as we refuse to see a problem even in the face of evidence.TLDR the type policing being done perpetuates the  mistrust of the police amp the societal issues. ,Documentaries,d5fxwjb,1,t5_2qhlh

Acid and mushrooms arent some miracle drug in fact they have a tendency to bring out your demons rather than fix them. However bringing out your demons can sometimes allow you to confront and fix them. On the same side those demons coming out can just straight up cause you to be crazy example? I had a friend start babbling about the meaning of the universe and she kept getting worse and worse until she locked herself in a room and chopped all her hair off. Another time she ran off from a concert and ended up cuddling with a homeless guy. Moral of the story is dont believe everything you read on the internet or hear people say acid is just what it is a drug.

8453251,0,t3_4vgkmb,In brief this documentary is about an alleged rape in  where the frat boys videotaped the event. The raw uncensored hour long tape was not considered rape by the initial investigators. Personally having watch the documentary I dont think she was raped I think there were several moments where it was obvious that she was a dirty trashy drunk slut egging guys on to fuck her. Plus she was a yearold married women who worked as a stripper and was hired for a frat party by college kids ages . I dont think it was rape. However there were a few parts with it does look like she is resisting and not just play fighting like in some other scenes. Also there are several things the frat guy they interviewed said he did not do that the tape shows he did do. Those scenes and they lies are the only evidence of rape but there is too much evidence it was not rape.The two things that makes this case interesting is. This accuservictim was arrested for crimes she committed in the tape.. The court judged that the tape did not contain criminal content and was the property of the frat boys and ordered the tape released to public domain. This is a tape of at the least a trashy slutty drunk stripper having hours of sex with a frat boy and his friend and at worse a rape video.This is the IMDB DescriptionA documentary about the circumstances during a party at a University of Florida fraternity that led up to what may or may not have been a rape. Interspersed with actual footage shot by the fraternity brothers on the night of the incident including the sexual acts. This video led to the police not pressing charges and the involvement of NOW and eventually led to the fraternity getting kicked off campus.  Here is an article talking about the aftermath of this eventKing requested victim status from State Attorney Rod Smith which would have prevented the video from being released. But Smith would not give King victim status so she went to court. On May  Judge Chester B. Chance said the tape should be released saying Nothing contained in these tapes would cause this court to name her as a victim. After this Smiths office handed out copies of the tape free to the press and others who requested it. A few days later Chief Assistant State Attorney Bill Cervone complained to the Gainesville Sun There are legions of requests...its time consuming. I invite discussion but here is my main question.WHERE CAN I GET A COPY OF THE RAW UNCENSERED  HOUR TAPE?This tape was released to  news stations and was apparently sold for . on the street for years after the event. It is still listed as public domain so it is legal to acquire the tape. I ask for two reasons. . The collected  minus of the tape I saw on the documentary I though was hot as hell. This woman is not a porn star but she is a hot slutty girl. And the sex was pretty hard core and looked like hate sex or come f my desperate sex. . from what I saw it was not enough to tell one way or the other with regards to rape or consensual. If I could see the whole hour tape it might be more clear. So I want to see the whole tape for intellectual debate and personal pornographic pleasure. So does anyone know where I can get the raw uncensored hour tape?,Documentaries,d5y6xam,1,t5_2qhlh

8757445,0,t1_d70bfsy,I guess I just take into context that the argument against the Iraq war lost.  There was a big effort for it too.  People act like there wasnt a debate going into it but there was.  It just lost. I feel like the sentiment from the s is what allowed for that to occur. Even if the polling wasnt high through out the s there was a very popular sentiment that most Americans thought about the Gulf War.  That sentiment being that we didnt finish the job.I pretty much agree with everything you said.  But I have my own take on it.  I grew up in a United States where I on a regular basis saw people talking on the news and in general conversation that wed be back in Iraq at some point.  It was an inevitable conclusion I remember people having made up in their minds before . was just the catalyst that unleashed all the dumb ideas people had about Iraq pre.On polls I think this one is what im thinking of. A Gallup poll made on behalf of CNN and USA Today concluded that  of Americans thought the Iraq War was justified with or without conclusive evidence of illegal weapons.  thought weapons were needed to justify the war.There was a lot of polling going on back then about the war and in the intervening years.  When I talk about things on reddit I almost always do so from my memory so I can see if how I remember things was accurate.  I remember a lot of frothing at the mouth.

8785416,0,t1_d73l4v9,My point was that the iPhone wasnt anything never done before as you originally claimed that google had no idea what a smartphone looked like before Apple showed them when in fact at first they were just trying to compete with the big guys at the time which was BlackBerry Apple wasnt the first to think about putting a massive screen and a touchscreen on a phone what they claimed at the time was that they just took away the stylus because noone likes it everything else about the  original iPhone was done before in other smartphones even the no stylus part with the LG Prada. The one point in their favor is that as far as I know I could be wrong the original iPhone was the first smartphone to support multi touch but there were already devices that had that just not in a smartphone form factor and the idea itself was very very old.Also the original iPhone missed a lot of the functionality of what we consider today a smartphone  it didnt even have an app store as far as I know that came with the iPhone G in  and that also wasnt an innovation there were app stores before but they were mostly made by rd parties. What Apple did was make the whole process easier and better organised because their closed system allowed it.Edit Where I would give credit to Apple is their advertising when the iPhone was announced even I who was  at the time and lived very far away of the US in Eastern Europe knew and was hyped about it its possible that without their advertising the smartphone would have taken longer to enter the mainstream or it would have never happened.,Documentaries,d73ulny,1,t5_2qhlh

8827736,1,t1_d78uphn,Deep Breath. Alright time for some honest criticisms of this because a lot needs to be said as this guy should never be emulated. Ever.It wasnt murder. That isnt just hyperbole its literally libel. I understand you like a lot of people feel very emotional about this but that is a gross mischaracterization. The charges they were pressing on him were a lot but his suicide owed more to his existing mental problems. The failing was not getting him into medical care as soon as they realized he was suicidal as his lawyer had brought it up as an attempt to get charges dropped only white people use how the charges will effect them as mitigating circumstances ridiculous  i say this as a normallevel racist white guy. Had the case hadnt been brought to completion who knows what he wouldve ultimately even ended up truly facing he didnt even know. He had a lot of options open to him. Yea it was unfair but thats life and he honestly had no one to blame but himself. His actions amounted to a protest and he knew what he was getting himself into or should have. You dont do this if you cannot handle the consequences. I do not believe he was simply naive as you said he was brilliant. Lets stop making him into a martyr though. Far more poor black dudes have gotten shafted worse than him with these tactics and how many of you honestly cared this much? Im sure you agree just as earnestly its wrong but did you feel like they were being driven to suicide? Is that ever how you conceptualized it then. Also he was being kind of silly. His actions were meant to provoke some reaction so its really on him that he was facing this. It was not necessary at all. There were a lot of other avenues to take to get what he wanted to achieved done that didnt involve anything remotely illegal. No one was in danger. There was no urgency at all. Had he cared he wouldve lobbied for the laws to allow for papers funded by the public to be freely available. He wasnt going to solve that by doing this. All future papers would have to then be acquired by him again each time they are released. It wasnt a realistic or necessary solution at all. Also who was he really doing this for? The majority of people who can even understand how to read papers like these properly likely have access. If you have no academic background in this youre probably a narcissist if you think you are being denied knowledge because of this those who know know they know  I know I dont.  Ask yourself earnestly if you can assess bad practices  just in case  having read about someone else criticizing some papers for bad practices does not make you mean you are capable of that btw. It means you may recognize one particular bad practice. Im not saying Aaron couldnt Im just speaking to the need for such an action.  This seems a lot more like selfimportant childish desire. I get hes dead now and he got shafted but what he did was not at all commendable and he couldnt even stand strong in face of the harsh consequences which presented an opportunity to give voice to his cause. I do not respect his at all concerning this. Its a shame he killed himself really. He seemed brilliant and troubled. He didnt deserve to die over it and I dont think he even deserved prison time. He was not murdered because he foolishly got in way over his head over some nonsense. This is really unfair to those prosecutors. They werent doing anything out of the ordinary. We might not like it but theyre just doing what we let them do. Lastly if you are going to protest be comfortable with harsh consequences. Dont be naive and think you wont be the one they try to make an example of. ,Documentaries,d78yz0r,-34,t5_2qhlh

Because a lot of kids never get adopted and not all mothers can afford to take care of children.

The depraved economic conditions in these countries have everything to do with US led economic policy in the region.

In thiscommentary a different view is presented by nonUSbased physicians and representatives of general medical associations and societies for pediatrics pediatric surgery and pediatric urology inNorthern Europe. To these authors only  of the arguments putforward by the American Academy of Pediatrics has some theoretical relevance in relation to infant male circumcision namely thepossible protection against urinary tract infections in infant boyswhich can easily be treated with antibiotics without tissue loss. Theother claimed health benefits including protection against HIVAIDSgenital herpes genital warts and penile cancer are questionableweak and likely to have little public health relevance in a Westerncontext and they do not represent compelling reasons for surgerybefore boys are old enough to decide for themselves.,Documentaries,d7vmutv,6,t5_2qhlh

That is because our specific life experiences havent made us susceptible to devout codependency and manipulation in these forms.What Im saying is have a little empathy for things you dontcant understand dude.

The definition used in  when that report was released only included rapes that were commited by force against women and excluded statutory rape and other forms of sexual assault.  That definition has since been updated to include acts of rape that involve nonpenile penetration of either men or women and was also expanded to include cases where the victim was mentally or physicaly incapacitated.  So in  if someone like Audrie had reported her rapist to the police her case might have been considered unfounded or at the very least classified as sexual assault  other or some such bullshit. ,Documentaries,d83jtgy,16,t5_2qhlh

Im not deluded into thinking false accusations never happen but I think it is important to understand context behind the stats we do have.I also havent seen any comments claiming that false rape accusations never happen only that their occurrence pales in comparison to unreported and reported but woefully acted upon rapes.High profile cases like Rolling Stone and Duke were tragedies because they ruined peoples lives but also because they provide fodder for people to claim that women have the upper hand in rape theyre usually lying because they regret the sex etc etc. They also discourage real victims from coming forward for fear of being accused of lying. Its terrible all around. What really bugs me is that the false report rate for other crimes also exist and yet that doesnt seem to invalidate a victims claim of burglary immediately. gtFor example the Portland Oregon police department examined  complaints of completed or attempted sexual assaults in  and found that . were determined to be false. This was in comparison with a rate of . for false reports of stolen vehicles Oregon Attorney Generals Office .,Documentaries,d86lh9z,1,t5_2qhlh

But when the aboriginals migrated to Australia homo sapiens had well and truly developed.

9336493,0,t1_d8zgcnh,You are at war with Russia. If you havent realised that so far I pity you.More so now than during Vietnam or Korea which were the focal points of the Cold War. The only reason the average American can be clueless on this matter is because the US has had such an upper hand over Russia for the last  decades that the US has the ability to economically cripple Russia which it couldnt against the SSSR and no Reagan didnt bankrupt them they did that themselves which they did unilaterally even if major European allies werent on the same gameplan. The currently has such a huge upperhand on Russia that Russia is forced to deploy its own forces to fight US proxies instead of proxy on proxy or the polar opposite that happened in Vietnam even though the North turned out not to be a proxy and were a legitimate player just using the Russians and the PRC.The atmosphere in Russia is a stark contrast. Russians felt threatened by the West since countries like Poland and Czechia joined the EUNATO. From a strategic waypoint this forced Russias hand to play Ukraine and Georgia the way it did. Not that they didnt want to play those cards anyway but after the accessions they had no choice. Pigeoned. After Ukraine many believe Euromaidan was an ebil Western conspiracy though of course it is standard geopolitics that all sides play and a final declaration against Russia. The reporting Sputnik mostly .RT less so but still has been preparing the Russians for this for a long time while Western media try to brush it off to not stir their public support pot. The people wont be against it if they arent aware of it. Meanwhile ask a guy on the street in Moscow and he will tell you that the separatists in Ukraine are fighting Americans. He is more right than the constation that Russia and US arent at war. They are it is simply a worse version of the Cold War rather than the invasion of Iraq. Lots of complications but in the end the US has bombed SAA targets that had at least Russian advisors if not combat personnel. Accident? Yeah right. Prepare for more. Generally if you are interested in the topic I would recommend watching Caspian Report on youtube on the topic. He is pretty knowledgable and tries to be objetive.

And if they do well your life was ruined anyways. In my country the absolute maximum time you can serve in jail is  years.

I demand a doctor check her for abuse as she was at that time only . But every single organisation i approached refused to do anything as she was under children services and they refused to fight them.Now at  and free from childs services she is a mess as she was moved from one family to another being abused regularly by other foster kids and by some of those that were supposed to be looking after her. She was raped multiple times by those adults and others and is very suicidal right now.Sadly she moved away from the area and i do not have contact with her right now but i have a letter from childrens services saying she was not molested in any way after they investigated and one day she will be able to use that in a court case against them she knows about it and has said when she is strong enough she will use it.,Documentaries,d95mcem,2,t5_2qhlh

I dont argue The US is powerful...therefore I believe lots of conspiracy theories. And I dont criticize people for disbelieving one conspiracy theory or conspiracies in general.

Franklin County ya know Moonshine Capital  I have lived in this area the majority of my life and never would feel at home anywhere else. I lived in Chicago for a year when I was  and while it was a very interesting a fun mostly experience I would never ever live there or a place like it.And I think it is a terrible misconception that we are racist country hillbillies rednecks whatever but it is simply not true. In my experience it is no more so than in other places I have ever been. More to the point it is probably less so simply due to the fact that everyone is so nice usually and may have certain feelings but dont really reflect those with various interactions. I mean you will find that a lot of the African Americans around here are just as redneck hillbilly as all the rest of us. The most animosity I have seen as you have said is towards outsiders. Although that is just a wariness that is merely transient as if a person stays long enough they quickly become just as accepted.

Semiautomatic is used bc it would be dangerous and ineffective to fire auto.  PDWs generally arent necessarily designed for close quarters as much as they are designed for special missions.  The P was specifically designed for tank crews to provide them firepower in a package that fit easily in the tank.  Other than the Secret Service I dont know of any organization that widely fields either the P or the Vector.  The Vector definitely opens up the potential for changing doctrine but thats pretty much a unicorn gun for the time being.,Documentaries,d9y5vu4,1,t5_2qhlh

9641207,0,t1_da12cno,The patriarchy  toxic masculinity.  Men are seen as better than women and gay men are seen as closer to being women and gay women as closer to being men.  So it only takes a guy dating another guy once to have him seen as lesser but a woman dating another woman for years will be seen as not really better.  Sexism homophobia and transphobia are deeply intertwined.  This is also why masculinity is so fragile men wont do things they think only women should do whereas women dont mind doing things they think only men should do.  This is why e.g. women can have mens names Ashley Beverley Dana etc at which point they become womens names but not vice versa.  The same goes for clothing.Then theres phallocentrism and how straight guys tend to think everyone else is there for their benefit so they think bizarre things like if it doesnt involve a penis it cant be real sex.  So they think lesbians dont have real sex we do.  Again a guy does anything remotely gay and is seen as irrevocably gay whereas lesbians have to constantly prove ourselves as such.Basically the patriarchy makes things bad for men especially less gender role conforming ones as well as women which is why pretty much everyone should be against it.As things are starting to improve bit by bit at least they were before Trump became president of the US eventually we should start to see things even out a bit more and e.g. two straight men kissing to impress a yaoi fangirl just as often as two straight women kiss to impress a yuri fanboy men adopting womens names and clothes as acceptable for themselves the female gaze in the media and so on.,Documentaries,da1h6wg,1,t5_2qhlh

Teslas problem is that state laws in most states including mine require car manufactures to sell their cars to rd party car dealerships which in turn raises the price of their cars as dealerships sell them marked up and for a profit. Tesla says screw the middle man lets sell to consumers directly from the manufacturer.

Also special relativity pops out at the same time if you do the maths right.Thats actually why its electromagnetism because theyre the same thing the magnetic field is not a separate field from the electrostatic field.And the equations are just the normal Maxwells equations except the equation that relates the magnetic field to the electric field is the definition of the magnetic field thats what it is thats all it is.,Documentaries,da935ei,1,t5_2qhlh

Her books are often placed in the philosophy section at national bookstores well Barnes and Noble is the only one left now and having just left one I think their clock is ticking amongst the works of actual philosophers like Popper Wittgenstein Hume Kant and so forth. And Im not hating on this merely because I disagree with her weak and simple arguments which of course most folks with a degree from a respectable school in philosophy do but rather because she is simply and objectively a word and concept she thoroughly sullied via her hugely disproportionate and hilariouslyinfuriatingly supercilious addition of ism to the word in service of a label to her ideas is NOT a philosopher. Her works in aggregate are by no means representative of a complete philosophy as are those of all the aforesaid philosophers and most other thinkers who having earned the title we now regard as philosophers stretching back to Plato. Rather Rand was simply popular fiction writer who borrowed some very fundamental concepts and terms from academic philosophylogic first year university level stuff hell first classfirst month in college level stuff really in order to erect the flimsy and often desultory facade of intellectual rigor that one encounters throughout all of her writings.Her works should be the fiction or at best politics sections of bookstores putting them in the philosophy section is demeaning to so many of the the greatest thinkers humanity has yielded and insulting to the entire field itself. One can only hope that interest in Rands work might spark a progression to more serious and substantive thinkers in those that encounter it but shamefully it appears that her work is usually the beginning and end of ones forays into philosophy.

Whats preventing the candidates from buying their votes from the electors besides the obvious illegalities of that type of action. You could cover it up pretty well if you were careful. This is why I believe that laws should be enacted to compel electors to side with the popular vote of their state before something like this happens. I really think you overestimate the action the people would take even if there was obvious corruption going on.

Just imagine what scientific progress were lost in his papers that burned in his laboratory fire in Colorado.  The United States government confiscated all of his research papers after his death in . Reportedly Tesla had developed technologies to influence weather patterns at will render physical objects invisible and time travel. Research of great interest to the military. Edisons actions taken to discredit and ruin Teslas AC system vs Edisons DC system are those of a fierce rival and competitor. Not too dissimilar from the format wars in the modern era such as OS X vs Windows BetaMax vs VHS BluRay vs HDDVD etc. Commanding the future of an industry standard is equivalent to corporate warfare. Perhaps it may be unfair to entirely discredit Edisons contributions to the scientific community and the comfort of man. Imagine a world without the ability to record and play back sound contributions to motion pictures and the incandacent light bulb. But as this documentary illustrates Edison grossly mishandled Teslas genius and instead of coddling and nurturing the mans ideas tried to beat him into submission.

Why would you quit doing something you crave something you feel compelled to do more than anything else when you havent suffered any real consequences? Does it happen? Yes. Often? Not at all.Perhaps this comes down to a disagreement between the definition of heavy drinker and alcoholic. Everything in an alcoholics brain tells them that drinking is the most important thing there is. We rationalize it. We obsess about it. Its what our brains tell us we need to get through the day and feel good. Why would anyone stop doing that if they saw their life as functional? Could it happen? Sure.

As long  as we wont carry implants in our stomach monitoring the effect of food  on health all we can do is speculate. For instance omega . Some think linseed oil is all you need because its rich in omega . But some think plants sourced omega  pass right through your body and only fish or free range beefgame will be assimilated.Same with nutrients. Because of  phytic acids If not prepared correctly  aka soaked for hrs min legumes wont give you enough nutrients despite beeing theorically very rich.Everybody eating meat should have killed an animal once to realize what eating a live beeing means even a rabbit takes a toll seriously.But as long as I think animal fat and protein outweighs its vegan counterparts Ill keep eating those. ,Documentaries,db4ad4a,0,t5_2qhlh

That a FWFWFWFWFW Funniest VIDEO EVER from Grandma viewcount should be compared to a any documentary viewcount? I know you are being serious so let me help explain it for you.. You and I probably both consume a lot of quality television. Lots of that being documentaries such as this  one which shine light on an extremely dark corner of our society. How many of those a day do you watch? A week? A month? Maybe  a week if youre a doc fiend like I was in a college. Maybe now its closer to  a month because like me college may have been  years ago but you still love exploring the world and cultures through docuntaries.Now how many stupid fucking animal viral videos do you watch on here a day? Cause I see about  clips a day on Reddit minimum. Like I started this conversation  I understand the point you are trying to make completely but its apples and oranges to compares view counts on really any documentary to really any viral video. They are consumed differently for different reasons. If Im not understanding you and youre saying that the  people who took less than a minute to watch a viral video should have instead watched this nearly documentary and you cant see the difference of the two then we have bigger problems to deal with.,Documentaries,dbm851z,1,t5_2qhlh

Does being a pedophile mean that you are attracted to children in general of both genders? Or are cases of men being attracted little boys actually a mix of two things homosexuality and pedophilia?For example I think a person could be attracted to  adults of the opposite gender  adults of the same gender  children of the opposite gender  children of the same gender.Is being a pedophile any mix of these things as long as it involves children? or do the gender things are related to an independent variable on top of pedophilia meaning homosexuality? ,Documentaries,dbvomzq,2,t5_2qhlh

10189427,0,t1_dbywdsc,Im an atheist but as often as not the fierce criticism of Muslims is coming from someone who considers themselves Christian but sees no irony there.There are nut jobs in every religion but acting like every Muslim is x worse than your average Christian is bullshit navet and bias because most people in the US are around Christians all the time and yet arent extremely fearful about any of the crazy shit in the Bible being literally acted out against them.Religion absolutely creates rifts and problems but its not a uniquely Muslim thing. Framing it as such by quoting sharia law etc is a lazy and biased way of supporting an antiMuslim mindset.If you want to argue religion is a problem and shouldnt be given a pass go for it but there is plenty of evidence Muslims in secular countries are surprisingly similar in belief to your average US Christian in terms of secular vs religious leanings. Pew Research did a couple of huge surveys about that topic a few years back interesting stuff.One doesnt excuse the other but claiming one is dramatically worse than the other for secular society doesnt make any sense as an argument.

Selfdriving cars arent special. If anything theyll open the door for licenseless driving in the future. gtMost people will scoff at the idea... but look at whats happened to mailcommunication. It has always been highly illegal to seize open and read private letters yet emails are routinely scanned and stored in databases and accessed using rubberstamped or standing warrants. That has more to do with the transmission medium than with the times  youd need to have a human being reading the content of your letter and then transcribing a copy for most of history to have access to a letters content latter. EMails are by design transmitted trough memory that can now be stored for virtually no cost. As you said mails are stored just in case. Like most surveillance data they will be deleted after an arbitarily enforced timeframe unless accessed. The way the system is supposed to work is that communications are private unless there is a good enough reason for them not to be. I dont think anyone disagrees with that fundamentally. The real discussion is about what constitutes a good enoug reason. And its totally fair to be afraid of society skewing the dynamic in favor of more sinister goals than fight children sex trafficking rings.

Why would Trump personally stiff a contracting company for k.  Why would he even be involved in a transaction that amounts to installing new toilets on the floor of just one of his many hotels?

America takes quite a few immigrants legally and illegally as it is.  A large percentage of them come here and immediately go on forms of government assistance which is a burden to the system and a large expense for the tax payer.  America is a generous country but we also must decide how many people we can reasonably accommodate and we must enforce immigration laws and insure that other countries respect our immigration laws.I know this is not an answer most people like to hear especially on Reddit where people have this image that all immigrants coming here legally and illegally  are coming here with bright eyes good intentions brindle sacks slung over their shoulders ready to start businesses and assimilate.  Unfortunately that is not often the case and more often than not we are taking people who are going to go on government assistance and welfare the second they come here.

10325528,0,t1_dcccrjv,I lived for years in Ireland where the Travellers Pavee live a nomadic life  yes nomadic on an Island. Theyre definitely an ethnic group a fact supported by recent genetic evidence. But the settled Irish whom I love generally refuse to believe in the legitimacy of the Travellers and have several incoherent ideas to support their nonbelief. Also while I was in Ireland I met some Romanians and made several trips to their country. This is confusing but factual the Roma or Gypsies are not from Romania but for whatever reasons of history many Roma live in Romania. Ive seen their atrocious gaudy unfinished mansions thirdfloor balconies unguarded by the expensive railing not yet purchased where nobody lives.  And Ive been accosted by many Roma plying the trade of manipulative andor blatant persistent begging. Romanians hate the Gypsies generally. Much of this is because Europeans think of the Roma as Romanians and the Roma are known for not working and for getting their money in alternative ways. Networks of beggars are the most visible and possibly the most benign of behaviors that the Gypsy people employ pun intended for collective gain. The Pavee and the Roma are not related genetically but yes both are ethic groups not people who chose to hit the road and become vagrant and unproductive. What they share is an alternative concept of home and of property in general. I cant condone what I dont understand but neither can I condemn. And in my experiences with normal Irish and Romanian people Ive encountered a viciousness against the unsettled people that I find  well unsettling. Thats the source of my angst on this matter. ,Documentaries,dcegf82,1,t5_2qhlh

10457305,0,t1_dcteje6,But again what do you expect of right wing voters? Many including some that I personally know dont agree with the lefts economical views. They rationally dont and wont accept them but they accept those of the right. What are they to do but vote for that idea? Yes its a shame that many not all I would argue republican representatives vote purely in spite but thats not a problem with the right wings views or stances thats a problem with the representatives elected. I argue that the reason they have been allowed to vote like that is because of irrational and ignorant people that refuse to actually attempt to even take a look into the other spectrum. Too many Americans are ridiculously blinded by political divisiveness that they are forced to double down on their beliefs and stand strong against even small amounts of opposition. Thats the problem. Not simple economic views. If we rationally looked at politics with an open mind then we could easily see through those shady representatives. Also I think you are confusing the beliefs of right wingers with the actions of right wing representatives. Many republican representatives are obviously only concerned with the rich and white and wealthy whereas many ordinary conservatives are not. Yet many people on the left refuse to accept that or consider that. That is a problem with both sides. Again if we opened ourselves up that wouldnt be an issue.Of course I believe there are a plethora of other issues we must confront I still believe that this political division is easily the biggest and the one we must first confront before tackling others.Edit also I think one could point out many instances where democratic representatives have voted against the will of the people and in spite of republican representatives.

She was told that it was in her head when her entire chest froze while driving  it was basically hell to live with.She decided not to have kids because she didnt want to pass it on to them. In her s sprays and other treatments were developed. She also happened to meet my Dad  Still very happily married.

10523608,0,t1_dd0p7ej,Schizophrenia is tentatively linked to stress but in most cases it develops without any obvious trigger.Generally the first signs of schizophrenia develop for months or even up to two years before any hallucinations or delusions begin.  They tend to start with the individual becoming progressively withdrawn and uncommunicative and losing interest in most of the activities they used to enjoy.  It can actually seem a lot like depression to an outside observer.gtIn the documentary they said something along the lines of undiagnosed schizophrenia will almost certainly manifest in a major crisis at some point. Schizophrenia isnt something that youre born with although there is some evidence that you can inherit a genetic vulnerability to developing it.  So its not necessarily that it was previously undiagnosed more likely that it simply didnt exist before a certain point.That said I think the schizophrenia diagnosis is bullshit in this case.  It sounds much more like some form of personality disorder imo.  The hallucinations shes reporting could easily be pseudopsychosis. ,Documentaries,dd0yqst,3,t5_2qhlh

If its a rocky steep incline then you cant really run it any more and you have to start hiking. Running on a trail you have to conscious of every step in order to avoid twisting an ankle. Running on a roadsidewalk theres really nothing much to worry about.

Research and you will see. Theres zerooo negative effects. Youre. So uneducated and thinking about this subject the wrong way. I could smoke or eat pot everyday and be more productive than I currently am. When I eat it and start feeling it and I go to the gym or on a run I tend to enjoy everything about what Im doing and lose myself in the activity. When I have conversation while under it I am lore accepting of new information and develope new views.You wanna police shit that has negative effects if used too much stop bitching about pot and start focusing on alcohol or tobacco. Yeah? They kill people. Unlike weed. How about we stop selling Tylenol and aspirin because I can go the the store and grab a bottle and down it and die real quick. Lets police everything huh!!!     Or let people do what the fuck they want. If I died of eating  Tylenol pills that what my choice wasnt it? It comes down to being responsible in the decisions you make. Shitty food kills and causes massive health issues everyday but you wanna come complain about a plant thats nothing hut beneficial? Youre ignorant and I say that in the nicest way. By ignorant youre not dumb ok? You just dont know. So maybe change the way you look at shit and do a little research before you open your mouth. Open your mind before your mouth my friend. Once you gather knowledge and only then is when you should say some shit like weed ruined my friends life no you simple minded fool. Youre friends ruined their life.

10614201,0,t1_ddapt8g,I thoroughly agree regarding the failed war on drugs.  But my overall point was that in this political climate where our president has already said Mexico is taking advantage of the US trying to sell lets help Mexico clean itself up! has little change of success.  I think it is the right thing to do because I can see beyond the end of my own nose but all most people hear is were sending Mexico all our money! Why are we sending them money instead of spending it here? without realizing that making Mexico a place where one wants to STAY in turn makes immigration decrease.  But you know thats a TWO step solution which is at least one step past what most Americans and politicians are willing or capable of doing.I also think the notion of getting rid of the resources the cartel has is an enormous and enormously complex task that in many ways involves rejiggering the Mexican economy and society top to bottom.

10731150,0,t3_5theu4,Truk or Chuuk as it is now known is one of the best dive sites in the world with many of those wrecks still dive able within sport diver limits. The most spooky is the Aikoko which held over  troops when it exploded killing them all instantly and the rear half sinking to the bottom to land upright. If you ever get the chance to spend a week on a liveaboard I highly recommend it.Here is the film of Jacques Cousteaus team exploring Truk in the sixties The sight of Japanese war casualty skeletons  minutes into cousteaus film was enough to spur the Japanese to mount an expedition in the late s to recover most of the remains.  However there are still many skeletons and bones left on the wrecks some of which have been fashioned into little shrines by the local divers.  In the engine of the sunken troopship Heian Maru you can still see one guy whose corpse rotted into the rusting metal of the engine room leaving him sealed in there for eternity. ,Documentaries,ddmu6c8,1,t5_2qhlh

10737702,0,t1_ddn81xh,gt Its actually a part of why Chinese people dislike the American government.No. The chinese disliked the US long before ww because weve been fucking with them in china since the s...And of course massacring them in the US...And of course banning them from immigrating to the US...The chinese are the only group of people specifically honored with a ban from immigrating to the US. There is no irish exclusion act or nigerian exclusion act. Its called the century of humiliation...They are a tad bit upset about all the invading stealing opiuming murdering and of course raping of the chinese people...It was reported that Japanese troops were astonished by other Alliance troops raping civilians. Roger Keyes who commanded the British destroyer Fame and accompanied the Gaselee Expedition noted that the Japanese had brought their own regimental wives prostitutes to the front to keep their soldiers from raping Chinese civilians. Thousands of Chinese women committed suicide The Daily Telegraph journalist E. J. Dillon stated it was to avoid rape by Alliance forces and he witnessed the mutilated corpses of Chinese women who were raped and killed by the Alliance troops. The French commander dismissed the rapes attributing them to gallantry of the French soldier. A foreign journalist George Lynch said there are things that I must not write and that may not be printed in England which would seem to show that this Western civilization of ours is merely a veneer over savagery.One of the reasons why the nationalistsKuomintang lost was because of their slavish prowestern stance. They were viewed as traitors by much of the chinese population because they were getting help from the USwest...The hate for the US and the west existed long before ww. We werent too nice to the chinese... We read about the japanese atrocities in ww because thats recent and its convenient. But we were committing atrocities against the chinese for more than a century before ww...Just like the propaganda loves to portray the germansnazis as antisemitic and the angloworld as the saviors of the jews.

10756264,0,t1_ddolary,My biggest issue has been social anxiety and isolation. Its been  years since leaving but I still have an issue with leaving my house. This stems from living in the same small city as the cult for about two years after leaving. Every time I left the house I would be approached by members and grilled. I started to seclude more and more to avoid those interactions and despite living states away now I still have a hard time going out in public. I have a difficult time partaking in anything involving Abrahamic religion. It was a Christian cult so anything involving prayer churches or worship leaves me sick and anxious.  My trust issues seem to show up when it comes to trusting religious communities. I do have a hard time maintaining friendships because of being afraid that Im a burden or that Im too much work which is something else that stems from my time with the cult.There are some phrases or words that set me off. My husband and I have had to sit down and figure out how to argue with each other when we get frustrated because even a simple disagreement could send me on a downward spiral. The reason is because I struggle with blaming myself for everything. The cult I attended really drilled it into me that everything was my fault. This leads to anxiety and depression and eventually total regression.I still have flashbacks which lead to spaciness and disassociation. Those can come on with absolutely no trigger or reason other than my mind wandering and remembering.My entire life is now an obstacle course that Ive had to learn how to maneuver. I dont know how I would have navigated it without my husband and my mom there to help me through the times I couldnt find a reason to keep picking myself up.

10869323,0,t1_ddy1wph,gt Youre not going to rewrite history. Goes on to rewrite history while ignoring contemporary accounts.If the southern position was significantly different from the north when it comes to race why were there white european slaves? Why were there massacres of blacks in the north during the civil war? Why did many slaves who escaped to the north get recaptured and sent back? Why was slavery still allowed in union territories? Why was it a crime to be a member of the underground railroad in the north?The fact is that racism in america both before and during the civil war was very much the same in the north as it was the south. The origins for the race riots in chicago new york tulsa california tacoma etc have its roots in the widespread racism that was prevalent in the north during the civil war not just the south. Why? Because northerners were just as racist as southerners. You cant single out southerners as being more racist unless you actually rewrite history.Nobody but the extreme fringe thought blacks were equal to whites. Very few people thought that itd be okay if freed black slaves set up shop next door. Lincoln was opposed to territories having the ability to decide for themselves about slavery because he was sure theyd choose to allow it. Lincoln himself saidgt I am not nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races that I am not nor ever have been in favor of making voters or jurors of negroes nor of qualifying them to hold office nor to intermarry with white people and I will say in addition to this that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which I believe will forever forbid the two races living together on terms of social and political equality. And in as much as they cannot so live while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. I say upon this occasion I do not perceive that because the white man is to have the superior position the negro should be denied everything. I do not understand that because I do not want a negro woman for a slave I must necessarily want her for a wife. My understanding is that I can just let her alone.Slavery was an economic system and thats why people fought and died for it. If the north would have outlawed slavery and reimbursed the slaveowners for it the civil war simply wouldnt have happened.Slavery and racism are two different things and if youre going to actually understand what the civil war was about and if youre actually going to stop either of them today you have to understand that. The reality is there are more slaves today in the world in  than there were in the US in . The reality is that racism and racially driven violence is literally everywhere in america right now in  and trying to lay that at the feet of the south just allows it to propagate unchecked  because it gives actual racists a free pass. gt madeupbecauseitmakesyoufeelbetterBecause northern exceptionalism doesnt do that at all.If southern hillbillies are what propagate racial violence why did neonazi groups explode in the PNW and california during the s and s? Why have there been racially driven massacres in historically northern states and western states?Racism is about socioeconomics not about where you are born.

10881736,0,t1_de2bbzf,It was atrocious sure but German treatment of Russian civilians was even worse not to mention the civilians of other nations such as Poland which had nearly  of its population wiped out by the German occupation. It is a fact that German rape of Eastern European women occurred en masse and the historical consensus is that over the course of  years of German conquest of Eastern Europe untold millions of women were raped. But you know why we have all of those stories of the rapes of the Red Army but none of the Germans?A. Postwar propaganda minimized the suffering of Eastern Europe while the undeniable brutality of the Soviets was given due credit.B. Germans were able to talk about these things at some point in West Germany. Freedom of speech as such was far more restricted in the USSR. Historical research in the USSR was done based on politics not necessarily always fact. This is another reason why the rapes committed by the Red Army were so quickly hidden away and forgotten within the USSR. Control of information means you control the truth.C. The Russians left more survivors. Estimates of rape committed by German soldiers on the Eastern Front vary wildly due to the fact that there simply were virtually no surviving victims of German brutality. The Germans murdered millions of Eastern Europeans. They raped countless women as well. Historical accounts of German atrocities against civilian populations are nigh endless. Over the course of  years they pillaged murdered and raped their way from Poznan to the gates of Moscow. It is said that after the year after the Red Army had invaded Berlin there were approximately  million more abortions carried out by German women. That means that those  million rape victims survived the War. The simple truth is that Slavic or Jewish women raped by Germans were usually either killed shortly afterwards or simply died before the war ended. There are countless stories of insane brutality. During the Warsaw Uprising German auxiliaries recaptured a hospital with a maternity ward and began raping and murdering the pregnant women. A Home Army soldier who saw the aftermath described women about to give birth who had been raped their bodies cut open and their newborn children still connected to them with their umbilical cords bayonnetted to their bodies while they were alive. The atrocities of the Germans in Eastern Europe during WWII have only ever been matched in sheer atrocity by the crimes committed by the Japanese in China. Anyone who talks about the injustices committed upon German POWs without first acknowledging that fact as if their suffering was something exceptional is either uninformed or most likely just a wehraboo.  ,Documentaries,de2dgqb,9,t5_2qhlh

What the fuck are you talking about governments that have uncontacted tribes generally leave them alone. When these particular missionaries turned up  of the tribals died from foriegn diseases. Is this somehow the secular governments fault?gtAnd disease got both way black plague came from asia and nearly wiped out europe later we got syphillis from Cuba and more recently think of ebola spreading from one place to several state in africa. Or how the UN is the most likely culprit for bringing cholera to Haity.This is so off topic... What is even your point here? We have tribes who exist and are able to handle all the diseases they already have and we have globalised westerners immune to many many dangerous diseases from all over the world but are stil carrying them and can infect the tribe.In this case most of the tribe died. In all cases of uncontacted tribes and missionaries the tribe mostly dies.You cant really defend that. Your argument is most of the time its the secular government which just isnt true at all. If the tribe sits on vast resource wealth then they are usually contacted by loggers and miners. Otherwise governments prefer to just leave them alone. There are actual humanitarian issues and its considered to be in bad taste internationally these days if you contact remote tribes on your land.Tbh the biggest argument against missionaries is that they are preying on the illiterate and uneducated because these are the easiest people to convert.

11022937,0,t1_deh4i9a,The majority of the crimes in Scandinavia is committed by a minority of the prisoners a small number of repeat offenders that commits many crimes each. For example in Sweden  of the population commits  of the violent crimes. These people are most likely males that begun their criminal career in an early age and will continue it for the majority of their lives.Swedish prisons does a great job with most prisoners and it shows in their excellent recidivism rate  . However where I think that the prisons and the whole justice system falls short is with these repeat offenders especially since Sweden has recently seen a rise in gang violence. These repeat offenders are able to commit a long list of crimes before they finally are incarcerated and when they get out they soon reoffend. They arent common enough to force a system overhaul but there will be law changes this year that aim to hinder them by incarcerating them earlier.,Documentaries,dehf4it,3,t5_2qhlh

11040449,0,t1_dejazqn,gt often times laws and morals arent the same.We agree on that point  this is the law in Texas and I find it highly immoral.  You say you like the law dont like how it applied to the prostitute and go on a tangent how prostitution should be legalized even though you said you dont want to talk about specifics.  OK so you can dismiss one specific case but the larger issue stands  there are many other ways where this law would still applly conventional robberies where the robber is startled and runs away and the homeowner chases after him which indicates to me the homeowner was not in fear for their life and shoots him in the back.Imagine the broad scenario I just said but the homeowner missed.  Say the robber stole  sitting out on the counter before fleeing.  The case goes to trial the robber is  and this is the first time he has been caught and the thief is found guilty and the jury condemns him to death.  Do you think anybody would find that a reasonable outcome?  Yet if the homeowner had chased him down and was a better shot and killed him on the spot without the benefit of a jury there are many people who are happy with that outcome.,Documentaries,dejeys8,1,t5_2qhlh

11057716,0,t1_delbrgr,I think those are all really interesting points and I take your point about the end but the us is the filmmakers rather than lefties.  What I mean by that is that us v them isnt so much about left v right so much as it is filmmakers v those who for good reasons I think dont want their views captured on camera.We spoke to a lot of Trump supporters but they almost always declined to appear.  The reasons for this are not entirely clear yet hence were not quite ready to pass comment on it.  There are lots of possible explanations but we are wary about speculating at least until we have had more time to engage people  this is the first part in an ongoing processproject.We shot on Wall Street where we met the most Trump supporters but who were by far the most resistant to speaking on camera in Harlem Coney Island and Brooklyn.  We approached people of all ages and ethnoracial groups  some were happy to share their views with us some were happy to be filmed and some were not.Whats really interesting to me is the relative reluctance of Trump moderates to speak on record.  Whilst this is frustrating from a filmmaking perspective and I imagine and audience perspective that is simply the reality we faced.  Hence we decided to celebrate and explore that silence because in a lot of ways it remains the most important phenomenon we have captured.  I hope to visit other places in the US soon to see how that pattern shifts in areas more openly supportive of the president.

The real threats are not to our existance as a nation but to the safety welfare and security of that nation. For instance the current debate about health care is something where a little bit of fear for the well being of our citizens is healthy to drive a positive outcome.  You could also argue that climate change is something we should be afraid of because it poses a real threat to the stability of the current world order.

11111825,0,t1_derg7ih,Not sure if sincere question meme or shitpost.... but what youre asking is basically the Paradox of value or Diamondwater paradox i.e. how can something which is generally more useful amp vital to survival command a lower marketprice where people are free to bid whatever they feel it is worth?The likely most correct answer is explained by Marginalism or the the Subjective Theory of Value which says that value is not an inherent property of a good or service but is variable and a consequence of the fact that a buyer will only voluntarily enter into an exchange for a good at particular point in time if they personally value having possession that thing more than the price he has to pay for it and all the other alternate things they could possibly use that money to acquire instead of swapping it for that particular good or service.In your example the warm sweater has a different value in different situations A low value to someone in a warm country they dont need it so dont receive muchany value from acquiring it compared to the other ways their finite amount of disposable income could be spent  they would however probably accept one for free as a gift even if they wouldnt buy it at a  discount assuming they wouldnt have to pay anything to store it A higher value to someone in a cold country who doesnt own any sweaters amp feels that they need one A lower value to someone in a cold country who already owns a variety of  functional amp aesthetically pleasing sweaters  theres little value to them of buying one more,Documentaries,deril32,20,t5_2qhlh

11267980,0,t1_df8fv8t,I know Im late here but I can give you some info on his Tats. I broke them down for a previous thread and the link posted below gave me some new angles. His chest piece conveys that he is a thief and has been for a while. The Mother Mary is a thieves talisman  the baby Jesus indicates that he is a son of the system or that he was born a thief. The angels on his clavicle most likely indicate a thieves luck someone watching over him. The size and spacing indicates that he isnt exactly part of the old guard. His chest piece is likely post.Given the lack of text the woman on his right bicep is likely a lover. I cant see enough of the tattoo on his upper right bicep to tell you what it means it might be a take on an orthodox cathedral another indication he is a thief. Most of these tattoos are modeled after St. Basils in Moscow but the number and style of the domes have special meanings. What I can tell you is that the devil floating above the tattoo represents contempt for the system this is known as bearing teeth or grinning. If you look at the bottom picture on the page you can see the mans left hand. The cross on the ring finger indicates that he has been to prison at least once. I cant tell but that might be a cross on the middle finger that would indicate that he has been twice. The style of the crosses indicates his rank low level. His low rank is also made obvious by the lack of stars on his clavicle or other defining tatts. The symbol on his pinky might be the most interesting... It looks a lot like the mark of a waffle eater. A waffle eater is a man who is willing to perform oral sometimes anal sex on another inmate often for favors. Normally they would have a series of dots in the diagonal white space these would indicate what he was willing to do. Given the theme of the picture I would guess he would trade sexual favors as an old tart for heroin. ,Documentaries,df97j0m,4,t5_2qhlh

In the Manhattan realm where I am familiar these are the people endowing the Met Opera New York Ballet Met Museum etc. Next time you engage in any way with the arts take a look at who their patrons are youll see some familiar aristocratic names from Trump to Soros to Koch to Carnegie.

The pulse shooter wasnt even part of ISIS he just pledged allegiance before carrying out the attack. The fact is no one can claim to have an absolutely consistent definition of terrorism because people will always use the word to mean what they want it to mean like you right now. Quebec city was a hate crime? Didnt the shooter belong to quite a few racist groups? Didnt the shooter plan the attack? How exactly would the FBI get involved with an attack outside the US? Does that mean terrorism is specific to the US? All these questions just go to show what a garbage definition of terrorism youre providing. But this is reddit so we need to scrutinize the semantics if we wanna hide the bigotry behind it all. The only point that your argument could possibly be making is that westerners should fear Muslims. There is no other takeaway so understand why I call you a bigot even though you explicitly say either way bad.If you try being a human being and just dropping the semantics maybe youd realize that innocent people dont deserve to be killed whether its the US bombing a school shelter and killing dozens only to do the same a few weeks later or a girl being executed for being raped.,Documentaries,dfd1ko9,0,t5_2qhlh

11302677,0,t1_dfcvtbq,That is completely unfair. You are deliberately misinterpreting her tweets to further your political agenda. Linda Sansour has made it abundantly clear that she does not subscribe to the homophobic misogynist religious law many other Muslims follow. When she talks about Sharia it is clear she is making reference to her own interpretation of her faith. And what does her Sharia law tell her to do. Fight for womens rights Fight for LGBT rights and Fight against antiMuslim bigotry. What exactly was your problem with her again? She is making the same argument that good Christians have been giving us for a long time. Even though the religion at large may be shitty it can be interpreted in a virtuous way. This is certainly something you can argue against but there are some merits to this argument. But especially important is that this means her understanding of the term Sharia law is different from yours. This means that when you attack her using your definition your arguments arent particularly effective. To win arguments you must understand your opponents position. Right now you havent put in that work yet.,Documentaries,dfd541h,25,t5_2qhlh
11302683,0,t1_dfd024x,Well it wasnt. I was about murders committed by an Islamist theocracy which is a bit different. Besides finding examples of religious fundamentalists that arent Muslim isnt hard. Granted they do kill much fewer people but that was beside my point. My point was all religions can be used to justify violence and become fundamentalist. Which is why we need to combat the real problem radicalism  regardless from which side. Yes at the moment that includes overproportionally many Muslims but thats just how its now. It was different a few centuries ago and it might be again one day. Christian terror attack  depending how you count the  Norway attack though this was probably more right wing or antiIslamic.  the attacks on abortion clinics have cost lives too and most of the perpetrators to claim religious Christian reasons.  a bit longer ago the troubles in Northern Ireland killed about  peopleand so onAgain at the moment most religiously inspired attacks are committed by Islamists well if you go by fatalities otherwise it becomes hard to calculate but that doesnt change the fact that its not the only religion used to inspire violence. ,Documentaries,dfd54x5,-3,t5_2qhlh

While using a mirror is a cool idea there is no evidence anything like that was used at all. In fact it was compared to how knights used mount horses in the dark ages modern theorists thought they were lowered onto their horses from a contraption it was even shown in movies but they simply mounted their horses like anyone else.

New missionaries are being sent to haven areas already flush with members to try and keep converts within the church after year . Most young converts stop attending after the first year or twogt percent of the new Latterday Saint converts in the United States who do become inactive stop attending within three to five years after joining the Church. Of those who drop out  percent return to active participation in five to ten years.They are retaining . of converts.  Birth rates since the s have been on the declineHowever they have a larger average of family size then most global families the average age of members is extremely low The main way the LDS Church expands its numbers is through having large families that keep children in the church.  This cascades and multigenerational families have become a must.  The nd major way they expand is by entering rd and nd world countries that have lower qualities of life that are cheaper and easier to provide aidreadmembership bonusesAs shown by a LDS researcher here there was a decrease of  in stateside congregational growth and wardbranch setup.  The setup goes branch ward stake in terms of size  The USA has the largest number of mormons globallyEurope has been stagnating heavily and no measurable growth could be reported at all.

Mexico houses the nd largest group of Mormons globally.Since the mormon hierarchy is setup like a Pyramid this is super concerning financially.In  Garment designs were promptly updated underwear to be worn at all times that is blessed to help you resist sexual urges around the time antiLGBT discrimination bills were being passed.  Also temple designs were updated as well.  There are special cloths to wear while being baptized and baptizing for the deadby proxy.  This was pushed once more in  as well  In previous years designs were not as heavily advertised within the church though it was announced regularly.  These years it was blown far and wide and large numbers of internet articles were slammed up to push the update.  Im not sure if this was the church getting savy or pushing for money...maybe both?At all of the yearly gathering you can clearly see a major focus on warning children and adults of the dangers of pornography  This is mainly to keep the members having large families with tons of children.  If you dont pay your  tithing you cannot enter into the temples to perform rituals.For a while the mormons ran an adoption agency that recently shutdown to bring children into the faith.This was recently discontinued.  Perhaps the experiment didnt bear fruit as much as they had hoped.  It certainly wasnt because of bad press when trying to gain control of AmericaTemple attendance is not mandatory but seen as a way to inflate membership through baptism of the dead   This practice of baptizing deceased family members into the church has helped drive genealogy efforts to all time records.You can view the current statistics here and baptisms for the dead are seen as permanent members.Anyway. tldrThe Church membership numbers do not add up because they are retroactively adding dead people usually entire families in one go to the registry.Porn is seen as a huge threat to family growth it may be removing the pressure to marry young and have children within the churchMormons have huge families and their multigenerational children keep the church alive million members of income is tithed to bring in  million per yearYearly net growths can be currently attributed to setting up in fresh and poor markets.By giving aid they encourage membership.Members get access to food water manpower.Mandatory Blessed readmagic underpant designs were updated to help fund the church so personal non church related money could be spent on passing of discrimination lawsAdopt or dont be saved is overI have very mixed feelings about the Church.

Why wasnt everybody screaming WW when Obama upgraded UAV bombing into W.Bushs wet dream? Its the same people doing the same shit its just a different team up to bat.That being said I have to watch my mouth at work and in life to get what I want and what my family company or client wants.

11659597,0,t1_dgh1i00,An implosion type would use plutonium which is produced through nuclear decay of a reactor level fission of minimally enriched uranium. An implosion bomb is much more difficult to produce you need conventional explosives to go off in a very particular order and have geometry such that the core is compressed in certain spots at the exact right times to produce a supercritical mass that forms in milliseconds if not nanoseconds. And that bomb would still be huge and pretty much immobile. To reduce size you need lenses to direct energy in such a way that your supercritical mass forms even more precisely using less starting materials. Now a gun type would be easier to build but requires majority U which is extremely hard to obtain not to mention the horrible efficiency due to the lag of the slug into the core causing the reaction to start at a less then perfect critical mass geometry losing a lot of neutrons to atmosphere. You would also need a neutron source something like a BEPo modulated neutron initiator and neutron reflectors. The simpler the design the larger the bomb size and the harder it is to obtain materials. The more concealable efficient bombs are extremely difficult to produce. Id be more concerned with a dirty bomb. You really need the support of a nation state to produce a bomb. Now procuring one from a shady nation state is different. ,Documentaries,dghmoy8,2,t5_2qhlh

I personally prefer smoking over drinking but I was sure to do as much research as I could mostly just through Google Scholar to find all of the negative effects of it before I decided I wanted to try it. Its a harmful mindset thinking that its all sunshine and roses.EDIT I suppose I should clarify what I meant. I didnt say that it isnt used for medical purposes what Im saying is that negative side effects exist for the drug. I acknowledge that there are medical uses for the drug but I am mainly acknowledging the negative effects with recreational use. I am lucky enough to have no medical uses for it so I feel it is important to know the harm it could potentially inflict on my body and my brain as major or minor as it may be. ,Documentaries,dgigehz,256,t5_2qhlh

We also have thousands of years of testing aspirin in humans. Of course aspirin would never be approved by the FDA if discovered today. Bleach is a common argument as to why something that kills organisms in a test tube can not necessarily be used in live patients. Bleach kills many bacteria. Do not treat strep throat by drinking bleach. I am  pro medical marijuana legalization. I have Multiple Sclerosis and stand to benefit more than most. Sound arguments for legalization of medical marijuana are watered down by unproven statements about marijuana curing or having the potential to cure disease. They weaken the overall case. The strongest argument for medical marijuana is that it is an effective treatment for many disabling symptoms. ,Documentaries,dgkvcrm,1,t5_2qhlh
