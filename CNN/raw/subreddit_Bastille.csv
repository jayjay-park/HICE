2323373,0,t1_clyavyj,Yea your right.It just sucks that the music industry is so fucked up like that. To jank a concert so your boys can go get press somewhere is fucked up.Its all good. Ill still buy their records but I doubt I ever make it out to see one of their shows on my dime again. I wouldnt want to reschedule a show spend a bunch of coin on a good time and then have it yanked out from under me because The Tonight Show offered them . minutes. Because lets remember thats what the press release said it was over an unforseen scheduling conflict.Sorry Im just bitter. I really liked that band. I learned their songs on guitar and can sing the fronts and back up vox by heart.My disappointment cut pretty deep on this one. Ive only liked  bands enough in the last  years to go out and put money on them for a good time and this was the rd.It was supposed to be a much more awesome event than it was.,Bastille,clyvs9q,1,t5_2vojc

9190700,0,t1_d8gdng4,Yes StubHub is a resale site a.k.a. a combination of scalpers who actively buy up tickets in order to resell at a huge markup ANDOR regular people whose plans change and want to sell the tix they cant use.So I am also wondering how they got FL tix??? Were they actually part of the presale and the scalpers bought them up? Or is it a scamhonest mistake?!??,Bastille,d8gzlng,1,t5_2vojc

10334163,0,t3_5ntre0,I chose to get seats for the Barclays show but managed to catch them twice for their smaller NYC sets. If thats any indication getting to the shows a bit before the doors open is sufficient. You can see my face very clearly in the pic that Dan posted for the Williamsburg show last October.,Bastille,dcffo6u,2,t5_2vojc

11361732,0,t3_5yzciy,The music was really loud and I couldnt really understand what they were saying at all. However I really love them as people. They were so nice humble and genuine. You can tell that they were nervous and all of this was so foreign to them. I checked their Instagram and they made a post about how they finally had a tour bus and they werent driving around in a shitty van anymore. Its nice to see them in their very humble beginnings ,Bastille,dfjtxgi,1,t5_2vojc
