5552316,0,t1_cwkx67k,Maybe Im wrong because what th f I know but I think their staying in the glass closet is more a way to escape becoming a public couple than being known as openly gay. Both are reserved men I cant see them giving away the details of their loving life and once youre out as a couple its pretty impossible to avoid a certain amount of exposition. Of course they are not famous but I suppose its easier this way. No questions no need to create a fake public couple life like every other star couple do.

6609206,0,t3_465k5v,Its a twoway street isnt it?  Celebs using social media expose themselves to the public and the public see a glimpse of how real that person is to the perception of who they think they are.  Pluses and minuses here but Im also sure we hold them to different standards targeting them for extra persecution for any misstep as well as extra admiration when they do something we agree with.  Stephen has a huge following and he leaving again reminded me of Simon Pegg who also had millions of followers but after a few runins decided to leave it now to his management to run. I think the balancing act of wanting to say what you really feel while thinking of your image because of your work is difficult.  Probably a good reason to have an alias anon account similar to how you have a separate personal account and a business account.  Then theres the Adele thing which of course isnt her fault and I didnt probably wont either hear her Grammy performance but I certainly saw the reaction to the offtune piano.  Her responses though were simple but effective saying...shit happens and something like this being a good excuse to eat a fastfood burger  Im sure she said other things in private but this seems to fit with who I think she is.,RichLee,d02y4vh,1,t5_3aajb

9650479,0,t3_5d8tk4,There is a Periscope video of LP and Sanjayan in bot twitter link below. I hope someone records it before it disappears from Periscope platform. The audio is crap but there are a few interesting things shared.  To paraphrase LPs comments from what I could understand LPs understanding before he was involved with CI about climate change was it was mindboggling an inevitability that was going on.  Some kind of doomsday thing. Through CI he has met a core group of scientists who are breaking down the problem accumulating data and coming up with innovative solutions to meet the problem. Hes met philanthropists policy makers demanding action.  Met indigenous people sharing their wisdom of overcoming problems From where he sits LP sees value in showing up learning and finding his own way to participate.  I play parts in movies and to have the opportunity to learn from people like Sanjayan and be useful is a good thing ? Host mentions that LP has a new film coming out called Momentum for Change to be shown at dinner. Not sure because she asks LP about it and he talks about his mountain in Nature is Speaking so is it the same thing?  update its not the same thing there is a post below about Momentum for Change LP as I said talks about his part in voicing the mountain.  About the personification of nature and then he looks to Sanjayan to explain further... Sanjayan then explains how Nature is Speaking campaign came about.  He said that the mountain was something the Chinese audience asked for.  Its symbolic to Chinese.  Inspirational and Lee had just come off playing this incredible role on The Hobbit.  And the voice and the gravitas that he brings to that voice really seemed to bring this mountain into its own ? Sanjayan talks about another film to be released online but it features a local artist.  Not sure if LP is part of it LP says storytelling is important.  Idea of coming around the fireplace stories we tell each other is important so Nature Speaking Campaign is like storytelling.  Personification of Nature is in every culture in the world. Sanjayan talks about real people who struggle to put meals on table using only charcoal so ability to supply clean energy to the whole world is important it will help stabilize a climate not only Lee on his Farm in NY but those in Africa.  It helps all of us everywhere  Hostess asks LP about his travels around the world and his work for CI.  He says he has been inspired.  He talks about going to Kenya Iceland and would like to go back to China.  He realizes in his travels how much we have in common and were all moving there together.  He learnt a lot in Iceland.  When he was in Kenya he saw communities who supported conservation keeping elephants alive establishing intelligent networks to help stop poaching.  This conference also is a big part of that so it gives me hope.  Sanjayan then said and now were in Morocco. Hostess asks whats next for CI?  Sanjayan mentions a couple of things.  First he will keep working on forest conservation working with indigenous people.  He mentions an exciting rd wave to conservation where instead of relying on pockets of governments or rich individuals  of the planet is owned and managed by stewards of the land the local communities.  He thinks the world is ready now for this rd wave to be explored further.  Sanjayan said a lot of films have been produced M and available online receiving  million views.  Nature is Speaking is still important and encourages people to visit site and share with others.  He then mentions he and Lee are working on a Virtual Reality project along with a few others.  He talks about a VR film out next year where they want to immerse people into the Amazon Rainforest with indigenous communities so they can really see what storing carbon looks like from their perspective. Sanjayan then asks viewers to join a thunderclap via CIs twitter handle.UPDATE Better recording ,RichLee,da2mdrs,3,t5_3aajb

He was probably rushing certain days and skipping others like Tuesday to get home to talk to Lee before Lee went to bed. As for skipping stage door last night its possible Lee is back home.His lack of comments on BS however is surprising.

9938247,0,t1_db2xy50,I dont think his cancelling live tweeting relates to the morning show. The news that he will be on the morning show has been known to him and us early before so why would he announce he would live tweet at the first place if he knew he couldnt do it due to his need for early rest? Why didnt he just not announce it? Theres no need to pretend he could live tweet then cancel it isnt there? ,RichLee,db2z8z4,1,t5_3aajb
