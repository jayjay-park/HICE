8315631,0,t3_4tfa87,Dude Ive literally been in exactly the same place...  years first love she started fucking someone casually a week after the break up. It tore me apart when I found out. She didnt seem to care in the slightest.Let me tell you something I learned girls get over guys FAST. They can replace you faster than you can snap your fingers. Its a biological thing girls have no reason to be biologically attached to their SO since all he is is a sperm donor and a provider role can be replaced whereas guys have to be biologically attached to their SO because she is possibly carrying his baby.Its a normal process for you to feel broken hearted and also for her to replace you instantly. You have no value to her but she still has value to you. Both of those are normal.Give it some time it took me roughly  months after the break up before I felt ok seeing other people... and it was the BEST thing ever. Im currently with a girl who is eons more compatible than my first gf.It gets better dude just hang in there,BreakUps,d5h0do4,0,t5_2ra79

That doesnt mean theyre going to hurt but thats they way love is we humans never truly forget the ones we really loved. As for your situation... have you been with a different girl since the breakup ? I believe until you dont date around and actually hook up you wont know for sure if thats what you really wanted. On the other hand... has your ex moved on ? Is she seeing dating anyone ? What do you feel about that ?,BreakUps,d5kbngd,1,t5_2ra79

Ive also become very passionate of fitness in the process so even if a day that I feel off I tell myself that Im cheating.  Try a preworkout or amino energy to get you there.  Multivitamins also make you feel better altogether.  It sounds like you have an idea where your relationship is headed.  Doesnt mean you have to break up it just means you have to learn to look at things from the outside.  Whenever youre feeling anxious about your relationship take a deep breath.  And then focus on your breathing for  seconds to a minute.  Tell yourself youre okay and then figure out what bothered you.  Is your fear justified? Then confront it.  Is it a fear you created in your head? If it is then crumple it up and throw it in the trash.  But just breathe.  Theres a reason they have emergency oxygen masks on airplanes.

8720230,0,t3_4ogf96,Here is my story.  Sorry I am quite older than the average Reddit user but I love the site.I am a  year old bachelor graduate degree corporate jobs retired on disability.  In college back in  yes Im fucking old I met the woman of my dreams or I should really say she met me.  This girl was  stunning in fact she was homecoming queen at the university that year.  She was also very bright bio duel major athletic and WAY out of my league.  I said earlier she met me that is she approached me in a dance club and tried to pick me up.  I thought her friends were having a laugh on me so when she turned her back I scooted out the door.  The next day she tracked me down to my secret library basement spot and laughingly asked if I wanted to blow her off again.  It dawned on me she was really interested in me.  Im a tall Irish guy good shape then and now have all my hair! but no movie star.The relationship developed quickly we seemed to know each others thoughts and I was in love for the first time in my life.  Sadly I graduated and she went of to a well known school in London for a couple of years.  We wrote but I had no great expectations she was in a huge city and around  a lot of interesting people.Anyways I had always had a dark side negative thoughts suicidal ideations since I was a young kid.  I also had developed a love of bourbon.  I was struggling in  when out of the blue this young woman called me to say she would be in New York in a few weeks and we could meet up.  The appointed date arrives and we have a nice evening on the town dinner good conversation no drinking.  She wanted to spend the night at my place which was a micro loft and we talked in bed until the wee hours of the morning.  At about am she tells me I am not successful enough for her dont have a clear plan for my life.  She then packs up and walks out.  No argument not cross words just her pronouncement and swoosh out the door.  I didnt do anything didnt chase her didnt cry just looked at her as she went up the street.Within a week I went into a tailspin worse depression panic attacks heavy drinking.  In  I end up in psych ward and got sober.  My life is all fucked up job gone horrible feelings fear.  I am lonely in the rubber room so I try to call this girl dumb I know.  I call her parents number no idea where she is got her mom on the phone and she tells me the girl is married.  I say thank you mam and then really want a stiff drink.  It was final kick in the gut.Anyways several more hospitalizations for the next couple years finally meds are working.  Diagnosed as bipolar depressive anxiety disorder.  I know this girl is gone for good put it out of my mind.  I start to build a new life get a job with a huge european firm and things take off.  Not looking back all is good until this summer.My last labrador died at the end of June I was grief stricken screaming at the sky cursing god.  Then a few weeks later something weird happened I started thinking about this girl.  I hadnt seen her in over  years.  Did a google search found some pictures of her sent me into a dark dark spiral.  I have been crying every day for about a month.  My mind is trying to figure out a way to change the past or how to meet her.  I intellectually know it is a fantasy but still the mind is racing.Lesson  Never look back.  Love yourself even if your brain is messed up.Feedback appreciated.,BreakUps,d6vo3r4,4,t5_2ra79

8754382,0,t1_d6zjrix,I experience that lonely feeling too. When I was in the relationship Ive isolated myself from friends and other social events. I think this also makes the break up process so much more painful and hard. Its because youre now having to learn to be social independently and its the most uncomfortable feeling ever!! When we broke up I didnt lose the love of my life I lost my best friend as well. School helped me because it gave me a routine and forced me to be around other people in class. It also gave me the opportunity to just say hey wanna grab a bite after class or go to happy hour? If your friends want something in return for hanging out with you then you might want to reevaluate them. Friends should want to be there for you regardless. Playing online games helped me a little. Ive also tried MeetUp which allows you to meet with random strangers to do different things you enjoy I.e yoga playing basketball tech things etc. The only thing about MeetUp is that it puts you in a really vulnerable place because you feel really alone. Bottom line its going to be uncomfortable and I dont really have the answer as you can probably tell from the scattered reply. Just know that youre not alone in this. Im here if you need to chat.

8905950,0,t3_528iti,I know exactly how you feel Im basically in your shoes except we tried I tried he just mostly existed to keep the relationship going and building together there were many issues so we even broke up for a time and came back together but only a little bit was fixed and many things got worse and it got to a point where he kept doing more and more hurtful things without regard for me his actions and words rarely matched he was hard to even trust and I was getting frustrated and depressed that no matter what happened I was to blame or I was unreasonable or I was not letting things go or I was misunderstanding or hes just going to do whatever because hes the man and I can take it or leave it and he would say cruel things to me but if I was ever critical of him he was very offended and then treated me even worse...  Not a mentality healthy guy at all and was bordering on some other mental conditions which I used to think stemmed from his divorce but now I see that much of that was already internal to him prior to her it was just all made worse after her but with her he was willing to at least work at things and try with me not really he only ever paid lip service. Always watch peoples actions compared to their words and judge somebody by their past actions and poor decisions. No matter how you love someone people like that are destroyers until they recognize their own pattern and get the help that they truly need otherwise all theyll do is destroy you in the process. We pushed it long enough that it destroyed me and Im still picking up the pieces of me and of my life. I loved him with my whole heart but I dont even think he ever gave me all of his. Its better you ended it then let it get to the situation mine did a couple months ago where my ex ended it creating an absolutely horrible and mentally unhealthy wake of destruction and cruelty as thats his personality as thats what happens with people like thatb when the healthy person doesnt walk away first.I truly love the good man in him still but not this other asshole and butt hurt little boy he seems to be acting out as instead and hope he finds his mental clarity peace and self awareness to really resolve all his issues and to be heathy and whole. I tried to show him and to be the good in the world but I couldnt be his rock anymore will all that was waged against me.Until then hell continue his path of destruction and I will stay far far away from him. I hope he gets some real therapy Im seeking it out for myself too to better undersand why people act like this and how I contributed and to improve myself. Ive never had a relationship before with somebody that was so mentally unhealthy it was overall usually very good with amazingly extreme highs but then all to common incredibly cruel and painful lonely confusing draining and heart shattering lows which shook my own sanity and mental fortitude at times.  Ive learned his poor behavior was always internal to him not me sure I had my failures too we are all human but they all paled in comparison and there was nothing I could do to help him if he didnt want my help. I shouldve stayed away from him I knew he was not in the right place mentally right from the start although I saw the best in him and wanted to make his life great... I didnt realize that that came at the cost of my life. I thought both combined and grew not one took and one gave.,BreakUps,d7id72c,3,t5_2ra79

She finally made the decision that she wants better and she jumped boat to the next guy. In the process she is insecure and keeps you as an option in case things dont work out. Your job is to better yourself.  Get back to the gym focus on career and purpose in life.  Start dating asap. Rest assured she is watching and as you start having more fun she will be testing waters whether a guy is there or not.  She wants to see if you changed back to who you were or even better.  Give it a few months. She will start testing and then when you are indifferent she will start wondering why you arnt contacting her and she all the sudden have a full profile and you wont be blocked lol.

9519520,0,t1_d9ldlwj,I dont think its possible to be happy alone. I dont believe in that selfsustainable noncodependent individualist stuff either. What makes my life fulfilling isnt little hobbies or knowledge or talents or whatever...its the people I love and who love me back. The hobbies and such are nice but the people I get to share and experience this with are really what makes life worth it. I mentioned this in a post a few days ago but I think whats important is loving others. There isnt just your ex. Theres your best friend. I know I know...your best friend was your ex but surely you had other best friends too? My ex told me I was his best friend the person he connected with on a level hes never connected with anyone before...but now what? He doesnt want me in his life anymore. But you know what? My parents love me. My cousin who Ive known since birth loves me and shes been my true best friend since then too haha. My few friends from high school love me. The new people Ive met in university care deeply for me. I realized that Im surrounded by so much love but never took the time to really appreciate them. I put so so so much effort to loving my ex and neglected to love the people who have been with me even before I met my ex. Im sure there are special people in your life who hate seeing you devastated by this relationship. They would love to help you along the way and happily give you the love and affection you deserve. If you dont feel like anyone else in your life loved you except your ex I really recommend finding a club hobby activity church group sport team or a volunteer work. Basically go anywhere where you would interact with people on a weekly basis. I met my now roommate in a church group and even though weve only been friends for a few months she has been so incredibly supportive of me during my breakup.

Sure I still think about him but I dont have that hope that maybe hell change his mind when hes not messaging me telling me he thought about me all day or saying things like you know I love you right?

9663011,0,t1_da3t9jt,So its the third time in writing this message because of my damn phone. Anyway its unbelievable because Ive mentally gone through most of what youve said. I found myself walking around the city and suddenly her thought would come up and tears would force their way out. Ive lost count of how many times I left class for a few minutes just to close myself in the bathroom stall and cry my heart out. About our feelings I think you pretty much said what I think. We cant control what triggers them and the only thing we can do is just limit their impact on our lives and our ability to do what we must. Forcing yourself to feel good is almost impossible. I found I actually managed to do so a few times. Yesterday for example I was at the gym. I had spent the whole day feeling numb and I couldnt stand it anymore. I walked in and I tried to shake it off I moved around I breathed heavily and I told myself not here. Im done with this negativity. Im here to lift some weights and have fun. Fuck these feelings. And it worked. I actually didnt feel sad for the rest of the day. However I was coming from a whole day of pain and sadness so i think my body was just fed up with it all and forcing myself actually worked. Most of the times though all I can actually achieve is feeling defeated by my own momentary feelings...You are absolutely right our mind does play tricks on us. If I gotta be honest though I feel pretty sure shes actually over me. Not because my brain is fooling me. You see when I talked to her friend almost a month and a half ago she told me she had asked her a couple of times if she felt sad. She said she didnt and only felt bad about how I was feeling. When I talked to my ex the last time I could see she was talking as if this thing didnt really effect her profoundly. Sometimes I do think maybe seeing me around with other girls which actually happened today a couple of times may irritate her a bit. But then again Im pretty skeptical. See the problem is that we fight not to fall under illusions of any kind. So we doubt every single clue we may get. We dismiss it as something that doesnt really matter or that didnt really happen. The girl I was walking around today told me my ex her name is Martina btw. Im Italian. walked up to her while she was talking to a mutual friend and when she smiled my ex gave her a freezing look. At first I felt satisfied about this. Sweet sweet revenge right? Well two seconds later I started doubting this really happened. Maybe she just misinterpreted her expression I thought. Martina is a shy person she could have just smiled in a weird discreet way and it might have come off as unpleasant. Even now Im convinced about this. Another example from today I was with the same friend in a little park just outside school. The past years me and Martina used to go there after school to smoke cigarettes together. I was there sharing one with my friend when my ex walked by yes I did know she might have came through that way. When I turned around I think I saw her looking at us and turning her head again. And you know what? To this moment Im still not convinced it really happened. Its like my mind wont make me understand if this was all a dream or if it actually happened. Im actually more convinced she just passed by and didnt even notice me. Unbelievable.Anyway today she saw me a couple of times with this girl and actually a lot of people asked questions even my exs friend. Its understandable since they all saw us pretty close and around town getting coffee shes a pretty cute girl too... were actually really good friends and thats all. I cant lie and say Im not enjoying this. I love that people actually suspect theres something more to it and my friend is actually playing along. Telling people we are just friends only emphasizes their suspicions so I guess theres no real way of convincing them its not what they think. Today when I was about to get out of school we had an institute reunion so we had no classes and we were all free to wander wherever I was walking with this friend towards the door and my ex was there. One of my classmates was between me and her and I saw her moving her head  over his shoulder to catch a glimpse as if she had been looking for me. I looked over and we made eye contact. She realized and broke it off immediately as if she had seen the wrong person. I actually thought she might have been looking for her friend and mistook me as her but thinking about it it sounds a bit ridiculous and unlikely. Did she want to see me and my friend together? I dont know. I shouldnt care either but thats just impossible at the moment.Heres one thing thats hitting me really hard the lack of physical affection. At first this didnt matter at all. I just felt forgotten and left behind. I didnt miss her body I missed her words. Now Im starting to realize many times a day how hard it is to accept I wont be able to kiss her again. To hold her tight under my bed sheets to caress her thighs... the idea that all of this is just gone... and not for a few weeks or a couple of months but forever. Theres never going to be a night Ill spend with her hugging her to sleep. Our last time making love is behind me now. And this hurts. Its not just sexlessness its the reality of having to leave behind someone who you had a great sexual affinity with. She was my first girlfriend and I was the first guy that actually made her feel comfortable about her body and her beauty.To state the obvious theres not a single day that goes by in which I dont wonder if shell ever come back in which I dont daydream about her calling me up a random day or reaching out for Christmas and asking me to meet her... I take a shower and I pretend to be talking to her I tell her all I think and all I feel. I give her one more chance. Will this ever end? Its been two months... I would have never thought it could be this hard. When am I going to be able to look at her walking down the corridors the way I did today and not feel like I need to throw up? When will I see her beautiful cheeks her nose her hair and only be slightly touched by that beauty? I mean isnt it ridiculous that the only time you truly perceive the stunning beauty of your partner is when theyre gone? I now look at her and realize I could write hours straight about how gorgeous she is. Never during my relationship have I felt this stunned by her body... she is amazing and knowing I had the privilege to share intimacy with her is both destructive and uplifting. I still havent gone on that date. School is making stuff hard for the both of us and were waiting to find the right day. Writing this messages makes me feel stronger about what I thought and said in the past. We will come out as winners. One day. Things are surely better still extremely hard and bitter but not as depressing. I managed not to fuck up in school which is a great thing Im only trying not to make it another problem I dont need right now. Thank you for all the support it means a ton.

You will start feeling to overthink what falling out of love means and become more sad and depress. I would say wait at least until you can remember him and not be sad. Dont be a me and try to rush things with your ex. You will find out some stuff you shouldnt have and overact. For me I found out that she lied to me about liking another person. I went crazy and went through her phone to prove myself. Long story short both of us have no trust for each other.Me and my ex were my best friend before we dated and now we are probably never going to talk to each other. All because I still wanted to see her while I was still in pain. If you truly want to stay friends then work on yourself.

9818382,0,t3_5fv47s,Just my two cents but I think you need to continue doing exactly what youre currently doing. You are very fortunate to have had such a clean and amicable breakup.At the same time consider the situation youre both in. If I read it correctly it sounds like she just started college? College is a time to discover who you are and all of that jazz. Some people dont want to be tied down in a relationship during their time there let alone a longdistance one.I think if you have deep enough feelings for this girl you should continue to keep in touch  when youre both ready to of course. Based off of how things sound theres no reason to think you couldnt get back together if the situation allowed it. Please keep in mind that rekindling the relationship is in no way whatsoever a guarantee. As far as giving up too easily it doesnt seem like it to me. Longdistance relationships are extremely difficult to maintain and take a massive amount of effort from both parties. Just like a standard relationship if one party isnt putting in any effort theres not much that can be done.,BreakUps,dancqn0,2,t5_2ra79

You are right college is a time to discover who you are Im still trying to figure out what career I want to pursue and I was already trying to think of a career for the future that would be able to support a family housing etc. and all the logistics and pressure overwhelmed me. Also eventually her and I would either have to move cross country to be together. Were we thinking too far ahead instead of enjoying what was in the present? Maybe just impatient to be with one another? I was so ambitious and so in love that I would do anything to be with her. I thought I would be able to accomplish such a task but now I feel guilty that I was unable to follow through. I do plan to keep in touch as well but how will we know when the time is right? Im afraid that she means we can talk again when we no longer have any feelings for each other. But there are different kinds of love right? Maybe not the romantic kind but the caring and compassionate kind? I guess thats what it could mean? Sorry about the barrage of questions you dont have to answer all ,BreakUps,dapmxit,1,t5_2ra79

Initially things were really hard. I felt like shit for the first two months. Only recently did I realise that itll be alright even thinking about him doesnt make me upset or anything just merely passing thoughts.gt What have you been doing to pass the time each day?School helps a lot. I have also been focusing more on piano catching up with friends who Ive neglected because of the relationship I was attached from age  to  so doing that obviously wasnt the best thing... in general just doing things to please myself! I realised I had been spending so much time trying to salvage what was already dying and being able to spend it back on myself after  years is amazing.gt Have you had any deep  long conversations with anyone that has provided any sort of therapeutic effect for you?Yes I have. Two of my very close friends in particular. One of them got rejected so we both managed to grieve together although the pain is different and that friend is more of a softspoken gentle soul. Friend  on the other hand is more rough and sharp so talking to them makes me wake up and stop brooding. That friend is always brutally honest so I just need a sharp poke sometimes gt Do you have any advice to share?Time really does help. It will take a while before you can get into the pace of things. Just a month hey lets put it in weeks. Just  weeks ago I was melancholic trying to count how many days I was NC and single like as a daily goal kinda thing. I was bitter and pessimistic.

10067093,0,t3_5jwnvz,Tough lesson in life.  We all go though these relationships and wonder wtf after.  Remember that there were signs. Remember that this person didnt communicate. Remember non of it was your fault because it isnt your responsibility to make people happy.  The only fault you should have guilt with is being with someone who wasnt happy with themselves and thinking if we work in the relationship it will get better even if they say it is fine. Go out and date and find people to bring into your life that are full of life and self love.  Find someone to date who is open to communication and self growth. When people stop growing they become lethargic and depressed. They become complacent and bored and cant figure out why life sucks blaming it on others.  They dont do anything about it and are usually looking for new people to infect with their sadness. They open a door to leave because being alone is too hard why he stayed for so long but having someone ready to entertain them in the new relationship is easier.  The blindsided moment comes and they have dealt with their emotions of break up but you havent thinking everything was just fine.... It sucks and is a horrible feeling but it is what it is and sticking around thinking about this person is a waste of time and resources.  Go bring in good healthy people into your life and watch how a new healthy and fun relationship will appear. One that isnt just fine.. one that isnt just an option.,BreakUps,dbjrk7e,4,t5_2ra79
10075505,0,t3_5k2d67,Thanks for sharing. I can relate because looking back on the reasons we drifted apart I can see that I was breeding a longing to be alone that drove some of my relationship damaging behaviour. This realisation helps me when I miss her the most because I can tell myself well this ks what you wanted you should as well enjoy it now. Bit by bit I can feel it coming back and overriding the desperate need to have her back now that she doesnt want me. I guess its just an ego thing really not love anymore. But anyway I try to focus on my newfound freedom and especially the possibility of finally planning moving out of the country. Its an old dream of mine that I kept postponing to wait for her to graduate from law school. I guess we finally realised she didnt really want me waiting around for her since she wasnt even sure she would want to go with me.

Even if you didnt do anything hes still just replaying whatever over and over in his head and hitting the same destructive conclusions.  Leaving him alone will do the same but this would at least free his brain and break it away from you.

Just learn to be confident and throw yourself into situations and youll see that all the good things she saw in you other girls will too. Have fun and get laid itll help. It helped me.

10246269,0,t3_5mpnsk,Look let me start off by saying that supplementing your pain with someone else will not help. My ex and I broke up about  months ago and my first reaction was that I needed the same. So what did I do? I played every single card that I had up my sleeve and tried to find my footing within any relationship I could find. Luckily I failed miserably and wasnt able to pull anything together. Because looking back I was NOT READY. This is truly the longest that I have been single in almost  years and I have learned more about myself in the last  months than I have in the  years that I was in two very serious relationships. Hang in there be with yourself and find out who you are now because I guarantee you that you are not the same person that you were  years ago. Sooner or later youll realize that you have so much to offer and youll owe it to yourself to not give it to someone who doesnt deserve it. ,BreakUps,dc5gz8y,3,t5_2ra79

This one I wan to marry.  I want to be with this last one for life.  Im having the hardest time in my life with this last one.  Ive never pleaded with God for anything.  Now Im doing it every  minutes.  Ive never been truly happy since coming back from Iraq in .  My PTSD was bad is bad.  This is the first time I ever felt actually happy carefree and didnt think about any of the garbage.  She was the one bright spot in my life and I loved being the one in hers.  Something weird happened all of a sudden  weeks ago.  Im not sure what but literally  literally   overnight things changed.  I dot now what happened.  But I want her back no I need her back.  We were the perfect couple.  Seriously.  We could finish each others sentences.  It was weird but awesome.  I never had this kind of connection with anyone in my life.  We didnt have sex.  We made love.  Even the first time was like we were always meant to.  When we were together from the first day on she and I both said it was like weve always been together.  Its just so hard to think of letting go.  I just dont know what to do.  I just want her back.  I wish and hope she would feel the same.  God I need her back.,BreakUps,dc6d4d0,2,t5_2ra79

How you could continue to be with someone knowing theres no future. Whats the point. He said we make each other happy.Anyway he came over. We talked. Everything went back to normal.

She probably cares about talking with the guy so she wouldnt just stop talking to him. If she cared more about you than she cared about him the choice was obvious.I dont think its a matter of insecurity or anything.

I had car troubles for a month and that may be one of the reasons she left me but I got a new car thats nicer and faster than hers a week later lol. Yeah I didnt buy her flowers all the time but I did take her out a lot and get her some small gifts. Maybe all girls appreciate it but Im sure you couldve done something for Valentines Day it sounds like she broke up with you before it. Its the thought that counts. I always held doors open for her all the time I would open the car door for her I would always switch the side Im walking on just so she wouldnt be on the outside and other things. She was lactose intolerant and I always made sure to carry lactaid pills for her whenever we went out. Is this something that may be normal for guys to do? Maybe. But she recognized it and almost everyone will and see that you are a gentleman.You cant sit there and dwell on it and wish you did things differently. If she felt you didnt put enough effort in why couldnt she speak with you about it? Its done and over with but now you can use what youve learned on the next girl. If you scored one super pretty girl you are bound to do it again. There are a lot of beautiful girls that Im only friends with but at one point we did talk or mess around and then decided it was better to just be friends. This means that I could very well meet other beautiful girls. You can too and you will.Dont worry about sounding like a simp a few weeks ago I was just sitting there pouring my heart out to these girls I know. They were supportive but probably thought it was pathetic haha. I was in a pretty bad place. This is why I like to offer to talk to anyone if they want because sometimes your friends and family get annoyed by it after a while.With all of your free time and money now you will feel better eventually.

Its honestly cowardly because they are too scared to end it so they manipulate your emotions. Makes me mad just thinking about it but they showed their true colors who needs POS like that??,BreakUps,df6v7oa,6,t5_2ra79

11309217,0,t3_61dmxn,You had it spot on when you said that he is never there for you when you need him but expects you to be there for him in the voids between his new girlfriends. You are totally dependent on him and I get that. For a  year period I was dependent and obsessed with a guy I knew was not good for me was probably seeing other people and I knew there was no future with him. It made me anxious paranoid jealous I couldnt sleep. I hated the person I had become. So I moved away from him and blocked him from my life entirely until I was strong enough without him that I just didnt care. Why do you put him on a pedestal just because he is good looking. He has treated you and probably many other women along the way horribly. You have to really see him for what he is. He is not this perfect guy whos going to suddenly realise you are the one he wants. Because in all honesty he never will. He clearly has no respect for you because he knows that whatever he says or does to you he can treat you like shit and you would still take him back. It shows you dont respect yourself so why should he?! Its time to stand up for yourself do something worthwhile that makes you realise how amazing you are and that he doesnt have the right to treat you like this anymore!

11476387,0,t1_dfvzfn0,Thank you reading my wall of text and responding. Those are good thoughts. I have come to realize that the reason I acted the way I did is because I feel I did not have a safe avenue to express my concerns. She is not the best listener gets annoyed at my feelings when I express myself disregards them etc. I am the opposite I try to listen as best I can and improve. I think that not feeling safe with so many feelings led to my regrettable action.,BreakUps,dfwuegr,1,t5_2ra79

She doesnt need you to make a movie with her she needs you to leave her alone because the relationship wounded her badly enough that she decided she was better off without you.You should be thinking about your involvement in the break up and what you did that was wrong and you should be focusing on fixing those negative traits in your personality.,BreakUps,dg31a4w,3,t5_2ra79

11592422,0,t3_65eimm,Friends dont have agendas. Its not to say that you cant be friends with your ex once you end the relationship. But its not only impossible but highly unwise to do so until the spectre of the previous relationship has faded to the point that youre able to begin a legitimate platonic friendship anew.The problem is that being friends is usually just the thin end of the wedge to get the parties back into a pseudorelationship of sorts. Stay strong! ,BreakUps,dga0cen,1,t5_2ra79
11594549,0,t1_dga56ub,There is no perfect partner. Theres no perfect person! But when you love someone when you want to be in their life you dont give up. Youre right reality is chaotic. It tests partnerships. Life is messy. Those who can figure out how to get through it stay together. Sometimes it doesnt work. But definitely you shouldnt wait around for any person. You gotta move on. Our exes chose to move on so we have to too. ,BreakUps,dga916h,2,t5_2ra79

11614490,0,t3_65qz63,Im six months out of a . year relationship. I didnt get time to heal as he kept contacting me and more while he was already in a new relationship.Now shes pregnant theyre almost five months together shes  weeks pregnant and he doesnt want anything to do with me.All my hope got destroyed with one word Yes after I asked him if she was. Thirtheen years of fighting and she gets it within two months. You need to let everything go if you really want to move on. I still had hope and never truly wanted to. Now Im forced to. I know its devestating. It really is. The pain is unbareable. Everything reminds you of the other one. Put all her belongings in a bag or box just out of sight. God knows it doesnt work that way for me to forget him but it might for you. I hope you are stronger than me I wish you all the luck. Youre not alone.,BreakUps,dgcigk2,4,t5_2ra79
11696831,0,t3_66wozp,Completely normal. My relationship ended because of something I did. I was very insecure and jealous. He couldnt handle that and he left. I took responsibility for my actions that lead to the breakup and forgave myself. It was the first step toward healing for me figuring out what I did wrong in the relationship. Once I figured it out I knew I needed to change that about myself so I did. Once I made the change I was able to forgive myself for my wrong doing and found myself more settled and content with the breakup.We all go through the phase especially after time has passed where we can only remember the good parts of the relationship. That is because our brain loves us and wants to protect us. It doesnt want us dwelling on the bad cuz it knows we need to remember good times to survive. So once again it is completely normal and I would say everyone has the rose colored glasses phase when going through a breakup. ,BreakUps,dglurgh,3,t5_2ra79
11718001,0,t1_dgo8klr,Thank you for taking the time to read my post and responding. I really appreciate it. Ive been moping about all day with no one to turn to because Im still in denial that this happened. I keep hoping that hell come in with a grand gesture of flowers saying that hes sorry and that hell do better next time... but then so goes the cycle right?Hes staying in the guest bedroom for now and I think Ill end up moving out since most of the furniture is his. I told him that I would help him find someone to sublease if he wanted to move out too. Hes still my friend and in the end I think we were just that to each other so its really not much of a difference. Im going to miss being in someones embrace at night. For now I guess Ill hug my dog for comfort. ,BreakUps,dgo9j3x,1,t5_2ra79

11803230,0,t3_68ev5n,Dude that guy does not respect you at all. If he did he wouldve respected your relationship and left it alone. I know with Tinder etc its easy to meet people quickly but to jump in a relationship after  days sounds to me like there was some seeds already planted before you two broke up. She more than likely kept you so secretive because either she didnt want the new guy knowing about you or if he did she wanted to see how things went with him.,BreakUps,dgxxqwn,11,t5_2ra79
