6384203,0,t1_czf07wa,I actually tried to revisit the Elfstones book after seeing the first couple episodes of the show because a lot of what I saw on screen wasnt how I remembered it at all. It turns out they rewrote quite a lot of the details. The names are the same but you can tell they tried to cram everything into even simpler archetypal stereotypes cutting out a lot of the subtlety and mystery that I thought made the source interesting and compelling. I originally read those books in my early teens though so Im talking from a position of  years of nostalgia. Thats a pretty difficult bar for a TV show to live up to.,shannarachronicles,czfbd9j,2,t5_398pb

10657506,0,t1_ddf5qy1,Np I was glad to get any news and was really worried. Due to something a forum member whos very familiar with the books mentioned. The story always moves ahead generationally maybe two. It could have meant we would lose all the characters we care about except Allanon.,shannarachronicles,ddf8nmz,3,t5_398pb
