6556929,0,t1_czxh5v8,OMG....I think I solved part of it!!!Notice how some of them have diagonal exits and some straight? I think this teaches you which way to orient them! If you overlapped a few panels the straight exits are where they would need to be if it were to continue from one diamond down to the next. Notice how there are twice as many with the straight exit? Thats exactly how they would need to be if they were to be three sets  two sets with straight and the one set with diagonal at the bottom. That adds up perfectly!Now overlay all of the diagonal ones on top of each other and focus on the breaks. Break off any path thats broken in any of the four. What you have left....has exactly one viable path through it. And it DOES fit in a x grid! Now the thing is its one square longer that a x grid....but maybe that helps you figure out the orientation of the other ones! ,TheWitness,czxjgn3,0,t5_2u3f5

6661742,0,t3_46wqyc,Some reasoning that obviously gets progressively more spoilery. The long piece is exactly the height of the puzzle so it has  possible positions each column of the puzzle. We can narrow down to two of those positions because the long piece cant go in either of the middle columns because then the other two pieces wont fit at the sides. So the long piece has to go either in column  or column .. Given the above two points the two Lshaped pieces are going to have to fit into a  high  wide space together. Theres only two possible ways they can do that.. Weve now narrowed it down to  possible solutions  if you try them youll find that that only one will be possible to draw and still reach the end without having to cross over yourself.,TheWitness,d08dqlw,4,t5_2u3f5

6809922,0,t3_490j0y,MY  cents...I would treat them as ENTIRELY different types of puzzle games. They dont have a terrible amount in common other than some of the discovery aspects. The puzzle design isnt nearly as elegant as The Witness by any means but it can get equally as clever at times. I would compare Talos more to Portal overall but many of the puzzles have multiple solutions and can get very convoluted which can be good or bad depending on how you look at it. For me some of the later puzzles couldve been honed in more designwise to make them only work the intended way. If you liked finding the environment puzzles then youll probably enjoy figuring out solutions to the special star puzzles throughout the game. They can require some SERIOUSLY weird and lateral thinking and they were overall a semifrustrating fantastic time to figure out....just like The Witness! DThere are a TON of fun secrets and Easter eggs to find but dont expect every little thing that looks meaningful to literally be meaningful.  Thats where it differs the most I think. Some parts can be more of a literal Easter egg hunt than a well directed puzzle. The story is actually where it stands out. It has its share of philosophical audio logs but nothinggnearly as pretentious as the ones in The Witness. The storyline actually has some close similarities to a certain survival horror game that I wont give away unless you want to know. TLDRPlay it!  Its great!!,TheWitness,d0o79jr,13,t5_2u3f5

6995323,0,t3_4bhw29,I dont but its a good question. I think the best candidates would be the town obelisk for the environmental puzzles that use the black walls because you do them from a high place were you can see the obeliskspoiler. the lake obelisk there are two environmental puzzles that use the cliff below the obeliskspoiler and one that use a pipe near the quarry bridgespoiler all of which allow you to see the obelisk when you solve them. the monastery obelisk although none of them allow you to see the obelisk while you solve them there are a lot of environmental puzzles here and the obelisk is very easy to see. the mountain obelisk maybe you can see it well enough when you solve the river environmental puzzle from the top of the mountainspoiler. At least it would allow you to see that from abovespoiler.For the two remaining puzzles I dont think its possible unless you see the one near the treehouses from the top of the keeps tower? Also the ones with the windmill can be done from almost everywhere in the island so maybe you can find a place where you can solve them and still see the symmetrydesert obelisk?That would make a nice challenge to actually see ALL obelisks turn white during a same game ,TheWitness,d199h4m,1,t5_2u3f5

Each light box that is lit represents an activated laser. Each fountain that shoots upward represents a completed obelisk. Each open clam represents a completed video location puzzle. Each leaf represents the location of a discarded triangle panel. The leaf turns darker once youve completed it. Flowers represent audio log locations. Bloomed flowers show youve found it.
