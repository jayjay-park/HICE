2696047,0,t1_cna85zd,Thanks for the answer.As for why One copy is stored locally on my desktops internal HDD and the other is on an external drive that I use on multiple computers. My media playback situation is in flux right now I have a WD TV which usually has two external HDDs connected via USB. I have a desktop which I just installed Kodi on and am trying to configure to my liking. I have two laptops one of which has Plex installed and the other has no media server software because I dont store or play media from it.I have no idea how long my media situation will be in such a mess  my file organization is perfectly fine so Im not in any hurry to make any major changes like nixing my WD TV or ditching local playback to go allin on streaming. So avoiding listed duplicates seemed like the best way to keep my desktops Kodi library organized for the immediate future.,kodi,cnahqfx,1,t5_32uhe

3829869,0,t3_34a9p8,Welcome to the wonderful world of Kodi.  Just a forewarning those streaming addons arent sanctioned and arent well viewed in this sub.  Also talking about them will get your posts deleted on kodi.tv.  tvaddons.ag is your best bet for this discussion.  Kodi is a media center program designed from the ground up to be used to play your own personal library of legally obtained material.  So anything beyond that pear to pear streaming unsubscribed or fraudulently obtained live streams and illegal on demand streams arent viewed well here.That said most of what Im about to say isnt viewed well on in other places either so Ill say it here.  Ive tried many possibly even all of the live TV addons they dont work well.  If they do they wont in a week or two.  You can chase your tail for weeks trying to keep up with them but for me its just not worth it.  If you want local channels and networks get an HD antenna.  rcordcutters has a ton a great info start with the side bar and any stickied posts.As for the rest of the addons you listed Genesis is light years ahead of the rest just stick to that.  Ive heard that S.A.L.T.S can access a wider range of material incase you come across something you cant find in Genesis but Ive yet to need it.Personally I use Genesis Netflix PBS and PBS kids.  And the reality is most of my content comes from Netflix.  For  a month its worth it.,kodi,cqsu5qg,6,t5_32uhe

4300671,0,t1_cs8a2rx,Why is it so damn hard for people to understand that we dont give a shit if you use Kodi to WATCH or ORGANIZE pirated content? Thats fine. More power to you. However being able to work with pirated content is nothing more than just being able to work with any content. It doesnt help you obtain those videos. You make the choice yourself to get those videos. Were just playing them.You seem to think were trying to make some moral statement and that has nothing at all to do with any of this. Theres no difference in the code about how Kodi plays back legally owned files and pirated files. Were neither for nor against piracy. We are the Sweden of your video activity.So fuck you for saying that Kodi is for piracy. You really showed us how were being so disrespectful to you by saying Kodi doesnt download pirated content. Its so irritating to try and protect an open source project and the people who work on it from legal difficulties or even being shut down. Im soooo sorry.You fucking cunt.,kodi,csaervt,3,t5_32uhe

Thats what you want if your source is in one of the compatible DDDTS formats. The DDDTS capable options force your computer to decode the . signal when the sound bar cant. I cant say exactly what your computer is doing with the signal but its responsible for the difference in volume.Unless you want to manage the decoding yourself which is a valid choice you should probably leave those options set to enabled. As long as your source files are in one of the compatible formats that is. ,kodi,cy1r46e,3,t5_32uhe

7307221,0,t1_d28qe4z,Indeed it got much better over the years. No hiccups since last summer I believe. I wouldnt say it works  of the time probably a bit less than that but overall from one day to the next it just works fine for me  scrobbling aside as I use an external player in Kodi so I just setup the .xml to flag an episode as watched in Kodi after  min playback on the external player and then Trakt picks up on that just fine. One detail though the Trakt plugin autoupdates on Kodis launch in my setup right after Kodi updates its library so in case theres a misflag I can correct it before its pushed online but for some reason if an episode is already watched in Trakt then I set it as unwatched in Kodi it doesnt really work in Trakt as it seems to think you cant unwatch something... and usually just flags said episode as watched upon the next update. So Trakt is fine for the first viewing shall we say but after that you cant really work with unwatched status to rewatch something with a friend for instance. Have to check history on the trakt db ok we saw x last night lets fire up x.Its really a lifesaver overall though as you can nuke any localLAN install without a second thought and you can also just browse the trakt.tv website to keep up with new stuff etc. just another way to do it,kodi,d28s4y7,2,t5_32uhe

9167531,0,t1_d8e1mmd,....right by using a passthrough. I have the Moto Droid I tried the custom hotword thing for a while. Its  IMHO of course  terrible. For one youre limited in what you can choose I wanted something as simple as Hey Samantha and it could never pick it up because it was too short andor the voice training was bad. For another it then has to pass whatever request you make TO google its not the native Google Assistant app actually listening to you. That creates a delay. Third its not available on every phone. Its available on the Moto line and maybe one or two more  and again its not a native google function. Thats a big deal. So the fact that it wont natively be available on the Home is definitely a mark against it in my opinion. It needs to be baked into the Assistant it needs to be  customizable and it needs to be voicetrainable to minimize or completely eliminate false positives.

This wont be the last issue you run into via MySQL so lets solve that next problem... by never running into it. For what its worth Ive used MySQL as a database for about eight years.

10781106,0,t3_5u7kvs,Only way I could get Kodi or spmc to work with Chromecast is mirroring. Would really love if either one would support CC directly but it doesnt seem to be a priority for them. I never cast the browser. I only use mirroring or direct CC support with the icon. Dont see why you need it in a browser? ,kodi,ddrzqx0,1,t5_32uhe

Then scroll down to the Kodi folder and copy the entire folder to the same location on your new computer. This can also be done on Android by navigating to Androiddataorg.xbmc.kodifiles and copying the .kodi folder to the same location on another android device.  I recently purchased a second Nvidia Shield and used the above method to easily copy the exact same setup I have on my first Shield. Worked fantastic.,kodi,ddxk1zc,1,t5_32uhe

11135498,0,t1_detx33l,gt As far as dev and pirate crossover at least as regards to pirate streaming addons Im not aware that that is the case. Nobody on the team uses pirate streamsI didnt mean only the team I meant the larger collection of developers who make the plethora of additional functionality via official addons. There are devs who make clean addons that also work on the dark side that is certain. Not going to name names but they are out there. There is no hard line when it comes to that. There are actually plenty of banned addons that have nothing to do with piracy but everything to do with interdev disputes and rules lawyering in the forums.,kodi,deu74rn,1,t5_32uhe

It will allow you to sideload a launcher version of the Kodi and bypass amazons screen but is a bit more involved.Easier is to simple choose the APk you desire  either spmc or Kodis official android apk  enable developer mode on the fire tv and side load via adb. Keep the skin light so the skin doesnt bog down  confluence or amber whats also nice about fire tv is that you have a native Netflix app... so you can actually favorite the app in Kodi. And then put it on your menu and when you click it auto magically goes to the native app.Any questions let me know ,kodi,dfktbf1,1,t5_32uhe

11547137,0,t1_dg4uvoy,gt Now if we take these same clueless netflix subscribers not you guys and your bitrate loving asses and tell them about netflix and kodi integration you dont think a good chunk of them will learn about pirate addons and switch to save  bucks?I dont think so unless they have someone helping them. This stuff breaks there are things like RealDebrid paying for that with Bitcoin making the addon easier to use by customizing the skin etc.These addons may provide lots of content but there are lots of things they do not do. They do not generally showcase content the ratings and recommendations system are not very slick Trakt user get lost very easily.Then there is dealing with addons that torrent files setting up VPNs being frustrated by weird errors dealing with log files and asshole internet forum users on and on and on.Netflix and Hulu have none of these issues.Having these addons easily integrate into Kodi allows Kodi to be setup by manufacturers on smart TVs set top boxes media centered laptops and computers things like that. The user never need deal with any other interface than the Kodi menu to access all their stuff. Its a lot easier for the manufacturers to not have to make their own interface when there is a semistandard one people can get used to.,kodi,dg4vcg4,1,t5_32uhe
