2695652,0,t1_cna9l86,I would not recommend the iron gym pull up bar.  You will leave black marks on the frame which can be a pain to get out if you are renting.  I ended up cutting up a white tshirt to cover the parts that touch the frame and that worked well.I recently upgraded to the Perfect Pull up bar and really like it.  I can do wide grip now which I couldnt before.  The foam on the front of the frame offers good protection but I am still using a tshirt to cover the back bar.  Also the construction is more heavy duty than the iron gym was and it is a similar price.  ,coolguides,cnafvj5,3,t5_310rm

4825624,0,t1_cu2s3ix,Well the myths are just that myths.  Most people who actively follow Asatru Odinism and any other religion based off the Norse myths do not believe the myths to be literal but metaphors.   That said like some Christians believe the bible is  accurate there are also some Pagans who believe the myths are  literal but in my opinion they are the minority.  The myths are filled with stories like this and most of the myths involving Loki involve him doing something to mess with the Gods gets in a lot of trouble then does something outrageous to make amends. Most of the time coming back with the items that made the Gods great.  Thors hammer and belt Odins Spear Sleipnir and the gold ring that always multiplies.  Freyr received Gullinbursti the bore and Skblanir the ship that could be folded up into a pocket.  Just to name a few.  Loki was a trickster always getting himself into trouble but most of the time doing something great to atone for what he did.  Its a story about how something great can some from something terrible.  Its a metaphor. You cant look at the myths as  literal or it will drive you crazy.  As for this particular story the horse was doing  of the work.  Had Loki killed the horse the Giant could have retaliated.  By distracting the horse in the best way possible he made sure the work would not be completed the Giant would have to honor his word and they would at least get a mostly finished wall.   Its a story about doing what you need to do even if it is not the most pleasant thing to do.  ,coolguides,cu2t558,2,t5_310rm

So your way is only a bit slower but it also creates an inconsistent inferior product.Doing it differentlyapproximating every time also means you cant figure out the exact ratio you prefer whereas if you make it in batches and experiment youll eventually figure out if you like it with    etc sriracha. Figuring that out is a pain sure but its a personalized recipe youll be using for probably decades afterwards.Of course a lot of this does depend on exactly how many sauces you like.

9677317,0,t1_da5xl56,TLDR  Type in  for proper formattingActual replyFor the      like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out     which will turn out like this The reason for this is that the underscore character this one   is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy  .  Since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy  .  The backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display.  So your first  is just saying hey I dont want to italicize  so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character.  After this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing I know.  Anyways I guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lolCAUTION Probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep.Edit The reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize.  Reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again.  For example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize.  Since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them.  So technically you could have written  but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore.  You would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice.  If you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize.  To show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized.,coolguides,da5xl9l,2,t5_310rm

It is only the part where she is described as good that is the biased part. The rest could be good reporting.Same thing if you pop up with a story that says that Hillary is bad and then describes the clinton foundation and who gives them money. It is only the Hillary is bad part that is the biased part. The rest could be good.CNN might be comment heavybias heavy but the story itself is rarely false. But as we have learned in this election extra comment after a story can shape the story by damping the impact or obfuscating the meaning.I think people have become so dependent on a conclusion in the articles instead of just be given the information and then to make up your own conclusion that biased news becomes bad news. You almost have to train yourself to recognise the bias.But wikileaks has a different problem where the source giver is anonymous meaning that you cant really know if the information given has been tampered with or who is sending it. Dont get me wrong when Hillary leaks got leaked then everyone was more focused on who leaked it instead of focusing on what was leaked. But also now there is the problem of seeing if something has been planted. The person leaking the information could want to ether just show us horrible stuff or use misinformation to move an opinion and Hillary could want to mark the really bad stuff as misinformation and then get off free of guilt.,coolguides,dcvrpdc,2,t5_310rm

I have discussed the genre in length before on this subreddit  allow me to copy amp paste. Vaporwave is an electronic music genre originating in the early s characterized by a surrealist fascination with entertainment and corporate advertisement this is because the music originated as an anticapitalistic statement. It typically includes samples from lounge music elevator music smooth jazz and other popular tunes. As per the Wikipedia article on the subject gt Artists often embrace classical sculpture web design capitalism lowpoly computer renderings glitch art VHS recordings cassette tapes Japanese art and cyberpunk tropes.Within the album art and music videos the musicians and artists intend to create a distinct aesthetic and this aesthetic has become a staple of the genre. The music is commonly chopped altered and otherwise layered to create an almost distorted and ambient sound. Popular examples of Vaporwave include Macintosh Pluss Floral Shoppe and Fluences Elemental.,coolguides,dd1j37u,26,t5_310rm

11081865,0,t1_denmjzc,Well if you did watch professionals youd see how often the cue ball pops straight up in the air on the break because the ideal break leaves the cue ball in the center of the table. A proper break would not absolutely not need to rebreak the balls even more because a solid hit would spread the balls in the first place. Center of the rack with slight low english to get the ball sliding when it makes contact in on the center of the head ball to leave the most angles available is classic pool wisdom and pretending a somewhat unorthodox strategy that is based around the idea that youre going to have a poor break that doesnt spread the balls to begin with and will increase chance of scratching is somehow maximizing power  is misleading. While good form would remove cue raising issues it is also fairly obvious that this is intended for people who do not yet know how to break properly and a closed break is a frequent recommendation for those who struggle with a level stroke. And especially for an introductory guide like this is it obvious a break to scatter the balls properly is going to be the aim while nonstandard breaks that dont hit head on are typically for specific reason like in Ball for example where a breaker may often shoot to get the  ball in the side pocket. This guide is actually very good containing most of the useful tips minus inaccuracies about where to place the cue ball and how to hold the cue on the break.,coolguides,deo4bb5,1,t5_310rm
