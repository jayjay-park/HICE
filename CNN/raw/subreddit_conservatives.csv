The average salary at Walmart is .hour.So if we were to raise that to hour  which is what they are asking for that would cost . million....except salary is not all there is to having employees.

We chose to throw certain people in jail for certain crimes and look past other crimes committed by other people.  For instance there is pretty good evidence that the last  presidents all used illegal drugs committing felonies but because they committed those felonies on college campuses or in suburban homes no one was interested in catching and prosecuting them.

They knew they had a problem and tried to do it themselves but needed help.Im not saying to legalize driving while intoxicated. I would say we should take an approach to drugs similar to that of Colorados approach to cannabis. Its legal to buy have and use in private. Its not legal to operate a vehicle while intoxicated.My point is not that prison doesnt ever work in reforming peoples behavior. My point is that we shouldnt be locking people in prison over drugs. We should divert the absurd amounts of money we devote to enforcing drug laws and imprisoning nonviolent drug offenders to voluntary drug rehab programs. Thats a much more effective way to spend the money.gtabsolutely within the realm of the CongressWhile I disagree with the judicial expansion of the interstate commerce clause to regulate drug sales that never pass state borders I do recognize that it grants Congress the power to do so. I thought that my saying has no business clearly implied that I meant shouldnt. I also said serious crimes to imply that I dont think possession ingestion etc. are actions worthy of being labeled as criminal. I dont mean to insult you but you seem to have neglected your reading comprehension skills.gtbecause they fried too many drug cellsYou seem to be implying that you think we should punish the people who only harm themselves with their drug use using the people who harm others as a justification for doing so. By that I mean you seem to think that we should punish all drug users so that we can punish those who harm other people. I strongly disagree with that notion. You might as well say we should ban all guns and imprison gun owners just because a few idiots shoot people whether intentionally or not. Better yet lets allow some guns pharmaceuticals but lets ban assault rifles and fully automatic guns cannabis cocaine LSD etc. because those dont have any acceptable uses.Banning drugs and imprisoning the users hasnt stopped the people around the users from getting hurt. You need to realize that legalizing or at least decriminalizing drugs does not equate to condoning drug use. Doing so only acknowledges that the methods weve used in the drug war havent been effective.gtWhen you are addicted to a substance that is no longer a choice if it was you wouldnt need rehab centers.Getting help with your addiction is the choice. Doing drugs in the first place was a choice. Its not the governments place to be making these life choices for people. If those people choose to use drugs then become addicted and choose not to seek help thats tragic but its their decision.gtHave you ever been into a NICU Neonatal ICU unit. I worked at a hospital years ago and had to go in the NICU a few times for tech support. More than half of the babies in their were premature and addicted to crack.I wont dismiss your anecdote. Ill plainly acknowledge that babies born into addiction represent a real problem. The solution however is healthcare. We need to get everyone insured and we need to provide rehab assistance to pregnant women who are addicted to drugs. This is a health issue not a legal one.gtIf you break the law you are a real criminal.Speeding is against the law. Id hardly call someone who travels one mile per hour above the speed limit a real criminal.gtAs far as the overcrowding is concerned execute the prisoners on death row and those convicted of murder. Stiffen the penalties of other crimes so that hopefully a would be criminal would think twice before committing a crime.I really dont want to get into a debate on the death penalty but the government shouldnt be killing its citizens when theyre incarcerated and no longer a threat to the public. Some crimes may never be forgiven but we should always allow criminals the opportunity to atone and make reparations.As for stiffening the penalties we have hard data that show that thats ineffective. We need only look to the death penalty again to see that its not a deterrent.gtDealing drugs and drug use is not victimless.Thats not at all what Ive been saying. What Ive been saying is that we can address these problems through more effective means than incarceration. The drug war has been a complete and utter failure. It has served only to line the pockets of policing agencies and dealers on the black market get a whole lot of cops and innocent bystanders killed and lock away people who only harm themselves.

5453838,0,t3_3pr9mw,I heard The Judge on Fox and Friends on the commute in this morning. He pointed out that she is under oath and if she lies she commits a crime. Because of this how you phrase the questions matters. If you give her wiggle room and let her express opinion or divert then the hearing gets nowhere. The way he phrased these questions is very deliberate. In the question you state a fact and then have her say either yes no or lie. There is no wiggle room. He stressed that the person asking her the questions should have prosecution experience and knowledge of the facts such as to pin her down and minimize wiggle room.Running directly counter to what The Judge suggests in the questions is the usual pattern of a Senator trying to hog the spotlight and make sound bites with overly long questions that really ask very little or prompt her for opinion.I would really like to see one of the members take one for the team give up his chance to bloviate in the spotlight and actually pin her wormy hide with tough legal questions.,conservatives,cw8s33v,2,t5_2qj2e

Are we ever certain of economic models before we push forward with economic policies? I dont think Ive ever seen gt agreement from economists about any economic policy. So why do we need  certainty in AGW before we do something about it?My argument here is that even if AGW has only a  probability of being true the most rational response is still to mitigate the risk of AGW. It is predicted to be an issue by the top people in the field so we should at least heed their warning and proceed with caution. If their warnings are overblown we will have spent a few billionyear improving our energy efficiency and clean energy technology.

They give this to people at the low end of the economic ladder with a sliding subsidy.Even if you accept the premise the government serves the public good by taking money from the productive and giving it to the unproductive a better way to encourage work would be to give all people regardless of income say month. Then if you do nothing you get . But if you work you get to keep some of that money and still get the .

Recently he underwent a GOP conversion and lifelong views have evolved.Here is Trump on squashing the press and the st amendment As you can see this is a recent position espoused while he was candidate.On the nd amendment we have his evolved position that differs from his long held previous views that some gun restrictions are good The whole assault weapons ban is a real problem because just what is an assault weapon is up for grabs and as far as I can tell anything that looks scary counts as an assault weapon. Under this assault weapons ban pistols would count as semiautomatic weapons It was a piece of crap legislation that Trump supported.Now I fully understand that people routinely are ignorant on a wide array of topics and change their minds upon education. It is good when this happens. What bothers me about flip flops is if I think the flip flop is purely for political posturing and not actually deeply held. I am somewhat reassured by Trumps past support for the nd amendment but his support of the AWB is problematic. It is clearly infringing upon the right of the people to keep and bear arms and should not have been allowed and I think Trump was going on emotion rather than A understanding here. This fuzzy knowledge of the constitution gives me no faith he will adhere to it.But the st amendment statements I showed above are very troubling. These words come out of Trumps own mouth not that of the speaker before him. Cranking down on the free press is the first thing a tyrant does and this is a yuge warning sign. Again it shows a fundamental lack of knowledge or support for the Constitution with Trump going with emotion first to his own detriment.Trumps central value this campaign has been to bring difficult issues to the spotlight.

8808084,0,t1_d761suf,I was talking with a guy taking nuclear engineering right now and I have talked with guys who work at the NRC. The big problem right now is that our aging nuclear power plants are not very safe. There are improved modern versions which are much safer. The ones in Japan that failed during the earthquake were very old and I think were on the slate for replacement with a modern design which would have had no problems during that earthquake.The thing is the environmental movement has been so intractable that there is a lot of political pressure to not do anything with the existing nuclear power plants. So they get older and they get more dangerous. Some of the horror stories I have heard....we really should get these plants updated with modern reactors.We talked some on thorium reactors which I think is a game changer. Thorium is a common occurring slightly radioactive material. You hit it with neutrons and it goes to U which reacts. The reactor vessel flushes out the reaction byproducts so if something goes wrong it fails safe. I think the entire cooling system you need for standard fission is greatly diminished as there is no need to try and contain an out of control reaction. Standard uranium has a mix of U and U and only the U is used. Also the ratio is more U to U so the efficiency is not so good. The reaction itself will stop complete U consumption as well. Thorium is going to need a bunch of RampD to take it to actual use but the hurdles here are doable and not nearly as difficult as fusion.,conservatives,d76m16w,1,t5_2qj2e

9079532,0,t1_d82w6a4,gt This will lead to less American products being sold overseas and you hurt the very people youre trying to save.Have you paid attention to the fact that the US trade balance has been heavily negative since the early s?It isnt  anymore.  The things we export are already being taken over by other countries.gt And we know from history that if we raise tariffs on foreign products our trading partners will raise tariffs on our products like in the s. Again products change but the options left to our trading partners has not.Again this is not the s we are losing our export markets anyway.  Tariffs cant hurt what is already gone.gt But lets deal with the heart of your question What happens when the company decides to manufacture overseas? or as you put it and then what?gt A person becomes available in the labor market to either seek out new employment retrain or reeducate to find new employment or start hisher own business. If you would like we can discuss the most effective ways of doing that. Perhaps its better emphasizing STEM while also promoting skilled labor jobs like plumbing or HVAC repair. These jobs are far less easy to export.With the exception of a very few highlyskilled and some unskilled labor it doesnt matter what someone is trained in.  Were exporting all those jobs.Companies are either offshoring STEM jobs or importing cheap foreign labor on them on HB and L visas.  I work in a highly technical job for a Fortune  company.   years ago there were  US citizen employees with my job title.  Now there are .  Most of the positions were offshored a couple were given to lowercost foreign workers imported to the US.  Maybe those  US employees can find other jobs in their field maybe not.  Maybe they should take a pay cut and train as skilled labor to make Air Conditioners.  ...oops Carrier just moved to Mexico.  Maybe they can retrain as HVAC repairmen.  So... who pays them to repair air conditioners when everyone else is out of work and no one can afford to pay them?gt We cannot selfsustain ourselves so we have to trade.Actually with the exception of a few raw materials not found in the US we can sustain ourselves.gt When we jack up the taxes on foreign products you first cut down the options that our customers have here at home. The only option unemployed people have is to go without.  It doesnt matter if there is a wide variety of cheap products they cant buy.gt As long as there are customers in this country there will be things they want and need.That is exactly the point I am trying to drive home.  The one thing that is required for someone to be a customer is that they have money to spend.  Unemployed people have no money to spend and are thus not customers.gt First Id ask why is it more expensive to produce them here?We have a higher standard of living and pay higher compensation to our workers.  Yes taxes regulatory costs and unions are exacerbating factors  but if all those were removed we would still be more expensive due to higher compensation.  The only way to address that is by eliminating the minimum wage.  Then we could rival the standard of living of rural China.gt Were an exceptional marketplace because for the most part the government has been fairly hands off and allowed people to innovate and try new thingsproducts....and when too few people are employed to buy the products the companies that make them will market them elsewhere.  It doesnt really affect them.  It makes a big deal to those of us who will remain after.gt Thank you for providing citations. Its a shame I no longer trust Breitbart but cest la vie. BLS is still solid.Good.  The Breitbart article is using BLS data also.gt There could be any number of reasons for US company starts are slowing and have slowed. Yep.  It seems obvious that US firms being undercut by foreign competition and cheaper foreign goods and services would have a lot to do with that.gt The recovery of the rest of the modern world could have led to more and stiffer competition but it also allowed people to crawl out of a war torn Europe and Asia and live in relative comfort. Do you see that as a bad thing?I. Dont. Care. About. The. Rest. Of. The. World.With regard to this issue my primary concern is that I my family my friends my neighbors and my countrymen continue to have gainful employment and be able to maintain a high standard of living.  Period.  End of Story.  If the rest of the world cant do that that is their problem.gt The creation of the EPA under the Nixon administration as well as price controls and any number of big government actions could have discouraged entrepreneurs. Access to credit and startup capital is always a struggle but were still feeling the tight credit market effects left by the Great Recession. With low interest rates its difficult to justify lending when there is still so much uncertainty in economy.The tumble has been going on since the late s  long before the Great Recession.  Weve been importing cheap goods and services that compete directly with US companies and that has been accelerating.gt gt But if tax and regulatory costs were zero we would still be more expensive than most of the rest of the world.gt Id love to see your source on this claim.Do you really think that real estate and labor costs combined with local tax and regulatory costs are more expensive in rural China or Vietnam or pick your offshoring country of choice are more expensive than real estate and labor costs alone here?gt But again there are reasons why a company may invest in a country especially the US. Access to infrastructure a fairly well educated work force predictable rule of law etc.All of those things are available much less expensively in other countries than the US.  Ive seen offshoring to India the Czech Republic and Poland for exactly those things.  We dont have a monopoly on them and arent even competitive.gt Then the free market does what it always does. Creates a new product or service that people want or dont know they want....but the market isnt changing.  People still want the same things.  What is changing is where those things are made and the ability of the people here to pay for them with no income.  The where is becoming progressively less here and progressively more elsewhere  and the more that happens the lower our standard of living becomes and the less able we are to take advantage of those cheap goods.gt What happens when our trading partners turn on US companies and hurts their ability to sell abroad? if I may borrow a phrase Then What?US companies are already progressively becoming less able to sell abroad  and they are simultaneously becoming less able to sell domestically as fewer people have disposable income to buy their products.The then what? is that people will buy from the US the things they cannot get elsewhere while domestic companies will make the things currently being made abroad  and employing US citizens in the process  making everyone here except the crony capitalists who push the unrestricted free trade agenda wealthier.gt Finally let me conclude by reiterating that tariffs are taxes.They are indeed  but they are not taxes on anyone in the US  they are taxes on companies that use cheap foreign labor to put US workers out of work.gt And usually they come about because some special interest has lobbied for them.I submit that unrestricted free trade is also a tax  and it is a tax on everyone that remains employed in the US and has to support the half of the country so far that cannot find a decent job.  Further it is a tax that comes about because the crony capitalists are able to move their production overseas and sell into the US market without paying for the cost of their practices to the US taxpayer.,conservatives,d837njc,1,t5_2qj2e

Is the above an indirect measure?Only in the sense that it works if you see only one side as biased and the other as insightful.Look at the examples she gives to support that methodgt Liberals I found would frequently ask how much contact Id had with social activists reentry workers or residents in highcrime neighborhoods. They regarded those as insightyielding contacts. On the other hand if I mentioned things I had heard from cops or prosecutors they were dismissive. Cops are prone to wagoncircling prosecutors are drunk on power. Theyre biased.It is hard to argue that social activists are unbiased  they are biased by definition.  People who see them as unbiased are likely not going to be objective enough to recognize that view defines their own bias.  I had to look up the phrase reentry workers  I suspected I knew what it meant but wasnt familiar with the term and dont know enough about them to determine their bias though as a subset of social workers it is likely farleft.  Residents of highcrime neighborhoods are all over the map depending on who you talk to.  Cops are prone to wagoncircling and have a tendency to see anyone not them as a perp.  Ive not seen prosecutors as drunk on power but they do have a strong incentive to gain convictions  and it is often strong enough for them to use unethical or illegal means to do so.IMO it is better to recognize the bias of everyone involved and also that there is insight to be had there too if you ask the right questions in the right ways.,conservatives,dbfri8q,2,t5_2qj2e

10865575,0,t1_de0fqxl,I am conservative in most senses of the word except on samesex marriage. Let the LGBT folks get married. It makes no difference to me.  A common argument against samesex marriage outside of religious reasons is that the center of society and government is the nuclear family. The breakdown of the nuclear family leads to society breakdown which leads to government breakdown. So samesex marriage moves away from a mom and dad nuclear family. Its an argument.  I worked in churches and was heavily involved in the evangelical christian world for a while. For most of them its the idea that it is immoral to be gay and against Gods wishes so to accept samesex marriage is to say it is okay to sin. AND for some reason many church folks really get stuck on that one idea and take it to another level. Its hard to understand why exactly personally.  As to Nationalized healthcare most conservatives want less government intervention so keeping the government out of healthcare is an extension of that. And the idea of personal liberty and freedom we dont want to pay for someone else who chooses not to work and be a part of society. So we dont want someone to have something for free.   Medicare is a single payer nationalized healthcare plan for seniors and disabled. Those that work pay into it. So most see it as a return on investment more than government freebies. Medicate does have issues that results in extra waiting and some doctors dont take it. Most do though.   The VA program is a mess as it is a single provider network instead of a single payer. I could see the US developing a single payer healthcare system but it would have to be done in a democrat controlled government. It is smart to do it but its not ideologically the way conservatives roll.  As to gun control most of the gun violence you read about is the result of illegally bought guns. Most gang violence see Chicago is done with stolen or strawman purchases. The vast majority of gun owners use them for personal protection or hunting very very responsibly.  Some of us live far from the nearest police station. I live about  minutes from a decent size police station. Response time to a real emergency would be fairly short.  I have friends who live at least an hour from the nearest police station. Sometimes when I travel I am an hour or so from the nearest police station. So personal protection becomes important for residences and those that travel. AND business owners in more high risk environments tend to carry for the same reason. If there is a true emergency the police is far away.  So when the government wants to take away guns we say hell no. First because we dont want that kind of government intrusion in our lives. Secondly we dont trust the authority as much see revolutionary war. Thirdly we value our right to protect ourselves against aggressors. So thats why we hold on to our guns.  There is arguments about what type of guns people should own. Most murders and gun violence are done with handguns so the argument sucks.  Lastly the big issue is with school shootings and public shootings. We do have a few too many of these things in our country of  million people. It is literally a few people out of so many that cause the issue. So regulating guns wont solve mass shootings or gang violence.  In fact Chicago has the strictest gun laws and an extreme amount of gun violence.,conservatives,de0pgkt,4,t5_2qj2e

In other words public welfare and business are at odds in regards to prison operation which creates a conflict of interest for the associated parties.

We across the globe all of our enemies took this as a sign of weakness and asserted power into regions like the Middle East.For Russia the pulling of missile defense was a green light for Russia to deal with Crimea without consequences from the USA. Also they expanded their influence in IranSyria.I think some of this is due to Nixon going to China. Pick a bad enemy any bad enemy and open diplomacy with them and watch as the world crows about your foreign policy legacy. Well look at us and China now...gone are any checks with MFN on human rights abuses and China has been dumping money into American politics via vehicles like The Clinton Foundation.

Why did they cook up this Russian flap? The easy and obvious answer was to change the news cycle on all of the revelations in the hacks from Democratic party corruption to security.
