2441407,0,t3_2ngsk4,gt In Ruiz Zambrano the Court followed down this road only to retreat a few months later. To me it is the most noteworthy lesson from the Dano judgment that this road was not followed. Judges in Luxembourg treat the free movement of Union citizens in essence as a matter of legal construction  not as a projection sphere for political imaginations about social justice.What do you think about that? Will Avramopoulos be able to push for a more comprehensive policy?This is Citizen Houses summary of the Right to Free Movement.Also the Migration Policy Institute published a report on the dynamics and drivers of mobility within the EU.gt Although much academic research and public rhetoric has focused on the largescale movements from east to west the report finds that these movements represent only a small share of a longerterm phenomenon that continues to evolve. The report distinguishes three main eras of free movement in the EU preenlargement post enlargement and the migration arising in the aftermath of the economic crisis. While noting that most EU citizens continue to mention work as a primary motivator for moving the report finds that a significant share of EU citizens move for other reasons that include family education and even retirement.Finally an analysis  of the Commissions handbook on marriages of convenience between EU citizens and nonEU nationals.,europeans,cmdgo7e,2,t5_2wb9d

4451690,0,t3_3bzm5v,The case for Greece when it forgave Germanys debtgt Forgiving debt if done right can get an economy back on its feet.gt The International Monetary Fund certainly thinks so according to a new report in which it argues Greece should get help.gt But Germany another major creditor to Greece is resisting even though it knows better than most what debt relief can achieve. After the hell of World War II the Federal Republic of Germany  commonly known as West Germany  got massive help with its debt from former foes.gt Among its creditors then? Greece.gt The  agreement in which Greece and about  other countries effectively wrote off a large chunk of Germanys loans and restructured the rest is a landmark case that shows how effective debt relief can be. It helped spark what became known as the German economic miracle.gt So its perhaps ironic that Germany is now among the countries resisting Greeces requests for debt ,europeans,csrtjhy,3,t5_2wb9d
