808203,0,t3_23e1s3,Its great compared to BB.  But its a solid season.  Twists are hurting the season in my opinion. Andrew leaving crippled and alliances entire game.  Power shifts only occurred because of Canada.  The first  was in power then Neda Jon Adel and Heather some have had it since.  Going to need that group of  to turn on each other.  Neda I think is very good player and Jon Adel Heather and Sarah are solid players.  Kenny and Sarah showed a lot of potential but the twist sort of just collapsed their game.  Allison hasnt really done much and what she has done is questionable.  Arlie I think was horrible.  He did nothing and talk big in DR and then present himself as an obvious target constantly and it finally caught up to him and he was blindsided.  I think characters are about on part w BBCan  but BBCan  was just dominated by Emmett and Jillian making it really predictable.Id probably rank the seasonsSgtSgtSgtBBcangtBBcangtBBgtBBBB and  were just awful.  S and  had some very good character but production fucked up S gameplay and S Hayden just sort of dominated.

855740,0,t1_ch1jlk6,If Sabrina gets to the end she was dragged there. Shes only kept around in that house at this point because shes an easy goat.  For Jon and Neda drag her to  and then cut her.  She sucks at this game and isnt a threat to win comps.  And if you are a player that is terrible at comps then you have to have an influential socialgame that leads to the eviction of jurors Sabrina doesnt have that.  The one week where she actually had influence on the vote she kept someone that wanted her gone over someone that needed to work w them.  And Heather and Allison got along really well and she has a good shot at that vote.Heather can say how she was a target early in the game and she was able to go from being ostracized from the house to end up forming an alliance and getting to the end and actually won competitions.  And if she gets to the end that means she made a big move getting rid of Neda andor Jon.  Sabrina gets to the end she was dragged there and Heather should get Jon Neda Adel and Canada easily.  I dont see those  saying well we kept Sabrina because she sucked so we should vote for her.  Neda is fine w backstabbing and it seems Jon is also.  And Id bet Arlie votes for her and depends on how screwed over Allison feels from Heather she might vote for her but weve seen super fans being the most bitter and horrible players and Arlie and Allison both have been that.Whats Sabrinas argument?  I formed an alliance day  that has  members on the jury.  I had influence on the game prior to jury portion when most begin playing hardcore.  I was kept around because I suck at comps.  Most of the people left in the house didnt even care what I had to say and I was dragged to the end.And Sabrina has no shot at Canadas vote. Shes edited as an emotional wreck.  She doesnt even have many DRs about game its just their bigger threats out there.  Heather also is constantly switching spots wNeda as Jokers favorite and usually does a pretty solid job reflecting of the fan favorite.,BigBrother,ch1jwt1,2,t5_2r4zz

HoHs including the last one and he came in second in an absolutely grueling part one of the final HoH and a PoV is nothing to scoff at. Only a handful of winners have more than  comp wins Drew Dan Hayden Rachel Ian and Andy. As a sidenote its kind of fascinating at how basically all the winners since Dan have won a lot of comps and only a couple before him did. Im not sure if Dans strategy to lay low the first half of the season then explode with comp wins wore off on people or if players just generally valueplay less strategic games but its an interesting split. Theres also the fact that the number of players has increased over the years and there were less comps in the early years no PoV in season  no real incentive to win PoV in season .,BigBrother,ch2bksq,2,t5_2r4zz

1124514,0,t1_chvvutp,A He wasnt immune. He could have been gone week  if they voted out Danielle. You can claim that theyd flip things up and bring the coaches in early and its possible there was something in the returning players contracts that said they had to last a while but I kind of doubt it considering two of them didnt even make jury.B Will had all returning players his season and good logical players at that. Jordan had more vets in her season and all but Dick made jury. Dan had only  other vets his season so no matter what he would have had to flip a newbie and two didnt even make jury. Theres a big difference there.C I watched the backyard interviews where at least one and possibly both I cant remember offhand of Joe and Jenn said they voted for Ian because they wanted a newbie to win. It had a big impact.

1124672,0,t1_chw4106,I agree that Natalie got screwed over in relation to the Coup and the Chima jury vote. Those were shitty events she could not have predicted and she does deserve some credit. But that said I still think she was a goat because the only person I can see her potentially beating is Lydia. Being a goat is not a reflection of a players gameplay I thought Nat had pretty good gameplay but instead is a reflection of how they are perceived by the jury.  With regards to JessieLydia. Were they bitter? Absolutely. But a huge portion of this game is getting people to like you and ensuring that they want you to win. If you are unable to put people in that mindset then you dont deserve to win and when people disagree with this statement I see it as being similar to saying that the flashier team in a game of basketball deserves to win over the team that ended with a higher point total. Establishing what the criteria necessary to win will be different based on the social dynamic in the house each year it is up to the players to get a read on the pulse of the house. I dont know if you watch Survivor but this is a concept that differentiates a strong player like Russell from a good player like Tony. Votes are occasionally determined by strategy but almost always come down to the social game. Natalie had a good strategic mind but her personality turned people off because she was often condescending and confrontational. Her lie about her age also didnt help her case. People care about the little stuff. The best example of this being important that I can think of off hand would be in Rennys jury speech in Season .Jordan was not a goat. She was perceived as weak at challenges but she would have won by a  vote even if Chima remained in the game. And while I agree she did not actively manipulate people I disagree with the statement hat she was not aware of house dynamics and her place in them. She was incredibly inarticulate and pretty stupid in an academic sense but her emotional intelligence was actually quite strong.Adam Poch was an ACTUAL goat because he was not going to ever get votes to win at the finale and that was why keeping him around until later on in the game was not a mistake on anyones behalf. This is a very key difference between him and jordan. ,BigBrother,chw4um6,2,t5_2r4zz

Several of the guys have talked about her inappropriate touching and movements when they cuddle and that she has even gone so far as to caress Haydons? junk with her elbow.  Is it possible that one of these guys went to the DR to discuss how uncomfortable she is making them and asked either for advice on how to deal with it or for them to have a talk with her?  I can easily imagine how the latter would go down.  She would get upset and defensive and might even accuse production Matt it sounds like if speaking to her in an offensive and inappropriate way.  Now shes upset about how the others in the house see her and what the rest of the viewers are thinking about her.

1485799,0,t1_cj2fw9q,I think he doesnt realize that there is an important difference between Survivor and Big Brother that would make his experience moot. Survivor is entirely finished filming before the season starts while Big Brother is occurs during the actual season. Big Brother gets real time feedback on who entices viewers and who doesnt while Survivor has none of that. Survivor also gets to edit with knowledge of who makes it deep in the game so its easier for them to craft stories around the ones who stick around. Big Brother on the other hand doesnt know ahead of time who is making it deep and sometimes ends up in situations where they make a player huge and end up with a lot of motivation to keep him around. ,BigBrother,cj2iq8v,3,t5_2r4zz

I saw Zach speech as having little to do with thinking Amber led on Caleb and should have close the deal so to speak and more to do with just trying to get her out of the house. Biased article is biased.,BigBrother,cje442q,0,t5_2r4zz
1578879,0,t1_cje5xq7,Mine are somewhat similar though I fully disagree with you on some of your choices. First Im shocked you have Derrick so low. He hasnt really done anything bad in the game and has played a great game. The only thing even remotely questionable that hes done is maybe thrown Donnys name out there a little bit but that doesnt deserve such a huge drop from the top to near the bottom. Victoria to me hasnt really had much of a chance to play the game because she was cast as an outside for no real reason. She does talk game to people and she isnt really mean or annoying. How you have Jocasta above her is beyond me. Jocasta is insignificant. The only competition she won was because someone else won it for her. She doesnt talk game. Shes unintelligent about religion and thats her profession. Nicole is way too high on your list for my liking. She talks about people behind their back all the time specifically Victoria. She gets jealous of Hayden giving her attention but then she goes and cuddles big time with Cody. If you want to say Victoria is annoying you have to say Nicole is just as bad or worse. Haaaaaaaaaaayden and staaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahp are two things she says all the time in the house and it gets old. Shes trying to be cute and its clear that shes trying too hard.. Caleb. Jocasta.

I probably do the most as far as looking at this subreddit and the information I get from you guys. I just watch the show the three nights its aired and go on with my life. We all understand that CBS edits the show how they feel and we know we dont get the full picture but none of us want to waste the summer on watching live feeds.I work  hours a day waste almost  hours on the commute to work sleep roughly  hours at night and take about  hour to prep in the morning not just me lol that just leaves me with about  hours to make supper and wind down for the day. I dont have time to devote to the feeds.Hell Im in Canada and never even bothered to check BBCAN feeds for either season either and they are given for free!Im sure we would all have a different outlook on the game if we all watched the feeds too but not everyone is a diehard fan that needs to live and breathe Big Brother while its airing.edit words and such,BigBrother,cjn1si1,9,t5_2r4zz

I also dont think it necessarily endeared him to anyone in the houses eyes. Yeah he may have saved Cody and Caleb from going home this week but he really shows that hell turn on you. If he can turn on Zankie he can turn on anything. I think it really shows that he cant be trusted by anyone. He turned on Zach not once but twice. Even if Zach wasnt a member of the alliance Frankie was most with I think he still could have avoided putting up Zach until final  at least by just playing the hes my friend and I cant be the one who does that to him card. He definitely should have put Derrick up or at least Vic or Christine. He should have been protecting his friend at this point. ,BigBrother,cjwyaj4,1,t5_2r4zz

1747921,0,t3_2eh4zb,Id really enjoy a merged game. But Id also like to see it run by the Canadian production team and that is never going to happen. Having it be an AllStars battle would be great. The problem with that is that youll end up with three BB seasons between two countries. BBCA goes late Winter in to Spring. BB US goes during the Summer. That leaves the Fall for a merged season unless one or the other suspends their season for a year. And I dont see that happening. And CBS is not going to air BB in the Fall. Not unless there was another writers strike and they needed content asap. Nice idea but the odds of it happening are extremely low. ,BigBrother,cjzhh5u,11,t5_2r4zz
1748258,0,t1_cjzf52l,Im not going to put this season on my alltime best list but its definitely in my top half at this point.

Its had a great mixture of psychoDevinCalebZach and seemingly invincible Derrick gameplay.

1748382,0,t1_cjzivez,Uh wut? What would your winnings have anything to do with your citizenship? Theyre completely unrelated.Technically you are renouncing all other citizenships as a US citizen but the State Department no longer cares and other countries generally require formal renouncing ie. signing a form and dont recognize the US oath.The prize money is just like any other income. If youre a dual citizen youll just have a really complicated tax situation. You dont instantly lose any other citizenships if you start working in the US as a dual citizen so why would you if you won something?Edit Theres a lot of people that are choosing to renounce their citizenship when they earn any sort of money internationally whether its income or a prize or something else but thats just because of tax purposes. IRS will tax you on all international income as long as youre a citizen regardless of residency. I believe the CRA will only tax you on international income if you still are considered a Canadian resident which is a complicated process all on its own.,BigBrother,cjzjk6f,2,t5_2r4zz

That show is more about intrapersonal relationships than it is about gamesmanship.  BB is also a lot more integral in those shows as well.

I think thats a skill Will and Dan had in spades and its a huge factor in how adaptable you are. And Ive seen Derrick overreact to things time and time again with the most recent thing being the rewind button. Once it was pressed he should have just dropped it but it clearly put him on tilt for a little while.That said hes usually able to reel it in before it does any damage to his game and for all I know its just another thing he fabricates to keep a certain persona. But because hes had pretty great luck this season we havent been able to see how he handles true adversity and its definitely something I want to see really tested before I definitively put him up beside Will and Dan.,BigBrother,ck9zw6t,1,t5_2r4zz

I noticed however that in case people ARE making sounds they frequently mute it out. So Joeys eviction this season when she was listening to good bye messages and Calebs came on she started cursing him out and calling his stupid which was making all of us laugh. When I went home and watched the episode you could see that she was saying something but couldnt hear anything because they muted it out placing priority on the good bye messaged.Not sure if that gave you the insight that you wanted but that is my person experience. ,BigBrother,ckbvqg8,14,t5_2r4zz

Its one thing to say it to an evicted jury member but he totally threw that around in the DR. BB is never against throwing in some one playing up the evil mastermind card so trying to say maybe they didnt show these types of DR sessions before is totally off base. Chances are BB is feeding him the youre puppet master so act it thing just as they feed Victoria the princess lines.So yes Derrick has been pandering mostly for AFP which is fine but Im just telling you the reason why some are not his fan.

He knows its a game and everyone is in it to win it but now that hes out I feel like hes just trying to be ultra likeable and get ready for his new life as a famous beloved BB playerI think he still doesnt have a clue hes hated.

You seem to think no only because you threw out half the competitions a bunch he won and then said he only had  wins which should be .    competitions in a single season even with all the other comps thrown out still makes him one of the better competition players in BB history.

1925135,0,t3_2go9l4,A big part of winning Big Brother is playing a tremendous social game and making yourself as nonthreatening as possible in everyones eyes. Both of which Derrick did. He got pretty much most people in the house to trust him with their game. People constantly went up to him to tell him what is going on in the house or to hash out their plans with him to get his approval. On top of all that he took time out of his day everyday to form a relationship with the one HG everyone counted out since week  Victoria. Knowing full well that he could use her and knowing full well that should was a potential jury vote. He had a well thought out plan. Dont say he had an advantage entering the house thats complete bullshit. Hes just more intelligent and patient than everyone else this season.,BigBrother,ckl5y2u,1,t5_2r4zz

Having bought many burritos shirts and other miscellany from streetparking lot vendors over the years I am comfortable taking part in a free and open market.

2241786,0,t1_cloqj3a,gt Daniele over Dick I feel like Daniele played a far better social and competitive game than her father. Strategically they were on the same level. How did Daniele play a better social game?  Her social game was horrible.  Dick is the one that got people to flip their votes when they needed them.  Dani sucked at it in S and was even worse in S.  And even though Dick was a complete and total ass hole to people they hated Dani more.  Dani isolated herself from getting to know people to be w Nick and people just hated her.  As awful as Dick was they still hated him lessminus Jen and Jessica even said he vote was who she liked more.  gtRyan over Adam This is the vote I was always the most confused about. I felt like Ryan played a much better social strategic and competitive game. I have no idea why the jury voted the way they did. Ryan rubbed people the wrong way during endgame just how he lied to Sharon on the way out and he just didnt form as good of relationships as Adam.  Also they hated his GF.  But Adam doesnt really get credit for his ability to get people to like him. Sparing James was dumb but it was a good will thing that got him his votealso he showed he wont just do what others want he did what he wanted.  Adam put up w a lot to get people on his side.  Sheila hated him and he got her on his side.  At least thats my understanding of it.,BigBrother,clos92n,1,t5_2r4zz

Thats how the game was designed. It also shouldnt be surprising that some of the attractive guys target each other as well. Its just how the game works.Now some of your examples are decent. Angie from BB Heather from BBCan and Cassie were all examples where they were excluded by the women of the house largely because of jealousy.But some are misleading. For example while Candice was treated like shit in BB but it was pretty clear that race was a major factor in that and not the fact that she happened to be pretty. Kara was targeted in BB because of her link to Dan not because of her looks.A lot of your examples are weak because they took place during seasons where men ended up being more picked on and excluded than any of the women. Do you remember how Zach was treated in BB? People refused to be in the same room as him. He was treated worse by the house than Jen and Dani ever treated each other  it was DICK who truly treated Jen like shit not Daniele DaniJen actually had periods where they got along well and are now friends. Brendon and Andrew were excluded by the Brigade throughout the entirety of BB and were treated worse than the girls treated each other arguably two of the prettiest girls MonetBrit were in a super tight alliance through Monets entire stay. Some of your examples just came straight out of this air. Brittany and Amber didnt feud in BB... they were targeted by a combination of guys and the least attractive girl in the house Christine. Laura got along great with Jordan and was targeted because she stood up to Jessie a guy.  So even though some times there are instances where the pretty girls target each other you are grasping at straws. There have been plenty of times where attractive girls were capable of working together  BritneyMonet PorscheDani JanelleSarah BB TallaJillian JordanLaura are all examples off the top of my head where attractive girls got along perfectly fine. If you end up receiving downvotes for your post it will have nothing to do with people believing that females are perfect. It will have to do with you generalizing all of them together with no real justification for doing so.,BigBrother,cpqy07h,6,t5_2r4zz

People didnt like his perceived selfimportance especially after his sister was revealed. Also viewers were quite fed up with his always on personality. He often came across as more of a performer than a genuine person. He was very aware of the cameras and seemed to crave attention.People were also quite angry about the way he played Zach. While that was obviously gameplay the show didnt accurately portray that Frankie did start a lot of the scheming against Zach and was probably the main reason that Zach was evicted. He pushed for Zachs eviction as early as week two when Devin was HoH.

If he had been considered for nomination like Bruno it would mean the other players heads werent in their own asses. The reason the game seemed over after a couple weeks wasnt because he was playing such a uniquely good game it was because he was the only who seemed to be playing the game at all. Everyone else had some weird agenda like being a youtube star movie star or rock star or they halfassed the game because they hadnt paid attention to past seasons.

I laughed when she said she felt she could trust Godfrey and Bruno more than Willow. Like da fuck? Brunos been going around telling everyone that theres a girls alliance! Jesus Christ Brit. Its a shame Bruno did win the Veto because I think she may and thats a big may actually have chosen him as a replacement if he hadnt won. I cannot even lie. This hurts so much.

Her first nominees were perfect for her game but why didnt she just replace Zach with Ashleigh? I know she was mad at him but he would have calmed her down and gotten her vote back. Taking her out would have been a huge blow to him.Big Brother cant have another triple eviction. The execution was disastrous.

Zach and Bruno are both in great danger of going home this week so not them. Brittnee is still viewed as a weak player and would lose out in a vote to everyone except Pilli and Ashleigh imo.So that leaves Sarah and Godfrey.

3923997,0,t3_35d429,Be prepared for a slower season with A LOT more content.... Daily episodes can become hard to keep up with especially from a different country and if you let a couple days go by without watching youll have a lot of catching up to do. Aside from that its a completely different game. The nomination process involves having every housemate nominate two others and putting those with the most nominations up for the public vote. Its definitely less strategic as housemates are forbidden from talking about nominations apart from times with specific twists but theres definitely glimpses of it amidst all the drama and nonsense.... Big Brother is also way more interactive with the housemates often having them do secret tasks or just messing with them. Lastly the theme of this season is about Time Shifts or something of the sort. Not too sure what that means but personally having watched a lot of the previous seasons I hope the housemates end up traveling through time to other seasons of the show almost like Lost haha.,BigBrother,cr3kl6n,5,t5_2r4zz

I defend Zach because I dont think he deserves the personal attacks people like you and others here make against him.  Your criticisms of his character are exaggerated to say the least.  Can you explain why everyone in the house loves Zach while everyone on this subreddit appears to hate him in reality it is five or six people that post all the time not nearly everyone as you suggest?You are welcome to your opinion and I am welcome to disagree and question it.  Im not enraged about anything.  Just trying to understand the hate.  I admit that it is frustrating to be down voted into oblivion for even daring to suggest that Zach is not the scum of the earth.  Im a human being with opinions too and it sucks when a handful of ardent Sarah supporters it only takes  down votes to get rid of a post get to decide who gets to be heard and who doesnt on this board.  Im sure you would feel the same way if you were in my shoes.  No one likes to feel like their opinion isnt worthy off even being heard.,BigBrother,cr51uza,1,t5_2r4zz

I do wonder if getting rid of Pillar instead of Godfrey will come back to bite them so far it hasnt.Lastly we can argue semantics but without the coup it is of my opinion Sarah would be out by now.  You cant say she would have won the next HOH because Bruno might have and she couldnt have won back to back HOHs anyway and Ashleigh won the veto on the nd. Im assuming youre familiar with BB.  BB and Rachel is one of my favorites ever.  The twist that brought Brendon back in the house.

The only difference between him and Adam Pochs game is Poch tried winning comps while Godfrey didnt.

Her DRs also annoy a lot of people. Plus the fact that she is a plus sized model who has younger fans who see her as a role model irks some people in this subreddit for some reason. Some people disliked Brittnee so much they started rooting for Ashlee even though she was virtually irrelevant for the first half of the season. I personally think that Ashley and Brittnee had a very similar game lots of comp wins and each had a strong ally thorughout but that point gets lost on Brittnee detractors.

4329555,0,t3_3akm7i,I fully concede that I am probably a huge idiot in regard to a certain statement from DaVonne but I am  ready to see her polarize people as early as the first night and crash and burn hard. I dont understand how it would take an expert poker player to become a very talentedgood poker dealer. I can see how temperance demeanor and experience could contribute to those things but I just think shes overselling her skills in poker and bluffing in this house.I really want to see how Audrey lands in the house see how her status as a transgendered woman affects her initial game with people. Unfortunately that wont be evident from the premiere alone.I really want to see Vanessa kill it this season. I have a few reservations but man Im actually really excited to see her play and interact with people!Overall I think this is going to be a very fun season with a lot of great personalities. There are some people I feel are cringeworthy but other than that I think well have a great time watching the live feeds. More game than BB and hopefully as much if not more personality.,BigBrother,csdo4vw,2,t5_2r4zz

4366082,0,t3_3b0vxy,when I first heard BD take over and saw that some of the cast members had twins mediately figured that it would be new twists from each season every week.

However when Julie said that whenever they hear the noise a new twist is affect my first thought was that this is productions way of stepping in to twist the game in the way they want it.

4520887,0,t1_ct03qxy,gt I think you are really reaching trying to make most of these comparisons. I was reaching to make most of them because I wanted to ensure each male had a partner from the other season to show the strength of their respective season. I also agree that Caleb and James but I was doing them one by one and at the time I thought they were fine.Also I compared Donny with James as to me they are both seen as laid back country men who arent constantly scheming to make something happen every time I see James he is laying back with his hat over his eyes listening in on conversations with Meg and the others. I also compared Caleb and Austin because they are both set out to be strong physical threats. Calebs social game involved him showing his physical threat and forcing people to join him in the main alliance of the season bomb squad or be against him and probably go home. Austins social game isnt as out there but he is in the main group and definitely will become more and more like Caleb as the season progresses. But yea As you see Caleb and Austin was pretty much my last comparison and I compared them because they were the ones I hadnt compared with anyone yet. Other than that  comparison Caleb and Austin I think the rest were pretty close.gt A point that I really think you nailed was comparing Devin to Jeff.Thank you. The way I see them as the classic hotheaded muscular males who are up themselves so that is why I compared them with each other.TLDR  Yes I did base most of my comparison to their preshow marketing archetype with a little of their gameplay added although it was ONLY to show that the males of BB were stronger than those of BB and the females of BB are stronger than those of BB.,BigBrother,ct0hzkg,1,t5_2r4zz

The way Natalie and Lydia just fawned over Jessie and followed him around like dumb little puppies was unbearable Chima just sucked see her breakdown and they all just came off as really mean maybe not Jessie but definitely the three girls. If they had voted the other side of the house out and dominated the rest of that season wouldve been completely unwatchable for me.

This is a show first and foremost. Its not inherently a game. If they want to accommodate someone they get to accommodate someone. Theres no real way to punish her since shes getting unanimously evicted on Thursday. If they wanted to take away her stipend they would have let her selfevict or they would have expelled her but they would have had to find a way to edit that without making them look bad since they let an obviously unfit person on the show or feel like they were making the transgender community look bad. They chose the path of least resistance and since Audreys rulebreaking isnt affecting the competition for anyone else it doesnt bother me.

4653880,0,t3_3eoaa3,Personally I think that Big Brother is often times making small changes to push things in the best story line favor. For instance if it would great for house guest A to win an HOH one week and they have an estimated  chance at winning it production will make the HOH comp be something that house guest has a better shot at winning maybe a  chance now. So nothing major and a lot of the time the odds just happen to fall in a way that negates productions manipulations but other times it works out for them. I do not believe that they have some grand idea for the season that they are pushing and I dont believe that its rigged. If that were not the case then I dont see why they would have let the last two seasons be so boring. Theyre just a constant nudging force  that can change odds in some players favor but never guarantees anything. ,BigBrother,cth6jc1,3,t5_2r4zz

4658086,0,t3_3enj2j,Will be interesting to see how the twins games play out. Julia shockingly did not tell her sister about the plan to backdoor Austin before she came back in the house. What a betrayal! She claimed it was to let Liz play the competition with a clear mind but that is bs. Funny though how it actually played out exactly that way with Liz winning it solo and going against Vanessas hopes. At some level Julia must be worried about Lizs alliance with Austin.It will also be interesting to see if the S alliance later becomes unstable with  ShelliClay vs AustinLizJulia and Vanessa in the middle. It was more solid when it was  with V in the middle and Julia as a phantom partner.Vanessa is just in way too deep. She knows that being named HOH was a disaster for her game. Not only is she getting more blood on her hands she also is winning too many competitions. People are realizing she is scary smart. She probably ought to backdoor Jackie  and claim she is avenging the people that Jackie put up but that was James and Liz and James knew he was a pawn. OMG Liz was trying her hardest and doesnt know that Vanessa was in on the plan for James to throw the competition. If Vanessa nominates Jackie she will renege on their deal.  Seems like Vanessa is going to have to go after Becky or someone else. If Vanessa can escape from all this and win she will become one of the best in BB history.,BigBrother,cthpjq4,0,t5_2r4zz

Features someone who is regarded as one of the best players in BB History but some people disregard it due to his extremely weak competition which I feel is irrelevant they werent the sharpest tools in the shed but this player earned there spot as the winner. Id say its my th favourite season of the lot. But my top  are much better than this and I suggest watching them first especially since they are all older meaning nothing will be spoiled.

4952182,0,t1_cuir030,I disagree. There are  people in the house  thats still halfway to final . The best time to get them out is next week when the Austwins clearly pose a threat with numbers. Vanessa wont get blood on her hands. Its DE so itll happen so fast that Vanessa can convince the remaining Austwins the house is out to get them and to stick with her.Vanessa will then have two Austwins on one side and JMac  Steve on the other.edit If Austwins win HOH during DE that means the house will be split  for the following week. It would be three people versus two Austwins in the HOH comp. This will be their last chance to split up Austwins. Thats two solid chances after this week to get rid of the trio.,BigBrother,cuirgo0,4,t5_2r4zz
4952590,0,t1_cuirvor,Great response so thank you for it. If Vanessa were to nominate two of the Austwins right off the bat and the third as a replacement that guarantees that one of them go home and their powerhouse threesome is demoted to at BEST a couple in AustinLiz or JuliaLiz and at worst two singles if AustinJulia are the ones to stay.If Liz left this week Austin and Julia would no longer work together. Both of them may want to work with Vanessa though since theyll be alone and as Vanessa always tells everyone shes alone too. If either of them won HOH Im very confident that Vanessa could convince either of them to put up SteveJmac or MegJames because theyre both pairs and she could convince Julia or Austin whichever wins HOH that theyd be at the bottom of any group they tried working with. If Austin left this week LizJulia would work with Vanessa still. Yes theyd be pissed initially but Vanessa would mist them into realizing that theyre not going to join with MegJames or SteveJmac so their best bet is to make a new threesome of just the girls. If Julia left this week LizAustin would basically be in the same position as LizJulia would be theyd want to work with Vanessa to have a group of three against the other two pairs. If JamesMeg or SteveJmac win next week both pairs would probably target the other pair but both would be completely susceptible to Vanessas misting so she could probably influence their noms one way or the other. On her current track if JamesMeg were to leave that leaves Austwins  people and JamesMeg Vanessa Steve Jmac  people left in the house. She stays at the bottom of the Austwins totem pole banking on JamesJmacMeg winning next weeks HOH lol Meg because she SHOULD be thinking if Austwins win they may backdoor her like theyve tried to do which she is aware of. Austwins have won four HOHs between them and JamesJmacMeg have won two between them so assuming theyll win next weeks is an extremely risky move. ,BigBrother,cuitbfb,2,t5_2r4zz

4963306,0,t1_cuk3y0e,Its easier for most people to look at current setup and go James Austin Liz? Steve Meg Vanessa Julia ? are in the game so theres  HGs left! yeah I know the board wont be updated about the buy back until Sunday as opposed to the memory board which requires you to look and decipher based on color who is still here and who isnt.      I think once the Sunday episode drops and they update everything youll better appreciate this new one I assume icons and the such will be added      But what it basically boils down to is more peoples brains are wired to find the current graphic more informational than the former graphic. Your mind may not work like ours and Im not saying anything about your intelligence or ours its like how some people can read these words Ive typed and other people whos brains interpret things differently cant understand a single word Ive typed.

But an openly bitter jury member is about as static a variable as weve seen in this game.

5049953,0,t3_3k492e,I think different people watch the show for different reasons. Some people like the game and watching very strategic maneuvers.

All of these are valid.Season  and  are very different in regard to how the game unfolded so those who like different things will not share the same opinion on which season was better.For me I like the game first and foremost and last season was one of the worst for a fan of such. A power alliance ran it from very early on and every week you knew what was going to happen from the minute a new HOH was crowned. The ultimate insult to the game in my opinion was using skittles to pick a nominee. I hated that moment and I hated the season. The only redeeming part was Derricks masterful play but even that was boring.,BigBrother,cuuplbk,1,t5_2r4zz

People gravitate towards power Vanessa is power because she is a comp beast and would form a powerful alliance early in the game. Derricks game would be to a gravitate towards the power work with Vanessa for a time being that he could break off with part of her alliance or b manipulate and manage the opposing alliance usually the underdogs who struggle to win things like the ADCs of the season. a only works if hes better at manipulating people in his alliance than Vanessa if her loyalties are better he fails to get her out and b only works if his alliance has the numbers to get her out when they do win a comp.

In Survivor really the only woman who has won doing that is Parvati and she was sitting next to Wahnah Montana. Women just arent supposed to be cutthroat. If I were in the house I would  take her to the end over everyone else who is left. I dont think she has a chance at AustinJulias votes anymore or Lizs if shes in jury.

5120378,0,t1_cv350o7,I think he knew that he wasnt going to be liked due to some of his decisions in the house.  When he told Liz I ruined my life for you. I think he meant it in regards to being hated by the public outside the house for their relationship.  Even the wellliked HGs need to prepare for a difficult time outside the house.  When people adore you as a celebrity they come to expect things of you even though they dont deserve anything from you.  Its very easy for fans to turn on someone if they feel like theyre being slighted or ignored by their idol and its very difficult to give so many fans the time and attention they feel they deserve.  No one can love or hate with more passion than a madman and a madmans love can quickly turn to the deepest hatred.  I think all of the HGs whether adored or hated would be best advised to avoid reading comments about themselves on social media.  If theyre really smart theyd hire a PR firm to run their own media accounts for the next few months too just so they can avoid interacting with the the rabid and unruly fans or making any missteps.  ,BigBrother,cv374v1,6,t5_2r4zz

5134821,0,t3_3lbjcy,There are two things I need to say VANESSA SUCKS I HATE HERI kid I kid.We have to be honest here Vanessa is easily in the top  of Big Brother winners ever. Her supposed lack of emotional control coupled with her masterful gameplay and the fact that she actually won competitions proves that shes one of the best alltime. Anyone that says otherwise is probably just bitter.With that in mind one player who I wish had gone further was Shelli. She had the social game she was a comp beast and she was really smart. Clay crippled her game and by the time he was gone she was a mess. Before James and Johnny Mac for an AllStar season I would like Van and Shelli to participate.,BigBrother,cv4xr9w,28,t5_2r4zz

Shes otherwise had no one targeting her since Beckys HOH. Steve and John have talked about it and...nothing. Johns never won and HOH so theres that but Steves won several and never tried to go after her. I think the only time she seriously needed the POV was in F and thats to be expected at F most of the time. Youre right that Derrick didnt need to win F veto but Cody was delusional about his skill in the game and I dont think Victoria had a clue what was going on. ,BigBrother,cv60den,2,t5_2r4zz

Her success in the game was dependent on her side almost ALWAYS being in control of the house and personally winning a lot of comps herslef. The other side was inept in HOH comps and got steamrolled because of it.And Ive said this several times on here...I dont think her crying victim complex was strategy I think thats just the way she is. She got a favorable edit in the first  of the game but the last part shes been just as much of an emotional lunatic in the DRs they aired as she was in the house. Her actual strategy was lets make a deal. She was good at aggressively interrogating people to get the information she needed to make new deals but that was always the end goal. ,BigBrother,cvafdz8,11,t5_2r4zz

I dont think any one deserves anything more than anyone thats been my point all along. Had Vanessa made it to the final  over Steve I would say she deserved it more than Steve because to me the best player is the one who survives not the one who conspires.How can you say someone is a better player if they walk away empty handed? Thats like saying someone who places th in a hurdles race was the best runner because they jumped the hurdles with more flair than anyone else.From the get go I said its a matter of opinion and basically have argued that we can both be right because we both look at the game from different perspectives. p.s.

5249497,0,t1_cvikf6i,gtYou probably confused it with the vote where we had to decide between Risha and Pillar in the first week having only had like  or  episodes to actually get to know them.    That was it. That was a really dumb idea to give viewers that much power.  I couldnt help but feel bad for her and Pillar. It just seems down right mean telling someone there the least liked based on first impressions. Then your evicted and have to sit there and be asked by NotJulie what you think of being disliked by all the viewers.  That was pure cringe.  Its hard enough trying to find interesting people to put on the show even then some of them turn out to be duds and some of the ones who make for good tv are hated by the viewers but never the less make the show interesting. So why on earth would you allow the viewers to so drastically alter the course of the entire game by eliminating someone who could of potentially turned out to be an interesting HG not saying that Risha was and in all likelyhood she would of gotten evicted early regardless but still we will never know.       Edit What if it had been Pillar or kevin zack godfreed? Since most viewers didnt even know who they were voting for it could of been anyone. I guess the solution would be to hold the vote later in the game but then it would of givin the viewers even more power by breaking up alliances and swinging numbers advantages. Which brings me back to my point that it was a dumb idea that should of been tossed.,BigBrother,cvir4lk,0,t5_2r4zz

6087661,0,t3_3yxpv0,In retrospect Zachs approach in BB was a smart way to play it.  He recognized it meant nothing but he was hoping to curry favor with the Jameka by flattering her a little bit.  He was counting on her not really thinking past the surface flattery.  It wasnt a bad play and it may have helped him win some favor with Jameka.  Nominating DickDanielle whether they took offense or not couldnt hurt him in any way.  Neither of them would have taken him to the final two and neither of them would have voted for him if he had made it there himself.

6420211,0,t3_43l8zr,I didnt particularly like her while I was watching BB either but whether you like her or not you have to admit she played a stellar game. Vanessa managed to control every single eviction besides the first couple of weeks where she was laying low and when in jeopardy when Becky was targeting her she managed to convince the Goblins and the whole house to keep her over Shelli. She did a fantastic job positioning herself throughout the whole game people knew she was a strong player but never targeted her because of it.

Coincidental that they won one after the other. I feel like Vanessa was all Sarah did right and wrong but amplified.

For those unfamiliar divide the houseguests in to  teams compete in a mini comp then the winning team gets split in half and so on until the final  battle  on .

If he attacked anyone I would guess Dallas because later on Dallas kind of apologized to Mitch plus we know that Mitch doesnt really like Dallas at all. He expressed to Tim and Nikki maybe others too? that his boyfriend wasnt a big fan of the show because it can exploit the weaknessesmental issues of people. Mitchs sister is also a psychotherapist she has been on his youtube channel and we saw him weeks ago upset about Nikki being exploited for her instability. I think he is concerned about damaging his reputation by being on what some perceive as a trashy show. Since he makes his living on youtube it makes sense that he is more concerned about public perception than others. ,BigBrother,d18adg5,12,t5_2r4zz

Meanwhile the entirety of Jareds gameplay consists of him either giving highfives or letting peasants worship him and if that doesnt work threatening them or making personal attacks.The funniest thing about all this is that a lot of the house was intimidated by the concept of Jared which he couldve easily exploited to cause some serious damage in the game.

7427210,0,t1_d2mee15,Alright pointdexter let me break this down for you. There are sub categories of comps or three main categories. Sub categories include physical amp mental amp mix so under physical we have endurance accuracy etc. Then we have mental comps including memory true or false etc. Then the mixed category that mixes the two eg the ones where you run back and forth the gather letters to spell a word or something. You could even say there is a chance category like the ones where they throw a ball down a roulette table.

7430549,0,t3_4h1m1i,Watching the feeds last season was absolutely horrible. When they werent talking shit behind others backs they were in a big group talking about past seasons every night....Risha NASindy was a horrible gameplayer that talked way too much but she was quite entertaining I thought pretty intelligent and tried to make things happen on the feeds her games energy etc.Naeha  overrated. She gave off a hardcore gameplayer vibe right from the start. Pretty boring on feeds.Graig  Kind of gave up at the end but was entertaining in power. Dissapointment. Big ego but nowhere near some alpha male egos Tom Andrew etc.Johnny  bleh. No real contribution to anything.Jordan  Entertaining with his gameplay initially with all his deals. Horrible to listen on the feeds with his awful impressions talking about past seasons nonstop I so enjoyed his blindside....Bobby  The worst kind of player. Unmemorable reluctant to make a move until basically hit over the head with it...Kevin  Suprisingly bad read on the house a lot of the time. Kind of got too caught up in the showmance thing and stuck too close to the diapers...Pretty boring overall IMO and should not have been the narrator chosen by production..Willow  I thought she was quite entertaining on the feeds. She had some funny oneliners and energy which was badly needed in that cast. A little much at time with her emotional swings and got too attached to certain people that clouded her judgement at timesBruno  Smart guy knew when to make a move... I still feel like he is the nd best player of the season got royally screwed by the twist. Pretty boring on feeds. At least he had some game.Zach  Huge ego. Full of himself and a poor player. Would be a great villain if he wasnt so boring and nonconfrontational. Pilar  She was scatterbrained but not in a fun way like a Talla. PRetty boring IMO as well. She didnt have one clue how to play the game.Brittnee  poor gameplayer. Boring on feeds cried and bitched a lot.  Other than being an underdog I dont get why people loved her. The fact that people are talking about her as a choice for allstars is a fucking waste IMO. Ashleigh  Boring as fuck. Slightly functional gameplayer but maybe too camera shy or something. Whatever. She was a dud.Sarah  I liked her on the feeds when she wasnt being condescending as hell. Overrated gamer.Godfrey  Should have been the star of the show. Editors fucked him big time.

For that cast for some reason every person in there trusted him highly. He had a great strategy to pop into rooms all the time leaving things all over to know what people are talking about. I remember them mentioning several seasons after to watch out for Andy like characters.... He had a great strategy and executed it well and wasnt in a lot of danger but still had an influence on the game and manipulated... not a floater.I also thought he was entertaining and a lot of the Elissa humor was just darker. Some people like it some people dont...but they made him out to be a giant asshole when he really wasnt...Some of his flaws though Since that seems to be one of your questions The first couple weeks he trusted Spencer like A LOT....before the Moving Company was discovered. I remember Candice bringing it up in the havenot room that the guys could be aligned Helen shot it down Andy shot it down... then McCrae revealed it and Andy was crying about being played..... That was the last time I thought he looked naive or week in the game but he was for a little... But Dan had a rough start S Will had a rough start S... so I give him some slack there.....but it showed he wasnt the best at reading the game....and just a correction. Andy didnt start the Exterminators. That was actually Judd came back in talked with Spencer bc he saw that Spencer was alone at that point and they both wanted to work together then Judd approached Andy with Spencers approval bc of how tight they were Judd didnt trust Andy right away remember that... about working together thats why Andy thinks that him and Judd started it ... and then Andy Judd Spencer and GM met late one night and formed it.

Tim has just been a chill manipulator and phil said it best he just alters his thoughts depending on who hes speaking to.

But then suddenly Cass mocks Kelsey during Kelseys speech. Cass is just an immature girl who thinks shes better than the game and the people in it.Say what you want about Kelsey as a player but she sticks by her friends no matter what and she expects the same in return. Its not simply about not getting Casss vote its about what that means to Kelsey. To Kelsey you vote for your best friend in the end like Raul and Jared did so because Cassandra didnt vote for her it must mean they arent friends. Its not bitterness its just how Kelsey views the situation.But all of this is probably blown over since this video was recorded.,BigBrother,d3779yi,3,t5_2r4zz

Raul because we were gay friends Jared because of loyalty Maddy because she looked up to me and Nikki because we loved each other.

8095068,0,t1_d4plskf,Sigh. He might be a little but I think everyone is blowing it way out of proportion.Josea came onto him in a VERY sexual assault type of way and wouldnt take no for an answer and Corey worried his refusal of him would be seen as homophobic to feeders. Thats what got this whole thing started. Since then hes talked about it some let a guy spit water into his own mouth during truth or dare he was just playing the game and a few other small things.Corey is from Texas so isnt use to dealing with homosexual men hitting on him. He also coaches a baseball team and I can  guarantee you that if his player thought he actually was gay it would affect his teamcause him to lose kids. So while some people here love to interpret everything he does as being gay I think his awkwardness about the topic can be explained from lack of experience with gay men and his fear of being labeled gay is likely because of how that would affect him personally back home.Production definately likes the joke based on how they edited his complimenting pauliesFranks bodies which isnt gay straight dudes who work out compliment each other all the time and he side glances which probably werent even at them. But thats my  cents. Honestly Corey isnt that nice of a person and hes already shown hes republican. Those  things are enough to make fans here attack him on things hes sensitive aboutEDIT The downvotes without any comments explaining why Im wrong are only proving the this sub is biased theory is correct.

When Paul was insulting Michelles appearance saying she looked like Buzz Lightyear she responded with aw Paul she is pretty! She looks like a mermaid! And when they started to insult Michelles intelligence she said she thought Michelle was very very smart. Mad respect to these two ladies for how they handled themselves last night.

We are watching them do that for the first couple weeks and as we know things can change quickly.The fact that there are already polarizing views in the house is interesting to me. I think this is one of the most entertaining first set of nominations and eviction Glenn wasnt nominated that we have seen in a while. Im in between on the cast right now but I am definitely interested in watching what happens moving forward. It bothers me when people bring up the worst season ever because I think that phrase is different for everyone depending on what they are looking to get out of the show. Do they just want it to be entertaining? Are they interested unpredictable nomsevictions? Do they want to see backstabbing? Do they want to see game strategy talked out to feeders? In a way I think we all have different things we want to get out of the show.,BigBrother,d4twlnx,1,t5_2r4zz

8139005,0,t1_d4uwv2x,gtEating more healthfully and being more active are going to have health benefits regardless of weight loss.No disagreement here. gtPutting the main focus on weight loss often discourages people and gives credence to the idea that being fat much like being poor is because of moral failings. I dont buy into that system any more and it rustles a lot of jimmies.A lot of disagreement here. I dont think people really consider being overweight a moral dilemma in this country thin or not.  If it was  percent of people would not be overweight but they are.   If there is a system in place its a system that doesnt discourage bad eating enough.  Especially when you consider corporate companies and food places make it liveable to eat these high fathigh sugar diets by giving you enough minerals and vitamins to live and not see immediate damage.  Which happens eventually as bared out by the numbers.  Other countries place an emphasis on health and teaching it and how to be a healthy weight and as a consequence they tend to live longer.  This is something that america should thrive in.  But unfortunately the education is lacking in that department here and America made it really hard to eat healthy on accident.  Our wheatbread is still enriched basically tan white bread and our white bread is cake without frosting.  People slather fats and butters on their fruits and vegetables.  I am glad you are choosing to eat healthier now but to take the next step in healthy eating weight does matter and your body joints etc will thank you for it when you are older. ,BigBrother,d4ux65b,1,t5_2r4zz

Tiffany isnt even looking Bridgettes way and even tried forming a bond with her. Now as for the house getting out Tiffany on this HOH would be a hge mistake for a few reasons It gives Frank what he wants thereby strengthening Frank. You know who Tiffany is coming after Frank. Keep Tiffany in as a weapon. If you know where someones head is at and they are predictable they are worth keeping in the game.

Earlier James told Paulie that Tiffany would probably give Frank his stiffest competition. I think Paulie also realized that most of his allies wanted to keep Tiffany.Michelle had a good talk with Corey and laid out for Paulie the reasons to keep Tiffany. She  also straight up told Paulie With or without you we have the votes.Most of them dont see her as a big threat. They dont think shes coming after them in the short term. Corey thinks that she has a terrible social game.In my view Tiffany hasnt proven herself to be much of a comp or strategic threat either.

As for talking in groups look at Zakiyah. You stay quiet in the hopes you get info. Third Ive seen Tiffany laugh. Not huge giant laughs but I dont do huge giant laughs either and Im not depressed or socially anxious.

I also feel like she could have nicely mentioned that it made her uncomfortable from the get go and it wouldnt have been such a huge thing. Why is it either blow or or say nothing?

They discussed how they dont think DaVonne can win comps. And this is now the third time Tiffany has been on the block so they dont want to keep giving her chances to stay out of fear it will come back to bite them. So the decision was made to evict Tiffany.Of course it ended with James saying let me know if yall change your minds.

The point is to get  people from different walks of life with different experiences and viewpoints to come together and coexist in a house. Eric Stein said it best they dont cast  super fans for the same reason they dont cast  LA bartenders and thats because there would be too much similarity. And the dirty secret is most super fans arent that interesting and dont make for compelling television Adam Poch McCrae amp Spencer Ian Christine amp Nicole Steve Michelle.

The Outback one in BBUS was basically We won! Lets all go to Outback whereas the BBCAN sponsorships are used to make a better comp typically. If it results in a better competition who cares?The Divergent HoH was a great comp. Actually unique and interesting to watch. I would MUCH rather that than seeing the same comp from a previous season that the HGs already know how to beat effectively.Lets not kid ourselves.

8443391,0,t3_4vaxa1,Honestly I feel like I have to root for her.I miss BB Nicole. I completely adored her in BB even if she talked a bit of shit with Christine.BB was the first time I dedicated time to the live feeds so I fondly remember the underdogs like Donny and Nicole.Nicole was so sweet I felt. I just loved her so goddamn much. I still remember almost crying along with her when Hayen was blindsided. I still remember jumping for joy when she won the buyback. It was such a great moment as Nicole fan.I even remember voting for Nicole as much as possible to win AFP and being thrilled that she managed to make the top three vote getters.Nicole started this season of greatly IMO. But I am so disappointed in her being with the mean girls and choosing a boy AGAIN over the game.  even though I dont mind Nicorey So my answer would probably just be that I have such fond memories of Nicole in BB that I am finding it hard to cut ties and let her go as a favourite of mine.It is just hard. And that is why I woulf still consider myself a fan of hers. I am still rooting for her in a way but definitely not as much as the likes of Nat and Bridge.,BigBrother,d5wynpe,26,t5_2r4zz
8443474,0,t3_4v7c4f,Wow I couldnt even read through all of that because the behavior is just too atrocious. I cant believe day actually had the nerve to cry about Frank slapping her butt bc she was worried what it should show her daughter but is perfectly ok teaching her daughter to bully others. It makes the whole Frank butt slap thing seem even more disingenuous. If day was really worried about what she was teaching her daughter she might be more mindful about her own actions which she has control over and how she is teaching her daughter it is ok to disrespect other women. This is the exactly the type of behavior and mentality that perpetuates insecurity and more bullying  insecurity and jealous that we see from Michelle and zakiyah. These girls may feel all big and cool now running with the majority of the house but hopefully these actions will catch up to them outside of the house and they can feel some sense of realization for how petty and cruel they are. Going out of their way to celebrate a stuffed animals birthday over another human beings in the house  good job girls! So sad.

8447109,0,t3_4vcaoo,I am a big fan of the show but I had skipped BB besides the finale along with a few other seasons around those years. Watching Frank Eudy this year made me regret skipping it! He seems like such a funny positive man with good ol fashioned southern charm. You can also see he learned from some of the best Boogie Dan etc. on how to treat the game as just what it is.. a game. My favorite Frank moment this year was just in his final moments how he fought to save himself. And the absolute morons getting mad at him for PLAYING THE GAME. It makes me sad that he had to come back into this cast... they are almost as bad as season  when it comes to lack of understanding how BB is played. That being said his social game was by no means good and a real player like Dr Will Dan or Derrick would have found a way to even herd these sheep.

8526263,0,t1_d67bi7p,Dans Funeral Dan needs to win the veto to save himself but loses the competition and has to do  hours of solitary confinement as punishment. Dan uses the punishment as a blessing in disguise to develop a master plan. He holds a house meeting that he calls the death of himself as a player in this game. he says nice things about every houseguest says his game ends here and he wants to have fun for the rest of the week. however he throws his known  ally Danielle under the bus which makes her cry because she didnt actually do anything and everyone feels so bad for danielle that no one would vote her out. while the commotion with danielle is happening dan takes frank up stairs and blows up his alliance the quack pack and makes a deal with frank and jenn to use the veto on him. Jenn uses the veto frank backdoors britney britney goes home and Dan goes out of BB making the best play in big brother history. thats just the immediate effect. that move also effected future weeks but its very in depth.Replacement Nominee Roulette Dan convinces Ollie to throw HoH to him in exchange for letting Ollie basically do everything just so dan can see his girlfriend. However Dan sets up an elaborate game to draw the line in the sand. at the veto meeting he tells every houseguest to say who they want to be put up and if you refuse you go up on the block. the two sides of the house say each others names and basically the target on dans back was erased because the two sides now clearly are going after each other. Dan backdoors michelle ollies  ally at that point in the game. ,BigBrother,d67cgmg,7,t5_2r4zz
8526434,0,t1_d67d76u,I considered that but since the  swings were equally spaced apart it would be too simple of en explanation to just say there were  slots.If there were enough slots to accommodate a  person challenge or a  person challenge then that would mean they would need  slots as if you overlay a circle cut in ths with a circle cut in ths the most that you can make align is just  line.Because of this assuming that they set up the challenge for  people after they saw Bridgette was not evicted they wouldve needed to dismantle  of the  swings and reattach  swings to make  perfectly spaced swings. Making a total of  actions to perform in the time between the eviction and letting the competitors go to the backyard.Considering the fact that they would want to make sure none of the swings became disattached during the challenge I dont think that the time they had to work with wouldve been enough to accommodate either  or  people with only a few minutes notice as to how many total people would be competing.,BigBrother,d67d8ei,-4,t5_2r4zz

The guy is misogynistic plain and simple.gtAnd once again changing the subject or agreeing doesnt AT ALL have the same effect.Dont accuse me of not reading what you said because you forgot what you said thoughFor Paulie to be a misogynist he needs to feel that way about all women. Does he?If he thinks Z is nothing but a fucktoy you could see him as an asshole but if he only sees her like that it is what it is the opposite of misogynistic and he is judging people individually.Just like not liking a particular black person doesnt make you racist.,BigBrother,d6ah50p,2,t5_2r4zz

Now I amhappy with the fact shes doing right towards Bridgette and playing the game and not to mention making great feeds.Paulie I was neutral about him  at the beginning early on.  I did not like Cody but was not going to paint Paulie with the same brush.  From about the nd week he rubbed me the wrong way and I didnt care for his behavior.  He has not done anything so that caused me to change my opinion if anything hes solidified it.

Which makes sense Nicole doesnt make the show often but when she does shes made to look like the adorable kinda stupid but silly girl. ,BigBrother,d6f5ufm,0,t5_2r4zz
8588610,0,t1_d6eupo7,I think many of the HGs that season were weak willed or idiots. Now that isnt a knock on Derricks game at all if theres one argument I hate more its so and so only played with idiots and thats why they won but I just cant ever in my mind give credit to players like Donny or Nicole after they had the chance to save the season and so absurdly pissed it away due to their horrendously bad gameplay. Hayden I dont recall ever doing anything of note ever. Christine was much like Nicole this season carried along as a number with no real power and dumped the second she wasnt needed.I think the twists were really working against them that season BOTB in particular the worst twist in BB history Team America etc... which made the cast look even dumber than they really were but it was a really weak cast in my eyes.,BigBrother,d6f5yhq,4,t5_2r4zz

Big Brother is a solo game while you can and should work with other people you need to be selfinterested in order to play the game well.

8626147,0,t3_4xx3xw,I think Natalie is the type of person who works hard at being nice since she draws attention to it quite a bit. In my experience for people who are genuinely nice they dont often mention it because its natural behaviour for them and it doesnt really occur to them that they could act differently. She seems very aware of her image and the cameras and it does make me wonder what shes like without the camera presence. I do agree that shes been bothered by Paulie for awhile and I do think that there was a certain amount of calculation on her part in bringing it up to James. Whether she kept quiet before because she knew that she was flirtatious herself or whether she didnt want to cause a conflict I dont know. ,BigBrother,d6jvdvh,2,t5_2r4zz

The villain of the season for me was Jerry truly an awful bitter old man. I was shocked at the vile crap he would regularly spew. I think he is one of the biggest assholes theyve ever cast.

8696001,0,t1_d6sc9yg,gtHey that person was on a reality show lets put them in charge of handling the health of other people.You dont seem to understand what that career field entails.  Essentially they send reps to medical practitioners and healthcare operators to entice sales of specific drugs and devices over other brands not to handle the health of people.  Its basically a corporate schmoozing gig but in the medical field.  Maybe youre just too young or too inexperienced to understand how these things work but its a very common sales practice and people with some form of celebrity status or dazzling good looks are often employed in the job.As to your other points I mean yeah obviously I think television fame can be personally lucrative why else would I be making these claims? Youre simply too short sighted if you dont see the obvious ways in which public fame and notoriety can influence the growth of personal wealth and countless career fields including the ones Ive already listed.  Another example from this year would be Paul. It seems pretty obvious that hes hoping to use his fame from Big Brother to bolster his fashion labels standing with the public. Is he going to become the next Ralph Lauren? No but certainly more people will become aware of his label and doors or opportunities with investors that would have been closed to him prior to Big Brother will now be more easily opened.I dont really know what youre after here by repeatedly coming back at me with No I dont think this is true.

8833569,0,t1_d79mj5j,Thats great that youve enjoyed the season and youre definitely not the only person who feels this way. For me there has been a complete lack of strategic players and too much poor gameplay. Drama wise sure there has been a little but its nothing compared to what we used to get with Big Brother. And yes there have been some power shifts but theyve mostly been house power shifts. We saw everyone go from targeting Jozea to Victor to Tiffany to Frank and finally to DaVonne. Then we got the first big alliance power shift of the season when Natalie Bridgette James Paul Victor and Michelle agreed to target Paulie and sent Zakiyah home. The house was then fine with taking Bridgette out in the double which was really uneventful and awful and the following week Paulie was evicted unanimously. Natalie won HOH and turned on PV because Nicole convinced her with a lie about something Paulie said and then Victor got evicted for the second time. Vic returns and Nicole goes for the easy week by taking out Michelle. So the only REAL power shifts I see are Paulie being betrayed by Victor and Paul guys alliance is destroyed Natalie turning on the Ducks with James Michelle and NiCorey and then NiCorey flipping to work with Paul and Victor. Thats cool if you like power shifts that involve everyone turning on one person and agreeing to vote them out but I cant stand it.Victor returning twice was kind of fun but again the season has been plagued with too many fucking twists. Returning players siblings Road Kill teams just to keep the returnees safe prejury battle back Roundtrip Ticket  weeks of care package bullshit and the jury battle back. Its too much and is a huge reason I cant say this season has been good.Casting another reason this season has stunk for me. Jozea was a typical st or nd boot. Victor was awful until he came back the first time. Bronte did nothing. Tiffany was a train wreck with a lot of potential. Frank played the same game again and was a let down. DaVonne was a complete mess and a let down. Zakiyah was HORRIBLE and might be worse than Veronica. Bridgette was a disappointment that just baked . Paulie turned out to be a good casting choice because he played a good game up until everything blew up in his face. Michelle didnt do anything for over half the season until she shit on Paulie and Paul. James has been a major disappointment and has slept the season away. Natalie ended up being one of the better casting choices especially because most people thought she would be Veronica . before the season started. Corey? What the fuck has Corey done other than lay in bed and be boring? Nicole has played a fine game but she just got in a showmance again and has been pretty boring. And then we have Paul who in my opinion has been one of the best casting choices in recent memory. Great social game good strategic game for the most part very funny and has kept the season interesting for me. Because if Paul was voted out early I would have checked out.And finally the showmances. Holy shit does this just kill Big Brother seasons for me. One in a season? Fine I can deal with it. FUCKING THREE? This is what really ruined BB for me because CBS makes them the centre of almost every fucking episode and storyline throughout the season and it drives me absolutely insane. Then theyre all over the feeds all season and it really hampers strategic players because you cant just approach one half of a showmance. ,BigBrother,d79o5zq,2,t5_2r4zz

8884974,0,t3_51vx3f,A start of an idea...For veto A money blowing machine like a phone booth amp once HG is closed inside air blows papers around. Each HG goes in individually. Instead of money the machine blows slips of paper with HGs names. The HG grabs whatever slips they can amp stuff into a bag being as selective as they want in choosing only their own name or any names they would give veto to nicole could grab any that say nicole or Corey if she is ok with either her or Corey winning. They can grab and read the slips amp toss back in the wind if they dont want it in their bag. Not sure how much time to give them  secs?  min?After the slips are tallied and the HG with their name on the most slips wins veto. There could be money and prizes also on some slips.on nd thought Maybe not fair to be able to choose multiple names so maybe dont do it that way. alternative some slips have prize  name. So the HG playing would win that prize but only if willing to put it in their bag amp give the HG name a veto vote. alternative alternative  stuff the papers out of a small hole in the booth. Can only put a certain amount through when that  is reached this limits the effect of grabbing  names the CoreyNicole situation above or time expires the slips are tallied. That way they are locked in with whatever goes through the holemistake or not.would like to see it for HOH but i dont know if they do individual HOH comps. not sure what to do in case of a tie,BigBrother,d7fujzt,2,t5_2r4zz

But it wasnt until he started making noise this season that I looked him up and saw all the controversy about him allegedly cheating in his first season and also learned that his dad is Sid Vicious.

Look at how this entire argument started a passive aggressive comment from Michelle. Then when Paulie reacted to it DaVonne immediately jumped on it. Paulie is a douche but how does he possibly win in that scenario? People were constantly throwing passive aggressive comments towards him and Z and the second he bites he gets an earful.These girls are  doing this for the cameras. Whenever the cameras are rolling during jury segment day theyre willing to throw these passive aggressive jabs at Paulie knowing that. Its being filmed. Paulies going to react to defend himself. Paulie is outnumberedOut of everything shown Paulie has never once started any of the jury arguments. Its ALWAYS one of the other girls making these jabs trying to maximize their TV time.I dont like Paulie at all and his comments in the BB house were disgusting but Im not going to just pretend that the way hes being treated in jury isnt totally unfair just because he was a piece of shit in the BB house,BigBrother,d7nwum3,59,t5_2r4zz

8956948,0,t1_d7ntf9j,How so exactly? Bear in mind Vanessa played in the season directly after Derrick where everyone in her house was on high alert for another Derrick like the Russell Hantz effect in Survivor and she still controlled most of the game. You can argue that its because both Cody and Victoria wouldve taken him to the end but that ignores that every BB HG had just watched Cody give up  to Derrick before they entered the house in sequester. Flip the scenarios BB is now BB Steve takes Vanessa who has just dominated the game to the end Vanessa wins  and Steve gets the same amount of shit Cody got for handing away an easy win. Now BB is now BB does Cody still take Derrick to the end? Does Derrick even have as easy of a road given that everyone would be on the look out for another Vanessa and not another Andy? This additionally ignores that Derrick also played against much weaker competition than Vanessa and was given  free allies in Team America for no other reason than America liked him th most out of  people.,BigBrother,d7ohooe,0,t5_2r4zz

I know he also spent some time in law school was interested in business and now is an investor in several and always had a bug for showbiz so he is very used to dealing with different types of people in different stressful fields.

9036859,1,t1_d7xlszo,I like how all these people are giving her credit for stuff she didnt do now that she is the winner. Laying low for the first half was fine and she did somewhat good at it still was called a snake. So fast forward to the action. After the house flips on Paulie during the Zakiyah eviction no one told her what was going to happen. This shows that no one trusted her besides Corey although he didnt even tell her about the Executives and maybe Paulie? always say how she was coreys  and easy to cut. So really she had like  and a half people who trusted her....thats not good gameplay. On that DE night Corey wins the second HOH in the DE lucky for them and they send Bridgette home. Coreys win keeps the target off them for the next week since everyones gunning for Paulie. So up to this point Nicole has done nothing but lay low and has made no moves. She said she used the guys to get what she wanted but thats straight bs. Paulie controlled that house until he was evicted so now we move on to when hes out of the house to her supposed step up in game. After Paulie leaves Natalie wins HOH and wants to put up Paul and Vic which Nicole takes credit for and her fans give her credit for influencing that....No. Paulie was the one who convinced Natalie to distrust Pail and Vic and Paul and Vic were big targets anyways. So Natalie wins and Michelle gets co HOH and specifically last night Nicole said she got michelle to put up Paul or Vic... hahahahahahah. That was natalie who was influenced by Paulie and her own game to protect James not you. Nicole did nothing to influence Michelles decision. I dont even think Nicole even suggested to Michelle to put up PaulVic. Even if she did Michelle wouldnt ever listen to a word she says and stated that fact. So after Vic gets evicted he comes back and this is a god sent gift to Nicole. A comp beast now is on her side with another comp beast with him paul. Pure luck. If Vic had not come back then it probably would not have looked good for Nicorey. They would have been outnumbered and Paul would have probably gone with the majority meech and Jatalie. Anyways she did not influence Vic to join them he just hated Jatalie for not being loyal. In fact it was the opposite. Vic and Paul were mad at Jatalie for taking out Vic so they wanted revenge. So they MANIPULATED NICOLE into aligning with them and taking out Michelle instead of them she manipulated no one and once again coasted with the flow. Nicole has done nothing to this point but coast. So Nicole wins debate over whether james could have held on or he threw it the HOH and decides to take Michelle out. Wow! What a good move! Actually it was an arguably good move but she definitely did it for personal reasons. This is evident by the fact that when michelle was yelling when she was evicted Nice said Thats why youre gone. The truth comes out when people are angry. Paul and Vic were a gigantically bigger threat than Michelle yet she takes out Michelle...The argument she could have made that if she took out SD then it would be v Jatalie michelle and Paul v nicorey but I never heard her say that. So after michelle goes home the revenge minded Victor wins HOH and obviously puts up Jatalie. Again Nicole likes to take credit for this....but yet again she had  influence. Victor just wanted revenge. So after natalie goes home the gods bless nicole once again and Corey wins HOH. And she says lets make a big move! Putting up the two best competitors in the house in FINAL FIVE is not a big move...maybe in final  just maybe it would be big. But no derp you put up the strongest competitors. Even corey said this in the backyard interviews! Again nicole has manipulated no one and has done nothing. So Vic goes home again and Paul wins HOH and puts Nicorey up. This is where Paul starts messing up. Its always an endurance comp first and you or james will definitely beat corey in it. The third is always questions and its a crap shoot. So whats the benefit of keeping the person with the perception of played a good game nicole over the perceived do nothinger corey? None. A terrible move by paul and james. So corey goes home and Paul obviously wins final HOH. Once again Paul makes a terrible move and luck is on Nicoles side. He sends James home for who knows the true reason and keeps Nicole. A terrible move as mentioned above. Once again Nicole influenced no one. So by the stroke of several lucky turns Nicole makes it to final  and gets one last stroke of luck. Corey Paulie and Z Paulies lapdog will obviously vote Nicole and Victor and Michelle will obviously vote Paul. So that leaves James Bridge Nat and Da. James is a crap shoot but chooses Paul probably because he knew he played better and felt betrayed by nicole who knows. So its . Bridgette respects the game strategy and votes Paul in spite of her women empowerment beliefs and I really like her for that. She did something the  other girls couldnt do and she was the most hardcore feminist. I really liked Nat up to this point but she messed that all up. The sole reason I can think of for her voting for Nicole is that she is a woman. Im pretty sure she said she would vote for the girl in the final  while she was in the house. Also James said she told him he would vote for the girl in the backyard interview. And that leaves Da. She is the one Im most disappointed in. Either she was really misinformed or she voted for the women. I think it was a little bit of both. She shouldnt even of had a vote because the jury is way to big...she hasnt been in that house for weeks and dosent have a clue about the inner gameplay. Anyways Nicole won because she was a girl. If Nicole were a man would she have won against Paul? I believe its a firm No. And thats quite sad. Im kinda happy Paul lost so we can see him again he is hilarious. Maybe a duo thing like will and boogie Cody derrick vic and Paul etc season but thats another topic back to the undeserving winner and not player of the year. Nicole definitely was not the worst winner ever and played an OK game but Paul should have beat Nicole though. She coasted through the first half and thats a great strategy but continued that to the end and did nothing. There was no manipulation on her part. She did win a few comps Ill give her credit...but all the final  did. One thing I can say about Nicole is at least she is not Michelle from survivor. The fact that that crappy jury gave her m is the saddest win on reality TV ever. It was embarrassing to us all that she won. But the Michelle in this survivor season i like she is cute.Id say Paul is the player of the year and will be invited back if he wants to play again. I hope he does too. Especially now that he knows how to play from the get go. In the end no one really had a strategy this year they just took it week by week. We havent seen a real strategist since Derrick....I feel like ones coming next season not OTP god knows what type of cast that will be if the Messiah and Jason are the returneee...and America picks the winner dumb Regardless good season.TLDR I basically went through every step of the game during and after the DE to show that Nicole did not manipulate anyone and that people are giving her credit where credit is not due.,BigBrother,d7y35ee,-3,t5_2r4zz

He won his way to the end but on a week by week basis it appeared he never got what he was incentivized to want. He survived  nominations but only  as the actual target and as far as wanting other people out specifically to help his game it looked like he never cared.,BigBrother,d7zje64,5,t5_2r4zz

He didnt let his allies get any say in any of his decisions. Every HOH he treated as if it were his own. A good Big Brother player would not treat his allies like dirt. Take Derrick for example Derrick made his allies sound like his decisions were their decisions. A good BB player would not have a downfall as delicious as Paules.

9299442,0,t3_57rz3n,Okay I am going to admit something and I hope Im not chastised for it.  This is my first time watching feeds.  Now I cannot say that this is the worst season in regards to the feeds but I can say that this is the most hypocrisy and selfrighteousness I have seen in my life.  I dont tend to post vitriolic comments but I do support and campaign for the Ballsmashers because they are what the LNJ claim to be more honest more entertaining more gamefocused and overall better people.  With respect to those who do post vitriolic comments I can understand why.  America is a part of this game.  When you think you have a voice or the ability to impact a game you love only to be outshouted by those who care less or perhaps have vastly different values than you it can be incredibly frustrating as Ive experienced in the last couple weeks.  I understand why you would feel the need to magnify every single instance that demonstrates your point.  If you cant make an impact by talking it feels easier to shout I fundamentally disagree with this but I understand that it feels that way.I found that hate Jason post to be a response to the vitriol thrown at Monte for saying something harmless.  Perhaps hate is too strong of a word but I understand and agree with the argument.  Monte got hate for what he said so why isnt Jason outside of reddit.  And there is much more content for which to hate Jason and the Jamboree than anything Monte did.  I feel like reddit is a great place to go compared to other sites.  It can get toxic when the sub is so overwhelmingly favoring one side but I still feel its the best place to voice and argue for your opinion.  Take your post as an example.  With a well thought out argument you can reach the top of the sub even when its criticising the previous  top posts.,BigBrother,d8urrfl,8,t5_2r4zz

9426438,0,t3_59o7oq,A lot of good answers here but I think Justin is playing an amazing game. Hes gone against his own alliance and still has not been targeted taking veto from Danielle.I think one of the most telling moves was last night after eviction. He and scott were talking in the HN room and Justin was telling Scott how heJustin had to vote with his alliance to keep their trust and didnt actually want Scott gone...which of course Scott ate up.How do you vote against someone then gain their trust  minutes later??Sidenote I also think hes winging the entire game and every decision which is fun as fuck to watch.,BigBrother,d9av6mn,1,t5_2r4zz

Im gonna try and remember all the amazing moments from that time LOL. It had a crazy vote flip the night of the youre as fake as those things on your chest. Bridgette Natalie and Michelle banning together and forming real bonds. Michelles  outfit changes and her crazy sob when Bridgette was evicted over her. The rise of the No Names alliance that got together to take Paulie out. All the fights with Paulie and him crying and moping and being crazy and refusing to bake pies. Paul and Nicoles fight where Corey stripped out of his patriotard. Paul and Pablo doing secret service. Victor flawlessly shutting down any argument Paulie tried to make and casually cleaning in the background during intense moments. The introduction of Baldwin the eagle skits Pauls houseguest roast that whole convo where they made fun of paulies perfect woman. And then Natalie and Michelles super awful HOH reign where they turned on Victor and Paul. Natalie immediately regretting her decision and crying and all of them staying up all night to study for veto. The storm veto comp being probably my favorite comp ever and Paul pulling out that clutch win.  The two of them coming up with that huge fake fight to try and get Victor to stay. It didnt work but damn it was entertaining. Victor getting evicted the lochness comp where Zakiyah and Davonne did a suicide pact jump Paulie wearing the shortest shorts possible and of course Victor coming back into the house. And we cant forget the jury segments aired during those weeks... amazing.  ,BigBrother,d9h66zt,24,t5_2r4zz

She needs to express she is disliked by America because of her association with Monte and Scott and that is why she was Americas nominee and at this point she is playing for second place knowing she can never win first. If I were her I would highlight that she is playing for second but she knows she would come in third since Kryssie has never been AN and was only a HN once.I dont know that Jason would go for it but since she is awkward in game talks at times maybe she can play up that her social game is such crap and she thinks that is why America may be disconnected with her and nominating her this week as well.,BigBrother,d9qrx9d,3,t5_2r4zz

9860769,0,t3_5gjrvm,I think some of what cost Jason the win was Nicole winning BB. I think that there are some people who are tired of returning players into game with newbies so some people voted against him. ... Yes Jason came in with a fan base but he seemed to get cocky after winning the last HOH figuring his fanbase would get him the win but when he started really bashing Justin I think that he turned off some of the people who would of voted for him once Justin was gone...  What also didnt help him was that it seemed that he thought that the feeds were off after the speeches. It was during the conversation that happened afterwards where Morgan brought up stuff she forgot to say plus Jason bringing up stuff she should of mentioned also...  I think that he also forgot about such podcast as The Big Brother Gossip Show and RHAPpy Hour were talking about things that had gone on in the house. BBGS plays clips of stuff that has gone on and RHappy Hour getting into conversations about the stuff in the house it permitted people to hear those shows without having to watch the feeds ...  I also think that him saying that he was such a huge Superfan and Historian in the end hurt him as their are some who wanted to bust his ego and wanted to let him know that he may have all of this knowledge about BB but his understanding of America and its thinking isnt that great.  ,BigBrother,dasvqgs,23,t5_2r4zz

If it was based on who was closer it would take producers a few more seconds to actually do the math to see who was closer. Youd have to sit there with a calculator and do    and then    and see which is smaller. Plus theres always the chance that they mess up the math in a hurry which would result in the wrong person being crowned.

Mitch was planning on targeting him amp Cass next and without the fake DE saving him hes in deep trouble with Raul winning that HOH where it would have been  on  to begin with.He also massively overplays his hand during the Pax Bros HOH by convincing them to target Jared then arbitrarily changes his mind and tells them to target Ramsey amp Maddy instead. This exposes him to all sides and turns both MaddyRamsey amp JaredKelsey against him and was completely unnecessary in the first place. His spot is blown up so bad he gets put up on the block that week by the Bros who had gone into the week being one of his closest allies. And if Ramsey doesnt quit that week he very likely goes home because of it. the Pax Bros wanted him out and KelseyJared were on board if they had the votes. Ramsey leaving took away a crucial vote they needed.Its only then that we get into the faults of not studying and quitting competitions.,BigBrother,dbpsc6m,17,t5_2r4zz

10371793,0,t3_5oibln,I would agree that in general we were really blessed with the female cast of BB especially after how horrendously bad the female cast was the prior season. I wouldnt necessarily say that every member of the cast brought something to the table I thought Jackie was a total bust and never had much of an opinion of Meg either. Becky was very eh to me but I will credit her for being the one person to dare to go after Vanessa. Davonne and Audrey were horrendous strategic players but I did find both wildly entertaining. I always enjoyed the twins generally respected Shelli and Vanessa is in a class all by herself. A top  female cast member of all time. Possibly a top  player of all time even without the win Ill admit Im biased. If Im looking at the whole picture gameplay entertainment value Id probably put Vanessa  all time among the female players as Im not as high on the more obvious choices like Janelle or Rachel.Vanessa was the biggest comp beast of the seson not Liz. Vanessas got  HOHs all of which were retained to Lizs   of which were retained. Vanessa had  more veto wins than Liz. Liz had a BOTB win Vanessa never playd in a BOTB comp.Is it the best female cast ever? Hmm. BB is probably the best there although as an All Stars season its not really fair to rate it against other seasons. Im also very high on the female cast of OTT. When you consider how much fun it was laughing at Kryssies ineptitude Id argue everyone but Neely at least brought something to the table. BBOTT also deserves credit for having the shows most successful all female alliance the only such alliance of more than  people where one of them won the game.,BigBrother,dcjpdth,5,t5_2r4zz

10399412,0,t3_5ow8rn,Sabrina   early Jury surprising everyone with how shes changed as a person and player. Neda Either mid prejury or goes super deep like final  or  and loses like Dr.Will in All Stars Topaz  At least final  again Cass  Probably prejury. Shes not good in comps but is dangerously good socially and strategically. Emmett  in the same boat as Neda I think one of them will go far and the other will go early theyre the biggest threats and best players there.Zach  Hes a guy who usually always makes at least jury. Jon  Midjury. Theyll be smarter this time he could win out.Mitch  Further than he went but short of the final .Tbh I think the people with a best chance on an AllStar season are Kevin BBCAN and people will hate that I say this but this is just my opinion and Peter BBCAN. If I were to bet I think one of those  would win.,BigBrother,dcmu8x8,6,t5_2r4zz

10538248,0,t3_5qu6su,I think what gets overlooked is the ground work that was put into that move. Vanessa had an accurate read on the house and thats why she was able to be believable. Austin had already led a failed coup against Vanessa where he tipped his hand that he thought he had an in with Johnny Mac and was comfortable working with him. The reason she was pissed at Steve was he was comfortable facilitating that play for Austin as opposed to ratting him out to her and letting her slay one of them to limit their options. So the boys revealed end game potential in her mind. Steve as HoH wanted to get out a twin. Johnny Mac and her quickly convince him the best way to go about that was the Austin Liz noms though with Steve hard to tell how much of his hesitance is for show. She knows Steve is selling it to Austin that shes not going to take a surprise shot at him and only have the twins. Shes obviously not going to tell him if shes planning that move and even if she is first priority is not being the veto replacement. So how can Austin throw the veto to either sister? Vanessa has told him shes not taking a shot but he cant know if she means it. Him and Steve have both wronged her in her eyes. If he throws it to Liz hes toast. If he throws it to Julia and she doesnt use it hes toast. Austins been talking with the boys to make sure hes good going forwards while Vanessas playing her good with everyone cause she just wants whats best for them game. The structure of the competition really helped out because it emphasized the variables at play.,BigBrother,dd2ml7z,5,t5_2r4zz

I will actually say Nicole changed her game a bit. She wasnt as much of a lamb being lead to slaughter her nd time around and wasnt really the underdog of the season. And when it DID seem like shed be next she actually successfully still dont know how she was a horrible liar pulled off lies to get someone else out. She was also pretty firm about not being a pawn. Not a fun game to watch and she lost a lot of peoples respect  especially because she clearly still has issues with other women although you could argue maybe that she was correct in knowing when to ditch the other girls  but she definitely played a quietly dominant game and it got her the win. ,BigBrother,destp62,27,t5_2r4zz

I could see how this twist was able to take advantage of the pretaped format to cut out the uncertainty of how long it might take someone to make a decision in a surprise twist like this one.    If it were done on BBUS they probably wouldnt be able to show us any of the initial votes and would have to end the show with the first HG entering the vault and Julie Chen telling us to tune in Sunday to see how everyone voted.   BBCan does have more flexibility in this way since their show is pretaped.  I definitely see you point of view! ,BigBrother,dfoq3tw,1,t5_2r4zz

Ive also not seen any actual acts like shes better thanabove people behaviour.I know fans are naturally bound to turn against a person who Is firmly in the power alliance controlling the whole game gets  weeks of safety to jury through popularity vote goes after popular entertaining underdogs ends up in a big feud with and boots one of the most popular players whos also a big underdog at that point is directly responsible for the evictions through comp wins and playKnowing BB fandom tendencies theres legitimately no chance Neda doesnt become massively less popular no matter how she acts in the house aside from those parameters. Gotta be realistic about that. But its unfortunate how much of a hate fest it has become with all sorts of behaviour getting put on Neda thats imo just not at all happening in the house.The hate has become so massively out of proportion to what Neda has actually done in the house its comical.,BigBrother,dfpcun0,14,t5_2r4zz
