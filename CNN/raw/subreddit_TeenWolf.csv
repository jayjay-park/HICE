Its the equivalent of allowing a company in the mall to stop you force you to fill out a questionnaire then generate revenue from your answers all because you walked by their store and looked at the ads in their window.Google and Facebook are notorious sites that use scrypts to collect data on your search history and location in order to tailor ads that pop up on websites specifically for you in order to generate higher revenue.Download no scrypts and set your default to clear your history every time you login so this type of intrusive bullshit is frowned upon.,TeenWolf,ceuvagt,1,t5_2sjll

207911,0,t1_cf20m4u,Hopefully youre right. The Nemeton being evil just doesnt seem right to me...always thought nature was a good thing lol. Stiles becoming a druid makes sense to me. Hes always been a good guy whos just been smart. The scene with the mountain ash in season  where he only had a handful left but made it work got me thinking though. Every pack had a druid even the Alpha Pack. Deatons retired or something which leaves Scotts pack without a connection to mother nature or whatever. Stiles is seemingly the only pure human in the group Allisons a huntress so ignored so i think theyre setting him up for that reveal. Unfortunately theres also the fact that someone or something is trying to kill Kira. Stiles being controlled or influenced somehow  could also be the Nemeton which could mean the Nemeton has a problem with Kira or her power. Theyve done an amazing job with b imo.

Killing off Dereks pack is an awful thing in my book but whatever. I also wouldnt call them enemies.Isaac Never and enemy as I was saying.Matt Yeah....Gerard Basically killed I fully believe he is only around so that Scott didnt kill someone and to give some sort of random scary character to the show when needed. Ennis Killed yeah.AidenEthan I agree alive. A lot like Peter though there is a lot of development they can give to the show.Deucalion Alive obviously. I dont know where they are going with this one. Hes either never coming back or he is. Either way hes EXTREMELY powerful and I think killing him off would have been extremely hard to pull off properly.By my count thats basically  male enemies  out of those  are alive one is still active as an enemy one is basically dead two have turned good.The females you haveKate Argent plot device for AllisonVictoria Argent plot device for AllisonErica not an enemyKali I think this is canceled out by Ennis honestly that pack was torn apart and we only have the twins because they fit in so well with the show and the main pack.And Jennifer She was a straight up killer and had to go.So yes I agree there is a discrepancies but more that there are FAR MORE male antagonists and only two real female ones.My conclusion would be that there is less of a survival rate issue and more of a lack of female enemies in the show.,TeenWolf,cfkv14y,1,t5_2sjll
411110,0,t3_1yrpkr,I agree with a lot of the points and theres obviously something going on with Allison. Possessed by another nogitsune sounds plausible though its funny that the starting point for this theory was the we thing because I think the episode made it pretty clear we referred to the nogitsune and Stiles. Why would it being directed at Stiles mean he wasnt part of the we? Stiles asks Who are you? nogitsune says Stiles should be asking Who are we? because the nogitsune is part of Stiles.,TeenWolf,cfndlx8,2,t5_2sjll

Umm Stiles should have just said how determined Donovan was killing him and he didnt kill him on purpose. He should have said while he was trying to escape from Donovan an accident happened and Donovan died.

He had the experience and understanding of his powers down better than the other betas. Issac once he gained control was also great and progressed rapidly.

4934183,0,t1_cugakzb,No we want Scott to actually deal with the threats he comes across. Letting people go and bygones be bygones isnt dealing with threats its plugging your ears and going lalala until everything solves itself hopefully or everybody else does something about it instead. In addition to actually looking out for his pack you know like an alpha.How is it prevailing through good when you refuse to do nothing and somehow due to external circumstances out of your control everything ends up alright. Is that the the true alpha way? Just let everybody off with a warning and cross your fingers that they wont be murdering fucks anymore? And hope that outside events come together and end up preventing the bad things from happening that way you dont have to do anything?No Im not gonna hold Deucalion accountable for everything he did even though he flat out told me that hell kill every living thing that gets in his way Im just gonna let him take off and trust that hes too scared of me to be evil anymore. No Im not gonna look out for my established packmates by being wary of newcomers because as their leader and alpha Im responsible for their safety and welfare just gonna trust this kid I havent seen since before I went through puberty. Whats that Theo? Stiles my brother from another mother brutally murdered somebody? Seems legit and ps thanks for the inhaler bro youre a lifesaver! ...Help help my packs in danger how did this happen who could have seen this coming?!Kira Im madly in love with you because like stuff and junk but Im not going to tell you about your kitsune going rogue because that would be hard. Sure you ended up running out and butchering someone which for some reason Im not as disgusted by as I am with Stiles and Donovan and now youre leaving but if I had said something we wouldnt get to romantically kiss in the rain.Oh no my betas lost control that I should have been working on with him for a while now especially with that supermoon coming.If hes going to be this incompetent why the fuck is he a true alpha to begin with?,TeenWolf,cughrcu,4,t5_2sjll

5066795,0,t3_3kddbu,Yeah its weird...I was kind of put off by him before his first episode even aired because even before the season started he was acting all cocky and the TW social media was kissing his ass and I was just like who even is this guy? Like I literally dont know who this guy is and he and the TW sites are acting like hes the second coming I dont get it.That said I have come to like his character in a way. At first he was irritating both because I didnt like Cody and because he was introduced as a rival for Liam but in later episodes he turned out to be a fairly cool character and theyre working hard to make him more likable so well support it if he gets together with Mason. Although it looks like they might be putting him with that other invisibility chimera kid who was attacked by his scorpion chimera boyfriend.Still not happy that he inherited Dereks family died in a fire except me and my sister storyline though.,TeenWolf,cuwqnmt,5,t5_2sjll

It has been an issue though in the past. Two instances come to mind because of the lighting. In season  people have reported seeing Scotts eyes flash red when Peter roared to make him shift. They werent red and it was stated to be a lighting problem. Still hasnt stopped people from saying Scott was going to be an alpha since season  and thats the proof.The other instance is in season  when Scott starts to look monstrous. The greenish tint caused many people to see his eyes look orangeish as opposed to their red color. That sparked a whole  Omg his eyes are orange!

7092854,0,t3_4co9ge,Is this even a legitimate source? The writing is poor and it seems like its just an article with info. taken from other articles. I dont think that Jeff actually made that . comment at all but whoever wrote this piece took other quotes of his and extrapolated it into something else. I wouldnt put much stock into what is written in this piece.  Also  they repeat the June premiere rumor when an actual MTV article stated the show would premier in the fall.EDIT he did say the . quote in the original TVLine article but the context makes it seem like its just a start  which is nothing new as weve all already speculated that a few of the original cast will probably leave after Season . If they want to continue the show they have no choice but to head in that direction. Heres the quote and I still hate the articles that are just conglomerates of other articles its TVLine gt Its about where the show and the characters are all headed as we start to hand things off to our . characters.

7207214,0,t1_d1x823s,The passive voice can be entirely unreliable and teen wolf constantly brings our attention to the unreliability of what we see.One of my favorite examples is when Scott wanted to attack everyone in night school it was so out of character for him he thought that it must be control from Peter but as soon as we met other new wolves we learned that without control they wanted to rip and tear and eat exactly like Scott in season this means Scott assumed and was wrongwe were presented Scotts dad through Scotts pov as horrible and when Stiles met him we continued this we saw him as a villain who hated the sheriff but in actuality hes one of the better people in the town. We were skewed by their perception because THEY are telling the story.Leverage is a perfect example of how the passive voice can be unreliable we see the episode happen and then at the end we see the reality of what happened and it shows what we saw was skewed.Teen Wolf is well written but not well written TV it trusts the audience to notice it doesnt point out lies so we believe them too it doesnt point out when assumptions are wrong. Bad people dont necessarily get their comeuppance the hero doesnt always save the day. This isnt MotW tv this is a huge arc its built like anime where there is one big story that has parts which are the seasons. So we might get that resolution seasons later.In pilot Scott nearly got run over when he stumbled into the road but it was revealed in the visions from the icebath that that car was driven by the argents and i went oh cute then i checked pilot and it IS the same car it is the car that Argent drives to the school. Thats the kind of detail the show puts in. Deucalion working with Scott works as a plot twist Gerard pulling a magic spear out of his ass with no warning is bad writing.TV often doesnt have these we treat TV as quickly consumed nonsense we put it on in the background whilst doing other things we catch random episodes of genre tv between doing other things like something to watch whilst eating dinner thats just interesting enough to engage but not clever enough to leave the audience behind.Teen Wolf doesnt do that its nonepisodic and it trusts its audience and the audience doesnt always get it but the techniques it uses are amazing just dont assume dont think the characters are right when they guess that they dont lie because theyre not called on it being a lie.Keep your eyes open trust nothing and youll find a fascinating show but not an easy one ,TeenWolf,d1xeioi,1,t5_2sjll

They were friendliest in Wolfsbane though we had to endure an excruciating coffee talk with Holland where these fans went on and on and on about hating Malia and it just got weird and uncomfortable.There were also some really bossy fans on the first morning who told us we had to write numbers on our hands and queue up behind them because they had been waiting to get photo session tickets since like midnight though the hotel staff were really pissed off because they were told not to do it and were blocking the door. I refused to but my friend asked me to play nice so I did. Weird stuff.All in all it can get a bit intense but its also really fun and you do usually end up making a couple of friends there.

Normally they seem to take about a  month break between the seasons and presuming A ends in January that timeframe might make sense.I guess it depends when they go into production but I imagine hell be able to make room for B okay.

10200895,0,t1_dc0b7ml,Sure he seems to be a Nazi scientist werewolf. He was probably in the tank because he was betrayed by colleagues somehow otherwise hed have been experimenting on the Wild Hunt himself. I mean the Dread Doctors who had him was trying to bring back some dead guy from somewhere. A Hellhound was involved and the whole thing was already related to the Wild Hunt. If Nazi guy wasnt in the tank he probably was already researching the Wild Hunt. Probably in France. Ostensibly to help Hitler find weapons or create supersoldiers or something. Hitler and paranormal weapons is a common enough trope. But he got betrayed before he could betray everyone himself.I wonder if he has a beef with the Wild Hunt or if hes talking to a specific Ghost Rider that used to be someone he knew and would have a beef with. His memories might have remained intact in the tank. I imagine if the person that betrayed him was taken by the hunt after The Wild Hunt would have shown up in Europe during the war surely and became a Ghost Rider and then unmasked there might be a specific grudge. Or hes been doing Nazi science specifically to recover his own Stiles. Ah well.,TeenWolf,dc0bu2s,1,t5_2sjll

10269845,0,t3_5n21pq,So Im going off kind of old memories from this happening before and Im not sure about your specific situation but usually services like Netflix will contract with a network channel to carry one of their shows for a certain amount of time usually  years iirc. After that if either side decides not to contract again then the show is pulled. They can also choose to do a partial contract i.e. Seasons  but not  this happened to the show Eureka and it drove me bonkers!. Sometimes there is a delay of a few months too so you might see it disappear only to pop up again a few months later. Im assuming it has to do with advertising and money and consumers watching on the network vs on demandnetflixHulu etc. so you may have to look elsewhere for your episodes for a while but Im pretty certain that it will eventually come back up on Netflix. If you have on demand or Amazon PrimeHulu you might be able to find them there or ...download...with some program I do not know about and am certainly not suggesting since it may or may not be illegal...Sorry I cant really help but I hope at least I was able to explain why you cant see them anymore. Edited also thought Id mention that shows tend to pop up a few monthsweeks before and after a new season is about to start.  They also tend to show up on demand then as well because they know this is the time when people will most likely be rewatching. ,TeenWolf,dc855w9,5,t5_2sjll

10587154,0,t3_5rk3de,Well technically... It was . Scott was fighting Nazi.BUt yes I agree. t was extremely far fetched believing that the three of them were able to do it. Epecially when riders have guns,TeenWolf,dd7zfbz,3,t5_2sjll
10587732,0,t1_dd69tj0,Im just glad that when I finally get taken Ill know the SOB was a nazi or not.,TeenWolf,dd81kle,2,t5_2sjll
10619357,0,t3_5ryvfd,Plans change. His plan was made because he was scared of them no longer being friends after high school.,TeenWolf,ddbb1jt,6,t5_2sjll
10648349,0,t3_5scy82,Considering Canaan seemed to be set quite a few years back from the current events its pretty likely that the ghost riders dont jump from town to town taking people but probably lie dormant for a while. I get where youre coming from but they couldnt be defeated really. ,TeenWolf,ddeamu9,5,t5_2sjll
10651099,0,t3_5sen0y,I agree. It was a little rushed. They could have elaborated on more things but then I think a bunch of people would complain that they are drawing out the season andstalking for Dylan O Brian to come back. But still this finale wasnt the best. So to answer some of the questions from what I gathered from the show. The ghost riders were probably attracted to beacon hills because the town attracts supernatural things. They are the wild hunt and rode the storm the storm probably took them to beacon hills like it did to all the other town they went to. The fight against the pack. Im thinking that they were able to either because they were in a pack sort of so that probably made them a little stronger and they had also been fighting ghost riders for a while so they might have some knowledge on how to fight them. OR since the ghost riders have been converting people they are all noob riders and are just a bad shot. Melissa and argent were indeed cringe. College and all that will be addressed in the next  episodes. They want to humanize Peter to use his character more.  Instead of him being a psycho all the time. And remember Stiles thought he was gone for a couple of days but it was  months times moves differently in the ghost rider world. Thats just what I got from all of it. Hope it helped a little or maybe not all all I dont know ,TeenWolf,ddekulj,5,t5_2sjll
10688912,0,t1_ddic2zg,Its how the writers go they forget about the others as soon as they are gone hence nothing about Jackson Isaac or Derek.,TeenWolf,ddihdjh,1,t5_2sjll
10903102,0,t1_de4a9fb,I read the same thing about the were tiger since its an actual mythological creature. I just assumed he wasnt one because he had no  claws or fangs just like you said. Also people especially in this sub Reddit would lose their shit if they made him a were tiger. But if that was true would the design be sublimate to Kate? Green eyes? Orange and black striped pattern instead of blue and black on the skin?,TeenWolf,de4ksr7,2,t5_2sjll
10999005,0,t1_decxvcc,Agreed here. Malia feels like the de facto female lead of the show in some aspects. Lydia has been reduced to being Stiles love interest and it kinda sucks,TeenWolf,deepcsx,6,t5_2sjll
11181223,0,t3_5zlui1,Seeing all of the actors writers crew members etc. posts is really sad. Im especially going to miss Melissas TW posts. It sucks to see that aspect of the show end as well. ,TeenWolf,dezdnm4,3,t5_2sjll
11254859,0,t1_df7iesl,He said when he did it it felt like it nearly killed him. And then he tried again two other times during season  and couldnt do it. One of those times he was poisoned and the other time he was literally in a wing of building completely made of mountain ash where the concentration of mountain ash was so high just being there made him feel weaker.,TeenWolf,df7pz4s,2,t5_2sjll
11366058,0,t3_61zwus,Stydia  how scotts character was portrayed character development sucks arcs that make no sense. How they decides to ruin Sciles for a ship. A ship that makes no sense. Their villain made no sense. Characters acted well out of character as if the writers forgot how they had written them beforehand. Leading fans on. And a LOT of waisted potential and incompetent writers. So...yeah...,TeenWolf,dfkbk7q,3,t5_2sjll
11405146,0,t1_dfoj928,Interesting it was quite the opposite for me. His emotional moments just were not that hard hitting for me. For example Tyler Posey at one point said before season b Scott would have an emotional break down and I just didnt see it? Was it where he was talking to his mum where he was upset about the pack? Was it where he had his panic attack? But they didnt seem like emotional break downs to me so I was confused. However with Dylan it was immediate that when I knew his character was having a break down just bam and I imminently felt for his character. While Tyler to me just got himself to look sad and lost puppy like well thats the only the emotional range I saw on him. His never lost it before like Stiles character has and I do think thats because Tyler doesnt have enough emotional range in his acting to pull it of. Like one of the big things in shows is for your main to have a big emotional break down and his friends there to pick them up. While that just hasnt happened with Tyler and I honestly think its because he doesnt have enough acting chops to pull it of. I think hed actually make a great presenter after teen wolf but an actor? I just cant see it. x,TeenWolf,dforbr7,2,t5_2sjll
