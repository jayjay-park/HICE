6545891,0,t1_czlh98z,Hey Ostrr! Sorry for the late reply but yes hopefully the new story NPC Sync combatanimation sync world sync will be all finished by the end of June. Playable beta that also has some decent syncing will be ready again hopefully by the month of April. We are going to announce our second phase of the project soon that will be heavily involving all of you the community to suggest anything youd like to see in this mod. Were looking to expand mod development and compatibility for ST. Much more details soon! ,SkyrimTogether,czwecju,1,t5_3bmxv
