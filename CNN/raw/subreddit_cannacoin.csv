1225437,0,t3_284ga0,Hey JaydGlad to see another familiar face over here.  Your dad is doing great work especially in a place like the UK which needs support with regard to legal MMJ.  In fact I just sent him a CCN donation.  I dont know offhand of a Cannacoin Accepted Here but I know that branding is one thing that we could use more of.  Hopefully someone chimes in with a version of an accepted here logo.  Subcreative has been hard at work on Cannacart which is a big leap forward  and so it would go naturally that we have some additional branding to go along with it.Hope you stick around and light one up with us.  Also be sure to stop by IRC at Cannacoin,cannacoin,ci7habv,1,t5_30fz5
