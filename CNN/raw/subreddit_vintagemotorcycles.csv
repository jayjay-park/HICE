823895,0,t3_23jnjf,You should be able to track down resistance values for your regrec and your rotor. Your regrec has  wires and they should have the same resistance between all combinations of wires. The stator is usually a more durable component than the rotor. I assume you did new brushes with the rotor?The difficult part about troubleshooting those is as the voltage and heat increases current can leak between the windings. You cant always see this with a multimeter because they have such a small current. This is most often a problem with the stator.,vintagemotorcycles,cgxxg2l,2,t5_2skny

10624608,0,t3_5s1jof,Are you sure its missing? Its hard to tell from the picture. Best way to tell is if theres any sideways play in the wheel. Prop it up on something so that the wheel is raised and see if it moves sideways at all.,vintagemotorcycles,ddbuihj,2,t5_2skny
