My solution works with a list of filepaths delimited by a newline.    .???.designer|.aspx.|?lt!.csgmWorking versionI dont code in .NET so you may have to alter it a little bit.

4567301,0,t3_3dd16y,I definitely agree that lookbehind is a useful feature. Currently we only have K to do variable length lookbehind but that is not wellknown and not exactly a convenient approach.The general problem is regular expressions are not reversible. E.g. finding a ?ltcomplexpattern requires a costly scanning. It is also not a trivial question whether the engine should scan forward or backward.From technical point of view this could be done but the scanning would be slow and people would not like that. Hence it would be a good idea to define a constrained way of doing variable length lookbehind. It would be good to discuss what is needed in practice and define certain rules.,regex,ct6bl8u,1,t5_2qr8f
4659963,0,t3_3eshk5,Try    azAZ.azAZ..azAZAfter the last period is found you are only asking to find one more character.  A quantifier character like  or  or  is needed so the regex engine knows to keep trying to match characters.This regex is very simple and wont capture many valid email addresses.  If your environment and MHTTXT files only contain a small subset of valid email addresses then youll be fine.  But remember to test with any formats you expect to encounter.,regex,cthy1c4,1,t5_2qr8f

Youll have to come up with different solutions each time different elements occur between the first span that you want and that div.,regex,d0ct7xz,1,t5_2qr8f

10415393,0,t3_5p5y83,Thats a good question.  If I understand it correctly you just want to remove anything inside of the  ...     KEEPTHIS   REMOVETHIS    KEEPTHISSo it would look like this    KEEPTHIS KEEPTHISIf so youre very close.  Simply escape the asterisk  with a backslash  as the asterisk has a special meaning.Here is an example of something you can use in your findreplace  spaces added for clarity  there should be no spaces in this        .?    Then I just replace whatever it matched with nothing.  All I did there was take your  and escape the asterisk by adding a backslash to it .  I did same with the closing tag turning it from this  to this .  The middle of that says to match any character . any number of times  until you hit the next part of the expression ? which is the closing .Here is a demo,regex,dconieh,3,t5_2qr8f
