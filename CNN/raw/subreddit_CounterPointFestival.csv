3119590,0,t3_2vupbp,The way I understand it those artist will be playing at that particular stage. Its probably a themed stage to match all those feels coming from that lineup. Its hard to say for sure or give you a summary as the stage layout seems to be completely different this year.,CounterPointFestival,colcf9v,2,t5_2u460

3959882,0,t3_35smro,I love what Bunk Police is doing but their test kits are some of the most overpriced on the market. Here are some other options... Option  This will test for anything seen here It will can test for a MDXX substance which means it could be MDMA MDA MDE etc. It should be noted that most of those outside of MDMA are definably rarer to find in comparison within MDXX. Option  This one provides a bit more varitey and also a way of double checking results from the other tests. It includes the test from the last one along with test for this and this Again it can only get specific enough to test for a MDXX substance. Option  This includes all of the three from the last one and also the Simons A and B test. The Simons tests will allow you to differentiate if the substance is either MDMAMDE or MDA. At this point I would say its pretty safe to say its MDMA if its not MDA. Obviously not  but MDE is not prevalent at all. Option  This one includes all three from option  along with a test for psychedelics. Sadly it pretty much only test if its a psychedelic substances from my understanding as seen here If anyone knows of a better method please let me know. Option  This is just the test for psychedelics from option .,CounterPointFestival,cr7nrl6,2,t5_2u460
4005603,0,t3_3679o5,What the others said. I have a camp stove and MAP gas but this year we are not going to go all out on food because there is too much going on during the day. Im sure Ill do breakfast tacos with sausage and egg buy the carton of de shelled egg for best results because there is nothing like food in the outdoor morning. I have a camp stove cook set with a percolator for morning caffeine.Id bring stuff for sandwiches Hot Dogs and Grilled cheese etc and trail food when possible. You only need one real good meal a day and Friday is probably the day you do want some food in the belly for the afternoon.If all works out we will be set up by or before AM and Ill have lunch ready for about  people there are two of us and always some neighbors to bond with by noon.Quick nap and then off to Flow!,CounterPointFestival,crcvb07,2,t5_2u460

4096512,0,t1_crmvst8,So you missed nearly an entire hour of the set. You dont really have room to speak on how most of their set was. I was at Umphreys until about  and then I went over to the end of Zeds Dead. The last  minutes were amazing and that was my th time seeing them.,CounterPointFestival,crn87ra,0,t5_2u460
