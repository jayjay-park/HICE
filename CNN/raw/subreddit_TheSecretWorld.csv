And with stuff like the augments or cheevos or sequin bags or filling up your skill wheels theres nothing really stopping someone from swapping in some low gear stuff and assistingeespecially for some of those great Kingsmouth quests. Example pull off some gear and grab some plain vanilla weapons from the test chamber at your Hq that may only be the name for the lumie version... Im talking about the first place you go in the game to learn how weapons work. Ive done this a few times and made it a bit more fun by trying out crappy but fun builds like tons of impairs or hinders. So yeah anyone can join up and be your quest buddy it just involves  minutes of snagging lowbie equipment from your base and using meet up. PS.

That was before WoW but is mechanically very similar.The only thing those games copy is the fantasy setting.Rifts character progression is unique and warhammers questing system was different in all the right ways.The fact is that anything in a fantasy setting with orcs dwarves and wizards is going to be called a WoW clone.Its like Apple saying any phone that is rectangular in shape and has rounded corners is copying the iPhone.,TheSecretWorld,citu417,2,t5_2s6lr
1700510,0,t3_2dus56,Ami Legend is one of those instances where you will die over and over and over unless you know the trick.The trick is to pull the bugs toward the back of the chamber far away from Ami stay there avoid her AOE damage and then just kill the Akab quickly before more spawns come.If you are otherwise doing ok in SC then you already know how to kill Akab.  They come in various sizes but all have the same unchanging bag of tricks.Either circle strafe them or just dodge their charge attack and youll be fine.  Their normal damage is trivial as long as you keep dragging them around in circles and dont get pinned down by their knockdowns.This instance is a good early example of how leveling up in this game works.  Unlike in most games leveling up in TSW is  about learning new stupid combat tricks and only  about gear and APSP investment.A player who knows the mechanics and how to deal with them will blow through a zone no matter what gear or setup theyre using even with hilariously underleveled gear you need one weapon SP line up high enough to avoid a severe hit rate penalty but thats all that is actually required.Just keep in mind that every zone and instance in the game is there to teach you a new trick or a new category of mob behaviors.

The other stuff people are linking are pretty advanced and really work best with a solid gear base.Your first issue when starting nightmares is going to be hanging on to aggro because when you start EVERYONE is going to be doing tons of damage compared to you.Therefore I recommend something like this for just getting started. That should take you through all the normal dungeons and elites no problem as well as up to UrDraug when you start NMs.One thing your going to need to make peace with is that as a tank youre in control of the fight and you need to be the FIRST one in the group to change your build to the situation if needed or even if possible to guarantee a smooth kill.For NM UrDraug Id tweak to something like this  until youre well geared.

2567207,0,t3_2p2z1m,As has been partially stated already most of the systems you have listed are actually forms of vertical progression. All the gear in the core game including glyphs amp the popular signets give vertical progression They make your numbers bigger so you can do more damage or take more damage or heal faster.The core horizontal progression in TSW is the Abilities Wheel. It creates a variety of ways in which to apply the big numbers youre getting from your gear. Structurally Solomon Island amp Egypt are reasonably balanced between vertical and horizontal progressionwhen most new players complained about the difficulty of SC andor BM their trouble wasnt because their numbers werent big enough but because they hadnt been expanding horizontally around the wheel enough adapting their builds to the situation. By the time you reach Transylvania youre in what Funcom considers endgame you dont have to get better gear to beat any normal mobs across all  regions of Transylvania you only need to adapt your build amp strategies to deal with all the different situationspure horizontal progression.After the core game the next layer of horizontal progression they added as AUX weapons they were carefully designed to not generally improve DPShealthhealing at all but to give more options about how you approached different fights. Mobility buffsdebuffs et cetera. After AUX weapons the next layer of vertical progression and JoelFuncom explicitly describe the system as vertical progression the idea that it was supposed to be horizontal progression took hold in the long period where we knew a new system was coming but didnt know anything about it was Augments. The entire ScenariosAugments system is optional content for endgame players who really like to repeat content over and over for tiny tiny improvements. How tiny? So tiny that without investing hundreds of hours youre generally better off slotting a single purple Signet than grinding out Augments Augments are grinding content for people who already spent a year or more grinding Signets.After that they added a layer of horizontal progression AEGIS. It doesnt do anything to make your numbers bigger although it has its own set of numbers which you can make bigger but only as a percentage of your preexisting vertical progression and you can still get through all the content in Tokyo with the blue amp green gear drops which could have carried you through Tokyoif you are very adaptable both in build and in tactics. Importantly both mob amp player shields are two sides of the same AEGIS system Only a percentage of damage you output hits a mobs AEGIS shield and only a percentage of the I mobs damage hits your shieldyou dont hit any harder they dont hit any harder its primarily horizontal.Im the sort of player who almost never repeats content and has no interest in NManything so I can vouch for the fact that TSW is designed to allow a player to progress from beginning to end with just gear from drops amp mission rewards without doing dungeons without grinding Scenariosblue gear plus a couple purple pieces from the Issues with blue glyphs blue glyph toolkits are pretty rare and blue amp green Signets from drops no Augments and just the set of AEGIS gear you get by going through the missions with the recent corrections to be sure players get capacitorscontrollers all v. or v. a new player going through the missions once buying upgrades with just that one set of sequins at the new rates can either get a full set of controllers to . or one controller up to . I believe is sufficient to complete all the nonNM content in the game. To clarify Just do all the missions amp slot your drops amp rewards and youll be fine. No need to minmax no need to even think about Augments no need to grind out AEGIS levels. If they maintain this philosophy throughout future development there is no reason to expect the game to grow unwieldy in complexity Casual players should be able to just run through do each mission once slot random drops amp mission rewards and do just finethe extra depth is there for people who want it.So it isnt quite as broad as you make it out Core game Horizontal Abilitiesbuilds  Core game Vertical Gear talismans weapons glyphs signets amp skills First addition Horizontal AUX weapons several added over  months Second addition Vertical Augments added another  months later Third addition Horizontal AEGIS added another year later over several monthsAs another commenter noted theres plenty of room for AEGIS to be expanded via new colors color combinations and further verticalwithinthehorizontal progressionI suspect that fullyupgraded purple AEGIS controllers will trend toward  damage throughput theres room on the AUX wheel for a few more weapons and something a lot of us have been expectingaskingfor since Beta is the eventual addition of a third tier of abilities on the wheel andor entirely new abilitytreesweapons expanding the wheelall of that couldshould be horizontal progression without increasing the complexity or manageability of the systems.Another important consideration is that from a gameplay standpoint adding more things to think about out of combat is much much more manageable than adding more layers of things to think about during combat. So adding new AUX weapons expanding the wheel giving another extra wheel Augments et cetera are all things which though complex do not make a big difference in how momenttomoment combat is experienced.tldr Only  actual new systems since launch Augments are  optional and the other  together are an order of magnitude less complex than the Ability Wheel. Plus Except for bossesNM content which should be nighunmanageably challenging its all outofcombat systems not combat systems.,TheSecretWorld,cmto7iv,6,t5_2s6lr

3416613,0,t3_2zcjhi,I think other people have mostly answered your questions but Ill expand on that a little bit.TSW makes its money by selling DLC called Issues. This is primarily storyline content that adds additional missions to the game. Each issue is roughly  and they are all well worth the price tag. The base game comes with a couple hundred hours of content for  and after that youll need to buy issues in order to get additional content.The difference between this and most other MMOs is that you get the full game experience for the content you have purchased. That is they do not ask you to pay for anything other than content. There are no features locked behind the optional subscription fee for the game. They do not ever press you into purchasing anything from the cash shop. Progression isnt ever designed around pushing people to buy boosts with real money.I really like this model personally. They make content they offer it to me for purchase and they dont try to nickel and dime me to death in between. I know exactly what Im getting for my money and I know that Ill always be able to enjoy it regardless of how much money I feel like giving them in the future.

It added six missions to the game spread over all three zones.You seem to be asking how much long the game is. Well that depends really on how smart and curious and how much of a completionist you are.It can be everything from a few hours of just doing the main story quest and zerging through everything to as long as you want it to be.Difficulty does ramp up somewhat so you might find yourself slowed down.Egypt is very legwork heavy so that will slow you down a bit and I find many of the investigation quests are much harder in egypt and transylvania than they were on solomon island.Youll hit a wall and might wanna get issues when youve cleared out every story main and side quest dungeon raid and lair exhausted all dialogue options with every single npc seen every cutscene collected all lore fragments killed all rare mobs and obtained all achievements in all faction hubs plus all of solomon island egypt and transylvania.Most people opt for going for more questing content before they do all those things though obviously.

The exception is that you want to glyph your chaos focus with hit rating for impairs.In elites heal tanking is basically healing with agitator. In nms you have to perform the duties of a regular tank too so that means youll want to expose and afflict. Usually this means bloodsport and intensify  discord rising. Also you will need to impairs chaotic pull  one other and the whip impair. This is why you want hit on your chaos focus. Keeping agro is fairly simple start the fight with fired up or cb immediately.

6389381,0,t3_42sbkj,Wanted to chime in with a tip.  There are a set of several sidequests in the southern Kaidan area that are relatively easy and award bio containers.Near Jake Hama there are two very quick ones.  One is to collect supplies and take them to the diner.  The other is to inspect a body and then defeat a filth beast.  These can be knocked out in under  minutes.  South towards the residential area theres a quest to kill enemies of each aegis type and a quest to locate some orochi personnel.  The kill quest is pretty easy even at low AEGIS levels but takes a bit of time.  The Orochi personnel quest is a bit more difficult and takes a fair amount of time.Even further south towards the coast theres a mission to kill some demons.  Takes about a minute and isnt terribly difficult if you can avoid their aoe.To the west end of the residential area theres another side mission to track down some radio beacons.  Id advise skipping this one its a little time consuming until you learn the exact spawn locations and it has you run all over the damn place.To the west by the railroad there are  quests that are each relatively simple.  Theres one to locate three caches.  This is very easy just port between the various anima wells to grab them or grab them when completing other missions.  Theres another to kill the new orochi drones.  Should be manageable and its reasonably quick.  Theres yet another to track down the source of destroyed drones.  Also pretty easy and quick.Further to the west theres a side quest for hitting filth birds with a tracking rifle.  Easy but can be obnoxiously time consuming depending on luck.  Try the school yard area with Jung they frequently fly there.By the docks theres another side quest killing several fungal enemies.  Also pretty easy and quick but be careful about pulling off more than you can deal with.Between the easy ones thats  biohazard containers along with  black bullion and the potential for several shipping container keys that could be even more BB.  Takes about  minutes to an hour depending on your AEGIS level and gear.

7690865,0,t3_4k8kth,Well Id say its great that you have the entire inner wheel filled out it gives you a wealth of options to experiment with. Savage Coast tends to have a pretty big ramp up in difficulty from the first zone. I had to experiment a lot to find stuff that worked for me.Ive been having a lot of fun with elementalismblood since Savage Coast. It served me really well until Transylvania and then I needed to make some changes with the build to focus a little more on self heals.As some folks here have said using abilities that compliment one another is key as is making sure to synergize those passives.For instance my eleblood build focuses on chains and afflictions and relies almost entirely on the passives to make it work setting up chains to afflict as well as having chains create a healing barrier then having a passive that makes one of my stronger skills guarantee a crit if the target is afflicted. I have two selfhealing skills on my hotbar for tight situations. The result is a setup that has made me hard to kill while still doing a nice chunk of damage. My singletarget numbers arent as massive as they were before I focused more on chains and selfheals but Im having MUCH more fun than I was before and Im not hitting walls as much as I was either.Just an example of a way to make passives work for you and a way to have two different weapons work together like a welloiled machine.Take some time to try out a few different things. Sometimes you just gotta sit in a safe area read tooltips and tweak a whole crapload of builds. It can be a grind but it will help make the game less frustrating in the long run Good luck!!,TheSecretWorld,d3gehcn,2,t5_2s6lr
7727153,0,t1_d3ki14z,Yeah Id axe forking paths for solo questing and just roll bamboo cutter  there are a lot of frenzybased procs that go well with it and its good to herd those zombies cultists vampires. Probably anima shot too unless youre just set on it and pick up martial discipline and its passive for healing there are some good heal passives with bamboo cutter too Elite is fine. CtP is amazing. My line of reasoning here is youre left with one additional space that could go to a builder  isnt necessarily a bad thing especially for solo play where you need to be able to handle all your own debuffs or a consumer if you want to ramp up your damage a bit. Youve got pulls so you wouldnt necessarily have to wade into a pack of mobs to CtPBamboo cutter to start the fight. Its not so much that leech is bad for solo questing  its just an issue of opportunity costs. It works a lot better as a dedicated healing build where you can devote the passives to it that it needs without shortchanging something else.,TheSecretWorld,d3kiu7a,2,t5_2s6lr
7777936,0,t1_d3q9kq0,Theres even purgecleanse passives that are reliable enough for the GK fight.

The problem only arises if they are of different qualities because the buff is based on your strongest weapons this is a concern because aux weapons cannot be upgraded beyond . so they typically suffer a bit from upgrading your regular weapons.Unless uurdad cares enough to make a set of  weapon power weapons exclusively for PvP this doesnt matter.

11032234,0,t1_deidwx0,Thats not what Im saying the ability wheel system is fine but the COMBAT itself the part when those skills are supposed to come together is the part thats overly clunky. TSW came out with its traditional oldschool tab targeting at the moment when every other new MMO jumped to more dynamic action based combat where dodging incoming attacks actually means something since it gives you invulnerability frames instead of just moving you quarter of an inch further than simply walking away or where projectiles and spells actually travel through the air. Then theres the issue of every single build you can make play out the exact same way pull off  builders then  consumer rinse and repeat ad infinitum regardless of what youre wielding. Then theres also the reticule system that got halfassedly added in a year or two later a system in which you still have to manually keep pressing  to shoot instead of letting you bind basic attacks to mouse buttons. The combat also suffers from very repetitive sound effects and animations being constantly repeated together with spell effects that are hard to discern from one another especially in pvp where it all becomes too much to bear. The idea of  skills and the way you unlock them is fine but while the story and atmosphere are awesome the execution of engagement was on par if not even worse than most free to play MMOs while also demanding buying the account paying a subscription AND having an expensive cash shop go along with that. What they offered simply wasnt up to standards and were not even gonna go into engine optimization here since thats a whole nother sack of beans.Sure the asking price has changed now for the most part but then it seemed like TSW wanted to be a triple A title but instead it ended up being one that offered a not so satisfying way of dealing with the terrors of the night that lacked any kind of punch a system where enemies fall to the ground as soon as your consumer starts its casting bar instead of them dying when it successfully finishes. They should have stepped up their game a long time ago but instead they took a step back to reconsider the asking price and settled on being a cheapish niche title by removing the monthly fees. Take out the investigation missions and TSW plays out like a  year old game akin to what Guild Wars did all the way back in . Im not saying mandatory monthly fees need to come back its too late for that now but at the very least they can make killing baddies be a more tolerable experience.,TheSecretWorld,deih8ne,2,t5_2s6lr

They had the reticule system in the original game but it feels more improved and weapon mechanics are nice although they do need less RNG.,TheSecretWorld,dgfuij8,4,t5_2s6lr

Because they knew the game was going to bomb.So yeah Im not supremely confident that theyd be honest with us just because one guy resigned. Companies have cultures and the crooks tend to be surrounded by other crooks.Though at least this time with it being FP the worst anyone can lose is some download quota.,TheSecretWorld,dgq6syr,2,t5_2s6lr
