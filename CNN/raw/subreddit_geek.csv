The same holds true of the US Diplomatic Corps.I do not have to believe both.  Youve provided very little logic to explain WHY one would have to believe both.

Theres no middle ground on that.Youre missing the FAR broader point which is referenced numerous times in the article I provided you.  Yes you CAN construct explanations for specific bits of how Carl MIGHT have been civilian.  You might even say the text interpreted in that context supports the possibility that Carl was civilian.  But it does not NECESSITATE he was civilian and leaves open the possibility he was military.Then you have MOST OF THE REST OF THE BOOK which makes it FAR MORE CLEAR that theres no nonmilitary service.

There are . billion base pairs in a single copy of the genome normal diploid cells ie. most of the cells in your body have two copies so they will have twice that many base pairs though most will be the same between the two copies.  A normal haploid sperm cell with a single copy of the genome will still have . billion base pairs.You could probably get higher compression of DNA sequences using some sort of compression unique to DNA sequences.  For example base encoding where each possible combination of  DNA letters is reduced to one value eg. AT   TA   GC   etc. but I dont think the OPs picture has that kind of thing in mind.

Freedom of speech doesnt just selectively work. All those SJWs just want to hear what makes them happy but whether they want to hear it or not shitty things are still happening and bullying someone for making a joke isnt helping.

Essentially they have a cooling plate at the bottom of a container for the bottle usually some kind of cozy with a wire mesh or something to distribute the cold to the bottom of the bottle anyways the cold side of a Peltier cooler  Thermoelectric plate  would make contact with the bottom of the bottle and a heatsink would be on the hot underside.  Add a small fan and a battery pack to power the whole apparatus fan and Peltier cooler and youve got yourself a handheld beer cooler.Peltier coolers never became a thing because it takes more power to run a thermoelectric cooler than it does to run a compressorcooled system so very few systems use a thermalelectric device to create a cooling effect only when size is more important than efficiency are they ever really used.  the fridgecoolers and microfridges come to mind the ones that are just big enough for a sixpackTheyre also used in technology for extreme liquid cooling  many people have used them to get their CPU down below  degrees C and used a liquid cooling system on the hot side of the plate to handle the output heat.Its quite a fascinating technology I just wish someone would improve the efficiency a little.,geek,cq8zerw,3,t5_2qh17

Theres a whole bunch of things and undoubtedly two of them will correlate between people due to randomness. Like e.g. perhaps people who wrote monkey correlate with reasonablygood skiers. That correlation is probably going to be high because a monkey is a really common animal to think of and a lot of people ski. If you make a Venn diagram of people who are relativelygood at skiing and people who wrote monkey its probable theres a large overlap and therefore a high correlation coefficient between the variables of an answer of monkey and an answer of relativelygood at skiing. I think looking at the uncommon stuff and seeing if theres some kind of hiddencorrelation that is not really otherwise explainable would be pretty interesting. But since all the people who read xkcd already share at least one thing in common xkcd which itself has a variety of particular attributes sense of humor art style and themes of math science etc. theres probably a baseline correlation between any two people that read xkcd in that the actions of one xkcd reader could be possibly predictive of the behavior of another xkcd reader. In fact it has to be by definition. xkcd is on the internet so if you have two xkcd readers and know a lot about the behavior of one and none of the behavior of the other then you can predict that the second person almost surely reads at least one internet comic. ,geek,cuoexrd,5,t5_2qh17

Fox or Christopher Lloyd on set.EDIT As stated elsewhere this was filmed at the Puente Hills mall. On the other side of the  freeway was a vacant former Ikea building where they filmed parts of Mr. amp Mrs. Smith. Down the street at the end of Stoner Creek was... oh at the time I think it was called Roadrunner Speedway. Quite a few movies filmed gocart racing scenes there.

I wondered if maybe there was supposed to be more to the message so I visited your site and turns out you arent a crazy person. I read your What Taxpayers dont know about Voter Guides and I didnt know any of that information about costs. Eye opening for sure.gt And the novelty of the binary did motivate me to visit your site so  well spent.gt gt Reading your story has interested me. What stances do you take? I cant find much other than the evoting platform which is an interesting idea.gt gt Specifically where do you stand ongt womens rightsgt LGBTQ rightsgt Gun rightsgt Social safety netsgt public services fundinggt schoolsgt gt Id like to vote for you because I like what Ive seen so far. Id just like a bit more information.gt gt Thanks!Responsegt Thanks for the feedback. Did you see the video at evoteAmerica.org?gt gt If you havent please start with that and let me know if you have any more questions.gt gt If you have seen the video let me know and Ill get back to you asap.my replygt Just watched the video this morning and it raised a few more questions.gt gt So I understand your policies would be the will of the people and a true will of the people not gerrymandered districts however the ideal solution youve proposed with the evote platform wont be able to go into effect overnight right?gt gt Before it takes traction you are going to have to vote on bills that come before you and you wont have the evote results to decide which way to vote. gt gt I have several questions about the evote platform as wellgt gt Crowdfunding  gt You mentioned the platform would be crowdfunded. Would it be through a kickstarter like company or would it be crowdfunded through taxes? gt gt How much money do you think you would have to raise in order to put this system in place?gt gt Technology  gt You mentioned how we can easily vote from our many internet enabled devices. What about the  of Americans with no internet connection? Would  million voters primarily old poor or minority Americans no longer have a vote? Requiring an internet connection means either you need to pay to vote a modern day poll tax or you would need to require a federally free internet service used for voting.gt gt You mentioned that  years from now people can go back and audit any vote at any time. Where will the archives physically be hosted? Who will build that datacenter? Who will care for that datacenter? You mentioned that it would not be owned by any companies or the government so who would that position report to?gt gt Would the platform be an app or a website? Or would it be a combination of apps a website and a text to vote system?gt gt Security  gt You mentioned that users would be authenticated to their accounts and hacking into one would be a breach of  U.S.C.   and fraudulent voting would be covered under  U.S.C.   but what happens when someones account is compromised. Who do they contact to get their account back? gt gt What if there were votes cast while compromised and the issue is already complete? gt gt What if a cybercrime organization compromised a significant userbase and DDoSed the evote platform after they voted their way? gt gt What if the digital archives were rewritten by an AnCap hacker?gt gt How will you detect if someone sells their vote?gt gt How will you detect if someone buys a bunch of votes?gt gt Will you be able to verify someones status before they cast a vote? For example do the dead get automatically purged from your system or is it up to the family of the deceased to deregister them?gt gt What about elder abuse? Are there steps in place to prevent people from signing up the elderly users and  million other voters I mentioned before and selling their votes to interested parties?gt gt What sort of DNS is the platform going to use? Is it going to rely on the users DNS or the ISP? If the user or ISP DNS wont there be room for fraud? A MitM attack could hijack the outgoing votes say from a college campus reroute them through a server that switches all of the yes to no or no to yes or however the attacker wishes to vote. Or if it is a website they could MitM to a phishing website and the use the compromised credentials to vote however they please. gt gt So I like the idea of the platform I just have lots of questions about the execution of it. I think it would be a great step in the right direction it just needs to be done correctly. gt gt If youd like to get back to me on any of these thatd be great. If not I totally understand. Thank you for your time either way!His responsegt Due to time constraints Ill give you the highlevel overview. If we have an Evoting Candidate looking like they may win an election Financing and Leadership will be lined up prior to election night so we can hit the ground running.gt gt Financing The financing is as much a security issue as the tech. Startup costs will be crowdfunded but there is a detailed plan to ensure the Evoting Service pays for itself after only one round of crowdfunding.gt gt Leadership The Administrations Officer will be entrusted with TechnologySecurityPersonnel decisions. The first AO will have  significant social media corporation experience and  a history of taking actions indicating a sense of public service. I have a few people in mind all in the SF Bay Area.gt gt If a bill comes before the first Evoting Congressman before the Evoting Service is operational what do you think that Evoting Congressman should do? Im very interested in your option analysis for that problem if you have time. I dont like the options in that situation but maybe you have a clever optionsolution.My final responsegtIm not sure what an Evoting Congressman should do if the service isnt operational. Currently they would vote in what they assume is their best interest be it the will of the companies who pay them or the constituents if they truly care about the people that put them in office. Unfortunately I dont have any better solutions or options but Ill keep trying to think of one.gtgtI like your ideas and Im going to keep watching to see how they turn out. Thanks for taking the time out of your day to correspond with me I appreciate it.his final responsegtRe the Evoting Service Im seeing two potential dead zonesgt  The period between getting an Evoting Congressman elected and getting the Evoting Service launched andgt  The periods when the servicenetwork fails nuclear war EMP hacking etc..gt Im still trying to pin down recommended protocols for dead zones. New system new problems to solve.gt gt Im putting everything Ive come up with so far into an ebook too.

Once I realized this was base the zero came to me. That being said Im a computer programmer with many math classes and number systems under my belt. This may not be so obvious to most let alone a budding civilization.Also I believe your example of the number  in the legend is incorrect... shouldnt the second symbol be what looks like a  to us but is  in this system? What you have there is  dots a  in the alien system and a  in binary.Edit scratch the critique about the  example. Its late Im on NyQuil and I couldnt wrap my head around the base for a few minutes. One more thing though! In Section  you describe three angles. I may be missing the point but Im assuming those are   and .

10477687,0,t1_dcvg1a5,...I wasnt going to bother because I feel like I have this argument every time net neutrality is mentioned and its really rather tiresome. Even though its so important people dont know what theyre fighting for and dilute the message by confusing it with other issues that are dear to them such as traffic limits which have always existed on the commercial internet. But let me try to change your mind First heres the wikipedia article on net neutrality Its a fairly good lengthy and well sourced article where you can read the original definition of net neutrality and associated issues. You can glean from here how it is a networking matter quality of service traffic discrimination. Read the engineer testimonials and how companies and organizations fought for net neutrality.There is a single mention of traffic caps in the article which in my opinion shouldnt even be there but lets look at it. Its in . Favoring private networks. Favoring private networks is a genuine issue which is being confused with traffic limits. It has a single source an article in a nontechnological publication Fortune with a misleading title Is Comcast violating netneutrality rules? The author doesnt answer the question but implies that some people thought they were. Who? We are directed to The Verge and Techcrunch. If you read the linked articles youll see that in both cases traffic caps are mentioned in relation to the much more serious violation of bandwidth discrimination by creating a parallel high speed network which is its own issue.Also linked in the wikipedia article as a source is an old testimony by Vint Cerf Vint Cerf codesigned the Internet Protocol and is one of the founding fathers of the internet. This is an interesting testimony I recommend reading it in full in this case I mention it because it touches upon the subject of parallell private networksgt Some  carriers  are  also  seeking  permission  to  create  two  separate  IP  networks  one  for  the  gt public Internet and one for a privatelymanaged proprietary service.  Allowing segmentation  gt of  the  broadband  networks  into  capacious  broadestband  toll  lanes  for  some  and  narrow  gt dirt access roads for the rest is contrary to the design and spirit behind the Internet as well as  gt our national competitive interests.  And by definition favoring some disfavors others.  In an  gt environment where  consumers  already  have  little  to  no  choice  of  broadband  providers  the  gt end  result  is a cramped version of  the  robust and open environment we all  take  for granted  gt today.  Prioritization inevitably becomes a zerosum game. As you can see he clearly describes the issue as a problem of network management and discrimination. There is no mention of traffic caps.Do you have a good source showing that traditionally traffic caps are a violation of net neutrality? Im open to being convinced too.,geek,dcvr604,2,t5_2qh17

He was a teenager during the Holocaust so he was likely born in the s. Alpha the Ultimate Mutant a being that was geneticallycreated by Magneto rebelled against him and reverted the entire Brotherhood to infancy.gtMoira MacTaggert experimented on the infant Magneto in hopes of finding a way to help her mutant son Proteus but failed. Erik the Red used his advanced Shiar technology to revert Magneto back into an adult. However as a means of gaining Magnetos trust and respect he reverted him to his physical prime rather than his natural age.This is why Magneto is portrayed as being a very muscular man for his age. His official weight is  lbs. ,geek,dehkj97,1,t5_2qh17
