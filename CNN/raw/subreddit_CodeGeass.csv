1038174,0,t3_25zb81,For one simple reason its ambiguous enough to allow audience members to argue for it. Primary pieces of evidence that I and many others use include The ambiguity of Code transfer and whether or not Charles pasted his own to Lelouch the flashback Nunnually sees which is only a power Code bearers have demonstrated see CC with Suzaku giving him shock memory and because of CCs last remarks in the epilogue power of kings makes one lonely not quite the case looks up towards the front of cart right Lelouch? instant cut to craneRight then lets dig in shall we?As far as the audience knows one goes through  phases with the superpower of the show A Geass Bearer and a Code Bearer. However there IS an inbetween. Lemme elaborate.Look at CC becoming a Code Bearer. How did it happen? She was alive and happy as a Geass bearer making everyone love her. Then after her Geass fully activated two eyes marked the Nun transfers the Code making herself mortal and gives CC a mortal wound which hasnt healed even though shes immortal now. What if CC wasnt given that wound? She would be a Geass bearer with a dormant Code inside here that doesnt activate until she dies. See how we can apply this to Lelouch?Lets skip the Nunnually bit and go to CC first. Pretty self explanatory tbh. The supposed footage of the driver smiling is fake watermark disappears for one thing but seriously. CC would be one to talk to herself or to pretend to talk to spirits I guess but why then does she look in a specific direction when she says right lelouch? Also the way she pauses right before saying Lelouch and then the drawn out name really demonstrates her relationship with him see English dub pretty sure same in Jap dub as well just not as obvious. Theres also WHAT she says about how the power of a king isolates one and about how that ended up not being applicable to him.Then theres the biggie Nunnuallys vision at the end. She touches his hand is shocked and then we see flashbacks of pretty much EVERY SCENE that contributed to lelouch coming to this very point. Recall how Suzaku got memory shock from CC when she intentionally brought out HIS own painful memories. Granted its differentbut it reveals that Code Bearers do have some memory control makes since considering what world of C and what god was. So wouldnt it be possible for Lelouch as a Code Bearer to be reflecting on these thoughts and Nunnually gets to see them too?Reason I left that for last is because the creators supposedly put out a statement saying that Nunnually was able to see this because of her ability to read emotions by touch and that Lelouch is dead. And I have one response to that Bull fucking shit.If the intended ending was that Lelouch dies they did a sorry ass job making it clear to the audience. They should not have to come out and explicitly state the ending. Its like the EVA creator getting mad at people looking too deep into the characters of Evangelion. His response was basically theyre a bunch of immature kids with fucked up lives and youre reading too much into this which is absolutely ludicrous. Its your responsibility as the creator to convey what youre trying to convey and if you have to release a  statement later own EXPLAINING your own work youve failed. The work is already in the hands of the audience and I have every right to interpret it as I see fit within reason and canon and valid extrapolations of characters and plotlines.Theyre just trying to get beyond Lelouch at this point which is damn near hard to do considering he was what a lot of people lovedhated and the ending sure as hell doesnt make it easier. Well explanationrant now over. Welcome to Code Geass. Watch it once and spend the rest of your time in the anime side of the internet either trying to convince people hes dead or that hes alive. Or just let everyone come to their own conclusions as long as their evidence is valid and not just I LUV LELOUCH or some false info like the fake video and take part in a healthy discussion. tldr. I will forever wave Lelouchs banner. And only under his orders will I put it down and surrender to the naysayers. Of course Ill make sure to keep the fact that hes alive to myself and not share it with the unworthy. ALL HAIL LELOUCH!,CodeGeass,chman0i,9,t5_2tjxg

1453796,0,t1_ciyc6ld,Im honestly sick of arguing with you over a point that youre so fervently pushing so  theres nothing wrong with your argument. Yes Lelouch is a Christ Figure obviously since theres no counterargument to that. Sure Lelouch has a literary connection to Jesus and his death was all about selfsacrifice  I dont believe I ever disputed that. Lelouch never killed Charles himself but he indirectly caused it. I hate to play devils advocate but where in the laws of Code does it say that you have to directly kill someone in order to receive Code? Correlation in the ways that the characters received their Code does not imply that there are no other ways to receive Code. I do not spit on Lelouchs selfsacrifice. Im merely appreciating the possibilities of alternate endings just like all of the other fans who make fanstories and discuss those endings. Thematically everything youre saying is correct. However that doesnt mean I cannot enjoy the show through my own lens  one where I say screw Lelouchs selfsacrifice because Id never do something like that and imagine that it ends somewhere else. Youre so closed minded to another possibility and I understand that. Thats fine. Even though the selfsacrifice is there I dont like that ending even though I appreciate the authors choice. There are plenty of death scenes that are impactful where the character doesnt die even though they appear to. No Game No Life has one. SteinsGate. Hell Id even go so far as to say Madoka Magica. Although none of these have the Christ Figure connection that youre obviously making they have death scenes where the character only appears to die. Sure Lelouchs selfsacrifice is undeniable  but his living to continue existence is a hope that us as fans can have. Ill point out the most obvious example  in Gurren Lagann Simon could have quite obviously sacrificed himself in the last scene in order to save humanity. However the makers of the show choose to let him live in order to see the world that he saved  one where all of the Spiral Races could live in harmony. Perhaps its because I finished Gurren Lagann before I watched Code Geass but I much prefer an ending such as this one  where the hero lives in order to see the world that he creates.Oh and while Im at it Gurren Lagann has the similar selfsacrifice that youre pointing out here but since you havent seen it I wont bother with analyzing it.,CodeGeass,ciyibf7,1,t5_2tjxg

9650549,0,t3_5cvk5d,Ive read most of the theories but I havent read something about Geass losing its power after the person who owns it dies. I mean in episode  you recall that Lelouch wanted to destroy the Geass order and they did. As Zero he commanded that everyone should be killed including children. One of his soldiers encountered an unnamed child from the orderRolos brothers. One of the children had a similar Geass as Lelouch. The child waved his hand and ordered the soldier to attack his comrades. Then Rolo came and killed those children. The effect of Geass on the soldier was nulled. Then in Season  episode  where Lelouch and Suzaku were talking about his death Lelouch said that Schneizel would also serve Zero. The question is Being Schneizel who wanted to control the world well this is what Ive seen about his true intentions why would he follow Zero? You would say of course Lelouch used his geass on him. The effect of geass should disappear when the person who used them dies Season  episode . Shouldnt the power of Geass be out of Schneizels system already? And what of Nunally? Didnt her eyes opened because Charles was dead? If Nunally can resist Charless geass why didnt she do it before? And why cant she resist Lelouchs geass? I mean if Lelouch is dead Schneizel shouldnt be following what he was commanded to do. Thats one of the questions Ive been asking and if Im wrong about these observations please enlighten me. ,CodeGeass,da2moyn,2,t5_2tjxg

Though the episode is not entirely clear about location and the travel path.And while Kallen isnt concerned about civilians all that much I still think theres a distinction between not caring and randomly murdering people for no good reason.

His response was Fools. You finally figured it out. That Ive been using you all. Thats right. Youre all just pawns in my game. He never mentioned Geass never admitted to anything involving Euphemia.

10009156,0,t1_dbc5ts8,gtYes Lelouch ended up killing a lot of people be it by accident or on purpose in R. but his entire principal was to make the entire world hate him and by doing so create an icon of anti tyranny that would lead the world in peace for at least a generation probably more.This is only his goal NEAR THE END. Zero Requiem wasnt always a thing. However the rest of their lives certainly had great similarities. And even with the Zero Requiem taken into account there are still great similarities. I mean Hitlers actions DID manage to get an unanimous never again out of the world just like Lelouch. If we look at Code Geass as an alternative spin on World War  which portrays Hitler as a noble savior who sacrificed himself to create a better world then it actually makes sense.   After all if you were a civilian in the Code Geass world you would never have known about Zero Requiem. To the everyman in Code Geass Lelouch IS Hitler. We only know about Lelouchs noble sacrifices because we are the audience and see deep into his life which we cant do for Hitler. If you frame Code Geasss ending as an effort to repaint Hitler in the light of a misunderstood saint whose true motivations will never be known to us then suddenly it all comes together.At this point you might be like...why would Code Geasss authors want to portray Hitler as a noble savior of the world?Well...just gonna leave this here...This is particularly relevant to Code Geass because the NHK is their national broadcasting service. This proves that there are extremely major players in their TV industry who feel that the Axis were the good guys of WWII. With this context in mind things suddenly make sense dont they?,CodeGeass,dbc7zsu,2,t5_2tjxg

10731825,0,t3_5tj4rs,I bet the biggest enemy happens to be the one thats ruining Lelouchs plan of having peace after dyingWhoever it might be its probably someone with a Geass thats fucking shit up because they love chaos. Now people are unhappy and there are now insurrections or whatever. Might be because someone gives proof that Lelouch had a Geass and maybe people think they were under that Geass and are now living a life of fake peace. Might be because people realize that they arent being represented somehow. Maybe people dont want to be a part of Britannia no matter how good they have it.,CodeGeass,ddmwohu,2,t5_2tjxg
10733141,0,t1_ddmq6xc,actually I was thinking of more like charles always had a backup plan if he failed and that some one is planning to destroy the world.....,CodeGeass,ddn1kbg,1,t5_2tjxg
10765626,0,t3_5tzsrs,Really cool idea that would make CG more realistic. One problem that I might see with it is characters who switch between the two languages. An example of this would be Lelouch using English as a student and Japanese as Zero. The two voice actors obviously dont have the same voice so it would sound off.,CodeGeass,ddqe7mb,8,t5_2tjxg

11530422,0,t1_dg2vysu,What? As soon as something unplanned happened in battle everything fell apart. He had no backup plans whatsoever which is pretty horrific. That is not the sign of a good tactician. Strategy is more than just fighting its economics and politics aswell. Something that Schenziel understood when he gave Euphie the go ahead for the SAZsince Charles is like LOL mundane with his plan for Chinawinning without violence and trolling Lelouch with the betraylturning his own guys against him.Lelouch is incredibly intelligentin relation to the people in the show and exceptional at reading people no doubt about it but compared to people from other shows he a two trick pony. Hur hur hur mah trapzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Mah Mund Cuntrul Pawaz.C.C. said it herself when he whined like a bitch about unequal conditions set them up beforehand and if he had an unsurpassed intellect he would you know have done so without having to be told. Fuck me he had seven years to get his act together from when he vowed to Obliterate Britannia put in some groundwork at the very least dont just moon over your little sister.,CodeGeass,dg2z4h5,-8,t5_2tjxg
