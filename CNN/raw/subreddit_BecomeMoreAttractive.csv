10719725,0,t3_5qpwlg,I really enjoyed The Charisma Myth by Olivia Fox Cabane.If books arent your thing The Mating Grounds Podcast covers most of the material in Mate and then some.  Its hosted by the authors of Mate.The Art of Charm is another podcast I love.For Youtube Videos I like the channel Charisma on Command.
