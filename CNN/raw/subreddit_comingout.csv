4192829,0,t3_38q9i3,When it comes to friends we get back what we put in. Friendship is a twoway relationship which you obviously understand. Never stop seeking out people to have intimate friendships with and your life will be rich and fulfilling. As for coming out to your parents it is hard and it is often awkward. Do it when youre ready and if youre very confident they will support you. You can also drop hints now and they to gauge their support. Good luck to you.,comingout,cry6j1y,1,t5_2rw9q
5096805,0,t1_cuxnvt4,Coming out during the eighties during the AIDS epidemic must have been well I cant image how tough that would have been. Im glad that your parents are cool with it now.I dont see my uncle much as he and my dad arent very close. Eh they have moved on from speaking in hushed tones about his partner who hes still with now. But I still feel tense when he comes up in conversation and hope that the topic will change quickly. Although that may just be because of me not wanting the gay thing to come up.Its funny you should say that you are a masculineacting gay man as I was always quite feminineacting growing up. My parents are the type of people who could have found gay porn on my laptop and still dreamed up some explanation for it being there and acted like nothing had happened. These days Im more masculineacting than Ive ever been. I used to think that I was born with a different brain to most guys or something but now I think its all to do with who you identify with. Nowadays people often tell me they had no idea that I was gay! Anyway I digress.Thanks for mentioning the coming out videos on YouTube. That was a great thing to suggest and Ive been viewing them onandoff all day. As for a plan well I dont know. I was thinking of mentioning in at the dinner table. No one did that on YouTube. Do you think its a bad idea? Cant think why it would be particularly its just that Ive never heard of anyone doing it that way.,comingout,cv0ct2r,1,t5_2rw9q
5939006,0,t1_cxxzp82,I can see your point about dating. At some point anybody I date will want to meet my parents. Im not sure if it will be sufficient to sit him down and tell him that my parents are not supportive of the gay community and it would hurt the relationship between my parents and I. That I dont want to lose them or risk it but that doesnt change how I feel about that individual. Maybe that will suffice maybe not but it could be a starting point for discussion and progression from there. Who knows? I can see where that could be an issue in the future but Ive also never felt the desire to say Hey things are going great but I know what will make it better. Two older Catholic people who hate each other. These guys sired me and now I want to throw you into that wolf pit. Have fun!All joking aside. I feel like you are using the if they are good people why would they do a bad thing argument. I am a firm believer that all dichotomies are false dichotomies. Good people do bad things and make bad choices for the right and wrong reasons and vise versa. It is not as simple as theyre good and theyre bad. Just because a person would end a relationship with me because I am gay does not mean I would reassessed my opinion about how good they truly were and does not mean that they are bad people. Theres the Good and Bad Dichotomy The thing is it is an opinion both about good and bad and about gay individuals. We cant force a person to support us. There are lots of people out there who make bold choices based on their opinions come what may. I have a friend who is a die hard vegan. She goes a little mental when somebody suggests going to a steak house and starts this never ending one sided conversation about animal rights. I still like her but I avoid saying anything about meat when Im near her because I dont want to start that conversation again. She and I have a difference of opinion but I keep it to myself because besides that quirk she is fun and interesting. Should I throw that away? Meat is also a big part of my life. I eat it every day. There is no way either of us are changing our stance about this issue so I say lets shove it under the rug for now. Maybe someday it will come up again but for now lets move on. Do you see what I mean? I have a question for you. You said As was with my own parents they do not accept homosexuality. Im living a sinful lifestyle. But we still have pretty much the same relationship because theyve chosen to work around it by just not bringing it up or bringing it up tactfully when they have. Are there any awkward family picnics? Any and when will we get grand...never mind. Any moments when you feel the relationship has changed but cant put your finger on it. Something must have changed. Did they? Did you? I like to say relationships are ever growing whether together or apart they will grow. My mom used to say that to me. I feel that you have to have a positive negative or neutral impact. Something must have happened. See thats what Im afraid of. Not yelling at my parents or being shunned but slowly drifting apart. The relationship changing too much too quickly. Dad and I go bowling less and less. Mom and I stop going to the movies. They wont ignore me but slowly push me out of their lives because of it. I see a lot of videos of fights and screaming between parent and child and conversely about love and acceptance and the bond growing stronger but I never hear about the middle ground. What if in ten years when Im  we no longer talk? No big estrangement just radio silence. Like a record player that has run out of vinyl. That seems like the worst possible outcome.You said that youve never introduced a boy to your parents. Why? Was the relationship not good enough? Not the right time? Im curious because that would be the next step after coming out. Why the delay? I know if I came out and then wanted my parents to meet a boy I was dating I would be worried that it would go terribly.,comingout,cxy4u2q,1,t5_2rw9q
6101618,0,t3_3y9de7,I feel exactly the same way as you do. Its really fucking scary. Sometimes I wish I hadnt taken the acid or smoked weed ever because then maybe this wouldnt have happened to me. I doubt it though. I think no matter what this would have come up at some point in my life and I would be willing to bet the same goes for you. I dont really have any advice because Im in the same situation. I think Im bi and I havent told anyone. Mostly just trying to say that youre not alone and that if you ever need to talk to anyone about it you can PM me or whatever.I just made a super rambling post about it like  minutes ago so you can check that out too if you wantBest of luck in figuring this out.,comingout,cyj6x77,2,t5_2rw9q

9240653,1,t1_d8n81rd,No I didnt mean that at all. I never meant for it to come off that way I was just providing a full background of my experiences.Its not that I tell myself Im not.

9780592,0,t3_5f4voc,Im in the same position as you the last of the family linea genetic culdesac. I dont put too much importance on it. Enough of my genes are shared by others out there... I mean in the end we dont need to go back too many generations before we all find a connection to one another.But you can have kids if you like... there are ways.How did you come to the realization that youre gay? Or how did you go from being really straight to being into guys? Did it just dawn on you? Was it something you suppressed? Coming out is tricky depending on where you live and whether people in your life will accept you. Happy to discuss with you if you like.,comingout,daio821,1,t5_2rw9q
10172261,0,t3_5lnq5c,The reacting to pushing bit and it looking like it was a reaction to the coming out is unfortunate. I would say just explain it to your bf and your brother and apologise that it was confusing.As for the judging and stuff one sentence you said really stuck out to meDo gay people not take under consideration that some people have the right to oppose...You have exactly the same right to your opinions as everyone else. With regards to this though you have the same right to oppose that you would have with any straight couple.None.No right  whatsoever.If you feel like a link is there with AIDS having seen it with your uncle then get him the information on safe sex and AIDS prevention. Being gay does not equal AIDS.You dont have get on the boat with people being gay and you can judge them but that is called bigotry. Plain and simple. Please consider that in this you are in the wrong and you should look into changing your view.,comingout,dbx2yf8,5,t5_2rw9q

11239456,0,t3_60ecmz,Thats a really difficult situation to be in and Im sorry that is where you are. I guess personally Id live my life for me since its the only one you get. True you might be worse off financially but mentally you will likely be much better. The other option is no different from prostitution really... Youre doing something you would not otherwise do for financial reasons. Is there anyone in your family who you know its not homophobic that you could talk with? Some people who are homophobic on the surface quickly change their tune when it affects a loved one so you might be lucky I suppose. If you do tell him then maybe assure him that its not going to be in his face etc. Whatever you decide to do good luck to you and remember we are here for you. If you need to chat send me a message. ,comingout,df5z5dk,8,t5_2rw9q
