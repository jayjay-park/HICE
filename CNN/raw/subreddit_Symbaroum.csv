6202480,0,t1_cybsb9n,Take a look at the PDF again. The Guard Warrior has the Iron Fist  Novice rank ability. Hes clearly superior to the Village Warrior.Iron Fist  Novice Rank. Page  Novice Passive. The character can fully utilize itsstrength and therefore uses Strong insteadof Accurate then making a melee attack.Just wanted to clarify this for people in case they read old information and get confused. The Guard Warrior is a beast. Edit I saw this was posted above but double FYI? p,Symbaroum,cyunmdd,1,t5_3arwr

Personally i think the information written in the players handbook were a bit much and i wouldve appreatiated finding out the information ingame instead. ,Symbaroum,cz6f29q,3,t5_3arwr
7868981,0,t3_4n29jo,Cool initiative. I just ordered the hardcover and was thinking about GMing a oneshot with my group so I looked forward experiencing it firsthand. Too bad the timeslot doesnt work for me in Europe. Have a good time though. ,Symbaroum,d40jogk,3,t5_3arwr
8960836,0,t3_52ztbe,The mystic can remotely write characters and symbols on a wellknown place for the mystic. The characters appear on a flat surface such as a wall a floor or a table.The mystic must know the location well within the location the mystic can write on a flat surface.I would suggest the mystic needs to know the flat surface exists. If someone moved something into the room in their absence they would not have a preternatural knowledge of the new surfaces existence.,Symbaroum,d7oyhrx,1,t5_3arwr
9158894,0,t3_55r088,Yeah finding a group can be a mission. Im sure there are others in the same boat. If there was enough intrest we could try getting a game going via roll depending on time zones..... Dosnt have to be a long running adventure but at the very least Im sure some people would be keen to play a one shot of the promised land or some other adventure.,Symbaroum,d8cygzx,1,t5_3arwr
9570359,0,t3_5c0p9z,I think its official that you need to use your movement action to waitmanoeuvre to get a clear shot. Then no additional problems. Thats at least how we have done it. And it works really well. Since you need your movement to reload crossbows etc. Or just get out of combat...,Symbaroum,d9sqpro,2,t5_3arwr

10095822,0,t3_5ka9w2,I had a Hexwraith have the remains of his labs there. He had a pile of speaking Frostlights and shadows that would slowly swarm any strong source of heat but would talk as if they were simply the servants and slaves of their master.At the end of the short ruin was a broken rotted desk a chair with a recently desiccated ranger a stack of dead Barbarian bodies for later use and the bones of the Sorcerer never properly put in his tomb.When in residence the wraith would allow people in and play them in dayslong boardgames until they bored him or proved hostile. When there was no one living he would call forth spirits of those who were once sworn to them from the Earth Towers themselves in an attempt to keep his mind sharp.My party burned his few earthly remains that he had out for guests and use and disrupted his balance so Ive been working on a side adventure following where a group of undead mercilessly butchered some acolytes they swore to help and left them a note that said We were content to rule over or feed on the ashes.,Symbaroum,dbni11z,4,t5_3arwr
10607555,0,t1_dd3dzh3,Ive been trying to hide the few rolls that NPCs have to make for stuff like that by sneakily asking my players to roll random tests mixed in with real rolls for example Roll Vigilant twice and tell me both numberssuccesses. Do you have insert sometimes meaningful trait or ability here?It keeps players somewhat off my trail when Im trying to surprise them though the trick is keeping track of when checks need to be made for the NPC and making sure that you dont end up screwing up the players because of it. Otherwise I totally just ask someone to roll for me when I dont think it matters that they know OOC or IC... On the other hand if a mystic power is being used for something that directly influences the plot like the start of an adventure or a seed for something new then I DO sometimes fudge the NPCs rolls or just let an NPC maintain power until it is noticed so long as it isnt making things too unfair for the players.,Symbaroum,dda36b4,1,t5_3arwr
10663016,0,t3_5s7e5j,My group did almost everything they could to avoid interacting with Xanath having a lot of healthy distrust of psychic creatures and forest deities. This made some things interesting. The group also avoided dealing with the cultists outside the tomb which meant that they were theoretically going to face a dozen angry and dangerous people on their way out.Immediately after entering the tomb the group lost its rogue changeling. She had been possessed by HurianLoApak since she smashed his skull weeks earlier back in the Hold. She slipped away as Hurian took over and I handed the player a stack of notes to let them explore the tomb with the kings insight. The character was doomed since she made that mess at the end of Mark of the Beast but I felt the subtle possession would be more fun for everyone involvedIt took a while before the other players noticed she was missing and by the time they pursued her the kings door had closed again. The group was extremely nervous about the trapped door and eventually the groups wizard reluctantly ordered his flaming servant to perform the opening rite while everybody took cover. Eventually they got through but they did not think to block the door from closing so now they were trapped inside the tomb.While the wizard examined the dormant flaming servants the groups ranger and witch noticed an unfamiliar shape in the throne room. The changeling had at this point assumed King Hurians appearance and was ranting in ancient Symbarian. When the interlopers entered the room he ordered his fiery protectors to awaken and the wizard barely escaped the ensuing inferno by ordering his own flaming servant to block the narrow entrance.King Hurian managed to drink one drop of the dark treacle before the ranger shot the vial out of the kings hands. The wizards flaming servant was performing admirably as a spartan completely blocking the doorway to the room of the fire robots and probably saving the entire group as a result.The ranger and the witch made short work of Hurian but only realized it was their travelling companion when they chopped her head off. The group had already lost a player character in the adventures opening scene to a pack of marecats so this was the second death of the adventure. After dealing with the undead king the group slowly chipped away at the enemy fire spirits and the witch managed to get them a way out by transforming into a bird and flying the long way around back to the kings door. The group grabbed the Vile Water and headed out opting not to breach the wards of the treasure chamber but were intercepted by the spider Xanath who desperately begged them to surrender the dark artefact. They did as she asked and she fled along the treetops  pursued by a cloud of angry darkness.The fleeing sun and night moved through the cultists camp draining everybody there everyone except MalRogan the groups nemesis who was mysteriously missing and allowing the group to escape back to civilization.The group has since stopped in Kurun where they have been entangled in a messy web of crime politics and dark magic. After they sort that out they will probably have the means to fund another expedition to the Field of Dying Dreams with the aim to harvest the resources to produce a lot of purple sap.,Symbaroum,ddft4kk,3,t5_3arwr
10862776,0,t3_5v4drc,Wow this was indeed a strange one ... Very curious that no Swedish gamer or proof reader have picked it up before now.In any case the intention is that the Witchbraid should deduct  from the outcome of the die roll removing the risk for direct death  and increasing the chance of a quick recovery .,Symbaroum,de0f32f,4,t5_3arwr
11027003,0,t3_5xdb7u,Oh this is brilliant! I am even more curious about the PC will react when learning the fate of hisher kin.That said the person you are talking about I dont think that she makes much difference between this character and someone else. Just let her react to the PC as the loner she is.,Symbaroum,dehvwgp,3,t5_3arwr
11174499,0,t3_5zj5uv,In tabletop terms its exactly as long as it needs to be. Symbaroum is not a system that deals with particularly exact numbers and this ability is a perfect example of how the designers intended the game to be played. How far do I have to move to get around that obstacle?Hmm... Id say you have to take two movement actions to get there  so its going to take your entire turn.Its an ability where player creativity and GM fiat comes into play heavily. And the enemy positioning and how many the player can block with the wall is up to the GM. If the enemies are all rushing down a hallway the wall will be able to stop them in their tracks. If the enemies approach from one direction in open field they will try to move around. If the enemies have the players surrounded only a few of the enemies will be impeded by the wall. ,Symbaroum,deym82a,4,t5_3arwr
11196887,0,t1_df0x51b,The other problem with trying the nonmystic route is you still suffer full corruption using your power unless you eventually take that tradition.This is the case with the Other Mystic path as well unless you toss another xp at it but it also opens up rounding out the character with some other cool things while you are at it. ,Symbaroum,df15ji4,2,t5_3arwr

11246726,0,t3_60hqe8,Yeah.  I jumped on it as soon as I was reminded that it started today and I was backer  iirc and it was already up around the first stretch goal by that point.,Symbaroum,df6sso0,2,t5_3arwr
