257743,0,t3_1x06e8,Just find an all purpose glutenfree replacement mix.  King Arthurs Domata Hodgens Mill and other brands are all fine.  As long as it has xantham gum or guam gum included which are nonwheat gluten substitutes you can replace the flour in your recipe with it.Sift your gluten free flour  Gluten free cakes can be dense as it is harder to get them to gain the lift and fluffiness that flour allows.  Sifting helps.  You can sift in a food processor which also helps further grind up the gf flour to make it finer.Consider using honey in the place of the sugar  Either half or all of it.  It is a  replacement but honey will make things more moist.  In most glutenfree cakes the problem is a drier grittiness that comes from some of the different types of flours.  Adding a little moisture helps smooth that out.  You could also substitute applesauce for the oil.  It is healthier will usually help with the grittiness and a little apple flavor would go well with a carrot cake.,glutenfreecooking,cf7gzb0,1,t5_2taej

3916420,0,t3_357k1n,I use a CupCup flour clone and I find that it works so well that I dont even need to bother finding recipes billed as glutenfree  I simply replace their flour with mine and it works perfectly EDIT or close enough to perfectly that it doesnt matter. So just find yourself a good chocolate cake recipe and use GF flour. Something like this or this or thisAs an aside I wrote myself a calculator to use to make any quantity of the flour based on the amount of the constituent ingredients I have on hand. Its not in a place I want to share but if theres enough demand I could find a place to host it.,glutenfreecooking,cr2phmp,1,t5_2taej
