You can keep them forever no matter if you stop subscribing. Those are actual free games. Sony are allowing you to rent the games they give away.

425144,0,t1_cfom1xk,Agreed. If you were stuck on a desert island with Dark Souls and guide  at all it would be a terrible game. And a game shouldnt rely on guides to be playable. Also the fact that the game necessitates farming and level grinding is pretty damning. The lore is terrible so alien and arbitrary that I dont care about the world and the world feels empty. Siegemeier has a daughter? How the fuck is that possible? There is no romance in this horrid world. I couldnt imagine people having sex in this hell. Oh and locking me into moves is not some brilliant deep combat system. I want to be able to control my character not be locked into a move once I start it so that everything becomes timing. And rolling shouldnt protect you from shit. If Im fighting someone in real life and they roll that is when theyre the most vulnerable.

GTA V is a better game in my opinion if a little shorter.I would not get another hard drive for the  if you are planning to upgrade in a few months its just dead money unless you can use the drive for something else.Also just since I made this same sort of transition here is why I switched from my  to PC instead of an XB. I basically decided Im never buying another console.. Games. Dont have to buy the same game twice ever again. I own GTA  on multiple systems PS  and its not the only game. Dont have to worry about losing investment in game because i got rid of that system like all my ps games. Once I own it on PC I own and can play it forever.. Controller  I spent less than  and i can keep using all my  controllers on my PC. If I want to use an XB controller I can do that. If I want KeyboardMouse can do that.. Upgrades  your storage space is a super easy upgrade as is pretty much any performance part. Certainly no more expensive than buying a new console every few years.. Repairs. No obscure RROD. Any issue you run into is a much easier fix IMO because every part of the computer is replaceable within reason. Not to say you cant or shouldnt still go for a new console but I had basically the same decision and decided I was sick of console swapping. never looked back and I dont really Mod games or do any of that shit.,xbox360,ci42upm,-5,t5_2qhk2

1293441,0,t1_cieefbu,Deus Ex Human Revolution is really great.  The game has an amazing atmosphere and soundtrack and the story is pretty good too.  The game design is also pretty good for the most part there are many different ways to play through the game.  Run through killing everyone sneak around and execute or knock out guards hack things to find secret paths and areas or a mix of different playstyles.The only thing I didnt really care for in the game were the boss battles.  I was trying to be stealthy most of the game so I wouldnt carry loud or big weapons in my inventory.  But then occasionally a boss battle will happen out of the blue and youre stuck with just a pistol trying to take on a boss.  And there are no stealth options for the bosses either the game makes you fight them all head to head.Thankfully there are only a couple of fights like that in the game though and the rest is awesome.  I just figured Id give you my opinion on that game since Ive played it a lot.

1399845,0,t3_2a5jff,This is a hotbutton issue among fans of the Fallout series. Most of the Falloutfaithful those who have played  and  agree that New Vegas is better because its more respectful of the lore. Fallout  is not a bad game but it makes very little sense in the context of the Fallout world.As a Fallout fan myself Ill admit Im biased in favor of New Vegas. But there are valid criticisms of it as well.Fallout  is a more open game that allows for greater exploration. Not many invisible walls blocking your path and it has a very postapocalyptic feel to it. But IMO the whole thing feels dead like they just took a bunch of locations and randomly threw them on the map. In terms of lore it doesnt make sense that the entire outside world still looks like it was nuked yesterday when in fact it has been over  years.The problem with New Vegas is that it railroads you into a specific path early in the game. Every character starts roughly the same way and its not until you reach New Vegas that your options finally branch out. New Vegas also has a smaller map with more invisible walls.

The game is always online and even when you start missions solo without a fire team youll run into other players doing their own thing and can optionally join them. Its kind of like a nontraditional MMO in some respects. Going without a fire team can make some missions pretty hard but still doable at least to me and Im not very good at shooters.Since its always online that means you need a GoldPlus subscription to play the game unless youre playing on PS like me.

2488889,0,t1_cmj9izj,The game was unbalanced heavily. Claymores would very easily get you sky rocketed to the top of the leader board just from laying them near spawns in a FFA match. The camouflage is very mismatched where some colors stuck out BADLY to the maps and others were like shades at night in certain areas yellow camouflage in the fields Field was probably the dedust of Warface but it was spawn camp prone thanks to OP shotgun medics camping the doors and snipers would camp the center walk way. Plus claymores were laid on the side roads. There was a clear one team advantage.The only thing I liked about the game was the on the fly gun mod but I rarely ever had that moment where I felt a need to take  seconds to put on a long range scope to my gun to hit a sniper. I usually just avoided the sniper until I got to his general area anyway.Oh and if you didnt install the game to a hard drive you ran the high risk of having the game just keep crashing on you.,xbox360,cmjfpjl,10,t5_2qhk2

If you have the same budget and size as The Last of Us or Uncharted theres no reason you shouldnt compete with their writing. I had no connection or emotions to any of the characters because they were all utterly twodimensional. The dialogue was offtheshelf and forgettable.

4389619,0,t3_3a6fyg,I know I probably wont get an answer but what do you mean backwards compatibility with the XB?Does that mean it will play  DISCS or just download? I have my XB in pawn since its basically useless to me and I needed money. I pay the interest on it in case I ever want to get it back out. Its useless to me because I dont have internet or put my consoles online even if I do have internet and every other game I get needs to go online to update before I can play it. PS is much better for me since it updates from disc.So if theres an update coming that will allow the XB to play  discs I might have to lug it over to a friends house and get that update. If its just some stupid downloadable games crap Ill keep it in pawn I guess. I guess Im just waiting for my money situation to get better. Once its better Ill get internet so I can get my XB out in case any games I get need to be updated.

After using the license transfer tool youll have to redownload the games.  Dont worry it wont take long  itll notice the game is already there and just reacquire new keys for it. Connect a second controller and on that controller log in with the account that owns the games.  As long as that account is actively logged in the game license is activated and any profile can play it.Ive used both of these techniques myself in the past.,xbox360,ctg7ck2,1,t5_2qhk2

6996463,0,t3_4bh6dx,I started playing with my son when he was . I tried to start him with some super simple games on the Wii but they couldnt hold his interest even at that age.The first hit was with the Lego series. Weve played through all of them now except the two most recent new Avengers and Jurrasic Park. He loves the characters and the humor. The puzzles are just hard enough to be engaging but easy enough for him to usually figure out on his own.We then played Terraria for a good long time. He enjoyed the fighting and crafting but I really had to hold his hand through the crafting process because if you cant read its not really intuitive.Then he found Minecraft and thats been about all we have played for the last year hes almost  now. He can play with me or his mom in survival mode or with his friends in creative. Its really amazing some of the structures and contraptions they will come up with. Its also fun to see how he takes what he learns in Minecraft and applies it to the real world. He took what he learned building model ships in the game and used that to build a boat that won a sailing competition at parent teacher conferences this year. On the th day of school they had to paste  things on a poster board. He took  green and black squares of construction paper and made a giant creeper head.Lastly one of his grandfathers is a retired iron worker who has been just over the moon about my sons sudden interest in black smithing. tldr ...

While it is multiplayer you can just do stuff by yourself and not group up if you want and the some of the mini events can be joined by anyone and done cooperatively without anyone having to plan it etc. Its hard to explain but its really nicely done.Kingdoms of Amalur Reckoning  Single player but its got that feel to it.Games Id recommend for anyone who hasnt played them yetall have difficulty settings or are pretty simple to get into for beginnersMass Effect. The story and characters are very engaging.Fable Anniversaryamp are worth playing too but someone else already recommended those. The best of the Fable series imho. Very easy to get into and has a bit of cheesy humour in there.Minecraft. Dont be put off by the fact that its popular with kids its fun for adults too.Terraria. Despite appearances its not a Minecraft clone and is actually really fun to play.Skyrim if she doesnt have a PC to play it onor isnt interested in playing on PCFallout . It can be a bit hard to get into at first but once you get into the wasteland and start doing stuff it grabs you.Mass Effect Skyrim and Fallout all let you customise your character and play as a female character too if thats something that appeals to her. If she likes those theres also Red Dead Redemption. Fable is a bit short if you rush it but any of the others should last her a while.Similar to phone games maybe?Hexic  Nothing too exciting its a free puzzle game pretty fun to play now and again.Kingdom of KeflingsWorld of Keflings. Not sure which is better they both seem popular.Viva Pinata. Its collecting and breeding animals basically. She might find it a bit childish but it is still enjoyable for adults so use your own judgement on that one.There is a version of the sims  for  but if she already has it on PC that version is betterand she can use mods on PC so I wouldnt bother with it. Sims games dont translate to consoles very well really.What else is she into in general? EG Scifihorror nostalgic stuff etc. Does she want to play by herself or with other people?Congrats on the future addition to your family btw!Edit I tried to make sure I hadnt picked ones with any traumatic bits with kidsbabies but I cant remember if Fallout  has any sad stories about kids dying in there its a possibilityNot sure if your wife is feeling a bit sensitive to that stuff atm but some pregnant women do seem to. ,xbox360,d5ziuwm,2,t5_2qhk2

8808662,0,t3_50se7a,Get the Xbox  S slim or Xbox  E model. Those do not have the red ring of death issue but they will also will be the most expensive. Get one with the  GB hard drive or bigger. Buying used from gamestop or anywhere else is fine as long as its one of the models mentioned above. Live is not free but not required for couch co op. Only required for online play. ,xbox360,d76oj2i,7,t5_2qhk2
8810790,0,t1_d76kyzd,The E seems like it was mainly designed to reduce production costs.  It has no optical audio less USB ports and the old school mechanical buttons instead of the touch sensitive buttons.  It should be just as good as the slim as far as longevity goes but its a bit of a step down in features and ascetic quality.That being said its easier to find an E with a GB hard drive if you want that and you can probably find an E brand new while most S models will be used.,xbox360,d76xr2h,1,t5_2qhk2

8908907,0,t1_d7i2igs,Original Xbox gameplay bugs     long loading times that at times will crash. Not as bad in the GOTY edition.     save bug. The longer you save an exact file the bigger it gets. Ones it gets big enough it becomes prone to just corrupting. One way to remedy this was to have multiple saves. They will still corrupt in time.      slowdowns when casting some magic when a lot of characters are on screen. Some say it would lock up but I never had that problem.    A few others I cant remember but these were the most memorable.      If you play it on  you will encounter a few extra bugs.      saving is still bugged. A huge turn off considering how big the game is.   loading is even more prone to crashing.    slowdowns become way more noticeable especially when casting magic no matter how many characters are on screen.      characters randomly disappear. No clue why.     Again there are more but thats all I remember. Its a fun game. But expect to encounter bugs. Way more than on the pc version. The steam Version also has a complete overhaul mod that updates graphics and gameplay mechanics as well as it fixing small glitches.      I get wanting to play it on the couch. I guess of youre not planning on completing it and just playing until you cant anymore. You should be fine. Talking about Morrowind is making me get an itch for it.,xbox360,d7ipywh,2,t5_2qhk2

I tried downloading GWG not available for my console regionVegas  Tron. I was not able to download them through my console xbox marketplace so I did the VPN trick. It was downloaded automatically to my console once I logged on Xbox Live. I was able to finish the download yet I wasnt able to play the game. I verified with other forums and the majority says its because the game region is not compatible with my xbox region. If I have a US console maybe itll work?
