290029,0,t1_cfaa5tu,Hmm that is a great question I did not think of that. I would say having full movement is a little ridiculous because then you have hadeszhong ult combination which would be way overpowered for the damage it would do if you could move alongside a target for the full .s. On the flip side if you cant move at all then it would be fairly easy to avoid unless teammates were forcing them into it and being a squishy mage it would be easy for enemies to turn on you. The only compromise the comes to me is to be rooted if the ultimate is cast on you but then allow the player to use their  to throw it to a target and let the ult finish its time at the new location but not he vice versa as mentioned above. This i think creates a good balance it doesnt force you to be rooted to go through your ultimate if you control you cooldowns correctly and it gives you opportunity to hit people with escapesdashes for more damage as the  slow wont keep enemies in there for long.,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,cfatqxq,1,t5_2xy2u
397861,0,t3_1yi4ns,not a bad idea i like how he switches stances but there are some problemspassive. i dont understand does this frost image attack? does it just explode the slow on people? what does it do?.giving him pretty much built in qins sais in his melee stance is a bit ridiculous also you have to have something that gives him something for ranking up the ability like maybe having it be if you must stick with the built in qins sais idea .. of life lost in melee and have the slow be  .his melee stance does way too much damage at rank one if you hit all your shots thats  damage which is beyond over powered.  maybe droping it down to  damage per tick.  Also during this can he move? or is it like anubiss ?.if you were to take out the heal and the return ability his  would be just fine.maybe frostbite as the name because you have to move to prevent it instead of having it be that you have to get so far from the edge have it so that if you stop moving in that  seconds then you take damage because if you hit someone with the center of it theyd have to go halfway in short lane to avoid taking damage. If you were to do this you could make the slow bigger like overall good idea he just sounds like hed be op a fuck ,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,cfm05pi,1,t5_2xy2u

852649,0,t1_ch0v4ih,I completely agree with everything said here.A meleemagical doesnt a guardian automatically make. In English its not essentially entirely true. I want to see Ares step out from behind the guardian moniker and become a magical WARRIOR. I mean gods dammit. And lets be honest Guan Yu and Wukong are played more as guardians or supports than actual brawlers. The idea that certain class definitions should be bonded to certain attack combinations is kinda redundant. With warriors being basically DPSTanks and and the actual guardians kinda lacking in the ability to do a lot of guarding. Its no wonder that people play the warriors over the guardians. However bring out a physical guardian with ability focus rather than actual auto attack focus and hes be fantastic same with a melee magical carryHunter. In my honest opinion the class system needs to be less limiting as it stands Hirez should really branch out what different classes mean and start segmenting them based on their ability types RATHER than how and with what they do damage. A guardian should defend his teammates.  A warrior should initiate and cause havoc. A hunter should seek out the fleeing enemies.  An assassin should take out those that stray from the group  And a mage should focus on dealing massive damage over an area. Let them be the strange and unnerving combinations that we fear being over powered and balance them to suit but tailor their abilities to suit their role rather than their damage type dictating their role. ,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,ch178xz,2,t5_2xy2u

Reminds me of something i tried to do for my Phobetor concept You did it way better tho XDFirst I again like XD But as TheIceSheperd said and you changed it it is rather short. Even ft is short. And why not just have it do extra damage on top of his normal attack make it a ranged scaled back extra damage buff.Second The radius is TINY!  is Time Rift or Flame Strike. And considering this ability does no actual damage I dont see any issue with the radius being around ish. Very unique ability I like a lot XDThird Not bad at all but as TheIceSheperd said ft is tiny. I have no idea how large jumps are but I would think that they are longer than that.I like the ult. I agree with everything TheIceSheperd said about it.

1627594,0,t1_cjjuw5d,Interesting input let me just clarify the effects of his passive.His st passive affects enemies. It gains stacks on each individual enemy for every x seconds they are in vision as defined by the minimap. Stacks fall off at a set rate when they are not in vision LOS does not effect vision. Also I didnt intend to state how often stacks are placed on an enemy. its not  per second and if it was that ammount it would be substantially lower.His nd passive affects allies. He shares his knowledge with allies within a set range of him. The range is small enough that a jungler for example would have to come into lane with him to recieve it.For the moment the way people would tell between the buffsdebuffs is via distinctive icons. The purpose of showing the debuff to the enemies means that they are aware when his global presence i.e. his  can affect them. Having stacks build for any enemy would make it alot easier to gain them essentially just meaning he has a stun on cooldown for one of his abilities. When it comes to allies determining their advantage over enemies it would be in the form of an enemy overhead indicator showing something.,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,cjkbn8v,1,t5_2xy2u

Most of the Hawaiian pantheon works really well as mages or guardians so I had to try and do some creative tweaking to build hunters and warriors out of a few characters. I ended up having two of each class for the  gods Ive worked on partially by luck and partially by design so that was nice. About half of the gods you worked on I did not include in my pantheon. Some of that was because I really liked your ideas and whatever I made would end up either too similar or worse and also because I wanted them to work together as a kind of total pantheon thing. ,SMITEGODCONCEPTS,cp5bwig,1,t5_2xy2u

3319755,0,t1_cp6o94k,I do see what you mean. However that makes certain parts of the kit flow less with the rest of the kit. The bleed and the bleed interactions are the most unique things about her. I like it a lot though losing  of your health every second for up to s does seem like a bit much perhaps  would be a little more balanced? and it should definitely be the centerpiece of the kit as it is. It is most certainly a quality vs. quantity argument. I do strongly feel however that a way to combine both is adjusting the passive to make it scale off of a different stat.

5600379,0,t3_3rstwh,Hey I read the kit and I think its amazing. I swear he would be my favorite god if he is eventually put into the game. But I would like to change his passive a bit. I think his inkwell should regenerate  of the health from the previously killed enemy. Because in this kit he is a mage and mages usually have low health and low protections but can deal a lot of damage. With the regeneration buff it would help the god with absorbing damage. Because with the kit now he is only a problem when coming out of the fountain which is a problem during mid to late game because at that time the passive will be unusable. With the regeneration Acat will be forced to build tanky or damaging to survive. I say this because he already has a high damage kit so building him tanky will allow him to take on more god in  on  situations but also building him in a damage focused way would force the player to think smart and only take on gods in lanes or in an area where there are more weaker enemies to farm and regenerate his passive on.

However i feel that it may be smarter to reserve the role as god of chaos more majorly for apophis and instead maybe let it be less dominant in sets lore and abilities. While i love the portable xbalanque ult he better be able to do some form of damage or be strong if it follows him since enemies will simply turn on him and try to kill him as they do to hades. I for one would love to see either him or apophis with an ability based off of insanit? Perhaps a global cc effect that causes players abilities to be scrambled? your  is your  your  is your  your  is your  and your  is your ? switch the buttons? that would be amazing and much more creative imagine the combonations that could cause? if anything to balance its strength make apophis a guardian and give him that ability as an ultimate for teamfights.

9421589,0,t1_d9a7yg5,Alright I like the compromise you proposed. All basic attacks makes sense and limiting the amount of projectiles seems like a good way to balance it.I just assumed that the true damage would also be to strong for the laning phase but maybe not as  damage isnt that much. One thing i will say is that true damage never has scaling because true damage on its own is already extremely powerful as protections and damage reduction dont diminish the damage it deals. I would increase the damage slightly but remove the scaling if you want to keep it dealing true damage so that it deals  true damage without scaling. Also is it possible to cancel Stone Block while you are using it? because if not bad positioning could screw up your team as they will just ignore you and go for your carries.But yeah thanks for responding so quick.
