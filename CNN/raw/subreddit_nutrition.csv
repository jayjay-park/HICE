I define a good source of something as having a higher percentage than the other macros like a whey powder with a disproportionately high protein content compared to fat and carbs. With its nutrient profile milk can very easily be worked into someones daily calorie and macronutrients goals. However if I were looking in increase the level of just one macro in my diet like protein I would want a source without as many of the other macros. ,nutrition,cegnz60,1,t5_2qoox

If you end up with a strong correlation between alcohol and death once you fit the right curve U J linear exponential etc. the main worry is that someone else is simultaneously affecting alcohol consumption and mortality in an equal manner. Example Having a lighter in your pocket at any given time is highly correlated with future incidence of lung cancer. The confounder is that smoking causes both. To determine what they ask about epidemiologists rely on other sciences physiology nutrition etc. and other epi studies to see what has a causal link to your independent and dependent variables of interest.

1156614,0,t3_27dc9f,Yes it is very much an addiction in the same way drugs are. Food reacts with our bodies and brains just as much as any drug will. What your body is craving is known as comfort food and it is a serious problem in todays world especially with so many triggers ease of going through the drive through advertisements on every billboard and television etc. It will go away just like every addiction but never beat yourself up for falling into old habits. It will take a while to make new habits just like it took a while for you to fall into your current routine. Make the conscious effort to limit your soda intake. One serving size is about  oz so that should be your goal everyday is to have ONE soda or less. These people and their big gulps are going to have diabetes by the end of the night but you youve decided to do something and asking was the first step. When youre ready to take the next you must simply wake up and say Todays the day and when you feel a craving you fight it just like an ill begotten disease. You take your stick of celery with nut butter and dried fruit and you beat the craving right out of you. You do it again and again and again until it is within your submission. Never ease up for a second or it will get up to try to ruin your body from the inside all over again.

1260723,0,t3_28egrq,Smoothies are great I think. Not recipes but I wanted to share some tips for making great tasty smoothies. Frosty cold smoothies are the best  use one or two frozen fruits or a handful or two of ice cubes. A chilled glass is even better. . Use ripe fruit it has the most flavour toss underipe fruit into your smoothie and youre heading for underwhelming. . Experiment with new tastes  a handful of parsley a tablespoon of seeds or nuts a new fruit youve never tried before. . But dont add a zillion ingredients  its not supposed to be hard  make it easy and simple. . Cut up your ingredients if you dont have a topoftheline blender make sure you give it a helping hand. . Freeze your fruit and veg for year round favours. Make sure you peel and chop them into small chunks first ever tried to peel a frozen banana? Great ones to freeze are grapes spinach kiwi berries bananas but you can freeze anything almost. . Bananas are smoothie rock stars  besides thickening your drink and making it creamy bananas are an awesome base they go well with practically everything because they have a neutral taste.Plus. For a creamy smoothie include avocado bananas mango peach andor pear. . For a more watery smoothie use fruits with a lot of juicewater content  like oranges limes mandarins grapes melon and kiwi. . For a chunkier and thicker smoothie depending on how long you blend it for use more ice and frozen fruit. But remember too much ice and you will have a sorbet on your hands. . For a lighter smoothie blend it for longer to allow more air in  this will vary depending of course on what ingredients you use. . For a smoother smoothie add yoghurt  thats almost a tongue twister. . If you are new to green smoothies and a bit unsure try baby greens first they usually have a milder flavour than mature greens same with cucumber spinach and zucchini they are gentler in flavour.Hope this helps a bit.More info here www.goodsmoothieguide.com ,nutrition,cibg3iq,2,t5_2qoox

Make smoothies or shakes with ice cream full fat yogurt or heavy cream.  Make oatmeal with heavy cream or whole milk.

I use a chicken breast an entire lemon squeezed with the peels left on the chicken and a dallop of canola oil butter. I then set it to bake. Again very few ingredients so I just count them up.It should be noted that I dont count calories anymore so I havent actually counted the calories in these dishes for a few years. If you want to lose weight I would suggest simply eating healthier and smaller portions spaced out throughout the day. Also drinking lots of water! To keep me on top of my water consumption I have a two liter pitcher that I have to empty every day in addition to any other liquids I drink. Counting calories can lead to obsessive behavior and doesnt guarantee that the weight will stay off. Changing your lifestyle will ensure that your success continues on for years.Good luck!,nutrition,ckfq7kj,1,t5_2qoox

And if youre overshooting your carb intake you could try just turkey rollups with lettuce and other toppings rolled inside instead of a sandwich. Ive also been making a chicken salad with greek yogurt instead of mayo. Its a pretty good substitute which adds extra protein from the greek yogurt while slashing the fat. If you do this youll have to play around with the flavoring as the greek yogurt alone wont be flavorful enough.

But the fruits with more micronurients also have a lot of unique phytonutrients as well so at the end of the day its safe to say that the more nutrientdense fruits are still the better picks.But part of the problem of looking at uncapped total micronutrients is that fruits with offthechartlevels of vitamin C are at the top even though they might have lowerlevels of the other micronutrients.

Organic grass fed low temp nonhomogenized dairy of that is your ONLY option is better than grocery store options but the damaged nutrition on pastuerized dairy isnt worth it. The reason people still persist with OA is that they lack the cofactors needed for proper calcium absorbption. Without proper systemic pH key hormones proper hydration other minerals like magnesium in proper ratio proper fatty acids vitamin D amp proper digestion humans cannot properly extract amp assimilate calcium into the body. All of these factors must be working or the body will continue to leach calcium from the bones for its needs and not be able to effectively and efficiently replace whats lost. There are plenty of nondairy sources of calcium Americans ingest plenty of calcium they just cannot assimilate it into the body as a consequence the excess calcium gets deposited in inappropriate tissues i.e. kidney stones amp  calcification of arteries.

It doesnt matter what kind of food you choose its just a matter of calories consumed vs. calories expended. Ideally you should eat more and keep your exercise routine the same. This is probably the healthiest way to add body fat. You could achieve a similar result by decreasing the amount of exercise you do and leaving your diet the same but why not continue to exercise to maintain your muscle mass and just eat more to add body fat?

I just pulled those numbers out of a dark corner of my memory so could be wrong. However and Ive noticed this going back to my college days Green Tea helps me focus in a way that coffee doesnt Have recently read that its due to a syngergistic action between Caffeine and LTheanine a chemical in Tea. Anyway Id say I drink about  mugs of green tea per day and I brew it from loose leaves so I usually end up making in stronger than you might from a teabag. I havent had any major health problems from this. If anything its been a positive as Ive more or less gotten rid of the haze between waking up and making coffee. Im now pretty alert in the mornings which wasnt the case before. All in all Im pretty happy with the change. Cant think of many other drinks that are better for you.

If you have extra to spend after that put it into your meat  this is expensive but avoiding antibiotics and growth hormones are so important. Then move onto your fruits  think skin you eat so apples peaches berries plums etc. Vegetables are tougher choices but potatoes and lettuce  use A LOT of pesticides and I always choose organically there then carrots rutabaga beets. Things like onion and garlic dont have much of a pest issue and not a heck of a lot of pesticides are used on them so it may not be worth the dollars. Always purchasing organic is friendlier to the environment because everything is connected and pesticides used on farms enters the soil and waterways. Remember that pesticides herbicides and insecticides are designed to kill living things not just the targeted pest. Farming practices of dairy cows create ample opportunity for infection so they are pumped full of antibiotics to treat and prevent mastitis. We know super bugs are a real threat due to overuse of antibiotics but  of antibiotic use is agricultural. Human growth hormone is used in beef cows to decrease turnover time. You eat this.

4337329,0,t1_cseek5d,No AA supplements cannot increase how much you absorb.  Ill back up a bit.You eat protein in some form steak beans protein powder etc.  Then the stomach separates the protein from the food it came from.  Then the small intestine breaks down the protein into amino acids and peptides.  Then those amino acids and peptides are absorbed from your small intestine and taken to your bloodstream and thus the liver by a carrier transport system.  This protein carrier transport system has a maximum rate at which it can do its job but we do not have a good idea of what a good average rate is.  The carrier transport system is composed mainly of protein themselves that cells in the intestines produce but the amount is finite so there has to be a maximum rate.There are  types of carrier proteins each one specializing in moving a different amino acid or peptide into your bloodstream to reach your liver and beyond.  There are single amino acids that dont have a carrier protein associated with them so they cannot be absorbed on their own and must be absorbed as part of a peptide either a di or tripeptide.  On this basis I question the efficacy of Amino Acid supplements as opposed to whole protein supplements like Whey or meat.,nutrition,csejozm,1,t5_2qoox

Your weight changes so much daily for so many reasons its almost detrimental to weigh yourself daily because one day you may be up multiple pounds just because of water or food and you get discouraged. Also its good to wait a week or so after changing carbs for your water weight to stabilize itself. Waking up after changing carbs and seeing your weight go up or down by like  pounds can feel kind of crazy! Also tracking your weight and just seeing the overall long term decline can be comforting in a way knowing your actually progressing.

Being  lbs when you walk down a street almost everybody looks fatter than you and im sure you can agree. So you start to feel like you yourself might be too thin. I am not the most muscular man at this moment. Hence why i felt i needed to pack on more mass and eat more. I used to be into weight lifting alot back when i was  years old. Made it all the way to lbs of pure muscles at and  body fat...granted the way i reached those numbers werent necessary the best. And i just realized thanks to all you guys that maybe i fucked up my perception since.     So i guess i will try to be within the BMI. I wanna be healthy and feel good in my own body  I feel some pain in jointsmuscles from old sports injuries and my range of motion sucks.

Fats breaks down to sugar eventually for transport in the blood and proteins can help facilitate the oxidation of glucose at important steps throughout metabolism eventually leading to increased blood glucose.  Sugar comes in hundreds of forms however I assume you are talking about added sugar?  If you are consuming a balanced diet with a reasonable macronutrient distribution you dont NEED any added sugar.  Sugar comes from other food products youd consume like starch milk fruit legumes  etc.  Your diet should range from  carbohydrate.

Basically anything that isnt a processed vegetable or seed oil and has a high enough smoke point for cooking.This list is a good reference to see what ratios of omegas are in different oils. Things like EVOO are basically neutral in their omega ratios things like flax oil are actually highe rin omega  and vegetable oils are very high in PUFA and very low in omega . Canola oil is  omega  which is not terrible but it all depends on the context of the whole diet. Some oils are just bad all around like soybean oil which is used in many processed foods on the shelf and many dressings.Personally I like to cook my meat with either grassfed buttertallow coconut oil or bacon grease depending on the recipe and I add a good quality EVOO to my salads and I stay away from any kind of dressingmayoetc. that is shelf stable at the grocery store. Again Im not saying if you eat a meal thats high in vegetable oil that youll keel over but its all about eating well for the majority of your meals and keeping that balance. If you do that you will be much healthier than  of the western population unfortunately.There is also research supporting the idea that increasing your omega  intake can help offset a high omega intake when it comes to things like inflammation. So if you are eating a fair amount of omega  throughout the week you could probably balance that out with a fish oil supplement or eating a big piece of salmon twice a week. ,nutrition,d2028t6,3,t5_2qoox

What do you think of this large study  and the WHO classification of red meat as a carcinogen ? For your circulation article it seems that it would be very hard to find a large American cohort that eats only unprocessed red meats to separate the effects of preparation and Comorbid conditions. The article you linked to for cancer appears to acknowledge a heightened risk for red meat consumption but states that the magnitude of this risk is lower than processed meats. I personally omit red meat but I agree the data is far from conclusive and it may be if you eat minimally processed healthy red meat you have no impact on longevity see African tribes who eat gobs of whole milk and red meat almost exclusively and have low incident of coronary disease ,nutrition,d3mgkgg,1,t5_2qoox

I think you should go for a I think this video is great for people struggling with food addiction. Explaining why they never feel satisfieddont get satisfied soon enough. I dont think calorie counting will give you a great result because the second you stop youre probably going to gain weight again. I do think diets like the one they talked about in the video will work for you. Search for the mcdougall program and you will find one. I dont think you should follow the advice to avoid coffee tea and cacao though. I would also eat more fruits than he recommend. Maybe this is not for you I get that. Many people get awesome results this way and when you find recipies you like it becomes very enjoyable. As you struggle with food addiction I cant think of anything bettet than an eat as much as you want type of diet. There are incredible many weight loss strategies. Many of them give results but sadly are very unhealthy. The diet recommended here is as healthy as it gets and on average people lose lbs a month. Increasing amount of exercise can work but people gain the weight whenif they stop exercising. Calorie counting often resuluts in a low volume of food and you might have to stop eating before feeling satisfied. Eating lowmedium calorie foods will allow your body to properly tell you when you should stop eating. Effortlessly achieving and keeping a healthy bodyweight becomes very easy when eating this way.

Dr. McDougall is a regular doctor  he is a boardcertified internist who centers his practice around nutrition.  He promotes a plantbased diet centered around wholefood cooked starches such as potatoes corn rice sweet potatoes beans and legumes and wholefood grains if the patient can tolerate them.  On his Website if you click on Education then Success Stories then scrolldown on the righthand side you will see links to sections which have either video testimonials or text testimonials from the many hundreds actually thousands of people  who have seen dramatic improvements in their health from adopting this diet.The fact that you so rarely have solid bowel movements suggests your gut microbiome is all screwed up.  McDougalls diet is high in soft plant fiber.  A person on this diet for a while will have regular healthy bowel movements with solid soft stools.Either buy or borrow from your local library McDougalls book The Starch Solution for more information.  Also McDougall has a ton of videos on YouTube which are very informative.If you do try McDougalls diet keep it very simple at first.  For instance for dinner one night you could cook a pot of boiled potatoes and have some frozen vegetables cooked in the microwave.  Eat half that night and take the other half to work with you next day and reheat in the microwave.  Just keep it simple and slowly add easytoprepare meals to your rotation.The one thing I would definitely do right away is eliminate dairy from your diet and see if that helps.  Try some of the plantbased milks.  I use almond milk and like it very much.Good luck.,nutrition,d4nh0ne,1,t5_2qoox

This sub in particular is already lacking in any kind of evidence based science relying instead on anecdotes or literal homeopathy and may try to sway you towards bullshit cures. the most current scientific review I could find from a quick cursory glance is this its main points in short detail are. Insufficent evidence to link dietary habits to acne . minor case for glycemic loadinsulin response relating to acne but does not explain why obesediabetic persons are not constantly inflamed with acne. ill leave you with their final paragraphDermatologists should not ignore nutritional studies and perhaps the nutritionist should understand better the complexity of skin and sebum production. They should rather work together in elucidating the nature of the beast as it is obvious that much more research is needed to reveal the potential effects of diet or nutrients on acne. We need to understand why people in indigenous societies do not experience acne while in contrast acne is wide spread throughout the Western society. Is diet the sole reason or are other environmental conditions such as stress sun exposure and air pollution important? To prevent acne by dietary manipulation may not be possible but there are scientifically plausible reasons to believe that nutrition can affect acne. To date the research does not prove that diet causes acne but rather influences it to some degree which is still difficult to quantify.,nutrition,d72ro5x,3,t5_2qoox

You have a diet that fulfills this requirement thats a huge first step.But the reason I advocate variety is because each food has a host of different other benefits that arent just our basic vitaminsminerals.  For example garlic and onion dont have much nutrition however both have been shown to be antiinflammatorymost cancers are inflammatory issues.  Lets take garlic for example.  It has a substance called allicin which is a sulfur compound.  Now since I dont have actual studies saved in my bookmarks to illustrate the real science behind this substance Ill stop here.  But Ill leave a link for you to read further.Another factor that you have to consider is things like antioxidantsherbs chocolate and fruit has some phytonutrientsplants or how about the fact that vitamin C helps increase absorption of iron while teacoffeered wine prevents absorption.Also to dive into your diet further.  If your source of fat comes from oil it will be extremely high omega  and low in omega  the ratio will be abysmal.  You also wont be getting much protein I would highly recommend you add beans.

Half the battle with maintaining muscle mass is maintaining activity and you will likely be told to avoid any strenuous exercise although it wouldnt hurt to ask what youre allowed to do and make it a point to continue with some form of movement no matter how limited. Wired jaw surgery complicates this by also making it difficult to get enough calories and recovering from a stressor such as sugery makes your body more likely to preferentially burn muscle over fat.As another poster mentioned protein is important however. Can be found in meal replacements products like Ensure PlusBoost Plus have higher kcalmL than most others with a decent amount of protein powders or you can make your own smoothiesdrinks with full fat milk and yogurt. The sweet stuff gets boring after a while so you could try blended soups or pureed meats. Your medical team might have a handout with ideas and recipes.IMO wired jaw folks often miss out more on fibre than protein as far as major nutrients go... just something to keep in mind.

Also funded by the Atkin Foundation. this one found that blood lipid markers improve in subjects losing weight on a ketogenic diet. This is not proof that a ketogenic diet improves blood lipid markers. We know that losing weight itself improves blood lipid markers. Too bad they didnt include a control. Also funded by the Atkins Foundation. Also doesnt specify the control groups diet Subjects lost weight on a ketogenic diet and blood lipid markers improved. This is not proof that a ketogenic diet improves blood lipid markers.The lowcarbohydrate nonrestrictedcalorie diet aimed to provide  g of carbohydrates per day for the month induction phase and immediately after religious holidays with a gradual increase to a maximum of  g per day to maintain the weight loss.  Is g of carbs ketogenic?  Conclusion Dietary carbohydrate and fat consumption can influencethe density and distribution of LDL and HDL particlesfound in plasma. Highcarbohydrate diets in particularhave been shown to shift the distribution of LDL and HDLtowards smaller and more dense particles.

The science is far from settle on this issue and one of the best study to date that looked at the effect of different subclass pattern on atherosclerosis found that both subclass are associated with its progression. I dont know why anyone would accept high cholesterol level on these preliminary evidences. LDL particle subclasses LDL particle size and carotid atherosclerosis in the MultiEthnic Study of Atherosclerosis MESA.Here is a commentary by one the lead authors explaining the confusion. gtAn important limitation of these studies is th at LDL size was measured using gradient gel electrophoresis which determines only the distribution of LDL subclasses or average LDL size phenotype  large  or  small  but  does  not  quantify  the  number  of  small  versus  large  particles.  In  particular a decrease in average LDL size as measured by gradient gel electrophoresis does not necessarily  translate  into  greater  number  of  small  LDL  particles  since  it  could  also  be  due  to  fewer large LDL particles Figure .  Prior  studies  that  used  gradient  gel  electrophoresis  also  could  not  directly  compare  the  risk  associated  with  small  versus  large  LDL  particles  on  a  per  particle basis.  This  is  important  because  small  LDL  particles  contain  substantially  less  cholesterol  than  large  ones  such  that  at  the same serum concentration of LDL cholesterol LDLc individuals with predominantly small LDL have greater total concentration of LDL particles than those with predominantly large LDL Figure    .  In  addition  prior  studies  did  not  adequately  control  for  the  inverse  correlation  between small and large LDL particle concentrations LDLp and potential confounding due to their  differing  associations  with  other  lipoproteins  lipids  and  traditional  cardiovascular  risk  factors .  gt...gtAfter accounting for particle correlations  we  demonstrated  that  the  magnitude  of association between small LDL and carotid atherosclerosis became equal to large LDL on a per SD basis or less than large LDL on a per particle basis. gtFailure to account for the strong negative  correlation  between  small  and  large  LDL  and  their  different  associations  with  other  lipoproteins  may  underlie  the  belief  that  small  LDL  particles  are  a  more  potent  atherogenic  subclass than large LDL.  There  are  several  mechanisms  that  may  underlie  the  atherosclerotic  effect  of  both  large  and small LDL .They actually found that large LDL could be even more atherogenic than small one when controlling for confounding factor. Here is a good review on this subjectLowDensity Lipoprotein Size and Cardiovascular Disease A ReappraisalgtThis finding suggests that for every unit of time large LDL is just as likely as small LDL to enter the arterial intima. Because large LDL has more cholesterol ester than small LDL a large LDL particle would deposit more cholesterol into plaque than small LDL. Small LDL binds to arterial proteoglycan  in the arterial wall but so does large cholesterolrich LDL . ... Thus it appears that both large and small LDL share undesirable characteristics.gt...gtFinally large cholesterolrich LDL is the predominant type of LDL in familial hypercholesterolemia  and it is firmly established that this LDL is responsible for their premature atherosclerosis. Thus large and small LDL are atherogenic and it is not possible to judge which if any is more harmful overall.,nutrition,dd3p95x,5,t5_2qoox

Saturated fat gt little evidence that it promotes heart disease.I do not think saturated fats are inherently helpful nor harmful. Maybe they see the confounding effect of carbohydrate restriction? Similarly to how a lot of studies think that saturated fats are harmful simply by not controlling against the high baseline refined carbohydrate intake? Nah on second thought I dont think an epidemiological study would pick up on it.gt Monounsaturated is good and provides a protective effect.Confounded by betasitosterol in avocados and oleocanthal in olives at the very least.gt PUFA is neutral.Would like to see a breakdown by source of PUFA whether natural such as nuts and seeds or processed like vegetable oils. I have a suspicion it is positive and negative respectively.gt Fruits and vegetables are mostly neutral but fruits have a greater protective effect in comparison to vegetables.This one I find very hard to believe.gt Legumes are protective.Legumes are inherently less processed than grains it is pretty much a given they will look good compared to baseline diets high in refined carbohydrates. That does not say anything about their inherent health effects however.gt Salt is not a large concern to CVD.

You could also incorporate a lowmercury fish like sardines or wild alaskan salmon. If you eat fish you can drop the fish oil supplement several studies have found it to have no benefit and some commercially available fish oil products go partially rancid. Eat fish or replace it with ground flax seeds for omega. The amount of olive oil seems high try getting some fats from whole foods like avocados instead. Celery has almost no nutritional value unless you love the taste theres no point. You could sub out some of the potatoes for sweet potatoes to get betacarotene. Cooking kale and similar veggies like spinach reduces their oxalic acid content  that would be beneficial if youre going to eat it every day.

11261018,0,t3_60nx2y,I have a solution. For most of my life Im  I have been told that CICO is the only way to lose weight. I understood the idea of thermodynamics and its relativity to diet but I always felt there was a missing piece to the equation as I could name several instances where people gain weight while eating less. Insulin Sensitivity Hormonal Imbalance Muscle Hypertrophy DiseaseInfection etc. So I would typically fight against the whole CICO community. Its not that I would dispute the science of thermodynamics but I would say that the equation is incomplete. Recently I had some great indepth debatesconversations with both sides of the argument here. This is what I feel now in terms of CICO. . No one should say its wrong. And even incomplete is a wrong term. Its the science of thermodynamics and humans are not exempt from it. So dont listen to anyone who says that CICO is wrong. . Doesnt mean CICO is the best way to go about a nutrition guideline. Honestly the problem with CICO is the oversimplification of it. For the last  years I have been told about CICO and every time I heard it I would think... Okay if I want to lose weight than I eat less. But then why am I doing less eating more and losing weight? Well thats because there is more to the puzzle of CO than is your activity levels and intensity. And I dont think that is explained well enough. And when you try to explain it people just get lost and confused. If you go to several sites that can define your caloric needs... You will come away with several different answers. Not only that but I went to a nutritionist and he gave me another different answer far different than what these sites were claiming. I think for the vast majority of people trying to determine what is your Calories Out is not easy and not always accurate. To make matters worse... The equation of calories out is always changing. Day to day... Month to month... Training Cycles to cycle etc. etc. etc. If I gained muscle... Then once again you tell people about CICO and that opens up the idea that you should eat less. Well the first thing to go when you eat less is usually fat. Which is sad because so many people are already lowfat as is. And fat is a crucial nutrient.I also cant help but to think that most people shouldnt lose weight or much weight at all. Most people just need to adjust their macros and they will see a major body composition difference that will make a world of a difference. So I think the issue is over simplification of the CICO equation. Which leads people to making bad decisions. I found this article to be helpful in understanding the equation more if you care to readLast comment  I think most people would have a better time in MEETING THEIR MACROS... They will most likely naturally meet their caloric needs on a daily basis and can easily adjust from there. Most people. Not all. ,nutrition,df8f4ch,6,t5_2qoox

11510293,0,t1_dg0jowf,We also do control meals before our fasts on occasion i.e. having the same dinner before your fast. The main issue I see is the lack of precision in glucometers but theres no way of getting around that other than having several tests run one after another. In one of my studies we continue to test the subjects blood sugar at each set time point until the numbers are within  points of each other. Sometimes the subjects numbers are very close i.e.   other times they are quite spread out i.e.   . Seeing how each test strip is roughly a dollar this would be quite hard to fund yourself. Are you currently testing yourself only once at each timepoint?,nutrition,dg0oyyp,1,t5_2qoox

11520737,0,t3_64dfps,Looks like youve been watching some extremely biased documentaries so its obvious you would come to that conclusion.  Documentaries that set out to prove that animal products are bad inevitably cherry pick information to paint a picture that isnt complete.  Same can be said for any documentary there is an agenda going in.  Stick to the actual science and away from agenda based information.  The reality is animal products can and in my opinion should be part of a balanced healthy diet that includes a sufficient amount of complete proteins with complete amino acid profiles which is easy to get from animal sources of protein as they tend to always be complete sources with plenty of essential amino acids.  Its easy to draw correlations between animal diets and health issues when you dont statistically correct for the fact that many people who eat diets that include high amounts of animal products tend to eat a high amount of fat high amount of cholesterol and a very low amount of fiber.  Any one of these things alone isnt a huge problem besides maybe low fiber intake but when all of them exist together they will lead to health issues every time.  If you eat a balanced diet and actually have a balanced macronutrient intake then animal products are an important part of that extremely healthy diet.gt Or are there benefits that can only be found in animal products The main benefit that I see is that animal sources of protein are always complete protein sources with complete amino acid profiles which people often overlook.  On top of that if youre looking for food sources that are carbohydrate free for whatever reason these will almost always be animal sources of food like meat eggs cheese etc.,nutrition,dg1vl8m,3,t5_2qoox

11642412,0,t1_dgfkzs5,The argument that white rice is healthy because Japanese eat white rice and they are healthy is highly fallacious.Their low rates of heart disease and longevity have more to do with high fish consumption and other dietary factors that offset some negative health effects of intake of refined carbohydrates. They do not reverse all however for example their myopia rates are terrible along with all asian countries.Myopia is yet another manifestation of the metabolic damage caused by carbohydrates. Insulin IGF and hyperglycemia are implicated in its development. I briefly wrote about it in this commentrexplainlikeimfivecommentsinqareliisbadeyesightcausedbystaringatthedbaad.Japanese are not actually that healthy stroke heart disease stomach cancer colorectal cancer liver cancer pancreatic cancer are still among their top causes of death.And for the sake of accuracy alcohol does not contribute to heart disease.

11783691,0,t1_dgvoj9d,I want you to know that Im really enjoying having this conversation and being pushed to look deeper into my beliefs. Im wondering since we keep talking about the China study what did you understand from the book? Did you read it? What would you say is an overall summary of objectivelyRegardless of your view of whether its correct or incorrect. While nothing is  full proof as science tends to ALWAYS miss something. Inherently science is flawed in that it will never paint the full picture of reality. When I see some parts rebuked I fear someone leaping to the conclusion that the full book is debunked and therefor no association between diet and disease. Have you ever tried a whole food plant based diet? A whole food plant based diet does not consume a diet of  protein and does not include casein and does not include being in a cage my full life. The study only opened Campbell up to the greater breadth of the health related chronic disease. The fact that eating a whole plant food diet that doesnt add harmful things or take away healthful parts is best for health is not new. While it does not say a  plant based diet is the only option it does help to be  in terms of willpower and commitment for health. Most people arent born vegan and therefore have a long history of over consuming animal products and a whole food plant based diet can help reverse that excess and damage. I fear that judgements on Campbells book is made without reading the book maybe thats not what youre doing but its worth a read and to make your own judgements. ,nutrition,dgvpx4x,1,t5_2qoox
