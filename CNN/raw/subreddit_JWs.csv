11104092,0,t3_5yjbqf, I dont believe there is bases for old light only future or new light. Acts  to open their eyes to turn them from darkness to light and from the authority of Satan to God so that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those sanctified by their faith in me.I have a question for you. Can you  think of any scripture or situation that condemns servants of Jehovah in the past for having wrong expectations of future events. And further can you think of any time the Governing Body has promoted anything but a waiting posture. Have they ever promoted anything based on secret revelations or have they always explained there thinking to us based on a study of the scriptures. Finally what excuse do you believe could possibly be used by the evil slave to discredit men of such good reputation who have no personal scandals like the religious leaders of Christendom. What has been used has to be inflated and publicized and explained to make it look bad like our stand on blood. Even the medical community is slowly coming around that the benifits of blood transfusions are questionable in most cases. The same With bible chronology  it only takes the questionable record keeping Babylon left for all opposers to use to discredit the seven times formula despite very fixed dating that not only established the start of the seven times but also pinpoints Jesus appearance and the end of the Jewish system under God. Even the scandal about not reporting sex offenders is blown out of proportion because until DNA even the world was helpless against this scourge since you could not prove molestations with one witness. On top of that all religions were granted ecclesiastical privlage when confessions were given and respected....until modern problems made it necessary for the authorities to revoke it on this subject and then try to go back in time and correct their  allowances of religious privilege and blaming the religion for a cover up that did not exist in most cases.,JWs,deqn0z8,2,t5_3fj0c

11106006,0,t3_5yjbqf,Ill give this a shot. But first the terms new light and old light. Those are not JW terms. Those are terms critics and ex JWs use to mock JWs. It might be that Ive always been in a Spanish congregation but those arent things I hear JWs say. However English JW terms pretty much always have their Spanish equivalent. When a teaching is clarified it is referred to as nuevo entendimiento new understanding not new light. In fact a quick search in the WOL for new light seems to confirm that this isnt what we call new understandings. Search for old light Why do you use terms that are meant to mock us? What seems to be the actual JW term is increased lightWhat the term increased light means is that current understanding is established because we now have a better understanding of certain scriptures. It isnt that the light is new or that some light was old its that now theres more light. And what was old understanding was because we as humans couldnt see clearly which is why there is now more light to correct our perception. The old understanding and new understanding arent any kind of light. There is neither new or old light. Now how does increasing light fit with the Bible? Well did Abraham know how his offspring would benefit all mankind? Did king David understand the messiah would come from his line? Did Daniel understand his visions? What about the apostle John did he understand revelation?  This shows that the concept of increased light is found within scriptures. Now what do scriptures say would happen in the last days...? gt As for you Daniel keep the words secret and seal up the book until the time of the end. Many will rove about and the true knowledge will become abundant. Daniel  So in the time of the end true knowledge will become abundant. And this would happen because many will rove about or studying looking for truth. When one is roving about for knowledge one has to adjust their view sometimes. Notice how pretty much everything that has to be revised is something to do with prophecy? Thats because prophecy is tricky and hard and you cant stick with one take on it. One always has to be ready to analyze their take on prophecy since things keep happening that just might be the fulfillment of something you thought was already fulfilled. All the main doctrines of our religion have been set since pretty much the beggining. The revisions on understanding of prophecy are necessary to properly understand prophecy. ,JWs,dequu1d,3,t5_3fj0c
11182875,0,t1_deupr6i,gtMy point in this is the one who created every atom in the universe and formed everything is so far above our intelectual potential it is ludicrous to think we can question him or his qualifications. And I would add to that  especially for the way he treats the little bit of unliving mater that he gave life too. The fact is life only exists on account of him and that is what he retains title to or franchise if you like. Saying thank you in the ways he requires to gain eternal life is not negotiable nor should it be. If you dont like the way he runs things  check out of the hotel life problem solved. LolIf god said here I am and this is what I want from you I would totally agree. Its just that things are ambiguous and given the fact that certain requirements of Jehovahs witnesses could honestly cost your life or impact it very deeply I feel like before asserting his great power qualifications and rightness of following a certain course extremely strong evidence or infallible reasoning must be put forth.,JWs,dezke1o,1,t5_3fj0c

11215280,0,t1_df2zvzd,I agree with both your posts  but I feel that askajw moderators coming over and posting all the time is a little drip drip drip of apostate point of view and I believe that to be more danger than this thread! At least the way it came out hear unveiled what their true additude is. I really am considering not participating on this one as well since I view these links to ewatch and posting of ARC as apostate propaganda propaganda that may be twisted by non believers to make it look worse than it really is! ,JWs,df38le6,2,t5_3fj0c

11444616,0,t1_dfs4ec6,do we even know if they are JW?This is internet we all have our pseudonyms we dont know what lies behind the name.and in this case the imposture is elaborate. they even have their own book.ive fast forward to the the last page in wich they insult the GB and call him stupid.Looks like a classic divide and conquer.kill the head of the organisation and the rest falls right?Surely a JW wouldnt dare to call anyone stupid.,JWs,dft8jhr,5,t5_3fj0c

11719748,0,t1_dgoe2vv,Thank you for such a comprehensive reply to an old comment!Unfortunately Im not sure that youre grasping the mathematical issues that Im referring to. Its a very common method of denying Evolution to use huge numbers to represent what amount to impossible odds but what we have to remember is that given the possibly infinite scale of the universe the numbers you quote cant be treated in the same way as they would be from a human point of view.Really it boils down to this in an potentially infinite Universe with an infinite number of particles behaving in quantum ways over . billion years those numbers do not represent impossibility.In the same way that human beings have had an artificial selective effect on wolves by turning them into dogs so the universe works. By exerting untold numbers of influences on everything from a star to a planet an animal all the way down to a particle the universe naturally selects.I do not find the argument that I should ignore the compelling evidence both mathematical and physical that the universe works in ways that we are only just beginning to comprehend to be one that is cognitively possible. I am not inclined to stick my head in the proverbial sand and to attribute things we dont understand to a book that was written by Bronze Age people. Im not going to try to shut down the Large Hadron Collider because science its done by humans.  I do not see a compelling evidentiary reasons to accept the claim that the bible is the inerrant word of a deity. Edit for the sake of clarity I do not think wolves are undomesticated dogs any more than I think humans are descended from Neanderthals... we are cousins to Neanderthal man and dogs are cousins to wolves. ,JWs,dgogn44,2,t5_3fj0c
11752323,0,t1_dg18sbv,gt This worrying about what the elders will do is totally missing that point.As with a lot of things. To me those who worry what the elders think need to work on making Jehovah more real. A lot of these sorts of questions answer themselves when you truly know who Jehovah is.,JWs,dgs5lnv,1,t5_3fj0c
11787248,0,t1_dgvs5kf,I agree with you. However he could still have a point. What if Islam is what causes them to want to end religion but they decide to start with Christianity because they figure itll be easier than getting rid of Islam. If were just speculating thats entirely possible I think ,JWs,dgw4gw8,4,t5_3fj0c
