7913392,0,t3_4mvkk5,usd  detroit  .I asked on rfountainpens and currently need help deciding between the KurutogaPentel Graph Gear  and the rotring  a bit over  but still a contenderId really rather not go above  and this is going to be for a bit of writing but mostly math What do you guys think?I will be carrying it in my pocket if that helpsand is there a dark black lead i could use ,mechanicalpencils,d45jgfg,1,t5_2tri5
7935088,0,t1_d45jgfg,Like what mostly everyone saysStaedlter     It has the nice kind heaviness to it lighter than the  obviouslyRotring   Everyone here knows how good it is but personally it will cramp your hand if you write for a really long time really fastPental Smash  Its a nice plastic pencil with a unique grip. It wont loose its grip but the grip feeling on the first day is like no other.Alvin DrafTec Retrac  Nice and cheap plastic body. Hard rubber grip. Its a lot better than all of these in the sense that it has a retractable metal tip. One drop is all it takes to bend the tips of all of these pencils and with this retractable tip you dont have to worry so much about that plus you wont hurt yourself with the tip cause it happens a lot to meKuru Toga Pipe Slide  I dont have this one but Im sure you already heard of the whole Kuro Toga rotrating thing. This one is a new model and has more rotations per revolutions. Its pretty cheap and you might notice a difference when youre writing with it.,mechanicalpencils,d47z8r1,1,t5_2tri5

8708285,0,t3_4za79w,Ive had mine for about  months worth of extensive note taking and its fantastic. Comfy if you like a heavy solid feeling with excellent control and lead advancement. The only concern with this pencil is that dropping it from around waist height will bend the lead sheath at the tip about a quarter of the time. That being said I was able to fix my bend just with my hands and it works fine now. I own quite a few other nice mechanical pencils and the rOtring is still by far my favorite. Just keep it in a safe place like a pencil pouch.,mechanicalpencils,d6u66dl,1,t5_2tri5

10501443,0,t1_dcydz6o,Fully disassembled Rotring Take a look at the first review with snapshots. It seems that white tube could be damaged. It advances the internal part of the pencil to forwardbackward. Or the spanning black detail..P.S.

10832322,0,t1_ddwxel2,Yup the Sakura Foam eraser is definitely my favorite eraser. It erases extremely well although it does leave more shavings than the average eraser. But that isnt a problem for me so I would recommend it. ,mechanicalpencils,ddxa0a7,2,t5_2tri5

11154357,0,t1_dew6pya,hmm i cant seem to choose they all have their uses. If i had to decide the ohto super promecha checks the most boxes. It has the longest lead sleeve of the collection so its precision is great for crunching in compact numbers for my accounting sheets. It also has a gravitational balance towards writing end of the pencil so there isnt much fatigue after long use of writing compared to heavier and equally balanced rotring . Also the extra adjustable customization is also great and it is also pocket safe. the only downsides of this pencil for me is that it feels very fragile.editwords,mechanicalpencils,dewc228,5,t5_2tri5
