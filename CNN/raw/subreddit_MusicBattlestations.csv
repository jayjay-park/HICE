Also can stretch the emx out to  bars and use song mode to get more of a DAW experience. Also might check your levels as analog synths can get crazy loud.

8564936,0,t3_4x3kwm,I have absolutely no idea on what she wants to try and do with this gear.  I could be missing something but Ill try to break down what I see in the pictures and how they could be used.Traktor Kontrol is a digital DJ product that combines hardware and software to allow you to mix tracks apply effects etc.  Youll need a decent computer laptop if you want to gig and a sound cardinterface.  The Yamaha MGXU is an analog channel mixer with effects.  It looks like it also comes with a stripped down version of Cubasis LE for iPad which is a DAW digital audio workstation.  I would suggest that its not really necessary if shes planning on working in the box on her computer DJing etc. Rather Id use it if I was recording multiple external instruments vocals guitars synths etc.  Headphones are aways useful.Sennheiser wireless mic kit is probably wrong.  Id suggest getting a decent mic based upon what she wants to record.  Vocals? Drums? Guitar Amp?I think  is way too much to spend on whats shown here though looking at Thomman it should be closer to .  If she wants to produce Id suggest shed be better off with something like Ableton Live Suite  Push and then pick up a decent audio interface microphone studio monitors speakers and change out the microphone to something thats better for recording.  I put together a shopping cart at Tomman and the total cost was  inc VAT.  You may be able to find a better deal if you shop around.  You may need to spend some money on a laptop or desktop if you dont have a recent machine.  ,MusicBattlestations,d6c720f,4,t5_2thwk

It really helped installing fans on the lid of the case where your normal radiators would be was previously about C before then so be sure to get something with fans on the lid or add them yourself in  minutes if youre handy.It isnt easier to steal if you screw it into your desk. A desktop PC tower is easier to steal.,MusicBattlestations,dfztxwm,1,t5_2thwk
