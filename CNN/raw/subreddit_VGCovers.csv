3123461,0,t3_2vwq0p,Definitely agree with the sennheisers suggestion especially for the price range. Im afraid youre not going to have any luck with monitors but check out headphones on amazon. Also check out AKG and Audio Technica as Swiggles suggested you can definitely find plenty of reference headphones,VGCovers,colqulx,3,t5_36ipd

9968786,0,t3_5ibr82,Submission removed with regards to our policy about remixes and remakes like this one as this remake is understandably practically  identical to the original and the only addition being a guitar solo around the  minute mark. Just changing the instrumentation and mixing it doesnt count as an eligible submission for a few reasons but the main reason is legality.Unfortunately this doesnt count as a cover. ,VGCovers,db6yjkm,1,t5_36ipd

10556693,0,t1_dd4owpf,Thanks for the video vote.   As for your review repetition is one thing that is always on mind.  EDM typically is full of songs that are filled with repetition and typically slowly build up and release throughout the song.  Im still struggling to keep things from being too repetitious though I need to work on adding more transitions.As for the pitch issue might have been because I had an automation clip on the bass and was distorting it as the song went on.  I was trying to add a sense of urgency in the latter half of the song.Thanks for the critique Ill try improving those issues next cover. ,VGCovers,dd4py2k,2,t5_36ipd

11362355,0,t1_dfjw9r2,yeah the way I see it regardless of what people do IN the video they can always optimize SEO metadata so thats why I make it part of my judgement criteria.As far as putting a sentence with the keywords first remember that on the search results page the st two lines are what shows to potential audience members...so you want that to be relevant to the video. So I always lead with something like I hope you enjoy this sax cover of Song Name from Game Title or something like that.,VGCovers,dfjwgt2,2,t5_36ipd
