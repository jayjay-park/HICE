536991,0,t3_209xqu,We didnt have AC in the freshman dorm  years ago and a fan was a cheap and effective solution. This was a similarlysized room in a concrete building with two guys in it and countless guests. A fan will give you the best benefitcost ratio over any standalone AC unit unless you live in the very pits of hell.,GoodValue,cg1b9t6,1,t5_2ue68

972807,0,t3_258f19,Husqvarna or Stihl seem to be the way to go you can buy cheaper but you will probably end up buying another in a couple of years but if you go with these two brands you will be able to have a Walt Kowalski moment in  years if you look after them.,GoodValue,chev8hk,1,t5_2ue68

2765834,0,t3_2oqe5v,I followed the Wirecutters advice for the OralB and havnt had any problems with it at all.  Only cost  and does the job well.I looked over the peerreviewed research and there is no difference between the sonic and non sonic brushes.  Additionally electric toothbrushes are only superior to manual at the gum line around  better.  My personal thought its that the builtin timers on the electric toothbrushes are why people get better results because it encourages you to brush for the correct amount of time.Nevertheless I love using an electric toothbrush because it has forced me to have better habits I dont brush too hard anymore and I brush for the correct amount of time.,GoodValue,cnigql0,2,t5_2ue68

10576199,0,t1_dd6hcwy,Honestly you shouldnt be spilling beverages on your machine so that shouldnt factor into the decision.For OP yes it sound like he already knew he wanted an old Thinkpad and was just looking for crowd confirmation. My argument is more based on the merits of each and started because a previous comment trashed chromebooks. Chromebooks ship with a SSD installed and they boot in a few seconds the exact thing you are suggesting upgrading too. If you have to travel anywhere you will quickly lament going heavy thinkpad over light Chormebook.The screens on old Thinkpads are terrible. For anyone else out there reading this I suggest going to a store and checking out a chromebook and see if you might be into it. ,GoodValue,dd6uov2,1,t5_2ue68
