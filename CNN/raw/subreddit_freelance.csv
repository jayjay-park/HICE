251779,0,t3_1wzujv,Start local to build a portfolio.  Do you know any bands or artists that need a website?

251958,0,t3_1wy7mk,I would first figure out how likely it is that you will receive the business.  A good proposal if you dont already have a template takes a bit of time to create.  This is precious unbillable time.  Depending on your comfort level with the potential client I would ask them How likely is it that I will secure the contract from you?  It does not hurt to ask and in fact a reputable company with reasonable people will not be putoff by the query.  If they do that may be a red flag.  In general concentrate your proposal on describing your work process and how it would apply to this project.  That is you requirements gathering phase mockup phase etc...how many times you iterate on each phase and approximately for how long.  Unless the project is already very well defined especially technically you will not be in a position to provide reliable time estimates in your proposal.  Add in clauses describing the typical amount of time and iterations a project like theirs may take and what factors influence these efforts.  When it comes to pricing offer ranges in place of a single number.Proposals can be very tricky.  If you go all out and come up with ideas and mockups for the proposal then you are doing free work without guarantee of an upside.  How would you feel if they chose another vendor and the client had your ideas?  Id wager not so well.  Again the above applies mostly for proposals on projects that require a lot of requirements discovery and gathering.  It is also very easy to spend a lot of time writing proposals for projects that they never intended to give you in the first place.,freelance,cf6vbq0,1,t5_2qhs9

1322351,0,t3_298758,Hey I think its really cool youre trying to get some work at your age. Ill see if I can give you some tips.You should set your expectations low. Youre probably gonna get more cash just working a normal summer job. What Id suggest is finding friends or family who want somehing you can deliver and do it for free. Say a website. This way you are networking creating work for your resume gaining experience in communication creating professional references  a future client can call your past clients to ask about you  and you can ignore as much documentation fluff as you like. If you feel your experience or situation doesnt allow for you to finish it its fine. I am sure they will pay you some money for it in the end but dont ask for it or expect it.Basically you have to understand that you need to create a kind of brand but you are starting with basically nothing. So even if you earn  USD you should be happy because it shows at least someone is interested in your brand.It reminds me of when I started working in Second Life. My partner and I were trying to make money there and worked out butts off for months. We tried everything but nothing worked. At one point we sold this object and all the rights to it for  USD. It was about  long mandays of work! So thats about  cents an hour. But I tell you we were so happy about it. One of the best feelings ever! About  years later we were paid about  USD per day and a few more years later  USD per day.Of course that included getting experience but it was mostly the brand we had built which stood for quality reliability etc.,freelance,ciidqod,1,t5_2qhs9

So yes forever. I dont think it becomes unreasonable as the contract goes longer. They deserve to get paid more for finding you  months of worth versus  month. Theres a buyout clause in their client agreement that the company can hire you fulltime if they want to for a fee often waived after  months. So if you arent hired after  months its probably because they like the arrangement they have with the recruiting agency for whatever reason. ,freelance,cj4dd0h,1,t5_2qhs9

They pay on time and pretty well and more or less let me call the shots.The problem? Every time I pitch a design his partner goes out and finds a free alternative. It would be terribly insulting if it werent hilarious.This week for instance they asked me to redesign their business cards. Great they were a bit dated and could use a refresh. I redesign the card and send out the draft. Everyone agrees its good and I create proofs for each person to review their information before printing its a four person company so this is feasible. Literally two minutes later I get an email asking if I can drop the logo onto a vista print template so he can do it himself. At this point I get my contact on the phone he tells me to proceed as planned and we order the cards. This is my process every time. I get paid and move on and we repeat the process next week ad nauseam.

Youve also established this bottom line in which you will constantly be fighting with your clients at  you will try to do less work and they will push you for more.  You will be miserable and you will do halfassed work because youll realize that  is not a lot of money.edit  youll also get shitty clients who think  is what you should pay for a website.  Theres a reason why web devs still charge a lot of money to do basic wordpress stuff.I would suggest going the other way  charge topline pricing and let that dictate your workload.   As a professional set your work schedule up front with the client.  If you can be available for conversation during their working time but make sure they know when you will do the work.  In the end the client wants to know hes getting service for the money.  Hit your deadlines.

3567421,0,t1_cpyrr1s,Thanks for your personal feedback I really appreciate that!Im still working for my last employer. In the meantime Ive reached out to old colleagues that are now working in other companies and I tried to find work there. Those attempts were successful but I couldnt follow up on them because the current project took longer than expected. A former colleague is currently working as a recruiter and has reached out to me. If I need work in the near future Ill let this recruiter do sales for me and reach out to my network again. Im still hoping to get some traction by word of mouth and may skip the hunt on platforms like freelancer or oDesk.As youve pointed out Im currently struggling with the decision to professionalize my freelancer career or to do product development. Luckily the last project has opened some product opportunities that Id like to follow up on in the next months. A minimal viable product isnt that far away and according to my original line of thought thats the freedom that I wanted recurring revenues via software licenses. Im still trying to find my growth engine with a software product that fills a certain need and I see freelancing as a vehicle to get insights into the pain certain industries or businesses are experiencing.My location in Stuttgart and the short driving distance to a lot of companies has been proven worthy so far. During the starting phase I reached out to a lot of people and met them for breakfast lunch or dinner. Im always surprised how many IT companies are located in this region. With the strong automotive industry and its supply chain Im not expecting that the region runs out of work for a software engineer soon. The local startup community is assessable and supportive as well.If I continue to work from home or not depends on the clients preferences. Actually I like being onsite as it helps me to keep my discipline but theres still the tradeoff with the commute.The transition to business consultant or industry expert is certainly on my list. Im trying to position myself as a trusted advisor for the public sector and provide eGovernment products and services. Defining your ideal client definitely helps. The question one should ask though Am I able to get enough revenues from my ideal customer segment at the moment? Im currently not in a position to decline a good offer for contract work from an industry client. Hopefully with some recurring revenues through products Im able to decline offers and further specialize in the public sector.Its always nice to see someone experiencing a similar situation  so best of luck for you too ,freelance,cpywv5a,1,t5_2qhs9

3725243,0,t1_cqgvqyo,gt Do you have k to spend on this project? If you dont I wouldnt touch it. From what I gathered you are using an outside contractor who is going to charge k for a k job. Leaving no room for any kind of error without costing you money. I dont think it would be a good use of capital or time to be honest. If something goes wrong and things do go wrong you will end up on the hook. You dont need to take those risks if you cannot write the check to clear them up. I could spend k if I absolutely had to. I will obviously pin down actual figures before starting. Would adding  to the contractors estimate when creating a budget be wise in this case? That way Id have  safety room  my funds.Also this is just the first serious contractor Ive talked with Im obviously not going to jump on board until I hear other opinions. There may be much much cheaper options.gt But I will lower the rate to secure the development being paid for by someone else. I also make it known that because we are lowering our rate we are retaining the rights to the module they are getting a license. The reason is simply I am taking a bet that we can make more off of the module through selling it than we can make on a one off job. If they decline and want the rights we just charge them full price and go on with it. Sounds like what I want to do.gt What happens if a milestone is met and the client suddenly bails? Can you pay the contractor and move along like normal? Yes I would never intentionally screw a fellow contractor over as a contractor myself. Its completely unfair to pass the buck.gt Also to sum up I wouldnt ever charge based on value added. Its a poor metric to charge on and does not translate into much. Charge based on your hours or your flat fee. Value added charging is generally trying to rip someone off. Plus the value is never as high as you might think it is. Im not sure how else to price it though. If I want to increase the clients output lets say  through this solution I can quantify the value of that. Plugging in some numbers if my costs are indeed going to be k and I make kmo in other revenue over the long term I already have a year history with this client and I can resell the solution what would you you charge? In the future how do I price the solution thats mostly complete if I dont sell on value?,freelance,cqgwivl,1,t5_2qhs9

4356035,0,t3_39x2yb,So I tend to look at it this way.  I do not charge for estimation and earlystage consultation.  This is to me a necessary evil in order to land the job.   I do start charging for the key phases of my smaller projects  Define This is a further more in depth process of getting requirements and functionality documentation.  Typically I produce wireframes and documentation for signoff.  Its also clear in my early estimate discussion with them that scope and prices may change as a result of this process.  Dont leave that last bit out! It will save your sanity more than once.  Design.  Here I produce photoshop mocks of the site.  For sign off and approval.  At this point there should be no surprises but its also not uncommon for scope and price to change as a result here too. Development.  This is where I actually build whats in scope and whats been designed. Deployment.  This final stage is for promotion to production and any training and documentation or code handover is done. I also charge  for each phase and again its clear from the very beginning where scope can creep and were extra charges can accrue.So to simply answer your question no I dont charge for discussions prior to landing the job but because Im careful and communicative throughout the process I dont worry too much about getting all the scope perfectly clear before we begin.  and fyi Ive never over charged more than about  so its not like I blindly say yes to everything and then screw them with overcharges in the middle of a project. For smaller projects Ill define a fixed price for larger projects I work hourly.,freelance,csgnpc4,1,t5_2qhs9
4379683,0,t3_3b5ul2,There are many ways to determine time but the Cocomo model is a widely used technique for accurately determining time and costs of a project. You should find a online course on how to do it. The time of the project is also going to be determined by what development methodology you use Agile Information Engineering Rational Unified Process Extreme Programming Rapid Application Development etc changes to the requirements  scope may lead to project running late and depending on your development methodology it may require a substantial amount of additional time.    Most IT projects fail due to a lack of planning communication and not understanding the requirements and scope. You should state the scope requirements and deliverables of the project. Before you start to work you should set out a work break down structure or pert chart or some way to determine milestones in your project. With most IT projects component A needs to be done before component B can work and component D cant work until both AampB work etc. You need to keep this in mind.You should tell the client where you are and any problems or set backs that you have experienced communication is very important here if the project runs late you can go back and have something to show for your work. You need to communicate communicate communicate!!    Labour and hardware should always be separated variable and fixed costs should never be combined there are a few exceptions but this is a general rule. You need to be careful here some countries have very strict rules regarding tax on this issue. If you include it in your hourly rate you will have to pay tax as it is income whereas if you separate it you could pay less tax many countries for example have tax rebates for fuel. This is why most companies separate hourly costs from transport accommodation etc. It will also look strange if your hourly cost is constantly changing.,freelance,csjbq5k,1,t5_2qhs9

5189703,0,t1_cvbjcdk,As someone who hires a lot on those sites and has also gotten a lot of freelance work there I personally dont want to see aggressive CTAs like that from a freelancer. What a lot of freelancers just plain dont understand about sites like Elance and Upwork is that youre initiating a sales funnel. Like all sales funnels you dont want to try to close the deal before theyre ready to buy from you. Scheduling a kickoff meeting before youre even hired seems pushy and presumptuous. Pushing for any meeting when the buyer has  other bids to go through is actually pretty annoying and onerous. Tell the buyer who you are and what you do sell them on why youre the best fit for their needs and budget then leave a casual CTA letting them know that IF theyre interested you want to continue the conversation. If they want to contact you after that they can. I dont even like leaving more than one question  none if possible  it often seems like the shameless ploy to get a reply that it is and it makes the buyer feel like you think theyre obligated to engage with you which is not true and again presumptuous and annoying. Just think of your bid as a landing page for your sales funnel and in service providers case that SCHEDULE A MEETING RIGHT THE EFF NOW!!!! tactic before theyre even convinced youre a good fit for the job almost never works.Bids and cover letters are soft sells for prospects not closing the deal.

Stating my prices up front may weed out real bottom feeders but it doesnt weed out hagglers and actually gives them a starting point  oh you charge X for Y service? I have XYZ special circumstance! Would you be willing to do it for X for my special snowflake self? No thank you.. Every project is different and many clients have absolutely no idea what their projects entail to begin with. For example if I say I charge  for a page website I will invariably get someone saying Does that mean you charge  per page? My website only needs TWO pages the home page plus my online catalog of  products that needs  different special features and an SSL certificate integrated with a payment gateway that only works in Papua New Guinea. You can put it all on one page! See! Two pages! Youll do that for  right? . Im charging for a service and for my expertise not an end product. Putting my prices on my page encourages people to view my business as me selling a product the end resultwebsite when thats just not the case. YMMV.

Its a hugely competitive area and while you can get work from such sites my own opinion is that you should build up your own client base and not rely on any third parties. What I will say to you is that you need a case study how has your content helped a business did it increase their sales did it attract more people to their website. So writing a few pieces for free but make sure you are able to get information out of them on the results and also good testimonials. Then when you have a portfolio with case studiestestimonials to back them up you will have more luck approaching people. The fact is you dont appear to be in a rush to make the extra income so take your time to plan look at what you can offer and how you can add value and dont waste your time fighting for scraps on freelance sites. ,freelance,cwtyoq8,2,t5_2qhs9

Though I really have to argue with several points as being either bad or downright hindering.gtDo not waste time on setting up a local dev environment. Ive tried it all and can say with confidence that a cheap VPS is the best way to control your environment so that it is very close to the live site environment.No.  Just I cant even think of anything to express the level of wrong this advice is.  Just no.  ALWAYS setup a local dev environment.  This serves several purposes.  One you dont pay per hourmonthgb on your local computer so it saves you money versus a VPS.   Two it is good practice and is honestly considered to be a best practice for development to always have a local dev environment.  I would seriously look into learning how to if not setup a LAMPWAMPetc environment then at least learn how to configure and deploy vagrant boxes to have a quick and easily repeatable amp configurable dev environment.  Finally it teaches you how to configure and how an actual live production environment works by replicating the system locally within a virtualized container that you can reformatdeletescrew uplearn from.gtDo not agree to set up a customer portal with login capabilities. Do not agree to put together a site with a fully featured design your own tshirt tool. While possible with Wordpress know your limits. Again this is bordering on criminally wrong advice.  Yes you should know your limits.  However you should not be afraid to experiment to put yourself out there to take jobs that are going to test you and your knowledge and force you to improve.  Some of the best learning experiences and greatest teachers are those jobs where you end up going Oh god what did I sign myself up for.  They force you to learn grow and expand as its either adapt or die professionally not physically.   Now Im not saying rush out and sign up for the first thing you find that you know you obviously cant do.  But Im also not saying to never test yourself and push your professional boundaries by always playing it safe and only taking the simple mindless drudge crap that doesnt teach you anything.

5873332,0,t3_3vgkf2,Glad youre asking questions at the critical moment instead of too late. The number one reason why freelancers fail IMHO is because they focus entirely on their work and neglect their business. Mediocre skill and good business sense will get you way further than talent and poor business sense.You and millions of others want to write. So youre going to have to differentiate yourself. What do you specialize in? If youre not sure think about what people turn to you for. Now sincerely consider whether thats a viable niche. Every something wants to be a travel writer consequently its super hard to get into that field with so much competition. Meanwhile while there might be a more limited audience perhaps theres unmet demand for articles about a niche type of travel such as birdwatching.There are two directions you can go  write for yourself and monetize or  write for others and sell your articles If youre going alone youre going to need a solid business plan. First youre going to have to build a readership. This is going to take lots of time and effort. Network guest post use social media engage readers and write content for them. Second you need income streams. Unless you have tens of thousands of hits per month advertising isnt going to be viable. Consider affiliate programs or directly selling items you sincerely recommend. For example my uncle blogs about whiskey so I suggested he sell whiskey accessories like glasses and stones. Honestly and sincerity are key. If youre selling content directly you need to determine who needs your content and how much is it worth to them. Before you pick up the phone you need to know your prices how much is your time worth? If youre not sure a good starting point is figuring how much you make per hour at your day job and doubling that. If you live in a developed country I think anything less than hour freelancing is a waste of time. Lets say you decide  for an article is the minimum youd accept. If a client refuses to meet this you walk away. No working for exposure BS. Do not rationalize that because youre new you deserve less.Now you need to sell. Dont think for a second that your work speaks for itself. You need to figure out what the clients problemdemandneed is and figure out how your writing solves it. This can only be done by talking to someone. Pitch ideas and explain how theyre going to solve the clients problem. For example you get a hold of an editor for a website and find out that theyre having trouble breaking into X demographic. Ask them if theyd be interested in hearing some ideas for content that could help get readers in that demographic. Then do some research and make a pitch. ,freelance,cxpixhx,2,t5_2qhs9

6016739,0,t3_3xuu9o,I highly do NOT recommend Pancake. Its missing major features horrible usabilitydata structure and more buggy than an african safari. It is also slow slow slow. I have reseller hosting and all my sites run fine except Pancake. Either hangs or times out almost every time I use it. Server Errors galore. One example of usability issues that seems minor at first but is just indicative of how the whole is built Recurring invoices. It seems like recurring invoices are created at the first instance on creation or just after the previous year has been sent. That means that recurring invoices are marked as unpaid throughout the year long before they have even been sent out with a future due date. There is no way to filter them than out. So they are just sitting in your accounts receivables screwing up the numbers all year long. As far as I can tell you cant filter by date either for me they are always at the top of the list. I used Harvest previously. Its not bad and I have no real complaints against it. I switched because I wanted a one time fee and a self hosted option that I could expand upon. I have yet to cancel my harvest account because well I still might go back. Just having trouble accepting that I wasted my money on Pancake and exporting is going to be a shitshow. I manually imported most of my data when I imported into Pancake.  Ive put in the effort to style it out and dug into the code a bit considering making a plugin to fix some of the issues but thats just a lot more time wasted. And in regards to support its not great. Once they get your money their normal turn around time is a few days even weeks sometimes. The last few issues they never even responded. I currently cannot update Pancake because of some sort of bug and Im tired of asking them for help. I suspect the pancake devs are redditors so this will probably be downvoted...

Would you pay year to be able to share your stories with other freelancers?  This would keep out casual clients none of it would be public or indexable by search engines and people would be able to let their hair down a bit more.As others have said though theres  sides to every story but when I read email threads I tend to get a sense of how in the right the aggrieved party actually is.  That said Im not sure how useful the process would be even if consolidated to a particular country because almost no one is ever competing for the same work and theres an extremely low chance my previous clients would ever become your clients.What may be better is Im considering doing work with person XYZ or company ABC  who has previous experience with this outfit? then conducting more or less onetoone PMs with folks.But it should all be private and there should be some nominal fee to keep others out.,freelance,cyrr9af,1,t5_2qhs9

6699511,0,t3_47bv92,I think under UK law you may already be operating as a partnership you dont have to formally declare it with HMRC or anything even if you have other formal or informal agreements about what each partners responsibilities are and so on. I believe one common partnership test used is how you share out expenses. Say you get  in as a collective and spent  on materials  does Bob who spent the  get this back first before the profit is shared out  or do you effectively take the  loss as a group before splitting profits? In the first case you are all independent but the second you are working as a partnership. Maybe I have explained that badly but the main point is  you can be seen to be in a legal partnership without having formally agreed anything.You generate income together but pay tax separately and someone also has to submit this information in a similar way as a selfassessment for the partnership as a whole. If this is working for you then aside from one of you deciding to be the lead partner to declare your total income to HMRC there shouldnt be much more to do. Dont worry there is some extra paperwork but much less than setting up an LLP or limited companyThe next step would likely be a limited liability partnership which has a legal identity of its own or perhaps even a coop if you are that way inclined. The main risk at the moment is that when problems occur you as a partner are equally liable as whichever other partner caused the problem. Say a partner agrees to a huge project way beyond your capacity or buys a load of stock that fails they get cold feet and do a runner  whoever was promised this project now wants to sue the remaining partners for the loss. A lot of trust is involved! This can still happen in a limited liability partnership but you have more protection over your personal assets. A company limited by guarantee could achieve a fairly similar thing providing you werent planning on greatly expanding the group of partners who would then mostly likely be directors with equal shares.This is word a read ,freelance,d0cacue,2,t5_2qhs9

6808557,0,t3_48y3n3,So much of your hourly rate depends on your speed experience and so on. For example with my freelance I work very quickly and in web projects I have a little over a decade of experience working as a freelancer. So my hourly rate is steep.The lowest Ive seen for a competent midlevel developer in freelance was USD hour. When you factor in taxes healthcare and other benefits that arent being provided by an employer that works out to something like a kyear salary.More senior devs are anywhere from hour and up.Definitely do the math for your own former salary. Add in employment taxes. Benefits. Vacation. All that. Then assume that youll probably only fill  of your hours reliably. And from there youll know what your hourly rate needs to be if you want to maintain your current standard of living.Being a freelancer is expensive so the hourly probably needs to be a lot higher than most new freelancers feel comfortable asking for. But remember that higher hourly is just to keep you at an identical level of income to your previous job.Freelancing is hard enough without taking a paycut. Good luck!,freelance,d0o1ol2,2,t5_2qhs9

7166831,0,t3_4dc2ku,Third Worlder here.Ive been using UpWork for the past  months and yes its true it gave me an income I could never achieve in my country otherwise. However Im done with being exploited. A few experiences of mine. My first client wanted me to proofread something in Spanish. After delivering it I checked her profile and saw that she was an EnglishSpanish translator and proofreader with an hourly rate of around UD... but she got it all done from me for UD. I have no idea of how many First World contractors do this but Id dare to say its slightly offensive.. A European client set daily deadlines for two articles each. I told him to give me at least a couple of days he apologized and agreed but continued doing the same for weeks.One day out of nowhere he said he needed  articles in  hours. I told him he was being absolutely unrealistic and that all Id manage to do would be only bases for  and I actually managed to do it.. Another First Worlder was so delighted that he wanted to hire me as a chief editor for his startup media... for UD a month.I was supposed to write only a couple of articles per week and also correct the ones by his associate. According to him I didnt have to write anything at all in those since Id only have to make sure his associates articles were properly optimized for search engines.The thing is... his associate used to write one or two lines embed around four lowquality and uncredited images and call it an article so that meant I had to entirely rewrite those from scratch too for UD each which I found insulting mostly because he was taking me for a fool.Also he expected me to feel grateful as if he was doing me a favor or something try offering that payment to a First World professional and let me know how it goes!. Additionally he tried to get away from all the extra design and editorial work I had done so I had to send him screen captures of his messages to expose him and he ended up paying what he said he would.. More recently yet another First Worlder hired me on an hourly contract and now he expects me to come up with one article per hour for UD. He seems to consider nine hours dedicated to three articles full with infographics and cover images designed by me is simply too long... so Im trying to gracefully walk away from this one.Also Ive seen plenty of plagiarized contractor profiles and Ive recently learned that there are sites online dedicated exclusively to publishing the answers to UpWorks tests. So thats how so many clearly unqualified contractors get remarkable scores...My conclusions UW freelancers tend to be Third World modern slaves while UW clients tend to be First World modern slavers.They totally complement each other. Its become a system that works perfectly but I simply want out because Im a professional and I know I can do much better than that. Ive learned so much though that Im lost for words at this point.The most important lesson Ive learned so far distrust the flatterer type of client because they just want to offer you an insulting payment and make it sound as if it was the best thing that could happen to you.Bonus track a potential client First Worlder too wanted two daily articles and social media management services for UD per month because thats a lot of money in some countries. I told him I saw myself forced to decline his proposal because that would represent around UD per article at a rate of one cent per word and... well the social media management would have been left to be done completely as charity.Nope.,freelance,d1ssu22,7,t5_2qhs9

Considering freelance work isnt regular income you can never be sure of the next project.When a client says social network in  dollars they think they will get a Facebook. The developer thinks they would install a free open source cmssocial network and be done with that. Its not a communication issue here. Most people giving out such projects arent realistic. They most likely have no clue how to go about implementing a project or the questions one should ask a developer before finalizing a project. Few times I tried bidding I find the buyer unwilling to answer too many questions or get into details. It seems to me that they want to finalize a seller and then discuss detailed requirements.We make better money in the local market  India  than the pricing seen on these freelancing websites. ,freelance,d21kf8a,3,t5_2qhs9

Im working on a project manager now for myself primarily as Ive got ideas all over the place. I dont use WordPress at all so I know very little about it. Ive been told or have read that it is money that is there as in a lot of people use WordPress and so there is business to be had there. I was trying at UpWork for a little bit but Ive found that a lot of the jobs are not what I know about. Magento shopping carts I havent worked with either of those. There was a question on domain mapping with wordpress and I was messing with that a year or two ago because I wasnt aware that VirtualHosts did that so thats what I use now.Truth be toldwhat? I am subscribed to GizMag and they send out an email like twice or more a week and I open that up and look through see an interesting article go to their site.

7375155,0,t1_d2ggz4o,Initial proviso I have worked exclusively with web applications that is a web site that typically has a lot of functionality rather than just displaying data to the user. Experience for a frontend dev who has worked in say ecommerce will vary massively.Languages mostly means some variant of JavaScript for me. That could be ESES ES TypeScript CoffeeScript becoming less commonIts the only language that the browser knows if you dont include things like Adobe Flash so its all you really need. Youll probably want to look into SCSSLESS as well and that covers pretty much all of your bases.The real knowledge comes from experience with specific frameworks or methodologies. Most people can pick up JavaScript pretty quickly becoming competent with it can take a good while and most people learn with a certain set of other technologies. In my current place Im using React frontend framework SCSS CSS precompiler Flux not really a package but a methodology that has some standard libraries to back it up Webpack build tool mostly for bundling source files into compact bundles Gulp build tool Babel ES gt ES transpiler if its already set up you dont need to know much about it but knowing where it fits is hugely usefulAll of this except for SCSS is some variant of JavaScript whether that be as simple as JSON for configuring the tools or fullon application logic.Other ones of note jQuery dying out a bit but still used in a huge number of legacy applications BackboneMarionette dataoriented frameworks Backbone on its own is dying out but Marionette still seems fairly common Angular .x a huge number of places are still using this though not many new applications are being started with it Meteor no experience of this myself but as far as I can tell its just another framework for building web applicationsHope that helps.TLDR JavaScript and variants thereof and SCSS. Learn some frameworks and standard tools too like React Webpack Gulp.,freelance,d2gi59n,3,t5_2qhs9

8049291,0,t3_4pgvxr,gt I can do fullstack web devgtaround  dollars a monthI am full stack like you  some specialised expertise and I made .K this week only one thing really had anything to do with my field.It takes hard work and you mostly need to learn to hear what people are saying they want in the final result when they often dont know where to begin themselves besides hiring you to answer these questions. Listen to their goal and then repeat back to them how youre going to achieve it and how what youre doing will get them that end result they might not even have said what this is you must use your empathy to try and hear what they want within their plansMy general advice is be confident and take a bite of more than you can chew at first. You wont get paid what you deserve to figure some stuff out. Most good web applications cost K from a firm to be completed in a month youll be getting closer to K to complete it in the same amount of time from some clients you talk to. If youre not ready to spread yourself thin sometimes then you might want to hire someone and split pay I did this one time early on. This advice is unnecessary for a graphic designer etc. but not for you and I. Its what is known as subcontracting and it comes in handy. Build a network of fellow professionals who can help out because youre just one person competing with the quality of full teams. Average people dont know the difference and youll simply be paid less in most cases. Not bad pay but not great for the time frames you may be looking at.As a beginner I made a certain mistake Id like to share with you when it comes to full stack development do not undervalue your time and work. Charge what you think you should charge and its likely not a bad idea to top it off with  more because of a rule of thumb. Last piece of advice and its the fun part of freelanceIf you have a portfolio of fullstack web applications that you did essentially on your own? You can get a job almost anywhere. Ive been in recruiting sessions with leading companies because of X project from my little portfolio. At the time it was something to pay the bills it becomes much more to people who walk into your life with opportunity. Keep track of your projects and freelance is like the gym. You have to push yourself a little further each time in order to grow. If you just want to make money take any and all gigs youre capable of doing. If you want to grow and develop as a coder and solution engineer so to speak then take on the challenging ones. Like I said you can always subcontract. Thats not lazy or irresponsible its a part of your job. In the meantime with something like that look up the subject you didnt understand while you subcontract it so that next time youre the one making  of the profit because you continue to take in new understandings.Finding clients rforhire this sub rjobsforbitcoins rfreelanceforhire etc. Youll pick up on these and subscribe as you go if you care enough and I guess that brings up one last piece of advice from meYou have to find your own jobs and part of that has nothing to do with being a fullstack coder but has to do with marketing yourself and finding needs that can be met. These exist everywhere. My breaks are not because I cant find work theyre because I have too much of it and its too easy for me to get sucked up finding more of it.,freelance,d4ktdmy,12,t5_2qhs9

It might be a good idea to seek written assurance right away that they are not proposing to do so because if they are unwilling to provide such assurance then that would leave you in pretty good shape with regards to whether you had any further obligations.If you know that you wont be finishing the project on the other hand you have a duty to tell them that sooner rather than later.  I would suggest writing them a nice letter on paper detailing The difference between what you undertook to do and what they now want you to do with as much reference the available documentation as possible. That you cannot perform the work that would be required to achieve their goals.   That you believe that your previous work is unlikely in your opinion to have caused the problems that they are experiencing  that you were diligent in performing it  that it could not have been reasonably expected to cause problems   that beyond that the nature of software very much limits the warranties that can be associated with it. Quantify the amount of work you have already done on the project. Say that you cannot foresee any other course for you the parties to take than to dissolve the contract. Say that you believe that your performance to date justifies the retention of the deposit.,freelance,d4ytgyp,2,t5_2qhs9

The solution really might be to just charge a lot more. Try not to care what the cost to the client is and then youll never feel like YOUVE been railroaded.  Im saying this but I have to follow these exact same recommendations myself. Youre probably a good freelancer its just dialing in how to make a bunch of money and be worth it and awesome where its rewarding. Think of this. You can always give more money back later on if you wanted. If somebody agrees to a price and you think its high i mean oh well. To them its worth it.  But if you felt guilty about charging too much you can give back. its really hard to get more when you charge too little. The expectation is EVERYTHING in business.

The minimum pay you should be aiming to make is as much money as you need to make no need to be a guessed number because you should understand your expenses pretty well. I will share my own equation for figuring out my minium price.My minimum price was a total of all expenses savings and luxuries I wanted to keep. I also took into account a portion almost  for me needed to go towards taxes. So I had to have a higher yearly income to keep the needed income when subtracting . I didnt guess. I went through all my expenses savings I wanted and luxuries then made sure everything was extrapolated over a year. Then of course divide by  and youd have your monthly goal. Having that exact number is useful because then you can figure out how much you need to charge each client. I charge per project but the price is based off an hourly rate. So I figured out how many hours I wanted to work each month and used my monthly income goals to figure out my minimum hourly rate. Then I use that to influence how I price a client project. My exact equation is as suchgtHours Job Would Take  Min Rate  Min PricegtMin Price  Min Price  Percentage Markup that Client Will Agree To  Final Price,freelance,d8hrczx,1,t5_2qhs9

9629890,0,t1_d9z1l55,Definitely agree. Im used to constantly having to reinforce my expertise by breaking down concepts into laymans terms. Here was my responseYou are right about inactivity being a big factor which is why I proposed a content strategy from here on out. While there might be some manual review process that Google uses Googles ranking algorithm is used to determine where a website ranks for certain Google searches. Your website has to actually rank for those keyword searches first before it is manually reviewed by an employee. If you rank in the top  pages on Google for a search term like red bags Google might have an employee manually review the website to determine if the website deserves the page rank. To actually get to the manual review portion automated methods are used first. Ive detailed these factors in previous emails but a few of them are. Is the website mobile friendly? If so your website might rank higher when compared to nonmobile friendly websites. Google wants websites that offer the best user experience and are the most useful to people that use their search engine.. Is the website actively updated and maintained? An active website is preferred because new wellresearched information is preferable to old potentially outdated information. Google wants website owners to display the best highquality content to users.. Is your website secured? Does it use HTTPS to encrypt web traffic? Google prefers that their users see websites that are secure. It reflects badly on Google to direct their users to websites that could potentially harm them! So they want secure websites ranked higher.. Do other people talk about your website backlinks? Google uses backlinks as a way to infer the quality and relevancy of information on your website. If other fashion blogs constantly link to your products then Google assumes that it is an authority website in the fashion website space. Google also uses this social signal to infer that the products are popular. This can boost your page rank.Just to clarify what I mean by keywords When a person searches colorful shoes on Google we want your website to rank better for that keyword search. Users might search for shoes or red striped shoes. There are hundreds of keyword combinations that people use. However some are more competitive than the others and are much harder to rank for.For instance the search term shoes has millions of search results websites that rank for that keyword. Alternatively the search term red striped shoes has only hundreds of thousands of search results. Furthermore the websites that rank in the top  pages for shoes will be very difficult to outrank because the keyword search is extremely competitive. The websites in the top  pages are incredibly good and have high page authority. The chances of ranking for this keyword are very low.However if we target red striped shoes there is a good chance that we can rank for this search due to the lower competition.So when I go to optimize the website content the keyword strategy is essential to setting the website up to rank for keywords related to what you sell and talk about. We want all the articles products and pages on the website to increase the chances of ranking for keyword searches related to the brand. I hope this helped explain some of the SEO concepts a little bit better.,freelance,da02yh3,2,t5_2qhs9

With little progress made toward resolving those issues and a tense conversation about unpaid invoices last week that didnt lead to any invoices paid he would be a fool to think things are peachy.gt to give his blessing to you taking over his client directly rather then running the existing relationship into the ground.I know enough about his financial situation that he wont willingly give me that client. I expect he is practically living off their retainer one they wouldve cancelled if Id stopped working earlier this year like most people wouldve. Plus that client in his portfolio is a huge selling point for him. That wont happen unfortunately. ,freelance,dblj40g,3,t5_2qhs9

10296658,0,t3_5nfoz7,Ive found when working for friends or even good acquaintances I felt very awkward charging my regular rate and would often discount it for them subconsciously. That made me feel undervalued when I actually went to do the work. Also it was hard for me to follow up on invoices if they were late in paying.

Document that youve given him  of the source code.Give him a perfect out... let him hire someone else.  If he cares to have the work done he shouldnt care WHO does that work.  He can find  Web Devs on UpWork happy to help him.I had a client stop payment on an over the counter software product that I special ordered for him.

11098892,0,t1_deq0yrr,Theres two categories of liability shift. Counterfeit liability shift Visa MC AmEx Discover liability goes to the store if they cant accept the chip at all.. Loststolen liability shift MC AmEx Discover liability goes to the store if the chip is used the card prefers PIN over signature iandi if the store cant or doesnt get the PIN from the customer.In practice stores only really have to worry about . For one thing the vast majority of American cards prefer signature over PIN. Visa cards in particular are almost always chip and signature in the US too and Visa isnt shifting liability for PIN preferring cards.Even if both of those werent true though most terminals will ask for the PIN if running a PINpreferring card. The only merchants that probably really need to worry about  would be the ones using Square readers and the like in tourist areas since those dont have any physical PIN pads at all.,freelance,deq1swt,1,t5_2qhs9

11188705,0,t1_df07zy4,Yup. Im not a freelancer but my company provides apps. We make it clear to our clients that apps are going to be more expensive than their website more than likely and theyre made to solve problems. If your problem is that youre not getting enough customers thats a marketing issue and an app isnt going to solve that so lets talk about how we can drum up business for you.I personally would approach prospective clients about a website before I would ever talk to them about an app.. Its a LOT easier to get your foot in the door about a website or marketing than it is an app. The issue with approaching them about an app is that it requires the need to learn more about their business and their needs..

11437904,0,t3_632i0x,Ive had this too for about  years now and  of those years I spent working at an office supply retailer as a technology sales and computer technician. When it comes to meeting people in real life and talking about stuff I have absolutely zero issues even if its a difficult client. But emails and phone calls are entirely different for some reason.I would have to contact people to get more information about their computer problems because no one really knew what to ask when booking in a repair and I hated doing that. Calling to tell them its ready for pickup is easy. People would automatically assume I was calling to say its ready and I was afraid theyd be mad it wasnt and I was calling to get more info. Always felt like I was the bad guy. Then I became cynical and feel better talking to people on the phone.Criticism over email doesnt bother me  I know how to either counter it or learn from it to do better next time. Its the emails to clients to get more content or let them know how the project is coming along that really get to me. Sometimes Ill simply delay replying to them because Im afraid theyll be mad or upset over a minor delay or something... Just need to remember that bad news is still better than no news at all unless its a really bad client. ,freelance,dfsh4l1,1,t5_2qhs9

If things happened in the process or if the client is reasonable it is fair to ask for more money.
