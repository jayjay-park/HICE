5288682,0,t3_3mzif8,..i dont see what the fuzz is about here. They are allowing the fetish perspective to be heard and ive seen people talk about MEF over there countless of times.

5623493,0,t1_cwu3zty,We are not talking about rational experiences here.. Rather a result of fault in biology as in having a female copulatory mind in a male body. Remember i use the term sex dysphoria and not gender.One can rationalize identity or the feelings of pain but that doesnt exclude them from their origin. Pain is still a reaction from the brain delivered by nerves and you can still have a body amp sex mismatch without identifying with the gender roles of your birth sex.. Its not wrong presenting gender as an essence but its not all that trivial..,MEFetishism,cwu5c1m,1,t5_36x7u

5936971,0,t1_cxxi5ql,gtBecause is it not required for the masochism to be recognisable for the person for it to be arousing as described by my example above. But in order to realize something it has to be apparent in a sensible way.. again if you dont feel it how do you presume it is something like masochism? Because someone else tells you it makes sense?gtAgain lets take a person with foot fetish for example many dont even know why they are aroused to it let alone point out a specific element out if it. Yet they are aroused to it. All they know foot is arousing its like automatic.I dont see how a foot fetish would be parallel to a masochistic fetish.. Maybe as in the case with crossgender fantasies SOME like to view it in a masochistic context but that alone doesnt make it rooted in masochism. gtthis fetish could be very well be inheritedAre you talking about masochistic imprints or any arousals because i usually see them as separate?In any case someone could also claim the love or arousal towards feminity is inherited instead of the masochism. It doesnt validate either claims.gtThis analogy doesnt quite follow.Dont want to seem too rude but some people here seem like religious people whom are saying theyve seen the light and have rationalized their whole life around MEF and finding masochistic elements supporting it when there are s of alternative explanations available. But anyone not believing there is a god or trying to prove something as more scientific is wrong..Im not against any religion either whatever makes someone happy if what matters.. However some people here are of the preaching kinds...,MEFetishism,cxxv8g7,1,t5_36x7u
5945312,0,t1_cxyxtbf,gtBecause all of this fantasy contains masochism element in it and masochism can be arousing. There are good argumentreasoning on why masochism can be arousing. But we are not talking about just masochistic elements but about all similar fantasies being ROOTED in masochism. I cant emphasize that word enough can I?And when you say stuff like all feminity or submissiveness in males is masochistic you totally cancel out your own rule of subjective analysis of fantasies. If one does not view feminity as masochistic then it is way more likely the arousal is rooted elsewhere.There are many alternatives out there ex. arousal of feminity itself love of feeling sexy love of the fabrics in womens clothing.. And again none of them more or less valid than MEF.. Let others be the judge of their fantasies is the point im trying to drive home here but it seems too difficult to understand...,MEFetishism,cxyyl6a,1,t5_36x7u

6480649,0,t3_3xvl0r,This is pretty much my dream  great thread. The word boyfriend itself makes me feel giddy. I mean I had a few crushes on girls as a kid but they never went beyond anxious onesided puppy love no sexual arousal at all I still just had the same fetish fantasies as usual never of a girl. With guys its you know the full shebang. Its only been in the past few years where I really started thinking about it instead of totally avoiding the possibility of ever thinking about guys seriously like that because I mean thats so like gay. but when it finally hit me it was like Ohh wow so THIS is what its like because I never understood where other guys or girls were coming from when they talked about lovesexrelationshipsdesiresetc in general. Like what was the big deal right? Since then man Ive fallen head over heels with some guys I know...as well as noticing more handsome guys whenever I go out or watch certain shows or just daydream and so on. Theyre just so attractive. I just want to huge and kiss and be held by and so many other things! Maybe its just the emasculation talking but still. Also its pretty common with transgenders on HRT as well. I feel the majority of this fetish barely ever touches on this at all which is a huge shame. It focuses so much on cocks but nobody cares about the guys at all! It almost feels like denial...I mean how can they NOT like guys?? But I guess some just dont really like them.,MEFetishism,czpnau6,1,t5_36x7u

7159511,0,t3_4dkycu,I think its just plain masochism just gay men are more akin to women sexually and I think there are definitely women out there who get off on female oppression if you want to call it that. Of course the reasons that a gay man or female would have a masochistic sexuality is different than the reason a straight male would develop a masochistic sexuality.The thought of being a used up whore is pretty universally sexy though man or woman straight or gay.,MEFetishism,d1rytj4,2,t5_36x7u
7490748,0,t1_d2rkybq,In Italy there was a movie called To my mother on her birthdayit depicted a sick motherson relationship in which the mother a rich selfish and cold woman emasculated his son who at  is still a virgin and masturbates himself in front of photos of him as a woman.The movie has a twist when a cute and beautiful waitress enters the house... the two fell in love and... the mother intervenes. It is a sad and hot movie especially the part when the waitress sees and accepts the emasculated and perverted nature of the son.,MEFetishism,d2tnof3,1,t5_36x7u

7907198,0,t3_4nl7n8,Oh hes definitely a sissy and he is fucking hot. If I looked feminine like that I wouldnt be able to keep the cocks out of my mouth and asshole.It is interesting that you mention people think hes gay knowing that other men think you are gay must create a tremendous amount of emasculation anxiety and youd probably imagine yourself doing the gay acts that people already assume you are doing anyway.I think you are right that any guy who is constantly dropping hints about wearing womens clothes or even if a guy has a tendency to be too open in calling other men cute you can be fairly certain that youve found someone who is a sissy or at least they are extremely vulnerable to becoming one. ,MEFetishism,d44ue95,2,t5_36x7u
8160892,0,t3_4r0gbn,I work with a team of women in my corporate job workplace. Frequently men address the team as girls or ladies especially dominant men. The most dominant man of the lot with the highest position sometimes looks and grins at me when he says it. This guy is your typical dominant corporate executive well respected by the men and always talking about sports. He is tall and muscular with  that rare kind of masculine face seldom seen on anyone other than prison inmates MMA fighters or male porn stars.Sometimes I worry about caving in the presence of such as dominant man perhaps Id answer the phone and sound like a sissy or accidentally call him hunk instead of Hank.

Unlike most MEF gurls you sound like the perfect candidate for feminization. Even in heels you would be only . What hairstyle would you wear? What cup size would look good on you?
