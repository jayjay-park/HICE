They are stronger than normal humans even without being spiked because they descended from true Koloss i.e. humans with four Hemalurgic iron spikes that greatly enhanced their strength and mutated their Spiritweb.According to Brandon being spiked has became a voluntary thing for the Kolossblooded. On one hand accepting the Koloss spikes would make them even stronger than their unspiked brethren. On the other hand it would also make them vulnerable to mental control which a Kolossblooded person might not want.,Mistborn,cnk5gbb,1,t5_2s9ue

By the time of The Final Empire allomancy has been diluted to a point where its nearing . Kelsier Pushes on an object and is pushed back with equal force. Vin is slightly stronger being the daughter of a stronger allomancer so her ratio may be . or . enough to beat an experienced mistborn in a Pushing match but not legendary. Elends allomancy being from the same source as the original mistborn is more like a . ratio. Strong enough he can knock an inquisitor over without being blown away himself.For reference to how awesome The Lord Rulers powers were since he could compound as much as he pleased his ratio would be  or as close as you can get to it without actually being a god.,Mistborn,d22w54u,1,t5_2s9ue

9904476,0,t3_5h9z3x,My opinion is that publication order by series is the best way to go though that is a little flexible. From what I have seen the reason the reading order appears mixed up is that someone has read outside of that order. Not to say that you cant and shouldnt do that but certain Cosmere Easter eggs have a much larger impact if youve read other works. For example Elantris Warbreaker and Mistborn Era  can all be read in any sort of order. For the biggest impact read Mistborn Era  after Era  pretty simple and read Mistborn Secret History after Bands of Mourning Era  Book . But heres where it gets a little tricky because many people read through all of Mistborn but may not have read Elantris. For full impact one should read Elantris BEFORE Mistborn Secret History. Ideally to prevent loss of immersion you could slot it in before or after Mistborn Era  in the reading order. The other thing that I have seen many people do is start reading the Cosmere with the Stormlight Archive. Which is great! But to get the full impact of Words of Radiance Book  you need to have read Warbreaker. This is probably the biggest reason for the read out of order business that you have noticed because someone has already read Way of Kings before reading Warbreaker. To simplifyElantris gt Mistborn Era Warbreaker gt Stormlight ArchiveAny of the main Cosmere installments you can kind of fit around these.If you want a more comprehensive look at the Cosmere then you should go and pick up Arcanum Unbounded  the short story collection  reading each respective short story after its novel counterpart.
