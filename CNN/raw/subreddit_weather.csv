All of the sudden it stopped and we were able to see a couple trailer homes that were completely obliterated by what I believe to be a tornado that we were very close behind. There were downed power lines and people screaming and one man in the front yard who had been hit in the head with a toilet while in his home. Sadly he and one other lost his life that day.

When an office deems it necessary to change coverage patterns on their radar they will change it for the next scan.Your best bet is going to continue to be what youre doing checking on a short interval for an update. This NOAA page has a list of the different coverage patterns and the time to complete them on the bottom of each page. The fastest one seems to be VCP  at . minutes per scan. This might suggest you shouldnt bother checking more frequently then  minutes since the previous scan.Keep in mind those numbers are probably preSAILS...I think SAILS allows the base scans to come out almost twice as fast? So maybe changing your interval to  seconds would be the best bet...I believe thats what Gibson Ridge software uses.

Lightning is often in excess of  million volts. An typical car battery is  volts. Hybrids are sometimes as many as a few hundred volts lightning is  volts. Its a lot. People die when they get hit by lightning because it converts channels in their body into plasma and they burst into flame from the inside out. Shes right to be concerned.

9192633,0,t1_d8h14ac,well one of the big reasons is to hold down the fort stop any flooding get windows coveredprotected. The other reason is to protect the home from people that want to loot right after the hurricane and protect your belongings. We evacuated to the mainland from the island.we also have  cats we brought them withRight now the home we are sheltered in is rated for a category  hurricane. Now every home down here is hurricane resitant or proof you can bunker down in your house and ignore an evacuation. One of the main reasons its deadly is because if someone were to happen to you or your house. There will be no one to help or rescue you for probably days. Now the unable to get a ride the police go door to door and if you cant get out physically they will make sure you have an exit. If they are stubborn and refuse to go majority are elderly and just dont care anymore they cannot be forced to leave and I will personally never understand why they want that. The shelters also allow pets they have specifically assigned shelters that you can bring pets to. Our reason is that we havent lived in our condo for even  days before the EVAC was announced and we didnt know the strength of our buildingGranted it was built in  and has withstood several hurricanes and we decided to get some valuablesnecessities and goto a house we have access too thats rated for hurricanes. ,weather,d8h8fqr,2,t5_2qi0i

9403195,0,t1_d97wt2q,The above has model data for multiple centres for the past  years or so. You shouldnt need to be affiliated with anyone just sign up for a username and you should be good. Theres a ton of data tho.  And this is raw data.   Edit I dont know and I somewhat doubt that private weather companies would archive their forecasts on public accessible pages. Which would make your plan much easier.   Edit  for a class project the above is probably too much. Maybe pick a notable case from your area then you could grab a couple of forecasts for that time and see how they do compared to the hr  for the same time. ,weather,d97x6vv,2,t5_2qi0i

Severe turbulence for . hours and the captain said it was the worst he had experienced.The navigator said the atmospheric pressure dropped really low lower than he had seen  at least on his instruments since he had been flying but I may have misconstrued what he said or misunderstood.

11023863,0,t1_dehii17,Its always a risk no matter what. Some situations are less risky than others. Even underground shelter cant always protect one from a tornado. Putting yourself out on the road puts you at a much greater risk than being inside in your basementbathroomcloset. A car can so easily be thrown and mangled by the winds of a tornadic storm alone. Why risk putting yourself in danger when you have a better chance in your home? If you get stuck in a crowd of people trying to flee youve made yourself a sitting duck. What if you were killed because of an action you assumed was safer? The tornado couldve harmlessly passed your entire neighborhood and instead crossed the highway you are in this scenario. But bottom line there really is no  safe place from a tornado. Its a matter of being in the safest place you can be and a car is the second worst place to be. A house or apartment built on a solid foundation can hold up much better than a metal object only a portion of size and weight of a home. ,weather,dehiwow,2,t5_2qi0i
