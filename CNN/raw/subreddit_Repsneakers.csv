3168749,0,t3_2w7paj,Because After World War Two thousands of Nazis and wartime collaborators from France Croatia Belgium and other parts of Europe were looking for a new home preferably as far away from the Nuremberg Trials as possible. David welcomed hundreds if not thousands of them the Sneakerahead regime went to great lengths to get them there sending agents to Europe to ease their passage providing travel documents and in many cases covering expenses. Even those accused of the most heinous crimes such as Ante Pavelic whose Croatian regime murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs Jews and Gypsies Dr. Josef Mengele whose cruel experiments are the stuff of nightmares and Adolf Eichmann Adolf Hitlers architect of the Holocaust were welcomed with open arms.During World War Two David favored the Axis because of close cultural ties with Germany Spain and Italy. This is not surprising as most Davids were of Spanish Italian or German descent. Nazi Germany nurtured this sympathy promising important trade concessions after the war. David was full of Nazi spies and Sneakerahead officers and diplomats held important positions in Axis Europe. Davids government was a big fan of the fascist trappings of Nazi Germany spiffy uniforms parades ralliesand vicious antiSemitism. Many influential Davids are wealthy businessmen and members of the government were openly supportive of the Axis cause none more so than David himself who had served as an adjunct officer in Benito Mussolinis Italian army in the late s. Although Argentina would eventually declare war on the Axis powers a month before the war ended it was partly a ploy to get Sneakerahead agents a place to help defeated Nazis escape after the war.TLDR U MAD BRUH,Repsneakers,coqftwu,1,t5_334km

In comparison of  legits vs reps the reps run wider in the toe and dont hug your foot. I have heard people say TTS size up and size down. I have a theory the reps sizing is inconsistent due to lack of quality control at the manufacturer. I have another pair or ultra reps in the mail.

To answer Are you guys too broke there may be some people who cannot afford to put that much money towards shoes however I have heard tons of people on here and on rFashionreps who will justify a purchase to that amount only if it matches the quality. Coming from my position not trying to brag in any way but I have the means to make such purchases regularly. I feel that the money I save from avoiding resellers can be better spent on items which price directly matches its quality like my car for instance. ,Repsneakers,d0sbfd8,18,t5_334km

An inverted replica complements the original by filling its gaps. It can be a copy used for historical purposes such as being placed in a museum. Sometimes the original never existed. Replicas and reproductions can be related to any form of licensing an image for others to use whether it is through photos postcards prints miniature or full size copies they represent a resemblance of the original object.Not all incorrectly attributed items are intentional forgeries. In the same way that a museum shop might sell a print of a painting or a replica of a vase copies of statues paintings and other precious artefacts have been popular through the ages.However replicas have often been used illegally for forgery and counterfeits especially of money and coins but also commercial merchandise such as designer label clothing luxury bags and accessories and luxury watches. In arts or collectible automobiles the term replica is used for discussing the nonoriginal recreation sometimes hiding its real identity.citation neededIn motor racing especially motorcycling often manufacturers will produce a street version product with the colours of the vehicle or clothing of a famous racer. This is not the actual vehicle or clothing worn during the race by the racer but a fullyofficiallyapproved brandnew streetlegal product in similar looks. Typically found in helmets race suitsclothing and motorcycles they are coloured in the style of racers and often carry the highest performance and safety specifications of any streetlegal products. These highperformance racelook products termed Replica are priced higher and are usually more soughtafter than plain colours of the same product.Because of gun ownership restrictions in some locales gun collectors create nonfunctional legal replicas of illegal firearms. Such replicas are also preferred to real firearms when used as a prop in a film or stage performance generally for safety reasons.A prop replica is an authenticlooking duplicate of a prop from a video game movie or television show.Contents  hide BackgroundReplicas of artefacts and artAuthenticity and replicasExamples of replicasIssues and controversiesSee alsoReferencesBackgroundeditReplicas represent a copy or forgery of another object and we often think of forgeries we think of paintings but in fact anything that is collectible and expensive is an attractive item to forge.Replicas have been made by people to preserve a perceived link to the past. This can be linked to a historical past or specific timeperiod or just to commemorate an experience. Replicas and reproductions of artefacts help provide a material representation of the past for the public.citation neededA General Terracotta Replica Warrior . m   ftReplicas of artefacts and arteditReplicas of artefacts and art have a purpose within museums and research.

In many cases the original artefact may be too frail and be to much at risk of further damage on display posing a risk to the artefact from light damage environmental agents and other risks greater than in secure storage.Replicas are created for the purpose of experimental archaeology where archaeologists and material analysts try to understand the ways that an artefact was created and what technologies and skills were needed for the people to create the artefact on display.Another reason for the creation of replica artefacts is for museums to be able to send originals around the globe or allow other museums or events to educate people on the history of specific artefacts. Replicas are also put on display in museums when further research is being conducted on the artefact but further display of the artefact in real or replica form is important for public access and knowledge.Authenticity and replicaseditReplicas and their original representation can be seen as fake or real depending on the viewer. Good replicas take much education related to understanding all the processes and history that go behind the culture and the original creation. To create a good and authentic replica of an object there is to be a skilled artisan or forger to create the same authentic experience that the original object provides. This process takes time and much money to be done correctly for museum standards.Authenticity or real feeling presented by an object can be described as the experience of an aura of an original. An aura of an object is what an object represents through its previous history and experience.Replicas work well in museum settings because they have the ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel the authentic feelings that they are supposed to get from the originals. Through the context and experience that a replica can provide in a museum setting people can be fooled into seeing it as original.The authenticity of a replica is important for the impression it gives off to tourists or observers. According to Trilling the original use of authenticity in tourism was in museums where experts wanted to determine whether objects of art are what they appear to be or are claimed to be and therefore worth the price that is asked for them or. worth the admiration they are being given.These reproductions and the values of authenticity presented to the public through artefacts in museums provide truth. However authenticity has a way of also being represented in what the public expects in a predictable manner or based on stereotypes within museums. This idea of authenticity also relates to cultural artefacts like food cultural activities festivals housing and dress that helps to homogenize the cultures that are being represented and make them seem static.For luxury goods the same authentic feel has to be present for consumers to want to buy a fake designer bag or watch that provides them with the same feelings and desired experiences but as well achieves the look of higher class.Examples of replicaseditReplicas and reproductions are also for purely consumption and personal value. Through souvenirs people can own their very own physical representation of their experience or passions. People can buy online full size replicas museumquality of the Rosetta Stone or prints and museumquality copies of the Mona Lisa and other famous pieces of art.The replica Difference Engine No.  in the Science Museum LondonFor example Difference Engine No.  designed by Charles Babbage in the th century was reconstructed from original drawings studied by Allan Bromley in the s and is now on display at the Science Museum in London England. A second example is Stephensons Rocket where a replica was built in  following the original design fairly closely but with some adaptations.In China the terracotta warriors can be recreated to be personalized for customers. The Talented craftspeople use their hands and proper tools reproducing every masterwork precisely in the same manner as the royal craftsmen did  years ago. They are made from the same local clay as the originals and constructed essentially in the same ancient method. These warriors can come in a variety of sizes and provide a very realistic and authentic experience with their own personal warrior.As the white mark prestige comes from the imitation of iPhone the white marks are the most popular brands in the world. Knockoff brand label fashions and accessories like Louis Vuitton Coach Chanel and Rolex are major labels that get copied.Issues and controversieseditControversies with replicas museum context are associated with who owns the past.With works of art museums assert their intellectual property rights for replicas and reproduction of images which many museums use commercial licensing for providing access to images. Issues are arising with more images being available on the internet and it being free access.Artists can claim copyright infringement related to displays of their work in a context they did not approve of which can be the creation of replicas of their pieces.With replica artefacts the copies to be museumquality have to reach a high standard and can cost a lot of money to be produced.Replica artefacts copies can provide an authentic view but represents more of the subjectivities of what people expect and desire from their museum experiences and the cultures they learn about.With copies of retail and other counterfeit goods there is a legal issue related to copyright and trademark ownership.,Repsneakers,d2f8g7q,-6,t5_334km

Try to avoid shipping and if you have to make sure you keep record of everything. Record your self putting them in the box and shipping label.

9453793,1,t3_5a622p,I wear legit designer gear because i love the quality and design aspect of it. Yet i buy rep yeezys because. Im not spending  on a hyped  shoe if i can get  worth of real designer stuff.. People will think they are fake anyway. I know several people with legit yeezys who get called out for wearing fakes even if their outfits were good. If a product is highly faked people will automatically assume they are fake.. Something like a designer jacket will last a long time. An adidas shoe will be worn pretty quickly generally speaking. They are not worth a grand especially after hearing and reading they will feel fakes feel about the same as retails.. I cant just go to the store and get a legit pair for a certain price i have to buy from a secoundary market which is flooded with fakes and lots of fakes beeing ridiculously close to the real deal.,Repsneakers,d9ec2zo,2,t5_334km

11621031,0,t3_65u871,edit so it seems like the shoe trees are getting a few people triggered. Just like to remind you guys a pair are reps.. I dont care about them lmao. And for the retails.. well got em for retail and gonna wear em down to the ground. so I dont care if the PK starts to rip either lmao. Thanks buds! Just helping you guys out with the comparison. I placed the trees in there to eliminate the fact of the flaw heel bump.       First and foremost its midnight right now HOPEFULLY Ill get back to this tomorrow to change up the formatting. I do have a pair of retail Belugas and PK rd batch. I did merely bought the PKs from another user here and he claims theyre PKs rd. Lets just go with it. But I bought these merely for a comparison as I havent seen havent really bothered to search actually lmao. a comparison between a retail and fake pair. So if anyone is a size  the PKs are for sale and will sell for the same price I bought them for. If anyones interested message me. Will be adding in more info whenever I get to it.     accuracy Im just going to get right into it. The build is SPOT ON. The height sure is slightly higher but there is no big difference or anything that screams FAKE when out in public. I would say the only major call out is the color. The stripe on the rd batch is too orangey compared to the retails. HOWEVER to the untrained eye and just walking out in public I doubt anyone would be able to call you out. Unless someone had a retail pair right next or nearby. The color of the stripe on the retails seem to be more of an infraorangered. BOTH PAIRS do change colors in different lightings on the stripe. Also stripe does seem to fade ever so slightly before compared to the retail. But even on retails different sizes the stripe fades differently so take that with a grain of salt.     comfortfit feels a bit the same in terms of cushioning. The primeknit does seem a bit looser on the PK pair but the sizing may have played a role in that. TO ADD MORE SOON.        FLAWS Ill keep it short and sweet. Flaws Stripe on PKs are too light more of an orange. Fade is a little low?. Looking at my retail pair some more it seems to be the same. Idk lmao. Insoles are way off didnt include a photo because its clearly extremely off lol. Is in Adidas are crooked font is extremely skinny etc. Laces seem a little flimsy as well but thats not really a flaw or call out tbh.      Will be adding in more information tomorrow whenever I get to it. May purchase PKs th batch as I heard and seen a few photos of them being a little more on point. ,Repsneakers,dgd96is,7,t5_334km
