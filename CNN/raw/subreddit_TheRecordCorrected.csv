9086403,0,t3_54q4id,I was down voted to oblivion because they were bitching about how the trump foundation got a vacation as an auction item prize for a donation at a charity ball. I am heavily involved with charity work and I put a gala together every year so I was standing up for the charity saying not to demonize them for getting such an awesome auction item donated and that the money got to the people who needed it which is the only thing that matters. Apparently charity work is bad if it means trump is slightly involved,TheRecordCorrected,d841f8l,57,t5_3fsyb
