1522283,0,t3_298jn8,Become an enterprise partner through their website. I have been one for over five years now and have taken advantage of many of the free course offerings. Youll also get access to Simpl Windows which is the tool you use to program the control processors. Start asking all your vendors for the uncompiled code. Adding room view symbols is very straight forward. I installed my own instance of fusion and manage about  conference rooms with it. I sleep comfortably knowing that my equipment gets shut of at night if someone leaves it on by accident. Its also great for digital signage off at night on in the morning. PM me if you have any specific questions. Im in the northeast and can put you in touch with my Crestron contact from the enterprise partner program. ,crestron,cj73g20,1,t5_2s072

5622035,0,t1_cwtm1t3,it isnt just the RV symbol.  There are some USP and SMW modules that need to be added to properly enable usage monitoring.  You could make them yourself but I would reach out to the FSG to see if they have any precanned.,crestron,cwtytpn,2,t5_2s072
7099540,0,t1_d1l36tz,Thats interesting  however the DMPSC is so attractive because of its price point. The newer model seems to be a lot more expensive.,crestron,d1l3r73,1,t5_2s072
7418218,0,t1_d2le0ys,Thats all good and thats the point. Crestron devices need a programmer.  Glad you were able to get it working.You can do almost anything with Crestron devices given the time and resources.,crestron,d2lejce,1,t5_2s072

7947331,0,t1_d49c9ii,Maybe we need to start a SIMPL Tricks thread since there seems to be quite a few things that are not commonly known.,crestron,d49cs5d,1,t5_2s072

8395628,0,t1_d5qpxcs,Your buffer might be fillingup. Set the socket buffer size to something crazylarge. Remember theres all of that ASCII art stuff piping through from the other end and every single spacestarlinewhatever is char out of whatever you set the buffer size to.  is a HUGE size when all of your responses are tiny things like IP addresses which are like  chars max but who knows what sorts of unprinted or blank characters let alone spacesetc. are coming through. A charsized buffer might fill up preeeety quick! You can confirm this by seeing if your processors ErrorLog recorded any Buffer Overflows.You could try using Delay after SocketSend.You could use a global integer as some sort of flag. In Main youd set it to zero. Then immediately after sending the Username youd set this global integer to . Finally after you send the password you set it back to zero again. Instead of just ifFindstuff youd say ifFindstuff amp giSentUsernameFlag  ,crestron,d5r00yd,2,t5_2s072

9106039,0,t1_d85zuzh,So it looks like I would need to have all my lighting commands on the output of the FIFO and then hit the input with my touchpanel or TOD commands. It doesnt seem like the most elegant solution but it should work. From what I can see it looks like I expand the selectfb and send that to my serial substring module for each light command. then expand the selectinputs and put the triggers there and then oscillate on the pop. Seems reasonable. ,crestron,d86eei5,2,t5_2s072

9606849,0,t1_d9x032f,Will look into it. Appreciate the feedback. What are the highest consumers of power in your experience? ,crestron,d9x8oc3,1,t5_2s072
9756841,0,t1_dafjz0n,Looks like no power on that gateway that would make the STX not work. But buttons with no feed back would press. ,crestron,dafqz1v,3,t5_2s072
9796262,0,t1_dakibb3,Much clearer!Are we talking about a mixture of  and series processors between rooms?I ask since its possible to create a SIMPL program for say a PRO but load this onto an RMC. Toolbox will display a couple of warnings and so will the error log but should work fine as long as you work within the port limitations of the smallest processor.In conjunction with this you could also have a simple text file that configures the system attributes e.g. displays touch panels etc.As with most things Crestron there and many ways to achieve the end result. SSP is also an option.,crestron,dakln36,1,t5_2s072
9829904,0,t1_dao3ghm,Yes thats what jmacd means.I think this could be a great solution but have you considered bandwidth issues?,crestron,daouwe4,1,t5_2s072
10299222,0,t3_5jmb8e,The original source code contains a routine to switch on or off the HDCP support except that it is possible for the signal to turn on HDCP support and and the signal to turn off HDCP support to both be high at the same time.As far as I can tell if both are set high at the same time HDCP on takes priority.Note to original programmer  Interlock ltgt Buffer.Going back with updated code to test tomorrow. Will let you all  know how I make out.,crestron,dcbh0s8,1,t5_2s072
10411943,0,t1_dcnd671,They arent as far as Im aware. Suggesting to replace it with something theyre more comfortable with was the issue I had with their suggestion.,crestron,dco9f47,1,t5_2s072

10744901,0,t1_dbr57qn,You jumped straight into s without going through the rest of the mess? Im equally jealous and impressed. There are a ton of gotchas that you may not have full appreciation for without some good simpl frustration. Ive been fulltime in industry yrs not that long I know most of what Ive read here has been accurate to my experience. If you want good tools to work with top help make your job easier this is the wrong industry... but if it was easy someone else would do it for a lot cheaper.  ,crestron,ddo96uj,1,t5_2s072
11018719,0,t1_degtmig,Im not saying that necessarily. Im saying the shine has come off the apple for me personally. Too many times Ive heard wow Ive never heard of that happening before yeah thats a bug Im forwarding it to engineering. Too many times Ive had to send hardware back for failures or unknown odd behavior. Too many times a new product has been introduced without being ready or at least without proper supportdocumentation for it. Apparently Crestron should hire me for product testing because in my relatively short time as a Crestron integrator Ive managed to uncover like  never before seen bugs in their products. Ever used an ADMS in a system? Ever played with the new DSP? What product replaces the BIPAD? because before I bought it Crestron presales sold me on the DSPXXXX line as a direct replacement Im not even beginning to say that control has taken the throne. All Im saying is that in the past my goto assumption is that Crestron did nothing wrong and something else is to blame me code rd party gear install etc and I no longer have that assumption of infallibility when it comes to them.  And that control is doing interesting things. Theres no doubt that control isnt there yet any system that requires true customization requires Crestron or savant sorry AMX and such arent even on my radar anymore Im sure others will disagree but the  of systems where control is good enough increases every time I think about it and weve only been a control dealer for like  months.  EDIT to be clear. I am only speaking to my own personal experience. Which Ill happily admit is very limited. Im sure way less than even the majority of the other people here. ,crestron,degxw5h,1,t5_2s072
11774129,0,t1_dgs0fv1,So to clarify...Assuming Im using a CrestronHome macro that is listed as v. in my program if the library has v. for the same macro that is the version that will be used for new compiles?I would have assumed that when I opened the program if v. was in the library that the current program instance would be updated to v. and that is what I would see when I look at the ProgramView.  Instead ProgramView shows the originally used version while the Symbol Library shows a different one.A further confusing thing is that for example in the Symbol Library for example you see in the Crestron Home section two itemsCH Audio Dist. ROOM Source Control Encoder v. cm and CH Audio Dist. ROOM Source Control Encoder v. cmHow does SimplWindows know which of these two versions to use when it compiles the program?,crestron,dgumrfp,1,t5_2s072
