8754673,0,t3_4zs8rs,Update Had some trouble getting JSRF to work on the PC so instead Im going to start going through JSR which is probably the more logical choice anyway. Wont be a completely blind run I played a little bit last year up to the New York part but I cant remember it too much so well start with a clean run from the start. If I end up finding a solution to the JSRF problem then we can go through that in the... future.Hyped for some rollerblading funk action!,JetSetRadio,d6zzpwg,1,t5_2riec
