10738973,0,t1_ddcv871,Yes Chrome Android is able to view the raw k video. To test a k video in Chrome Android you just add the filesdcard url in Chrome and navigate to the k video to test. A k video was able to load in Chrome Android v.. under Android v.. This should further suggest that this issue is attributed to three.js. ,threejs,ddnn71p,1,t5_2s8ar
