190109,0,t1_cf02iy5,Britons ancestral to the Welsh not the Irish and hailing from what is now England migrated to Armorica and northern Galicia as early as the th or th centuries not the th by which time all of England had long been well English. The Irish did do a bit of colonizing in the early middle ages but mostly only in Scotland they also seem to have left a few monks in Iceland who fled when the Norwegians showed up.Celtic peoples had existed in Iberia before then including in Galicia and indeed Celtiberian peoples are the legendary source of the fifth of the five Invasions of Ireland but they were thoroughly assimilated long before the fall of the Roman Empire.In the th century Galicia was controlled variously by the Kingdom of Leon and later the Kingdom of Galicia and Portugal.While Galician culture was influenced by the Britons and even now it preserves some Celtic traditions including a local form of the bagpipe its not accurate to describe Galician as a mixture of Portuguese and Celtic. Like most local Romance dialectslanguages the distinction is fuzzy in France and Spain Galician developed autochthonously from the local variety of Vulgar Latin on which its grammar is thoroughly basedand as with most of western Romancespeaking Europe it forms a dialect continuum with neighboring varieties. I dont know enough about Galician lexis to give a figure on the number of Celtic borrowings but even in the case of substantial lexical borrowings like those of English from French its not accurate to speak of a language as being a mixture of two others. Truly mixed languages belong to a narrow category with specific formal attributes pidgin and creole languages and they form under specific circumstances which dont include borrowings influenced by a small minority immigrant population.,imaginarymaps,cf03d30,4,t5_2vqof

Aggressive war has been viewed dimly as a matter of international law since the early th century and Morocco would be attempting to occupy a hostile population about  the size of its own in addition to its current occupation of the Western Sahara territory. Plus Spain is a member of NATO and its successor state would likely remain so thats  of the worlds military budget right there. Despite being an old ally of the US Morocco engaging in an act of war against a NATO member would pretty much trump all other obligations especially since leading NATO is much more important to the US than good relations with a relatively peripheral North African state.So even pretending in some bizarre alternate universe Morocco had any reason to want to conquer Spainwhy would they?theyd be absolutely one hundred percent totally fucked.

4575077,0,t1_ct78chp,Thanks for all your feedback. Yeah Ive thought about it and removed the regional labels at least for the time being. As for the interwar period I think I should clarify this is not a collection of countries. It is one country and the interwar bit refers to a three year period bookended by two civil wars. That being said its  not quite a unified nation either. Heres where we get a bit into the lore if youll allow me this is something I should flesh out anyway. The way the political map is set up is this I feel like I should have mentioned this earlier as it is pretty important to the world itselfand in a future iteration Ill have to find a way to make this more clear because this map makes no distinction there are twelve major cities and twelve minor cities. In the past it was this one unified country. Then some decades ago about three generations the major cities Arbithen Kelee Westgate Teuford Drisalla Devils Claw Roamburn Graybridge Kria Sila Brand and Eastgate became connected via a system of portals. Now this enabled them to form what developed into a network of cities which made trade and crosscultural communication much faster than elsewhere in the world and allowed accelerated development of technology compared to elsewhere. So the major cities became this hybrid of distinct citystates and one Industrial Revolutionlevel mega city. After this development the cities became mostly selfsufficientwhat use would the rest of the land be to them if crosscountry travel was no longer necessary? Or trade with the nonconnected cities? The major cities mostly cut themselves off from the rest of the country. The distinction between major and minor cities is because of thisbasically the cities that were left out of the loop when the portals were constructed this was due to different socioeconomic and political factors having to do with loyalty to the presiding powers were left to develop at their own pace. Hence the minor cities. These are technologically closer to the thth century and trade with each other though at a slower pace obviously. I suppose a way of summarizing it is like describing a subway system again this is more for my own need to flesh it out for myself than a need for you to hear it. Say you have a big city that reaches out from dense areas in different parts of it stretching out into suburbs and eventually into more rural parts. Connecting these parts are your standard roads no subways. This is preportal Cairnshiir. Then a subway system gets built making travel between parts of the city much faster. But of course the subway doesnt cover every part of the city just some of them. Why? What determines subway coverage? In real life theres a lot of different factors funding zoning logistics population density but in this case it can be summed up as politics. This is postportal Cairnshiir. Then the places where theres subway coverage get developed more kind of turn into hubs for themselves and generally become a little more prosperous than the noncovered areas. And the people living near the subway system who use it to get to work and stuff hardly ever need to go where there the subway doesnt go. Those places develop at their own rate while the subway zone kind of turns into this web.In a nutshell these are two worlds one country. Of course with the industrial development being mostly limited to the major cities it was bound to happen that certain things would get out certain technology would make its way to the countryside. Political ideologies that were for a long time confined to the cities made their way to the rural communities and unsettled cultures beliefs that had become established independently over the last several decades. Not only that proof that certain technology had been deliberately kept from the hands of the minor cities and villagestechnology that arguably could have saved thousands of lives in times of famine drought or disastermade its way out to the masses. Talks of rebellion and calls for change to the portal system sprang up resulting in a period of intense civil war between some of the major and minor cities particularly in the southeast. Needless to say the minor cities that banded together were defeated handily and several of them were razed and destroyed hence the ruins in the peninsular region and on the Southern Island before a ceasefire was called. Their political turmoil however spilled over into the major cities and spread pretty quickly and a couple of movements sprang up some calling for destruction of the portals others calling for expansion to the minor cities others for a turn to isolationismand in some areas calls for total independence essentially turning them into citystates. So the interwar period is very tense. Needless to say theres definitely another civil war on the horizon.Tldr me fleshing things out here rather than in my outline ,imaginarymaps,ct7ap0z,1,t5_2vqof

At  in the UN resolution it was proposed to deal with the devastated countries and try to unify both of them in order to restore peace. Both nations were disappointed of this as they wanted their independence so they tried to attack the US. They lost and Gonave Island was taken with some minor islands nearby.  As of  Hispaniola had a coup and replaced the dictator with its current president Macario Jacinto.

11543618,0,t3_64pbb6,Tamworth? Bullshit. The one true capital of the Kingdom of Mercia is Lichfield. I feel like Northumbria is too broad. The people of Lancashire arent going to be happy about being ruled from York. Meanwhile Yorkshire has its own prodevolution party it should get to count as a separate federal entity. Same as London it already has its own Assembly and has more popular support for independence than say Mercia. Cornwalls also going to want to be separate from Wessex. Id like it known Im actually in favour of this. Making England Heptarchy Again and such. I want full independence for my homeland of Mercia however Id say our definitions of Mercia differ.  ,imaginarymaps,dg4gyfk,9,t5_2vqof
11558744,0,t1_dg600ut,As a resident of Birmingham Im alright mate. Ancient capitals are either Lichfield or Tamworth. Tamworths a shed so Id rather it be Lichfield. I find the capital and largest city being separate to be a good thing like in most US states. ,imaginarymaps,dg66rx8,1,t5_2vqof
