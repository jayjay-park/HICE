5180330,0,t3_3lxadi,You have it a bit backwardsWhen you run two batteries in PARALLEL  you will roughly have double the amp limit because the batteries are sharing the load equally. For instance while one samsung r has a amp limit on paper at least two in a parallel box like yours will have a  amp limit with two samsung rs in it. I say on paper because the Samsung r batteries can be pulsed at much higher amp limitsWhat Im getting at hear is that you can safely build much LOWER resistance on your double battery box than you could on a single battery. JUst remember to use reputable safe batteries.,RDA,cvaf458,2,t5_2we93

7926659,0,t1_d4709se,Ill have to give it a try. Still learning on the fancier build front. Made a few claptons that werent too bad. Not fused though. Havent played with ribbon yet. Might be the next step. ,RDA,d47151w,1,t5_2we93
