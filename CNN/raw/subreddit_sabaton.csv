2934637,0,t1_co1i081,They do the same thing in We Burn but make it sound sinister. If you support what is said with the music saying we instead of they really doesnt change the emotional impact. If a song sounds like it glorifies something it does unless maybe if the lyrics let it become ironic. On Carolus Rex they balance it with A Lifetime of War and it is overall embedded in an very different historic context. People dont say what a monster Alexander the Great or Attila the Hun was either. But I dont think Sabaton would have made an upbeat epic song like Ghostdivison about vile war criminals.,sabaton,co1oi8a,2,t5_2upwb

Just keep all that in mind a mosh isnt a fight club its like a ritual. Enjoy the show your own way my friend.,sabaton,cqadecv,2,t5_2upwb

8662608,0,t1_d6o75bo,Yeah some of the Last Stands arent really Last Stands. Hell the Battle of Vienna which is what Winged Hussars is about ended with the HREPoland winning pretty easily. Yeah the Viennese were under siege by the Ottomans but historically speaking the Ottomans got slaughtered. The battle was basically already won by the time the Winged Hussars arrived.Maybe its just me but Last Stand would imply that the defenders lose and that only truly happens in a few notably Shiroyama Sparta and The Last Stand. Possibly Last Dying Breath but I dont know enough about that,sabaton,d6ofzgm,3,t5_2upwb

9653649,0,t3_5da9uh,Eeehhh.... Well.... Kinda true. I mean its Power Metal so you have to expect some cheesy and sometimes ridiculous lyrics. Blood of Bannockburn is also somewhat ridiculous IMO with its hammond organ and goofy sound... William Wallace and The Bruce would probably turn in the grave due to this song.Overproduced is a somewhat subjective term I think. It HAS a lot of production effort gone into it sometimes for better sometimes for worse cough cough All Guns Blazing cover cough cough.

En Livstid i Krig is probably my favourite antiwar type of song.Also a special mention to Long Live the King for being one of those songs that gives me the exact feeling it describes.
