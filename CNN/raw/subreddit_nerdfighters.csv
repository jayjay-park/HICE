963707,0,t1_chdpo2k,Do you understand how science works?  Because it sure sounds like you dont.You have shown absolutely no evidence for you assertion other than hot air.  A quick perusal of the literature brought up references that at least some heavy metal ion absorption is via passive diffusion or passive ion channel transport   That means that some heavy metal ion transport is going to be driven by concentration gradients.  You lower the intestinal loading of a heavy metal ion the ions will diffuse out of the body.  Thats basic chemistry.Now is that a particularly effective means of pulling heavy metal ions of of the rest of the body?  Probably not.  Medical heavy metal chelation therapy is done intravenously for a reason.  Will ingested clay remove heavy metals from the rest of the body in amounts anyone cares about over long periods of time?  As far as I can tell there is no data either way for that.  I would guess that if it does its a mediocre at best way of doing it.Does eating clay provide a net reduction of heavy metals in the body and does that benefit outweigh the known interference it as with nutrient uptake and possible heavy metal contamination from eating the wrong clays?  Again theres no solid data I can find for that.Personally I wouldnt eat clay.  However its a folk treatment for intestinal and dietary issue found worldwide in many cultures and practised by multiple animal species.  Presumably there is at least some evolutionary pressure to eat clays whether its for heavy metal reduction nutrient availability or antimicrobial effects.  Is there still a compelling reason to eat clay with a modern diet?  Probably not.  But its certainly not an idea that doesnt have factual grounding.Where the hell are you getting your assertion that there is no biological pathway for efflux of heavy metal ions through the intestines?  Are you an expert in this field?  Have you bothered looking up data on it?  Unless you can show that the uptake of heavy metals is actively driven and oneway simple diffusion kinetics dictate that the heavy metal ion concentration of the rest of the body will decrease.  The rate of that ion removal may not be clinically significant but the laws of physics dictate that it will occur.  At best the answer is you dont know.  Its a reasonable assertion that clay in the GI tract is not a particular powerful or effective means of removing heavy metal ions from the body.  However your blanket statement that Not from your digestive tract it doesnt has absolutely nothing to back it up.  Its at odds with the laws of physics and unless you can provide some citation or evidence youre exhibiting the exact same sloppy Oh I just think thats how it works no need to actually test thinking that the nutty pseudo science nutbags that eat cupfulls of EDTA to prevent autism are doing.,nerdfighters,chdtzh5,2,t5_2rocp

While the whole environmental impact of eating meat is true it is rarely the crux of the argument for the vegans and vegetarians that are truly annoying. The ones that most meat eaters like myself find annoying are the ones that frame their argument in a moral eating meat is murder one which casts the argument as a moral one. Most vegetarians view the killing of an animal for food as morally wrong where as most meat eaters dont view what the problem is and vegetarians that view meat as murder are more likely to make a big fuss about their friend enjoying a steak. And why wouldnt they? If someone truly believed that anothers actions were murder they wouldnt just sit there silently out of respect for that persons right to act that way. And heres where the annoyance comes in. It should come as no surprise that people dont like being told that their actions that they believe to be morally OK are morally wrong.

The front page algorithm tries to show you a diverse selection from all your subscriptions so even if something only gets  upvotes it has good chance on showing up on lots of people front pages which is where most people will find posts.This sub is a very positive sub in general most of the posts have really high upvote to downvote ratios but I know I sometimes look at a post without voting on it so as a community we have to try to vote more often. ,nerdfighters,d5n5mrn,11,t5_2rocp

8661428,0,t1_d6o6oof,gt If the government could ensure that the number of gas cars would be much less that would be good enough. Theres no need to ban them completely.Thats exactly what a stop in sales is! When you look around you you can see that most of the cars are not from . If all cars from  were electric by law there would be a larger percentage of them but most of them still wouldnt be electric. Now look how many cars are still driving from  or from  or earlier if theyre taken care of and made well. If you want a way for the government to gradually increase the number of electric cars while decreasing the amount of gasoline cars this is it. gt If it were to ban gas cars that would be in effect a huge subsidy to the electric car industry.Thats not what a subsidy is but okay lets roll with it. Companies that make electric cars would be at an obvious advantage over companies that dont. But they make electric cars already. And in this situation they would get to know that they have to change over production to fully electric vehicles in the next decade. The government isnt picking winners and losers rather the Dutch government is picking the responsible technology over the decidedly irresponsible technology. The same way the sale of lead paint was banned. Or maybe youve wondered why your local gasoline pump specifies that the fuel is unleaded. Tetraethyllead was also banned for its cumulative effect on people and the environment. This isnt as simple as youre making it out to be. You keep ignoring the fact of global climate change. If the gasoline car wins the planet loses along with all of us on it. Now maybe this doesnt address many other problems like coal fire plants or the environmental effects of a meatcentric diet etc. But you cant dismiss a solution to one problem just because it doesnt address all problems. Otherwise only a silver bullet would do and we cant expect such a thing to exist. On that point yes it would take some overhaul both within the auto industry and as a matter of infrastructure. But The Netherlands is a small country with a low percentage of car ownership already. This is a good place to start and a good way to start. Hopefully other countries follow their lead.    ,nerdfighters,d6oanrd,2,t5_2rocp

9432045,0,t1_d9b7m2f,Its not necessarily about fixed destiny so much as it is about what determines destiny.  Your reading is on what Diamond says about geography vs inherent human differences and what Im advocating is that the reasons for cultural dominance are not only more complex than geography but also a direct reflection upon decisions made by individual humans as well as the culture that those individuals existed within.  Diamond does not leave room for motivations like greed or glory which in the case of the Spanish conquest of Mexico for example were far more important than geography guns germs or  steel.It is a popular myth that the Spanish won out because of the european diseases that ravaged the native masses followed by the military superiority of the Europeans themselves.  However at least in the case of the Aztecs this is not what happened.  Diamond apparently unaware of this marches on undeterred to use primary source documents from the conquistadors without a hint of skepticism.  Instead of considering that the Spanish may have been lying bastards that took advantage of underlying political conditions by manipulating competing tribes into thinking that the Spanish were somehow friends with mutual best interests in mind before stabbing their allies in the back Diamond poses the notion that the Spanish just had so many advantages when they arrived that the Mesoamericans could never have hoped to compete which is a view that I dont think is well supported and is in fact the opposite of true.So you see its not about whether environment affects destiny but rather the degree which separates environmental determinists from the field of social science at large. Many many naturalscience prognosticators like Diamond think that they can just jump in to social science with their perspective and their damn genius and viola! they will finally show the troglodytes in the anthropology and history and economics departments how science done.  What they never realize is that we tried that  years ago and the ideas that it brought us are now largely dead for a reason.  We need to apply more care to the way in which we gather evidence not to mention how we analyze it than most biologists have a clue about. Thats what happens when you cant run experiments to find the truth of a matter the science gets muddy. This gets back to something else I read the other day about complexity in social science and why they distrust simple solutions the simple solutions are just always wrong.  They dont have to be but they have been so far.  This is why social scientists take such umbrage at the STEM folks constantly poking their noses in our turf those folks are used to a clean science that does not exist in this field.  They will even tell us on occasion that we are not using the scientific method properly and so are not scientific.  Then they complain that we treat their inane bull as the junk that it is and have the gall to say that we just dont understand it. You know what Mr Diamond?  Maybe try getting a phd in Geography and History before you write a book about Geography and History and you wont say stupid shit that makes our blood boil and makes us all come down so hard on you.

10360537,0,t1_dchxhmt,Well there are a few points to consider.The first one is that you cannot contact the creators. The moment the project was funded they ceased almost all communication. They left the comment section and quit replying to personal messages. This is a serious nogo. Dont forget that they had a stretch goal unlocked a lot of tweets. Again Seeing how active Hank is on twitter I find it hard to believe that he thinks once every month is a lot. Oh almost forgot if you followed twitter you got more information than if you checked the kickstarter backer pages seems fair no? Its only K people funding more than K but they its ok to leave so many people in the dark for so long.Second their updates are cryptic. They use language as very soon which apparently means  months. They update their project status maybe once every  weeks? Have you ever backed something else? Once every  weeks is the bare minimum.Third no regard for nonAmerican backers. No information nor replies to get the gameexpansion as one package. This is very fun  because of a double customs fee. To be fair they released ?somewhere? information that they would pay back the second customs. I have no clue how they are going to arrange this but if they had taken a few minutes to check their messages this blunder would have been avoided.As I mentioned in my original post the game itself has some hiccups Misprints unclear rules wrong material ... Again for some reason we got a cryptic tweet instead of an explanation update.And lastly and this is in my opinion the worst they wont acknowledge any of these problems. There have been no apologies not even a mention that they might have fucked up or made mistakes. It is always the fault of some other company and they plainly ignore the outcries from the community.For someone with so much experience with online communities and projects this was extremely disappointing.,nerdfighters,dcifesu,3,t5_2rocp

11353012,0,t3_61vgph,I was really surprised by Johns answer to the question about media bias. Hes probably right that some people conflate opinion sections with news sections but I think the issue of bias in the news is a lot broader than that. I think the biggest way news organizations show their biases even in their hardjournalism purefactbasedreporting sections is how they choose to present the information. Two newspapers can report completely same facts but leave their readers with different impressions depending on what information goes in the headlinelede.  Cable news does the same thing. As I type this here are the chyrons for each of the three major cables news channels in America theyre all covering the same thingthe daily White House press conferenceFox News WH REACTS TO CLAIMS ABOUT SALLY YATES TESTIMONY CNN WH DENIES TRYING TO BLOCK YATES RUSSIA TESTIMONYMSNBC WHITE HOUSE DISPUTES LETTERS ALLEGING ADMIN. TRIED TO BLOCK EXACTING ATTY. GENERAL FROM TESTIFYING ON RUSSIAGranted this is just a random example from a random portion of the hour news cycle but its interesting to think about the differences between those three totally factual chyrons.  The Fox News chyron doesnt even make it clear who these CLAIMS are being made about it just points out that the White House is reacting to them.  CNN clears it up a little bit by using the word DENIES and then MSNBC just spells out the whole situation for you in novella form.  Im certainly no fan of Donald Trump or the GOP but when they complain that journalists are out to get them I think theyre mostly right about that and I think thats a good thing.  I think its great when journalists are out to get politicians adversarial journalism FTW! but if they only appear to be out to get the ones from a particular party then it becomes easy for partisans to tune those news sources out.  Maybe Im just extra sensitive to this after seeing the disappointing way they covered the Democratic primary race but I think a lot of reporters who work for major news organizations including some of the ones on Johns reading list tend to engage in dogged hardnosed journalism when theyre covering one side and then consistently go super easy on the other side.,nerdfighters,dfiucrl,1,t5_2rocp
