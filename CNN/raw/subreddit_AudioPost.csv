1719445,0,t3_2e43w5,This would fit in better at rAudioengineering as this sub is more for postproduction audio than musical audio engineering. What youre probably after is a DAW Digital Audio Workstation like PTCubaseLogicAbletonetc rather than a wave editor like AudacitySoundforgeetc. There is a lot of debate when it comes to which DAW is the best and a lot of it is personal taste and preferences in workflow between individuals. It also depends on your budget  if youre a bit strapped for cash then Id advise you to get Reaper as for the tiny price tag its just as powerful if not more so than some of the more popular DAWs. If youre sequencing a lot of electronic music then Ableton may be a better bet. If you have no budget for plugins then Logic may be a good idea as the stock plugins are better than most. ,AudioPost,cjvwdpt,3,t5_2seyx

4770801,0,t1_ctvvt3y,. A Lossless file format eg. wav aiff flac etc.is one that is a perfect encoding of the data. Theres no loss of information. A Lossy file format eg. mp ogg is simply one that is aimed at reducing disk space usage and to do this it uses special algorithms that cut out parts of the data.    Its worth noting that a lossy kbps mp is audibly indistinguishable to a lossless . wav for  of the population despite the mp often being  times smaller in file size. Lossless files are needed for recording and production but as a final format lossy files are very often more than enough.. Yes .wav ensures perfect looping. This should be true for any lossless encoding format as far as I know.. Im not  sure on either WMM or Premiere but Premiere at least will almost certainly support .ogg. Its a very widelyused format. WMM may not support it though. Try both!If you have any further questions feel free to speak up!,AudioPost,ctvwhsr,1,t5_2seyx

For instance perhaps you create a loudnoisy background for wherever hes being injected and do a sweeping highpass as it injects. That along with a subtle SFX of your choice could give the effect hes going for. Pull them into his narrationinner thoughts as the mind control sets in.

Im sort of doing general pan adjustments on the BG and music tracks i.e. sending an entire track to the surrounds another halfway between front and back etc. Then Ill listen through and make adjustments as I feel it needs.

Youre coming to a forum with people that have degrees and years of industry experience asking what software will allow you to do various modulation fx.

If the files are something like ShowNameFoleyTakeSomeonesInitials know that you are using someone elses creative work. As in please dont do it if you dont have permission.
