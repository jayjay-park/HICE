1010980,0,t1_chhl20p,Correct cats do not piss on your things like dogs do. If a cat pisses outside of a litter box it is a sign of health issues. Dogs not so much. Puppies are the worst. By  weeks the average cat is  potty trained and you can even train them to pee in the toilet. You need luck to even get a fullgrown dog to pee on a puppy pee pad which is scented and everything. However cats DO show love my cat greets me at the door sleeps in my arms at night follows me around the house during the day claims me by rubbing along my ankles talks to me when she sees me by chirping and meowing and even grooms me. She spends every night since I got her curled as close to my heartbeat as she can get even when there were other pets to sleep with and cozy animal beds. ,guing,chj7fcn,1,t5_2xlga
