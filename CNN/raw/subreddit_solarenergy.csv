10373744,0,t3_5ogi34,The really really important thing to note is that AC electric grids cannot work when there is a glut or shortage of electricity.  Supply has to match demand at every instant.Glut is moderately easy to manage Hawaii illustrates the principle that as there is an excess of power everyones inverters scale back ultimately to zero output.  As long as everyone plays by the rules too much generation can be managed.Shortage is harder.  Either power has to appear from somewhere be it batteries conventional power plants wherever or load has to be shed.  Or the grid collapses.,solarenergy,dcjxcth,2,t5_2qqdi
