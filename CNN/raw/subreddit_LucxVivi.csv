11012266,0,t3_5x4fqp,A day in the life of a villainWe all never pay much mind to Villains do we? When theyre not out committing evil killing people and stealing what they want what do they do? Where do they go? Here we will try and answer these questions by focusing on the organization know as Black Stain. Our story begins one rather mundane saturday morning and the apartment of one Glenroe. The dark room with its windows blacked out lies heavy with moisture. Its ten AM but you wouldnt even be able to tell the room is so dark.A small figure rises from a bed over in the corner rubbing his tired eyes even after sleeping heavy bags sit under those black eyes of his. His body always felt so slow. But now he only felt...Glenroe ...Hungry.He muses slowly walking over to the kitchen opening a fridge and squinting in the light. Sadly there was nothing there. Oh right he had to go buy groceries. How long had it been since he last did that? oh well. Time to go outside.Walking to the closet he rummages around a haphazardly strewn about pile of clothes before finding a jacket. He didnt even sweat anymore so his clothes didnt really smell. Throwing it on he slowly walks over to his front door. As the maw of darkness peels back the light from the hallway pours onto the pale face of Glenroe causing him to squint even more than when he opened the fridge. This was the issue with outside he thought to himself much too brightHe begins the slow shuffle towards the elevator which would take him down to the first floor. Ever since he had begun embracing his quirk and taking it to this level rapid movement was strenuous. Not that he cared to move any faster anyway. He didnt have much to gain by going any faster.Pressing the button next to the elevator it lights up with a ding indicating he wanted to go down. The wait seemed like an eternity and standing next to him was another man dressed in a suit. He was nearly a foot taller and seemed rather impatient. Their gaze met for a moment and the man seemed rather uncomfortable.Finally the elevator doors opened letting a woman and her child out and they pair stepped into the small room. The man in the elevator pressed  just before Glenroe reached over and pressed . What a pain...theyd have to stop on a floor before his. He felt for a moment something in his mind telling him he ought to just kill this guy...but thatd be a lot of work. and the elevator would still open on floor .After what felt like an eternity he finally exited the elevator in the lobby of his apartment complex. A few steps later there was a buzzing in his pocket. Seems his phone was ringingGlenroe ...yeah?A voice on the other end sounds professional uptight and punctual. Could only be one guy...Cole We need you at headquarters ASAP. seems weve got a new target.Cole reads....wait this isnt ordinary this is villain work! Were getting off topGlenroe ...Can I have a warp?Glenroe responds simply. It would take him forever to get over there anyway public transport was pretty crappy around here. Cole just sighsand by the way the narrator does NOT appreciate being interrupted!Cole Fine. tell me when youre someplace private and Ill get you here.Glenroe had no choice but to head outside and into the alley next to his complex where Cole was able to open up the choppy square looking warp which Glenroe stepped through.Unsurprisingly he was nearly the last to arrive finding himself in their meeting room a long table with thirteen seats. most of the time only twelve were occupied as their boss did most of his communication remotely. He took his place at the seat marked  and looked around at who all was thereTo his right was seated the everpleasant number  DeLeon. Aster was down at the number  and next across the table to the left was number  Lapis. seat number  across from him was Cole who seemed rather preoccupied as he tapped away on a laptop his phone next to him. At the number  seat was Asura who seemed much too big for this table. So...Jabra Nathaniel Lemon Karloff and Vincent were missing...Cole Before any of you ask He glares at Aster Ive confirmed weve got Jabra coming as well. He should be here momentarily through my warp.And right Cole was as out from the portal stepped the rather large man the one known as Jabra. He walked over to his place at the th seat and sat down arms folded.Cole and that ought to be everyone. Alright He adjusts his glasses Then as todays proxy Ill be giving out the mission assignments. First up we have a target for assassination. Seems as though a big hit has been put out for a member of the criminal underground. Big bounty means big money and your paycheck. Hes apparently got a quirk which lets him drill through most surfaces using his body. should be easy enough but well stick to the pair system. Who wants the job?Glenroe didnt really want to do an assassination right now. He was pretty damned hungry and it was going to affect his performance in combat. Hmmmm...but that money would buy food.Glenroe Can I eat the body when we kill him?He asks sluggishly his stomach growling. DeLeon just chuckles apparently finding this situation humorous. Glenroe didnt think so but he knew he wasnt going to do anything about it.Cole His body needs to be identified so thats a no. If youre that hungry just eat his henchmen or something. You want in on this or not?Glenroe ...sure.Would be pretty easy and he got a free meal. Just one other person had to sign up and theyd be off. But who else would want to take on this mission? All of a sudden from out of nowhere??? WAAAAAAIT! I WILL BE GOING! That voice...how could he forget the first ever member of Black Stain number one herself ShalltearShalltear I hope you idiots didnt forget about me in the midst of whatever petty squabble you were having but I believe I will take this one. I am quite thirsty myself and this is a perfect opportunity to sate said thirst.Cole Alright you two will go. Make sure to bring the body back. Heres the personnel file youll need.He slides a manilla folder with some papers over to Shalltear.Cole Ill open a warp for you both to the city of Manhattan. Thats his base of operations. And try not to damage too much else besides the target. please.He asks though he suspected his warnings oft went unheeded.As they both passed through the warp into an alleyway in Manhattan Shalltear sighsShalltear  I dont like the idea of working with you but we have a job to finish. lets just get this over with. Im too damned thirsty for this.She says before flinchinga drop of rain hits her head. Seems like this was a rainy day indeed...guess this was pretty far away from home after all. Rain didnt bother Glenroe much but Shalltear pulled out am umbrella just as gaudy as her gothloli apparel tended to be.Shalltear And try not to lag too far behind! That mushroom only makes your brain mush!Glenroe Hey...this mushroom is the future. Its a level of power...you just dont get.He says trudging behind her as she begins to look through the personnel fileShalltear Ugh...sewers. Why is it always sewers?! Cant they have a respectable place of business?!Glenroe They are...the manhattan UNDERground...so....no.Shalltear murmurs something under her breath. She was clearly regretting this decision already. Glenroe wasnt so much preoccupied with her state of mind as he was getting something to eat. He was beginning to feel...impatient.Shalltear suddenly stops they stand in front of a large sewer grate on the ground. Was this their ticket in?Shalltear Open it you fool! dont expect a lady to work so hard!Glenroe you know...Im not...THAT strong...He says staring at her with his souless eyes. His body was half fungus no longer strong enough to do such things. She was going to have to work whether she liked it or not.Shalltear Tch...fine.She huffs slamming her heel down on the grate which gives way quite easily. Even so starved of blood she was strong. Awfully terrifying to imagine her at her prime strength,LucxVivi,deg7k0m,1,t5_33maw
