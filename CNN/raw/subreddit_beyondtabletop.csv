9654807,0,t1_da31n70,Hey again I apologize Im still struggling. Heres the thing. I am pretty proficient with computers. There is a dropdown box under the label weapon however that is only under the equipment tab. I have added other weapons several times however only my first weapon battleaxe appears on the overview page. Whenever I attempt to edit my overview page for DND however you can only add overview blocks. Under the overiew blocks the term attacks is an option but no way to distinguish the types of attacks you can do. This is how it is in my Pathfinder character sheet as well however when I include an attack overview block to the overview tab it includes all of my attack options and weapons. On my DND character sheet every time I select an attacks overview block only one weapon appears even though I have more than on. I keep resorting to have to jump back and forth between my equipment tab and my overview tab during a battle. Does that make sense? ,beyondtabletop,da35mhb,1,t5_37iiq
