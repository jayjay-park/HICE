1711692,0,t1_cjux1vh,No. I am Professional Staff. We are about  of the employees on campus. We do a lot of grantwriting and research similar to some of the nonclassroom work professors do but we do not teach. I have a Masters Degree. Although there are exceptions in some departments you generally have to have a Ph.D. to teach at Western.  ,WWU,cjux5ss,1,t5_2rjx9

2688833,0,t1_cn974df,That only works if you know what books you need. I usually buy used on amazon but only one my classes has put book store and they did it after christmas. Its not available on amazon anyway so it doesnt matter. But Im sure there are other teachers that wait to give the bookstore the book list until way late. ,WWU,cn9jtd5,1,t5_2rjx9
2731551,0,t1_cne7oov,I dont think you need letters and I think in a previous thread someone said that the school doesnt want them so ask the admissions people. The essay is super important but your score seem fine to get in. So just write a good essay.,WWU,cnekdqz,0,t5_2rjx9

3907325,0,t3_354mrh,Big drawbacks  The rooms are pretty small and its pretty far away from most classes and other things on campus. However its also a really cool environment they really have their own culture down there. Its also a beautiful part of campus if youre into the woodsy vibe. ,WWU,cr1o46q,2,t5_2rjx9
3909499,0,t3_354pw4,Everyone here pretty much covered the basics so Ill give you slightly different advice. Remember to look around and savor the moment. Appreciate the freedom and how much fun your having. Freshman year goes by so fast. That year is still one of the best years of my life. Almost all my best friends today  years later are people I either met or roomed with that year. So have some fun and remember to appreciate just how sick life is! ,WWU,cr1x1sj,2,t5_2rjx9

5389340,0,t3_3ossj1,Bearded dragons kinda suck as pets also. I know my roommate runs to the pet food store like every  days to buy more crickets and your dragon doesnt eat those all at once so the lizard isnt the only pet you have you also have a bunch of chirpers living with you,WWU,cw0jrhv,1,t5_2rjx9
5390789,0,t3_3osnf7,Oh man during one of these interviews I asked why they didnt have a regular applicationinterview process instead of doing the group thing and the guy interviewing me got really defensive. It was embarrassing. ,WWU,cw0qfgz,3,t5_2rjx9

5769712,0,t1_cxc8y7n,Absolutely.  To be honest my kneejerk reaction was to be skeptical about this being an actual issue.  Now Im glad school was cancelled and I totally get why the AS president would feel threatened if her picture was posted on Yik Yak.  That being said I still think shes pretty fuckin ridiculous for saying the mascot is racist.,WWU,cxcabh7,2,t5_2rjx9
6332113,0,t1_cz9cqiu,I would just hate to wait for a toilet or shower or make someone wait while I was taking a shit or throwing up with a wicked hangover like you would in suite style. In my hallway style bathroom I never had to wait for a toilet or a shower. Also in hallway style the bathrooms were always impeccably clean. Do the suite style bathrooms have custodians like the hallway style bathrooms do?,WWU,cz9e472,1,t5_2rjx9
7441439,0,t1_d2nuax9,Hello. Thank you for your amazing comment and genuine support. Im Asyas girlfriend and there is an overwhelming amount of support. Shes been getting messages from people she doesnt even know who the post has reached including the current AS president and Vice President. We both hope that administration is going to take action but this is all very scary at the same time. ,WWU,d2o1lex,12,t5_2rjx9
8685070,0,t3_4yxs30,Go to the wwu bookstore website and there is a spot for textbooks that you can look what textbook you need for what class. Usually prices are okay but not bad to get the ibsn and check on Amazon too. I know the chem book you have to buy from the bookstore though!,WWU,d6r9d8j,3,t5_2rjx9
