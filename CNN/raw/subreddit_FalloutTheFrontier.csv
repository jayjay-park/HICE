8765970,0,t1_d71738w,Great!How about a Vault ? A vault that was sponsored by MedTek its experiment was to no longer make radiation a threat to humanity. I imagine its a hypersterile environment filled with anything from HyperAdvanced AutoDocs to Stimdispersing gas masks to antiaging compounds for dwellers who have been visibly scarred from radiation aka prewar ghouls to experimental radiation vaccines which when taken outside of an intense radiation zone either kill them outright or make them extremely vulnerable to mutation like a ghoul accelerant. Thats one of my original ideas I dont wanna add anyone elses because I dont wanna look like Im stealing theirs AND because Im pretty certain the vaults are numbered lowest in the Northwest and highest in the Southeast of America.,FalloutTheFrontier,d71eq4n,1,t5_3f58a
