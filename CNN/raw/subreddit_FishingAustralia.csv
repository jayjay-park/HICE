287323,0,t1_cfa53sv,Ive only just got into fishing to be honest  Ive been heading out with a mate who runs a kayak fishing page actually. Hes very cluey and a great teacher so far. If you want to ask him anything hit him up at  or  Im sure hed be happy to show you a few spots he frequents too. Snapper does have a bad history but I made sure I wasnt heading anywhere I felt uncomfortable. I was with a group of  so that made it a little easier as they all go there pretty regularly. ,FishingAustralia,cfajmy8,1,t5_2sgvv
558082,0,t3_20isvp,i just lift the rod up and down doesnt have to be very fast just enough to make the jigs shine in the water. I find that as long as your hooks arent too big the baitfish will hook themselves.If youre only getting toad fish the water is probably too shallow.Ive use a sabiki rig for catching slimiesyakkas from a boat.  If youre on land you will need deep water like a rock shelf or a jetty.,FishingAustralia,cg3pldf,2,t5_2sgvv

9507538,0,t1_d9l03z3,Haha theyre the sessions you dont tell them about so they think you only go out occasionally but are a master fisherman Yep anywhere! All you need to do is vary the size for the conditions and the plastics for what youre chasing. You can get jig heads up to g and more with  long plastics so suit right down to g and little  plastics. Doesnt have to break the bank either. Just dont get sucked in when you visit a tackle shop!,FishingAustralia,d9l0907,3,t5_2sgvv
