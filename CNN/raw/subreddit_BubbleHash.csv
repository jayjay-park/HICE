4694327,0,t3_2w1rpf,Just a few questions? Why is it that you dont put ice in your work bag? Didnt realize it has any negative effects and the majority of major hash distributors have said that its actually quite helpful? What kind of ice shape works best? I have a friend who owns like a special spherical ice dispenser for whiskey so I was wondering if there is some strange shape that works best. Also is there any outlets for information that youve found particularly helpful outside of hands on experience? ,BubbleHash,ctm9ego,1,t5_2ydw1
