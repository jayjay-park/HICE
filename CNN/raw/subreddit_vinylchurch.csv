2244126,0,t3_2kvkh6,Spooky ToothSpooky Two LP   Picked up this Spooky Tooth album from a friend who works at a record shop a few hours away from my home. Rarely do I actually mail order an item but this one has eluded me long enough. Finally scored it due to a random conversation with them at a record convention!     I love that the record kicks off with a lengthy simple drum intro. Nothing to see here. Just playin some drums!,vinylchurch,clp2xew,1,t5_32ec4

3217257,0,t3_2wze3d,Joe CockerSelf Titled LP    Snagged myself a nice copy of this little rock and soul gem. Theres some really cool stuff happening on this slab. Perfect for party jams or just an around the house workhorse cleaning session. Feels good and gets the blood pumping. I will never forget the first time my mom asked me Have you ever heard Joe Cocker? She was also the first person to call me with the news of his passing away this year. Rest in Peace J.C. ,vinylchurch,covgxzn,1,t5_32ec4
3801039,0,t3_33gy6g,While it is no longer Wednesday I feel certain a post is acceptable! I got some new records yesterday and want to share one of them! Dave Brubeck  Jazz Impressions of Japan.  While I was familiar with Brubeck I was not familiar with this particular album. Each song has a correlating haikuesque poem with it thats geared toward capturing the essenceexperience of the band when they went to Japan. I drew a nice hot bath last night and settled in to give it a listen. The first song Tokyo Traffic was very fitting to the description. It was snappy and fast and all over the place. It did not really suit my lazy bathtub mood but I liked it none the less and thought maybe Id switch over to some Coltrane and then come back when I was in that particular mood.  The second song was much more mellow and suited my mood. It picked up again for the third but then Fujiyama came on to end side A and I was absolutely mesmerized. I played it again and again and again. So mellow and beautiful and amazing.  The snail does all he can  But oh it takes him quite a while  To climb great Fujisan,vinylchurch,cqpjr8p,2,t5_32ec4

4653016,0,t3_3ep81d,Melvins  Nude With Boots LP  Although I am already a Melvins fan even the dedicated will admit there is a risk taking element about this band that sometimes goes to far. Not this time though! They really nail it on this record. Unlike any of their previous material this is another reinvention of the band. IMO this is the Melvins take on the classic Led Zeppelin sound and is unique within the bands discography. Listen here,vinylchurch,cth2mtc,2,t5_32ec4
