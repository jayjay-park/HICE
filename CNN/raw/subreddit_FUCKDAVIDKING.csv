8464643,0,t3_4vjrou,Ill have to admit. After finishing series  I was a bit skeptical thinking there is no way series  would be as good as series . You know thats how it normally goes with second parts in filmsbooksstoriesetc.  But fucking hell how wrong you proved me.    Absolutely amazing series. Kept me thrilled for the whole time series  was as awesome as the first one.    You know a good story when youre sad when its finished. And that means a lot considering I miss a story about psychopaths now.    You did a great job Zander sorry Ill be calling you Zander if you dont mind and if you dont make a career in this then there is something seriously wrong with this world. But dont worry I bet you will do just fine. Hell I wouldnt be surprised if you were already busy with all the job offers etc.,FUCKDAVIDKING,d5zm8ds,1,t5_3fafr

10711885,0,t3_5ev625,Man idk how you remember everything and keep up with what has been said or not. Like when it comes to series of events and especially all the info about the credit and things of that nature. But I loved this story. Saw one slip up well two but the one I remember is when Clark says she was writing the whole time and now I know it was part  on Reddit then almost immediately she states out loud she wrote to the audience telling them she Sophie was ending their lives. Other than that you kept up and didnt slip up at all. Kudos !! ,FUCKDAVIDKING,ddkumzn,1,t5_3fafr
11542417,0,t1_dg3wo61,Haha! Good luck with that promotion. Ive mostly written to small writing prompts on the writingpromts. A lot of them were done in one quick sitting and dont really have any effort into formatting or proofreading. my biggest weakness or at least one of them A friend of mine suggested trying short stories before trying anything like a novel or anything and I figured trying a few different genres at least would attempt to flex an unused muscle.  though still dont think Im that good of a writer xD.So below are some of the ones ive responded to. Either found it interesting or had a spur of the moment to write. Or I picked it cus it sounded fun. ,FUCKDAVIDKING,dg4c25l,1,t5_3fafr
