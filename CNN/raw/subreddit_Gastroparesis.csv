1703868,0,t1_cjtx139,No prob.  The Bathroom Burn is the one that annoyed me the most.  Not because of the pain but because its the symptom that a doctor should have immediately recognized as undigested carbohydrates from a damaged GI tract.  That amount of information would have been enough to steer me towards diet a little sooner.Good luck with lowFODMAP if you decide to give that a go.  Id like to hear how it works for someone else.,Gastroparesis,cjtxnip,1,t5_2usbg
2771068,0,t1_cnj1x5c,My GP is not severe just enough to get diagnosed and a few severe flare ups a year so I wouldnt take it working for me as a thing that rules out your stomach being the culprit! I think vyanese is different to Adderall and Ritalin so if it isnt your stomach that one is probably your best bet. ,Gastroparesis,cnj26kh,1,t5_2usbg
5248410,0,t3_3mvmry,What? Get a new GI doc. You had an emptying test that showed you have GP and your new doc is just denying science? What?? Your symptoms are textbook GP.,Gastroparesis,cvimeu7,3,t5_2usbg

7942544,0,t3_4kjw2u,Its hellish isnt it?  And no amount of words from people can help.  I cant imagine what its like for the other person.  My fiancee has watched me suffer for  years.  Hang in there man.I think thinks are getting better then whoosh Im in a total fuck the world mood for days.  Like just now,Gastroparesis,d48tdy8,1,t5_2usbg

9515039,0,t3_5b0pte,Sorry to hear your having trouble was diagnosed with gp a year ago my dr doesnt think thats the whole solution so hes beginning to look at my intestines Idk if youve had issue with yours too since they do go hand in hand but it might be a place to look,Gastroparesis,d9lxjg7,2,t5_2usbg
10076056,0,t1_dbkqcwi,No I am very thankful for all this info! I want to know others experiences so I can get idea Of what I might need to do with my future. I will mention though which though Ive been diagnosed with it I find this odd after reading about everyone else who has it I havent had any nausea or vomiting at all yet. I dont know if thats because my symptoms are mild? I have experienced a ton of weight loss in my hands arms feet and legs so far that started about a month ago. And for someone that is only  pounds thats pretty significant. I have already been taking omperazolsodium bicarbonate for the acid build up I have from my gastritis and taking two in the morning seems to help for most of the day not sure if its treating my gastritis or this or both. Can I ask you where you get your Domperidome? And how did it change your eating habits? My doctor recommended that for me. I am just concerned about the side effects I read that it can build up in your kidneys and liver and could cause sudden cardiac arrest. Though Ive finally been diagnosed with this I still am in the process of trying to diagnose my bladder contracting issue and my intense right flank pain could be kidney or liver?. Anyways I believe that if Im having both stomach contracting issues and bladder contracting issues Then my other organs may not be working properly including my heart kidneys and liver. I dont want to take a medication that might end up really hurting me until I have gotten completely checked out and made sure that all my other organs are working properly. Sorry now Im rambling haha. Im just scared I guess especially because my masters program is sooo stressful and so time consuming. This semester Im expected to work  hours a week for Practicum over  hours a week in class and then do the mountain of homework they assign every week. Its nice to have the same professors as last semester but that also means I know how tough its going to be again like last semester. I love what I am doing and I love working toward this degree but it hasnt been easy for me especially with other mental health issues. But yes I will look into a psychologist. I used to see one but with my previous insurance it wouldnt cover it. This semester I signed up for school insurance so I will be able to afford one again. Thank goodness. Hopefully that will help. Edit though I havent had nausea or vomiting I am still experiencing some common symptoms abdominal paintenderness bloating with most meals a lot of burping gassy honestly I just thought it was my gastritis acting up so I started taking two of the omperazolsodium bicarbonate in the mornings and that cleared it up for most of the day. ,Gastroparesis,dbkxjkd,1,t5_2usbg
