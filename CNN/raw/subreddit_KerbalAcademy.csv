44203,0,t3_1uln50,for best results stick with the prograde marker. delete the maneuver node when youre about ms away from completing it then watch your orbit in map view while you drop the throttle. Kill engines when it looks like what you want.Maneuver nodes assume that you can instantly change the ships velocity vector. With short burns you can get fairly close compared to the effects of orbital dynamics however as your burn time grows lower acceleration or higher V burns this approximation becomes less and less correct.For this reason I find it preferable to stick with the appropriate sigil rather than the maneuver node especially for burns longer than s or so.As an example try to create a maneuver with a normal burn which performs a  degree plane change.. you cant do it and your apoapsis goes nuts! however if you point normal and burn then follow normal as it shifts youll get there eventually. yes I know its more efficient to point retrograde and reverse the orbit this defeats the purpose of this exercise,KerbalAcademy,cejgpd5,2,t5_2wrxb

145348,0,t1_ceuhl3k,gt The amount of fuel needed to lift something exponentially grows if you increase the payload massIt does not. A lot of people confuse whats exponential in the rocket equation and whats not. You just solved the rocket equation and got payloadfuelCdry the C part is a constant. Quite clearly this is a linear relationship.Alternatively suppose you have a rocket that gets some amount of payload in orbit. You want to double the payload. You can just launch two rockets to get double the payload. Or three rockets for three times the payload. Clearly a linear relationship.Whats exponential is the amount of fuel needed with respect to deltav. But if you just want more payload deltav stays the same.,KerbalAcademy,ceuziia,3,t5_2wrxb

Each applies some amount of torque on the rocket but these torques cancel each other out.

Once you have KAC go to the ship thats has a long wait until its next maneuver and use KAC to create an alarm shortly before the maneuver time make sure to account for the amount of lead time necessary since a minute burn should actually start  minute before the node time plus a few seconds are needed to align your heading and such.Once the alarm is set return to the space center and crank up the time warp to maximum. KAC will automatically scale back the time warp is your next alarm approaches and stop the warp entirely while presenting you a little reminder.

2380185,0,t3_2mnpfh,Are you using any mods? You mention having a heat shield. Now dont get me wrong mods increase the fun challenge and replayability of the game however they do depending on the mod also increase the difficulty.Are you using RSS? That mod specifically increases dramatically the amount of dV deltav you need to get into orbit. Try removing it if you do and see if you get better luck getting into orbit.You might also try installing a mod to see details of your craft as youre building it. I recommend Kerbal Engineer or MechJeb MechJeb can do much more for you ie. fly your craft but if youre not into that it can also just sit back and throw back information at you. That way you can see how much TWR thrust to weight ratio and dV you have for each stage.Once youve built a sound craft with .k dV with an initial TWR of around  at least for your first stage later stages can have a lower TWR since youre not fighting against gravityair soup as much you should be ready to launch.For a simple ascent profile try going straight up at about  ms until you hit around m. Once you get to K rotate your craft so your heading is at  degrees turn right and pitch to  degrees midway between completely horizontal and pointing straight up. This isnt the most efficient way of climbing and doesnt work with aerodynamism overhaul mods like NEAR or FAR but it will get you to orbit. Burn at max thrust until your apoapsis is at your target say KM and shut down your engines.Then set a manoeuver node at your apoapsis to circularize. Simply move the prograde marker until your periapsis is over the atmosphere and matches your apoapsis getting them close can be hard so dont worry about perfection. Once your manoeuver node is setup point your craft to the blue manoeuver indicator on your navball and start burning when the time left before the manoeuver node is half of your total estimated burn time basically youre burning half before the node and the other half after the node. This should get you circularized! Now for landing. This tends to take a lot of practice but try and set up a manoeuver node to burn retrograde backwards. This shouldnt take more than a few hundred dV. Now remember that the atmosphere is going to slow you down so try and aim farther than your target. Once youre happy with your manoeuver node coast to it and do your burn as above. Stage your parachutes when you get close to waterland and make sure your craft is facing the retrograde marker and time warp is disabled to lower the risk of the chutes simply tearing off.Wait until you touch down and recover your craft. Youve now sent a rocket to orbit and safely landed it back down .,KerbalAcademy,cm5wdl0,4,t5_2wrxb

3029603,0,t1_cobtia8,Well I actually tried this out. I think I mentioned somewhere else in this thread about taking a probe up and making sure its angular velocity doesnt dissipate as someone else suggested. Well I also put a separatron at one end to deliver an impulsive torque around another axis to see what would happen...Im not entirely sure what should be expected. I saw something similar to gyroscopic precession... The ship I used was a probe core with some long slender structural parts extending on either side and two of the radial separators at one end. I got it spinning pretty fast around the longitudinal axis first and then fired a separatron. You seem to suggest that this would cause the probe to flip end over end while continuing to spin. This doesnt happen.Is gyroscopic precession exactly what were looking for though? The examples that come to mind are like the videos that you linked and those all have to do with balancing the constant force of gravity. Youve got angular momentum in the spinning object thats being constantly redirected to balance the torque introduced by gravity. The impulsive torque from the separatron is not quite the same thing and Im struggling to picture the difference between the scenarios.A few other observations... You have to have SAS off or angular momentum dissipates. It seems that you have to keep the probe charged which is a little quirky when the probe runs out of charge the momentum dissipates obviously thats not realistic cant figure why the code might work that way. If you get the thing spinning and let it go it does eventually a few minutes later start to wobble slightly without any other changes. Someone else has claimed that KSP doesnt do gravitational gradients gravity only acts through the ship COM rather than on each part if thats true I can see how it might be a rounding issue. I had two separatrons on either side at the top and fired them both while spinning to get those results... I fired one of them to test how the ship would react to the impulsive force. Thats when I get the precession. The ship keeps spinning apparently as fast as it did before but it wobbles around what appears to be the axis of the resultant angular momentum. In this case the spin does noticeably slow down over time. But as it does the wobble increases. It almost makes me think that the angular momentum is being conserved... that its just being shifted around. I cant think why this would happen... But I dont see anything like it when theres just spin or when theres just flipping from a separatron. Only when I do both.,KerbalAcademy,coc0l0e,2,t5_2wrxb

This is super easy to do and not so easy to notice.When you are attaching a part to a radial decoupler you need to have your mouse pointer directly over the the decoupler when you attach it.  It doesnt matter where you grab it from and the constraint means that you can really only place the part so the decoupler attaches to the middle of it.  You can offset it later with the offset tool however.I usually check from the top and side views to make sure the parts are attached to decouplers properly.  If the booster is directly against the side of the main ship its not on the decpupler.  There should be a visible gap between the stacks.,KerbalAcademy,cvx98do,4,t5_2wrxb

5518805,0,t1_cwgxayo,gt Can you explain the Q stuff more? Ive never seen any write ups anywhere or youtubes that talk about atmospheric pressure clearly.Aerodynamic effects such as lift and drag and frame stresses all have a natural physical scaling based on the dynamic pressure.  This is related to Bernoullis principle but the upshot is that the dynamic pressure is given by half the atmospheric density times velocity squared orgtgt Q  amprho vAtmospheric density decreases with altitude velocity increases as you go faster.  Since we start out in dense atmosphere at  velocity and end up in vacuum at a really high velocity somewhere along the line we experience a point of maxQ after which it decreases.gt  Are you saying it is more costeffective to carry extra deltav up to space than needed to complete the mission?Theres vehicle cost if youre fundsconstrained.  Theres also partcount for similar reasons.Also not all profiles are as easy to fly.  A nearlyunstable rocket that gets to orbit at  ms may in fact be worthless if one wrong control input will cause it to tumble whereas a stable rocket that takes  ms might be able to reach orbit with SAS off and no hands on the control inputs save to stage.Also dont forget time to orbit.  You cant really timewarp during launch so an ideal profile that circularizes halfway around Kerbin from the launchsite will take  or so minutes to go from launchtoorbit and from there you can start the interesting part of the mission.,KerbalAcademy,cwh2sqb,1,t5_2wrxb

5804941,0,t3_3up5dr,Are you running out of fuel too early or just having a hard time understanding how to circularize the orbit?If you are running out of fuel early I have another question. When you launch your rocket do you fire straight up or are you adjusting your launch path overtime to slowly come in line with the horizon line? Because if you are firing straight up you exit atmosphere quickly but then have to burn a ton of fuel to circularize which could be an issue.If its an issue circularizing let me try and explain without using any special terms. As you are flying out of the atmosphere once you get close to that high point you point yourself towards the horizon in the direction you are traveling and burn till you get it to at least roughly be a circle. Then if you need to adjust one of the sides of the circle wait till you are on the opposite side of the circle that you want to adjust. Burning towards the direction you are going will raise the height of the opposite side and burning away from that direction will lower it.I hope that helps a bit. I tried to stay away from terms that may confuse some of the new players. At the same time I do suggest to watch a few more videos about it since you will hear these terms over and over as you learn the game.,KerbalAcademy,cxgnoqb,2,t5_2wrxb

6489758,0,t1_czqijvq,Im no expert but I completed a similar mission this week where I saved  kerbals from different orbits.  What I did to get to each craft quicker was to keep either my apoapsis or periapsis in line with the target orbit and raise or lower the other one in order to catch upslow down enough to meet it.  The trick is to take a note of how much closer you get with each rotation and to adjust that value until your target separation is divisible by that amount.  For example if my target is km behind me I raise the apoapsis enough that in one orbit the separation at closest approach decreases by a nice number like  or  km.  Then I know I can make  or  quick orbits and then make my fine adjustments to get in under m or wherever youre comfortable.  Determining how far to set my apoapsis to get km closer per orbit isnt something Ive gotten to a science but a little bit of trial and error usually gets me close enough in a couple of quickloads.  Also keep in mind that these values are arbitrary.  If I was km away Id try to get  or  km closer every orbit.  Just something even.  I hope this helps.,KerbalAcademy,czql8au,1,t5_2wrxb

8200210,0,t3_4qum34,Budgeting Part  Transfers with Plane ChangesIn this part well cover the last thing on uCuriousMetaphors V map the maximum possible plane change values between bodies that orbit in different planes. After Ive described how those numbers were derived well combine that with the techniques that we covered in Part part to develop complete budgets for transfers to Moho and Dres.part Ill be freely using the visviva equation introduced in Part part and the specificorbitalenergy equation introduced in Part part so you may need to refer to those parts during these examples.part  The basics Changing inclinationIf were not already orbiting in the same plane as our destination well usually need to make an inclination change to set up a good encounter. The simplest way to make an inclination change is to burn normal at one of the locations where our current plane intersects the target plane. Thats all the ascending node and descending node are the places where two orbital planes intersect.If you want to change inclination without changing your speed so your other orbital elements are the same in the new plane then the size of the burn is equal to your orbital speed times twice the sine of half the angle between the old and new velocity vectors vvsin. The derivation of this formula involves diagrams that I cant replicate to my satisfaction in ASCII art so for the present Im forced to leave it as an exercise for the reader.The direction of this ideal planechange burn is halfway between your initial and final normal vectors. Since maneuver nodes use the reference frame of your orbit before the node youll have to add a retrograde component to your node to get the vector you need. If you do the entire burn in the direction that the maneuver node thinks of as normal that direction will have a potentiallyunwanted prograde component in the new reference frame.The angle  between the old and new velocity vectors is fairly complicated to calculate in general but if our vertical speed is zero because were at apoapsis or periapsis or because our orbit is circular then  reduces to the relative inclination between the old and new orbital planes. Well have the luxury of using the easy case for all of our calculations.Because the cost of a planechange burn is proportional to our current speed the worstcase scenario is for the node to fall right at the periapsis of our transfer orbit where our speed is the highest. Well use our speed at periapsis to calculate the worstcase budget that goes on the map.If you use a porkchop plotter like Launch Window Planneralexmoon or Transfer Window Plannertwp you may notice that many of the good transfer windows happen when one of the nodes coincides with your arrival or departure. This is no accident. Adding a normal component to an arrival or departure burn is usually cheaper than making a separate normal burn. The math is again more complicated than Id like to cover here so Ill stick to the simple worstcase calculations in the examples here.alexmoon twp  A note on the examplesThe orbits of Moho and Dres are both quite far from circular so the actual cost of transferring to them will depend on where on their orbits we meet them. Since our goal in these examples is to calculate typical numbers that could go on a map well assume that we meet them midway between their apoapsis and periapsis i.e. at a radius equal to their semimajor axis. By making this assumption we can do our calculations the same way we did when the origin and destination orbits were both circular.However according to this commentauthorsnote ucuriousmetaphor did use the worstcase positions of the bodies to calculate the maximum plane change value. If we want to exactly replicate the published map well need to calculate two transfer orbits one at the destination planets average radius to calculate the average ejection and insertion burns and another using the radius thats farthest from Kerbins e.g. Mohos periapsis and Dress apoapsis to find the worstcase speed for the plane change calculation.authorsnote  Example  Moho Find the transfer orbitTransfer apoapsis is at Kerbins SMA of  km. Average transfer periapsis is at Mohos SMA of  km. That makes the SMA for an average transfer  km. Sun  is . ms. Solve the visviva equation for the speeds at the apsides . ms at apoapsis and . ms at periapsis. Compute Kerbin ejectionKerbins speed relative to the Sun is . ms giving us a relative speed at SoI crossing of . ms. With that relative speed the SoI radius of  km and Kerbins  of .mswe find that we need a specific orbital energy of  Jkg to exit the SoI onto a Moho transfer. Plug that energy figure and the km parkingorbit radius back into the equation and solve for the speed at that altitude . ms. Subtracting the circularorbit speed of . ms were left with an ejection burn of . ms. Compute Moho insertionAt a radius equal to its SMA Moho is moving at . ms giving us a relative speed at SoI crossing of . ms. Moho has an SoI radius of . km and a  of .ms putting our specific orbital energy at SoI entry at  Jkg. Well capture at a radius of  km  km body radius and  km altitude. That energy value at  km gives us a speed of . ms. We decelerate to the circularorbit speed of . ms for a burn of . ms. Compute worstcase plane changeRecalculate the transfer orbit with a periapsis equal to Mohos periapsis of  km. We get a worstcase speed at periapsis of  ms relative to the sun. Moho is inclined  degrees from the KerbinSunMn plane. Applying the equation vv sin  we get a worstcase plane change of . ms. Round to the nearest  ms to reproduce the published value of  ms. Example  Dres Find the transfer orbitPutting the apoapsis of the transfer orbit at Dress SMA of  km with periapsis at Kerbin we get a transfer SMA of  km. The visviva equation gives speeds of . ms at periapsis and . ms at apoapsis. Compute Kerbin ejectionOur needed speed of . ms at Sun periapsis corresponds to . ms relative to Kerbin at SoI crossing for a required specific orbital energy of  Jkg. To get that energy at parkingorbit radius well need a speed of . ms which is a burn of . ms relative to a circular orbit. Compute Dres insertionAt arrival with radius from the sun equal to its SMA Dres is moving at . ms. That makes . ms our relative speed at the SoI boundary. SoI radius is  km and  is .ms. Using those values we compute our specific orbital energy as  Jkg. Periapsis will be at a radius of  km  km body radius plus  km altitude. Our specific orbital energy gives us a speed at periapsis of . ms. Circular orbit at this radius is . ms giving a burn of . ms to circularize. Compute worstcase plane changeRecalculate the transfer orbit keeping the periapsis at Kerbin but raising the apoapsis to Dress apoapsis of  km. In this worstcase condition the transfer SMA is  km. With the worstcase SMA our speed at periapsis is . ms. At this speed the degree relative inclination will cost . ms. Again rounding to the nearest  ms reproduces the value on the map. ConclusionIn this series Ive demonstrated how I would calculate every number on uCuriousMetaphors V map replicating several of the published numbers along the way. Youve seen all of the tools you need to construct a similar map for any planetary system and any scale that you may find yourself playing in. Good luck and fly safe!,KerbalAcademy,d52kw2e,3,t5_2wrxb

11057887,0,t3_5xvms5,The two numbers that matter most for flight planning are TWR and deltav.  Things like mass fuel consumption payload fraction etc. all affect those numbers.TWR is important to consider to ensure you can fly a profile and do it efficiently.  When you are launching or landing the TWR is a major consideration.  If its too low then the craft will be incapable of flying properly or waste too much deltav to gravity losses.  If its too high it means you are dragging around too much weight in engines.  In space the same principals apply but you typically have a lot more time to complete burns.Deltav gives you a rough idea of where your craft can get to.  Every maneuver has an associated deltav cost and you can add up the required maneuvers to see how things can play out.  Deltav maps are particularly useful for this but keep in mind that they assume fairly optimal execution so its best to overprovision.Planning efficient maneuvers is also something you generally want to do.  Knowing how to use the oberth effect when to plan transfers how to use course corrections where to execute plane changes etc.  Ultimately it boils down to a deltav cost for each maneuver.  A less efficient one will cost more deltav to achieve the same effect.I would definitely recommend mods like kerbal engineer and transfer window planner.

11269899,0,t3_60s5z5,gt Its a fairly big payload so Im assuming it needs a big rocket.You might consider splitting the payload into multiple modules which can be launched separately with considerably smaller rockets and assembled in orbit or even after landing.Also try to minimise your part count use a few large enginesbatteriessolar panelsetc rather than lots of small ones. Flexing only happens at joints between parts so if there are fewer parts there are fewer places to flex at.,KerbalAcademy,df9fcz9,1,t5_2wrxb
11333396,0,t3_61mlhx,Heres another ascent profile worth trying Have a launchpad TWR of gt  and a very streamlined rocket i.e. use a nice pointy fairing A pair of steerable tail fins is a very good idea though not absolutely essential. Ignite the engines and immediately tip over to  degrees. Ascend at  degrees until apoapsis is about km at that point you can follow prograde.This kind of ascent profile is extremely economical in terms of fuel used about ms to orbit potentially even under ms because it builds horizontal velocity with utmost efficiency though the high launchpad TWR makes it expensive in engines. But you can achieve the high launchpad TWR by bolting on clusters of hammers or thumpers as you only need the high TWR for the first s or so. The TwinBoar engine also produces thrust unusually cheaply.Btw this is not a realistic ascent profile for rockets IRL fuel tends to be a lot cheaper than engines so the tendency is to pile almost as much fuel onto the engines as they can lift and having a high TWR comes at a significant cost in contrast fuel is surprisingly expensive in KSP. Also Kerbal rockets are a good deal sturdier than real rockets so you can ram them through the atmosphere with much greater force. Mainly I prefer the  degree ascent profile because its faster to get into orbit and less effort. To do an ideal gravity turn with a low TWR rocket generally requires repeated launches of the same rocket to get a feel for its handling in contrast with a high TWR streamlined rocket a  degree ascent will always be ideal so its ideal for noreverts gameplay. When exploiting Thumpers to get the high launchpad TWR it also tends to be the cheapest way to get payloads into orbit other than recovery of TwinBoar based launchers.Final thing to note is that the ideal gravity turn generally assumes a rocket with a launchpad TWR of .. if your TWR is higher you should start the gravity turn sooner like with a TWR of . youd probably start tipping on the launchpad and with even higher TWR you can start with the rocket tilted by the time TWR is . you should definitely be doing a  degree ascent.,KerbalAcademy,dfgmczb,3,t5_2wrxb
11372889,0,t3_6267iv,I really like seeing the plots on the Launch Window Planner website. The other tools give optimal trips but sometimes there are  trips that arent far off optimal that will happen sooner. It also gives an idea of whether the window will be pretty forgiving in exact departure date. ,KerbalAcademy,dfl3gu8,3,t5_2wrxb
11486385,0,t3_63y9q9,Are you stopping your injection burn at a munar periapsis of  km?  If not youre massively inefficient the circularization to LMO should be a single burn about  ms to get into an elliptical orbit and  more to circularize low.,KerbalAcademy,dfxzaqo,6,t5_2wrxb
11510998,0,t3_64al44,You definitely want to uninstall either sve or eve. I recommend keeping sve but thats a personal preference. Other than that increase all graphics settings in the main menu. Also the dark night sky is due to distant object enhancements. It makes the sky totally black when youre in the sun as would be the case irl. I believe you can change the settings do it doesnt do that.  Planet shine could also have a part in it but I cant remember now if it also does that. ,KerbalAcademy,dg0rulk,2,t5_2wrxb
11541975,0,t1_dg3epry,Oh so actually Ore tanks are heavier than the common LFO tanks per unit fuel. I think. I think this is what my thinking was partially based on. But the difference is pretty insignificant it depends on the tank and it depends on which fuel. For some tanksfuels Ore would technically be better.,KerbalAcademy,dg4a96x,1,t5_2wrxb
11591609,0,t3_65fko0,So Im confused... you have CommNet switched off as difficulty your probe died and so your solution is to put up a CommNet?Unless youre wrong about the CommNet setting that wont fix anything.  Maybe pics of the probe preferably with the resources tab showing electric charge and such.  Make sure the solar panels arent blocked by something.,KerbalAcademy,dg9x0yu,5,t5_2wrxb

11796160,0,t3_68acg6,You want to arrive at the target planet near your solar apoapsis if target planet is farther from the Sun or periapsis if closer to the Sun.  Its at this point where your velocity relative to the Sun will be most similar and so it requires less delta v to capture.,KerbalAcademy,dgx4v79,2,t5_2wrxb
