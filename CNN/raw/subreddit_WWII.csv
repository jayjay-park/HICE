I have one for my great uncle who was killed in action on Okinawa. It doesnt detail the exact circumstances surrounding his death but in your case it may be possible that there are due to the fact it was a homicide rather than a combatrelated death. See this link which explains how to obtain one  It notes that it can take  months to receive it once it is requested.

3607209,0,t1_cq33da2,gtwhat do you make of this? Its irrefutable that the Nazis had developed a systemic organized means of killing Jews.The issue is that because many Jews were either outright murdered or simply worked to death the overt point of concentration camps was primarily labor people like to play fast and loose to make the appearance of a farce when there is none. Its also worth mentioning that the Nazis intentionally produced some nonsense documentaries to give the false impression of a clean operation. Movies like this one are worth watching so that you can learn to be sensitive for propaganda one of the most common tactics any Holocaust denier will employ is to supply facts woven in between halffacts or outright lies to give the false stuff an inaccurate sense of truth. You would not believe how many times these two pictureshave been used to justify something the Nazis did as propaganda and photo editing. ,WWII,cq3g4s9,1,t5_2r4qh

11328629,0,t1_dffy0v5,Yes! Much as I love the characterdriven story of Infinite Warfares Reyes Id be keen for COD to go back to having multiple protagonists fighting different parts of one war and showing how different events shaped the overall outcome of the war. Picture this Youre playing as an American Corporal. You and your squad are taking part in the siege Bastone. History plays out Americans take the town.As the player you then take the role of a British Sergeant during an earlyyears SAS stealth operation to take out an experimental weapons system being tested in the fort of AubinNeufchteau in Lige less than KM north of Bastogne. Enemy morale is visibly lowered as a result of the nearby loss at the hands of the American forces. Enemies are noticibly more jumpy and react more quickly to any noise you may make or they may be more hesitant to investigate due to their fear. Itd be a really interesting and cool way of showing that what you are doing has real effects on the enemy soldiers.,WWII,dfg2xkz,1,t5_2r4qh

11719611,0,t3_67828k,Why people are not understanding is that the WWII flyer that leaked offers a VAGUE explanation of the coop mode. It says high octane which is just and adjective for the type of gameplay well get. It is definitely not the name of the coop mode. It also says its a new and original story and its has adrenalinepumping moments all of which can apply to Zombies. Of course it could as well be a fully new mode and I think Id prefer that only because we should have original unique modes instead of Zombies each year. But people shouldnt outright assume that the description means no Zombies. Also thinking that DLC  is a replacement in order to compensate for no Zombies makes no sense. Why would they have to compensate for that? Theyve had games without Zombies before and didnt have to compensate. People shouldnt expect Zombies EVERY YEAR. ,WWII,dgog304,1,t5_2r4qh

11785707,0,t3_6855vj,A number of these things would be nice for consoles too. Vsync tearing gtgt input lag.  A option works for either preference. FOV  I dont mind whatever CoDs default is but I prefer .  I dont care if we lose a few frames with higher values.  CoD runs well on consoles normally so I dont even think it would be much of an issue anyway. Ping numbers I dont know why console games dont use this.  It gives better information and just colorcoding the numbers would do the same thing as bars. Disable aim smoothing or add an option.  Its been one of the bigger issues gimping controller aiming. Crossplatform  This would be really cool.  I know the whole MampKB vs controller thing but if controllerconsole users got deadzone aim smoothing acceleration curve and ADS sensitivity options it wouldnt be as bad as most people would think.  With aim assist it wouldnt even be an issue for the most partBlops  PC players had issues with controller aim assist.  If nothing else crossplay zombies andor campaign would work great.,WWII,dgvy68m,3,t5_2r4qh

11808891,0,t3_68homr,Players should get sample access to all dlc packs ahead of time similar to a demo or beta. The beta period will be  days. It will take place  weeks ahead of retail release for all packs.The player not on a season pass is given the option to purchase the pack in the beta or preorder the pack or upgrade to season pass.The season pass can continue as normal but must have a new way of incentivizing the player upon purchase. Exclusive camo or substantial in game currency or XP bonuses and the player will be able to continue playing the packs indefinitely after the beta concludes. Any non season pass holder electing to buy the pass is immediately eligible for rewards.Players who opt not to purchase a season pass are left with with an option to purchase individual packs having experienced the dlc pack.This would fix season passes as the player is no longer left with a blind buy so to speak and become a better consumer practice. It should also hold the studio to better standards for their products.Pricing structure is negotiable but should be fair as compared to similar packages.It may sound complex but an interface like this isnt difficult for them.,WWII,dgykuho,1,t5_2r4qh
