3774579,0,t1_cnhh5bg,heres what i do and its proven. when you and the volcano are ready leave the chamber on the volcano for  seconds then but the bag on and fill. this lets it get a bit warm before you start the fan. ,VolcanoVaporizer,cqmj2zx,1,t5_2tljh
3842569,0,t1_cqu82e5,Im sure that the problem would be easy enough to fix but for a couple bucks more you could get a brand spankin new set up or a slightly used one if you keep your eye open over at rentexchange . A big draw to the volcano for me was ease of use low maintenance and how thoroughly it vapes my goodies. With the issues you mentioned ease of use and maintenance go out the window.  isnt enough for me. Again take this with a grain of salt just my personal opinion. Cheers on whatever you decide and welcome to the Volcano Club if you grab one!,VolcanoVaporizer,cquabzy,2,t5_2tljh
5463538,0,t1_cw9p3hm,Yeah I started barely pushing the plunger and I think Im getting better results. And I LOOOOVED the easy valve set up but had to get rid of my first volcano with it a while back and just got this new volcano off eBay that came with a solid valve. Its only been two weeks and my plunger thing pretty damn dirty and sticky. Plus I hate accidentally touching it when its hot. ,VolcanoVaporizer,cwa0o91,2,t5_2tljh

11458998,0,t1_dfumoqv,Its better for your lungs and mouth to vaporize rather than smoke joints or bowls. By a tremendous amount. ,VolcanoVaporizer,dfuvbkr,1,t5_2tljh
