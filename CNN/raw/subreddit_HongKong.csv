486719,0,t1_cfvixub,gt why are all of Asias best cities so insanely expensive?I like this question.Part of it is that these surveys are run by businesses and generally look at executive expat lifestyles as opposed to local ones.  This is an interesting concept that doesnt apply to a lot of Anglophone cities in those places you dont see concentrated groups of wealthy immigrants segregating themselves from local populations.  Thinking back to my hometown of LA the closest you got were the Japanese dominated areas that were mostly staffed by car company employees like Torrance but even then theyd still send their kids to local schools as opposed to paying for international schools and all that.  Then again that explains Hong Kong and Singapore pretty well but I think makes less sense for a city like Tokyo which I think is mostly just expensive because most of Japans wealth is concentrated there similar to Pariss relationship with France.  In conclusion Asia is a land of contrasts.  ,HongKong,cfvldq1,6,t5_2rbn0

810874,0,t3_2398jz,Well its pretty hard to find a Food related Job that goes for that kind of money as a fresh graduate. Usually those salary rates go for those with  years of full time experience but you can always try to ask for that price.Also there are a few companies that you do not want to work for Maxims is one of the biggest food factories in Hong Kong but they are extremely harsh on their workers with lower than average pay and OT hours that are high even in Hong Kong. If its nutrition you are after and dont mind doing sales you may want to try Watsons. They have a nutritionist position which also promotes sales of certain products. I think they also get commission from each sales  your base salary so it should be over k. You may also find it beneficial to do a Food Hygiene Certificate for Hygiene Managers Certificate in Hong Kong. It will give you a better chance of landing those better jobs. Many of the institutes like IVE have good connects with the food industry so if you can somehow get to know the lecturers they can give you insider information on which companies have openings.Living is also a problem because the rent in HK is extremely high so you may want to try to find a roommate or live with friends or family if you do decide to come backI probably should have introduced myself first....

The courts were adamant on keeping the rights of the people to convey any message they wanted as long as the message was conveyed appropriately.All Occupy Central needs to do is to tell the commissioner they will be planning such an event. I think even then the commissioner can reject the event but only when it jeopardizes public safety and the rights of others.

1163893,0,t1_ci0jotj,Youre right. Im not questioning the factual accuracy of what he is reporting. Actually like you said its the way he chose those facts that is frustrating. Each of those constructions projects was a landmark achievement in its own way and there is a wealth of either positive or neutral information on each. When you decide to throw up a few photos and only one or two sentences of text and the facts you chose are primarily critical or negative its nothing short of biased.For example the BOC building.  points listed two of which are critical bad Feng Shui locals think it looks like funeral incense. Aside from the usual specter of workers rights violations he must have searched hard to even find those two bullets. The only thing he has to say about the incredible ICC building is that  workers died. However as if needing to switch sides in order to find something to complain about he brings up the green mesh cladding on the Innovation tower which as far as I know is still not completed. First workers rights being violated by a rush for a beautiful tower and then aesthetics being violated by worker safety measures. The bigger picture is that even in title Hong Wrong has a tendency to criticize the city far more often than it finds cause to compliment it.

As long as HK is a part of China what the OP article said about HK is going to hold true.   country  sets of law.  HK remains capitalistic and China is socialistic.  What is the possible alternative?  And China would definitely want to keep hk capitalistic because thats where money comes in.  Maybe you should consider your argument is a fallacy fallacy.  My main point was everyone wants money.  A simple statement.  The protest might not be ABOUT money but as individual do they want money?  Yes.  So does the Chinese government.  Its not that hard to understand the PRC is trying to make money and with that they are going to keep HK capitalistic and make HK prosper.  The benefactor WILL be PRC if HK is doing well.  There is absolutely no reason for PRC to want HK to suffer.  The HK people?  That I cant say.  People protesting about June th is not even relevant to what I am trying to convey.  I am simply saying that greed is behind everything.  And wow you sure like twisting peoples word.  I am saying China is opening up its economy more and more and will be getting more internet freedom.  Its inevitable. ,HongKong,ci3xcp1,-5,t5_2rbn0

1379516,0,t1_cip3kf4,Insensitivity and freedom are two different things. Actually in this case they are opposite things. True freedom of speech only exists where people respect your right to express yourselves even when they find the content of your expression despicable.Take flag burning for example almost every country in the world has banned it except the notable exception of the US.  In U.S. v. Eichman the US Supreme Court ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution it is unconstitutional for a government whether federal state or municipality to prohibit the desecration of a flag due to its status as symbolic speech. That is free speech. That is true freedom.I can see how some Hong Kongers might find the Gizmodo thing offensive but if newspapers censored everything that might offend someone then theyd print nothing of substance.

Sideeffects for me were dry skin dry lips hair strands were thinner almost no sweat in the dead heat of summer some dry eyes zero oil on face which was fantastic and no suicidal thoughts. It is pricey however so make sure you prepare for it. Cant stop the course once started. Owing to the sometimes severe sideeffects he will of course ask you why youd want a prescription. So youll need to say that youve tried everything  creams diet topical medication like Retinol but none has worked. So you absolutely want to try Occutane.

Should be able to get it easily on the web with some googling.Then I recommend  Colloquial Cantonese andor A Cantonese BookBasic Cantonese A Grammar and Workbook theres also a Intermediate Cantonese one for laterAnd then as needed and depending on your level the Cantonese books from here  I think they also put them in certain book stores in HK you will probably have to askHonestly though if you can spare the time I would highly recommend you to take at least one or two hours of lessons a week from a real teachers. Friends and colleagues are helpful enough but they are not trained teachers. Especially if you have zero background in Chinese and are just starting when it comes to the finer details of pronunciation and grammar you will need a teacher if youre serious about it. And you definitely do not want to focus on that later. Its the very foundation for everything that comes after. Often its what missing when Cantonese learners in HK complain that theyve been studying so hard yet are never understood. Selfstudy can be almost dangerous and counterproductive as a beginner because youll be subconsciously forming bad habits that are more difficult to get rid of later.I highly recommend CUHKs Chinese Language Center. They offer evening classes in TST as well.

SO then I talk about how  ok lets put it this way in  something its a different time since being critical of the government at that time meant most likely theyre communist sympathizer which meant you had the potential of creating home made bombs in trying to cause social unrest and kill police.

While the HK government dont have that precursor to act in this way.

3815652,0,t3_3440wm,You cant deny that Hong Kongers are in fact very antimainland. I studied in an international school and our education focused quite a bit on racism  how slurs like nigger or chink can be used as weapons to hurt others how its dangerous to generalize an entire race as being on way or another. Thats why Im always surprised to hear my friends say things like Mainlanders in Sha Tin are SO annoying! I always hear people swapping stories about rude Main landers theyve seen on the MTR. Can you imagine if we talked about black people or jewish people in the same way?  I remember accidentally bumping into someone in Disneyland and having them say you must be a Mainlander! as if that was an insult. Im not happy with the Chinese government either I dont like how the country is run I dont like its systems Im also so depressed about how one country two systems is being ignored. Ive been annoyed by Mainland tourists too. But there is a difference between hating one particular tourist on the MTR and hating an entire race. tldr HKers are very antimainland.

As a tourist in Hong Kong he said people treated him worse when he spoke Mandarin than when he spoke English.  He also said people in Guangzhou were nicer to him than in Hong Kong presumably because he spoke Mandarin.  This was interesting because as a nonCantonese speaking white American Ive found Hong Kong residents to be far more nice and polite than Guangzhou residents.

Its very reasonably priced the people who run it are actually quite friendly shock and some of the food is excellent.I would highly recommend the Macau Giant Panda Pavilion. Its by no means a full day out as theres really only the panda and a few animals outside but its well worth a trip. Its only a few minutes down the road by taxi or bus from the Cotai strip and entry is only  HKDMOP. You buy a ticket to a one hour slot and then you can enter the pavilion to see the panda for as much as you want in that hour.

4277860,0,t3_39z2sm,Bandwagoning on this post to get some personal travel suggestions and maybe condense down the Google doc recommendations a bit. Sightseeing and FAQs in the next posts hopefully.Getting to and from Hong Kong. Plane  probably how most visitors come to HK. Hong Kong International Airport is wellconnected and has airlines between basically nearly all major countries within  hours worth of flying barring transfers. Some other regional airports to consider would be Shenzhen and Guangzhou but HK is a hub in itself.. Train  somewhat underrated option. If youre in China itself or want to head out to China HKs Hung Hom station referred to as Jiulong or  station on the mainland is the final stop for many intercity trains in China. There are also direct trains to Guangzhou numerous times daily from Hung Hom making for an easy day trip into Mainland China.. Boat  most people already know about the MacauHK highspeed and regular speed ferries but HK also has ferry links to many cities around the Pearl river Delta in Guangdong Province. Packing tips for Hong Kong  HK has a hot and humid climate during the summer time which can be very uncomfortable. Bring a few extra shirts if you plan on changing shirts more than once a day.  Insect season starts picking up when the rainy season hit around midApril up until the weather cools down around October. If you are prone to mosquito bites bring repellant or purchase some in HK at any convenience store Watsons or Mannings. For insect bite relief I personally prefer Mopidick and similar types of rollon liquid itch relief that use menthol. Air conditioning is heavily utilized during the summer some malls and stores have a temperature difference of more than  degrees Celsius from the outside. Bring a windbreaker to put on when indoors if you are sensitive to sudden temperature changes. Carry an umbrella with you at all times during the summer. Sudden short showers happen regularly and umbrellas can be used to provide shade in sunny areas. During the winter months DecemberMarch the weather is dry and breezy and falls to a moderate  degrees. Medium to light jackets and hoodies are suited for this time. HK uses  voltage and  prong UKstyled plugs Bring adapters as necessary or purchase them when you arrive. They are widely available especially in areas like Sham Shui Po or even Temple Street. Prescription medication is not widely available in HK. Bring enough supply of medication for the entirety of your trip otherwise you will have to visit a clinic wait for a doctors appointment then fill your  prescription at the clinic. OTC medicine is available in both Watsons and Mannings.What to have on your person while sightseeing Cash HK is a very cash based society with a large number of traditional familyowned restaurants taking cash exclusively. You will also need cash to buy street food shop in the night markets or street markets in Stanley and Mongkok. ATMs are widespread. Octopus Contactless payment card akin to a debitbank card. This card is used for almost all forms of public transportation in Hong Kong and is also accepted is basically any major chain store restaurant fast food chain etc. Just tap the cardyour wallet to the reader and wait for the doot sound at which point it will flash your remaining balance on the screen. Theres a fuller list of places where you can reload the card with cash on the website but off the top of my head you can reload at Starbucks McDonalds WatsonsMannings any supermarket or any convenience store Circle KVanguard. The card has a stored base value of  HKD so you can go up to negative  HKD in a single transaction. Cards with a preexisting negative balance will be declined by the reader. The card can be purchased at the service counter in any MTR station including the airport. Passport Carrying identification is required by law and police will ask for ID if you are stopped for any reason.Getting around Hong Kong. MTR Everyone loveshates the MTR which is HKs subway system. It spans across the small territory and is fast reliable and blessedly airconditioned with a breeze. Downside is that it can get VERY crowded during peak commute hours and weekends. The subway will go between districts and exits are clearly marked with both sightseeing destinations and major buildings and destinations. Fare is relatively inexpensive costing up to  HKD for the longest journey one way.. Doubledecker buses Countless bus lines crisscross Hong Kong and provide a cheap way to get around the city or reach areas that are not accessible by subway for example Sai Kung the southern side of HK Island and Aberdeen and Eastern Kowloon Whampoa To Kwa Wan and Ho Man Tin. Stops are displayed in both Chinese and English on screens inside the bus but older buses may simply do computerized announcements in Cantonese Mandarin and English. Fares are cheaper than the MTR when traveling long distances but travel time is longer due to traffic. Fare is paid by tagging your octopus or paying cash when boarding.. Green minibuses Wherever the doubledecker buses wont go the green minibuses will. These buses have somewhat shorter routes than the larger buses but are definitely intended for more local use. The fare is comparable to the larger buses but each bus sits a maximum of  people and will only take on additional passengers when there are empty spaces. While they do follow set routes check the streets it travels along there are few set stops other than at the start and end points. Green minibuses are usually flagged down wherever they are able to stop similar to taxis then pay the set fare when you board then take a seat. When you are approaching your stop call out to the driver to stop the bus Driver stop please or  tsin biin yau lok. I dont recommend this option for tourists unless absolutely necessary because it is difficult to know where your desired stop is as drivers rarely speak in English and do not announce stops. If you must take the minibus I recommend showing the driver the location where you are getting off and also keeping track of location via GPS to see when you are close enough to the exit Google Maps has indicated.. Red minibuses Disclaimer I have never taken a red minibus. The easiest way to explain the red minibus is the idea of a shared taxi. They travel within one neighborhooddistrict and can be flagged down like their green counterparts. However they have no set route and generally do NOT take Octopus cards. As you board you tell the driver where you want to go and they will start routing towards your destination along with the other passengers and will stop in front of your destination.. Ferries HK has numerous outlying islands to travel to as well as the iconic Star Ferry The Star Ferry is the cheapest way to cross the harbour soak in some views of the skyline and feel the ocean breeze. Ferries to the outlying islands as well as Lantau leave from the Central Pier and are reasonably priced per single journey. Simply tag your Octopus as you pass through the fare gates. Note that springing for first class is usually not necessary but they do have slightly nicer amenities like air conditioning in the heat an indoor cabin in the rain and access to vending machines and tables.. Taxis HKs taxis are cheap and plentiful. There are three kinds of taxis red for within the main parts of the city like Kowloon and HK Island blue taxis serve Lantau Island green taxis operate in the New Territories. Note that taxis DO NOT take Octopus cards or credit cards sadly.Sightseeing in the next post.,HongKong,cs7u0tw,41,t5_2rbn0

In these clinics they provide contraception for free or low cost but its limited to what they offer which does not include implants however seems to include the shot.

Yes the British were one of the lesser evils among governments of the latter th century either third world slumlords or communists but I wouldnt forget that for many years Chinese werent allowed to live at Victoria Peak and that there was a racial class system the legacy of which persists today with HKs simple minded worship of white people. A lot of the more positive aspects of British rule were only put in place towards its end partially as a means of whitewashing their colonial legacy because pretty much every other former British colony was quite unpleasant to look at which is partly why Hong Kong was exceptionally well developed for a British colony though it was mostly because its proximity to locked down China meant the place was automatically rolling in cash anyway. However people who worked with my dad since the s have told me that in their childhood in the s it wasnt uncommon to deal with corruption in everyday life i.e the postman withholding mail and demanding a bribe.All in all the fact that the British were competent has been great for Hong Kong.

Persons who adopt a radically different culture do not speak the language come from a privileged economic class and isolate themselves in a social and dating bubble can only be very thinly argued to be HKers or representative of Hong Kong in general.This literally describes almost every immigrant community in Western countries including Hong Kong people or Italian people or Jews or Sikhs or Indians etc! in for example Vancouver and Toronto.

It is my strong suspicion that caucasians represent a much larger share of the overall rugby playing population than the general demographics would suggest.

There are probably only two possibilities here either the kid got his conversion rates mixed up or he was drunk outta his mind but neither makes any sense and I will explain why.The kid was staying at the Harbour Plaza Metropolis so its not like he was some rich brat staying at the Four Seasons. Which means when he exchanged for some Hong Kong dollars at the airport it wouldnt have been more than k  k. So he had to have known how much k is worth approximately in Swiss Francs. There is no way he would hand over a huge chunk of money he just exchanged to a taxi driver for a cab ride. No way.If he was super fucked up and still managed to go through immigration the customs exchange his money line up for a cab tell the cab driver where he is staying and hand over k at the end of the ride its super unlikely he would just suddenly sober up at the hotel counter right after he jumped out of the cab.I also question whether any taxi drivers would be stupid enough to ask for k especially when the passenger was staying at a hotel. Even if the passenger was a dumb fuck and believed him how would he know he had the money on him? If the kid didnt have enough money and had to ask the front desk for help the driver wouldve had to high tail outta there and lose the few hundred bucks he earned.TLDR Somethings fucky.

5706306,0,t1_cx4bs42,First of all thank you for your indepth reply I think it was very insightful having this discussion. I have to admit that the downvotes dont make me feel that well but I think it is productive to know how you feel about the issue thanks.Back to the arguement I never said that they are totally the same I just advocated to the opinion that Hong Kong is highly under the influence of China and that by dismissing Hong Kong as part of China without thinking through the points I will address them in due time will lead to a statement in which I think is flawed.Political structure Yes it is different and I do admit it in my last post and added it is because of the administrative framework imposed to Hong Kong by the handover.Education teaching of several languages is different yes but I would beg to differ on your statement on history. In fact Hong Kong does omit large parts of early colonial history in primary school years having grown up here and receiving local education I can confirm that General Studies textbooks dont address early colonial history issues such as racial divide and British prejudice against local citizens. I would argue that every education does omit history to favour their own government and that it is not special to China or Hong Kong. In that sense China and Hong Kong are not that different.Food I dont know whether you have been to China or not but in big cities such as Shanghai the variety of food definitely is comparable or even more wider than that of HOng Kong. Also you shouldnt compare Hong Kong to some third or fourth tier Chinese cities as it is an unfair comparison.Business ethics morality and lawabidingness Just because you dont see it doesnt mean it doesnt exist. When you make statements such as HKers think about ethics and mainlanders do not you are taking a small sample size which you were able to observe and generalizing for all in that group. I would say that both groups contain people who think for ethics and those who dont and the situation isnt as onesided as most people would have thought.Anyway thanks for your contribution and I welcome further discussion ,HongKong,cx4f8as,2,t5_2rbn0

The reason you get a lot of local people rooting for college teams is because American football is HUGELY popular but not every statecity has a professional team.

Its even viable to the free world that this Hongkong be sacrificed should it mean a democratic China. This is a fact. It is just wrapped up as the SinoBritish Joint Declaration and the description of Hongkong as a gateway to China proves that Hongkong being unique and freedomyearning as any country in the free world is seen only as a sacrifice to hopefully bring into the free world fold a larger nation.

Could TVB took another approach by for example not showing it at all which is also in the managements discretion. I dont think deleting the subtitles was a political consideration. Theyre showing you the goddamn clip man do you really need the subtitles to see whats going on?gtI went through the trouble of listing all the Canadian articles on Saudi Arabia First of all half of what you listed were comments. They were not articles. Second of all the article from Cheah argues that the western media and to some extent governments had not been portraying Chinese leaders in a neutral light. There had been a crackdown in corruption economic reforms that are aimed at increasing domestic consumption instead of relying on exports and strengthened claims on outlying islands that are backed by historic records. But the west is so caught up in human rights issues that theyve completely neglected all the other problems China has to deal with as well.

This interpretation is different to those earlier interpretations in that it does not interpret the law but lays down an extensive set of entirely new requirements. Ergo it should have been promulgated as an Annex III law and the mode used by the NPCSC does not follow the Basic Law and is unconstitutional.Nonetheless the Hong Kong courts will now follow this interpretation because unlike Beijing they have some respect for HK and the system we have here and they realise that to defy the interpretation will inflame the situation.Article  of the Basic Law invokes referrals by the HK court before making their final judgments which are not appealable. So this does in fact appear in the laws of Hong Kong. If you care to read what I wrote above I was describing how this matter was a within the scope of HKs autonomy and b had not proceeded to the final appellate level so there was no reason to refer it. This is also why there was no need for the NPCSC to get involved.But please ignore facts and reason and insult me personally again.

Isnt SGs press even more muzzled than Hong Kongs?Another thing that struck me as odd is while the SG land forces are relatively evenly mixed racially speaking citizens of Cambodian extraction are barred from becoming fighter jet pilots.

11294933,1,t1_dfc5741,HKers need to behave better before any change occurs. Many are rude pushy ignorant people. The mainland people dont want to see HK destroyed but they are envious of the system in HK that provides safe food and some regulations that let people feel secure. HK is based on pure capitalism. Full stop. It is the system HK wanted. It is a system that allows shop keepers to make good money. The opportunity for wealth is astounding in HK. Since thats the system HK wants the people should shut their mouths about mainlanders coming to HK and spending money. Thats how the system works best. Then lets discuss the domestic helper treatment by HKers. Disgusting how these helpers are marginalized and basically treated like animals. Ive spent a lot of time in both Mainland and HK. Both sides have problems but since everyone is generalizing on the whole mainlanders are less educated and HKers are snobby rude adult children. Both sides need to grow up.,HongKong,dfc9iz2,-1,t5_2rbn0

11487945,0,t1_dfrc74s,I think it is because Hong Kong tourism is still staying on a level that is outdated or with a specific term third world peasant oriented. Now most tourists from developed countries go back to nature and enjoy classical beauty from historical buildings and places while Hong Kongs taste got drag down by mainland market not only tourism movies and music too. Remember in the old age our grandpa and grandma like to go to big cities to travel to see skyscrapers big cars and materialistic lifestyle but it is not the case for most first world tourists now. This is also why beside mainlanders Hong Kong could always attract lots of south east Asian. After the peak of golden era of Hong Kong in the s it was supposed to raise up into a more completed first world quality city like Europe and Japan focus more on building a strong community democracy environmental more socialism and promote creativity instead of socalled Lion Mountain value sweatshop working attitude more humanitarian instead of working as mortgage robot music and movies or any other art form should have been weirder and more experimental more great people of scientific or artistic sector raise up. We saw the potential of Hong Kong could have been we saw another transcendent era of Japan Korea and Taiwan after successful democratic reformation but we got drag down by politic and low morale. Instead of improving we saw all the thing that listed above are diminishing in our beloved city. The political conflict that is happening nowaday is the peoples reaction to the mainland drag down. ,HongKong,dfy5o88,2,t5_2rbn0
