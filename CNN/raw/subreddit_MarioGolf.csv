10177173,0,t3_5i9pdo,Toadstool Tour. Has a lot of features and I felt that its physics  controls made it very easy to replay. Also connectivity to Advance Tour really helped expand the game.World Tour is a close second but it removed a lot of features Highlights normal Tournaments etc. and controls that Toadstool Tour and Advance Tour had for some reason. Also if online support is removed down the road will be hard to get back into it in comparison to Toadstool Tour.,MarioGolf,dbxn05p,1,t5_2vk3g
