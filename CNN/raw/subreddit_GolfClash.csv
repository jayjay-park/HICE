11426688,0,t3_633xb3,I mean the Apocalypse driver I think is the best but you probably dont have that.  I would use the Extra mile if I were you.I like the sniper level  over the viper.  Big Dawg level  is good too.  I like backbonesaturn over goliath but sometimes you need the goliath for playoff holes.  Skewer wedge over dart.  Razor rough iron over machete. and upgrade your sand wedge,GolfClash,dfr7by2,1,t5_3ioqe

11579031,0,t1_dg0whlv,I dont like Tour  either.  If you mishit your drive and end up in the rough or sand you will lose  of the time because you cant makeup the distance.  Most people are forced to play it though because of the amount of coins to play Tour  k per game.Tour  has a BIG issue with freezing and game crashes without being able to rejoin on Facebook and Gameroom.  I probably lost k in coins just because of crashes.,GolfClash,dg8hmy3,2,t5_3ioqe
