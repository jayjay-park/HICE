5826263,0,t1_cxjafkk,True but Ryu isnt necessarily losing a stock for making a technical mistake Little Mac possibly can so Id say Little Mac is perhaps more  technically unforgiving. P,LittleMacMains,cxjck3r,1,t5_38j24
6360348,0,t1_czcc4zr,Ill try switching up my controller scheme and had no idea about the specifics on short doublejumps. I use NoTapJump and standard everything else so switching up might help.Also I dont mean the footstool one i mean the Dair on missed Tech. Ill try those out when I get home i had been doing it late a lot.,LittleMacMains,czclmus,1,t5_38j24

7606624,0,t1_d2pn1gc,Its worth noting that the windbox can be used to LMs advantage given proper circumstances. It can let LM close the window on Link even faster Using the windbox to approach with a smash attack can neutralize nongrab attacks making it a safeish approach.Just be careful of the inevitable hookshot to counter it jolt haymaker does the trick,LittleMacMains,d36u0la,2,t5_38j24
7788245,0,t3_4lui9g,Falcon main here. If the little mac dash attacks my shield and I grab him its over.  down tilt past  and a soft knee to kill your momentum or make you counter fling yourself under the stage. You will not come back. Hell I can do that at .The advantage of super armor is strong. Very strong. Falcon has no projectiles nor tether grab. We have speed and aggressive combos. Literally the only way I fight little macs is throwing them off stage and keeping them off stage. Macs can counter in the middle of a combo or just spam smash attacks. Both work well I think. Ftilt too. That thing is fucking dangerous. Other than that just keep falcon in the air and dash attack wherever you think he is going to land. If he goes for edge spam dsmash.I dont fear the ko punch at all but some falcons develop a defenive playstyle when the ko punch is ready to go. Falcon aint supposed to be defensive. He needs momentum and pressure when fighting someone equal in speed. Mac can take advantage of that.Of course Im biased. Listen mac mains. If you have proper spacing you can dominate this match up. However if you space wrong and we get a grab in one chain is all thats required to take your stock. Dont be salty plz.,LittleMacMains,d3rgepn,3,t5_38j24
