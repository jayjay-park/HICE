38182,0,t3_1ujq96,This really stands out to megt We want to keep the number of mods as low as possible with still being able to stay on top of everything. Why would you want that? Furthermore I dont think that being on top of things with a low mod count is possible. You want to have an overlap in mods so you have people active around the day and when someone cant spend time modding for some reason others will be able to fill without having to resort to extreme measures. Anyway to answer your question A mod that without notice has very few mod actions in two month period or so. ,modclub,ceis0qn,11,t5_2t610

735617,0,t1_cgnkrun,It would be nice to stop having to hack CSS scaffolding elements into the sidebar with Markdown. Its ridiculous. But I am not sure that simply adding an invisible markup container is a viable solution all on its own. Itd be nice to get closer to raw HTML in this markup container but there are security and other concerns with that. For now though I think that its the best fix we have and we can patch it with a larger sidebar until it gets implemented.I agree with simple domain bans. Itd be nice to be able to manually add simple rules like that to the spam filter. Really simple rules.It would be nice if there were better ways to share CSS and images. One of the things Im currently writing for the SFWPN is a bot to clone a subreddits CSS including copying images from one subreddit to another since we have to maintain gt subreddits with  the same stylesheet. I ran into a couple hangups a while back and got sidetracked so its not done yet but I hope to get it running soon.A thought I had would be to support subredditlevel import statements in the stylesheets. So I could import rsfwpncss in all the Network subreddits and have it automatically rewrite the correct import rule. In order to prevent abuse I think youd need to be able to control what subs can import a subs CSS. Have the option to have it private with a whitelist or public with a blacklist.So this would give mods the ability to really easily grab common public themes for their subreddits and switch between them. It would also lighten the load for subreddit networks that share CSS.,modclub,cgnw6e7,1,t5_2t610

4519480,1,t1_ct098sh,gt Why would a shadow ban be better than a visible user ban for such activity?The problem with banning all users equally is that for subs that trolls flock to they simply ban evade.  They make a fresh account when they see theyve been banned to continue spoiling insulting and demeaning.  Shadowbans dont outright prevent this but they help a lot in that respect.  Personally I tend to use the standard ban when a strenuous warning is needed or after multiple warnings so they can appealget a strong message that they have crossed a line.  But when a user continues to break the rules after that or does something so heinous that they no longer have a place in this community a shadowban gets rid of them better than a regular ban where they can just make a fresh account to continue doing what they were doing.,modclub,ct0bnb4,0,t5_2t610

9757095,0,t1_dafpd38,I thank you for the welcome uwikilr.gtyou need to know that to encourage users to post you have to put up some new content once in a while and make it a hub for people to visit  whether for support or just sharing things about the game.Ill keep this portion in mind as I place content in the subreddit. I have a few posts in mind to liven up the place other than the  default ones currently up.gtNext is CSS  for anyone signed out or casually stumbling upon your sub at least put up a relevant image helps identify it.Im not too familiar with how CSS works but I can modify an alreadyavailable one to suit my needs so thank you for the link to rthemes.gtNext is reaching out to similar subreddit mods to help promote your sub  game. It also doesnt hurt to mention it to offsite pages.Ill keep this in mind as I help to grow the subreddit though at the moment I have no one in mind that can help with this. Im sure thatll change in the coming months however.gtNow the hard part the popularity and activity of a sub depends on how much people like the content. Some subs grow large in an instant some remain small like ours but be patient and itll turn just fine.I have no difficulty with remaining patient for a subreddit such as this as Im not expecting it to grow large like say rwarframe and rgames but to be kept small as its not a wellknown series.gtOptional Set simple default rules visible on the sidebar. You can write an extended one on the wikipage. This will help foster  shape the community and untangle future kerfuffles. Careful not to make it too longcomplicated that may discourage others from posting.There are a set of rules already available on the sidebar but Ill see to placing them in a spot thats more visible. I havent considered using the wiki to place extended rules at since Im not too familiar with it but Ill look into it and definitely not make rules too long or confusing.gtGet automod rautomoderator he can help with moderating amp scheduling posts.AutoMod can certainly help with moderating as a whole but since the sub is fresh and not exactly active he wont be used much.
