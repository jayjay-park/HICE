555896,0,t1_cg3aetw,Nope Big Red came from the Hoffmans. And the only problem with going to Scribner creek is that he would not be close to his ailing grandfather.,goldrush,cg3gmy8,1,t5_2t8d7
718162,0,t1_cglw2ds,Yeah its confusing. He acts like theyre going to get heavy equipment up there or something why not worry about if its profitable with the equipment they have now?And that other guy John I think is really annoying with his tantrums. They should just fire his ass it makes it unbearable to watch.,goldrush,cglwpup,2,t5_2t8d7
1025535,0,t1_chisqbf,Well that is your opinion ... I personally have had worse managers than Todd so you get what you get...if you wanna top them....I would love a series where you go up to beat their ass.,goldrush,chkuymd,0,t5_2t8d7

5478826,0,t1_cw5qm04,if thats  million and he pulled  milllion out of the ground that leaves like a million in profit after Tony gets paid.......OFC that would be if you could believe discoveries gold counts........IDK if you cant run a business on a million in profit you are kinda fucked in just about any industry.......,goldrush,cwbyytx,2,t5_2t8d7

6453995,0,t3_441b21,You must admit though the Hoffman crew allowed so much shit in the first few seasons to happen and it didnt really phase them. Like what was Guyana all about?! Maybe hes finally getting his act together that hes a boss and not a friend.,goldrush,czmvvgp,1,t5_2t8d7
6464348,0,t1_czi5807,Its probably why they stick with him. They know hes just a broken dozer away from a full on meltdown ,goldrush,cznyi61,1,t5_2t8d7
6607241,0,t1_czyi3em,right by now i can see the size of the jar and guess what it is just from watching the show. Hell to even believe that they actually only do  clean out then weigh the shit is funny. Most mines I know of do a clean out every  hours not once a week. But once a week looks good on the tv no?,goldrush,d02qt1w,2,t5_2t8d7
6732712,0,t1_d0fk4sr,They do that with a lot of shows.  Axe Men comes to mind where you are comparing Apples and Oranges.  Dont mind it on Deadliest Catch so much as the amount of crab caught is what pays out.  And on Deadliest they also tell what the actual crew share is.,goldrush,d0fpz3g,7,t5_2t8d7
6741331,0,t3_47p8up,So it looks like most of the gold there is still attached to quartz are they going to need further processing to separate it?,goldrush,d0gm0rg,1,t5_2t8d7
6813553,0,t3_491ufw,The real question as to who won is unknown since Tony talked about the expense to get the gold.  So it you had more gold ounces but spent more to get it out of the ground did you really win?  I would really like to know the bottom line Profit AFTER expense to see who had the BEST operation.  Discovery Channel DC just treats this as more gold  the winner.  Maybe as we the audience become educated as the seasons of Gold Rush continue DC will start to talk about the expense....but I doubt it,goldrush,d0om3jf,7,t5_2t8d7
6816093,0,t1_d0owc5b,Yeah I dont get Dave. Hes gotta be dumb Todd suckered him in for  remember? Freddy is the shit. He got big ass nuggets with his brother when they went to Carmax or whatever. I forgot about Dakota Fred was reading another thread. Did him and his son kill themselves on that mountain top?,goldrush,d0owh1j,1,t5_2t8d7

9605570,0,t1_d9x2dxf,I suspect that info is wrong theyre certainly giving the impression that theyve been working it for several weeks if not months. Especially with how much dirt theyve moved around their plant Id say weeks might be right. They undoubtedly play up and edit some things for the drama but  hours would be less than a single week of running the plant. Trying to stretch it out that much risks a nasty backlash from viewers. ,goldrush,d9x306i,7,t5_2t8d7
