6775416,0,t1_d0jvczm,Of course its relevant. People like you make complaints like these all the time about white people producing media that mainly feature white people. The same way that when you imagine characters they often look like yourself or the people around you which I presume is nonwhite from your response the creator of this game is going to be more likely to dream up characters that are similar to himself. The reason why its important that he made the game himself is because there was only one persons creative experience involved. Its also important because unlike in other media where people of color are less likely to get involved because they have to be hired first by mainly white people who consciously or subconsciously tend to select other white people there are no barriers with indie games like these. There is nothing stopping you or people like you from sitting down and making the game of your dreams. This kind of criticism is much more understandable when its on gamesshows which have creative teams of  people and they still cant between them create an authentic and diverse cast.You only had to talk to the characters Ive mentioned a few times to establish their backstory not necessarily pursue them romantically or are you saying that you arent even speaking to anyone in the game because they are mainly white? I brought up that Maru is mixed race because you called her black but technically she is mixed race. My understanding is that some mixed race people choose to identify as blackasianarabic etc some are proud of being mixed race etc.. so the distinction seemed important. I dont think that the creator put those characters in there for the sake of diversity thats the point I expect he just imagined that the towns scientist was a black man called Demetrius and that his daughter would be a mixed race nerd who works as a nurse. And while you cant date them Gus and Jas dont look white to me. I never said it was uncomfortable to have a mix of races in the game nobody here is saying that what makes people uncomfortable is when you jam in a token x racegendersexuality character to meet a quota in order to avoid criticism. When a character has been unnaturally inserted into media because the creator is scared of the backlash if they havent represented every configuration of human and the characters created that way also tend to be underdevelopedstereotypical then it does feel forced and uncomfortable. In large studio games there is literally no excuse because you can and should be hiring a diverse pool of talent who can contribute their own experiences and creativity which will naturally mean a broader choice of characters and perspectives this is literally one guy working from his bedroom. People have been leaving this game poor reviews because they feel like the characters arent diverse enough while completely ignoring the immense achievement that this game is for a single human being to create without funding. On top of that its the first of this genre to allow same sex relationships and one of only a handful to let your character resemble whatever race you want and thats considering that the previous games created in this genre were made by large studios who still didnt manage to allow the player to even have that much freedom. Of course you are free to complain as much as you want about this game and yes I agree that it would have been an improvement if the characters reflected real life if it were to reflect the demographics of the USA only  of the  characters would have been white instead of  I just dont think its fair to trash this game in reviews and elsewhere for having a failing in that area when it is otherwise such an accomplishment.,StardewValley,d0k9z3u,1,t5_2wb7y

6782389,0,t1_d0l1pmk,I dont have any recording software and i cant remember how to make gifs Ive only made one and that was years ago.What happens is this. I fill up my inventory while viewing the contents of the chest. I then pick up something out of the chest and press a outside of the chest and inventory window. The item then appears back in the chest seemingly as it was but if I move something from my inventory back to the chest the stack I threw away also appears in my inventory doubling the amount of whatever item I just threw out of the chest. This can be repeated infinitely.If you try to do this exploit and move the duplicated itemstack to the chest from your inventory rather than the other way round you lose the entire stack except for one of that item. So for those who want to abuse this bug do so carefully else youre gonna be wasting your own time.Personally I would leave it in if enough people ask for it to be left in its not a game breaking bug as far as i can see and its easily avoidable. Hell you can even actively get back the correct number you should have if you accidentally trigger this bug.EDIT To create multiple stacks you will need more than one chest. The number goes back to  once it passes .,StardewValley,d0l2hz1,1,t5_2wb7y

If an animal doesnt return to its coopbarn at the end of the day then at night you should go into the building exit then go back inthe missing critter should be in there.  You should close the door at night it makes them feel happier and more secure.  Dont open the door on rainy or gusty days.  Always keep their fodder tray full even if you let them outside to forage.  If they dont find any grass during the day theyll eat from their fodder tray overnight.  I kept the door closed all winter and they were fine.  ,StardewValley,d0lyqm2,2,t5_2wb7y

6820481,0,t1_d0pcaap,Well tessellation means tiling without any gaps so the idea is that you can keep adding those units to cover all the space. But it definitely does cause some weirdness with edges which you can either fill in with other stuff like your design does or just do partial units with a scarecrow slightly out of position. I like your design though!Edit But I was saying it was soulless because its optimization nearly to the max more so than a grid layout.

You can easily reach far enough in the mines to get access to the monsters that drop it and along the way youll pick up bits and pieces from destroying rocks the minecarts and bags that have several pieces in and youll also get loadsa geodes which often have a few pieces of coal in them.You can also unlock the charcoal kiln recipe that turns  pieces of wood into  piece of coal which is a good deal since one tree gives more than  wood.Think if you are really desperate Clint sells coal too but Im not sure on that one as Ive never had to buy stuff like that from him.,StardewValley,d0r030z,2,t5_2wb7y

6855834,0,t3_49nfm0,Yes this would be wonderful! My whole thing in these types of games is not only am I making my ingame life better but my actions are making the entire town happier I want others in my town to experience the joy of sharing their life with their very special somebody too!And I think itd be awesome if its not always the same person. I know it would be simplest to implement it so that the people marry their dance partners from the spring dance once your player kinda goads them into it. But it shouldnt be too much more work to put in several events that will build relationship points between  other people. For example without the events Hailey and Alex will get married but say youre talking to Leah one day and shes upset because she wants more people to see her sculptures. Well youve seen Hailey out with her camera so you set them up for a sculpture photoshoot and they get friendship points and there could be more events to either support their growing relationship so eventually Leah and Hailey get married and move in together. I just think itd be a lot more interesting to have it semirandomized in that way.,StardewValley,d0tf0xy,8,t5_2wb7y

Vita is my main platform but I did just get my desktop fixed expensive! so if this ever comes out for vita I am absolutely  buying it but for now I cannot afford but want to play it so I can stream it and experience what everyone else is experiencing.

JamPickes are made obsolete even before you start them because of the insane cost to build them compared to kegs and you unlock kegs like a season later probably maybe  if youre unlucky. There really needs to be an up and down side to Kegs vs Preserves JarsPreserves Jar really needs a cost reduction. I mean  Wood   Stones and  Coal is a lot compared to  wood  copper bar  iron bar and  clay. Or at least it seems that way to me...

6951552,0,t1_d13m0oa,gt As others have pointed out they are merciless in trying to drive out small business from Pelican Town. Not only are their products except for seeds cheaper than Pierres their store is open every day of the week and for more hours. Now you may say Well thats business! May the best man win! There is some truth in that but think of reallife example WalMart. They go into towns destroy any small businesses there and then base their entire business model on keeping their new workers poor so that they keep shopping there.Your other counterarguments are solid but I think this one is pretty weak. I am not willing to say that the company is evil just because they are competing against other businesses. What are they supposed to do deliberately make themselves less attractive than their competitor? Collude with Pierre to keep prices fixed? The first would make them stupid and the second would actually be evil so neither is a realistic alternative.There are some times they cross the line notably when the manager comes into Pierres and hops aboard the predatory pricing train but for the most part they are frankly just outcompeting Pierre. Thats not evil thats business. Now they could conceivably use that as a stepping stone to do bad things in the future but the game doesnt elaborate on that.,StardewValley,d14ah6p,2,t5_2wb7y

Theres a few reasons one being comfort starting on one end of a field with a horse and ending on the other side then having to come back is a bother. Short trips on horse to the end is also kind of a pain and slows down progress and the other being the fact that Linnie tends to get stuck between my sprinklers and fencing a lot. Or how about a lead we can put on our horse to make them follow us with a x hitbox? Just throwing ideas out there.Also would it be possible to prioritize tending to animals before checking status?

Steps for Reproduction Have full inventory. Go to chest. Open chest. Remove something from your inventory like a rock and place the chest item in your inventory. Close loot window.

Later on you will realize you should have kept certain things or tried harder to grow certain things and will have to wait until next year to get them again.Its just how the learning experience goes your first time through unless you really want to look everything up ahead of time. Kinda ruins the experience though IMO.In general terms you can probably sell most of each crop you grow stuff you forage and fish you catch and save everything else until you have a better idea of what you will need.

Stacks of starfruit seeds omni geodes ores tasty food my weapon...Its no setback you cant overcome though.Personally I dislike the Obsidian Edge. Its slow speed makes it very difficult to juggle enemies by knocking them back or time attacks against flying pests which I find much more important for survival than high damage.

7108711,0,t1_d1lqb8n,I agree. But perhaps a means of encouraging singles youre not interested in to spend more time together. Say when youre at  hearts with someone you can get occasional this is my love life cutscenes where you can pick whether to encourage or discourage them from protoromantic activities with another NPC.For example say you get a cutscene with Elliott. He says that Penny has suggested creating a reading group and asked him to help organise it. Should he start a reading group with her? And then you can give him advice. If youre interested in either him or Penny you can say something like but then you wont have enough time to write. Better leave Penny to it. Or if youre not interested and think theyd be cute together you could say Thats a great idea its good that you two have this in common! Or if you get to a certain heart level with Penny before Elliott you have a similar exchange with her about whether she should ask Elliott to help with the reading group.As your heart level grows with each NPC you get more of these. Ultimately once youve encouraged enough events they start dating and then you get a time limit but if you continually discourage them they stay single forever.That way you dont have to rush into anything and can control the pace at which romantic stuff happens between NPCs.,StardewValley,d1m5f1w,2,t5_2wb7y

Placeable outside For me this is a clear case of Why the heck not?I also dont know the ConcernedApes stance  is on this specific area of the game but the limitation was surely implemented with a thought behind it. If its really a limitation which should prevail i would refurbish at least a small amount of wooden garden furniture you would expect outdoor so no leather armchair outside. I would be totally fine with that.Bottom line is It would change the creative freedom ALOT if you would just allow every furniture piece outside just so people have full freedom and no limitations.I bet alot people also dont know that you can place all kinds of items outside Like planting fruittrees in town or creating stone paths in the wilderness etc.   Freedom is already there but outside furniture would be the dot on the i Sry for wallotext thought i just spill my mind.,StardewValley,d1veejo,6,t5_2wb7y

7220959,0,t3_4ebpng,Unlike Harvest Moon Seasons are  days long. You should build a silo first before chopping the grass on your farm. The top half of the west wall perfectly fits  silos. You only need  flower to fuel multiple beehives. Planting a bunch around a few beehives does not add anything so maximize beehive space instead of flowers. Fruits are the most profitable crops hands down. Spring strawberries and rhubarb. Summer blueberries and starfruit. Fall cranberries and sweet gem berries. Once you get the greenhouse its Ancient Fruit. For the previous reason make as many kegs as you can. Putting fruits in kegs is significantly more profitable than preserve jars. Your characters gender does not matter  you can marry whichever of the eligible NPCs you want. Your wedding does NOT make you lose a work day. When the season changes to summer or fall any leftover crops will become dead plants that you have to cut with the sickle. This is actually a good thing because this saves you time to till the ground and it takes up a space to prevent weeds rocks or branches from spawning there. When the season changes to winter everything goes away including grass. The sickle does NOT consume energy. All tool upgrades take  days. For this reason it is best to upgrade the watering can when it will rain the next day or on the th since you will probably not water anything on the th. Dont forget to water your crops on the day you give the watering can to Clint and on the day you receive it back. You may have seen posts about how to maximize scarecrow placements. Dont be afraid to make multiple scarecrows  they are cheap to make. Dont be afraid to hoard resources. Chests are cheap to make so make one or two and stash your extra wood and stones. You may find yourself needing those resources later on. You can only move storage chests once you have taken everything out of it. You cannot accidentally throw items on the ground. In order to drop something you have to manually drag it out of your inventory. You can plant nonfruit trees in any season except winter. Fruit trees can grow any season. You do not need to till the soil to plant trees. You do not need to water trees. Trees do not need a scarecrow. Fruit trees will consume a x space when fully grown so do not occupy the  spaces around it while it is growing. Tilled soil counts as a used space so use the pickaxe to return the soil to normal. Nonfruit trees only need the  adjacent spaces around it cleared not the diagonal spots. When fully grown these trees may drop seeds onto the ground up to  tiles away. When any tree is fully grown you can start using the immediate space around it such as ground walkways or grass. I suggest grass around fruit trees since the sickle does nothing to trees. I suggest paths around nonfruit trees to prevent seeds from falling and starting new trees.,StardewValley,d1yyuyx,36,t5_2wb7y

7302604,0,t1_d287u4p,Ill have to do a little math on the rabbits to get good figures but my gut intuition is that they will be pretty poor.  wool and cloth is woefully undervalued compared to other produceartisanal goods.  especially when combined with the  day lay rate for rabbits and the fact that you cant get nearly free rabbits with the incubator.  Animal Pregnancy is another one of my major pet peeves.  First you have to win a  random number gen on a day with no other farm events bundle completions witches fairies meteors and a couple marriage events but then you have to win a . X number of coopdweller while having an open slot.  You can expect MAYBE one pregnancy per year if you have at least  animals that can get pregnant and keep an open slot for the baby.  You can get a duckchicken in  days every  days.  IMHO  Rabbits are for farming their feet not making money.  ,StardewValley,d28995v,3,t5_2wb7y

7362212,0,t3_4g5g5r,I am only on my second year so Im not a total expert but I used to suck and die often altf ftw and now I am pretty decent at combat so here is some tips.  For one I keep my pointer away from enemies and WASD to move and turn it makes it easier to aim and time attacks. Also try and kite enemies one at a time if possible they are a lot easier to deal with. Slimes gave me quite a bit of trouble early game but the tip that helped me is when they crouch down right click to counter the attack as they charge when they crouch.  Another thing when you get swarmed by bats ect I do one of two things one when you see a bat try and run towards it to kill as fast as possible before more show up two is to run to the ladder asap and get out.  Try to only use swords as the speed of daggers isnt worth the tiny range and no swingyou attack the tile in front of you only with daggers  Lastly try and get as low as you can as fast as you can. There are elevators every  floors and a reward every some of which are good weapons.  Hope this helps!,StardewValley,d2f17ch,1,t5_2wb7y

I go straight to the pastures every morning and the animals are generally just milling around near the entrances to their coops so I run about petting wildly.

Then I go milk my cows and goats counting as I go  theyre easier to keep track of than the coop animals in the grass so its not hard and collect up items out of the coops. Sheep are easy too because theres a visible difference when they need attention and the pigs usually leave truffles right by the barns.Ive tried petting them later in the day when theyre all back in the coopsbarns but you get a X is trying to sleep message too often.Im usually done with the animals by about  on a sunny day faster if its raining since the animals are all standing around in the coops.It makes me really happy that the most difficult part of my day revolves around petting animals.,StardewValley,d3mivys,7,t5_2wb7y

It could be ONLY that amount of grass separated out specifically into specific squares not next to one another thats enough.  grass   grass   grass.Take  grass and put it all in a bunch and most of it is not contributing to growth because its already surrounded by grass and your animals will eat it all and starve.Take the same  grass and force it to remain separated apart from itself and it will grow plenty and your animals will be fat and happy. The positioning matters and animals in an open field will always end up with the positioning of grass in few and large clumps. In the case of  grass spread out will grow over x faster than in a x clump.,StardewValley,d3po3j6,2,t5_2wb7y

7778742,0,t1_d0iqdde,I tried to figure out how much you could make if you reinvested. I may have counted wrong but thus far its interesting.I started with g as the max amount invested rounded to an even number of seeds purchased then the amount reinvested is whatever the harvest sells for. At first I forgot about blueberry regrowth but it looks like a net profit of g after five harvests.Corns looking like a net profit of g after four harvests I might have done something wrong. Tortillas sell for the same amount as corng but oil sells for twice as much g. As far as I know oil just takes one ear of corn right? So if thats true and if you turned each ear of corn into oil youd make g for a net profit of g. Hops are insane with a day regrowth rate supposedly. So it looks like a g net profit after a whopping  harvests. Im trying to figure out what the best mixture of selling and turning into ale is to maximize the number of cropsharvests. I thiiink I have it so youd end up with  ale for a net profit of g. Hot peppers look like a hell of a lot of work. ,StardewValley,d3qdn9o,1,t5_2wb7y

8139771,0,t3_4qq3p3,I always try to clear the mines in the first month just to get it out of the way so I can start working on sprinklers.  I dont even bother with secondary attacks like the blocking with swords and just spam click on mobs and usually do good.  For slimes you want to get them against a rock or wall and just spam.  Bats or moths you should chase if you have room so that every time you hit them and they get knocked back go in for another hit.  Keep going like that until they die.  If you knocked them into the wall where you cant reach just spam until they fly back in and reenter your range. I think once you get used to dodging more youll find its a lot easier.  I try to avoid enemies if I can help it and use the default sword for as long as possible. . . until I get the Obsidian Edge at floor spoiler so I can help from spending money at the adventuring guild.As for panning its a feature you can unlock.  If you dont mind spoilers take a look at the wiki pageIf you do mind spoilers just know that youll get it if you continue to progress the main story.Unless they changed anything since the last time I played its mostly useless sadly.Good luck in your mining efforts.,StardewValley,d4v0miq,7,t5_2wb7y

I have a setup with one pen for all random slimes and I sort them into color shade pens from there so its very clear when theyre in the wrong pen.I feel like the code works to only allow X number of slimes in one area not zone area of a zone and when you get over that number it moves them one area away.

9126038,0,t1_d88snjp,gtFirst off xjdgydrfg is not a good identifier.yeah its called an examplegthe first thing they teach you when coding is to give your variables classes etc. clear understandable names. Clint Pam Penny are all good examples of that point.Um. Theyre clear and understandable but they are not acceptable things to do. Wellbuilt games do not use the NPCs name and nothing else as an identifier. Because. It confuses. The game. If. You. Use. That. Name. Elsewhere.gtIf I look up these unique identifiers I can name my horse to xjdgydrfg and still screw with the NPCs.Well no shit dude but who is going to do that? Right now you can accidentally destroy your save file by naming something with a common name if it already exists in the game. Yeah you could still damage the game if you knew the unique ID and if you stupidly chose to use it as a name but what the hell does that have to do with the problem? The problem is taht this can happen by mistake. the problem ist hat NPCs are called with such generic identifiers that a player can mistakenly damage their game by using a real world name for any of the many many things they can name. By accident. Saying I could still intentionally damage the game if this was done properly! doesnt mean this isnt a problem.gtAnd third heres some advice backup you save files.Heres some criticism A game made competently doesnt require you to back up your save files.,StardewValley,d88sueu,0,t5_2wb7y

9554115,0,t3_5bpkjd,My personal rundown Seb I think Ive said this on a few posts now but Ill say it again Antisocial techie POS. And its that description that leads me to eventually marry him in every freaking save file I have. Like Hmm maybe Ill marry someone else this time? NOPE. Freaking this loser. Post marriage hes still pretty reclusive but known for classic lines like Hey look at me. Never forget that I love you youre everything to me. . . Now go make us some money. Shane Depressed Alcoholic Chicken man with low self esteem that really likes pizza apparently. Almost married him in my current save file... but guess who I ended up marrying. A lot of mixed reactions to his postmarriage behavior. As someone with depression and all that I think its pretty normal.  Emily Super friendly hippie chick that reminds me of the lady that lives down the street from me. Shes been a fan favorite since before she was a romancable optionand she still is. Personally shes not my type but to each their own. Shes still one of my favorite characters friendwise in the town. Abby Shes like the girl that most guysgals want right? Like Hey dude come play these video games with me! Lets order some chill food and go on a cool adventure! So like Leah if she were real shed also be bae. I dont know I just dig her character in general. I dont hear much about her post marriage though funny enough. I assume shes kind of middle of the road. Leah amp Elliott  starving artist babes. I put it that way because theyre both artists. And theyre both kinda gorgeous. From what Ive caught Leahs a fan favorite as a wife and Id believe itshed be bae if she were real. Ive heard mixed reactions to Elliott. Alex amp Haley Made out to seem really shallow and conceited early in the game. Haley still kinda is. Alex is cool when you get to know him though. I dont know much about Haley post marriage but I hear Alex is a total sweetheartone of the best guys to marry. Only downside to marrying him is that his room is dorky. Sam Bruh how old are you? I getdude I get that you live with your mom so you need to be respectful or follow her rules to a certain extent. But if youre a legal adult shes not your keeper. Jesus he acts like a child. Thats probably why him and Penny get along so well. As far as postmarriage goes he still doesnt mature much because his outdoor area is a halfpipe compared to the reading areas and or other still more age appropriate hobbies. Seriously is he significantly younger than everyone else? Did I miss that?? Penny Shes nice okay? Some people theorize that she only becomes interested in the player because its a way out of her home situation  youre probably successful at that point. I try to give her the benefit of the doubtif youre going to just donate your time to tutor local kids out of a pure desire to see them go somewhere in life you cant be too horrible of a person. Post marriage I assume shes very motherly. Harvey Doctor Who? Amirite? Joking joking! Ill show myself out.   Harveys probably the oldest so youd think hed be the most mature. And in most ways he is. He definitely has his shit together. But in other ways hes kind of a manchild but in a somewhat cute way so its alright. From what Ive heard hes a good hubby. Maru Okay now as a nerdy person who comes from a nerdy family and as someone who has always had nerdy friends right youd think that Id like Maru. But I just dont. Shes like my least favorite person in the game for whatever reason. I think Demetrius is awesome but I dont like Maru. I can get behind Clints sour sarcasm but I dont like Maru. I dont know man. Anyway super smart cool chick with a bright future that the player kind of ruins by marrying her I guess. Post marriage shes middle of the road. My best friend married her pre. and shed sometimes end up giving her bombs in the morning. Like Hey good morning dear have a freaking bomb!  So anyway yeah.   Excuse the wall of text. Its AM here so why not.,StardewValley,d9qqprl,12,t5_2wb7y

The trick here is to not only plant those free seeds but also go spend all the remaining money and get more seeds to plant on day . You can sell forage items to the shopkeep for more immediate pay too.Theres no reason to be saving up before you reach the part of the season where its too late to grow anything more in time and just harvest bar fitting in a backpack upgrade or a coop  silo if you have money to spare over what your energy usage can reasonably deal with.,StardewValley,dbc5eh0,2,t5_2wb7y

10061702,0,t1_dbj07s2,I had quite a bit more iridum ore but have turned them into bars.  Ended up making  crystalariums in the last few in game weeks with them. If you load up on stone to make stairs you can get to level  in the skull caves quite easily.  If you bring a few food items that give you a luck boost enough bombs and a generic food item for health doesnt have a bonus associated with it you can get to  levels pretty easily.Once you get to  levels iridium nodes become much more common.  One cave dive can result in  iridum if not more.  This was from my one and only cave dive on this save.  Note I didnt get many diamonds but I ended up with  Prismatic shards.  The key is to dive the mine with Lucky Lunch... which I planned ahead for blue jazz in summer corn for tortillas in summerfall and Sea Cucumber in fallwinter.  I collected these items in the first year and made as many lucky lunches as I could the second year I also bought them if I came across them as the Saloon or Krobus.  I used one lucky lunch while diving and using stairs keeps away the snakes and used a second one when my stone was gone I kept  stone for emergency stairs in case of infested levels.  Once I got to that point I used coffee to keep my speed up ate pizza for health used a ton of bombs I left with  and ended up with  and ate Lucky lunch as soon as the  luck wore off.

10103725,0,t3_5kji8w,A lot of people here are giving you goals to complete. However if you want to know what to do in general here are some descriptions of different activitiesFarming This one is pretty straightforward. Plant seeds. You start with some parsnip seeds but you can buy more at Pierres shop be warned hes closed on Wednesdays. Make sure to water your crops every day unless its raining. After you harvest your crops you can sell them however you may not want to sell everything you grow or get more on that later. All seasonal crops die out at the end of the season.Foraging Every season there are a few items that can be found around town. If youre walking and see something sticking out of the grass see if you can pick it up. If you can thats a forageable. Of course that only covers normal forageables. In spring and autumn many bushes will contain something and you can right click the bush to take it. There are also shells and other things to forage on the beach.Fishing On your second day youll get a letter from the town fisherman telling you to meet him at the beach. Once you do hell give you a fishing rod. To use it face the water and hold the mouse button down. Try to fill the bar and let go. Eventually youll see a ! and hear a sound. Click right after you hear that. Youll might catch some trash like seaweed or driftwood but youll more likely see the word Hit! and the fishing minigame will begin. This is the hard part. A fish icon will move around on a vertical bar and you have to left click to move a smaller bar behind it upwards. Keep your bar behind the fish for as long as possible. As soon as you try this this is going to seem extremely difficult but as your fishing level goes up it is going to get much MUCH easier and youll be able to get  in a day from fishing easily. Keep in mind that different fish are found in different locations so while you might find sardines and anchovies in the ocean youll find sunfish and shad in the river and bullhead in the lake.Mining After your th day the mines will open in the northeast next to the big lake. This is one of the few places in the game where monsters will appear and so youll get a sword as soon as you enter. To start mining just take the ladder nearby and youll find yourself on the first floor filled with rocks and monsters. You may have the urge to mine every single rock but that is really a waste of time as you usually wont find much and it takes up energy. You should only mine rocks if theyre in your way you really need stone or if its ore which looks like a rock with colored bits coming out of it. Soon enough one of the rocks you break or monsters you kill will reveal a hole and ladder in the ground which you should take to get to the next level. Every day you mine you should go down  levels. The reason for this will be clear as soon as you get to level  where you discover that theres a working mine elevator to use and it appears every  levels. Dont make the mistake I did in my first game and assume that it visits every level because I ended up taking the elevator to level  mining  levels and going back meaning when I came back I just went back to level  and repeated the process.Tips Check that TV in your house every day. There are  channels on it  of which appear every day the weather channel and the fortune teller channel. The weather channel simply tells you what the weather will be like tomorrow. The fortune teller tells you how good your luck is for the day which affects various aspects of your life particularly your chance of getting good things when mining. Livin Off the Land which appears twice a week gives you tips mostly on foraging. The Queen of Sauce appears once a week and gives you cooking recipes to make once you upgrade your house youll have a kitchen to make them in. You might notice that your farm is filled with grass not the bushes that you cant walk through the patches of grass that you can walk through. No matter how much you want to DONT CUT IT. Once you get a silo grass you cut has a high chance of automatically turning into hay you can use to feed your animals and cutting it before you can turn it into something useful is a waste. Speaking of which... Get a silo before you get a coop or barn. If you dont have a silo youll have to buy animal food. If you do have a silo you can make it yourself. Become friends with people. If you open the menu theres a friendship tab that shows how many hearts you have with each villager. This shows how friendly you are with the villagers. Each heart counts as  friendship points. The easiest way to be more friendly with a villager is just talking to them which increases your friendship points by  the best way however is giving them gifts. Not all villagers have the same taste. One mans hated item may be another ones loved. If they love the gift thats  points. If they like it thats . If theyre neutral towards it thats . If you give a gift to someone on their birthday you gain or lose  times as many points with them. You can check birthdays by looking at the calendar in front of Pierres. You may be wondering how to find which gifts are hated and which are loved by villagers which brings me to my next point The wiki is your friend. Seriously. When I get an interesting item or grow a crop I look up the item on the wiki to see if anyone loves it. Remember when I mentioned in the Farming section that you might not want to sell all your crops? This is one of the reasons why. Ill get to the other reason shortly. A few days into your game there will be a cutscene about the abandoned community center. Theres a minor storyline that takes a small amount of time to complete but Ill skip that and assume you can now enter the community center and use it. Youll start with one placard in the bottom left corner that you can right click to open. These are all foraging bundles. Essentially there are a few bundles which you need to deposit the specified items in. For example the first bundle youll complete is almost certainly the Spring Foraging Bundle. Just add the  items which can be easily foraged for and youll then get a reward and another placard will be revealed filled with farming bundles. The second bundle you complete will probably be Spring Crops which you have to fill with a parsnip a potato a cauliflower and a green bean. Make sure you grow all of these or youll have to wait another year to complete the bundle! Once you complete all the bundles in a specific placard a part of the town will be fixed such as the bus to the desert or the bridge to the quarry. You can also take the Jojamart path where you just buy all the town fixes. You activate this path by buying a jojamart membership there but I would not recommend it. Not only is it a lot more fun to find all the items for the community center but taking the jojamart path is basically selling your soul to the devil and you feel dirty inside. On the subject of Jojamart Buy seeds from Pierres not Jojamart. Jojamart seeds are more expensive. Simple as that.I hope this was helpful!

And not even just a relationship with the player as she is to me clearly cheating on the player by attempting to romance Sam at the same time.Cough  You cant accuse her of attempting to manipulate you through artificial romantic interest and then claim you implied no romantic connection.  Add to that the fact that the colloquialism dating refers to an attempt to build a sexual andor romantic relationship.gtThe Penny relationship does however takes romantic overtones at the Six Heart event because she names the meal that she put real effort and was banking confidence on after you.Because as she makes a point of saying by showing up when you did youve bungled your way into being the first person to try it.  Youre a friend and you give her validation on an interest shes insecure about.And as for the flirty dialogue Abbys constantly dropping hints that shed like to marry me.

10190670,0,t3_5lwxe7,The white bees are tough at first but you can maneuver your character so if you have multiple bees they come at you from the same ish direction. Swing your sword and it will bounce back all of them. Time your attacks so that you keep repelling them away from you. Other than that bring lots of food with you. If you have the blueprint unlocked make the field snack one type of seed from every tree since they dont cost you anything to make and the materials are abundant.  If all that fails run. Get to the lower levels as quick as you can and you will find better swords or unlock better ones to buy. Honestly I think its a waste of money to buy the swords since you can just find them.  I seen a comment that said you can find swords by fishing but Ive had  different files with maxed out fishing skill and Ive never found a sword so I wouldnt bet too heavily on that.Also if you kill  bugs mosquito grubs or white bees Gil rewards you with a decent lowerlevel weapon.

10497122,0,t3_5qadsj,The shortest possible tldr of this problem is  Aside from   very specific circumstances listed in the final bullet point points a player EDIT preendgame player using Preserves Jars will always have more money than a player using Kegs.  For more info read on.Well this sort of question is actually a bit more complicated than it first seems so if you dont care about the theory behind it just skip around to the bulletpoints for the rules.  Anyways lets start with some basicsgtIs there an easy way to tell which goes where?  ...  should I process everything including starred crops?! Fruits with a base value of g or less and Veggies with a base value of g or less should always go in the Preserves Jar no matter what.  The JellyPickles will be worth moreequal to the WineJuice and as a bonus it will come out in  days vs.  days. Wheat amp Hops should always go into Kegs because Beer amp Pale Ale are especially valuable and brewed quickly. If you are producing more crops than you can handle with your KegsJars or need to sell some of them right now for extra cash put all the normal quality ones in the KegsJars first.  Then sell all the gold and silver quality crops once your Jars are full since crop quality does not affect KegsJars.  Similarly if you have a variety of crops put the types of crops with the highest base value into your jarsKegs first Pumpkins Rhubarbs etc. and sell off the cheaper ones Blueberries Parsnips etc..  Of course its always handy to keep a backlog of crops for Winter to keep the Jars going even without your fields producing.These  points should be followed no matter what.  Beyond this what you do kinda depends on what your goal is to maximize Profit per Crop or maximize Gold per Day.  Many of the responses here are good tips for maximizing Profit per Crop however I find Profit per Crop to be a bit of a silly goal in a game like Stardew Valley.  You just want to get as rich as possible as quickly as possible you dont care about how much profit each individual crop makes right?gtWould you mind ELI the difference between profit margin and GDP?So profit margin or Profit per Crop is basically trying to squeeze the most money possible out of every crop even if it ends up taking longer.  If this is your goal its pretty simple To maximize Profit per Crop put all Fruit with a base value more than g and all Veggies with a base value more than g into the Keg.  Eventually put your most valuable Wines into Casks in the Cellar to increase value even more.The alternative is maximizing your Gold per Day or essentially how much money you are making every day or how quickly you get rich.  In my mind this is the actual important concept because in Stardew Valley all your resources are basically infinitely renewable so it doesnt make sense to try to stretch them further at the cost of making money slower.  For instance would you rather get to  total earned in Year  but know that you squeezed the most money out of all those cranberries by turning them into Wine or get to  total earned in Year  even if you turned all those Cranberries into Jelly which sold for less?Now if you are trying to maximize your Gold per Day which is the only one which makes sense to me the very short answer is that Preserves Jars will always get you more Gold per Day than a Keg with the exceptions of Wheat and Hops.  You can see the basic math behind it in this spreadsheet where JellyPickles always have higher Gold per Day than Wine  Juice.  However do note that the sheet is out of date in that it lists JellyPickles as taking  days to produce instead of the current  days.  Even with a  day wait Jars still give more Gold per Day.In practice however it can get a little complicated.  Preserves Jars get you more Gold per Day but obviously they can only do that while they are actually running.  If you are in a situation where you are growing so few crops or have so many extra Preserves Jars that your Jars are sitting empty half the time you may actually do better putting those crops into Kegs.  The deciding factor is how many crops you will be producing vs. how many JarsKegs you will be able to build.For example say you have an overabundance of Cranberries and are choosing between building  Kegs or  Jars.  If you build  Kegs each bottle will be worth  x   g so you will make g x  every  days. At the end of a full month you will have made  x  x   g per month.  If instead you build  Jars each jar of jelly will be worth  x     g so you will make g x  every  days. At the end of a full month you will have made g x  x   g per month.On the other hand say you only have  Ancient Fruit plants so you are only harvesting  Ancient Fruit per week. In that case it would be  x  x   g per month for the Kegs or  x  x   g per month for the Jars because in this situation you can only run the Jars once per week when you have Ancient Fruit available to process.  So to sum up To maximize Gold per Day if you will be making enough crops quickly enough to keep all the Jars full and working all the time build Jars to put all your crops into except Wheat amp Hops.  If you already have some Kegs lying around and still will have crops left over put your most valuable base price crops into the Kegs.   If however you are only making a few crops or are planning to build a huge number of KegsJars so that many of the Jars would sit unused a large portion of the time are growing fruit with slow enough production cycles and have progressed enough to be able to build enough KegsJars that you wont have enough crops to keep all your Jars full all the time or are growing Wheat amp Hops build Kegs to put the g Fruits and g Veggies into and Wheat amp Hops.   EDIT There is an edge case if you are using Quality Fertilizer on all crops in a situation where you are constantly selling off all excess crops instead of saving any for some reason only for Ancient Fruit amp Starfruit if your ratio of plantstoKegsJars is within a very specific range where Kegs remain more profitable for a bit even after you have enough crops to keep your Jars full all the time.  More details here.One final point is that Kegs have a hidden benefit in that because they take longer to produce things you end up doing less work for them.  E.G. running to collect amp refill Kegs once a week vs. doing it twice a week for Preserves Jars.  Of course this usually isnt really a concern until you have hundreds of them.gtI love this fucking game!

If you translate to GPD gold per day which is a formula that takes the yield of the crop cost to purchase and amount of days to grow the best bang for your buck is the Sweet Gem Berry. Its hard to do that in massive amounts as seeds can only be bought from the cart and only be planted in fall.Most popular but what takes grinding is the ancient fruit specifically in the greenhouse. Because it yields every  days after growing you dont have to keep replanting.Most popular seasonal items are the strawberry spring blueberry summer and cranberry fall. All have multiple yields in the season usually  or .Bank for buck what can be bought for a SINGLE HARVEST is Starfruit summer but its much easier to access once you make it to the desert. Single harvest seasonal are cauliflower melons and pumpkins.Done correctly summer hops can be very profitable as well.Hope that helps!,StardewValley,dd2tafb,10,t5_2wb7y

10691967,0,t3_5stux5,This is a hard question to answer. I will say I originally wanted to marry Elliot because Im also a writer and frankly his hair is marvelous. But now Im not sure. Haley goes through such a wonderful character arc that I adore her. She was the first character I gave a bouquet to as well. So far Ive given them to Haley Abigail Elliot and Shane.Abigails heart scene by the mountain is charming and shes just an interesting character all around. Sebastian seems so sad and alone in his house that I want to bring him to my home. Although he also says he wants to live in the city so I kind of dont want to have him feel stuck on the farm with me. Sam is a sweetheart and Ive always had a thing for musicians especially blonde ones. Harvey I just want to learn more about since hes easy to miss when I wander through town.I guess what Im trying to say is its very very hard to choose. Im actually getting everyone to eight hearts and giving them all bouquets before I decide. Except maybe Maru. She just doesnt interest me at all. Im basically only courting her because Im curious and determined to date everyone.So my best advice? Just keep dating everyone until you know for sure who you want. You can always change your mind later anyway.,StardewValley,ddispzf,1,t5_2wb7y

10805947,0,t1_ddu4cyq,This is an AmericanWestern thing although I do think its probably similar in repressive Eastern culture although in a different way.In general in America male sexuality especially for young men is belittled mocked and ridiculed. Calling a young man a virgin nerd that masturbates is the height of insults to a young man. So to do the same to a woman is really taboo. Americans insist women dont masturbate and there is a general consensus that women dont even like sex and its nasty men forcing women to have sex most of the time against their will. Youll get denial about it but anyone thats actually traveled around the world and especially to most of Europe will readily notice it and absolutely laugh at it. Although if Im being fair its worst in the big liberal American cities and not really as bad in other areas. But nowhere near what Europe would consider normal. Americans are afraid of nudity and sex because of puritanical repressive origins. The irony though is the marketing is all about sex but Im told that is normal for repressive cultures that have to then express things in that way.I know Im about to get downvoted to hell and back by prudish Americans but its true. ,StardewValley,dduk2rk,9,t5_2wb7y

11095543,0,t1_deoxfbo,Theres a saying in the therapy world world that works for relationships like this too...Dont work any harder than the client. My husband stopped taking his medicine stopped going to meetings changed jobs to one thats worse isolated himself and thats when things became hell. He stopped doing the work. Ive tried to do the work for him in the past and have learned that its not for me. That being said there are things that could make it easier or much harder for him and I am working to try to make it easier. Like not being so critical. Ive been there for him at cliffs edge. I took the loaded gun out of his hand and would do it again if I needed to. Im not going to push him over.  I noticed that Shane still went to the bar and drank alcohol after going to the therapist I read that if you married him his room was messy and had beer cans in it...thats the real reason I didnt choose Shane. Hes not doing the work. The reason I hold on and stay IRL is because he now is working on it and really trying. His friend group has expanded and it really takes some of the weight off me. Ive seen him do really well when he puts in the work.  I understand that hes not perfect. But I cant love his addiction or depression away. Some brains dont produce enough serotonin or have an over abundance of cortisol. Unfortunately isolating from other people actually makes this worse. I understand when you are close to the cliffs edge you dont want to risk the thought of someone pushing you even closer or even over the edge. Its easier to not have friends so you dont have to worry about hurting them or feeling like they are just dealing with your shit. I promise you that this wont do you any good. Everyone has shit in their life and that is something we can connect to others about. Not comparing shit Look mines bigger than yours but more like heres my shit lets see yours!

I suspect they wont be able to help though.If the save is really important to you it may be possible to reconstruct it.

11392119,0,t1_dfn9igc,Havent played it so I cant say if it is or it isnt. But if kegging is the natural fermentation process then making spirits in kegs doesnt make sense. Youd need to ferment before you can distill. Thats how spirits are made.Alternatively if you wanted it to still be a two step process like it is now you can skip the fermentation and go straight to the copper still. The still wouldnt be representing natural fermentation and thus make more sense. The only problem with this methodology is price control. Kegs make wine which is the most profitable way to refine a crop so if there is no transitional point its hard to determine what value to give to the still. It would obviously need to take longer if you wanted to simulate the fermentation process.Course from a balance perspective distilling wine into brandy also has another potential balance problem and that would be the use of casks. But maybe you could address that by just saying you could cask distilled alcohol as well shrugs.,StardewValley,dfna380,3,t5_2wb7y

11410941,0,t1_dfp672t,Well your wine WAS worth a handful of diamonds until the market corrected from the influx of thousands of bottles of starfruit wine.  Additionally Joja has successfully lobbied that your starfruits are genetically modified as starfruits actually grow multiple on trees and not as single fruit plants. When your wine production outgrew what would be considered a hobby and entered the realm of commercial production you ran afoul of many laws regarding the production of alcoholic beverages. The county has filed an injunction against your business operations. Furthermore it has come to light that you have paid nothing in taxes It brought down Al Capone and itll bring down your farm. Perhaps you dont know how a corporate buyout really works ,StardewValley,dfpf215,2,t5_2wb7y

11495804,0,t1_dfxv5vf,Eh skip ancient fruit outside. You wanna talk about too much work? Tilling every last scrap of tillable land then making all the sprinklers to keep them watered? Thats too much work. Hops does require harvesting on a daily basis yes. However they produce far more profit than ancient fruit and with only  ancient fruit per week harvested comes up to  wine per season made which means you can actually age a good portion of it instead of only a tiny fraction. Its a matter of personal preference. If you just want to do  trees and  ancient fruit you can. But most of the kegs are for the pomegranate. Each tree requires  kegs to support since they produce daily and it takes a week to brew. That means you need  kegs just for the pomegranate. Then another  for the ancient fruit for a total of  kegs you will need. My way needs another  kegs because it takes twice as many kegs to keep up with an equal number of hops because hops produces daily but takes roughly two days to process into ale.As always YMMV,StardewValley,dfz1re9,1,t5_2wb7y

Of course I do all this because I have enough money if youre not financially stable yet I suggest putting down some grass starter and then putting a lighting rod or a fence on the patch so the animals cant eat it and it can grow. ,StardewValley,dg6wdwb,2,t5_2wb7y
