We have an all star lineup of regional bands in the area who are ready to play the only thing missing is you!  of the proceeds from this show will go to clean water organizations listed below the lineup who are fighting to get water and supplies to those most in need. gtWe will be adding bands to the lineup in the coming days so please stay tuned and please share with all of your friends and family and come support this very worthwhile cause. gtMusical LineupgtUnfinished BusinessThe Woo YeahsAarodynamicsNoetic PullThe BraesMany More TBAgtSuggested donation is  at the door although no one will be turned away until we reach capacity. So if you cannot afford  we just ask that you donate what you can. We may also accept water and supply donations in place of cash if we can find a truck driver to deliver the goods the next day. gtNo doubt youve heard that in Central West Virginia on Thursday January   gallons of a chemical used by coal prep plants leaked from a storage tank into the Elk River about . miles upstream of a municipal water supply intake. The leak was discovered that morning but it wasnt until that afternoon about ten hours later that West Virginia American Water Company issued a do not use order to  people in nine counties.gtA chemical smell pervaded the area and lingers still in both the air and the water. Schools businesses and some government agencies shut down. Hospitals cancelled scheduled procedures and scrambled to take care of admitted patients.gtToday schools in four counties are still shuttered and as of  water had been restored for only onethird of the water companys customers. So many folks still cant use their tap water to drink cook bathe or wash dishes or clothes.gtEven in areas where people have followed procedures to flush their water lines and tanks and authorities have given the go ahead to resume using water people are still worried about using their water. There are reports of odors bubbling strange colors and more illnesses.gtAlthough government aid workers are getting bottled water to some central distribution points such as local fire departments there are shutsins elderly and folks in rural areas who are still in dire need of it.gtThats why volunteers and organizers working with Aurora Lights Coal River Mountain Watch Keeper of the Mountains RAMPS and OVEC have been out every day since the leak delivering water in smaller communities.gtWe come together on Friday January  to raise money for these charities who are on the front lines fighting to get water and aid to those who desperately need it particularly in the most rural areas unreached by many of the previous deliveries. These organizations have fought before and will continue to fight for clean water in the State of West Virginia. gt of all proceeds will go towards the organizations aboveThis event will be taking place Friday January th at pm at Longshots Billiards.

If you really want to just take your time rest often bring plenty of snacks and water an inhaler if you have one and maybe some aspirin. But again Id get it cleared with his doc.

8000205,0,t1_d4f2xm3,gtIt has been tried before there were such protections and you even included in your quote the part of my comment where I noted my reference to it.Well it certainly isnt the case now or for anytime in the recent past.  We rank th out of  states for regulatory freedom.   gtMy second quoted text you just rephrased. personal morals are a bit harder to quantify  this is for individuals to decide Nowhere did I attempt to make any choice for anyone very sorry you misunderstood.Then you should be ok with limiting regulations and letting workers decide this for themselves. As for Rider insurance yes the problem is that people can file frivolous lawsuits without any consequence and the state requires Rider to front the bill.  This is unlike most states and creates an environment in which they cannot compete without raising premiums for the Cxs.Im not very impressed with the Mooney quote since the state is apt to defend their policies.  Moreover Rider addresses this by saying that the prohibitive costs make it so that only large and established companies can do business that appears to be who Mooney was referencing.  A specialized company like Rider cannot afford to compete not because it doesnt offer a good service but because of the cost of frivolous lawsuits.  I would also bet my bottom dollar that such large companies support the current legal structure since it limits competition.       gtE That company also had already had state laws changed to benefit them and still said it wasnt enough specifically shortening the time by half that an insurer can cancel a policyThe Legislature has also taken steps to make the insurance market more competitive with other states Bland said. SB  passed during the last session reduces the period of time insurers must wait to cancel automobile insurance policies for nonpayment  from  days to  days.Its just another example of a company that has no problem competing in other states but finds WV too prohibative. ,WestVirginia,d4fas26,1,t5_2rfre
