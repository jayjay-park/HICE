2086631,0,t3_2irqjo,Hi BrilliantezzaThere are a few libraries in the US that have this pamphlet. Here is a link to the WorldCat record If you have access to a university or public library that offers interlibrary loan privileges you may be able to have a copy sent to you directly should you want to see it for yourself.Sincerelya librarian ,stanford,cl521x9,7,t5_2r7qd

7366466,0,t3_4g5q5f,By planning to transfer already youre not even giving the school youre going to a chance!  Freshman year is a crazy and transformative period where you can meet lifelong friends.  But if you plan to leave them going in youll build barriers in your mind and miss out.My advice is to embrace school next year.  I loved my undergrad wasnt at Stanford and wouldnt trade it for anywhere else.  Plan to apply here for your higher ed  Stanford is primarily a graduate school anyway.,stanford,d2filjz,3,t5_2r7qd

My first summer I applied to a few REUs but didnt get into any I didnt apply to companies or oncampus research opportunities so I ended up as a counselor at a math camp.,stanford,d70ar02,1,t5_2r7qd
9471152,0,t1_d9edsaa,Adding anecdotal evidence  as a BioE undergrad now coterming in CS  last year I only knew of one BioE coterm and this year I only know of one BioE coterm. My impression is that the BioE department prefers to take Masters applicants from other schools rather than coterms and that BioE undergrads who want to coterm tend towards other engineering departments or BIOMEDIN which was relatively popular among seniors last year.,stanford,d9giwcj,1,t5_2r7qd

I visit Stanford a lot during the school year for work and the amount of times Ive actually felt afraid that I was going to get hit has been way too many. Some of the students are absolutely crazy with how fast and intense they ride. ,stanford,ddsjcre,2,t5_2r7qd
10910484,0,t1_de56way, reviews vary. personally i agree that it has one of the best dining halls in the country but youll find that dining hall food cant get that good just by virtue of the fact that its served buffet style and has to be ready for thousands of people within hours. Still you can tell they put a lot of effort and money into the food. Theres special dining events all the time Lunar New Year cuisine Diwali etc. Sometimes chefs host private dinners where students can eat gourmet food prepared personally by the chefs. But on a daytoday basis you will be eating food that is . Honestly I think its still better than cafeteria food Ive had at any other institution though. You can come try out what the food tastes like if you come to Admit Weekend! ,stanford,de5c7vd,10,t5_2r7qd
