9476029,0,t1_d9guf9y,Yeah.  I have an inherited disease that only affects women though men can be carriers.  I got it from my dad who obviously being male didnt show that he carried it and could pass it on to any female children.  I didnt even know it existed until last year much less that I had it.  Untreated it causes all kinds of other problems and because I didnt know I had it for thirty years it was completely untreated.  The only thing it causes that I seem to have dodged so far is cancer.I was shamed by my doctor and other other medical professionals for years for having diabetes.  Obviously it was my fault.  I must have a terrible diet or just need to exorcise.  Clearly when I say I actually only eat one small meal a day because of a hectic schedule I must be lying and gorging myself on junk food.  Yeah not so much.  Turns out thats one of the first major things it can cause.  And no diet and exorcise is never going to get rid of it.The anxiety mostly comes from being a naturally introverted person in a family of extreme extroverts and being treated as a bother and a nonperson during my formative years.

Not to pick on you or anything but its precisely this sort of cognitive dissonance that makes Stranger Danger so destructive because we allow ourselves a false sense of security with it while depriving ourselves of the benefits of larger community.The problem will not change until we stop following propaganda mindlessly and start thinking.

11392786,0,t1_dfn6ynw,We did something similar. I used to work for a call center that took recruitment calls for a major US airline. We would answer the call with Thank you for calling Name of Airlines job line. In what state would you like to work? Nine times out of ten the caller would say the name of a city instead. That basically eliminated them from any further consideration. And most times the city that they named was not even serviced by that airline.One time I asked a caller what state hed like to work in and his response was LA. So I read him the list of cities in Louisiana that said airline served. He said I wanna work in Los Angeles. I told him Sir I asked you what STATE you want to work in. LA is the twoletter abbreviation for Louisiana. He then proceeded to curse me out. I calmly told him that a key element when applying for a job is listening skills and to try using them next time.,IDontWorkHereLady,dfnctn6,67,t5_341k1
