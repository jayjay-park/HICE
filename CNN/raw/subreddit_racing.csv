1206862,0,t1_ci5dadf,Sound deadening is the black tar like patches covering parts of the interior after the carpet is removed. Center of gravity....  Lower yourself  lower the fuel  lower parts like the battery lower the suspension  lower the engine  cut some of the support material from the roof etc.Remember a wiring harness has leads for power windows  lights radio defrost and many other useless creature comforts.   Find those leads and pull the wires from the harness.   Youll save  pounds depending on the car.,racing,ci5e2c7,1,t5_2qknn

7570659,0,t3_4izv4k,rFactor is what I would use or rFactor . Could also use GSCE which is just rFactor  made a little better by brazilians. Very easy to make mods especially given that you know the exact dimensions of all your suspension components. Kidnap some D graphics student to make you a model. AC is an alternative but it is missing some features of rFactor and they are known to often update the game in ways that break all mods so youd have to keep on top of that. If you just want a FSAE car to drive around in LFS is a great sim that includes one in the stock content and has many tweakable values. You cannot mod LFS though so you wont be able to do your car in particular.,racing,d32qwjk,4,t5_2qknn

The author has put together a lot of successful sponsorship deals in Formula  but his ideas and examples scale down well to local programs.

11461728,0,t3_63gzrm,This is honestly a very complicated question. It depends on far too many factors. what class you will be racing in as that plays a big part in cost for preping the car and getting it competitive how much attending the race costs the quality of tire used and the rate you burn through themalso what car you use. Some cars are much cheaper for parts and maintenance then others. I could point at examples of cheap and expensive racing for both track and rally.,racing,dfv6h64,1,t5_2qknn
