10964715,0,t3_5vpgin,A tank is quite needed in PVE once you get to higher chapters some bosses nuke or target a specific hero.  Taunts also generally carry arena pvp until you hit about rank  where damage is everything and RNGesus kicks in. Id recommend running grove guard  rooster rover earl pale brokenbladelady ray depending on dungeonsituation Honorable mentions Deer Cutie is strong late gameTerribull falls off at lvl  so dont waste too much matsPyro monk once relics are awakened and leveled up he gets BROKEN in arena.  Dont spend anything on PaladinFlame Dame just not worth it,hyperheroes,deaxlov,1,t5_3hrow
