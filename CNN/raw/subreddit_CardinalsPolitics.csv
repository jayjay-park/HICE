The German right wing parties the CDU and the SPD will likely still control the government it is just a question of who will control the coalition. This will decide their Prime Minister and whether it is Merkel or not. ,CardinalsPolitics,deagh9a,1,t5_3hfre
11152712,0,t1_dew2vp1,So I spend too much of my work day sourcing and analyzing data for these topics so instead of being tedious now Im just going to be opinionated bare with me. For A I dont see it as an issue whatsoever. The  general problem I see in the US is how we fetishize the constitution. It shouldnt matter if its constitutional if its a really good idea. If it is we should change it so its not anymore.B C What about France? The UK? They have larger countries with quite successful national health care systems. Basically every developed country has a better system than we do IMO even the relatively crappy ones. E If the US is so fundamentally different with regards to wealth why would people leave to go to places that are so fundamentally similar with what we want to be? In terms of taxation theyve paid incredibly higher taxes in the past so I dont think thats really reasonable to say oh well and say its impossible.F People caring for the poor is not a goal anyone above a local level should care about. Its not a policy issue.All this to say I do believe there are relatively conservative ways to do healthcare Switzerlandish ways mostly  but try telling my Trumpian family in the country we should force companies to have a nonprofit option. There is absolutely no way have a good healthcare system with adequate access that is very far the right of the ACA Id consider the individual mandate relatively close to the nonprofit reg. I think these are solid compromises even though I would prefer a system with a negligible out of pocket cost.,CardinalsPolitics,dew5c9p,2,t5_3hfre
