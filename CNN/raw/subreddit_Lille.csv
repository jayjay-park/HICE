The staff are also more interested in stringing tennis rackets and watching television than actually seeing to customers but it offers the advantage of being dirt cheap and having some decent free weights that you dont always see in some of the more commercial gyms  it has  kg dumbbells and a proper squat rack for example. Its definitely more spitandsawdust than chromeandjuicebar.,Lille,cnq99ta,3,t5_2shvb
