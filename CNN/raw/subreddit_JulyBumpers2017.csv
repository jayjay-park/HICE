9943001,0,t3_5hx1hj,The blood test youre thinking of is called NonInvasive Prenatal Testing NIPT. Common brand names are Materniti Panorama Verifi amp Harmony. The primary reason people use them is to screen for trisomy   and  in the first trimesterbut because the tests use fetal DNA in the mothers blood to look for those trisomies they can also see whether the baby is a boy or girl. If youre in the U.S. I think the tests are pretty broadly available but it will be a bit of a crapshoot about whether your insurance will cover it if youre not over . My insurance Anthem BCBS PPO recently switched to covering it for all pregnancies but I think theyre one of the first to cover it for women under . If youre in Canada or somewhere with universal health care my understanding is that NIPT typically isnt covered unless you fail one of earlier screening tests for the trisomies.Hope thats helpful!,JulyBumpers2017,db3lier,4,t5_3h8w1

I feel like my mil will get offended and get upset then my fil will almost guaranteed say something nasty to my husband about how he needs to respect his mom but they still try to treat us as kids. Im  and husband is  weve been married for  years together  and bought our own house a year ago. I want to be treated and respected as a parent. Im hoping when we talk to her that she will truly listen and change her tune. What gets me is I dont understand why shes gathering all this crap as we live a distance away and Im going to be home with baby  with no intentions to need much babysitting and even when I do I would be bringing along my pack and play and car seat if I were going to let them drive my baby aroundwasnt planning on that as mil is a distracted driver. Like me bringing my stuff for him would be an inconvenience which it wont be at all rendering it unnecessary for anyone to have their own stuff for him. ,JulyBumpers2017,ddzh88n,1,t5_3h8w1

He tells me daily Mommy I love you so much. I always had this notion in my mind that boys were rough and tumble and obnoxious but my little guy is showing me that doesnt have to be the case. I am looking forward to my second little boy who will be joining us. Dont make yourself feel bad it is perfectly normal to feel that way. And give yourself a week or two.

A nurse checked me and found that I was a fingertip dilated which she later adjusted to be a dimple. I am earlier along than you and obviously my situation is very different than yours but the way I am getting through my worry is by trusting that since my doctor felt comfortable releasing me I should trust that is the best thing for me for now. Its super hard not to get hung up worrying about everything that could go wrong but I am doing my best to be optimistic. I trust my doctor and her medical staff but I know thats not the case for everyone here! I just got lucky with a good group! When is your next appointment?

11544917,0,t1_dg4kgun,I usually will wear the same tape strips for a few days. Its water resistant. Basically I wear it until it just FEELS like I need to change it. You can cut anything that stops adhering to the skin after a shower right off which helps it last more comfortably too. I shower everyday and the tape will last about  days. Its really not the most comfortable thing when its wet but I find that if i press a dry towel onto the area a few times to collect excess moisture it does the trick. It helps to have a partner for the taping. Im not sure I could access the spots on my back without DH! Its much cheaper than physical therapy if youre in the States. I continue to be amazed at how well it works. My SI joint pain went from excruciating in certain positions to nonexistent.

Theyve said theres not and its just a gift to help us out thats the type of people they are so Im not surprised but I AM shocked that due to the sheer amount theyre offering there wasnt a stipulation to move down closer to them.

11757038,0,t1_dgsna44,gt having a preference for a smooth uncomplicated delivery with a healthy baby at the end somehow is frivolous.But thats what perplexes me... who doesnt want that? Im not saying anyone is ambivalent to their or their babys health. I am saying that there is a difference between a birth plan light epidural if possible and birth fantasy birth on a cloud with no pain.  I think its a much more productive exercise if people want to talk about birth plans than these fantasy scenarios. But this is the internet no need to be productive  and I understand that you didnt ask for realism. Im not offended by the question I guess I just dont get it  my anxieties about birth are  wrapped up in the health of my baby not pain management not whether my husband will remember the aromatherapy diffuser though he very sweetly wrote himself a note when our PA mentioned it the other day. Im sure it would be different if I had fears about anesthesia or blood or needles. But honestly thats not where my fear or anxiety lies this is my fifth time being pregnant and yet no children. So Ill butt out. This question is not for me but then again neither are those about gender disappointment or having a surprise pregnancy. And thats okay.
