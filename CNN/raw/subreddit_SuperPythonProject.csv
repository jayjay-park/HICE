1990428,0,t3_2hglno,What type of game were you thinking? Like an RPG platformer or sandbox? I know that list is by far not comprehensive but you know what I mean. We could try cloning an already existing game make something like a d minecraft for example. That sounds like a challenge. Or clone a TRPG like Fire Emblem. I have a github account we could have the code on github. We can also cooperate through a remote desktop app and using skypetexting reddit pms are a bit tedious.,SuperPythonProject,ckt1oum,2,t5_33q6x
