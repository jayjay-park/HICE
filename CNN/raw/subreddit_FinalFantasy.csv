Im surprised he merited the environments though some of the textures in this game are just really bad.Dog Shoreline Cliff Train track not finished train clips into the skybox ..and many other graphical issues ranging from clipping to bad models I didnt take screens of or whatever. It is still a very nice game and Id recommend it for anyone who likes XIII or someone whos in it for the gameplay and doesnt want to take the story too seriously.

Even up to the point where he froze up when he had to make the shot it humanized him. However on the rest of the fronts youre pretty dead on. Quina would have been nice as a NPC but having her in the party gives a little comic relief. Eiko always pissed me off. Dont know what it was about her but she always pissed me off. Vivi was alright. Steiner was another form of comic relief. Now that I come to think of it... My party was usually Zidane Freya Amarant and Garnet as a healer. Freya sometimes was replaced with Steiner when I needed brute strength in a fight. Played  and it was pretty decent but after a buddy posted a picture of Tidus next to Meg Ryan I couldnt unsee that and couldnt take him seriously.

230569,0,t3_1wp3gq,I bought FF some months ago and ed the game within a few days. I really enjoyed it the fragment system which you collect kind of what makes it able other than the trophies is a nice incentive and useful to keep track of how good youre doing in each world version of each worldspoiler. The story is nice you get to see some old friends from FF and meet some new folks. The combat system is improved in my opinion and most peoples i think from the prequel however once you reach max level ATB speed weapons and some OP monsters for your team even the hardest enemies are no match for you but thats what you deserve for the grinding youll do if you want do it all and easy There are fewer different zones from  I believe but since you can freely travel through them unlike the linear patch of  if you play the game a bit longer it actually seems like theres more.To round it I think its definitely worth a buy especially if you can get it for a lower price.

319598,0,t3_1xqgen,Id have to say that  and  are arguably the most popular and wellreceived by the majority of people. is my personal favourite. I really cant count how many times Ive played through it. It never gets old. As far as games you need to play in the series I would list a lot          . has received a lot of criticism for being too linear among other things but I personally loved the combat system and I enjoyed the story as well. The game does open up so to speak and the endgame was very enjoyable for me. I truly enjoyed it. For sequels  is in my opinion a much weaker game overall but worth playing if you decide youd like to experience them all. Im not sure on this next point but its probably a good idea if you want to play Lightning Returns at some point.Like  the same goes with . Really not necessary to play and not even close to the quality of the others but if youd like to experience everything then go for it. Also  gt  for jobsystem.The only game I didnt complete was  thus I havent listed it. I personally got bored with it.The only games I didnt play are   .

348056,0,t3_1y1ywb,From a game mechanics standpoint I think that V is the most interesting of the main series games  the Job System is insanely deep and customizable and you can really make it your own. And its story shortcomings probably wont be too bothersome to you either After that Id say III a Job System similar to Vs XII the Gambit System is pretty great and it has a huge amount of side content VII the Materia System is brilliant IV kind of the opposite of III and V each character has a locked role so you have to learn to use them well II it has an interestingbroken leveling system which either makes or breaks the game depending on who you ask VI the Esper system is pretty great but the game is a little easy and then the rest in any order youd like. Play VIII last because the gameplay in that is IMO pretty poor compared to the rest. Spinoffwise Tactics has already been mentioned and it really is incredible  Id absolutely second that recommendation. ,FinalFantasy,cfgue9d,5,t5_2qhdi

It had moogles airships the Lucavi in addition to the Totema from FFTA.  It had the aesthetic and presentation of Vagrant Story so I was hoping that they would be bold enough to formally make it a prequel perhaps a story where the Zodiac Braves would be formed or the war that led to loss of the zodiac stones and the destruction of all technologygunsairships.FFIZJS didnt end up doing that but it would have endeared me more to the cast to know they had a more significant purpose to the overall Ivalice mythology.,FinalFantasy,cfq8dbx,2,t5_2qhdi

501882,0,t3_1zuzu8,Have you played X andor X before? If so Id go with LR. Youve already played XX so youd be better off playing something new. It offers quite the bang for your buck. I bought in on release and have sunk over a hundred hours into it. If it wasnt for the fact that I want to finish Bravely Default before XX releases Id be playing LR right now. Its a fun game with some nice replay value and great combat.If you havent played XX then just wait for the HD remaster to come out. Since youre a broke college student and dont have time to play a lot of games XX will offer two games for basically the price of one thatll last you for a while. so you wont have to worry about buying a new game anytime soon. XX are both great games so I know youll have fun with them give X a fair try since it is a lot of fun. Once you beat those two games there might very well have been price drop on LR so youll be able to pick up another quality game for less money.I think in your situation option  might be best but it is up to you. If youre a huge fan of the XIII games LR is definitely a must buy. The satisfaction I got from just playing the game and the ending was perfect for me. ,FinalFantasy,cfxbfvs,0,t5_2qhdi

Balthier was originally intended to be the main protagonist but the execs at Square couldnt really comprehend the idea of a game with a lead protagonist that isnt a  year old pretty boy hence Vaan.They couldnt rewrite the entire story that late into development which is why he has very little involvement in half the cutscenes past the beginning of the game why hes barely involved in the plot at all in the last third of the game.Everything in the story happens to the other characters in the game not to him. Hes just a bystander to it all.,FinalFantasy,cg7feiq,1,t5_2qhdi

689054,0,t1_cgijtij,Excellent writeup.Despite IV being my first game it by far isnt my favourite. Thats not to say the game itself wasnt enjoyable. It has very tight systems with not much in the way of party customization but as you say its this kind of character progression that made it so newcomers could fully engross themselves in what the world or genre rather had to offer without worrying about choice. I believe it is mostly because of this alone that many found it to be their preferred title of the series if it was their first.To this day I had been unsure of why I found the plot rather dull contrasting to the majority which love it until I read the last part of your comment. The vehicle Cecil which you use to move the game forward just isnt all that interesting. His internal conflicts pale in comparison to what is occurring around him and in my opinion he has little personal investment in the overarching story. Besides the little revelation towards the end which isnt all that compelling to begin with.Conversely I think a little slack should be given considering IV was the successor to three titles with blank slate protagonists. Or two titles really since II was the first attempt at creating a cast of characters with identifiable personalities.,FinalFantasy,cgili28,2,t5_2qhdi

I substituted one of the Stoneproofs with Ribbon from the Dark Matter I got collecting fiends in order to ensure no confuse would get the better of me.For Penance it was AutoPotion AutoHaste AutoProtect Defense This together with a buttload of XPotions and Megalixirs allowed me to defeat Penance  after researching a strategy online though.. I think that while the grinding is inherent to beating Penance and the Dark Aeons this provides a way which is not as tough in the grindingaspect  as it almost only requires you to grind for stat maxing  the equipment is easy to obtain afterwards.,FinalFantasy,cgj0gyn,2,t5_2qhdi

I was able to watch that back to back day after day.I also like the original DVD version better than the Bluray one. The pacing music lines voices everything felt absolutely perfect to me. The downside was that the plot was so curt that you had to watch it a few times to really understand everything thats going on but I like that. It gives us something to think about.

1100856,0,t1_chtcq62,Its not that theyd forget her  but that they wouldnt remember exactly what she looks like. And more importantly even if they did remember exactly what she looked like then I think youre underestimating how different Sorceress is to Matron and its about more than just looks although that is important.She dresses completely differently for a start  going from a very modest full skirt and jumper to a revealing vcut gown that draws attention to her breasts.  She goes from having pretty ordinary hair to having a crazy headdress. She also goes from having a normal face to whatever this weird thing is I dont think its fair to dismiss these as minor changes and I dont think it would be problematic to have them not recognise her immediately. Again Ellones presence can be swiftly dealt with either by a having the white SeeD ship come sooner or b having her appear later after the visions of the past have started. I dont think the changes would be major at all at most theyd be timing changes.As for them knowing each other  what changes would it need? All it would mean is theyd talk about knowing each other and cutting out the basketball court scene which if Ultimecia is not Rinoa is unnecessary at least from that point of view they could still have that moment be where they realise Edea is Matron  Trabia garden would still be fine for that.For  the only characters whose backgrounds were not explored were the optional characters and of those only Umaro and whatever Mr. Mimes name was were left ambiguous. In  everyones story is dealt with over the course of the game including the optional characters.  to a degree youre right but those stories are developed to an extent throughout the game...except for Amarant who I thought was a pretty poorly written character.,FinalFantasy,chtf88k,1,t5_2qhdi

1271432,1,t3_28ni0o,I completely disagree but thats totally cool the cool thing about Final Fantasy is that to each fan it means something completely different.As for my top  FFVI  What more really needs to be said about FF I remember the whole time being like holy shit the Super Nintendo can do this!? Also I got completely wrapped up in each characters back story it was all I could think about when I was in school. FFIX  When I first played this back in  I liked it but thought VII was better it wasnt until I replayed it last summer that I really appreciated what it was.  Probably because when I first played it me and my brother got into a huge fight over it it was the first awesome game that was mine and not my older brothers and I was a dick about it.  Anyways I would kill for a new Final Fantasy to have this design philosophy! FFXII  I was visiting friends in a different city and popped into a gamestop for directions then I noticed FFXII was released and bought it immediately.  After playing the demo with DQ I was ready to hate this game so bad but it won me over so quickly.  The intro still blows me away I loved tweaking the gambits I the thrill of trying to spawn rare enemies that I knew were gonna kill me but I was gonna steal that Gladius and run like hell.  I was so happy that this game was good in my eyes I was just about to give up on the series FFVII  my  through  are very tight and change day by day so dont get upset that VII is so low.  I love this game everybody loves this game who couldnt its a masterpiece.  I will concede that this is globally the best Final Fantasy but that doesnt mean it has to be my favourite.  The reason why I place XII above it is arbitrary really I knew from the start that this game was gonna be amazing and it was.  FFXII caught me by surprise like having a bad day and finding your bedroom full of kittens.  The only reason why I rank FFIX above VII is because from a modern prospection its incredibly refreshing.  Outside of those little things I really think theyre equally awesome. FFIV  I had a friend when I was maybe  or  that was two years older than me and he was the only person I knew that played and liked the original Final Fantasy as much as I did wed talk about it all the time.  Well a year or so goes by and the Super Nintendo comes out and then Street Fighter  comes out and everyone including myself is caught up in Street Fighter Fever.  I told my friend that Street Fighter  is the best game ever he asks me if Ive played Final Fantasy II.  I was stunned THEREs A FINAL FANTASY II!!! well shortly after that my brother saved up enough money for a Super Nintendo and bought a copy of FFIV from a friend of a friend and I finally got to see FFIV.  Suddenly I had a new favorite game. FFX  God I hated this game when it first came out I used to just sit and watch my brother play it and it made me so angry that there was no world map and the airship was a menu and the voice acting made it hard for me to read the text on the screen.  For a good  years I dismissed this game Im still not as crazy about it as others but I did come around on it.  When I finally came to terms with the fact that RPGs had changed  or  years later after Id finished FFXII I came back to it.  I really loved the story for this game and I like what they did to the ATB.  I liked Blitzball until I decided to get Wakkas super weapon tweaked out.  I dunno I like this game but it makes me sad for the same reason XIII does. FF  This game got romhack translated right when I was at the peak of my Final Fantasy obsession.  Of the three untranslated games this was the one I knew the least about FFII turned into a huge disappointment for me but this one looked like they righted the course.  This game was hard as hell holy crap I still cant believe I ever beat this.  At that time in my life I never thought I would ever be able to play this or any of the other lost Final Fantasy games and I felt so lucky to have the honor of playing it. FFI  Whats there to say? Its the original it was groundbreaking its amazing its aged poorly I love it I love III more. FFV  I love thinking about this game I love the job system I love the characters I love the world but for some reason I dont like actually playing this game so much.  Its weird Ive got nothing against it in fact theres only good things I can say about it but it just doesnt stick out for me.  Im sure theres people who love it to bits and I can understand that but it just has the unfortunate fate of being born between two of the best games Square ever made. FFVIII  pretty much the same as FFV for me for the exact same reasons.  I like how weird this game is I like the junction system hell I even liked grinding magic.  Also this game had such a bad ass intro song.  FFXIII  This game isnt as bad as everyone says it is but I still hate this game.  I had fun in Gran Pulse but Ive never had a game fatigue me so much.  I dunno this game just seems so pointless I dont even know why I liked it at all.,FinalFantasy,cicniwd,0,t5_2qhdi

1307069,0,t1_cigkb3u,The Memory option is useless on the Android version too.Android doesnt crash if you change screens although if you open two other apps while its open it closes itself. It does crash if you hit the back button. I havent gotten a phone call while playing so I dont know if that crashes it too.The Android version does have the Arcane Labyrinth bonus dungeon and a final boss for it that gets stronger as you do since you can run the Arcane Labryrinth several times for different rewards. Its an interesting idea but  floors gets tiring on a crashy phone.Autobattle is an idea FF is better off without anyway unless the AI is smarter than an old games autobattle feature ought to be. Even choosing the same target four times read holding down A is a whole round less efficient than manually selecting targets in many battles.Also PSP version statdowns say what?

I didnt know the name of the game but the menu music stuck in my head.  After that I always watched when he played it. He also played FFVI and VII. I must have been something like  years old at that point as I remember being in kindergarten and trying to get other other kids to play the part where Cloud falls trough the churches roof in FFVII. They wanted to be SpiderMan so it didnt work out. Even though I didnt understand english too well back then I started playing them in elementary school after I wanted to know where the song occasionally stuck in my head was from.

1892871,0,t3_2g9rc8,First all I really love that you dont complain about the games linearity.  Always thought that criticism was out of place in regards to the series.  As for me I loved . The characters and story werent the best the series has done but still solid enough to keep me invested.  The battle system was stellar also. It made the battles look amazing and was a good change if pace the series. For me the worst part of the game was the weapon uograde system but I got through it. Good game overall,FinalFantasy,ckha5ld,2,t5_2qhdi
1907635,0,t3_2ggmka,I preferred playing the patched NES version on an emulator.  Here were some thoughts I had True Job System.  Im normally not a fan of the job system but this one was very good though some jobs were worthless.  Im looking at you Scholar.  You were good for exactly one battle. Summons FTW!  It was the first time we saw summons in a game and for it being on NES it was very cool to see. The game is pantsshittingly hard.  Seriously this game will kick down your front door punch you in the face and kick you in the balls on the way down.  If I may take an excerpt from the good folks over at Hardcore Gaming ....WARNING!  THERE ARE SPOILERS KIND OF AHEADHere is how the final set of dungeons in Final Fantasy III work first you climb the Slyx Tower and fight a fairly difficult boss at the top. Then after some cutscenes you find yourself in the Dark World. You have to navigate your way through fight four well three of the most sinister bosses in any JRPG and then fight the boss of the game.While considering this you must keep in mind that Save Points still didnt exist yet. If you die at any stage of the process its back to the last place where you can save standing at the entrance to the Slyx Tower on the World Map. Climbing the tower takes a good twenty to thirty minutes. So lets say you get to the top for the first time and get killed by the boss. You load your game start over climb back up and defeat the boss. Then you get to the Dark World beat Cerberus but get killed by Echidna. So you start over  climb the tower beat the boss beat Cerberus and beat Echidna but then are caught unawares and killed by the TwoHeaded Dragon. So you start over. You climb the tower beat the boss beat Cerberus and then lose to Echidna because of a fluke. So you start over. Climb the tower beat the boss beat Echidna beat the Headed Dragon and then get killed by Ahriman. So you start over. You climb the tower beat the boss beat Cerberus beat Echidna beat the Headed Dragon and then get killed by Ahriman again. But this time you have a plan  you climb the tower beat the boss beat Cerberus beat Echidna beat the Headed Dragon beat Ahriman and are then completely obliterated by the final boss. So you try again. Climb the tower beat the boss beat Cerberus beat Echidna beat the Headed Dragon beat Ahriman and are then killed by the final boss even quicker than the first time. Meanwhile as all this is happening minutes and hours of your alltoo finite existence as a sentient lifeform on planet Earth are steadily and irrevocably being whittled away. Outside flowers are blooming. A sunset is casting the clouds and sky from crimson to dull orange to speckled violet. Shooting stars are blinking across the twilight. That old playground you visited every day as a child is about to be bulldozed. Old friends you havent spoken to in years suddenly remember you and wonder where you are in the world now. Somewhere a person youve never met and who could possibly be waiting for you has lately began talking to someone else a lot like you. And here you are twelve hours and fifteen tries into defeating the Cloud of Darkness totally certain that this time youll get it for sure.,FinalFantasy,ckj23ko,12,t5_2qhdi

2197539,0,t3_2k8sjz,Linearity It isnt that it is linear.  For me it is that it really feels linear.  In FFX for example you have to get to the Kilika temple from town through the forest.  You can only go from town to temple so it is linear but the forest has branching paths roads that cross each other.  While some parts of FF do open up a little most of it really is just one path you can walk.  It has a claustrophobic feeling to it for me.Battle system I like the battle system in concept.  Party leader dying  game over was fixed in FF.  I dont like the first paradigm shift pause for other than tactical reasons.  Some fights are start in SABRAVRAV debuffstagger switch to COMRAVRAV fight is over in  seconds but that shift takes up another  seconds of the fight.I am not a fan of the speed at which the battle system is introduced.  This may be due to my having played a lot of other RPGs in the past  years but it is very slow paced.  Other FF games  have lots of battle options available early on even if they are similar.  Do I want Kain to jump or attack?  Should Terra fight or cast fire?  Up until they open the battle system up in FF you can hit autobattle and get three attacks or hit abilities and choose attack three times.  If you are a RAV I guess you can manually mix two different elements if it makes you feel like youre doing more but you really arent.  Once you can choose a group and make tough decisions on your own it gets to be pretty fun.  It was new and it does mostly work.  I enjoyed combat a lot more in FF since it is just a better version of this combat system.  In  I get into a fight with three dudes and Im using RAVRAVSAB.  I target the guy I want to fight as a RAV and Vanille hits it with deprotect.  Id like her to follow up with deshell and imperil or slow or something but she randomly decides it is more important to deprotect the other two dudes instead of the dude Im trying to kill.  The  battle system provided so much tighter controls.  You cant use a COMCOMCOM effectively in  against more than one enemy as they just randomly target things.  In  I can have three COMs gang up on a target or tell them all to use AoE attacks and blitz the crap out of a group of tiny enemies.Story It is largely confusing with a lot of information buried in text.  Since the beginning of the game is already Fight an autobattle fight watch  minutes of cutscenes walk around the corner watch a few more cutscenes walk to a save point then watch more cutscenes I really feel the time could have been better spent telling me a story instead of watching Hope whine like a bitch or Snow go on a big hero speech.Like the battle system I feel like the story does get better further into the game but the beginning can be very long and boring and lead to feeling lost and discouraged from playing.PC port  I cant specifically comment as I dont own the PC version.  From what I saw of the vanilla PC game locked resolution frame rate etc it was a least amount of effort required port and Square should feel ashamed.  They should also feel proud that the community stepped in and fixed their lazy graphic design to make the game look far better on PC than it does on my PS.  Final notes  The game is worth playing if you like Final Fantasy games.  My first attempt at playing I made it maybe  hours in and just got so bored with the entire game I shelved it.  After hearing everyone who said it was good I gave it another chance and struggled through the first few hours and found it does actually get pretty tolerable.  The characters are not my favorites of the entire series the story is not the most compelling one in the world for me but it is not terrible.  ,FinalFantasy,clj5tpy,4,t5_2qhdi

2686105,0,t3_2qsnzr,For gameplay it was new and interesting to flesh out the job system. And though my first play through when I was younger didnt flesh out I enjoyed my next few playthroughs as I grew older and was able to appreciate Final Fantasy as a series. And actually understand what I was doing gameplaystats wise. Overall its story has a lot if buildup for what I would consider a confusing yet satisfying lackluster second half of the amazing buildup the first half of the story. Things fall in and out a lot and with no clear protagonist its hard to get immersed when youre trying to focus on all the characters and not just the major development of one. This I would say is the big reason as to why XII hasnt been as acclaimed as those that came before though overall as said before the following for XII is growing. Personally Ive yet to  percent the game though all I have to do is fish beat omgea mark xii and yaizmat but I have a tendency to take breaks before I go ham on FF again so I hope my dislikes are just enough for what you would like to see OP. With some happy thoughts sprinkled in.,FinalFantasy,cn96zm1,1,t5_2qhdi
2687668,0,t3_2qsnzr,I just beat  for the first time the other day and Im having a hard time coming up with a definite negative. I think the biggest drawback for me was the pacing of the game  it took time for the story to get interesting and then story sequences still seemed a bit few and farbetween especially just coming off of . The games difficulty level basically felt like you were supposed to do sidequests between major story points which really hurts pacing. Especially with the standard license board I never ever once had enough money to upgrade all of my equipment. Some people may have enjoyed this aspect of the game but I was split on it. On the one hand I appreciated the challenge and encouragement to explore the world on the other hand like I said it really hurt the storys pacing. Its a shame because looking back at the story its actually pretty well done and the localization is outstanding. I also dont think its a coincidence that I put the game down for a little bit during the journey to Arcadia. I didnt mind Vaan and Penelo as much as other people seem to although they were arguably the two least interesting characters.I may have just leveled up a bit too much but ultimately once I had good gambits set up the gameplay just felt very grindheavy and didnt seem to require too much thought in actual combat except for the boss fights once I had my gambits and it struck me as kind of dull.The way the game played overall struck me as more of an evolution of oldschool design with the focus on taking a long slog through a dungeon and surviving. This isnt inherently a bad thing and I can appreciate it for what it is but it was a bit tedious at times.Dont think I didnt enjoy my time with the game however my complaints with the gameplay seem to boil down to preference to me and it is an extremely good game overall  Im looking forward to getting back into the world to do the postgame content. I am very surprised I do not see more love for it on this sub.,FinalFantasy,cn9ec5a,1,t5_2qhdi

Though you could have it at x and turn up the aliasing manualy in the settings.Capping at  during cutscenes is veeeeery common a lot of games do that since cutscenes use higher res models and textures a lot of the time. The gummi area I cant comment but Im guessing it was built and hardcoded as a minigame at fps.If only there was a fix for the UI it the lowest quality thing there I look forward to when PPSSPP includes custom textures like Dolphin does its planned.,FinalFantasy,comxj14,1,t5_2qhdi

By that I mean got job level  for every job for every character.   Thats probably way above and beyond what some people consider complete but I loved the fuck out of that game.  I had a pretty interesting way to max jobs.  basically you reduce the physical damage output to  on  of your characters and one remaining enemy who should have about  remaining HP or so.  Then berserk everyone and walk away from the game for a few hours.  By the time the fight finishes you maxed a job.   Another thing I did was read all the Bio information for every character.

3502893,0,t3_305z9m,Tactics had a lot better job system with the JP system over Advanceds weapon skill system. Advanced allowed a much larger selection of charcters with more slots though so it gains points there.  Both of them had a fairly dark story with the political intrigue of Tactics and in Advanced the fact that you destroy an entire world simply so you can go back to the real world despite the fact that your friends are actually happy for once in their miserable lives. And you butcher your friends mom just so you can go home. This is on top of the fact that his father is finally more than just a bum and is actually important... So you pretty much just wrecked his entire family again.The laws system of Advanced can go die in a fire. That was a really shitty system so Tactics gains points for not having that.Advanced gains points for having a variety of races and more classes though IMO it loses points for limiting certain classes to certain races.In the end Id honestly put them both as equally good for different reasons. I liked the flexibility of Advanced in terms of being able to have a party for every situation since I actually had enough slots to do so but I hated the fact that it was necessary to do so because of the law system.  On the other hand Tactics did better with the actual leveling system since I wasnt reliant on weapon dropssteals to gain the abilities my class needed. I like both stories equally even if Advanced does start a little goofy. Theyre both kinda fucked up in their own right. I feel that Tactics lost a little in making story characters so much more powerful than your actual recruits since they have access to classes you cant get otherwise. I felt it detracted from the whole point of the game which was building an army from the basest of characters and turning it into a killing machine something Advanced actually excelled at. I was still using a random Viera in the end of the game even though I had story characters I could use because I had built her to be a thing of nightmares for the enemy party.I guess I really cant choose the superior game. Both games had their shortcomings that were improved upon by the other. Things that were lacking or annoying in one game were absent in the other game and things that were good in one game were screwed up as well. I still enjoyed both equally and thats good enough for me to say theyre both good games.,FinalFantasy,cprjz8f,1,t5_2qhdi

I just wrapped up Dragon Age and have been pretty active on that sub and at times it feels like thats all some people care about is who they can romance and see sex scenes with.

3517678,0,t1_cpt7dyh,You know I felt the same way the first few times I tried to play. It starts off really slow and you have very very limited options for the actions your units can take so its hard to be strategic and easy to get crushed in random encounters. I think I got up to the Dorter chapter like mission  or  pretty early several times and got murdered. You have to spend just a little time at the beginning building up and differentiating your units and the game gets SO much more fun after that. The possible job and ability combinations mean you can really customize your units in unique and fun ways. For a long time I was turned off by Tactics but now I would swear by it.,FinalFantasy,cpt8pby,2,t5_2qhdi

3540530,0,t3_30twlm,The two things on why this game did not do as well or is as well liked was due to the release date and the combat system.  FFXII was a game that didnt get much reception because it was released  months before Playstation .  So while the visuals were stunning for the Playstation  the graphics were unfortunately not as nice as the demos coming out for the Playstation . It is unfair but that was a huge reason why many passed on FFXII.As for those that played it but didnt like it the biggest complaint I hear is the combat system.  It was a little different than other FF games and it could be a pain to get used too.  I remember initially struggling to get the gambit thing to work right and was never really satisfied with it entirely even after a couple runs through the game.   Ive played both games and I will admit I like FFX better it is actually one of my favorite FFs.  While FFXII may have had a stronger visuals and more to do I still think FFX had a better story better characters though I will also admit Fran and Balthier were awesome and a better musical score.  There were definitely cheesy moments in FFX but so did FFXII running around yelling a fake name.... Overall it comes down to preference of what you look for in a game.

3582874,0,t3_31dlnj,Final Fantasy VI is by and large my favorite of the series and Ill explain why.It just has to be the characters throughout the game youll find someone that just really clicks with you. Someone you can either relate to or at least empathize with and it just gives you someone to root for. Sabin was definitely this character for me as his relationship with Edgar and his kingdom just really made me want to root for him. I will admit that a lot of the characters are pretty static but this only makes it better to see how they relate to each situation thrown at them. e.g. Sabin and Gau one of my favorite scenes.Following along the characters we have possibly one of the best villains introduced into any story in my opinion Kefka. I relate Kefka a lot to Iago the villain from Othello that I ended up writing my Senior research paper on. Kefka like Iago is absolutely pure evil there is nothing redeeming about him no other facets of his personality. Kefka only exists to be the epitome of chaos. In fact its hard to even consider Kefka evil in comparison to the other antagonists. Gestahl for ex. His actions are so reprehensible that I consider him amoral outside of the world of morals right vs. wrong that exists within Final Fantasy VI. This makes it all the better to yearn to defeat him because quite frankly he shouldnt exist in the world and its fun to take command of the complex and varied party that youre given as tools to bring about his downfall.Thats how I see it. Hopefully you can relate this to another game youve played and give Final Fantasy VI one more chance. Its not for everyone but its worth playing nonetheless.Ninja Edit I realize I didnt really answer the question in the title so here it is  The game can be considered split into two distinct parts. The nd part is when I immediately realized this was my favorite game and youre not terribly far from it. It gets better believe me.,FinalFantasy,cq0ocz4,2,t5_2qhdi

I think you are more emotionally invested in this discussion than I am since you just assumed it was me that downvoted you and then proceeds to insult me for it. I think more than  of FF players are female. I dont have statistics its just my feeling. Furthermore guys who complained about Mevuiss designs are butt hurt too so dont use the term as if it only applies to feminists because they cant handle sexualized females in media. How about a company sticks to their designs?  When women complain about games people say developers should t change a game they make to suit potentials players but thats exactly what Square did here. Which is a problem. It says men matter and women dont. I understand that a for profit company is going to try to make money as much as they can.  But by effectively telling women they dont care what female fans think Square will loose those fans and their money that they could have had if they just treated their female fans the same as their male fans.Either listen to all of us or dont listen to any of us.  Women play FF games too and our opinions matter as well. Edit  grammar,FinalFantasy,cq2bx2f,7,t5_2qhdi

Of course theres also the basic rule of diminishing returns to keep in mind as well. Its certainly a very polarizing title but I dont think its as universally hated as some people think it is. Its more likely that it just became a popular title to hate on so people jumped on the bandwagon and its fans naturally just kept quiet about it.

I see no indication for why they would become a couple. Could you be a bit more concrete?. Hope and lightning forged Several incredibly strong bonds with each other throughout the first game Getting odin coming to terms with his need for revenge him growing up her Growing Softer getting alexander..

He is the thing that literally melted her icy heart. if you remember at the beginning lightning is one stone cold bitch but ultimately grows softer and softer all largely due to the influence of his innocence and determination. . you think hope was just jumping through time only to help sera meanwhile ignoring alyssa who practically was throwing it at him for no reason at all? nah he did it because he wanted to see lightning againhe even says just this on multiple occasions,FinalFantasy,cqz72ng,1,t5_2qhdi

By allowing mixing and matching all materia you can build the characters anyway you want. If you want to have barred specialize in casting summons you can do that if you want him to be a very beefy front liner you can do that. Why take away that choice?  If you argue that they should be built to fit their characters back story or whatever no one is stopping you from doing that in your play through. Having such an open customizable system lets you pick your favorite characters to play rather than having to choose a character you dont like because they have access to an ability you need for a certain boss. ,FinalFantasy,cs84o2r,1,t5_2qhdi

Theyre going to turn it into an action game simplify all the gameplay down to nonexistance and then also automate it all so the game plays itself.  Nomura is going to ensure that style is given a thousand times more importance than substance and give everyone crazy outfits even though he designed their original outfits in the first place.  The plot though properly translated this time will somehow make even less sense.  If I keep making predictions Im just going to get madder and madder.I want this remake to be good but it wont be.  It wont live up to the original.

Id like to see new materia and new ways to combine and use materia.  Id like to see new limit breaks with some throwbacks to the popular old limit breaks.  I do really hope however that they keep the changes of pace.  The best thing about the game was that you are hunting an evil super soldier and encounter a little girl that is in trouble you save her from a monster but she isnt breathing so you give her CPR and save her life.  Then you after that serious moment you then have to pretend to be a shinra soldier and have to march in formation to get a prize from the announcer that is broadcasting a parade.  Too many games stick with serious through the whole game or they label themselves as a silly game and stay silly through the whole game but VII did a great job of keeping my interest by changing it up all the time.  ,FinalFantasy,cs9hrud,3,t5_2qhdi

4302616,1,t3_3a8xgn,I would honestly love to see the remake use a more party oriented version of the battle system in FFXV.  I know thats not what a lot of fans want to hear but when I think of FF its not its battle system.  Its the rich story lovable characters and its atmosphere.  Seeing its story and gameplay unfold in dynamic battles would be amazing and an entirely new experience and in my opinion a better one.  Super pumped either way and cant wait for a larger reveal. Edit  Am I seriously being down voted just for having a different opinion and enjoying more dynamic combat?  The old system was far from perfect I think people need to take the nostalgia goggles off and look towards the future.  Im sure Nomura and his team can deliver I just hope they dont listen to the longtime fans that are stuck in the past and actually move the game over to the XV combat system.  Give me that excellent story and those amazing characters with realtime combat please.  Why these diehard fans want games to stagnate I have no idea.  Let the game grow up let SE bring the world of FFVII into the future.  ,FinalFantasy,csamnzj,-1,t5_2qhdi
4303105,0,t1_csamstl,Well since Jim Sterling literally is God his opinion must be mine! Im glad thats not how reality works. I love the guy but I dont always agree with him.FF  has ALOT of problems no one is going to deny that. Its just one out of many of the FF games though. Im not sure why that immediately invalidates the entire company as a whole everything they did in the past or what theyre going to do in the future. They try new things which dont always work out and yes like every corporation in existence try to cash in on successes boo hoo. They still make things I enjoy and appreciate in general.I thought WoW was boring quit after a month or two.You surpass WoW by making something better. You make something better by trying to make something better if you never try youll never succeed.Blizzard has always strived to improve upon their concepts they would absolutely try their very hardest to create something unique that surpasses WoW. And looking at their track record I think they could do it too. Hell simply looking at the their patches and expansions the WoW of today can very easily be considered a remake of what it was in the beginning.All these arguments you give seem to state that we shouldnt try to create something better since it could possibly fail completely ignoring the fact that we got all these great games BECAUSE people tried to improve upon and build upon what went before.No I dont understand you.No risk no glory. I doubt theyre going to introduce a completely different system. Theyll likely make it more involved then hold X button until battle is over but keep many of its elements in there.Im part of everyone I would not be happy. The same boring slow fighting system would not make me happy. I want something more active and involved but based upon the original system. Besides the most important thing in an RPG is not the battle system IMO.How is that an argument? They own it so they should just make mediocre carbon copies? And that should be good enough? I think Jim Sterling would want a word with you.Im looking forward to the game hope the improve it where there is room for improvement and keep the immersiveness of the world and story intact.Only  delay?

Despite that fact it would take a long time to develop too fully fleshed Core battle mechanic systems. I really think everyone who has made this recommendation highly underestimates the cost and time of game development. If all you want is higher models with nothing else changed you can just get mods on pc. This remake shouldnt just be about better models. The game needs to be brought into the st century. Its also incredibly entitled and unfair to demand Squares devs to be creatively crushed. They shouldnt be suffocated by the nostalgia police fandom. They need room to breath.

4326480,0,t3_3ah1ma,I think you are undervaluing the younger generation. For my part I have never gone back and played most of the preSNES material. I played FFs  on the remastered or rereleased versions for other consoles. There is a certain point where the expectation and exposure the younger generation has been given by their culture growing up would cause them to look at graphics and be put off by that. It isnt their fault. You regularly call it art. I think the story is art. I think the character growth and interaction is art. The graphics and the combat system are secondary. They are a medium to tell this tale. FFs story taught me life lessons. It taught me  death is irrevocable. It taught me science and progress isnt always used towards good ends. It taught me that if you dont be true to yourself and grow as you are supposed to grow than you will easily be influenced by others Clouds will being hijacked by Sephiroth. These are all things that the Remake will keep because they are essential aspects of what makes FF Final Fantasy VII. That is where the art lies.Not to compare FF to Shakespeare but I am not bothered that movies are made of Shakespeare. I am not bothered that theatrical troupes still perform his plays today. They are not the original cast. They all look different and sound different. Their stages are modern and their behind the scenes work is all updated. That doesnt ruin Shakespeares Hamlet or Julius Caesar or Romeo and Juliet. It allows those vital pieces of culture to be carried through the generations. Sometimes they even update the language to be more appealing and more easily accessible to a modern audience. That doesnt detract from its worth as art.Like other works with multiple version or iterations FF will have fan favorite versions. Some will say the old version was better because it had this or highlighted this aspect. Others may say the coming Remake will be better because the better visuals allowed them to become more immersed. It will be about preference. Your views of appreciating the first one are perfectly valid but I think your views on reproductions of it are a little skewed. Doing it again doesnt insult it. It honors it. It acknowledges its greatness.Edit figured I should add in that third tying it together paragraph.,FinalFantasy,csdbnbh,1,t5_2qhdi

4340868,1,t1_csenu1m,gt Where is it impliedexplicitly spelt out that Hojo does anything sexual with Jenova?I think its fairly strongly implied throughout that Hojos motivations are more sexually predatory than scientific.  It seems to me that the entire story of Hojo Jenova and Lucrecia is a rape metaphor.Someone probably needs to write a really solid synthesis on this topic.  If you search the googles youll see that theres plenty of speculation but nobody AFAIK has put anything together in similar fashion to the Under the Highwind material.  It requires some reading between the lines but that doesnt mean its not clear and important to the story.The first clue is that Lucrecia is named Lucrecia.  This says to the player this person represents victims of sexual and political violence.  In the original mythohistorical account Lucretia is threatened that if she doesnt submit to the sexual advances of Sextus that shell be murdered and placed next to a murdered slave to make it appear adulterous.  Perhaps in the FF metaphor this murdered slave is Jenova.Jenova before the events in the Shinra tower is unable to be angry about what happened to her.  However when she awakens and reconnects with what has happened she takes on the form of Sephiroth.This is important to the story for a number of ways but I think that the most important is that Sephiroth represents the fury that his mothers werent able to express.Remember Sephiroth loses himself to rage only after reading the lab notes about what Hojo did to Jenova.  And  even though he knows at this point that he was born to Lucrecia he continues to call Jenova his mother.Theres no question that Hojo is a sexual predator.  I mean what the fuck led him to try to breed Aerith and Red XIII?  This too points to his fetish for Jenova.  Jenova is keenly able to change shapes but at that moment it had assumed one quite like a Cetra  like Aerith.Was he trying to prompt Red XIII whose softness and intellect he hadnt discovered to fulfil his fantasies for Jenova on Aerith a proxy?  Maybe.Does this material directly suggest that Hojo literally penetrated Jenova with his penis?  No of course not.

4352189,0,t3_3arqo0,Xenogears......Haha! Kidding kidding.All joking aside Im with the people saying Tactics because a you wouldnt really need to update the combat system at all and b it is one of my all time favorite FF games of ever forever.Outside of that and  though Im not sure there is another I think needs a remake.  With nostalgia glasses the old bit games are still more than playable the titles released after VII all aged rather well.  Sure they could look better but what age they do display does not necessarily detract from the abilty to enjoy the game.  VII on the other hand has become very difficult to play through the Steam version is an improvement but not by much which is kinda sad considering how impressed we all were when that game came out.....An arugment can be made for VIII that dont disagree with so Ill stick with that.TLDR Tactics and VIIIAnd Xenogears.,FinalFantasy,csg832k,2,t5_2qhdi

4366280,0,t1_csgzce4,gtsimply cant have the same exact same scenes and general moodThe exact same scenes no. There would be too much dialog for a fully voiceacted game... I think though the other final fantasy games have done it well. But as far as the events of each individual scene they could absolutely do it without changing the context. The dialog and choreography would just play out a bit differently.The mood on the other hand would be far far easier to convey. The highly advanced visual tools of modern day would solve so many problems. Extra detail goes a long way to giving the game a consistent themefeel. Thats a crutch they had to work around in the original.All in all they could definitely do a direct remake while maintaining the spirit of the game. Reimaginings... tend to be very different down to the story and events of the game itself. Im skeptical. I dont want to believe that this is going to be Advent Children the game but Ill hold my judgement for when theres more information.Whatever it is Im glad theyre doing it.

Kingdom Hearts is a good example of a game with a lot of skills and ways to approach a given fight. However you can very well just run in a hack away ignoring any of the magic and summons for most of the game. Its not bad but I enjoy turn based more and thinking  moves ahead in turns instead.

Whether it was a bug or inability to code properly well probably never know.Apart from leveling spells I definitely wouldnt call it tedious. It is IMO the most intuitive way of leveling. You fight with a sword you get better at using swords. You use magic you get better at using magic. Its also the one that is the fastest to level in when you know what youre doing.

I dont exactly know why but when I got that ending and saw Yunas face closeup I just bawled instantly. Something about the visuals of X and X give the characters faces more dialogue than the script and you could see everything she went through and did at that last moment. Tidus is gone and she spent all that time looking for him thinking shes found him. Then she gets jealous of Lenne thinking thats his new girl and it turns out he isnt Tidus and is going to destroy Spira. Thats all over but Tidus still isnt here and he probably never will be. It all just came together right there. Yuna had to accept that reality and probably became all popstary to scape it and now shes finally realizing that shes never going to get what she wants and its killing her inside to realize that.Might be true might be convoluted.

Then I heard the Xpack was coming out in a few days Id heard a lot of good things about the game since I quit and figured an expansion pack was the perfect time to jump back in. After all Id be able to jump in and start playing in the new content right? Flying mount new dungeons all that jazz.Fucking wrong. Way wrong. I had  patches of linear questing to do before it would let me get to the expansion content. By the time I finished it all and finally got to the expansion I was so sick of the questing. Then I got to Heavensward and... well I realized I was in for more questing. So I quit. Yeah Im an idiot. I bought an expansion and played maybe  levels of it.

The first chest is in front of Old Dalons Place. Why would you steal from your old friend?The second chest is inside the palace. Youre just here for the magicite why risk stealing anything else? The third chest is in the Nalbina Dungeon specificly the room where you get your equipment back. Why steal from those less fortunate? The last chests are randomly spread in a group of  chests at Phon Coast. Dont be greedy avoid those chests!

4687261,1,t3_3f45w9,Let me begin by praising the overall art design and fantastic focus on contrasting color schemes in each environment. The music is also enjoyable if somewhat bland in comparison to any other Final Fantasy game.This is where my praise of the game ends.My primary complaint about FF is that you dont so much play the game as you watch the game. In the first five hours of game play approximately two hours were comprised of the characters standing around reciting the same lines about lCie Pulse The Purge etc. FF is not so much a video game as a theatrical movie with some minor interactive portions.The dialogue is also bad... very bad. For a theatrical game that is composed mostly of prescripted FMV segments it would make sense to focus on coherent enjoyable dialogue. Instead the five characters insistently repeat the same nonsense over and over again. There are a few keywords lCie Pulse Purge etc. that are continually thrown out for effect with long unnecessary pauses. I get that Japanese culture is different but every time a character opened their mouth it felt like a teenage melodrama.The use of JRPG archetypes is also paper thinLightning Lead character is a woman so she has to be a cold callous cuntSnow Has to constantly announce his desire to save the worldhis GFHope Constantly gasping and making shocked noises of fearconcernSazh Token black guyVanille Literally the Jar Jar Binks of FFIn the game play department FF no longer uses the traditional random encounter style of action. In fact it doesnt use any type of recognizable RPG fighting design. Instead the game has literally incorporated an Auto Attack feature to strip the user from having to do ANYTHING! It is unconscionable for a game particularly an RPG to have an autoplay function.The user is transitioned into a bystander a passing observer instead of a participant in the game.The environments while beautiful are comprised entirely of narrow hallways and corridors. Again this is meant to restrict the user experience and bottle them into predetermined events and battles.TLDR  Terrible JRPG nonsense plot with nonexistent gameplay that panders to the modern crowd of graphicsfirst contentlater players.,FinalFantasy,ctldgad,-1,t5_2qhdi

Though that is way late in the game to wait for your healing spell angel whisper cannot be gained without manipulate at all since Pollensetta cannot be confused.Really though the run would just be overleveling to compensate for only having  characters able to do anything until nearly disk .  Without manipulate you have no healing at all for most of the run or big guard or most enemy skills worth anything actually.  Youd be stuck with matra magic magic hammer and L suicide for a while since there would be no feasable way to get Beta on your first time through with only one character using matra magic.  That would be an insane amount of grinding though fire resistance and sadness can easily help you survive the beta itself you still would need to grind until you could tank every hit while killing it with MM then tank beta itself.  After that the run would basically be over as you would be overleveled with an extremely powerful attack spell then just resetting hoping to get lucky with trine magic breath aqualung and shadow flare.,FinalFantasy,ctoknto,2,t5_2qhdi

They believe that PulseLindzei are on the other side of the Gate because they dont see them Pulse seems to be hanging out in the Historia Crux. The only FalCie who might be in direct contact is Anima who brings the main party to Pulse and gives them their power but Anima is a Pulse FalCie not a LindzeiSanctum FalCie and therefore not part of Barthandelus plan.For the Sanctum FalCie they have no contact with their Maker at all.

4799098,0,t1_ctza7fc,As much as it pains to admit they are one of the most important characters in terms of discussed here realism. Even though Vaan is considered one of the most blank and dull protagonists in the series by many and they are not wrong either he is very real. He is weak vulnerable youth unsure in everything and without established personality. Missing his brother that died because of that stupid war and also holding a grudge on the Empire which forced that war. And also carrying a simple and pretty childish dream of Being a pirate which makes him so much more alive. We all have atleast that one dream just for it to be there.Because he is an orphan. He is simple. So are his dreams and emotions. He is pretty straightforward because he is young as he is should be. And because of that he doesnt even have any real impact on the story which is the main reason he is considered a fail protagonist an it is wrong. He represents common folk or even below common. Other characters have their own agenda and mission to carry out that impacts story greatly like Balthier and Ashe. And Vaan is affecting their opinion and point of view greatly thus impacting those events the only real way possible by a simple human being. Because in the real world big things consists of them thousands small and simple.  Penelo is basically the very same thing as Vaan but a bit more tame and cold minded. She is there just to give a bit of depth and interaction to his character and also make sure that the whole simplicity conception sink into the auditory because it could have not if every character except Vaan was important.Think of other titles in FF. Main protagonists are young self centered with social problems or just plain infantile because of anime stereotypes and an appeal to young auditory that must personalize themselves with the protagonist. So they are becoming leaders and centers of the story. Grown and content people are following them and their very often completely not thought through and rushed decisions as it is a norm  no questions asked. As good and epic as it sounds for an anime style plot  This is not how real world operates. ,FinalFantasy,ctzgroo,2,t5_2qhdi

4914436,0,t3_3i7pai,I would say Final Fantasy IV and VI. The character development was really good in both. FFs esper system was also pretty cool and fun to play around with. The story for both of them was great though I may be biased since  is my favorite title.   Final Fantasy IX is a good callback to the classic Final Fantasy games . It was enjoyable from what I remember.   You could play VII as well. Its one of the most critically acclaimed FF titles and the most popular FF game as well. I thought it was cool since it had a lot for you to do. The story is good as well.   Final Fantasy Tactics isnt a main title  but it has an amazing story. It is an SRPG  unlike the others but it is a really fun game.  You can pick up War of the Lions the PSP remake of the game and enjoy!   EDIT   Final Fantasy XII I dont have a lot of experience in it didnt finish it but the story was top notch. Very politics focused than the other main titles  but they do it well. The game play is similar to an MMO and the gambit system is creative with a few flaws.  Final Fantasy XIII I thought the game was decent. The storyline started out good but started to kinda stagnate in the middle. The game seems very linear due to the removal of various cities and towns in terms of story structure it progresses like X but the removal of various cities and towns makes it so that you can only move forward. They made some bad game play choices if party leader dies automatic game over and the tutorial takes up half of the games hours not even kidding.   Sorry for the whole write up. I just wanted to give you all the info.    My recommendation would be  . VI  . IV  . Tactics War of the Lions . IX . VII,FinalFantasy,cue02rw,1,t5_2qhdi

Sounds worse than what Jecht has too. Then theres Golbez... Good guys can be on Chaos side. Id like to see Sazh take the role of SpellBlade since he has the buffs to do it on all party members rather than it be  characters gimmick. Sazh would be useful to supprt physical fighters like WoL Cloud and Firion. And let Celes be like a Red Mage. But then i feel thats how theyll use Ramzabenjamin so maybe select some else for ? We dont have a Moogle yet...or a Cid for that matterAnd Minwu is probably the best choice for a White Mage except maybe Rosa but id still rather see Rydia or Ceodore if were adding more  characters,FinalFantasy,cui16ez,2,t5_2qhdi

5001413,0,t1_cuotw4d,The problem with videogame movies is that people want the same feelings as when they played the game OR they are shoved full of expositionbackstory so the nongamers dont get confused.  Videogame movies are almost set up to fail because movies cant give you the same feeling as playing the character. In a movie if the main character dies it is that character but in a game it isnt the character dying but the player is dying. Silent Hill had the best potential to break away from the pack as they could have told a horror story... Instead they make a crappy movie with cliche lines and a M. Night Shamlamadingdong type ending. The reason FF Spirits Within works as a movie better than the others is because it is FF. The players should know hey new universe new rules... so they dont get stuck needing to be faithful to any source material. Also since they could tell a new story it wont be another origin story type deal where the fans will be omg I know how Peter Parker gets his spider powers... Do I need to see this AGAIN?... However Square did two things that hurt them. Underestimated how much the fans wanted a FF movie and they put to much money in the movie to make it down right fucking beautiful for the time. I bet it cost them an arm and a leg for the almoat all star cast Alec Baldwin Steve Buscemi Dolnald Sutherland James Woods. Roger Egbert gave the movie a ..

5040567,0,t1_cutkbqq,Some extensions Celestia knew she was going to die by the hands of the militesi empire. I think the crystals actually knew and orchestrated everything to go to war and that all the crystals are united. There is a video about this actually in the game. I think after you finish the game you can see in the library option or whatever is called. There Machina finds Qunmi and etc. I also think Cid knew that in order to become Agito all the crystals had to belong to only one nation. My impression along the game was that he didnt care to be losing the war because he had  crystals already and didnt matter who posses the  of them. He didnt give a shit about his country or anything.Also why did he want to be Agito? He went to the temple thing talked with the god there and killed himself when he learned....what? The video about this is not very clear so yes the final boss is not really Cid is a possessed Cid In all iterations the  become lCie and die. In this one they chose not to and then is when Rem is chosen for it. One could say that if Rem and Machina transfer their powers lCie to them momentarily and they become temporary lCie isnt the same than if they were lCie? Who knows the ending of the game is kind of weird Squaresoft style. The most important part is that all the other iterations more than  millions they chose lCie but not this time like really? what are the odds of that?,FinalFantasy,cutkv9h,2,t5_2qhdi

5105432,0,t3_3kwx99,It fits right along with those s games like Mystic Quest FF Adventure FF Legends .  Its a nonFinal Fantasy game that received the brand purely for marketing purposes.Square did an outstanding job supporting the PSP.  The best ports theyve ever done Tactics Ogre Final Fantasy  were on this system.  It saw original content like Crisis Core Dissidia Kingdom Hearts BBS.  Some of the finest games for the entire platform.But they also had some that didnt attract much attention like Lord of Arcana.  Nearing the end of the systems lifespan I can only assume they stuck this one with the FF brand to keep it from sharing that fate.Technologically it was a really good PSP game.  The graphics were top notch for the system the real time combat system was manageable for a single joystick and the game was two UMDs so it was a lengthy full featured game on a portable system that was more accustomed to knockoffs.As a PC game or something to run against the major console games its going to be disappointing.  It simply wasnt intended as an A title relative to those standards.So dont buy it as a Final Fantasy game.  Its better suited for diehard jrpg enthusiasts who like digging through oddities.,FinalFantasy,cv1e8ax,2,t5_2qhdi

5111277,0,t1_cv1le8d,I never understood this complaint with FFXIII. You can beat every single FF game by just mashing Attack with all your characters with a handful of exceptions during certain boss fights. Id consider FFXIII one of the harder main line FF games though it is more forgiving it that it allows you to retry battles. People who claim you can autobattle your way to victory in that game havent cleared past chapter .,FinalFantasy,cv23mjy,4,t5_2qhdi
5111687,0,t1_cv1ov3s,Ehhh I respectfully disagree with your statement. Calling a story overly complicated yet surprisingly shallow is a fallacy. The overly complicatedness comes from the huge amount of lore and new terms that are brought into the story without tutorialing it to the player first. It is a bit frustrating that you have to search for the lore via the datalog if you want to completely grasp all the information being thrown at you but even if you didnt the lore isnt so important to the story that without it youd be left lost. Also I dont think shallow is the right word to describe the story. Its simple. It is a character driven drama that involves our main characters being caught up in a huge world issue and have been forced to run away to somewhere they can find shelter whilst they figure out how to escape from their predicament. As they continue on their journey they discover intrigue danger corruption and are forced to make a life or death decision at the end that will not only let them escape from the fate theyve been forced upon but will also change the lives of everyone. Personally I think it was wellwritten. And since the focus was the characters rather than making the plot super intricate it was well executed too. ,FinalFantasy,cv25edv,1,t5_2qhdi

5458578,0,t1_cw8u5b9,so... my nice big reply accidentally got deleted  lemme try again. Thanks for reading and responding.I definitely forgot that LCie dont just die if they dont complete their Focus thanks for explaining that point for me again. I also totally forgot that the party turns into Cieth but I think thats because that plot point was pretty inconsequential right? They turn back pretty quickly. Like you say about living dead fiction there is often a character who is bitten by a zombie and is then forced to make an agonizing decision. And like you say they usually shoot themselves  they are invoking one last act of agency before their agency is taken from them. You see this plot point a lot and I think its because just seeing zombies or Cieth walking around doesnt impose a raw sense of tragedy on the viewerreader  we have to watch one of our own a main character be forced to make that decision. As I mentioned this is what I wanted to see  at least one character who was truly faced with these choices a kill themselves b become a Cieth or c do something terribly heinous. At least one should not have gotten magical option d none of the above. I mean I think it would be great if two are faced with it simultaneously and we find out one ended up killing themselves rather than do the bad thing and one DID do the bad thing in order to survive Sazh would be a great one for the latter because hes just trying to get home to his kid without him Dajh has no one. I think thats the only way to really show those kinds of stakes. I mean yeah its dark but zombie stories are pretty much inherently dark if you face up to it.I like your argument about the worldbuilding you make a lot of good examples that got me thinking about the fact that Cocoon is a really wellmade setting for those themes. I think if the game mostly took place in Cocoon instead of Grand Pulse then those examples and others along those lines would really shine. It would push those themes to the forefront as we experience them in real time. I think experiencing those things in the present as we play is so important. Im just gonna pull an example out of my ass to illustrate what I mean haha  we start the game when Lightning still works for the government and is complicit with propagandacrowd controlforced enlistment or some other arm of the government. Then Serah is taken  Lightning tries to go through the system to get her back but she is stonewalled because the government does what it wants and it doesnt care what you think she then goes outside the system and we see her fall from grace as she loses the governments favor and gets on its bad side. All of a sudden all these things that seemed nice and pretty before albeit perhaps with a slightly unsettling bent that Lightning might have ignored because her life was comfortable are ripped away and we must deal with the dark underbelly of extreme authoritarianism etc. etc. etc. I think something like that would maintain the same worldbuilding of Cocoon as well as a number of the primary plot points of the story but also allow the player to really experience the theme you have described.,FinalFantasy,cw9dvdf,4,t5_2qhdi

5499383,0,t1_cweh0gm,gt Haha nice. I do remember reading in PC Gamer UK in a preview article about Final Fantasy VIII stating that FFVII sold poorly even though PC Gamer liked it. The graphics on the VIII port did make some steps forward partly because the models looked better in the first place the FMVs were DVD quality the music quality was better and a smidgeon of filtering was put on the backgrounds better than nothing I guess. However the menus looked worse than VIIs though the resolution was still locked and the world map was a mess. Given how VIII divided opinion and certainly didnt play as well though the story was epic it probably didnt sell so well either.,FinalFantasy,cweljhy,1,t5_2qhdi

5605897,0,t3_3rw4h6,Eh no offense but I think you just might not be very good at preparing for your battles.

5665259,0,t1_cwz8f76,Yes it is amazing because Cloud is one of the things that represents the rise of the PlayStation era and the end of the Nintendo eras and the end of the Sony SNES CD partnership.  Many final fantasy fans flocked to Sony when Squaresoft decided to move the final fantasy franchise to PS with starting with FFVII although other factors also led to PSs great sales of course.   And since then the relationship between Square and Nintendo has been a touchy subject.Lets hope this leads to better a releationship between Square Enix and Nintendo. Sure things between them have gotten better in the mid s releasing final fantasy spin offs and  been pumping out great games like the bravely default games of course but Nintendo hasnt seen a mainline FF game since SNES. If the NX is powerful enough maybe we will see a port of FFVII remake and FFXV.I also just love how Cloud was revealed in Smash bros in the same year a working prototype of the Sony SNES CD Play Station was discovered.,FinalFantasy,cwzbwqz,2,t5_2qhdi

5677650,0,t3_3pfjy5,Im way late coming to this but what I reaaaally want from the FF series is to not do what every other big game series seems to be doing and unfortunately looks like XV will fall into and thats just trying to turn every big release into the same open world craftingbased action rpg where everything is decision based and theres no definite storyline.The popularity of games like GTA Mass Effect and Elder Scrolls titles has really messed with the idea of games. Every game needs to have karma systems a completely open world cos god forbid you be forced to play the game you paid for and loads of customisation.Frankly its not needed. Games can have a linear storyline that gets told through gameplay that doesnt turn it into a Farcry game. IMO this style of game design made Metal Gear Solid V weaker and could make Final Fantasy games suffer. Pure linearity isnt great I didnt like FFXIII for a few reasons but what we had from like IX never played XII so I cant comment was great and could easily have improvements without messing with anything.Of course I dont know enough about XV to get as passionate as I am getting but this trend really gripes me! People seem to hate the idea of any kind of storyline aspects that they cant change or have an evil option or whatever. Whats so wrong with a story with an ending!?!,FinalFantasy,cx0v9vg,4,t5_2qhdi

Sazh is still undetermined and Vanille has already decided to run from her problems.She decides to run away? Im super excited to see all the crazy things shell do running away. No seriously there isnt a single drop of motivation with the plot for about  hours. Seeing a bunch of people running away and talking about it in over dramatic cutscenes is not really fun at least to me. But hey like you said thats just my opinion.gt The absolute first cutscene you even see a Cieth Vanille explains what they are. lCie and falCie are also explained several times throughout the game.Sure the problem really is only Falcie and Lcie lets ignore all the Coccoon Pulse PSICOM Guardian Corps Sanctum Purge Ragnarok... My point is that these things are badly explained or not explained at all. I remember having to read a lot of stuff in the Datalog because there was simply a lack of explanationwasnt clear enough. Surely Im not the only one who feels that way.gt Boohoo they dont send you  floors down in a dungeon for  potions and an ether.And youre telling me youre a FF fan? Alright.gt Did you not even get to Pulse or what? Anyone who has ever gotten there without attacking either a Behemoth King or an Adamantoise either pussied out or played with a guide that specifically told you not to attack them.By getting killed by super high level Cockatrices I was trying to express the freedom the player has in the older titles. Freedom to explore places he isnt supposed to. Youre supposed to reach Pulse in a determined time in XIII and even though I like the area a lot its not even close to the freedom of old FFs maps.gt Ill take Things people complain about FF V for .Surely you dont understand the importance of these actions to the immersion of the player in the respective world. NPC interaction is a really important element for immersion and one that the old titles have and XIII lacks.gt Level up being the majority of the stat boosts in the older games really brings this point across.Ah yeah not leveling weapon skills in II jobs in III jobs in V materias in VII spells and GFs in VIII etc etc. Level up is all about the stats really. What we need is a FF where you have no control and just press forward to level whatever the game wants you to. Damn wish XII was like that.gt I have no idea what constitutes a veteran seeing how most people call themselves veterans nowadays but Ive been playing FF for over half my life  years and all I can say is that XIII is my favourite.Im  and I played FF VI in an emulator when I was  so guess that makes me a veteran? No not really. My view of a veteran is a person who played allthe majority of the series.gt I dont think any part of it is a down grade of any other game. Even if some things are similar to other games which long running series doesnt reuse elements?All Id like to know is why XIII gets shit for things that are in the other games when those games are praised for having those things?From your arguments I can tell you didnt come here to discuss about XIII and express your opinion. You came here solely to protect your precious game. If you want to discuss why some elements are not a downgrade compared to older titles Id happy to do that Not really because I dont really like talking about XIII haha just dont come here with shallow phrases being the overprotective older brother of XIII or something that adds to nothing.gt Because people have differing opinions. I dont understand how people can like IV and VI hyperbole of course I can understand why they like them because to me theyre at the very bottom of the list.Cool isnt it nice to talk about games and why some people enjoyed it when some didnt?gt Wat?Was trying to say that XIIIs soundtrack is very inferior to mainly the games that came before X when Uematsu was working on it.

Ive been trying to track down a good looking Griever ring to use as a wedding ring and I havent had much luck. There are the SE officials of course but they dont have the correct wing from the game and they are going for about  on ebay. I didnt want to spend that much money on something that isnt one hundred percent true to the game so I ordered two different knock offs from Hong Kong. One of them has already arrived and its... okay. Its a good mimic of the SE version so obviously I have the same problem with the wing not being correct. The other hasnt arrived yet but from pictures I already know I will have the same issue. So if you have a hookup of where to get one maybe custom made I wouldnt mind paying for a quality product. It seems there used to be someone that could make them because Ive seen pictures of them and theyre beautiful but I have no idea who it is.,FinalFantasy,cxmyyge,1,t5_2qhdi

The gameplay is also pretty weird since enemies level with you kind of destroys the point of leveling and its extremely easy to break the gameplay and make your characters insanely overpowered at pretty much any point of the game.FFs card game is a lot of fun though.,FinalFantasy,cxrfe8f,1,t5_2qhdi

Sure wed like to believe she can live a peaceful life but the novellas tell us that humanity without the falCie to rule them is at its own throat. Not to mention any other threats that might exist. And Claires still got remnants of both Etro and Bhunivelzes powers probably so shes still a Warrior Goddess.

5912910,0,t3_3w4ylw,Yeah  is pretty weird. And it did do a lot of things really REALLY well. Things that really go unsung like much of what youre pointing out in your post.This was the last FF for me that didnt feel paperthin in terms of story the dialogue and character writing is handsdown the most clever and believable in the main series and the combat and gambit systems were so brilliant Id have been happy with SE just doing that for the next  or  games and making it the new standard like ATB was for so long.I didnt hate Vaan like so many seem to and besides the squandering of Ivalices potential for racial diversity in a party  out of  are humes? Wheres my bangaa? Wheres my seeq?! I was satisfied with the cast. Especially Ashe. Do not cross that chick.Here are my complaints though I realize that this was a result of an emergency director swap but the story really does lose its way about halfway through. It makes a hard left turn from Politicstown into Ancientgodsville and its a little offputting to me. The shared homogenized license board completely destroyed the purpose of the gambit systems ability to craft and coach a diverse and collaborative party instead resulting in  people swinging greatswords and flinging every aga spell like snowballs. It never forced you down a path which made leveling just tear the ceiling off your characters and make them mechanically identical and uncompromised. This is nothing new for FF but when paired with what basically felt like tactical MMO combat controlled by a single player I was hugely let down by how much power I actually had to work with. This is why after playing the international version which permanently locks each character into a specialized job class and forces you to make better use of skills and spells youd never consider using originally I simply cant go back to the original release well this and several other awesome changes that were made. All of the most badass party members are guests. The plot usually makes sense of it but as a gamer I was always frustrated when yet another kickass guest would part ways.I dont like how little recognition it gets these days either though. When it came out it seemed like everyone was saying it was what Final Fantasy was supposed to be then XIII seemed to make us all so busy hating each other with how divisive it was that XII has become a bit forgotten in the general conversation. But I really thought they had something. A great jumpingoff point for a new direction before SE became so seemingly beholden to change everything every time except for how good it looks to the point that the series identity is now a shattered mess of desperate attempts at innovation from a gameplay standpoint and inhumanly saccharine storytelling with no shred of believability.But I digress.

However Im reading some mixed stories as to whether this is okay. Some state that you shouldnt begin talking to them at all starting chapter  while some say its okay to talk to them up to chapter  at which point you should ignore them throughout the entire chapter.Its been a while since I last played it but here goes.... You must not recruit Carla Mutsuki Quon and Ryidspoiler in the st playthrough. Otherwise you will miss out on their special dialogues in the last chapter. Furthermore if they are recruited in the st playthrough they will remain recruited for all subsequent playthroughs.You can talk to them and complete a portion of their side stories in the st playthrough without recruiting them. However this will only be wasting time as you still have to go thru their entire sidestory to recruit them.gt cactar?Are you talking about the Academy Cactuar that roams the Akademeia?

6025345,0,t3_3xyud0,I was probably  at the time. The year was . At my cousins house playing Final Fantasy  for the SNES.  year later when i had my own SNES my parents would take me to the game rental store and i would rent Final Fantasy  every weekend hoping my save was still there that next week sure enough it was. Sometimes id come back and it had been progressed further didnt really bother me much back then i mean come on i was . About a year later we moved out of state and had to sell my snes before we moved but luckly for my th birthday my mom bought me a new SNES and took me to a store so i could buy any game i wanted for it. They didnt have Final Fantasy ...i was sad. But after looking a little bit longer i did notice another game. Final Fantasy III for the snes. I was like hmm why not i reallyed liked Final Fantasy II this should be just as good. AND IT WAS BETTER! WAY BETTER!Unfortuneately the game was also a curse for me for YEARS to come. I was to stupid to figure out how Blitz worked i mean give me alittle credit i was  at the time. I leveled for so long on top of that mountain that Terra learned Raise Level  before i finally got super mad and button mashed everything during that fight and somehow got past it. Even when i got older i tried replaying the game to beat it but even my older self got angry and my past for never figuring it out because i still couldnt figure it out and my friends had to show me and it was an awful experience.,FinalFantasy,cy9g0m2,1,t5_2qhdi

6451779,0,t1_czm22jg,XIII cant avoid comparison to IV because theyre two of the most railroady games in the franchise especially in character development. VI constrains the player so much less that it only comes up as the extreme example of nonlinearity in FF.Also talking about characters and emotional reactions to their scenes feels less objective and shareable than story structure or pacing. I think that XIII is far worse than VI at making you care about the characters and feel their pain but I couldnt explain why nor could I refute someone who claimed the reverse.Edit Im still convinced that many of s problems are that the parts fit together so badly. Dungeon crawler? Those work. Hallway dungeons? They go back to FF. Weak plot focus on character development? FF is loved for that. Alien world with deep lore? FF does a good job.But dungeoncrawling  hallway dungeons  weak plot  alien world doesnt work well. IMO dungeoncrawling wont work with hallway dungeons or an alien world and a weak plot and an alien world together cause difficulties.Edit Dungeoncrawling and a weak plot work fine together.

6500926,0,t3_44je0d,Chrono Trigger and Legend of Dragoon come immediately to mind. Chrono Trigger might as well be Final Fantasy . theres very little that makes it not a final fantasy game although at the time it stood out because the Final Fantasy house style was a little bit more rigid than it is today. Legend of Dragoon at the time felt like Final Fantasy VIII for everyone who thought FFVIII was too scifi. It has a great cast a medieval feel a really good plot and a very final fantasy feel to it. I tried replaying it recently and its aged quite a bit but its still a good game. Id echo love for Legend of Mana but also suggest Secret of Mana and its sequel. Earthbound and Persona  have very different feels and styles to the Final Fantasy series but are probably the two greatest RPGs made Id probably only put FFVII in their league from the FF series. Maybe VI. If you havent played them but like RPGs you kind of owe it to yourself to try them. Although now that I think about it both games are strict turn based. ,FinalFantasy,czrqtlt,3,t5_2qhdi
6507536,0,t3_44rufh,Major Spoilers for both Final Fantasy XIII Lightning Returns and TypeI am only about  hours into Type but that is deep enough to get quite a bit of the story. I just got to the part where Class Zero is being framed for the murder of the Queen of ConcordiaspoilerThe deductive process the class goes through to figure out that the chancellor and Kurasame are still alive since they still have memories of themspoilerNow the big conflict in Lightning Returns was that BhunivelzeThe Order wanted to destroy all of the lost souls so that they can be forgotten and Humans can live without the burden of the pastspoilerLightning stops that from happening... BUT... That is the exact world that the people of Type live in. There are crystals that control everything and are not to be gone against. They are the strongest willkinda in the world. They bless people with the powers of a Lcie and remove the memories of the dead so that people are unaffected by lossspoilerThis world seriously looks and feels like an alternate reality in which Bhunivelze wins and his new world is created. Lcie are revered and praised beings of power and respect rather than fear and hate them for what they are. The world had been existing in relatively good peace where humans could be happy. If someone dies there is no mourning over their loss as the crystals remove your memory of them. etc. This the world the Bhunivelze wantedroughly. He just made Crystals instead of FalCiespoilerI know that type zero started out as Final Fantasy Agito XIIIMade even more obvious by the constant reference of whatever Agito is supposed to be in the story of TypespoilerThis isnt so much of a question just something really fun and possible discussion sparking.

IVs story and characters are always trying to maintain a serious tone with classic fantasy fairy tailish lines and that doesnt work very well for me. Vs silly tone and characters made me really enjoy that setting. Bartz was surprisingly a fresh protagonist for me in all his regularness. I was thinking this guy is here just because he went along for the ride I know nothing about him yet in fact less than the other members of the party but Im guessing some weird shit background is going to catch eventually. Then no he in fact is just an adventurer with a healthy relationship with his parents. So far he was the least influencing of the group in the plotdriving sense and I just happened to stumble upon his hometown to learn more about him.

6674807,0,t3_4728mm,I dont use shadowbind at all so i cant answer that part.For your other question oui heavy slash turns to artemis arrows in SoP garb. Arguably the best ability in the game cause it ignores defense so when you staggered an enemy AA will be a great finisher. Be prepared to grind alot to maxd it though and it uses quite a bit of atb. If i may i have two other damage dealing optionsFirst would be Whirlwind Kick from Martial Monk garb. With perfect timing it could deal more damage than AA. But only if you think youre good at timing. Otherwise nevermindSecond and its my favorite ability from the game is this rare autoability called Deprotect Hunter. Heres what you do first you need Light Slash ability. If you can stomach it max this ability could take a while but much less grindy than maxing out Heavy Slash. If not just get the best statd Light Slash. Once you get that starts farming Deprotect ability. Triffid and Goblot are good sources for this. Once you have enough Deprotects  or so synthesis them. The goal is to get Deprotect Hunter rare ability. Might take awhile if you still havent got it after you synthesisd all of your deprotects soft reset and resynthesis to avoid grinding and whatnot. Again may take awhile.Once you get it the fun begins. Put both Deprotect with Deprotect Hunter rare auto ability attached and Light Slash on your damage dealer garb. During a fight cast deprotect to an enemy and your light slash will automatically transform to Deprotect Hunter. The damage will increasy VERY SIGNIFICANTLY. My maxed statd lightning deals k with maxd Light Slash but when its turned to Deprotect Hunter it dealt around kk damage per slash. And it costs like  atb. Which is AMAZING and even more savage on Overclock mode cause Lightning slashes faster. The only downside is it doesnt have finishing move. so you basically just slash slash slash. But i am perfectly happy with that. Sorry if you already knew about it. Thought i throw in some ideas,FinalFantasy,d09qe7g,2,t5_2qhdi

Perhaps over time a god could become more powerful and approach a state of near omnipotence but that does not mean that lesser gods wouldnt still exist or that lesser gods did not pass on before.Just because there are summons without the need of materia doesnt mean anything. Materia was said to be the ancient knowledge of those who died ergo in the world of FFVII there were those that once knew how to summon and use magic without materia.

They introduced some high level elements and  characters Noctis Stella  bros prior to the relaunch as FF.

Even with FFX a game that on its surface looks like pure TB actually has elements of ATB behind the scenes giving characters variable turn orders depending on their speed and what they do.

Theres still a lot to be seen and at this stage we know very little. XV for example has always had an actionbased combat system since the versus XIII reveal but has gone through dramatic changes since then. I want there to be changes because I like the nostalgia of playing the original exactly how it is now but at the same time I dont feel like every bit of that system is going to be abandoned based off of what we have seen and heard so far. ,FinalFantasy,d1z7isg,2,t5_2qhdi
7229190,0,t1_d1zw3yu,I understand the events within the context of the game I just dont understand it from a political point of view. Im not sure youre quite getting what Im wondering aboutGalbadia Garden exists as a sister institute for Balamb Garden to draw SeeD applicants from. Galbadia Garden also exists as a font for Galbadia to draw recruits for their military. In addition SeeD has and has been for quite some time operated against Galbadia in a military capacity for years quite effectively. The same SeeD that gets many of its recruits from G Garden which also is a source of Galbadias military talent! G Garden isnt just any other school its one of the Three Gardens that students must originate from and receive training from to become a SeeD. Why does Galbadia Garden allow this situation exist that clearly is a mutual interest to their own? In the middle of the game Galbadia the country takes over G Garden severs its connection to Balamb Garden and works to eliminate SeeD from the equation. Some time before that they tried to blow them up with missiles.Why are they just now doing any of this? Even if the long range missile plan was an extreme measure if nothing else why didnt Galbadia take over G Garden from the jump? A lot of G Gardens students transfer over to Balamb to become SeeDs which are one of Galbadias most effective adversaries. Why didnt Galbadia sever this connection to begin with?,FinalFantasy,d1zwlg5,1,t5_2qhdi

Tiduss came from... Racing Chocobos that hes barely even ever seen. Lulus comes from... Dodging lightning this wouldve been a legitimate task for Rikku? Kimahri... Catching butterflies. What?

7475433,0,t1_d2rw3ix,Keep in mind p video is . times larger in terms of resolution so the prerendered cutscenes which likely consume a sizable chunk of the disc will grow a lot. Most of the rest of the disc is likely texture data. I bet the new remastered music is larger too. Only major thing that is likely the same size is the voice acting.Even if those assets are only doubled wed be seeing the original GB go to at least GB off the bat. Its easy to imagine much more than double especially considering the cutscenes.,FinalFantasy,d2rww5t,5,t5_2qhdi

Animations arent so large models are tiny so its mainly textures taking up the space.Of course the Prerendered cutscenes are large too certainly the bigger space on the disk.Im mentioning specifically textures because all people said about it being larger is that it has new models and textures not until further in did anyone mention the prerender stuff.

7505830,0,t3_4i5po3,I think X had the best opening chapter because of what it accomplished. Were introduced to the main character and Auron asskicker extraordinaire. We get to see Zanarkand which is talked about through the rest of the game. Were introduced to Sin the main antagonist at least for most of the gamespoiler and get to see its destructive power firsthand. We see blitzball another concept important to the rest of the game. Theres constant action throughout up until the player gets taken away from Zanarkandspoiler.In addition to all that this is also where the game teaches the player about the basics of movement and combat without having to slow down much to do so.VIII had the second best opening in my opinion. Not because of the cutscenes and Ifrits cave but because of the Assault on Dolletspoiler that comes after it. The setting and music of that part is one of my favorite events in FF but I couldnt technically call it the opening since it can take around an hour to get there if youre new.,FinalFantasy,d2vdhh9,17,t5_2qhdi

7522661,0,t3_4himpf,Could someone please share some tips to help me get into FF XIII? I have completed FF XIII and Im one of those people for whom the combat and graphics and music was enough to carry the experience. I liked it. So I tried to move on to XIII and I was really confused by a lot of things.I dont need to know minmaxing pro tips or  guides just some basic systems knowledge. My questions include.  So now I need to spend resources to unlock new chrystarium spots and what I spend where alters my growth. I have zero clue how this system works. What is best used where? Does it matter? Do I need to worry about messing my characters up permanently?.  Party member  is now a monster I capture and train. There are like a million potential monster buddies. Is it better to pick a few and level them the whole game or is it better to keep grabbing new ones?  Do you have any tips for that side of the game? I feel confused and paralyzed..  Both leveling up humans and creatures requires items now. I guess theres some grinding for loot drops in this game? Is there a way to find out where the item I need drops? How much grinding is normal? FF XIII put a hard cap on that stuff.Those are just some general questions. You dont need to answer all of them. Feel free to answer any number of these and please also drop any extra wisdom you think I should know. I really want to like this game and I just need a little help getting over the hump and figuring out what the basic gameplay loop is supposed to look like.Thank You!,FinalFantasy,d2xafmq,1,t5_2qhdi

Cactaur is gotten on cactaur island theres a little cactus guy that pops up and disappears on the world map if you run into him you fight jumbo cactaur and beat him to get the GF. Hes pretty easy as long as you have a high Vit stat. Bahamut and Eden are in the deep sea research center located at the very bottom left corner of the map. Getting to them is a bit more in depth than I want to go into here so just look up a guide but Bahamut is pretty simple and when you beat him you get the GF and the card which refines into  megalixirs which is stupid broken. Eden is a bit more complex and may be easier to just draw him from Tiamat in Ultimecias castle unless you just really want to fight Ultima Weapon. Doomtrain can be difficult or easy to get depending on if you can beat Malboros easily. Tonberry is a pain in the ass to get to but could possibly be worth it since you can easily draw  full lifes for everyone from him. Pandemona is normally drawn from Fujin in either of the two fights against them since you missed him you can draw him from Red Giant in Ultimecias castle. ,FinalFantasy,d3alkc4,2,t5_2qhdi

7972955,0,t1_d4c7ndu,gt For FF? The records I usually see from real speedrunners the ones who put me to absolute shame are usually right under  hours sometimes a little over.Those  hour runs normally involve using the Yuffie Save Warp glitch.You can skip over HUGE swaths of the game by using rigged save files and Yuffie encounters.Those are the runs that you see on AGDQ and stuff. I have never thought that counted though.gt Have you tried?Nogt  I see you post a lot here and you seem to have a wide knowledge about many of the games particularly .Awe. Thanks! gt Im willing to bet that if you sit down and try a casual speedrun youll have no trouble doing it in under  hours.. Tough but doable with normal gameplay and making good use of Enemy Skill.HmmmmmmI suppose maxing out the Battle Speed would help immensely. Also blank the chat.If you stop and grab Beta from the Zolom before the mines You  shot every boss through Gaias Cliff. That could be a time sink though since it is somewhat luck based. Maybe one solid attempt and then move on.Otherwise You are going to be focusing purely on Barret Yuffie Cloud.Barret you have unaltered access through the entire game Strong limit breaks good damage and can sit in the back.Yuffie is the same argument but her Level  Limit break heals for  life.

8076468,0,t3_4ps9t9,Its serious fun to be overpowered as hell and it ties in well with the other systems of the game.Crafting is everywhere nowadays but FF was one of the first games where you could farm items and craft them into magic which would make you stronger ie farming Energy Crystals from the Elnoyle in Esthar and killing Fastitocholons for Water Stones at the very start. As well as farming through killing shit you could also play cards another excellent system for the items that you need. Most of the negativity surrounding the game is due to how easily you can become overpowered which I kinda liked. Either that or using magic lowers your stats which is negligable if you rarely use magic.I played physicallimits and magic was crafted solely for junctioning except stuff like Meltdown and Regen. The battle system was amazing with fast ATB bars and player interaction. Once you junction magic to speed there is barely any boringness and you are on an all out attack throughout most trash battles with bosses giving you a bit of a hard time. Compare that to FFIX where every battle takes fucking ages and just serves to slow the game down.The GF ability system made all of this possible. Farming enemies for AP gets you the ability to craft different magic and increase your stats. It was fun to see your attack damage go up with Str at some of the major damage breakpoints in the game.,FinalFantasy,d4nvcpw,3,t5_2qhdi

The first time I played Tactics on PS I blew through the first part of the game without actually properly building my characters and got cockblocked at the VeliusBelias fight. Couldnt get past it nor was I willing to restart my game and I was young and stupid enough to have only one save file so one day I went out with my mom to buy some  Christmas gifts I found a GameShark CDX in a music and videogames store clearance. Asked her to give me some of my savings and bought it right away. Blitzed through the rest of the game with it.Years later I bought War of the Lions on Android and Ive been routinely breaking it with my deeper and betterunderstood knowledge of the game mechanics.

The fact that you have to have everyone levelled up because of their own specialisations and enemy weaknesses is soooooo much more interesting to me than just sticking with the same  characters for the majority. That said I know I am one of those players that grindcomplete pretty obsessively in FFVII I had stupid amounts of master materia by the time Id finished. Give enough distinction yet enough drive to completion and thats why the Sphere Grid really WORKS for me. Contrast XII which I liked but the combat system and homogeneity of levelling up so much quicker than X felt like you ended up with many nondefined characters gameplay wise.

The InternationalHD version also added the Dark Aeons and Penance superboss another extra challenge to overcome once youve reached the end of the game.There really isnt any way to defend XIIIs linearity however.

You literally said it doesnt matter how insane a final boss is if he can be killed by the player character then no distinction can be made between the power of antagonists. If they were defeatable then everything is on the same playing field. gtIt doesnt matter if Bhunivelze created anything if he ultimately can be defeated by a mortal being.Right there you said it. Even if I was slightly wrong about his god like status he still towers over any other FF antagonist in terms of power and ability and as a result nothing changes in my argument. He can create worlds and other gods. There is no enemy in FF that can rival Bhunivelze and as a result that easily makes Lightning the most badass character.

The battle system near the end of the game is legitimately fun once the kid gloves are off and you have full access to the job classes and a three person party. The problem is that it is a battle system that really only has any strategic depth until you have a three member party and you dont actually get full access to a three person party until youre almost halfway through the game. A big missed opportunity. Id also love to see how deep the strategy could get with a  person party in the XIII system especially with the ability to switch between lead character on the fly and removing the lead character gets KOed and you lose rule. They also needed to ditch the Achillesheel approach to most boss battles where beating most bosses is a matter of figuring out the weakness for that boss and then starting the battle over with the right paradigm setup to steamroll it.,FinalFantasy,d5yi35b,1,t5_2qhdi

8517626,0,t3_4w66gw,I like the easy swapability in X and the level of strategization that the conditional turn based gives you is appropriate for me It actually made me more strategic than in the other games where I just made my characters overpowered and mashed axo every battle and boss battle evenXs specialization systems were neat but it still led to the button mashing problem which would then lead to long periods of standing around and doing nothing during the battle which seemed longer then normal atb after jumping all over the screen earlier in the fight. But that may just be because I refuse to engage emotionally with that game in any formIX is super slow any ATB game with summons was just throw the summons until you win FFXs CTB made it a little harder to do this sometimes like the jecht fight and any of the preatb games are unstable and sometimes manipulable.

But in this case the player is clearly telling the game that they do not want an increased challenge.  They are doing something that they know will make the game easier.

The combat however is possibly the most challenging Ive experienced in any FF game and the way you explore in MQ is easily better than any of the d numbered entries.Dirge of Cerberus is pretty bad in all aspects.  The gameplay is awful but the story is even worse.  For some reason though I can play this crap for hours.  Something about how mindless the action is keeps me hooked.FFX is probably the most embarrassing game Ive ever owned.  I hate the characters story and the way the game works.  The combat on the other hand is so much fun.   This is easily the best iteration of atb period.

8857860,0,t3_50uw2s,To weigh in my thoughts on the movieIt felt like it got edited down from its full length to fit under two hours for theatrical release. I seriously think this movie wouldve been far more enjoyable and less jarring if they had the directors original cut. Look at Advent Children Complete. The added  minutes fixed most of the narratives confusing plot points pacing and made the film feel...complete.Kingsglaive felt rushed jumpy and unfocused. There were times that anyone with a filmmaking background could tell something had been removed between shots. My boyfriend who is not nearly as analytical with films felt it was all over the place pretty early on. Particularly with the fade to blacks as well as the death of a certain character. The pacing of the movie just felt off.Ill reserve my complete judgment of the film until I see a Directors Cut. As it stands now Kingsglaive in its current form is a rushed jumpy mess and I am hard pressed to recommend it to anyone. Which is a very painful thing to admit of a universe Ive been excited for since .,FinalFantasy,d7cl8jx,1,t5_2qhdi

8902378,0,t3_527cz8,While researching the game I found that magic is not specific the Lucian line of Kingsthe last line of Royalty on Eos. Apparently ordinary people can gain the use of magic after being brought to the very edge of dying.I personally subscribe to the theory that Noctis gained the Magic sometime around the  years prior to the events of the moviethe trip to Tenebrae when Noctis was being pushed around in a wheelchair. Caveat Lunafreya getting the Ring of the Lucii to Noctis is not so that he can acquire the Old Wall but so that Noctis may commune with the Lucian Kings of old and seek their advice. EditIn the world of XV there exist people gifted with magical abilities either through a nations crystal or through other means such as neardeath experiences. This from the FFxv Wikipedia page. Given that the Lucian line no longer possess a crystal I can only assume that it is the latter.,FinalFantasy,d7hxrq6,8,t5_2qhdi

If he truly cared about seeing the outfit as he mentioned numerous times all he had to do was look at the very photo he claimed showed none of it. Of course he doesnt actually care what the photo shows other than tits. Which is pretty funny because the only thing Tifa is remembered for is her tits. Because she was a sexualized character after all. Apparently uGirthquake has a problem with cosplayers being sexual when cosplaying as sexuailized characters.

8968122,0,t3_52muzk,Well XII is not my favorite but it is certainly up there so I will toss in my two cents.  A preface I am talking about the IZJS version so this is comparable to the Zodiac Age its just massively better than the NA release.  The first thing I like about XII is the worldbuilding.  Pretty much every previous Final Fantasy X aside have created complete worlds and given the player the ability to traverse them completely by the end of the game.  But so much of those worlds are empty barren places where mountains exist as barriers to block character progression rather than places to visit.  You only get a part of a continent in XII but it feels like a full world the fact that each area needs to be crossed on foot at least once before you can teleportfly there helps.  Each area is also alive with enemies wandering around rather than being cut in random battles.  Almost every area has secrets to discover and chests to loot.  Heres were a difference in IJZS shines in vanilla XII chests were absolute garbage and there was almost no reason to even bother opening them.  In IJZS and presumably the Zodiac Age chests contain spellstechs and relevant items that dont require the diamond armlet to get.  Opening chests now feels rewarding and going out of the way to find a chest is actually worth it.This ties into the second thing I like about it nonlinearity.  The story like the story of every FF is linear.  Broken bridges will stop you from going anywhere plot significant before you are supposed to but so much of the world is available far before you need to go there.  I enjoy raiding areas far above my level and finding gear that Id be able to buy when traveling through there multiple dungeons before I should have them.  The ability to get things like the burning bow before the sewers or go fight Zalera right after Raithwall.  The amount of challenge and payoff you can get in this game far outweighs the rest of the series.  Forget disk one nukes you can pick up the infinity plus one sword made for the post game before you are two thirds through the plot.Finally I really like the gameplay.  XII has some of the best gameplay in the series not only is it fast paced and varied but also extremely challenging.  Compare to say X a universally liked and lauded game.  In X enemies and bosses are rather static in their abilities and strategies.  Yunalesca is lauded and hated for being one of the only bosses in the game to react to your actions and to change strategies midway though the fight.  Every single boss and mark and XII does that.  From dropping magic and switching to nothing but physical attacks when at low hp to buffing and healing themselves to punishing you for daring to debuff them.  Every fight is difficult and fun and I salute you greatly if you managed to automate everything to the degree that you didnt need to do anything against a boss.  I needed to constantly position my characters manually remove debuffs react to a change in the enemy gambit setup change equipment to block an incoming debuff and so on.,FinalFantasy,d7ptzim,1,t5_2qhdi

I just want a good Final Fantasy game no matter if its a big or lowbudget or awesome graphics games like Bravely Default proves that theres still hope and that I think art styles is more important then graphics.FFXV feels like yet again SquareEnix tries to rather innovative the genre then making a good final fantasy.

9029712,0,t1_d7wp63p,I hate to do a wall of text response so sorry! But theres quite a lot to respond to here.To start with I want to clarify I didnt insult peoples intelligence for liking the scene. I insulted peoples intelligence for not understanding why people didnt like the scene. I appreciate I went too far by calling people stupid but you can see why I felt people werent applying their intellect if all they could come up with to attack people who dont like the scene was they dont understand it especially as its not a difficult scene to understand!Now I can see that you feel Im dodging arguments and making others as I please. But really Ive only ever made two core pointsThe scene is bad but this is an opinionA lot of you are misunderstanding why people dislike the scene and this is a fact but not said in a nice way.Now can you see from the above why Im willing to enter an argument over the second point and not the first? Hint its the last four words of each point.You say that when I post in a public forum I am open to scrutiny. Well that may be but I am equally within my right to a refuse to enter into an argument and b point out how fruitless it is to argue over an opinion.Now if anyone wanted to argue with me over point  that would be fine!

I can see why the music would be annoying for those used to the ps version totally get that. But really its the same soundtrack played through two different midi chips.

The other one that grew on me was The Wavering BladeFinal Fantasy  has so many great tracks I have a hard time deciding to where to begin. I really like all of the battle themes and think Nascent Requiem is a very good final boss theme. No one ever seems to talk about the theme from the Yaschas Massif which is very catchy and one of my favorite tracks on the OST. Just about all of the background music for the main areas of the game The Vestige Lake Bresha The Vile Peaks to name the first few are very good as well and I dont know that I see those first  mentioned too often. Finally Ill throw out Atonement as one final track from this one.I am a HUGE fan of Lightning Returns soundtrack especially some of the more downtempo music. The Sleeping City Sunset Prism Midnight Eternal Sunset Path Prowlers of the Night Ouroboros Festival Nova Chrysalia and Altar of Light are all really good. I also like Desert Lullaby both with the vocals and the version without vocals The battle themes are all very good too although I think they are probably more wellknown and wellliked.,FinalFantasy,d8b5c8s,3,t5_2qhdi

Im more patient and openminded but could also be described as easier to please.This topic also spills into other things like how people enjoy stories from shows or books or graphic novelsmanga etc as well.

After the .. patch the iOS version polished the graphics up and made the game look brilliant while retaining the original feel. You can also skip cutscenes and not just the prerendered ones but the ones youve seen a hundred times already if youve played the game a lot. It also doesnt have the slowdown or the audio issues from the PSP version.

My only dislike is that Magick is so useless aside from Cure and Reflect on some fights. But Magick is so underwhelming and the swords are too strong. I played the vanilla version. Wish I played the Intl Zodiac Job system instead but it wasnt out yet when I started the game. I was sad after I  the game. That was after the hour straight Yiazmat fight. There was nothing left to do. That sad feeling when I closed the game knowing I wont boot it anymore. I played Revenant Wings just to quench that FF thirst after though. ,FinalFantasy,d8z52xl,1,t5_2qhdi

Yevon has nothing to do with the church beside the name after creating Sin he became part of the monster long before the church. Yunalesca created the summonerpilgrimage ritual to deal with Sin as it kept ravaging everything. The church was corrupt in the use of its power but it wasnt wrong it was merely a tool to deal with Sin.Sin and Spiras regression happened because of the Machine War eventually leading to Sins creation as a desperate measure not some religious ideology.

9535934,0,t1_d9oa56c,Thanks a lot for the detailed response. Reading that and some other threads helped me understand the story much better. So to recapArecia and Gala are working together to find Etros gate and the only purpose of Orience is to make class zero really powerful so they can find it as well as unleashing the Rursus to slaughter everyone which could also find it. Over time Arecia realized how immoral and inefficient this is and gives up on it and I guess Gala does too either because he agrees with her or because he cant do the Orience spiral thing on his own. Did I get that right?Some minor things I still dont get regarding Machina and Rem. When they fought each other they didnt seem to recognize each other. Machina was wearing a costume but Rem was wearing her normal clothes so why did he not recognize her and kill her? He only was sad and shocked after he stabbed her. Do lCie simply have no control over their own actions and were they forced to fight each other?Also why were they still able to help class zero after they were frozen? The other lCie didnt seem to do anything when they were dead.And who are Tiz and Joker and why did he call Machina his other self?Oh and one more thing after the assassination of the queen their COMM didnt work anymore is it ever explained why or is it up for speculation? I thought it had something to do with the consortium conspiring against class zero but after reading up on it it does not look like they were involved in the assassination.,FinalFantasy,d9oi42k,2,t5_2qhdi

IF I CANT HAVE A LITTLE FUN IN THIS WORLD THEN WHAT IN THE HELL IS THE POINT OF EVEN BEING HERE?!?!?! Hopes....dreams...none of that will matter once youre dead!! why create...when it will only be destroyed? why value life when you are destined to die? in the end...nothing really matters. better to enjoy it as opposed to getting recruited into some crazy cult of nutjobs who believe in something like a bunch of maroons!!!now destruction! THATS something worth fighting for!! you destroy something and BAM! its gone!! law getting in your way? kill the cops!! theyre the only law enforcement around who cares if they were nice people? they were in the way. exwife getting on your nerves? kill her thatll shut her up quick!! taxes got you down? BLOW UP THE IRS!!! thatll teach em!! any of your problems can be resolved with a healthy dose of destruction!!!except for crippling depression.....not even....destroying yourself....helps with that......blows nose on a pink hankerchiefMy point is nothing matters in a world where everything you cherish everything you value everything you CLING TO can be destroyed at the drop of a hat a meteorite could literally fall on us and blow up society and wed be back at square one. your entire financial career all that financial security it could ALL go down the drain because some asshole decided he wanted to frame you for something and in a passive society everybody believes the aggressor.no nothing you do will matter have a family legacy? one black sheepll ruin that like nobodys business. Have a dream? good for you heres homelessness in a broken economy now your dreams will NEVER be realized!!! have a job? oops looks like somebody robbed the store on YOUR shift and your boss just HAD to blame somebody other than the thief so youve been fired and with a permanent black stain on your record! gosh.I relate to kefka because he realizes the pointlessness of living in an impermanent world and decides to do the only sane thing and hasten the impermanence to its fullest conclusion. he also dresses up like a clown so theres that.so when you go out that door to go off to work today remember that somehow somewhere some force is plotting your demise. someTHING will ruin that day youre having and your entire world will collapse around you and if it doesnt then youre luckier than you realize.EDIT most of this post was sarcasm but my point was not.,FinalFantasy,da4ggys,2,t5_2qhdi
9673007,0,t3_5dl2rd,Ive played XI for about  years. Had a lot of fond memories and a lot of not so fond ones. Where people I thought were my friends just flat out ignored me when I asked if I could tag along to contents that I needed to clear. It was due to this that I realised I really hate social games and having to depend on others for help. I mained Beastmaster towards the end pre  cap and solod all the way. Also solod all jobs to . It was due to having to depend on other people to clear high end content and that it took too much time that I eventually quit. Loner in real life loner in mmo. Figures lol. But in saying that though one very awesome moment was when I wanted to finish up the last Bastok mission . As usually cant find anyone to help  stupid game so tried soloing it as blm lol. Tried a couple of times and failed. So I shouted for a team and one rdm responded. So we decided to duo it. This was  cap so was challenging. We died about  times and he said he had to go soon. So we tried it one more time. Despite him not listen to me to not cast Aero iii double ice weather in Xacarbard  we ended up winning as a duo and we were both very happy. ,FinalFantasy,da5eg3a,3,t5_2qhdi

Aesthetically Ive always loved the grimy notquite steampunk  worlds fused with high fantasy and would love to see more worlds take advantage of that.I can only hope that the Chancellor in XV is even close to Kefka as a villain as he seems to have a very similar character archetype. Sephiroth was a great baddie in his own right and I loved the depth of the FFVII story with some great twists and turns .Ill never be able to chose a favorite between the two though  is much easier to go back to for playthroughs as  hasnt aged well visually.

9725927,0,t1_dabgx0i,I wouldnt really compare the draw system to that of VIII other than the super basics of it since you draw from areas of the maps and just need to draw the three main elements Fire Ice Thunder not every spell type in the game.

9756043,0,t1_daflu33,FFXIII trilogy takes it wayyy over the top in terms of protag power levelsabilities not in terms of being easy that title goes to FF. Any of the LCie from XIII and especially Lightning from Lightning returns would easily get my nomination as strongest characters in the FF series both in terms of feats and stats. Snow could easily solo every other pugilist in the series by end game and I dont even particularly like Snow over others like Zell who would still easily take nd place pugilist because of his limit break alone. For perspective the final story boss of Lightning Returns has m hp is practically completely immune to damage until you stagger him and can still easily kill you even if you have configurations for  magic and physical damage resistance. And thats a technically a storyline boss. Theres absolutely no doubt in my mind that that boss is THE hardest storyline boss of any final fantasy and much harder than some of the optional legends such as Ozma Emerald Weapon Penance etc. So yes you do end up OP as hell by the end of any of the FFXIIIs shredding most of the late game enemies with your near limit break levels of basic moves.

9814455,0,t1_damsaub,gtThe reason they worked back then was because it was the best thing going. And the visuals were so good that it didnt matter if it was slow. But now that we have action games and RPGs that all move fairly quickly having your characters sit back and attack in turn would seem a little silly. I also think your mindset is frozen in a rosetinted goggles mentality. Its possible to enjoy games for what they offered back then even when compared to todays standards. Ive played IX and XII a ton of times and even what I consider worse games FF X have been a game I could replay while still enjoying it.gtThey do. Theyre called Bravely Default and Bravely Second.

9832058,0,t1_dap3oil,Does this play more like an Elder Scrolls or a Fallout game? Or given the open world design and map layout GTA even? I heard the story is lacking but if its lacking but robust in terms of exploration and things you can do thats all fine. Basically does it take influence from Elder Scrolls? Could I play it more like a TES game than an FF game and is there enough content and side quests that are interesting enough to keep going? The game has gotten lower reviews than I expected so Im trying to find out what to expect from this game. Most reviewers seem to chide it for being a departure from what FF traditionally is. If that means its more like a Bethesda game then Im all in on it. FF bored me to tears due to how linear it was and how much it lacked exploration and choice. ,FinalFantasy,dap505p,1,t5_2qhdi

9833962,0,t1_dap308g,Mmm I cant agree. While this game fails to impress graphically like each of its predecessors since VII I dont thinks its as bad as a last gen game. They actually looks spectacular given the size of the map and the huge LOD distance for everything well as rendering  characters in a single battle plus more particle effects than you can shake a stick at the textures in all seem to max out at k at best. I think what they did with this game is amazing as far as visuals from a technical standpoint but it lacks the detailed wow factor others from the series have had from the past. Side by side with XIII is have a hard time telling which came later but the sheer scale of the game in every aspect dwarfs all other games right now.,FinalFantasy,dapdykf,2,t5_2qhdi

9851482,0,t3_5gbr94,I like a good story and I like a good lore in a RPG and FFXV got none of it even the narrative and dialogues does not feel professionally written. Every Final Fantasy Ive played got a unique Interesting and sometimes unforgettable story I even loved XIII story and fantastic lore with all the flaws but this new one is not up to final fantasy standards and a lot of people is giving it a free  pass just because it got some open world and some flashy mechanics. ,FinalFantasy,daro5rs,-2,t5_2qhdi
9851806,1,t1_daroxxa,Well if someone says FFXV is good but only played  or  games from the franchise I wouldnt really count his opinion.

9852133,0,t1_darhdcr,I dont personally. I think they need the more linear world design in order to effectively tell the stories that we know theyre able to write. Even if suddenly XVs sidequests were good the narrative would still be really badly told and I think its all due to the nature of being open world.,FinalFantasy,darr7jq,1,t5_2qhdi
9852831,0,t1_daqtn88,The first  mins or so of the movie should have been the opening cinematic of the game.

9868928,0,t3_5gompg,FFXIV is the best in the franchise showing homage to the series as a whole amp being a pure FF game in an unconventional sense. What I mean by this is that while the game is massively multiplayer amp doesnt have turn based battles the story world and battle classes are all pure old school FF. Black mages blow enemies up with Flare and meteors White mages heal amp cast Holy Paladins use their sword amp shield to protect the party amp Dragoons masterfully wield lances and jump.not to mention the super badass twisting dragon shaped aura in Blood of the Dragon Sokens music rivals Uematsu in creativity amp gravitas if not quality. Admittedly ARR story is rather bland imo but the overarching lore is quite good amp you collect crystals like old school FF. While ARR story amp its st few patches leave much to be desired the story for its patches leading up to Heavensward the expansion itself amp the story concluding the Dragonsong war is easily my favorite FF story arc.AND MOTHERFUCKER DONT GET ME STARTED ON THE ALLUSION HOMAGES amp JUST THE AMOUNT OF RESPECT XIV HAS FOR THE GAMES THAT CAME BEFORE IT amp PAVED THE WAY! Theirs literally at least  bad ass allusion to each FF game.FINAL FANTASY The Garlean empire an ever present looming antagonist is named for the st games Villian Garland!FINAL FANTASY II the protagonist of the nd game Firion has his outfit as a veterans reward amp chocobo barding! The Scions of the th dawn also use the same Wild Rose password to identify members of their order.FINAL FANTASY III All or ARR  man raids are based off the dungeons amp Final stretch of the rd games crystal tower amp World of Darkness!FINAL FANTASY IV The th game sees Kains armor used as relic gear for Dragoons. The Antitower dungeons final boss has calcabrina amp her theme music lifted right out of FFIV!FINAL FANTASY V ITS MORPHIN TIME! The most notable NPC of the th game has a hilarious cameo amp Gilgamesh even gets his own trial fight!FINAL FANTASY VI The th game sees so many AMAZING allusions! A super fun fight against Typhon amp Ultros Magitech armor that plays Terras theme amp even THE WARRING TRIAD AS POWERFUL TRIAL BOSS FIGHTS!FINAL FANTASY VII The Gold Saucer is a grand amusement park with tons of fun mini games That live up to the th games original location. A revamped materia system allows for you to customise your armors stats!FINAL FANTASY VIII TRIPLEFUCKINGTRIAD can be played with all of your friends and NPCs around the world! It is just as fun amp rage inducing as the card game in the th game.FINAL FANTASY IX MOTHER FUCKING OZMA IS A RAID BOSS amp while he isnt nearly as difficult as he is in the th game he is the most difficult  man boss to date amp It can be quite the challenge to get you amp  other randoms to coordinate to defeat him. Some other neat allusions are winged Alexander amp Ark show up as raid bosses to!FINAL FANTASY X While Shivas design is wholly original her ultimate Diamond Dust takes after her incarnation from the th game freezing you amp your party to the bone with the snap of her fingers!Its also the start of some really kick ass JPunk!FINAL FANTASY XI The th title sees a few of its denizens magically teleported to Eorzea for fun seasonal events.FINAL FANTASY XII The generals lieutenants amp other big wigs of the Garlean army have armor inspired from the Judges of the th games invading empire.FINAL FANTASY XIIILightning also gets her time to shine having a FATE based questline where Etro brings the main Heroine of the th title to Eorzea! These FATEs allowed you to earn weapons amp gear based off of FFXIII.So please give FFXIV a try!

If I pause the game for too long the console shuts down automatically due to power saving settings.

9901080,0,t3_5h76ij,Why was the terrible flat and underwhelming? Was it just an oddity?Youd think from the land of Kabuki Theatres wed have a Japanese company that would understand their theatrical history in order to make a competent story. But they doSome interesting things to considergt ...kabuki focuses more on the actors.gt ...kabuki is known to sacrifice drama and even the plot to highlight an actors talents.gt The concept of johaky ...states that dramatic pacing should start slow speed up and end quickly. gtThe first corresponds to jo an auspicious and slow opening which introduces the audience to the characters and the plot. The next three acts correspond to ha speeding events up culminating almost always in a great moment of drama or tragedy in the third act and possibly a battle in the second andor fourth acts. The final act corresponding to kyu is almost always short providing a quick and satisfying conclusion.This might help us explain Final Fantasy XVs odd structural story telling. To them us Westerners just wouldnt understand the storys kabuki structure. But even so kabuki theatres all about SHOWING you whats happening more than telling you. How does a kabuki show to its audience? Through the actors. This means a stronger interaction between main characters and NPCs would be needed flesh out the story. Why not give Cor Cindy Jared and Iris more of an in game backstory that had relevance to the main characters? Why not show more of Luna in order to feel what she means to Noctis? Why doesnt Noctis talk about her more to remind us shes his love? Why dont NPCs emote their plight with the Empire? Why arent we shown more of the inner workings of Empire the Emperor Aldercapt Ravus Ardyn etc through their actions? Why not have a sidequest where Prompto tries to impress Cindy? Why not alone time with Gladio and Iris to express how they care for each other? Why werent we shown Talcott and Jareds relationship and then shown Jareds death to feel the impact?spoiler Make sure NPC are more than just set pieces. Make us care for not just about them. Give them interactions that would be consistent within the story and let us know more about them as people. This would further force the developers to interrogate the story pinpoint why are things happen at certain moments in the plot so that character interactionmotivations stay coherent and believable throughout the game. I hear Final Fantasy XV didnt do this which made for a terrible flat and underwhelming storytelling. I believe this is something for them to learn moving forward with Final Fantasy XVI. ,FinalFantasy,day4tne,1,t5_2qhdi

9955737,0,t1_db576cf,gt Theres no way she wasnt mentally prepared for this.Just look at her counterpart... Noctis who was known since birth that he would be succeeding to his father that he would have to fight that he would have to repel the nilfheim invasion etc.... He knew what was coming despite the bits about being the true king which come only way later. Remember how immature he still was at the beginning of the game ? He had his doubts and worries about all of this which caused him to get yelled at by Gladio several times up until the Titan fight because he refused to fill in the shoes and assume his fate.The problem is that Luna has also a common development behind the scenes that is still barely shown in the chapters with Ravus flashbacks where you see her breaking down hesitating and being unsure of it all where she even had to get pushed by Ravus. So she definitely had something behind her character similarly to Noctis they just never delivered on that while still showcasing its existence.gt Her arc as a character is nonexistent and thats because shes not part of the games singular thematic focus. Oh but I definitely agree that prechapter  her development is nonexistent I personally considered her solely as a delivery girl meant only to be used in the plot but easily replaceable. Hence why as a character I consider her being flawed and I would like for that to be fixed especially since shes been sold since day  as a major character within the game. However chapter  showed us that Luna is more than what she was pictured as in the first few chapters which is imo more interesting than a walking robot.A huge attraction for me in RPGs are the characters their development and whyhow theyre doing what theyre doing Luna as a character fails to deliver that.gt Its a little out of context but I think you get the idea. What I think Square did was focus solely on a singular theme of their friendship and its development through hard times to the exclusion of everything else.  .. More world building and developing characters outside of the main four would have widened that focus and distracted from the themes they wanted to exploreI understand what youre saying but at the same time I disagree on it being a design choice and being incompatible. Theres barely any development for the chocobros outside of the chapter  fallout every new piece of information we have regarding them is quickly thrown away  Ignis being blind Prompto being half magitek and from Nilfheim Gladio going on a solo journey  and have been decided from the start to be included on the DLCs and theres barely any backstory mentioned between them  the most Ive seen is probably Prompto and Noctis scene on the roof of the old Lestallum hotel which was really amazing to see  so them being excluded from their own thematic seems a little bit inconsistent. The main antagonist clearly overshadowed them. Several side characters also got some development  Iris  Aranea  and didnt hinder much the narrative. I mean even the previous games in the series showed us that you can still ally character development and thematic just look at VI or at FFIX nearly all the main characters had their own arc and development yet the villains like the Queen Beatrix Kuja Garland and other side characters like the prince fratley Baqus Marcus Blank etc... were still quite developed. And the main group started as strangers but little by little grew closer together.With FFXV theres barely of that their relationship is preestablished their development is lacking. So yes they made the group of friends thematic believable and made us really feel these characters being real but personally I see it more as shallow without much depth on the long run. And I dont think such an approach should excuse the rest of the game being flat outside of them.The fact that theyre planning to add more scenes regarding side characters like Ravus etc... shows that they recognize their own flaw on the matter.,FinalFantasy,db59a4q,1,t5_2qhdi

10069404,0,t3_5jvux1,I have mixed feelings about this game. On one hand I really enjoy the gameplay find the open world aweinspiring and fun to explore and most importantly I feel that XV captures the spirit of the Final Fantasies I grew up with. It really feels kindred to VIII in my opinion and I love that.On the other hand the story is a catastrophe. Up until chapter  I thought it was fine. A little shallow and occasionally unclear but fine. But from chapter  on it goes completely off the rails and winds up destroying much of what was interesting about the story in the first place. I dont want to spoil anything but by the end I think the story turned out to be one of the worst and worsttold of any FF. Maybe XIII was worse. Maybe.So its hard to know what to think about this game. Ive really enjoyed playing it Im enjoying the postgame content and Im excited that it seems to provide a workable blueprint for the Final Fantasy series as a whole.

If you could wait but most a lot of the good features of the other teamsters of FF are turbo modes and no encounters but for FF  I dont think they are needed DEdit zodiac age if its the one that introduces the zodiac jobs I would skip it Bc it does constrain your party choices such as you cant have all Knights but it does introduce an arena where you fight against bosses and such. In addition its easier to acquire some of the best weapons than in the original version Zodiac spear is quite easy to miss however despite the arena the original is better in my eyes because the optional bosses are pretty dam challenging I have yet to beat a few.

10162066,0,t3_5le66w,Ok. Think I have the perfect setup here so Ill post this just in case anyone wants to use it. Itll likely run a bit long but everything fits incredibly well. I offered an explanation on each as well. Also spreads them out evenly and keeps conflicting GFs apart.Quezacotl Squall  Due to the Card mod Squalls name and it being the first GF you acquire.Shiva Quistis  Matches her facial appearance with the pigtails found in her classroom makes sense considering shes youre instructor and wants to help you on your Seed Exam.Ifrit Zell  Fits in with his fire motif and the fact he likes guns due to the ammo refine ability. Also the fact hes the only male leading character that doesnt use something gun related as a weapon.Siren Rinoa  Works with her angel wing motif the fact her mother was a singer and due to the refine abilities it grants you general items as well as life and death magic. Fitting for a sorceress.Brothers Irvine  Fits since the motto of Galbadia is Keep on rockin and other Galbadian SeeDs originally tried to conquer the dungeon and failed. Hes also the only person who remembers his brothers from the orphanage. Diablos Squall  Mainly due to the time related magic. This matches well with fact Squall travels though time to warn Edea and Cid gives him the lamp. You can also have Laguna use the lamp instead and it works as a plot heirloom. Laguna gave it to Edea who gave it to Cid who gave it to Squall.Carbuncle Selphie  Its power is Ruby Light which matches with Selphies birthstone. She also loves cute things and it lets you refine recovery items which fits with her white mage role. Finally its a GF without an attack which fits with the only other one you junction to Irvine.Levithan Quistis  This matches with her other GF Shiva and nets you support and GF recovery magicitems which makes sense for Quistiss protective big sis nature. Also fits cause you find it at Balamb so for plot sake Id bring Quistis during disk  to fight NORG.Pandemona Zell  The GF is found in Balamb Town which is where hes from and his family lives. Also is some slight poetic vindication for him since Seifer and his goonies bully Zell so it makes sense he gets to steal their GF.Cerberus Irvine  Fits well since its Galbadia Gardens Guardian say that x fast matches well with his other GF since both are from Greek mythology and is the only other nonattacking GF which matches with his crush Selphie.Alexander Rinoa  Allows you to empower healing items and magic which fits with her sorceress role. Alexander also uses holy magic and sometimes has wings in other FF games which again fits well with Rinoa.Doomtrain Selphie  Shes a train nut. Doomtrains refine abilities can also boost stats and grants elixirs which fits well with Selphies white mage role.Bahamut Squall  Usually the most badassking GF in each game. Fitting that it would go to Squall. The way to get him is to also fight past Ruby Dragons which matches what Laguna had to do as a Sorceress Knight in his movie role. Its also the closest related GF to Griever.Cactur Irvine  Fits in with Irvines old west cowboy look and speed. His attack also shoots needles at you which is fitting considering Irvine uses a shotgun. Also mirrors the next matchup a little.Tonberry Selphie  Her classmate mentions it mirrors Irvines GF above and it also fits in well with Selphies first GF she forgot the name of may even well be it. You know she took a trip to Centra at some point and defeated a monster to get her GF which is exactly how you get Tonberry.Eden Squall  Should be selfexplanatory. Most powerful GF in the game Squall also created all the gardens and is the leader of Balamb. Finally its refine ability allows you to teach abilities to every other GF.,FinalFantasy,dbvxd8n,2,t5_2qhdi

10188810,1,t3_5lv5ln,Honestly the fact that Square Enix wants Final Fantasy to be a Western RPG is what I think the biggest problem is. Instead of working with what you have they want to be something they arent. They are taking elements of different Western style games and forcing it into Final Fantasy because they are afraid to lose money.It started with X but it was fine. It continued with XII but it was fine. After XII things went down hill and Final Fantasy just hasnt been Final Fantasy.,FinalFantasy,dbyyi5q,2,t5_2qhdi

Thats pretty current in the gaming industry to learn from their mistakes in a game and change them with its successor.The open world and absence of datalogs mostly stemmed from the critics FFXIII received back in the days and it also brought new issues with them so XIII is still in a way responsible for some issues although they were all ultimately provoked by the executives and the ones in charge.,FinalFantasy,dbzdv8j,7,t5_2qhdi

10218144,0,t3_5m4ldy,I spent this whole section of the game looking at the rooms and corridors and thinking about how they resembled parts of the Shinra HQ or Vector. I got caught up with the idea of actually seeing those places in this newer and darker perspective and imagining this could be some of the groundwork for the FF remake so I was content to look around here. Also there is a really awesome cityscape just outside before you go in then you realize that this city and the giant facility itself is totally devoid of living people. A giant ghost city consumed by demons! I thought that was amazing. An entire nation of soldiers and innocent civilians living there deceived trapped and turned into monsters and the radio reports of the emergency situation spreading back home. At this point the game had become much darker than I had ever anticipated and the reality of the apocalypse had begun to sink in.The length of this dungeon really allowed me the time to dwell on all of these things and also on Ardyn his taunts his goal and why does he hate me so much!? I still wasnt too sure what his endgame was here. So thats why I enjoyed it personally it gave me time to think while I could soak up the atmosphere.My brother said it was shit though and I absolutely understand why.

10312414,0,t1_dccw6ph,Every enemy type drops a type of sphere. You can look up which ones drop what but most drop ones that suit their ability. So coyotes are speed flans are magic and so on. You might want to hold off on certain spheres like ability since there are some very good abilities you dont want to miss but once you get to the Miihen Highroad you can farm dual horn for them. For the most part its in your best interest to use any grid sphere you come across youre highly unluckily to run out of stat spheres. Its only ability spheres that can get rare. You can also buy items that increase the drop rate if youre running low but thats an HD only addition. I think theyre called Distillers. They wont make that sphere drop from any enemy they just make them drop more of that sphere so an ability sphere on a coyote is a waste since they only drop speed. But you can research all of that without spoilers. ,FinalFantasy,dccyvbt,1,t5_2qhdi

10395011,0,t1_dcmbtow,Different tastes I guess.  Im going off memory because its been years since I touched FF but I remember finding it to be too hands off during the actual combat itself and I didnt like setting what the AIcontrolled allies would do in advance of battle.  I didnt care for the combat in FF either.I was really into the ATB system and the only Final Fantasy combat system Ive enjoyed since they abandoned it was actually FF.  Maybe its a reflection of my changing tastes but Im enjoying the more fluid actionoriented style of FF and the fact that I dont have much control over my party members other than occasionally issuing orders doesnt bother me now as much as it does.  I guess Ive gotten used to that after playing games like Mass Effect Dragon Age etc.So maybe if I went back to FF now Id view the combat more favorably but at the time it was one of the reasons I fell out of the game.  It wasnt the only though.  I wasnt engaged with the story either and I remember getting kind of lost when it came to what I was supposed to be doing.

This especially goes for Famitsu once a magazine heralded for its incredibly harsh reviewing that not only went mainstream but was caught up in a corruption scandal where a reviewer was bribed by a company to give a game a high score.

10524538,0,t3_5qplff,At first glance anyone who plays the game can develop a type of hate towards Tidus. I thought that Tidus was childish insecure cocky but he changed while the game progressed.As you said he just tags along at the beggining.  When he was playing blitzball in Dream Zanarkand and Sin appears. He just follows Auron tags and he is teleported to the ruins...meeting Rikku.  Rikku makes him work taggingalong Sin strikes back and again appears in the beach of Besaid.  Wakka takes him to Yuna and he begans to tagalong to any problem or conflict in Spira.  And so on.I think the story itself its no longer a tagalong when Seymour Guado appears and tries to take over control of Spira with Sin. I think thats the breaking point in the story and the unspected maturity of Tidus gradually of course. ,FinalFantasy,dd12jxo,6,t5_2qhdi

10535787,0,t3_5qq9y5,My major issues are the fact that it gets linear in the second half and that the story feels nonexistent.They had a second continent designed and it just needed some more work for a few months to finish it off and add content to it. But instead after that boss fight we only explore this second continent through linear ontherails levels that would make FFXIII blush in how straightforward they are. I hope and pray they at least add this second continent as DLC in future.I couldnt tell you what the story was about in all honesty. No idea what Ardyns real motives were. It sets up nicely but it quickly descends into nonsense. No idea who a lot of these characters are outside of the main four party members. Dont know why anyone does what they do in this game.

So war broke out between the two nations. The thing with Delita and Ovelia is complicated too. On the surface Delita was using his influence to give Ovelia rights to the throne but in reality Delita was also using Ovelia to become king himself. Ovelia saw through the ruse and took action seeing that Delita just uses everyone including herself and even Ramza. And Im pretty sure Delita wasnt killed just injured. He probably killed Ovelia though to truly leave him alone and with nothing but the kingdom to restore karmic balance.,FinalFantasy,dd9f6ja,2,t5_2qhdi

10634270,0,t3_5s4w5x,There are unskippable tutorials throughout the game that show you how to use it. You can also review them at any time in the menu.Basics GFs summons are equippable. The character that has one equipped inherits the ability to modify certain stats so long as the GF in question has learned that statj ability. Magic in a characters inventory can be assigned junctioned to a stat to buff it. The size buff depends on the type of magic it is and the quantity the character has in their inventory. You get a preview of the change so you can easily compare effects Magic can also be junctioned to infuse physical attacks with elements and status effects fire magic on attack deals fire damage death magic junctioned to attack has a chance to instakill etc. Magic can be junctioned to grant elemental and status resitances allowing characters to take less damage from elemental attacks and negate negative status effects. Magic can be obtained through drawing or refining. The most efficient way is to refine Triple Triad cards into items and then those items into magic. Use the GF menu to assign abilities for GFs to learn and then fight battles to earn the required AP.Actually thats not the basics. Thats literally everything you need to know. Its very simple.,FinalFantasy,ddcue56,1,t5_2qhdi

10699197,0,t1_ddjboec,I understand that in the case of the Hell Wyrm and Yiazmat but for bosses like Zodiark Omega Mk. XII and the Judge Magistrate bogging down the difficulty wouldnt achieve anything than taking away the reward of defeating such difficult foes. None of them had a terrifying amount of HP none of them had stupid defenses yet all of them were incredibly difficult in their own way. Omega is a constant barrage of attacks that will  shot any character no matter their HP. Zodiark gets more and more dangerous the lower his HP gets until he is eventually invulnerable  of the time making you time your attacks and even swap your gambits midfight for a more defensive setup Darkja is evil. And the Judge Magistrate is well... a boss unlike any other in difficulty. They work so well together and compliment their powers so damn well that it makes beating them an achievement of its own merit. If those bosses stay tough then I have absolutely no problem with the difficulty changes. If they become childs play at lvl  like many other enemies do however then I will probably find the late game much less fulfilling. ,FinalFantasy,ddjjjn4,2,t5_2qhdi

The only reason he chose Rabanastre as the location for the battle against Rozzaria is because he needed to wipe out the resistance too.  Similarly he was only plotting on murdering Larsa because others in power kept trying to make Larsa the ruler.  Had they just let him rule Larsa would have been safe.  Vaynes entire motivation was based on the greater good and he had the benefit of gaining insight from an actual god.  While Vossler didnt know Vaynes true motivations he did realize that the least bloody solution would have been to let Vayne just win.

11068586,0,t3_5xzb93,I absolutely unequivocally hated XII when I played it at launch. It didnt feel like FF to me. It felt overly politically based and the amount of similarities it seemed to have with Star Wars was ruining what I could enjoy.The gambit system felt like I wasnt doing anything myself I cared very little for the characters and those I did like werent really explored much. It was all Balthier and I never liked Han Solo to begin with so I wasnt gonna start doing so now.The whole game just felt like an empty MMO which a other games were doing too at the time so it sort of makes sense looking back anyone remember the .hack series?The skill system did little to win me over either.Considering this followed X which was is and most likely always will be my favourite of the series it was such a let down.I couldnt care less for the world of Ivalice and maybe thats partly why I dont care for the tactics games either...Ill still be getting the new version and Ill drive my way through it as much as I can.

11112019,0,t3_5ydz8v,First of you like what you like. If the story or the modern setting doesnt grab you then thats cool. Different strokes for different folks. But its interesting that you say you like XII because of how political the story was. I have often argued on this sub and others that XII is not that political at all and that VII actually has more interesting politics in it. True XII is about characters that hold political power  but you dont really see or experience the effects of shifting powers nor do you ever need to form alliances with opponents or make morally grey decisions. XII is from the very start a story of Team Good Guys versus Vayne who is the obvious antagonist from the very beginning.  You see him in some cutscenes taking more power through political maneuvering   but theyre all done far away from the player against some Senators the player was just recently introduced to and knows nothing about Compare this to Xenogears where wellestablished characters in a wellestablished heirarchy backstabbed each other with no real understanding of how much power he had before that no real impact to the Empires actions and no change to the protagonists mission. You see politics but mostly as a witness rather than participant. FFVII on the other hand has a threeway power struggle between Shinra Sephiroth and your party. At the beginning you dont even know Sephiroths intention and dont know if you should be happy or scared as he kills off Shinra members. At some point you may align with unlikely foes. You see Shinra members pushing and pursuing different policies   each with a different direction on where your party has to go and whom they need to fight. Youll see towns that are the way they are specifically because of political decisions made by both the town and Shinra. Even experience interparty politics as members of your group will push the group in different conflicting directions. But thats just my opinion. Everyones is different. ,FinalFantasy,derjdlm,1,t5_2qhdi

11130663,0,t3_5yt2vx,I mean looking at your post there are two things that stand out really. One of which is that Final Fantasy isnt popular. Final Fantasy as a general rule is still popular enough. But its not going to ever be super popular with the mainstream crowd thats just not the kind of series it is. I would say the real issue is generating new content as barring XV which has been kind of mixed in reception almost all of the stuff it makes is crossover kind of games. The other thing that I see is that the FF series changes a lot. I would say that there is a... core FFness that the games are built around. Each FF is different yet there is a commonality that most of them share. Its why when we got something like Spirits Within I would say the majority thought it wasnt very FFlike. It varies from person to person though but Id still say the majority of the FF games have that feeling only one that is considered part of the series that doesnt mesh with it is XV to me. ,FinalFantasy,detnfrj,1,t5_2qhdi

11166973,0,t1_dexor7o,gtUnfortunately unlike X the entire script of XIII isnt online in searchable format but as the top poster noted they explain what a Lcie and a Falcie and PSICOM and the Sanctum are to you like  times over in the first few. Youre inferring a lot from how  is written like square hates its audience or something lolThere is a transcript.  I put it in as source in my last comment  Thats how I have exact timing on when lcie and falcie is mentioned and when they actually explain it.  They explain about the Purge  scenes after its mentioned then Vanille does an ELI version for Hope almost right away. They dont explain lcie or falcie until they get into the Vestige end of chapter  and Sahz literally says it in his first lines.gtI guess Tarantino hates his audience for beginning most his movies in media res.Its not the in media res thats troubling.  Its the amount of coded information that cannot be inferred or easily inferred thats the problem.Reservoir Dogs for example doesnt come out exactly and tell you whats going on but from whats happening we can reasonably infer whats going on and who is who  Theyre not making up special code words theyre not answering code words with more code words.gt So mako cetra aeon eidolion pyreflie genome farplane esper and materia are common nouns you hear everyday? huh....Again Ive addressed this.  Mako reactors that power the city implies its a power source.  Pyreflies and Farplane are explained to Tidus almost as soon as he opens his mouth.  Aeons espers materia and summons are explained in combat tutorials as soon as they appear.  Theyre not explained with more unexplained jargon. gtReplaying VI I wonder why that game doesnt get more shit for not getting good until later.I would say because the story in itself was already interesting. This girl has been oppressed and persecuted by the Empire and as the underground resistance were going to help her regain her memory and set her free.  For the first part of the game you played because you want to help the girl not because the combat was interesting.  Combat was only a way to progress the story.  FFXII has Do you want to be a Sky Pirate?  Weve got bunny girls.   Yeah I didnt like that game either.gtthats right its because like X its old so its the best thing ever.I remember complaining FFXIII never had any overworld where we walked around.  But I just recently plat FFX took me  years ugh and you know what FFX had the same corridors too just that they hid it better.  gtVI is my faveMy top  is probably FFX FFVI FFI FFXIII hah!

11167928,0,t3_5zfpxm,So whatever job you level in doesnt matter your stats dont grow based on what job you were in when you gained a level. Instead each job has certain stat modifiers which when you switch into the job it changes your stats to. So imagine Black Mage has the following statsHP Str Mag Spd That means that when you switch to Black Mage it will make those changes to you base stats. Imagine your base stats are HP Str Mag Spd That means that when you switch to Black Mage your stats becomeHP Str Mag Spd Okay so simple enough right? Now lets look at what happens when you master a job. When you master a job it overwrites Freelancers base stat modifiers with any positive stat modifiers from the mastered job. So say these are Freelancers modifiersHP Str Mag Spd If that were the case and you mastered Black Mage Freelancers new stat modifiers would be as suchHP Str Mag Spd Notice that Freelancer overwrote its poor Mag modifier  with the excellent one from Black Mage. It did not take Black Mages modifier from HP or Strength since those were negative and it already had a positive one. Spd stayed the same because they each had the same modifier . Okay so now what happens when you master another job? Say you master White Mage after this. Its modifiers are as suchHP Str Mag Spd That means if you master White Mage after Black Mage your Freelancer stats will look like suchHP Str Mag Spd Notice that the Mag modifier didnt change! Thats because the Black Mage modifier was already better and so White Mages  did nothing. But notice that White Mages  in HP and Spd did overwrite the Freelancers old stats. Thats because the White Mage had the better modifier so it took priority. The upside of this is that to have perfect stats in Freelancer and Mime which functions identically you only need to master five jobs whichever jobs have the highest modifier in each stat. I think that means Monk for HP Knight for Str Summoner for Mag White Mage for Spirit ? and Thief for Speed. If everyone maxes all five of those jobs theyll have the strongest Freelancers possible. Of course you still want to master other jobs because they have some pretty sweet abilities. One last note which I didnt know for years. Some jobs have an Equip Swords or Black Magic or Equip Ribbons type ability. These look useless but theyre not. Instead if you equip the Knights Equip Swords onto your Black Mage not only will the Black Mage be able to equip Knight Swords but theyll also get all of the Knight Strength bonuses so theyll be competent with the Sword too! Magic abilities function the same way. So if you want a hybrid fighter you can give a mage an Equip Swords or a Fighter Black Magic. I still dont do this since there are better uses for those slots but these abilities are better than they at first appear. Good luck! ,FinalFantasy,dexvfoa,7,t5_2qhdi

Look up SeeD test answers to become rich early on and buy whatever you want. Buy and mod Tents into Curagas and junction to your health for a huge boost. You can do this in very beginning of game and will make you unkillable for a while because youll have health in s while enemies only do s of damage. Always keep Squall in yellow to abuse Limit Break. That will carry you for like  of the game alone.

11315728,0,t3_61hwmq,Im old so I thought cutscenes were better when they were largely playable. Sure put in that minute sequence where all the player can do is advance dialogue boxes. But if you want a minute sequence make it playable.Final Fantasy VI demonstrates this very well. The opera sequence could have been made into a movie if it had been conceived ten years later. Instead you get an interactive intro a few minutes of sitting and watching the opera regain control to remind Maria of her lines play Marias solo as a minigame go back to watching the opera and then regain control to play a timed dungeonette and fight a random but entertaining boss before the final chain of three cutscenes.

11537460,0,t3_64nu9c,Imo Blue Magic is pretty much always a soft minmaxer thing. Its okay if you just use the stuff you learn by coincidence and it can be really broken if you seek out the power skills with some guiderelated assistance but for a casual playthrough theres almost always easier options. It doesnt help that some of the best blue magic usually requires esoteric methods to learn like confusing the enemy that knows mighty guard and hoping it casts that on your blue mage.I think the fix is really in a bunch of QOL changes that never seem to materialize in FF for some reason even though they seem kind of obvious. Make it more obvious which skills are learnable make it more obvious which enemies have those skills and give blue mages more ways to get those skills used on them. If some of the craziest blue magic like white wind has to get nerfed a little to deal with this I think itd be worth it just to make blue magic more convenient.,FinalFantasy,dg3ruo1,6,t5_2qhdi

11545299,0,t1_dg44c9h,No they are important. You just gotta look at it in a bit of a different way.Caius and Yeul are sort of a parallel to Serah and Noel.Serah like Yeul has been granted foresight but young death.Caius is forced to watch Yeul die from the visions but she will get brought back time and time again and finally letting his emotions and feelings take control decided to end this cycle by destroying the future.Noel knows Serah will die permanently if they continue but they still push on putting Noels feelings aside for what they think is a better future.Caius and Yeul are there to show that they have an infinite road together but Caius cant accept the future with Yeul dying even though a similar Yeul will take her place.While Serah and Noel have a very limited road but will accept the consequences for a hopefully better future.It shows that even though Serah and Noel are weaker they are driven by the fact that they wanted a better future at the cost of more while Caius was driven by a selfish reason for the cost of nothing.But thats looking into it to much. Noel and Serah had Friendship plot armour that beat Caius not gonna lie.Honestly i felt like Light got forgotten about at the destroyed village scene up till the end where shes a statue but that was when i started all the side stuff so it could be worse than i remember.,FinalFantasy,dg4ntyc,1,t5_2qhdi

11704373,0,t1_dgkfkgz,V builds on and improves pretty much everything about III which means that V is an objectively better game than III so I would go with V over III. III is also notoriously difficult and grindy whereas V is more balanced. You can more or less go with whatever jobs you choose in V for the most part. III is mostly the same except for some instances particularly a couple of gimmicky bosses where certain jobs are obviously a better choice. Itll be pretty easy to tell when you get to those points. The other thing about V is that freelancers are actually the best job in the game if you put the work in for them. They get stat boosts from nearly every other job you have mastered with that character taking from each mastered jobs best stat so mastering thief will give you amazing speed as a freelancer for example. You should keep this in mind when choosing jobs for each character throughout the game but other than that you can do what you want probably up until the final dungeon where a wellbuilt freelancer team will make the last few hours a breeze.,FinalFantasy,dgmpkgm,1,t5_2qhdi

11745889,0,t1_dgr7wl4,Yeah like I said I like the concept but it was executed poorly. The game becomes dull when you can just spam attack and destroy literally everything in the game. Maybe limiting the amount you can draw until a certain level. Another big problem is the levelling system which actively encourages you to avoid battles.,FinalFantasy,dgrfcpk,1,t5_2qhdi

Other than being super soldiers theres really nothing joining the plot arcs of Terra and Cloud.  The Espers in  were actual minor actors in the story while the materia in  was just magical fuel.  There is no WaroftheWorlds conflict between Shinra and some crossdimensional world.  It was purely an internal class struggle between economic elites and impoverished citizens.  Theres no giant meteor in  and no Warring Triad in .And thats just the high points.  The individual character arcs are completely distinct the Zack revelation Clouds longing for dead Aerith Barretts handless exfriend KatSith the Shinra insider and Cids epic rocket launch have no FF parallel.Kefka stole the show in  while Sephiroth was honestly something of a background figure for much of .Theres just no comparing the two games save on the most superficial level.,FinalFantasy,dgsnn8b,2,t5_2qhdi

11777724,0,t1_dguzang,gt Magic magic you have to grind within the grind.This has been answered before. Its a basic gaming concept to grind for points then spend the points. Happens in FFX FFXII in different forms. Calling it a grind within a grind is just negative spin doctoring. gtIt may be dramatic but a majority of people dont like it and Im certainly not alone. Everyone says they hate drawing I dont think you have those stats. And weve also mentioned how drawing is only a minor mechanic in this game. gtIn fact what magic is in FFVIII is items. Items are disposable and magic should not be but in FFVIII theyre one and the same. Just realised that.I think this is the key point  you want magic to be MP based and youre upset FFVIII didnt do it that way. ,FinalFantasy,dgv1jbw,1,t5_2qhdi
11794557,0,t3_687rou,Yea it seems the car has a good amount of issues. I had it clip through like  bridges. Had one time I got out and teleported me into the bridge but the car got sent to the top where it should be about  feet above me. Got to see an amazing Noctis faceplant when I tried to warp to the car and clipped right through the bridge again.Havent played in a couple months except for chocomog fest so its kinda concerning if the Regalia is still having these silly problems on new updates.,FinalFantasy,dgwybeg,1,t5_2qhdi
