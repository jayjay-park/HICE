2140814,0,t3_2ja5m6,. Begin by creating a new Layer. From the colour picker define a colour C M Y K or if using RGB R   G   B  .. Now fill the new layer with this colour.. Select Add noise from the Noise Section under filters and apply an amount of  this is just a value for demonstraion any subtle amount will do this just works for me usually.. Now change the Layer Blending Mode of this Layer to Overlay.. You should now see that the original image underneath this layer has a fine grain running through it. To alter the appearance of this grain if you wish I suggest transforming the layer you just created or by altering its opacity.From here ,LearningPhotoshop,clby0pp,1,t5_2wdf7
2907919,0,t3_2tfggy,See if your local library has some photography books. Learning composition skills will help your Photoshop skills! If you feel as though the trains colors are out of place change them! I feel as though the bright spot in the background is the primary focus draw for my eye rather than the train. Just thought I would add that on to help the overall piece.,LearningPhotoshop,cnymyk9,2,t5_2wdf7
3102696,0,t3_2vow14,Wouldnt one figure after dealing with this forever I have found a work around. Lock and unlock the layer. Seems to work just fine now. It somehow pulls it in as locked even though it is unlocked. I guess by locking and then unlocking it repairs that bug and life goes on.,LearningPhotoshop,cojld6w,1,t5_2wdf7
3329391,0,t3_2yacku,If I understand correctly all you need to do is create a layer above everything else and fill it with the color. Then in the layers panel find the drop down menu. Change the mode from normal to most likely overlay and adjust the opacity of the layer to your liking. You can also play with different modes in the same drop down menu. Hope this helps!,LearningPhotoshop,cp7s051,2,t5_2wdf7
5210007,0,t3_3maw45,Good stuff thanks for sharing. Ive been using Photoshop for almost  years but Im self taught and not this good. Can you recommend any books or anything to get me close to your level? I tried taking a class once but the teacher was a novice himself unfortunately. ,LearningPhotoshop,cvdzyhm,2,t5_2wdf7
5369087,0,t3_3ohzuj,Cool idea. If the resolution and focus isnt there in the first place sharpening will not bring it back. Sharpening will simply enhance the contrast of small details already present in the image making them more visible.Anyway the first step is to make a good scan youre past this step but I will include it anyway just ot be thorough. Scan at a higher resolution than you need this makes it easier to work with and easier to remove dust and scratches.   A calibrated scanner with a ccd sensor instead of CIS will do wonders by the way.If you scanned at high enough resolution you hopefully will not need to upsample the image to get it to the size you need. And you might not need to add grain to cover up the low resolution as the grain already in the image might suffice. Once you have cleaned up dustscratchesetc. you can try some sharpening if your image feels a bit soft. Use a radius that matches the content of your image if you scanned at a high resolution this will likely be a bit larger than usual. Tweak to taste.If you need to adjust colours I can recommend curves adjustment layers.

8704310,0,t3_4xpg5x,Hi nice job so far. A few things. First open your image and look at the Histogram notice how its all far to the left. On an image like yours this is a good indication that it lacks dynamic range. Id suggest doing a Curves Adjustment Layer and under the word Preset his a hand with two arrows click that then click on your lighter areas to the right of the tower and pull that up a bit. Then if you want to go to a dark area such as the left of the tower and pull that back down a little.The other thing is your shadows are not in agreement. Since this appears to be a night image there should be very little shadow to begin with but the shadow on the guy is very long and coming from behind him. If thats the case his back should be illuminated. But then the tower appears to be getting lit from a different angle entirely.Other than that really nice job. The atmosphere was done pretty well great layering of the trees too!,LearningPhotoshop,d6to829,1,t5_2wdf7
