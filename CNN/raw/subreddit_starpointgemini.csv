2029033,0,t1_ckxkmtw,Did you wander into a higher level area?Also are you trying to fight in that freighter? Youre basically a gunboat without any maneuverability or the ability to evade anything.,starpointgemini,ckxqfqz,1,t5_2yi8g
2050023,0,t1_cl08izk,Is it? I cant find any documentation regarding it. ,starpointgemini,cl0eioc,1,t5_2yi8g
3983981,0,t1_cradgkn,I mean like even in Zelda  on the NES all the NPCs can at least speak to you.  And in like Baldurs Gate lots of people have things to say or ways you can use your charisma etc. on them.  I get that designing an entire conversation system and writing out lots of unique dialogue is an enormous undertaking but even like a basic hail would be cool.  Rather than just getting shouted at by raiders ,starpointgemini,craeqnp,1,t5_2yi8g

7305513,0,t1_d288jfo,thanks for the response. I figured it out from the above and using the help section which actually helped for change! Its worth mentioning that if its an enhancement for say the cloak you have to be on the Cloak in the systems tab of drydock for it to appear in the options list of upgrades to buy and equip. The upgrade actually makes a noticeable difference to my cloak. Just went diagonally across the map at full PTE with the cloak on and wasnt shot at once. Rasza FTW!,starpointgemini,d28l5uu,1,t5_2yi8g
