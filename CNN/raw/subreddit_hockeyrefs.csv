2865454,0,t3_2suwiz,My suggestion would be to contact the the local hockey leagues in your area.  Find out who the RIC Referee in Chief is for the league and then reach out to that person.,hockeyrefs,cntswsc,2,t5_2sqb7
3021057,0,t1_cmynu68,I had a coach complain to my RIC recently about playing chuckapuck with the other linesman. The situation? There had just been a line brawl and the home teams goalie got ejected. So while we had  minutes to kill the other linesman was trying to get the puck to stop at the centre dot by throwing it from the bench. And if he didnt succeed I was tossing it back to him. The fans on both sides loved it. The home team loved it. The visiting coach? Not so much.Not doing that again... lol,hockeyrefs,cob4otm,1,t5_2sqb7

5358744,0,t1_cvwmfda,what Im just trying to get at is that Im not going to be a complete idiot out there. i may not be able to just hop in and ref at a high level but Im not going to be a complete idiot either. I get Im going to have to start at the bottom in a low pool and my  years experience are not going to change that but Im not going to come in like a first time ref who cant back up his calls and is too afraid to call penalties. what Im getting at is that it may not be valuable to evaluators but it will be helpful to have at least some experience. Say for example i had been a ball umpire. That experience as a ump is going to help me be able to look for small details even though they are completely different details. Its going to help me with knowing how to handle coaches.,hockeyrefs,cvwn1vc,1,t5_2sqb7
5650020,0,t3_3sfbcj,Just when I thought Ive heard every absurd situation possible... Id probably just watch in awe and end up letting it go.Without looking in the book Id think ineligible player might be possible since youre only allowed one goaltender on the ice? To me premature substitution is strictly for when the tendy is pulled for an extra attacker the extra attacker doesnt even need to touch the puck for it to be called so Id feel inclined to call it ineligible or too many men. I dont think youll ever have to put this one into practise. Ever.,hockeyrefs,cwxfuif,1,t5_2sqb7

8729314,0,t3_4zjo90,Not a big deal. When I was going for my level one I wore jeans and a hoodie. Just have a black helmet white laces and a whistle. ,hockeyrefs,d6wt3qi,1,t5_2sqb7
8947549,0,t3_51uqhr,I have a partner who uses it its terrible and really loud. My partners solution is to wear earplugs not get a new whistle.  ,hockeyrefs,d7nd34i,1,t5_2sqb7

11349538,0,t3_61w5h4,I cant remeber what kicked it all off but for some reason the coach was squirting his water bottle at the other official. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to skate over and try and snatch it from him. Got a face full of water for my troubles.    ,hockeyrefs,dfig6nf,2,t5_2sqb7
