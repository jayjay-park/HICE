8113842,0,t3_4qd332,I believe this Wilipedia article may be of assistance to you Magnetosphere of Jupiter To simply put it Jupiters immense radiation is a byproduct of the planets magnetosphere. To quote the articlegt The action of the magnetosphere traps and accelerates particles producing intense belts of radiation similar to Earths Van Allen belts but thousands of times stronger.,junomission,d4s2i7e,5,t5_3exr0

8814041,0,t1_d768w9z,Again as I stated in the post the misalignment is on purpose not a sideaffect. JunoCam is a pushframe camera that intentionally captures overlapping strips so that its guaranteed that there isnt any gaps in coverage when assembling the strips. Image processors who are infinitely better and more experienced than I am probably do have scripts that employ automatically a process similar to what I had described  every strip has some features that are identical to the next strip and so theyre matched. Adjusting for things like for example the shape of the planet when the image was taken can be accounted for afterwards with scripts that can produce accurate projections such as this one,junomission,d77bt8c,2,t5_3exr0
