1408778,0,t1_cis5pgg,I know that feeling. I also went through periods where they kept asking me to contact them via a different method everytime they replied but not actually address anything i.e. instead of forum PM please email then please use hashtrader then zendesk etc... I know its just a stall tactic. But at least stalling means they eventually get around to resolving. Unfortunately for me and you it turns out its just stalling and hoping you give up.Were you at least successful in your chargebacks?,GAWMiners,cisvbrs,1,t5_314ex

1644710,0,t3_2d5s4q,They are a reward for keeping your bitcoin with them.  Every day youll get a certain amount depending on how much bitcoin you have in your ZenMiner account.  They have stated that you should get about  to  annually and you can use the mined bitcoins to purchase new hardware directly in the ZenPortal ZenMarket so think of it as interest that can only be used against their products.I think  ZenPoint is . BTC and is deducted from the price of the item automatically when you buy.,GAWMiners,cjmh9xi,1,t5_314ex

2511022,0,t3_2oda9k,Wow Finally somebody asked this all elusive question. These people can dispute the legitimacy of this question all day but it really comes down to common sense. If the first operation didnt succeed. Why the hell would anybody especially a smart investor. invest in the second operation?Logically it makes no sense!  If the first operation was so great why create a second operation?It really has come down to Paycoin or Bust which is really disappointingbecause as an investor you cant fall back on the first operation its a waste of time. The maintenance fees are outrageous. So now GAW is padding their businessto keep customers from losing which is great but most of them have no idea that they would have made more money trading Bitcoin on an exchange than mining or waiting around for paycoin to takeoff.As it stands right now Only time will tell. I have lost hope because I believe  GAW has lost its way. When you create another coin you have chosen to go against Bitcoin instead of with it. The developers of Bitcoin like Gavin have said that altcoins are a waste of time and dont help Bitcoin. Features are what Bitcoin needs which is the whole reason behind sidechains and Bitcoin . So we will all sit back and watch this ball of Flames either rise from the ashes or crash and burn.,GAWMiners,cmmbupj,7,t5_314ex
