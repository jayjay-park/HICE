4871201,0,t1_cu8jaxb,No clue! I just saw the post in the main sub and thought Id cross post it since I figure not everyone checks it everyday I usually dont. Id suggest approaching the organizers and asking them a little bit about the event perhaps write up a local system story for each of the faction capitals and then write up a galnet submission for after the event. If people could attend thatd be great! Depending on where it is and how busy I am on that day I might stop by but I cant guarantee Ill be there. Wouldnt hurt to have multiple people to go if others are interested of course.,ElitePress,cu8jw2e,1,t5_39dwd

4942716,0,t1_cuhkclb,I really like the idea of this article. And the idea of Winged exploration as well  Ive tried to organise it myself with some friends but of course it requires being able to organise a serious chunk of time where you can stick together and not wander off and break the wing over about a week or more.,ElitePress,cuhkhgl,1,t5_39dwd
5009205,0,t1_cupqi5v,I think this reads okay. I would like to point something out  if you want a more neutral article D There are likely refugees not just fleeing Archon but also the Imperials. Both powers are advancing and causing millions if not billions of deaths. In the lore it states that Archon and Kumo make some systems better off than before the Kumo Crew arrived meaning some systems are going to be people fleeting Imperial invasion.   Let me emphasise  it reads fine as it is  I just think you cant limit the refugees to only fleeing one group D,ElitePress,cupsr7h,1,t5_39dwd

5141205,0,t1_cv5c3mx,Ive made a few changesgtSenate Report Reveals Patronage Gains.gtgtA Senate report tracking political trends shows marked swings towards patronage governments throughout Empire space.gtgtThe systems of Vodyanes amp HIP  highlight the reports key finding  corporations and dictatorships swept away by Empire assemblies and societies  codes of obligation and respect replacing boardroom decisionmaking and the diktat of juntas.gtgtWhy many citizens are returning to traditional patronclient relationships is unclear although the report offers some possible explanations traditionalism may offer comfort following Hengist Duvals assassination or escape from anxieties brought on by the Pegasi Pirate War.gtgtSomewhat outlandishly the report suggests that organised groups of pilots may be responsible for covertly supporting some governments on behalf of certain unnamed powerful individuals.gtgtWhen approached a spokesperson for the Chapterhouse of Inquisition an advocacy group for patrons and feudal lords based in Kamadhenu was keen to point out the virtues of traditional governance but declined to comment on the particulars of the Senate report.gtgtCMDR Edgar StarwalkergtgtCapitol Herald | Interstellar PressI went with replacing boardroom decisionmaking and the diktat of juntas. for some extra flavour think it sounds ok?,ElitePress,cv5pgum,1,t5_39dwd
