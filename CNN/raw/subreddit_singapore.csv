95919,0,t1_cepbon6,Yes sure. Ive heard of a story when somebody failed English o levels and appealed into yishun jc. And is now doing well in their career. Just head down to the jc to have a talk with the respective in charge. It would help a lot if you have outstanding cca to help you appeal. Like table tennis or badminton. But let me leave you with another thought. Have you considered the difficulty of a levels. In my opinion a level is exponentially more difficult than o levels. And Im not talking about intelligence as a factor but the fact that you have lots to catch up academically. Im a jc dropout studying in a polytechnic now. I regret not thinking it through and thinking I could depend on my ability to study. Of course the decision is up to you but I urge you to take time and seriously think for yourself.

Also their overcrowding is due to locals within their country gravitating towards cities in search of better opportunities which is different from the massive foreign influx in SG that is somewhat engineered by our government. Moreover those examples you pointed out are cities in larger countries which is different from Singapore as we are a city state. While those in other nations may seek shifts to other areas within their country that are less crowded Singaporeans are mostly confined to their own island. This is why it matters more to compare population density across nations rather than at city levels.

1313689,0,t1_cihcfiw,It should be noted that it is very common for domestic helpers here to seek out sexual activity among their social group but from what I hear few of them are foolish enough to do it within their employers home. Most likely she will take the time on her off day for sex if thats what you think shes up to. She is entirely within her right to engage in those activities and as her employer you do not legally have the authority to stop her. If she is seeking out intercourse in her work time you are allowed to refrain her from doing so but you cannot accuse on suspicion alone. Best to leave it alone as long as it not affecting her work requirements. Make the distinction between domestic work and corporate work.I also think it is unlikely that she will practice unsafe sex as most of the schools that the domestic helpers learn English from in their respective countries also accommodate the sponsored teaching of safe sexual practice at least by word of mouth. ,singapore,cihenmy,5,t5_2qh8c

If you dont like it there may be a nd chance in further studies if you or your family has the capital but for now learn to like what you are learning because everything hinges on this  years.Welcome to the best  years of your life. Youll make some great buddies make some enemies whether you like it or not and because you are also coming of age if you are fresh from secondary school experience a slight growth in your responsibilities and some really wild parties. Polytechnic is one place where youll start to see politics in action. Take it like a primer to how working life is just that the politics in Poly is like a playpen where mistakes are made friendships strengthen and broken without much worry about actual expulsion unless you really screw up.Dont worry about making mistakes thats what poly education is geared to do for you because you cant afford to be making the same mistakes when you enter the workforce.And never slack no matter how tempting parties or play can be. One bad semester can really hurt your GPA and grades not to mention your ability to continue with certain modules. It is fine to party but only when you know the grade is secured.My  years in NYP were the most memorable time where I learnt to overcome social anxiety from a very special person. I found love lost love made some of the greatest friends one could have hurt some people unintentionally.My advice Dont sweat the small stuff have fun and make friends and you will know who are your true friends when shit hits the fan.,singapore,cito707,7,t5_2qh8c

Anyone can google things and google comes up with dangerous results sometimes if misinterpreted by the layperson. The point I was making in my head was not taking things at face value just because it is on the internet and written by experts. I looked through hisher post history as well and based on some information in past posts assumed that heshe has some idea of critical evaluation of sources and ability to look up credible resources. Hence my snootiness. I knew what I was doing in posting my comments without the backing information. I.e. I was being a dick. Admittedly.Back to JKlahs point on debarking his main issue was that it should be offered as an option. My opinion as mentioned in another independent comment this thread and in line with AVA guidelines are that IF mentioned as an option must also mention that the AVAs recommendation that it only be conducted if it eases painsufferingdiseasedisability are adhered to.

Trying to stick all your US plugs into a US surge protector and plugging it into the Singapore power mains is not going to happen as the frequencies are different and it will trip the circuit board of your new home. Having all your stuff plugged into a surge protector makes sense anyway  Singapore has thunderstorms more frequently than what the typical American expects save for Oregon and Washington and youre not going to want all those surges to wreck the lifespan of your stuff.As for region compatibility there are no region locks for the PS but I cant answer that for the Xbox One as the console has yet to be released in Singapore.

Think about it for a bit and it makes sense  what Americans sometimes think is Mandarin over there is actually Cantonese. The Hokkien influence in Southeast Asia can be seen especially in countries like Thailand and Cambodia where they have successfully assimilated into the local population. Thaksin Shinawatra is a Thai Chinese. Dialect groups in Singapore were often stratified by their trade and thus their social class the Hokkien were generally the wealthiest and controlled things like shipping and trade whereas the Cantonese were much poorer and were engaged in things like carpentry and other forms of manual labour.,singapore,ckz8n4c,1,t5_2qh8c

2139696,0,t1_claxvpz,Thats actually a really good quote. It says so much with so little.I think the reason for such behaviour is that people default to viewing others as their occupation instead of as another human being. Its much easier to just identify somebody as cleaner or cashier in your mind when you already have other shit to worry about. As a result we simply expect things to happen without considering that those things happen because another person does it.Personally I like to see myself as part of the team almost as if I was their colleague. There is no us and them customer and staff mentality. Its just Im here to put food in my mouth youre in the position to do so lets do this as efficiently as we can taking into consideration that there are other people around me who also want to put delicious sustenance through the watering entrances of their digestive systems.Once I was having lunch with colleagues at a tiny eatery which literally only had one auntie handling all the operations  serving cooking dishwashing cashier etc. I figured we would be waiting for a long time if we just sat there so I went into the kitchen to help her.

But nevermind since i am in a good mood i give you  minutes to tidy up and stand by bed.  Understood?Slightly puzzled our sergeant was a crazy mofo we ran up to the fifth floor platoon  f our lives and got the shock of our lives. mattresses were on the floor bedsheets strewn everywhere. our table was overturned in the centre of the room and the chairs were hanging from the ceiling. cabinets turned upside down. and best of all the door to my section was blocked by two metal cabinets. we had to ram down the door to get in. The other sections were in a similar state.

Also living on a small island with your family so close by seems like it would be a great way to help ease the transition from being a high school student to being a soldier.  I definitely dont see Singaporeans as pussies.  You live on an island surrounded by countries that if they were so inclined could make life here pretty unpleasant.

People make mistakes a driver could be distracted or a cyclist could easily speed through a red light and knock you down. It does not take very much effort to be more vigilant when your life is in danger while crossing the road. Its a simple cost benefit analysis. Someone used the Slippery Slope Fallacy to justify that one cannot be vigilant all the time to have a meaningful life. Im just saying that crossing the road is a situation that warrants some increased vigilance that doesnt take up a lot of effort. Other risks that are beyond our control  such as food poisoning from an unseen kitchen we just have to live with.Notice in the video that the other party crossing the road did see the vehicle and jumped back in time. No one is blaming the lady for getting hurt but we all can do a bit more to protect ourselves in situations like these. ,singapore,cnrjujo,1,t5_2qh8c
2847654,0,t3_2slz0g,Agreed OP. The people who maintain that they are right arent always the ones that are alive.

Along with the rising spread of global extremism by ISIS and certain other forces some of these students could see radicalism as a better and easier path in life.Of course this can also happen with Chinese Students Indian students and the like I just feel that due to the spread of extremism globally and the fact that Malay students in general dont do as well Malay students are the ones more likely to be disillusioned.,singapore,cnsfbut,4,t5_2qh8c

2986485,0,t1_co7j72m,Longer busstops do exist so I wouldnt discount m as being an exaggeration. Even if it was an average busstop perhaps they decided to stand further away because all of the seats were taken. If one doesnt want to move because one is already comfortable or there isnt another seat available then one should be prepared for ones view to be obstructed to some degree. Demanding an unbridled view just because one is seated just smacks of entitlement. Those who are standing need to watch for their buses as well so they can only be so considerate. Even if they move back and forth to watch its still going to obscure the views of those seated. A little bit of give and take makes the world a better place.,singapore,co7jok7,1,t5_2qh8c
2987365,0,t1_co7l0w4,Heh. I did some rough math. The PoW class was about  million pounds assuming Wiki figures are accurate.  million pounds at the WW GBPUSD exchange rate was  million US dollars. Tossing  million into an inflation calculator gives me  million dollars. Works out to about  million SGD today.Or alternatively using  million pounds as our base figure I get a figure of  million to  million pounds depending on which inflation calculator is used today. Which works out to approximately  million to  million SGD.Based on those figures we could actually afford an entire fleet of battleships and support vessels with our current military budget.Going with an alternative estimate of million USD we get a present day cost of . billion USD or . billion SGD. Substantially higher but a fleet would still be within our grasp.,singapore,co7myht,5,t5_2qh8c

It looks like you have written your entire post fueled by emotion and to an unbiased rd party your story has gaping holes in them. We are a community who is more than willing to help anyone who is in trouble but your choice of words have been pretty offensive. How about recounting the events of the entire night?. What were you doing before? Were you drunk? Genuine question. It was midnight at Raffles Place plenty of bars there.  . What the hell happened with the taxi driver? Did he ask you were you were going? And if he did were you going the same place? Did he just randomly get out of his cab to hit you? Did you say anything? Because honestly no one in the right mind would get out of a taxi to beat on a guy white or not for no reason. This is the part that really gets me.  . Why wouldnt the police help you? Because I have always known the SPF to be extremely fair.  . Why not try the embassy again? If they really dont want to interfere with the courts ask them what your options are. They can help you contact your family who can then send you money for a good lawyer.  . Why not borrow money from your girlfriend to once again get a good lawyer. If you are really innocent you will be cleared and you can pay her back.Honestly Singapore isnt as backwards as you seem to thing it is. We have a very fair justice system and we are not all xenophobic who hates angmohs. Like I said your story has massive holes in them. How about filling them up first and then we can really start to help.,singapore,codtmn6,11,t5_2qh8c

However it was clear these were catchphrases and did not become a part of everyday language for the most part.On top of that Singlish is constantly evolving through use and that probably has a bigger effect on the way students write and speak due to their constant exposure.An interesting classroom exercise is to have students examine characters through dialogue.

Basically the groom gathers up his brothers aka groomsmen and they go to the brides house.At the brides house they have to prove their worth via a series of challenges set by the bridemaids.

Personally my side effects were annoying but manageable it was either headaches or general sleepiness. If youre on a budget cheapest way is as already pointed out going to a polyclinic and asking for a referral. Since its the most budgetfriendly method it goes without saying that its also the longest method duration wise.

3483707,0,t1_cpp9u6i,You need to go deeper. A large number of Americans also believe the American Dream the fundamental expression of meritocracy is dead. As you noted theres a huge stated emphasis on meritocracy but not to the same degree as us and its more historic than present and the truth is anything but. Theres a reason why I mentioned Jeffersonian meritocracy has largely fallen by the wayside and has in fact been largely dead for a while. If you know anything about education in the US and I mean truly know its been dead for a while but only widely known more recently. If anything its more alive among immigrants to the US than those whose roots are established there.In interest of full disclosure I studied and worked in a field that specifically deals with the issue of inequality and meritocracy in the States so Im kinda meh about discussing this.Ah you looked up the same definition of nepotism. I prefer Wikipedias which expounds on how it is usually exercised in the field of politics. gtNepotism is favoritism granted in politics or business to relatives.gtNepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications.Alternatively gt favoritism as in appointment to a job based on kinship The thing is could you say for certain that it was based only on kinship? You seem to think so and you can certainly make a case for it. I think its less certain as LHL also happened to demonstrate what was demanded by our system academic excellence. The others? You have better grounds to work with. Ho Ching was also a scholar and at least somewhat academically qualified but Im not particularly impressed by her. Oh great so now were dismissing points. Sure. I dont see how thats the only logical conclusion but okay. Sure. If you go with our claims of being meritocratic and take into account LHLs academic achievements cant speak for his military ones since we didnt exactly go off and win wars maybe he truly was the best guy or at least the best they knew of. Did his dad being LKY have anything to do with him being known? Sure and I acknowledged that earlier. The point is I dont see his position as being a blatantly clear case of nepotism like you do. Incidentally theres no might be some historical justifications its a fact. The rate of expansion of the SAF coupled with the fact that we had quite a number of foreign born officers particularly at higher ranks meant that there was a serious need to push people up the ranks. Its not a perfect system but I understand why it happened. LHL was not the sole beneficiary of that system.  Did LHL get a boost? Yes visibility is a huge plus. Was it deliberate? Possibly but cant say for certain thanks to his demonstrated academic qualities and intelligence. Is his position undeserved? Cant say for certain either way due to the same reason.

3546813,0,t1_cpwhwon,I think the kid is very much like  year old me. Frustrated with the system with being unable to fit in uncomfortable with society around me. Somewhat attentionseeking too and in all honesty I cant say Im not like that. In some ways I can commiserate with him.Nevertheless I think hes only at the beginning of his political awakening. Hes still reciting the basic ideas of political commentary without accounting for cultural and situational differences or thinking about why democracy is important and under what conditions should it be implemented. At this point hes taking his ideas about governance from mainstream media. Hes not wrong for example suicide rates are high here but they seem to be closely related to mental illness and we cant quite tell if they are related at all to economic or working conditionssome studies say yes some say the opposite some inconclusive. Essentially hes the kid that said the wrong thing at the wrong time in the wrong place with the selfconfidence that can only be said to be an example of the DunningKruger effect.I agree that what he says is offensive but I dont think we should have charged him for it or overreacted in this manner. I dont even think he should have been punished we should have engaged him in conversation called him out on his weak arguments. Part of developing a population that actively participates in politics and feels a sense of belonging in their country is allowing the airing of contrary views even immature ones. How else are you allowed to make mistakes and learn from them and how are you supposed to be loyal to a country that simply took you along for the ride without a care for your opinions.But if you mean can we afford to risk civil conflict in order to allow for freedom of expression then I think the answer is no. I wish I lived in a society that allowed for that but we live in a seige mentality where north and south of us are nations that put up with rather than enjoy our company and the cultural composition in our country is not homogeneous enough to allow for true freedom of speech. And while I do think that part of it is fearmongering its also one of the cases where the propaganda doesnt stretch the truth very much and has been borne out in historical events.,singapore,cpwk56j,28,t5_2qh8c

Thats just a recipe for disaster especially since people know each other and rumors fly and all that jazz. Totally get you on the preach feminism bit btw I just smile and nod most times because I know fundamentally theyre nice people.So then that begs the question I dont know  who can you tolerate?I was probably insinuating that youd only date the very best and for that I suppose its because Im quite salty after reading your pastebin replies fuck off I wish I had  matches on Tinder but its true isnt it? If  is shit granted its a statement that applies broadly to humanity as a whole then maaaaaybe you should have asked how do i meet awesome guys to date?! instead of meeting guys right?As an aside I think it gets better as you get older. You know what you want they know what they want and theyre usually not relationship virgins or virgins for that matter and things will probably go more along your expected relationship trajectory. So you have two options  Sit tight and wait for that to happen living life in the meantime  Try instead to date one of those  guys lol. Dont drop your standards too far of course but I personally feel that relationship virgins tend to be extremely doting and all  which is what you want right?

Nothing more than showing off ones past history and glory. But showoff to who? International travellers? Maybe but how many would stop to think about the significance when the transit time can be as little as  minutes or remember to search later? Beyond the history books and lessons in the future how many will actually care much about the distant past than the present? Citizens? As it is now there are many things here that have LKYs name attached to it and I suspect there will be more i.e. Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy Lee Kuan Yew World City Prize Lee Kuan Yew AwardScholarship etc. There are plenty of ways to memoralise him and renaming is just one of the many ways.,singapore,cq7ldos,8,t5_2qh8c

Now your k estimate makes more sense.  This is because they receive no public funding to subsidize their tuition.  They have a high ranking which anonymous Wikipedia editors with dubious credibility noteDuring this time Northeastern has advanced in national rankings. It placed nd in the  U.S. News amp World Reports Best Colleges Guide a  position jump from  and enormous  place gain just since . Some have argued that Northeasterns recent rise in the rankings shows that the university has cracked the code to academic rankings while others have suggested that it has figured out how to game the system.Have you considered traveling there to visit or have you already?  With the cost of international tickets right now its nothing compared to what youre thinking of spending.  It will give you an idea if the culture there and resources available to you justify the expenditure.Its not too late to look into other universities.

3881833,0,t1_cqyjk3t,IMHOIf Amos could make things harder for his family he would. Its pretty clear in My Abusive Father that hes motivated by some sort of vengeance. He feels like his family has made life hard for him and he wants to get back at them.Thats also probably why he waved at the cameras when his dad was bowing. Youre not the boss of me now. Hes enjoying this illusion of control while it lasts.  Its probably the first time in his life he feels like he gets to control the outcome. See His blogposts about school his YouTube video about girlsA lot of selfdestructive behavior follows this sort of pattern. Some people knowingly do drugs etc in an act of defiance against their circumstances. Its a sort of scorched Earth tactic the world wont have them so theyll watch it burn and laugh even if it hurts them and makes things hard for them. From Amoss point of view life is hard and pointless ANYWAY. Might as well smile wave and eat a banana.Its also interesting how the rest of us are conditioned to call it stupid selfish etc. Thats probably because were in social circumstances that we perceive to be beneficial. So we defend our own way of living and thinking and our own social contracts just as people in cities call the people of the hills barbarians or savages. Its not that theyre wrong which is always oversimplistic and reductive its that theyre different. Which we always struggle to accomodate until its too late and then we paint them as the Other and we villify them. Such is life I guess.,singapore,cqyrgdb,0,t5_2qh8c

3997199,0,t1_crbwjkh,You mean the way drivers payment are held over the weekend if we use credit card? The biggest flaw for current taxi companies IMO is that they have no incentives to pick up booking calls especially during peak hours where there are plenty of street customers about.Also no financial incentives to drive during heavy rain which is where bookings are made. So in a sense Uber tries to solve both of these concerns but even as an Uber driver now I still maintain the view that taxi drivers are more professional than uber drivers as of now having taken both regular taxis and Uberx quite a lot the past month.,singapore,crbwvtb,2,t5_2qh8c

4242426,0,t1_cs36nfr,Its pretty valid. Every single ball that flies into the box is an immediate danger to the defence because somehow they cant handle balls in the box. Every time. Shit defending. Our midfield is always missing and whenever Safirul and Pravin tackles  its a foul. Stupid tackling. Ive never seen our SEA games reps for soccer play so badly all these years. No stand out players. No bumper crop of young talent. Worst SEA games team ever. And lets not pretend that Aide wasnt given time. He was given the players and the job in  and did jack shit with them.

4259195,0,t3_39pdnv,So fighting games are e sports now... No leagues only Capcom pro tour utilizing the existing community driven tournaments and sanctioning them as point collecting venues. Oh and probably Topanga world league. The author probably doesnt know but fighting games has a huge way to go before being recognised as esports and its probably the worst example to use now. No doubt Xian is definitely striving to be an eathlete but he only did so recently after Capcom backed the prizes up for CPT with more prize money. FGC doesnt have valve level sponsorship to sell compendiums and make the prize money a couple million dollars. Athletes in fighting games are not necessarily paid a fixed salary for signing up with a sponsor they dont have coaches or mentors  of learning is done by yourself or with friendsfellow competitors.

Thats a lie I cannot live with. Its morally wrong and I would sooner throw myself off the bridge than be committed to doing that sort of action for the rest of my life. I didnt make friends just so I can earn a few more bucks off them. I also refuse to bring them into the environment since the motivation behind that is for my benefit rather than theirs. Its not luck. There is no such thing as luck when it comes to people.Its like kindness. You do not expect anything in return by helping others. If you do thats not kindness.

4465469,0,t1_cstjmd5,Id say the schools are better as opposed to private instructors because the learning is more structured. And you also get priority in booking practice sessions in the circuit. But it is slightly more expensive.In terms of the driving schools I think theyre the same? I was with SSDC when it was in Yio Chu Kang and had a pretty good experience. Cleared my driving lessons in three months and test in five. Just go to one thats nearest for you cause its a pain to travel and youll be going once or twice a week for a couple of months.Go to the school sign yourself up and theyll offer lessons on the theory as part of the package. Book your BTT pass it and youll start your practical lessons. Book your FTT and pass it. Book your TP the actual driving test and you get your driving licence!,singapore,cstjt07,2,t5_2qh8c
4466067,0,t1_cstku68,gtThere would be no need for demonstration in a society where information flows freely and the decision making process made transparently.Thats a rather naive view of things. Most protests occur because the protestors are unhappy with the decisions made by those in power whether its people clamouring for political reform or wage disputes between worker unions and their company. Even if the decision making process were  transparent there will still be protests if people are unhappy with the outcome of said process.,singapore,cstmi03,7,t5_2qh8c

4565123,0,t3_3dift5,I read the first article posted. Will get through the entire report soon.As someone mentioned it is reasonably balanced article. One thing that irks me but is reportedly true was thisgt Singapore has very little crime and virtually no official corruption. I like how he used the word official.  One thing my experience taught me is that crime rates posted by authorities are observed due to crimes being reported to the police and not by crimes actually being committed. As a criminologist we are always made to believe that the crimes rates reported is usually underestimated than the true crime that is happening on the streets. The same thing happens for corruption and white collar crime. Like any country in the world there will always be crime and if people think that crime does not happen thats just a myopic perspective. As a famous and successful advertising campaign says No crime doesnt mean low crime.Towards the end of the article I do agree with the author on his two challenges that Singapore has to meet. With the introduction of social media in recent times Singaporeans have another avenue to bitch and moan about the way things are run. So much so that the government is not equipped or well versed on how to deal with the social ramifications and it scares them. So unless Singapore goes by way of being China i.e. blocking social media the government needs to be able to speak with its citizens in a pragmatic sense as well as being more upfront about processes.

4577597,0,t1_ct7k921,I would love to see the statistics! If only MOE would commission a study. All they would have to do is to give us the data on local uni students PSLE grades and primary school.Although one must understand WHAT makes a good primary school. A branded school may be seen as good and have lots of rich kids in it. However it may be due to the fact that rich kids have tuition and stable homes. So even if you put a poor kid from a broken family into a branded primary school he might still not be successful in the long run.The study could be simple just compare rich kids in branded schools vs rich kids in neighbourhood schools. And poor kids in branded schools vs poor kids in neighbourhood schools. From there you can tell if its the school that makes a difference or if it is the money that makes the difference. My bet is on money.Maybe I have an unfair perspective. The uni friends I met were mostly from neighbourhood secondary schools. While the ones from my JC class that did not make in into local uni happened to have really good PSLE scores tooonly  out of  made it to local uni lol. At least they were better than mine.

Go out one day pretend to have met your dad and buy something nice for yourself. Get home and tell your brother look what daddy bought me too bad he doesnt love you. When he gets his grades back from school ask him why his grades so bad and why he so stupid. Doesnt matter if theyre bad or good. Just say it still. Criticise his every move. If he does anything clumsily or wrongly at home insult him and say something like how old already still dont know how to do this stupid idiot. Call him ugly and poor. Tell him hes dumb and will never find a pretty wife. His wife will be short and ugly and he will be poor and miserable etc.It might make you feel better. And if you show that you hate him enough he might lose any form of attraction for you and finally stop staring at you.Another unpopular solution get a boyfriend? Or even just a friend to pretend to be your bf. Like a wellbuilt kind. Bring him home often to intimidate your brother. Tell your pretend boyfriend to really intimidate him.

USm for election funding in Malaysia?! Najib kicks up a huge fuss about suing WSJ. Good luck with suing Dow Jones the company which owns WSJ and Dow Jones happens to be owned by News Corp.

Your housing choices are limited to apartments that arent really yours that cost so high you can afford a multistorey house elsewhere.Healthcare is expensive as well.Singapore may be somewhat saferand more convenient with so many Hour food outlets but on hindsight wheres the worklife balance in that?Live in a country with better wages less competition and considering youve got the right to be a Canadian citizen its really just the better choice.Then again Im just a bitter year old young man whos tired seeing his own year old father still working his ass off as people half his age.You might miss Singapores food and culture but unfortunately the reality of money and a roof over your head still persists.Good luck and Godspeed.,singapore,cu5s7yv,13,t5_2qh8c

Here is the big  and the foreign banks with their bureaucracy...See china indo or viet for exampe... Bank policies and procedures are probably less defined in those countries and sothere is a gap for new tech to meet their needs as they grow. Here the domestic market is a revolving chair where deposits move from one bank to another chasing the latest interest promotions.so in a small pie there is less incentive to do something different.

If you practice your skills enough you can actually spot some PAPOpposition BS that comes out of them. It makes you a little politically mature.Wanna give a test drive?

5692835,0,t3_3t0r9w,Hi OP Im in the media industry myself so I think I am able to advise you on this.First of all I need you to consider if you really want to write for newspapers. It is a difficult job with long working hours and little pay. The pay difference between a poly grad .k and a uni grad .k is not much considering how much you wouldve paid for your degree. The key here is to ask yourself have I done an internship at a newspaper publication and know that I want to commit my career to this?Lets assume that you have and you are pretty sure that you suit the industry. Instead of being concerned about the degree I would focus more on your portfolio. You portfolio should demonstrate that you are able to write well in the style of the newspaper that you are applying for eg hard news vs soft news. What publications look out for are if you are able to utilize news values well and if you can write succinctly. They dont want to have to train you to do the most basic job of writing news articles.All in all your degree matters not. Your portfolio is what will get you hired.  ,singapore,cx2r2i6,8,t5_2qh8c

5949607,1,t1_cxzikxx,It is expensive to the degree that funding a military would have severe deleterious impacts on the rest of the government budget. Lets take the ADF for exampleabout K personnel all together with a somewhat stronger Navy and somewhat weaker Air Force. Their Military budget is  Billion USD to our  Billion USDthats a significant chunk of our GDP for an overall smaller military force than what we maintain now. Thats a third of the Government budget for to fund that an inadequate defence would mean that essential social services would be cut. Thats rather silly.The alternative is of course having a military like Belgiums or Estonias at roughly  Billion USD but they would not present a viable deterrent and Singapore will lose a lot of its hard and soft power.You speak of the common citizenry spending more on the military than on consumer goodsthats a rather naive view. I assume you mean increased taxes for the labour forcethey will simply have less to spenddriving down our GDP and decreasing employment which proceeds in a circle until the economy is permanently depressed due to the increased taxes needed to fun even a sham of a professional military. In other wordsyou bankrupt the nation and thats not a good ideaEDIT Viewing NS as merely forced labour is quite a simplistic view.

So many passiveaggressive responses I think stem from some inability to possess a car while seeing others have one or just comparing cars i would be driving a benz and not this shitty QQ if i were in X country or just an inability to accept the policy that not everyone in Singapore is going to get a car.gt... which results in continued purchase of cars in overinflated prices and resentment within the society.If people like railing against individual preferences or the status quo for example many rsingapore redditors then surely it should not be taken as a given that people will be resentful it should not be taken for granted that people will acquiesce in the face of another person expressing such resentment.Sadly instead of discouraging such thought LTA embarked on COE changes in  that further entrenched it and actually went out of their way to distinguish and penalise luxury cars which happen to be more efficient from the rest as if we needed to feed this unhealthy perception of there being luxury and nonluxury even further.oh and I do not have a car and take public transport.,singapore,cymhxdy,1,t5_2qh8c

Honestly most single player rpgs dont have AMAZING stories and the gameplay isnt really that great. I guess its because singleplayer rpgs dont really have a high skillcap unless you are trying to speedrun it or something theyre designed to be playable by everyone which i find boring. If i wanted a good story i would rather read a visual novel or just a regular book or watch tv or something rather than slog through boring gameplay to get through a decent story.although KSP is pretty hard but Im not really a huge fan of that genre so i didnt bother playing it.,singapore,cynv03d,1,t5_2qh8c

6202485,1,t1_cyulzei,Marijuana can be used to treat pain so can a huge number of other things that also are very bad for you. This was a study on  people that showed smoking weed every single day had some effect on migraine headaches and that negative sideeffects were common. The conclusion was if youd bothered to post the whole text gtThe frequency of migraine headache was decreased with medical marijuana use. Prospective studies should be conducted to explore a causeandeffect relationship and the use of different strains formulations and doses of marijuana to better understand the effects of medical marijuana on migraine headache treatment and prophylaxis.You linked one small experiment thats not conclusive medical study. Also the results are an absolute joke. It shows that smoking weed every day reduced the chance of migraines occurring in  of the subjects. How is this supposed to be a better alternative to existing treatments? Marijuana has never been discovered to have any medical benefits where there isnt already an existing treatment that is superior with less side effects. If Im at work and I get a headache I could smoke a joint or shoot up some heroine or snort a monster line of ket and all of those things would make my headache go away.

6346758,0,t1_czaxpnt,Yes the intent to commit crime is enough to convict for an attempted crime as per Section  of the Criminal Attempts Act EnglandgtIn English law an attempt is defined as doing an act which is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence according to the Criminal Attempts Act . The test of proximity was that the defendant must have ...crossed the rubicon burnt his boats or reached a point of no return. So the defendant has reached that part of the series of acts which if not interrupted frustrated or abandoned would inevitably result in the commission of the intended offence. But section  of the Criminal Attempts Act  defines the actus reus as that is ...more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence that allowed liability to attach slightly earlier in the sequence of acts. Subsequent ratio decidendi have abandoned the more formal common law last step test leaving it to the jury to decide.gtSection  of the Criminal Attempts Act  applies the Act even though the facts are such that the commission of the offence is impossible so long as under section  the defendant believes that he is about to break the law and intends to commit the relevant full offence. This reverses the House of Lords decision in Haughton v Smith which had held it to be a good defence if the intended crime was factually or legally incapable of fulfillment. This change in the law avoids any problem in an early arrest because once in police custody it is extraordinarily difficult to commit the full offence. Further both the incompetent criminal who fails because the means adopted are inadequate e.g. intends to poison a victim but the amount administered is harmless or makes a false statement that does not deceive the intended victim and the unlucky thief who find the pocket or purse empty can now be convictedWe are a common law country so this should be convincing enough.Sorry have to get some work done so forgive this lazy reply. Theres a couple of issues bound up here which is is an attempt to use a love potion if it exists equivalent to or worse to using roofies and are his acts enough to convict for an attempted crime if so what kind. Given that his love potion contained roofies this makes the first question both simpler and also a bit more muddled.As for whether his act is enough to convict for an attempted crime the elements are present mens rea and actus reas although his mens rea is slightly different but perhaps more morally wrong. The crime we can simply take from some sample case where roofies were used.Ill add more when I have time but itll be late tonight or tomorrow,singapore,czb20zu,1,t5_2qh8c

Releasing hisher name would most likely being harm to himher.And they had CCTV footage of the alleged molestation and supposedly it was clear enough to identify the kid. Whether its true no one knows and likely due to the nature of this case no one will know.gtFrom what I know CCTV is often grainy and unclear correct me if Im wrong. Short answer MaybeLong answer It mostly depends on the type of camera you use and the system it saves the footage to. CCTVs have to record constantly without breaks and save the footages for weeks if not months. Try taking a  minute video with your phone look at how much storage it takes and multiply that by . Thats just  hour worth of footage. If the system has terabytes of storage for each camera you can assume its p similar to the video on your phone. gtI dont understand how our police became this secretive and closemindedBecause they arent supposed to talk about open investigations and are supposed to keep information private until investigation concludes.

6446447,0,t1_czm3gef,gtDo you think badly of SJWs and feminists?No shit. SJWs have become the most insincere demographic in the name of equality and have devolved to clinging to postmodernist mental gymnastics to justify their horseshit. SJWs were eager to support protesters at the  Baltimore Riots but they were retarded. I was there and protesters were screaming WORLDSTARRRRRR while recording themselves beating the crap out of cars and public property. Black Lives Matter is an insincere movement  the vast majority of those involved are there to get views on WSHH.As for feminists? Ill skip past the usual grievances and come to this  years ago I got into an open disagreement with a classmate during class discussion and right after class she grabbed me by the collar and openly threatened to accuse me of rape so the resulting school and police investigation would get me deported from the United States. It didnt help that no thanks to the strong feminist character of the school it wouldve sided with her without even getting my end of the tale. Feminists are no better than the Christian moral majority who tried to impose their moral codes on society  decades ago. Fuck em all.gtBut Im a nonbeliever of dress codes really.

The science involved in the job is as appealing to me as the art side of nursing which needs a lot of soft skills like being able to communicate with the patient etc. Personally I just find it more applicable in real life? Compared to being stuck at a deskbound job doing presentations and proposals for clients etc  nothing against those jobs but I think thats just not for me. I may be looking at things through rose tinted lenses but my parents are quite old and I think the skills I learn will inevitably come in useful if touch wood my parents fall sick when theyre much older. Ive joined attachment programs yes but theyre organised by MOHH whos also offering the healthcare scholarships and trying to attract the younger generation.

6537416,0,t1_czvbzur,I once found out the same too that a group of friends were secretly going out without me. At least one of your friends came clean when approached. Mine still denied blatantly any of that happening. One of them slipped up that that weekend they were going ice skating and wanted to jio me along with the other two. Then realised his mistake and tried to play down the invite. Then I asked the other two casually cajoling them why go ice skating never jio one. Then they kept pushing it away saying things like oh no la that one cancelled. Not going anymore. Or worst is a got meh? Since when we going ice skating? Only know we going to makan and chill at pubI gave up on asking and felt theres no point trying to go if they dont want me to. Itll be awkward anyway. Come weekend Instagram. They were careful enough not to post pictures with each other because they knew I was on their tracks. But they still posted individual pictures of themselves on ice. All three of them. At the same time. Obvious aint it as much as you deny it?So I gave up again this time on the friendship. No point keeping friends like these around when they dont treasure you as a friend. Even if you start asking me out again I might see it as Im nothing more than a back up friend. Friends are there to support each other and have fun along the way.

6619945,0,t1_d041ax2,Im not trying to argue with you for arguments sake.  Im just telling you that you are factually wrong.  Please investigate further to confirm if Im lying or not.Here is how youre factually wrong Mr. Lim told the SPF he was pushed.  He didnt mention a punch until he was at the hospital. The doctor who examined him only found bruising on left knee and small superficial scratches on hands.  The DPP and Judge mistakenly used the Doctors reading of the Paramedics medical notes as if they were the Doctors own notes.  The Doctor explicitly testified that she saw no swelling no bruise. My statement that I thought I had been punched was taken at approx am the next day by IO Ishmail.  Its on record long before there were any VCH charges mentioned by anyone. You can choose not to believe the MD if you want but thats a judgement of his credibility and not a fact.  I have no relationship with that Doctor.  He wasnt paid to testify.  We threatened to subpoena him and force him to come. No if my story is believed or not believed has nothing to do with the facts of the case.  Him punching me doesnt prove I didnt punch him. Me saying I didnt punch him doesnt prove I didnt punch him.  The COurt should be making a decision based on the facts but theyve cherry picked evidence to support one party and impugn the other.  Things like ascribing a bruise on the left knee to a car door being slammed on the right.  Or using the MDs explanation of the Paramedics notes as if they were the MDs notes.  Thats bad law. Maybe they were innocent misunderstandings of the facts of the case or maybe like so many people here they were looking I mean the DPP was obviously doing this for reasons to convict and didnt bother to thoroughly examine those reasons.,singapore,d0425d5,0,t5_2qh8c

6800837,0,t3_48wetk,Angmo with Singaporean wife here so we use SG hotels rather often.Hotels are such a personal thing  it depends so much on what you like in a hotel.If you like central Orchard and luxurious Royal Plaza on Scotts often has some great deals at around S. For something a little more boutique Hotel Vagabond looks good. Finally ParkRoyal on Beach Road has very nice rooms and a great poolspa area.My favourite hotel in Singapore by far is the ShangriLa but its more like S. If your budget can stretch you wont be disappointed its where we got married.For food nice options with good food and stylish atmosphere include Min Jiang at Goodwood Park possibly slightly above budget. Imperial Treasure either at Paragon or at MBS are both very good. Paragon location can get noisy though. For something a bit different High Tea at the Rose Veranda at ShangriLa is roughly in budget and gives you plenty of time to relax together.Enjoy your special day ,singapore,d0n61zd,5,t5_2qh8c

His complaining of work may refer to general Singaporeans as in LWLs article or his status as a journalist. But in the sports section he probably only sees the action. LWLs article mentions ST coverage as a catalyst for her thoughts but IMO not a focus. In his comment people remembering LKY through social mediaevents etc may have overdone things but their diversion from work wont ruin the country. Following political enemies like Taiwan talk shows and HK uni students would have wrote bad things about Singaporeans if they didnt praise LKY not the MSM. The damning spitting scenario refers to the opposite of the remembrance going on to create a contrast that tells LWL to be glad.This assistant sports editor notice the two words that diminish his position? Is  years through the beat to reach his position below average performance? banged out a barely readable FB post in  minutes. LWL is probably a polarising figure for reporters due to her sparse documentary writing that seems to proclaim itself to be the truth. His  minutes will now result in a shitshow the full extent may go beyond this news cycle.

History is more observation than fact limited by the accuracy of the observer and the personal judgement of the historian.gtsince everyone has their own version of what history is.Very good we agree on something.gtThe question is which version of history prevails? The one that belongs to whoever is in power ie the victors.How exactly do you determined who has prevailed? Whats your time frame? If the Opposition were to defeat the PAP in the next election but lost the subsequent one would Singapores history be different for those  years?How much victory do you need to write history? North Korea has been winning in its own country for decades and yet its history is exposed to the world.Why do you conflate victory with influence? The USA being economicmilitarypolitical victors over the past few decades hasnt given it the ability to rewrite history to make themselves look better. Theyre widely blamed for causing the Middle East destabilisation and they won both Gulf wars.gtTiananmenStrange example. st there was a wealth of eyewitness evidence unprecedented media coverage and the nature of the internetglobalisation meant that material could not be completely censored by the Chinese government. Student leaders even managed to escape to the US to share their experiences. nd the nature of academia encouraged an objective analysis of the events  historians are basically crime scene investigators trying to piece together the chain of events. Ill concede that the western world may have influenced some historians to produce a more negative analysis. But their published work is open to debateattack by fellow historians. rd history survives as long as records survive. You mention the ongoing censorship within China but as long as Chinese citizens continue to discuss online or publish open letters or maintain groups like the Tiananmen Mothers history will survive.Not sure why you hang on to history is written by the victors when your argument is closer to history textbooks are written by selfserving governments,singapore,d1ihk5s,1,t5_2qh8c

Instead we need to follow the rules in order to be kind? Makes no sense. In short it should not be about the seat but about people.

Theyre looking for people who can express thoughts in a clear and structured manner. Theres no expectation to know the intricacies of the law. Its also not a good idea to try and bring up concepts beyond your grasp. The interviewers will latch on to that sort of thing. Being organised in your thoughts is probably the most important part. Signpost your points. Have a clear stance on things and back up your opinions with a few lines of elaboration.  Take the time you need to think through the issues discussed. Be willing to entertain both sides of an issue even if you personally disagree with one of them. Be firm in defending your stance when questioned but dont freak out or stubbornly go down with the ship if youre hit with new information. Im also pretty sure that I was never asked about why I wanted to be a lawyer or why I thought Id be a good fit. While theyre questions you need to know the answers to the conversation just never went in that direction. If you can get them to focus on something you can really discuss youll be better off than if they have to resort to cliche questions to fill the air.PM me if you want to talk more about it.

This applies to all course no matter what poly you are from. If you cant maintain a good GPA honestly theres no point in thinking to go into a local U. As for which uni to go there are several places you can seek answers from! First is ECG in NP click here The counsellors in ECG would probably be able to better advise you based on your interest and current industry standards.Next you can also go to the various uni open house in the MarchSept periods. Usually NTU and NUS would have talks in the respective schools thatll introduce the different courses available and what to expect from it. Personal experience is that it would be better to approach the lecturers themselves after the talks to know more especially if you have burning questions!.For overseas uni there is always a UK uni fair every months in Singapore do look out for them. Southampton is usually available in these uni fairs as well as other schools as well. Click here,singapore,d1y10im,2,t5_2qh8c

Uber on the other hand can jack up the price when demand shoots upor whenever they feel like it. If we want competition then let it be fair competition. Allow normal taxis to have flexible surge pricing as well. Why is it that govt should regulate comfort or other taxi bodies pricing schemes but not Ubers?

He refrained from mentioning specifics and was vague without lying to my parents. All the relevant questions were discussed in private. To this day they dont really know what the eval was for or what the appointment did at all.Nothing really special happened in BMT. Unit was another experience altogether. Again my superior was super kind about it. We actually had a frank discussion about a number of... lifestyle choices. The only thing that really mattered were these Refrain from sexual contact with strangers while in service. This is more of an opsec concern since theyre afraid you might be blackmailed into revealing sensitive info. You know how sometimes you see grainy camera footage of amateurs where one party clearly doesnt know its happening? Seriously. Dont play play. Dont hit on unit mates. No hanky panky in the toilets and bunks. Dont do anything that will get you charged  porn voyeurism blah. With a partner use protection. Dont be an idiot.Other than that it was made clear that my personal life was my personal life and so long as I turned in acceptable work theyd stay out of it. Come to think of it the kindness was why I was so tryhard in NS. Hm.Also I was surrounded by some of the smartest and kindest people Ive ever met. Holy shit were they nice. They knew and they never really made a big deal out of it. Some buttstuff jokes. Also they showed me instagrams of cute friends.

The actual code depends on whether you have other problems like depression which is often comorbid with being gay  wonder why s. This means no leadership positionsranks. So yeah.

For a complainant to claim it is new and not in the original staging is at best naivet about how theatre and restagings work and at worst petulance about the sanctity of the precious original staging being broken in such a dastardly manner.gt But more important is its tone. It is farcical with an underlying jeer of homophobia. Thnardier sees himself as exposing the hypocrisy of these upperclass parties  eee look at all this scum here. The line directly prior speaks of a Jew  and as a nominal Gentile Thnardier sees Jews as crooks. When he spots a queer he asks But what can you do? as if having to put up with a despised presence. Obviously all this is ironic because in the story Thnardier behaves the most despicably.gt So to take offence at this kiss and to reduce it badly to simply being a samesex kiss is to neglect the fact that this kiss is a perverse mockery of samesex relations. Thnardier hates this queer the kiss is a cruel one not one of love. The tone of the kiss is exactly what the complainants would approve of but theyve completely missed it because omg two men kissed! Like pigs blinkered by rage all they could see was the physical liponlip which managed to blind them to the context of the kiss and scene itself.gt It also seems to have blinded them to the strongly Christian tenor of the play. Beggars at the Feast takes place in the last  minutes of the show. In other words audience members have already seen the following examples of Christian faith and redemption play outgt Valjean embittered by the outsized verdict of having spent  years in jail for a petty crime  years in jail for stealing a loaf of bread and breaking a window pane and another  years because he tried to escape tries to steal the silver candlesticks from the Bishop he seeks shelter with immediately out of jail. He is caught and brought back to the Bishop but the Bishop lies to the constables and says he willingly gave the silver to Valjean to help him. You must use this precious silver to become an honest man he says I have bought your soul for God. gt Valjean is consumed by guilt and realises this is his chance to live honourably. He breaks parole escapes from being a marked criminal and becomes a business owner. He becomes an upstanding member of society  he gives jobs to people becomes Mayor and tries to right any wrongs he sees such as a man being crushed by a cart and Fantine dying after being sacked from his factory  and dedicates it all to God.gt In fact the entire play can be said to be about Valjeans redemption. He constantly atones for his past raising Cosette as his own daughter risking his own life to be at the barricade to watch over Marius who Cosette loves and literally saves Marius life. He sings most beautifully God on high hear my prayer in my need you have always been there. Let him live let him live...gt Valjeans penitence and humility in the face of his past suffering is contrasted with the arrogance of his nemesis Inspector Javert who is hellbent on bringing Valjean back into jail for breaking parole. Javert is a punishing Christian. He berates Fantine who has resorted to prostitution Honest work. Just reward. Thats the way to please the Lord! Protestant work ethic is clear in this one.gt But Javerts hardline ways are misguided. When he is exposed behind the revolutionary barricade as an undercover agent for the monarchy Valjean steps forward and says he will take care of him. Javert fully expects that Valjean will shoot him  the expected reward for exposed betrayal. It would also be so easy for Valjean to finally shake the shadow that has been hounding him for years. Javerts hands are tied he is at Valjeans mercy. And mercy indeed for Valjean shows compassion forgiveness and understanding as he cuts Javerts bonds and sets him free. Javert consumed with anguished selfdoubt commits suicide in the face of such upstanding honour and mercy. He knows if the positions had been reversed it is not what he would have done and it makes him the lesser man.gt So for the complainants to zoom in on this kiss which was a truly minor illustrative point inconsequential to the broader themes of the play is really missing the forest for the trees  which perhaps speaks truth to the sort of congregation Lawrence Khong leads. They could stand to learn a lesson or two about forgiveness from the play they had just watched.gt Finally the play has a General rating but it also has elaborated portrayals of the followinggt  A chain gang of prisoners working themselves to the bone where its hot as hell belowgt  Prostitutes hustling for customers hungry for a poke standing up or lying down or any way at all  Fantine bleakly sings of a disempowered fate Dont it make a change to have a girl who cant refuse?gt  Blatant child abuse of Cosette by the Thnardiersgt  Thnardier threatening domestic violence on his own daughter Eponine One little scream youll regret it for a year. Youll scream all right!gt  Child soldiers  Gavroche bravely picks his way across the battlefield to pick bullets for the revolutionaries only to be shot by a soldiergt  Graphic death  Enjolras in a last ditch attempt to rally the revolutionaries climbs to the top of the barricade to wave their flag high. He is shot  he tumbles  he falls. The revolving stage turns to show him draped dramatically down the barricade his feet hooked in some holdfast. His limp body lies strewn and almost flippantly discarded his red jerkin a symbolic smearing of his wasted blood and youth across the doomed revolution.gt So I suppose young people can be exposed to all this death sex war and the realities of life but not to a samesex kiss which was in the first place enacted in the very castigation of homosexuality that the complainants surely approve of.gt Thanks to MDAs intervention that kiss has since been replaced by a long hug.Hat tip Gwyneth Teo,singapore,d46i3e1,45,t5_2qh8c

Itll be nice to have a discussion that doesnt devolve to namecalling and anger amp tears.Homophobia does seem to draw strength from strong religious and moral convictions  i.e. its wrong because my religion says so and its not right for man to sleep with man. Personally I feel Asian conservatism is also a large contributor. I mean were barely beginning to accept single mothers into the fold as socially acceptable.. and  years ago divorces were scandalous events.I agree government laws such as A set the OB markers for general society. However as evidenced by the lack of enforcement I think that in this case A is there more for the peace of mind of the populace rather than as an imposition by the government. Putting it short The general population is not interested in supporting gay rights and the gahmen has no interest in forcing the issue either. However theres no way to move forward by prorights ppl having a discussion all by ourselves.  The people who oppose need to be engaged and we need to have a conversation to address all sides.

You might be right it could explain the spirits that lingers.Although a few question still remains This djinn Qarin is your doppleganger djinn and it will continue to live on while you have died but how come it associates its reason for haunting as the original body do?I mean lets say you see the bedok reervoir lady spirits haunting around and if you managed to catch them and question it it will say perhaps to seek rest through proper burial or send off.If that was the djinn QarinWhy would the Djinn Qarin do that? Thier main and only purpose is only to make you sin and once you dead they dont give a eff what happen.Secondly there is this problem on uniformity  the standard attire of known ghost lets say the famous one the pontianak kuntilanak cik pon fatima rockers or whatever.. see the problem is.. they have a standard looking appearance white with long black hair.. even in most cultures they look the same.The funny thing is if you see  of them together they look exactly alike. This one doesnt really explain if its a Qarin or not because if its supposed to be your mirror image why change to standard looking uniform upon death?So yeah its hard to determine what is ghost and what is spirits all i know is... dont wanna see them dont wanna hear them or whatever cause they creepy.,singapore,d4hs765,1,t5_2qh8c

Does anyone know if I can get a longer power cord for the CPU? The one supplied is too short and is rather taut when plugged in dont want to strain the cable and risk damage. Ive checked the cable as long as I get a cable with the same current and voltage ratings should be fine right? Anyone experienced enough to weigh in?Also do HDMI cables have any difference? From what I can tell they all have the same performance regardless of price tag. Its just useless addons like goldplating or gasinjected cables Whatever that is that do nothing to improve signal quality or cable lifespan relative to price. If so just a shitty  dollar HDMI cable would do right? Or should I just stick with my VGA cable?Edit Okay lessons learnt. Research parts before buying use liquid cooling if overclocking and go with my gut feeling of getting a SSD instead of worrying about space next time.

The western books and people always suggest asking others about themselves because everyone loves to talk about themselves. But i find this to be generally untrue with singaporeans. Most will get a bit suspicious if you ask too much about them. The way to slant it to them without seeming too intrusive would be to ask about their opinion on neutral topics think Brexit weather missing planes anything making headlines then go in from there to smth a bit more personal  have you ever been to the uk in the rain on a plane in the newspaper,singapore,d4tahpc,9,t5_2qh8c

Im not a great sketcher as of yet but I can learn. Storytelling skills to be able to sell the product? I think itd probably be more enriching to learn problem solving skills.

8677947,0,t1_d6qcu8x,In the US we can and do farm out engineering work overseas.  Its not our first goto though because the quality usually sucks not always because the workers suck but also because of language and time zone barriers.We also import foreign workers but the pay stays high because of the HB law requiring that petitions for hire are preferentially given to citizens and permanent residents first and then to foreign HB applicants.  Theyre then required to pay market rate theoretically removing incentives to bring foreign workers unnecessarily.  In practice the system is poorly regulated and they usually get paid less than Americans anyway but there are enough problems posed to keep pay and demand for Americans high.Im curious what do you think is different about the Singapore foreign worker scheme that seems to keep pay in finance high but engineering very low?  There should be just as big a supply of foreign finance intellectuals as there are of engineers.  Maybe its because of corruption issues?,singapore,d6qd83q,6,t5_2qh8c

8703436,0,t3_4z67v3,I did public speaking in JC so O might be ablw to help you a little for oral.For the passage reading part if its still there after youve read through it once dont dive straight into trying to read it aloud. try to visualize what a perfect reading would look like to you BEFORE you start reading aloud. Do a few passages before your actual oral to see how it works out for you.As for the picture discussion im p sure it still exists in some form try to turn it into a casual conversation rather than some structured BS. Talk about something you read related to the topic at hand and try to guide the conversation as if youre having a casual chat with the invigilators. For my year I managed to drag a discussion on CIP into a discussion about the street children of vietnam and am still proud of that.Also Im not sure if youre the kind who gets nervous easily but if you are once its nearing your turn about  minutes beforehand STOP rehearsing whatever BS you brought in. If you have someone who you can casually chat with do that. If not close your eyes and mediate or something. Nervousness WILL show in your performance and its not going to be pretty for a major exam like this. I always found that last minute revision amplifies any insecurities I had.

Tys is really your best friend. What i did after doing tys was to flip thru the mcq ans key and mark myself as much as i cant without looking at the correct answer so i can attempt the qn agn. After that take a good look at the qns and see where u did wrong.. Dont study the whole syllabus blindly and overwork yourself. More like a repeat for point  take extra note of the CHAPTERS that you are weak in for a particular subject and then focus on those weaker chapters. There are bound to be chapters you are strong and weak in a particular subject. Do more qns on the weaker chapters and memorise key concepts and find patterns in O level qns.

Some people have no issues with it while some cant seem to get away from issues when using ezbuy services.You should have less trouble if you use their ezbuy or Prime service i.e. purchase directly from their website or app. Thats the most straightforward method of purchasing items on ezbuy you add the item you want to your shopping cart check out they show you all the charges and all available modes of shipping for you to select and theyll take care of the rest.Their BuyForMe service is a bit more complicated if youre not used to thirdparty buyers you have two separate payments first payment is for the item itself and the second is for shipping and agent fees their shipping fees are charged by volumetric weight so unless you know the dimensions of the packaging you may be in for a surprise when they release the shipping fees they also have a lot of shipping restrictions so they may end up saying soandso can only be shipped by sea instead of air delaying your shipment their inspection coverage is also very limited so you never know if youll get what you want.They always have promotions every week like free agent fees  off shipping etc. so look out for those.

One of my favourite aspects of Singapore. Trees and vegetation soothes something in the human psyche and provides some respite from the pressures of modern city life.

On the other hand what would they know of making wise decisions  theyre the same age as you! Another one. You think adults would know the wiser choice but then again you think that they wont be able to understand you enough to make a wise choice.And youre twisting my words.

First they will set up several depts who need to be paid then will have to issue blanket welfare requirements meaning people will find ways to abuse them. And of course your tax will increase money doesnt come out of nowhere.. Govt being responsible means that people will feel less responsible for the needy. Taking care of the needy should be the job of family friends neighbours religious organisations then charities. It is more personal this way and if the needy suffers then it is YOUR FAULT.

9108699,0,t1_d86oz7r,No the immigration worsens things because you have more adults who are going to grow old too. The fundamental problem is the very low TFR. Trying to mitigate the very low TFR with immigration doesnt address the problem because the immigrants will also have a very low TFR like the nativeborns. So unless you are okay with an exponentially growing population which is physically impossible with Singapores limited land capacity immigration does not work in the long or even medium term because it does not address the structural problem underlying the subreplacement TFR. The mathematics simply doesnt work.Im not sure why my own personal family history is relevant to the discussion. My father came to Singapore in the s as an expatriate way before the flood gates were open and only settled here after getting married to my mother who is a local. Immigration via marriage has always been a policy of Singapore and countries around the world. Giving away PRs and citizenship cheaply en masse to people unrelated to the existing population is not. I certainly welcome a sensible immigration policy where immigrants are sponsored by relatives. Like in the rest of the world.gt Im not sure why you arbitrarily picked  years as the magic number.  was the year roughly when large scale immigration to Singapore began. We started with . million in  and ended with . million in  at a rate far greater than what was possible with replacementlevel TFRs.,singapore,d86pvsv,0,t5_2qh8c

The Global Times articles are seen by me as outbursts by some branches of the Party who a want to stoke nationalist rage to distract the public from their economic problems b already stoked some nationalist rage previously and cannot afford to strike a conciliatory tone towards Singapore. Singapore is not the sole victim of the outbursts from Global Times anyway and while it is not an entirely uncredible source since it serves as the Partys English language mouthpiece the newspaper is sort of used as a mechanism for the Party to vent to the outside world.After all Singapore is probably the only country in Southeast Asia which may have any kind of sympathetic sentiment towards China. Cambodia and Laos may be in Chinas pocket now but both countries are showing increasing levels of discontent at being Chinas puppet states.

My teacher used to drill us such that we didnt even have to refer to the MF for the cosine rule. When you approach a question especially geometry amp trigo related remember draw diagrams to help you understand and visualise things. Then label dissect them.Remember questions on constructing of arcs circles triangles etc. ? Dont purely just memorise the steps to doing. But do analyse every arc and intersection of arc you draw how does it give you your desired length?I would say memorising works very well for Chemistry and Biology esp. Biology where you just regurgitate your notes. Since you are doing combined if you have Physics you will have to understand things. But memorising with understanding is key. Pure memorisation without knowing how to apply wont help.If you happen to be taking AMaths a noticeable trait you will find is that students are able to score a better grade in AMath than EMath.Because EMath is too competitive. My teacher who is brilliant. His students mostly never got below an A in ALevels based on past records highlights because EMath paper are set for students to be able to earn marks it caused the Belle Curve to shift to the extent to get an A is around  marks. A typical  would probably net a B. Meanwhile they are able to secure a better grade in AMath because it differentiates between the better students Most schools set their prelim papers my school is infamous for having much tedious and harder Math papers to be tougher than Cambridge standard. So normally students who dont do so good in Math will find themselves getting better grades than they expect due to normalisation of the belle curve.Most importantly work hard give the best you got. The rest will be up to Cambridge.,singapore,d8i65tl,1,t5_2qh8c

My friend has several very visible tattoos along with those enlarged ear piercings  not sure what they are called and is working as a childcare teacher where both the kids AND parents love her. My cousin has a giant lizard tattoo on her back shoulder shes also a teacher.If you are really THAT worried just use a tattoo cover up. Whether youre a guy or girl just head into Sephora and ask for advice on how to do so. Tip you can use an orange concealer followed by full coverage foundation that matches your skin.

What Im saying is that having them clear tables is not a cost effective solution compared to robots. I have no idea how you managed to misconstrue that.gtYou are making some pretty big assumptions  which has already been shown not to be true especially for the tray return robots.Yes Im assuming that these return robots are effective at doing their jobs. Thats the premise of the argument.gtIf two people can do the same job do you hire one and give the other free money? Why would anyone let alone a profit oriented company do that? Of course you wouldnt but in this case by not having robots youre effectively forcing a business to hire someone instead.gtRemember Singapores claim to fame is the ease of doing business. Levying an old workers retirement tax on business isnt going to go down well.Levying an old workers retirement tax on business is already what youre doing by preventing automated robots from existing. Its the same thing youre making businesses spend more money by taking away other more cost effective options.,singapore,d9f8uzp,2,t5_2qh8c

I think it has been made complicated so that only those who are persistent enough are able to use it.Why cant WirelessSG provide a permanent password for  days by allowing a person to provide his passport copy either at airport or any other place?There is definitely scope to make it better.

Examples include quotes simple shapes simple linework etc. Just see which one you prefer based on their other work and which one you feel comfortable talking to. No point your artist can tattoo until it looks exactly like the photo and can move like d but throughout the whole process you feel uncomfortable with the person. As long as you are okay with the artist and they can do decent work it should be fine.Unless youre going for custom pieces or something then I would think you really need to worry about artists style.  ,singapore,da6zows,1,t5_2qh8c

One of my blonde friends not making fun of blonde angmoh girls but my friend was like the stereotypical blonde air headed bimbo type told him You can press the soap machine and take yourself. He smiles at her and asks her to pass him some. Her being dumb af pumped some soap into her palm and pours it into his hands. Thats when she notices that he has his dick in his other hand and was wanking off. They all notices it at the same time screams and takes off running into a nearby LAN shop where a few ah bengs decide to help them out and hunt for the guy. Never found him.. I worked in a kitchen as part of my internship and had some ungodly hours to clock. One night i took the last  bus home. If you know  youd know the passengers. Theyre mostly Bangladeshi construction workers. It was a Sunday night and the entire bus was packed with construction workers. Not to be mean or anything i am pretty tight with some construction workers around my housing area and regularly talk to them. Most of them are hardworking and nice but then theres the  that just ruins everything. Pretty sure all  of the bad apples were in that bus that night. I had no seat and was squashed up in a corner. I felt a hand grazing my butt everytime the bus jerked. Decided to give the guy the benefit of the doubt maybe it was an accident. But when the bus hit a stop light and i found a hand on my ass.. Oh boy. That aint no accident. I turned around and glared into his eyes. Pretty sure i shot lasers that night. He got the message and left me alone. But i had another thing to survive  getting out of the bus. My stop was coming up next after a hellish hour on that bus. I was really far from the exit and had to squeeze through everyone. I was like....the only girl on that bus. And i could not count how many hands were on my body as i tried to exit. It was the scariest and most disgusting thing i ever felt in my life. I went home to scrub myself after that. None of them were accidents. I looked into their faces as i exited and as i said excuse me and they were LAUGHING and smiling at me as they groped me. FYOU . As i mentioned earlier i worked in the kitchen for my internship. It was my first day at work. I was sent by my chef to another department to get some ingredients. If youve ever been behind the scenes of a hotel youd be in awe of the belly of the building that no guests ever see. Its a maze. I was finding my way to my destination when i was stopped by a chef in mid s or early s. I was warned beforehand by my seniors that life in the kitchen is a real downer and most chefs date other chefs. And most male chefs see rookies females as fair game. I was fresh meat in this place. I like to think of myself as pretty confident and strong i dont intimidate easily. But i was alone in the kitchen with this guy who was looking at me like i was prime steak. As he led me to the fridge and started getting my stuff he said Would you like to come to my place? I shot back I dont even know you why would i go to your house? He replied We can get to know each other there. and then he puts his hands on my shoulders and squeezed me. I was like My chef is expecting me. Bye.  and almost ran out of there. Having said that i had a lot of fun on my internship. Im sure not all chefs are as humsup as he was but theres always one in every kitchen. Confirm.,singapore,da86k9n,3,t5_2qh8c

9712887,0,t1_daa041x,gt Intellectual property and patents for medicine. Read the intellectual property section  Nothing states that it will extend the data exclusivity period just streamlining to comply with various international bodies for IP laws.Are you sure you want to play read the XYX section? OK. I refer you to Article . Biologics. You will find that data exclusivity is required for either  years or  years and other measures to provide the same result. Singapore and Australia both have five years and now have to provide eight years. The will delay the acceptance of biosimilar drugs thus putting pressure on the cost of drugs. When you refer to streamlining to comply with various international bodies for IP laws most IP laws are covered by TRIPS. The TPP extends many of those protections way beyond the requirements of TRIPS. I dont know why you refer to ratcheting up IP protections for the benefit of US corporations as streamlining. gt Not really concern on whats happening in US. US would most likely not join TPP under Trump but well see. IP laws are almost nonexistent in SEA region and this will just protect heavy RampD from blatant copying.Oh TRIPS if enforced doesnt do that? The entire purpose of increased copyright protection Singapore fell for this a while ago is to protect big US studios. Youre familiar with the socalled Mickey Mouse Act? Michael Froman pointed to films such as Sound of Music and Dr. Zhivago noting that these films are  vintage which without TPP will be off protection next year. Variety Magazine quoting Michael Froman May . Why does Singapore care that Sound of Music has longer copyright protection? And despite the US having reasonable fair use copyright provisions why does the TPP not include them to their fullest extent? How does any of this help Singapore? ,singapore,daabn3r,1,t5_2qh8c

UltraHD Blu Ray physical media is selling faster than Blu Ray did in  K streaming is also limited by bandwidth requirements of mbit at least and will take up GB over an hour This is nothing to us in Singapore but it matters a great deal to a vast chunk of consumers in Australia who have shitty bandwidth caps and plenty in the US market where gbit is unaffordable compared to what we have. The fact that PS Pro doesnt have UHD Blu Ray support has been a dealbreaker for a lot of K TV owners and theyre moving to this Xbone S instead.

9899317,0,t1_daxpffd,Im really just curious okay so dont get all in a hissy. But based on your position of strong deterrence and no foothold and all that would you advocate the death penalty for gamblers? I mean you know in Imperial China when opium addiction was rife rich families would get their useless offspring addicted to opium rather than gambling. Why? How much opium can one smoke? The upper limit is overdose and death. But the upper limit for gambling is literally destruction of the entire clan and family. Would you advocate making gambling illegal and death for gamblers?

9931470,0,t1_db1rqv8,There are basically three things that the government can have regarding money only theyre limited to two at a time. Capital movement currency trading forex rate control and monetary policy control inflationinterest. Trying to have all three simply doesnt work as pegging forex and interest will result in massive currency movement until the central bank loses the ability to enforce the forex rate.Singapore has gone with free capital and limited control over forex rates through a set of pegs the SNEER in order to get limited control over inflation. Why not directly control interest rates to control inflation the way countries like the US and Britain do? The trouble there is interest rate changes only affect loans being made in the local currency. A huge amount of the business being done in Singapore is being done in foreign currency cargo trading for example or prices are set using foreign currency local branch of a US company for instance sets its prices in USD so they periodically change the price in SGD. Controlling the local loan rates wont affect those. So partial control of the forex rates has been determined to control local inflation better than setting the interest rate.Basically local interest rates are low because forex traders expect the SGD to continue on its trend of gradual appreciation.

9989182,0,t1_db9leke,To answer your question yes I do. But I should have made myself clearer a terrestrial artificial fusion reaction would rarely ever run away. Novae and supernovae occur due to uncontrollable initial conditions in the first place including immense pressures temperatures and a continuous large inflowpresence of fuel for the reaction to cannibalise on and subsequently run away. None of these conditions would be remotely reproducible on Earth on a large scale. If anything did go wronglike the cooling system breaking downand if it were left unchecked a fusion reactor would burn itself out like a candle. Furthermore supernovae are relatively rarewhich just enhances my point further that in turn runaway fusion reactions are rare.The differences between fusion and fission reactors once again contextualising this to terrestrial artificial reactors not natural ones like stars are the environment in the reactors amount of fuel present and of course the reaction itself. In a fission reactor the typical temperature is not significantly more than that reached by blast furnacessome several thousand Kelvins. In fusion reactors the temperature has to reach the millions of Kelvins for the usual deuteriumtritium reaction hoped to be achieved by ITER or the hundreds of millions of Kelvin in certain cleaner reactions like protiumboron that dont generate fast neutrons unlike the former. This temperature has to be generated externally by another source whether artificial or natural which is why achieving power breakeven with fusion is taking so long. This is the same case for the pressure in the fusion reactor which is in the dozens of petapascalsthats a one with fifteen zeroes after whereas fission reactors dont even need an ambient pressure to work.Next in fission reactors the fuel is well in excess to keep the reaction going with carbon rods inserted into the reactor pile to control the rate of reaction. The thing with fission is that once you get a large enough mass which isnt actually very large of fissile material together it will spontaneously react and continue reacting since the fission products themselves cause a chain reaction. This doesnt happen with fusion. Just because you have a huge nebulasized pile of hydrogen gas doesnt mean itll spontaneously burst alight and fuse. You need to give it a resultant angular momentum a nudge and some gravitational potential energy that can be converted to kinetic and then thermal energy to kickstart the whole thing. And even then you only get a steady nuclear reaction not a runaway one.Finally fission reactions are usually chain reactions on a downward slope and theyre spontaneous aided by the reaction products. A U nucleus splits into an alpha particle and a Th nucleus which is itself fissile of its own accord. A stray alpha or beta particle from another splitting U or any other nuclide nucleus banging into this first one will only serve to accelerate the reaction. On the other hand four protium nuclei can fuse into one helium nucleus only because they have enough energy to overcome the repulsive electrostatic forces and get close enough that the strong nuclear force can pull everything together. The gamma rays and fast neutrons generated by fusion reactions cant do jack to increase the rate of reaction.The mechanism between the two is entirely different and this energy is usually not intrinsic. They have to get it from their thermal energy or the pressure or both. TLDR runaway fusion reactions are still rare.,singapore,db9m96s,5,t5_2qh8c

Those PRC students are mostly in science and engineering where maths is language and not English. Besides giving scholarship to foreigners to study engineering is actually better for Singapore. We are short of engineers those foreigners will actually become an engineer and work here while local engineering graduates go selling house  insurance or some general admin duties.About management position going to foreigners. If they arent capable they will be gone soon. Thats especially true in current economic conditions. Of course he knew that thats why he is criticizing their origin and not their capabilities.

Most of the newer arrivals do feel shortchanged but are unable to quit the job due to debts incurred to get here in the first place.And there will be those complaining there are cheaper foreigners coming here to steal their job.

10100626,0,t3_5kh53v,UB is a great school the population is  undergrad and  post grad. It doesnt feel as big as you would think. I know Singapore is large and NTU is a big school but for me my high school was oboe  kids so it was large jump in student population. That being said it didnt feel too big.Its a good idea to make friends early because its easy to fall into a routine of not hanging out with anyone. That was a problem I made my first semester. Its big enough to feel lonely if you dont find a group of friends.The school itself has a lot to offer for its students. Tons of clubs and free activities you should take advantage of if your have the chance.UB is about a  hour car ride from NYC so pretty far. Public transportation isnt as great or cheap as Singapore too so traveling can be difficult if you dont have a car. The school has two campuses South and North. North is in the suburbs of the city of Buffalo and the south campus is more towards the city but not in the downtown area. Also post election I havent noticed any hostility from trump supporters at all which is good. Its a fairly liberal campus I was devastated with the results of the election. We have a large population of foreign students and a diverse population even though the majority are white suburban students. The state of NY is more liberal than other states so thats a plus. I just hope dictator Trump doesnt cause too much harm. On campus study abroad there I doubt youll be affected.,singapore,dbo4idx,8,t5_2qh8c

10177694,0,t3_5lq50a,Wow first off  major props to you for supporting your friend through this. Depression is a very real issue and I respect you for dedicating your time to help her. Youve given her valid advice but the challenge is in how receptive your friend will be to any sort of advice for now given her mental state. gt she seems to dislike social interaction and see no point in communicating with other humans except me and her familyIm no psychiatrist but these are some things you might want to do in the meantime. Try asking her out often to engage in activities that will incorporate some sort of social interaction. Get her outdoors get any sort of exercise before she gets too consumed in a downward spiral of negative thoughts. The more she remains indoors the more withdrawn your friend would eventually become and it will be harder for you.As to seeking help given her current financial conditions there are several counselling hotlines to start off with. Introduce her to the idea of speaking to someone without making it seem like she has issues without being too forceful.Im not exactly answering directly to your questions now but please feel free to PM me if you need additional support to help your friend out over the next few months and Ill be happy to help. ,singapore,dbxp4ps,12,t5_2qh8c

My future seems so bleak compared to my peers and Im already  year behind. The course that Im applying for in poly is one that Ive been looking forward to all year in JC I already knew that I couldnt make it from the start but now Im not sure whether its the right fit business since its not exactly what I want to do in life but Im not interested in any other thing. Im envious of people who know what they want to do in life and are working towards it because I really dont have any idea what Im going to be doing next time.Sometimes I think Im too afraid to step out of my comfort zone too afraid to explore the unknown... But were in Singapore how can right? Was talking to a friends dad at a gathering and he reiterated what all adults have been telling me  that interests arent important getting a job that can earn you a living is more important what youre studying now might not be what youre doing in the future. Going by this logic why should I be studying then? At a crossroad now. Dont know whether Ill be able to adjust in poly whether Ill do as well as everyone says  that poly students who came from JC will top the class etc very easy to catch up on because JC was so fast paced. Yet I wasnt doing well in JC either so I dont think thatll apply to me My family situation isnt the best right now too feeling really unhappy being home all the time and my parents were so happy when they found out I was looking for a job.

10421340,0,t1_dcnn2m7,gtIm tired so Ill keep it short. Like Ive said from the start to even remotely encourage your child to take a different track from the mainstream education route requires a certain level of financial freedom for which most middle class Singaporean cannot afford to do.What is the mainstream? Going to university? Poly? ITE? Is doing an art and design course in poly considered mainstream? Or are you only considering businessSTEM majors as mainstream? I know people who attended the sports school and did pretty well having a decent degree and job now so Im not sure if you call these people mainstream or not. They are also firmly middle class living in  room flats. If you take liberal arts courses you can always find work as a teacher. It sucks but it pays the bills. gtStrongly believe that until a child is able to decide for themselves it is your job as a parent to guide and nurture them in a way that sets them up to beat the system. Unless you have the means to ensure their success in alternative means of education.My job as a parent is to nurture my kids to think for themselves and take ownership of their actions. Not tell them what I or society thinks they need to do. If they choose a hard path in life then thats their choice. Their life not mine.

Whats your risk level? How much liquidity do you require? All these factors will limit your choices.FYI if youre just looking for higher interest rates for your savings you can actually Google it since there are many articles that compare most of the banks savings plans. I believe CIMB has the highest interest rates but I think Frank by OCBC also offers a higher interest rate for young savers with more flexibility.,singapore,dd7xofo,2,t5_2qh8c

10604272,0,t1_dd9i5e4,gt If such a thing was known peoples spending habits could be tracked not to mention it would be easier to commit bank fraud. It is not necessary for sending money imho.Erm how? Its just a number that a bank gives you for people to deposit number to. Think of it like an address for people to send their letters and postcards to. Its harmless to give out your address to people if you just want to receive mails. Its also like a phone number. If you want others to call you you tell them your phone number.gt peoples spending habits could be trackedTheres no way to track someones spending habits just by a bank account number. The bank doesnt just disclose that kind of information to anyone that has a number. Its as ridiculous as going to SingTel to request for a persons call history simply because I have the phone number. Any sane bank would require you to prove that you own that account before they will reveal that kind of information.,singapore,dd9r08l,0,t5_2qh8c

Im heading there  Feb   March and I have no clue how to pack as this is my fist time going to a country in winter! Bazhang with gloves and face mask all or just a good coat will do?. Based on your visit what would you say are some of the overratedunderrated spots of Tokyo?. I understand that its pretty difficult to find bad food in Tokyo but are there any affordable  SGD restaurantscafes that I have to try and visit?.

Of course nowadays it is not much of an ethnic enclave in Singapore  though I do think quite a few mainland Chinese live there in comparison to elsewhere.Far flung for Singapore is still very close for US standards though!

10774343,0,t1_ddknccd,Thanks for the detailed reply!I used to be involved in Chingay logscrowd control back in the good old days when it was an actual street parade which is why I asked.I went down on Friday  you were quite right theres only a small m stretch along the back of the Singapore Flyer thats free and people can stand along the railings as the performers exit.To be fair the Chingay performers did perform for the free audience instead of just walking past they stop along the stretch and do their dance routines or performances. So I guess they perform once for the main ticket holders then turn the corner and perform once more for the free audience. Of course the free portion had no fireworks or pyrotechnics like the paid portion did.Intended to go back home and watch the live telecast on Saturday... only to find out that they stopped doing live telecast this year. Only got delayed telecast on the th or something. Sigh.Good to know that Chingay has morphed into just another paidfor performance I guess. It was interesting to see the new format but I think this will be my last year watching Chignay.Thanks!,singapore,ddrano0,2,t5_2qh8c

Singapore is an extremely urbanised country. All we really need is to start passing out rifles and ammo to basically everyone and any army invading would have most of their soldiers shot in the back.And no bombing the city areas only creates rubble which can make it even worse for the invaders as now you have a whole lot more unlikely angles which you can be shot from. Its been tried in WW in places like Stalingrad and really it doesnt help that much.

10794088,0,t3_5udhj7,Sexed in Singapore is seriously insufficient. It focuses on abstinencebased donthavesexuntilmarriage headlines and doesnt cover enough contraceptive measures.But its kind of understandable. Sex ed  is mostly compulsory for all studentsand Singaporeans are from a lot of different religions some of which highly value chastity and are against contraceptives. The government is is most afraid of parents complaining that the education system is teaching them bad things to go have sex and afraid of offending religious groups. Also of course Singapore is infamous for its political neutrality so its understandable why they would choose to omit controversial information than to force people to be more open minded.Actually if you go to the Health Promotion Boad website and research about sexual health and contraceptives the information there is actually very comprehensive and unbiased. This is probably because theyre not accountable if you visit the site by your own choice but MOE will have to face the wrath of all the parents if they put anything controversial into the sex ed syllabus.,singapore,ddtc0p2,53,t5_2qh8c

However Ill note that my B is in GP whereas your brother got a U which is not very good news to universities Id imagine because it could be an indicator of how well he writes but this can be mitigated depending on what subjects he actually chose. Im now in my final year of uni in London. I did a year of foundation before commencing my undergrad. Im benefiting from studying overseas because . I did science in A levels Im definitely not cut out for science and . I need space and independence I cannot have naggingpressure from my parents mostly my mum really.So questions  What does your brother want to do? Why did he do so badly unsuitable subject combination external factors school was not a good time for him is he just not cut out for studying? Does he actually want to retake his A levels because this needs A LOT of discipline. Whats the relationship with his parents like  this will affect whether studying in local private university is the way to go because if hes anything like me unable to deal with nagging then hes not going to excel in private university too. The best option to take would obviously be the one thats most suited for your brother. Ill be happy to answer any questions about studying in the UK. ,singapore,de5rhi2,2,t5_2qh8c

Im not going to pretend that Im the most generous person out there cause Im not and whether I show my gratitude to a busker part with a nominal sum for tissues really depends on a day to day feel. But two days ago after reaching farrer Park omw to mustafa there was this uncle on a wheelchair. Idk whether he was licensed or not but I doubt he was. He would ask everyone that walks past him to help him out with his tissues and when you dont like me he would start shouting how disrespectful you are how you were brought up badly how selfish you are to not be able to part with a nominal sum. Any thoughts of helping the fella out was instantly thrown out of my head. Worst is he would come up to you on his wheelchair and Ive seen instances of him grabbing peoples arm and body when they walk away.

11176300,0,t1_dexc374,uHidingCatThanks for you well wishes. Honestly I dont know if Ill ever be capable of loving myself and this terrifies me more than anything else. I can try working towards reducing the hatred I have for myself but selflove is a goal that is really farfetched for me at this point in time.utempestgt Youre obviously craving something more than what most men who visit escorts do.I am yes. Its not all about sex for me which is what men who visit escorts presumably desire most. At this point in my life all I desire for is a loving and intimate relationship with someone who loves me as much as I love her. But I dont think Ill never know what its like to feel truly genuinely wanted and desired by another person.umarum gt Also why did you feel that this was the only way to experience sex? Do you have big self confidence issues?I do. I didnt think I would ever be able to have an intimate relationship with someone and these thoughts still do tortuously run through my head. If no one even wants or desires me as a friend what hope is there of me finding a partner in the future wholl want and desire me to be with them  let alone the foreseeable future? According to my psychologist I have a very low selfesteem although if you were to ask me Id say my selfesteem is largely absent. And my selfimage is really poor as well.umilnivekgt Since you havent had sex before or after that experience have you considered the fact that you might be putting sex on a pedestal?I have considered this many times. Honestly I wouldnt know what else to think about this subject either given my limited experience with it and lack of experience in intimate relationships.gt any revulsionregret you have is due to the conditioning of societyIt might be so but I also feel like a complete worthless loser in that I have to resort to paying for sex instead of having it in the context of an intimate relationship like almost everyone else seemingly does which is what I desire  and sometimes even feel like I need  the most.uWANGBADAN gt theres something limiting and constrained about your worldview. Identifying the bottleneck and opening it up will provide you with some relief.I think I get where youre coming from but Im not sure I completely understand your meaning here.

Some were confused and many were in disbelief.gt gt A group of students who had burst their budget while planning for an outing ended up not spending a cent at the supermarket. Another initially rejected the notion of having his groceries paid for.gt gt Its a very rare situation said the surprised shopper.gt gt But it was one couples reaction that caught the attention of many  the man initially asked with skepticism why Mike Kasem would offer to cover his bill. He eventually relented.gt gt Its the first time in my whole life that people paid for my familys groceries he said tears welling up in his eyes.gt gt The video has chalked up nearly  shares and a more than a quarter of a million views on Facebook.gt gt The team from the music station  comprising Kasem Vernetta Lopez Jamie Yeo Mr X and Denise Tan  began brainstorming in January when they were reflecting on what Gold is as a radio station and how to stay true to its tagline Sounds good feels good.gt gt How do we sincerely make people feel good? How can we spread those good feelings in a truly meaningful way? the deejays asked said Tan.gt gt They came across a video by nonprofit initiative Fill My Basket based in Oklahoma City in the United States that helps complete strangers with their grocery bills. That was what kickstarted the entire idea Tan said.gt gt But when it came to the crunch the Gold team was really nervous starting out.gt gt My heart was pounding every single time I slipped behind someone in the queue. Because no persons reaction is the same! she told Channel NewsAsia. The actual paying itself is also a bit of a thrill and extremely rewarding when you know youre just showing someone that they deserve a kind gesture they deserve to get a treat they deserve a lucky break that a stranger can care for you and share a little kindness.gt gt You just have to be brave and have a heart she added. Making someones day doesnt have to be an enormous expensive grand gesture.gt gt While many of the grocery bills did not cost a lot the recipients reactions were exponentially greater than the sum of their receipts Tan said. That was the ultimate but unexpected reward.gt gt The Gold team was also encouraged by the recipients willingness to pay it forward. They received many stories inspired by their video  one person made a donation to a hospital another woman decided to buy packets of food for the needy and two sisters who were buying groceries for a family steamboat meal asked the deejays if they could do something in return after getting their grocery bill covered.gt gt They stayed true to their word! Tan said. We got an email saying they made a donation to a charity that distributes food to the less fortunate.gt gt Now thats what makes our effort all the more meaningful and heartwarming  when one little idea and action gains momentum and that good intention grows and spreads and touches more and more people. We certainly hope this will be the first of many more chances for us to get together as a team to do good things for our community Tan said.gt gt  CNAdlThis bot was created by uLFlare being too poor to afford ST subscription fees.Feedback GitHub,singapore,dfbuiiz,2,t5_2qh8c

11378167,1,t1_dfllhul,gt See but youre framing it from the accused not the accuser.gt Since you want to play hypotheticals lets do this. Say you go to the police and tell them youve been robbed. Do you now become an alleged robbery victim? If you say youve been assaulted are you an alleged assault victim?I can say Im a robberyassault victim which also places me at the risk of getting a civil suit of defamation or the criminal charge of making a false police report if it turns out I lied about it. But as far as the media is concerned Im an alleged victim because its not the place of the media to determine whos innocent and whos guilty.gt Now you might say that X alleges Y assaulted them. But we rarely use language that suggests the assault itself is in question.Whos this we and whats this rarely. Just do a quick Google of assault reports on the Straits Times.A grey Honda allegedly ran into the back of a lorry the driver of the car allegedly started lashing out with his fistsHe allegedly attackedChan had allegedly hit the left side of his face so hard that it was bleeding.A yearold man suspected of assault was arrestedUnless theres already been a guilty verdict its always alleged assault or X was suspected of assault. I repeat its not the place of the media to determine whos innocent and whos guilty.gt THATS the problem with language like alleged rape victim. It puts the burden on the victim to prove they were raped. Theres no burden of proof on the victim because rape is not a civil offence. When someone gets raped its a criminal offence i.e. an offence against everyonethe state so the state has the burden of proof.gt Thats why rape goes underreportedInteresting notion slung around by the feministSJW sort but I have yet to see proof of that in Singapore. Prove it.gt so many men think they can and do get away with itInteresting notion. Prove it.gt we as a society still overwhelmingly question whether it even happened to the victimInteresting notion. Prove it.gt My argument is not about how alleged culprits are treated. I believe in innocence until guilt is proven. Thats where the word alleged comes from when its used for suspected culprits. But when you call someone an alleged victim you are framing them as not a victim until theyve been proven a victim. In other words guilty of faking it until proven innocent. Do you see my argument now?As chineseman said alleged doesnt mean fake. Alleged means that there the possibility of a crime but there is no proof yet of definite guilt or innocence. It is the job of the courts to determine guilt not you or me or the media.Yes calling someone an alleged victim means that theyre not yet proven to be a victim. But its sheer paradox to say that the rape victim was definitely a victim of a crime and no further proof is needed yet at the same time say that the accused is not necessarily guilty of being a rapist!,singapore,dflp2oy,2,t5_2qh8c

We have been made to feel profoundly permanently insecure by being taught our entire lives that life is a zerosum game that for me and mine to win you and yours must lose much more. Combine that with only family and clan matter or can be trusted and the fact that were not all violent sociopaths is a testament to the strength of human character.One of the traits of fascism historically has been an overemphasis on physical perfection when compared against a politically convenient ideal we see that here online and off every single day.We can do better.

11471918,0,t1_dfwbsuj,Thats a really good argument. I never thought of it that way before being perceived as selfish and greedy for wanting both financial security and yet also wanting establish financial independence.I was just discussing this with the BF yesterday if you were to look from the perspective of a careerdriven woman she wouldnt want to be with a man who has much less drive than her and as a result earns significantly lesser than her. People with drive naturally find goaloriented people appealing and will seek a relationship where both can challengeimproveencourage one another. Things would be different if say she is with a man who has the drive but is still in the process of getting theresuccess shed probably stay with him still and work on being successful together VS her not wanting to be with a man who has no drive and is content being stuck where he is with no desire to move up. Of course this only applies to women who do seek financial independence and solid careers. There are other women out there who dont fall in this category.Unfortunately SG still has the conservative cultural mindset that the men should still always have the ability to provide and if the women are going up in terms of success then the men have to adjust accordingly and be even more successful than them. ,singapore,dfwc4lu,3,t5_2qh8c

Within a month or so I noticed my posture getting better  not just sitting but also walking and standing.

11748338,0,t1_dgroa9a,Um female conscription is likely not going to be considered any time soon because  the common mindset is that women are physically and emotionally weak and dont belong in the army  conscripting women basically removes  years of their ideal fertility period and we all know SG is desperate for babies and women are only useful for making babies amirite. Im a feminist and I support female conscription and conscription for all genders... Conscription being maleonly only cultivates toxic attitudes towards women by men who feel robbed of years of their life through serving.  Anyway Im not an expert on the subject I just wanted to say that not all people who identify as feminists oppose female conscription and that conscription being maleonly is actually the result of sexist beliefs about women even though women benefit from it. ,singapore,dgrpc0g,18,t5_2qh8c

11750944,0,t1_dgroacg,Hello! I just started running in February used to be like you always stopping around the .km mark. What helped me to push through is choosing to run at night instead of the day the weather is cooler and less humid I could push pass the mark though. As well as mental strength theres always a short sudden wave of tiredness coming over you whenever you are trying to push yourself you have to be able to block it and push through once you push through that tiredness you will find that you can run for much longer. And for the short term it will be nice to have a goal on why you are running and keep pushing for that goal. Hopefully you will enjoy running in the long term thereby not needing a goal to keep you motivated to run. Try to get used to the feeling of running first before aiming to beat your timings.Cheers! You can do it!,singapore,dgrzz2p,1,t5_2qh8c

However the police officer whom he spoke to declined to file a case for him. Mr Koh claims that the officer declined to file a report for him because there has already been a case opened for the incident.gt gt But the report that I want to file is about the impersonation of me said Mr Koh on the matter and notes that the police is treating him as the prime suspect in the case of sending the letter to DPM. It was only under his insistence that another senior officer at the police station instructed the attending police officer to record his statement. However there was no case number given to Mr Koh or a duplicate copy of the statement taken.gt gt Mr Koh will be seeking to retrieve his phone from the police this coming week as many of his friends are unaware of the incident and unable to contact him as a result.gt gt He wants to resolve the investigation as soon as possible as he is trying his best to campaign and petition the government to provide an acceptable solution for the vendors at Sungei Road Secondhand Market in its remaining two months.gt gt In response to media queries Singapore Police Force said The police confirm that reports have been lodged. We are unable to comment further as investigations are ongoinggt gt TOC has also sent the following queries to the SPF on Friday morninggt gt  Why did the police see the need to visit Mr Kohs house at am in the middle of the night?gt gt  Why was there a need to photo Mr Koh when he already showed the police his ID?gt gt  Why was there a need to confiscate Mr Kohs phone given that the case at hand is a letter sent to DPM and the police cannot prove that Mr Koh is the person who sent the letter.gt gt TOC will update the article with the polices reply should they respond.gt gt Police receipt of Mr Kohs handphone which indicates the time and place where the phone was confiscated gt gt IMAGECreated by uFlareAbout Me Feedback Source Code,singapore,dgwhx00,2,t5_2qh8c
