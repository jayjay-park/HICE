2744278,0,t3_2rhrw4,gtso where do I find gaskets that will fit? The clue is the blueandwhite badge on the front of the car. While youre there pick up new manifold studs and nuts as well its  guaranteed that one will break when you replace the gasket so its best to swap them all over now if you have the tools and time to do so.As for your speedometer this is most likely corrosion of the wires to the speed sensor in the differential. The fix is to get any compatible plug from a scrapyard car E headlight plugs are a good source along with  inches of wire. Cut the old plug off solder the new wires on plug it in and hey presto!

4148636,0,t3_38610h,My first e was an  e that I picked up for  back around .  I wasnt much of a mechanic at the time and my only experience with car repair was some spark plugs and an ignition coil on my first car a Honda Accord.  That  needed a new center support bearing but being not so mechanically inclined I didnt think that weird thumping noise when I first accelerated was a big deal since it went away after  mph. One day Im driving and the thumping suddenly gets much much worse and after about  mile I hear this awful clanging sound.  Then I hear two or three really powerful thumps and the sound of something metal hitting the ground.  I got out of the car and found two halves of a weird metal ring under the car.  But the thumping stopped. Being stupid about cars I thought that it was awesome that it stopped.Fast forward two months and Im clipping along at about  mph when suddenly the car went nuts.  The thumping came back with a vengeance followed by a godawful metallic clanging.  It sounded and felt like the car was trying to tear itself apart.  I felt one huge bang and the car coasted to a stop along with a rhythmic dingdingdingding.  The car wouldnt move it would only give me that dinging.I found out that my driveshaft had snapped in half at the ujoints because the CSB had failed.  The first incident was the CSB tearing itself off the car and had I actually paid attention at that point I could have gotten away with a  fix.  Since I let it go another two months I wound up spending about  bucks on a full driveshaft.  After the fact I looked it up online and realized that a CSB is such a common problem  and that ten minutes of proactive research would have saved me  bucks.  This was the catalyst that got me into working on cars so I guess there is a silver lining but I learned an expensive lesson about ignoring problems.  I was stupid when I was .,E30,crt5r1r,3,t5_2sfyt

The E is no different.gtFirstly I was looking into buying an M. I dont have anywhere near that much to spend on a car. Is it possible to import one for cheaper I live in Dallas area for reference?Not a chance. Their price globally has shot through the roof and wont come down.gt Secondly whats the next best thing? I was surprised to see that the M actually had an I and the  had the I. Would it be easier to build the m over the s? And what makes the s a better platform.Motorsport engines came from a completely different factory with a completely different development team. They used independent throttle bodies aluminium parts etc etc. They were designed for racing and street versions were built more for homologation reasons rather than any serious mass production.But you dont build BMW engines from this era. The costtogain ratio is insane and you will have to throw  into any engine to get hp back. Absolutely not worth it which is why people do engine swaps instead.gtLastly besides the engine what sets apart an M over say a  or a is. How easyhard would it be to convert?Probably the only component they share is the fuse box lid. They are a completely different shell including windscreen rake and roof length. Building a copy will cost even more than buying one.gtI have a pretty good amount of experience with cars. Ive swapped  engines and built a race Miata so I can do basically anything on a car besides extremely technical stuff.So buy a e door shell rip out the pointless engine and fit a Motorsport engine from a newer M E E plus all the associated suspension and brake upgrades. Its been done many times.gtAlso I daily drove a  Miata on coilovers and currently drive a  jeep so literally anything is a step up. I dont care sacrificing how comfortable it is on the road for performance. Im used to discomfort. Besides if comfort was my priority Id get an eDont underestimate an M E those cars can be a serious weapon if maintained properly.

However... Youll find that the handbrake cables are seized into your existing hubs and the only way to remove them is to cut them in half so you need to replace the cables too.   The brake hoses will need replacing and once you drop the arms youll see the massive corrosion on the pipes at the Tpiece near the fuel tank so youll need new pipes too.   If youre going so far to drop all these parts you might as well remove the subframe and replace the bushes there. Its the single biggest performance upgrade you can do to an Es handling after  years.   If youre doing all this on your own then youll want to remove the differential separately as its really really fucking heavy.  So plan a diff swap at the same time as your i unit will be ridiculously geared for an M.  So overall what seemed like a simple brake swap results in you removing the complete back end off your car.
