435371,0,t3_1z279u,I played the hell out of this game. My childhood friend and I would often give crazy back stories to the fighters as to why they were fighting each other. Good times truly a gem in the Saturn library. ,SegaSaturn,cfpw3az,3,t5_2rk38

804397,0,t3_23ctcv,Steam Hearts  is a PC title developed by TGL which was later ported to the Sega Saturn in . The game is a vertical scrolling shooter interspersed with cutscenes featuring explicit sexual content. While the Saturn version does include these scenes they were toned down significantly to the point where the game received only a yellow label rating.Steam Hearts is an odd duck. Usually Saturn games like this come in the form of dating sims or strip majong but not this one! Nope Steam Hearts is a shootemup. Mind you its not a very good shootemup but it is a shootemup nonetheless. As if that werent strange enough the story revolves around curing rampaging elves and catgirls of a mindaltering disease by defeating their giant mechs and then shooting your load into them the girls not the mechs weirdo. As I mentioned before the actual shooter portion of Steam Hearts isnt so hot. Level design is rather plain and enemy attack patterns leave a lot to be desired. The game does put an impressive amount of enemies and projectiles on screen at the same time but this only leads to massive slowdown. The powerup system features a couple interesting weapons like the laser sword but avoiding powerups that you dont want is a serious chore. Probably my biggest complaint has to do with hit detection. Instead of lives your ship can take seven hits before it explodes forcing you to continue. Theres nothing wrong with this concept but unfortunately there isnt any real feedback when your ship runs into a projectile. Even worse theres virtually no invulnerability period after taking a hit so if you fly into a barrage of bullets youre pretty much screwed. Sadly the Saturn port is the most playable version of this game. The PC and Turbo CD releases are riddled with even more problems!Due of its unique place in the Saturns library Steam Hearts is an expensive purchase. Unless youre a serious collector though I dont recommend getting it. Save your money for something thats actually worthwhile.,SegaSaturn,cgvpp0y,3,t5_2rk38

5803725,0,t1_cw06607,Played the Saturn version have the PS version as well. It is an OK alternative. It has slowdown that the Saturn version didnt have which is annoying and funny considering the generational gap. However it does have unlimited credits so I can actually beat it. The Saturn version only gave  without the option to get more making it a much harder game. That said Legends  also has a competent port of Darius Gaiden as well so if you like shooters that might help the decision. ,SegaSaturn,cxgi9eu,1,t5_2rk38

I know that dithering was used for a long time in the bit era to simulate transparency and it was interesting to see the illusion broken once I started getting into upscaling with the XRGB line of products and RGB cables.

7610114,0,t3_4jjv98,Yes no and maybe. The easiest way if you had the source for the game would be to compile it with all the addresses for the text pointing to a ROM cartridge like kof ultraman with the text on it.The other way would also require the source but you would need to run the actual game from the cartridge itself and fetch the assets from the CD. Its quite a bit harder. You might also use a combination of the cartridge and the floppy drive in that case since you would get more storage to work with that way.I cant really see this being done without a ton of work from someone  who really knows what theyre doing and it would be a one of for that particular game.,SegaSaturn,d378bg2,1,t5_2rk38
