4577846,0,t3_3dq0se,Youve described the theory of purchasing power parity which itself is a special case of the law of one price. Most economists think this is a decent way to describe the movement of exchange rates in the long run but in the short run exchange rates tend to be impacted more by differences in interest rates. Specifically high interest rates cause financial inflows which causes appreciation and vice versa. This creates a friction with the PPP approach. Since central banks tend to cut interest rates in slumps which tend to coincide with low inflation....see the Phillips Curve lower inflation tends to result in relative depreciation of the domestic currency. Conversely when inflation is high central banks tend to increase interest rates which causes a relative appreciation of the domestic currency.,econhw,ct7n6hw,2,t5_2ywgb

5853108,0,t3_3vehus,Its unclear what youre asking. Are you trying to measure GDP per capita? Because theres no reason to use regression to do that. National accountants do a decent job of measuring GDP and population numbers are well measured by the census.Are you trying to predict GDP per capita? If so it really depends on the context within which you want to predict it.,econhw,cxmvcnb,3,t5_2ywgb

9049825,0,t1_d7zanto,This is wrong on many levels. First  lifetime income model isnt a thing. Im assuming you are referring to the lifecycle hypothesis of FriedmanModigliani. Given that your analysis is incorrect. Expected changes to future income will have no effect on currentperiod consumption. Also this result is invariant to your choice of expectations operator so your bizarre aside on rational expectations is completely irrelevant.,econhw,d7zn834,2,t5_2ywgb

11122771,0,t3_5yps4k,If more people want to save than people want to borrow either the interest rate will fall or that excess of savings needs to go overseas.  When savings go overseas then there needs to be a balance of payments entering the country.

11619306,0,t3_65su7j,. C D B is incorrect because import restrictions are often beneficial to domestic suppliers as it restricts supply raising the market price.. B Characteristics of a monopolisticly competitive firm are Many firms Low entry barriers and Product differentiation which is what gives the firms their low level of price control think cereal.. B? D Profit maximizing output for any firm will always occur where MRMC which D but B seems like its say the same thing so Im not sure why its wrong.However equilibrium price occurs directly above MRMC on the firms ARD curve this is the monopolys price setting power. . B C? A lump sum tax is an additional fixed cost so it will only shift the ATC upwards and have no effect on the firms MC. Therefore the firm will not move from the equilibrium position and only incur a fixed loss to their profit which is redistributed to the government. not sure why C would be wrong. D Creating a bargaining association similar to an inclusive union will turn the monopsony into a Bilateral Market where the collective bargaining power of the union will likely counteract the ability of the monopsony to set factor prices below MFCMRP. Setting a ceiling price instead of a price floor will only lower the market price and exasperate the situation.. C By out I assume they mean the rightward shift of the Demand curve or an increase in demand. If Good x is ketchup and the price of hotdogs a complementary good increases than people are less inclined to buy ketchup. An increase in population on the other hand will increase the number of potential buyers of ketchup and increase Demand.This is my first time posting here so hopefully this helped!,econhw,dgd250f,3,t5_2ywgb
