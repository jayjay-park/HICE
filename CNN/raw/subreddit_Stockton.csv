6376097,0,t1_czecpt9,Thanks. I just bought a tree from Costco a couple of days ago which made me more eager to taste it.  Who knows how many years itll be before I get fruit though.,Stockton,czee57o,1,t5_2qyje
7501160,0,t3_4i2ewe,Lake Tahoe is a little far for just a lake source my hometown is up there and its not that exciting unless you enjoy the ski resorts and gambling. Yosemite is a good idea and only a couple hours away.In addition to what others have said for local activities if you want to head to the beach taking the  west you can go to SF although theres not much for beaches there besides in the Golden Gate Park. My personal favorite beach is Half Moon Bay and on a good day you can get there in just an hour and a half. Its a quiet little town with beautiful beaches cute downtown shops a couple tidepool spots close by and the location of the Mavericks surf spot. Theres a decent amount of tourism there but its way better than the beaches in SF or Santa Cruz in my opinion I work in SF occasionally and my brother lives in Santa Cruz so Ive been up and down the coast by here. Hope you enjoy your stay here!,Stockton,d2uucw5,1,t5_2qyje
