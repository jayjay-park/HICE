6736580,0,t1_d0fpodc,To be fair the whole point of TTS is to be a table top simulator. it is meant to replicate the experience of playing on a real table where you dont have all those fancy features. You have your Hand which is representative of you holding it and you have the table surface. If you were playing such a game in real life you would have to pickup the card bring it closer to you to look at it and then put it back. ,tabletopsimulator,d0g4cub,3,t5_30u7h
6741375,0,t1_d0ghsbc,I agree with you that there is no point in sticking with the limitations of a physical sim. The digital interface is clearly less convenient than a physical tabletop in many respects so there should be compensatory advantages.I have previously suggested that owners of cards should be able to access the facedown side with altzoom. It would be easy to implement but I suspect the devs are very busy with the development of scripting.Scripting itself could provide a solution but I am hesitant to do much more of that while the API is in such drastic flux.,tabletopsimulator,d0gm6nu,1,t5_30u7h

7524986,0,t3_4ie08u,It does and i even saw a working one once. But that was a while ago.With some scripting that would be no problem ,tabletopsimulator,d2xjxvo,2,t5_30u7h
7574465,0,t1_d18v0cp,To add to this including different lighting colors would be nice as well. This could be integrated in scripting too making a light change colors depending on whose turn it is etc.But in general dynamic light sources and being able to adjust the brightness would be nice. Currently the custom background only has one brightness which isnt always the best. Some games work better in lower light so they dont look washed out and some need more light so they arent too dark to see.,tabletopsimulator,d336hab,2,t5_30u7h

But based on just the screenshots New composite board incorporated hiterlands spaces but Im not sure where one would put the ITL board Custom table background with more space to actually put stuff instead of relying on a separate addon table lol Boxed components no idea how this works I guess dragging bagsstacks of components out if you want to include characters or events from OTB or the red epidemic cards?Im happy to see more full mods show up.

8509703,0,t3_4w5zat,While playing DnD in TTS can be fun for small campaigns or sessions because of D maps and models it is far inferior to almost all dedicated roleplay tabletops out there in terms of campaign creation management and usability.

9407694,0,t1_d8o08ga,Yes I participated in that forum discussion if it is the one I am thinking of and the developer suggested that they could provide a way for you to import your own skybox as an asset bundle and then disable the default one.  Im not sure where that went but the developer seemed to suggest that such a thing is possible and might be something they could implement without too much trouble.  You would just need to have a skybox available to replace it.  The one I would want would have  lighting and then I could use lights and and fires to illuminate the scenery as per needed.  In fact I can create a light as a torch and give it to the characters using joint and they would illuminate the scene as they move around which would be utterly awesome.,tabletopsimulator,d98hp26,1,t5_30u7h

9538736,0,t3_5bi7x1,With the options in the game it isnt an issue for the most part. Trolls are rare but when they come in and smash the table you can use the back button. The game also saves your table at intervals I think. Otherwise just let people in and if they are disruptive or not following rules kick them! Edit you can also lock items that only you can manage and unlock! ,tabletopsimulator,d9ouj52,1,t5_30u7h

Blender is better for more precise UVs than Sketchup.Regarding shininess  in the custom options ingame go to the second page for the specular settings.  Change the type to cardboard or whatever type you want and move down all the light settings  cant remember what they are but they affect how much light reflectsglaresetc on the model in game.,tabletopsimulator,dc5ashb,2,t5_30u7h

11544490,0,t3_64pe7p,To be fair it is our responsibility to know where the models we use are coming from they dont have to tell you. If you arent sure then theres a real chance you used something copyrighted and they legitimately had it removed.Work on sourcing back everything that wasnt part of the DLC. If you arent sure look for free generic models available from reputable sources to stand in or create your own. We all can be a little guilty of some infringement here or there but if we get called out on it its our job to let it go or fix our mistakes.And if everything you used was your own and you know you didnt infringe you can defend yourself against the claim. Im not a lawyer so I dont know if thats a good idea or not but it sounds like you probably infringed.,tabletopsimulator,dg4kis3,4,t5_30u7h
