The SARS mask is regular disease control practice in Asian countries particularly China Japan and South Koreaalso prevalent in other asian countries Since a very young age kids are taught nowadays that wearing a mask when you are sick is very important. Its a really effective means of reducing spread and sort of became attached to coolness in westerners eyes because they see kpop stars and other celebrities wearing the masks. If you go to any asian country youll see people of all ages wearing them.,veteranpacks,dbmzr6l,4,t5_3hdoh
