The last census of West Prussia as a whole was in  and on top of that the war caused many people to flee westward from East Prussia.

3502944,0,t1_cppwdit,The Deutsches Reich sends a letter to the Paris Conference with the following contentsBonjour and Good Morning to our Esteemed ColleaguesIn light of the recent situation in Eastern Europe Germany needs to maintain a military larger than you are currently suggesting.  Currently Poland is raising over  troops and with a peace treaty signed with the Soviets the implications for our eastern lands is frightening.  In addition this proposal will also make it difficult for us to uphold our guarantees of Czechoslovakia and other countries as well from both the Poles and the Soviets.  At the same time we understand French concerns of future German attack.  We thus offer a potential roadmap to peace in EuropeThe German military will consist of no more than  men of which only  can be within km of the Rheinland designated as the city of Koln without prior Entente approval.No conscription subject to Entente modifications in the event of an outright and unprovoked attack on German territory.We believe the artillery issue is something that the Entente needs to further elaborate on.Submarines will be limited to two experimental type vessels at any given time.The British proposal for aircraft is sufficient.Subject to the above we agree to the French terms for naval forces and field works although we believe the League of Nations restriction is a bit too harsh.,themapgame,cprk6rj,1,t5_34dpl
