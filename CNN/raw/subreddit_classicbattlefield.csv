Ezines  abandonware sites youtubers it was a fight.  Some of us never stopped fighting.  The older Battlefield titles are unique in the fact that they were robbed of their true sunset period. Similar aged titles end up on steam  origin or other major sites and can get a trickle feed of new players.  There is no  revival at this time.  Spread the word the abandonware dl and join the fight.  Then relax with some gaming wo unlocks and additional buyins.    ,classicbattlefield,d7x9x5z,2,t5_2rp6y
