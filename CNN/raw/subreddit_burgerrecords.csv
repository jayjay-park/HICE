3506367,0,t1_cprxx5f,Either they are overselling OR they genuinely havent sold out because of how overcrowded Burgerama  and Beach Goth were. Navigating the two inside stages becomes nearly impossible well before sundown. If they are overselling then the fan experience will be severely impacted even more than last year. Burgerama is too big for the venue if they hang on to that venue for much longer it wont last.,burgerrecords,cpry8ml,3,t5_2wjpw
