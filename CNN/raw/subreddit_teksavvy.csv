389579,0,t3_1yh43q,TekSavvy Solutions Inc.s NOW ThinkFree Contest the Promotion is open only to legal residents of Canada who are at least eighteen  years of age at the time of entry.scroll scroll scrollPromotion not available to residents of Quebec.Last time I checked Quebec was in Canada... I know its more of a bitch to have these contests in Quebec due to the laws surrounding them in Quebec. But is it REALLY that hard to go slightly out of your way to include Quebecers?,teksavvy,cfl5982,1,t5_2stmg

3716558,0,t1_cqeo5bw,no its more because it should be under wireless or routers instead of teksavvy as your problem isnt with techsavvy but with your wireless router. That being said you have the answer  MAC address filtering.,teksavvy,cqfwx1i,1,t5_2stmg
4927242,0,t1_cufls2t,Ok thanks for explaining that!Going back to my original question do you know if there are any plans to approve newer modems in the coming months? I dont want to get stuck buying an datedonarrival modem again.,teksavvy,cufm97q,1,t5_2stmg
5076672,0,t3_3kje0k,Hey there udrippingdown  Thanks so much for taking the time to post this review. Its always wonderful to hear about customers enjoying their services. I do apologize for the miscommunication during your install though unfortunately the Telus technicians do not always call before showing up and if they do not need to enter the premises to complete the install you may never know they were even there.  At any rate Im glad to read that youve enjoyed your experience with us aside from that minor hiccup and would like to thank you again for taking time out of your day to compliment us.  If you ever have any questions or concerns please be sure to let us know.Best regards  Jon,teksavvy,cuxxi9f,2,t5_2stmg
5258998,0,t3_3n0ios,Unfortunately these telemarketers usually call with a Spoofed Caller ID to begin with so blocking just their caller ID wont do much for you.You could adapt a whitelist approach with inbound numbers and automatically send the unknown callers to voicemail. If its something important theyll probably leave one unless the telemarketer is extremely persistent and leave something nasty on your voicemail just to tick you off.If ritslenny was still functional then you could always send them over to Lenny and have them deal with them.,teksavvy,cvjwbhn,6,t5_2stmg
5623012,0,t3_3s3tut,Hello thereThank you for your inquiry!Our VDSL plans do have recommended approved modems because during testing we found that these modems gave the best experience.  If you prefer to use a modem of your choice you can do so but if there are issues that may not be there when using an approved modem there may be issues in resolving the issue.If you have further questions or you require further assistance please dont hesitate to let us know!RespectfullyTSI Sue,teksavvy,cwu36mf,1,t5_2stmg

8455317,0,t1_d5yg3dc,Thanks so I can give them a call tonight? About PTR record do I have control over this or would I give you the hostname which I would like the record to point at? My mail server is getting rejects from some domains and seems like on Google people are saying this will happen if you dont have a valid PTR record for your IP which matches the domain of your mail server. Is it also possible to request  IP along with static IP using the  call?Im on DSL so should be good to go I hope.,teksavvy,d5yg777,1,t5_2stmg

10092992,0,t1_dblfu5x,Hey thereThe Sagemcoms dont really bridge though you can still set them up to act as a bridge in a way. You can also still use it as a modemrouter and just use your airport for the wireless. You would want to look into using the Airport as an Access Point that way the router functions NAT DHCP etc are hopefully not being performed twice.If you are looking for a new modem then it really depends on the service you are on. Anything  and higher would require one of a handful of VDSL approved modems. The approved and tested modems are as follows  Cellpipe   Sagemcom FST   Smart RG SRNWe sell the SmartRG SRN which is still a combo device but can be truly bridged.Regards  TSI Sean,teksavvy,dbn4shd,1,t5_2stmg

10441001,0,t3_5pj8vm,I could be wrong but I kinda doubt Teksavvy is inspecting.  Its more likely your IP leaked and you got caught.  Did you disable PeX?  Are you sure your torrent client is using the proxy for peer connections and not just the tracker?,teksavvy,dcrkdbi,6,t5_2stmg
10701461,0,t1_ddjrrwo,Ive submitted a ticket and they responded saying theyll look into it. I didnt ask if its Shaws fault but I can ask about it when they get back to me again.,teksavvy,ddjrycp,1,t5_2stmg
10954324,0,t3_5wf419,Hey there!Unfortunately all modems must be approved for use on each infrastructure.  If they are not approved they can not be used.We allow you to provide your own as long as it is on our approved modem list available on our website and not currently tied to or active with another provider. This list can be found by ensuring you are on the correct province top right corner of the website selecting Internet and then Cable entering your Postal Code and then selecting the cable package that you are interested in and selecting the Approved Modem tab.As for the router you would have research it online to make sure it can handle the speed you order. Most routers even older ones can. Looking at the spec sheet there should be no problems with this router handling even our Cable  plan. ,teksavvy,de9uzr0,3,t5_2stmg
