1476852,0,t3_2alj1s,Late to the party but hard lenses last quite some time. Ive tended to bounce around prescriptionwise in the ten years since I was diagnosed but I can easily get two years out of a pair of hard lenses. You get one pair and you wear them till your prescription changes your fit changes you have to get them fitted to your eye so you will probably be trying a few on or theyre just no good any more.They are uncomfortable to get used to. It feels like an eyelash kind of that moves when you blink. It took me about a month to fully get used to them. I started with hybrids though when I was first diagnosed. But in  hybrids sucked and so I switched. I understand now hybrids are much better so you may want to inquire about those.Im kind of hazy on how much my vision improved back then but right now if I could not wear my RGPs and was forced to only wear glasses I would be legally blind.  corrected with glasses. Glasses do not work for me at all. With my RGPs Im ish right now. I have very slight astigmatism while corrected but nothing that requires extra correction.As far as swimming goes wear some goggles. Im very nervous about swimming with my RGPs so I have some disposable soft lenses not anywhere near my real prescription but good enough for getting around while swimming that I wear with and without goggles. I also have incredibly poor sight I would not be a candidate for LASIK by prescription alone even if I didnt have keratoconus so in recent years Ive been anxious about being able to see while I swim and this was the solution my optometrist and I worked out.Good luck!,Keratoconus,cj1edak,1,t5_2r6xc
2211069,0,t3_2kf93j,Thanks for that advice. Ill go look up RGP and hybrid lenses. Someone also mentioned scleral. Do your lenses help with distortion? Do you see fewer halos? That sounds like a bit of heaven to me...,Keratoconus,clkvpgj,1,t5_2r6xc

2780936,0,t3_2q7rd1,I paid  US for one lens but they give a nice discount if you buy two at a time.   I think it was only another  for the second if ordered at the same time. One lens lasts around  months.   My insurance covered most of my lenses.  I think I paid about  out of pocket.,Keratoconus,cnk6lkr,1,t5_2r6xc
3932093,0,t3_35g5cm,Most optometrists can easily tell if you have keratoconus even without a cornea topography but like already suggested I would get one done. Also if youre not happy with the optometrists conclusion I would go see an ophthalmologist and explain to them in detail whats going on with your vision.As far as your question on can keratoconus be present without a cornea protrusion. I believe it can be at the very earlier stages but the very reason why your vision with KC deteriorates is because your cornea thins out and the internal pressure within your eye causes the protrusion of your cornea preventing glasses from being able to correct the problem. As far as what to do to fix it. Id first get a proper diagnosis before doing anything because it may not be KC. ,Keratoconus,cr4hsic,1,t5_2r6xc

4621660,0,t3_3e716f,My KC started this way and came on quite quickly. I was diagnosed at  and now at  it has not advanced much further. Contact lenses dont completely resolve the ghosting for me but they do help at night which is when its very noticeable. I still get  vision with glasses and Ive learned to tune out the ghosting during the day.Its always worth trying some lenses as they might work for you. Ive found that optometrists can sometimes focus too much on vision acuity and you have to make sure they understand the impact  the ghosting has on your vision.Hope this helps.,Keratoconus,ctd4w9s,3,t5_2r6xc

5823618,0,t3_3uz14y,The vision went okay for me after  weekshad cxl  times in total. Pain can last longer Ive heard but for me it was basically gone after  daysokayish after hrs. Going to university should be possible after  or  days if thats what you want. Its always helpful to have someone that can help you in case you cant read sth.

7115176,0,t1_d1luk12,Yeah. One thing was the possibility of haze or something like that. Another was just the risk of infection that is present with every type of invasive surgery. But even though epion is considered safer that doesnt mean that epioff should be considered dangerous. Theyve been doing it for years all over the world. ,Keratoconus,d1mwkvs,1,t5_2r6xc
7206530,0,t1_d1x55dp,Ive been at work almost straight through since I made my comment. I posted in this thread when I first saw it for a reason to make sure that OP talked to his own doctor to make sure he had a crystal clear understanding of what to expect in terms of recovery time after the surgery so that they could time their surgery to minimize the impact on their life. I didnt do this prior to my surgery and I paid the price for it in my life and in my business. The inability to see properly for months had a significant impact on my life for months. I dont want anyone else to not pay adequate enough attention to their own projected recovery time.Overall the surgery has been helpful though I didnt experience quite as good results as those advertised.I did not know which type of procedure I had. In fact I didnt even know there was more than one type of CXL treatment available. I went to the website for the Eye institute where I had the surgery and it provided no answers. That said based on your post I believe I did have an epioff procedure since I definitely had the laser surgery first prior to the CXL. I wore a protective lens for a week or so post treatment to allow my cornea time to regrow.,Keratoconus,d1xbpq9,1,t5_2r6xc

8504410,0,t1_d63uwan, Its kind of like if you went swimming in chlorine for too long crossed your eyes slightly so things doubled up and you looked through a Fresnel lens common A magnifying sheet from a distance. Its kinda tricky to stand up without my glasses since my AXIS is sooooooo different as are the Cyl rates on my glasses. I can read this subreddit from about cm back from a  screen   windows scaling.about pt font If I havent worn my glasses for a few days yes I can drive without correction but I dont.  Squinting HARD fixes my vision probably  since the failures on my cornea are down low so the bottom eyelid moves up and covers it. Too far up for a surgical squint though Ive already talked to a surgeon about that. Probably worth noting if I dont wear correction for a few days I can function quite well. Headaches to the max. But I can watch TV and game easily enough. Just no text reading.,Keratoconus,d64lt36,1,t5_2r6xc
8505822,0,t1_d64mduc,Thank you so much for your information. In regards to the PRK there was a hefty process of determining the thickness of the cornea and the amount of healthy cells present in the the cornea to allow the surgeon to safely correct vision but also not to risk complication.  From what I was told though you are not losing corneal material but corneal structural integrity. Cross linking literally means chemically linking the collagen in the cornea to strengthen it and prevent further progression.  My doctor is one of the leading corneal specialists in Canada but after this regression I will be sure to push him for other options. Im also seeing another corneal specialist in the USA so I will ask him as well.Is your night vision affected by the eye drops? ,Keratoconus,d64s6ii,2,t5_2r6xc
8615329,0,t1_d6e3taz,Yes otherwise you get bubbles which will reflect light through them making it annoyingimpossible to see normally.But they do are very comfortable but my eyes are very dry which makes drops a must. Might vary from person to person though.,Keratoconus,d6iiiq3,1,t5_2r6xc

9319102,0,t1_d8wtwar,The doctor who fitted me for my sclerals recommended lenses for each even though I didnt need one for my left because of mental strain.  Im in a similar situation. Crosslinking didnt do all that much for me. Definitely ask your doctor but I think that you should only do it if you may not be able to get it on.,Keratoconus,d8x9iqj,1,t5_2r6xc

I locked myself up in my dark basement with no lights on and a TV that I could only  listen to for the first  days.

11055893,0,t3_5xd1tl,Some dude PMd me for some additional details and in the interest of public knowledge heres what I told himDo you still have to wear contacts after the transplant?  Yes I still wear contacts  I think pretty much everyone does. I get the impression some people still need to wear hard lenses which is too bad I do not. I wear a totally normal contact in my left eye and a Kerasoft special but still soft in my right. No special care for the lenses. I use two different kinds of eye drops  a steroid and I dunno some other thing  and check in with an eye surgeon once a year or so. What happens with your eyes afterwards?Far as what happens with your eyes...for me there was major discomfort on night one drugs helped! and significant discomfort for a few days I was out of work for  weeks with generally not super hot vision. They pulled the sutures out after a while when they started to come loose  that suuuucks because theyre literally pulling thread out of your eyes with tweezers while you just sit there  but whatever its over in like a minute. After that my eyes feel totally fine.,Keratoconus,del60qz,1,t5_2r6xc
