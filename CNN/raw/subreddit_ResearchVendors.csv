5991598,0,t3_3xgi40,Id like to add to this thread and let everyone know my experience with Swarley. My first order was made a week ago and I am one of those people who had their package sent out on Thursday and my tracking has not budged since USPS was notified and I paid extra for express. Yes it sucks that my package has not come but Swarley has been extremely fast responding to my questions and very professional. There is only so much he can do once the package has been dropped off. It is a very busy time of year and USPS can be slow. Very slow. I have faith that my package will come soon and if it does not well this thread is about him sending out a reship. ,ResearchVendors,cy512lb,2,t5_3b1wm

6934925,0,t1_d12chaq,post some unintelligible shit on your siteHuh?  Looking at the first revision of the post youre talking about the only issue with it is that I was typing on a keyboard where neither the space bar nor the n key worked very well and was typing in enough of a hurry that I didnt bother correcting it.  I didnt bash him for a grammatical error his initial contact simply made no sense.  If I jam my head on my keyboard over and over again the result is not a grammatical error.I do not violate my terms of use and could not do so if I wanted to. Blacking out some personal information Ill send evidence of that to a mod if they request it.  The dude who reviewed me who is now banned from a sub isnt banned because of the review hes presumably banned because he quite literally called a mod a retard.I havent offered incentives for reviews and dont need to.  Ive filled  paid orders since Friday and thats a pace Im more than content  with.  Ill have a significant order of Ezilam showing up on Monday or Tuesday of next week and intend to stick pretty closely to the product stocking plan Ive outlined elsewhere with one exception  I have preliminary plans to start stocking a set of colorimetric reagents for the novel TZDs and BZDs in the not distant future.While I have plans to get four or five brands of blistered etizolam quantified in the not distant future can you name some vendors selling blistered pharma etiz that have produced NMRs for their products previously?  I have trouble thinking of any.Its a bit funny that you complain about how civility has declined in a post where you accuse me of being a lying dick asshole who is somehow responsible for the act that someone got banned for calling a mod a retard.,ResearchVendors,d12ef85,-2,t5_3b1wm

7844056,0,t1_d3xmefg,I just wanted to pop in and confirm what tropical has said here as well as address some of the concernspoints you brought up Oxy. I was first invited to the mod team by tropical several months ago. Wed been friends for a bit and chatted here and there on Tox. At that point I wasnt really sure I wanted to be a part of the team there as I hated Wikdd quite deeply from the beginning and didnt want to be associated with his name there at all. However it was from my understanding that Wikdd would step into the shadows and leave the newly appointed team to control things without any intervention. This appealed to me as I knew that myself Tropical and the other mods onboard had a similar level of care towards the community and I knew this was an opportunity to flip things around over there.I wasnt aware as to how Tropical had an affiliation with Wikdd that landed him as sort of the organizer of the initial mod team but it was clear at that time that we both didnt look too fondly towards him. This notion that they were working together is highly unlikely. Tropical was talking poorly and getting in arguments with Wikdd before he had even taken seriously the idea of becoming a vendor. He also told me that Wikdds absence was due to him being in rehab so I can confirm that note of the proposed timeline above as well.Tropical was a stellar mod. Both him and Philly really carried the modding team over there with their decisions and implementations. They deserve a significant amount of credit for making it that sub the market that many of us wanted it to be. Overall the place was great until Wikdd fucked it like I knew he would. So Tropical was modding for a few weeks before he told me that he was going to begin vending. I have every reason to believe that he had no nefarious intentions in using his position of power as a mod nor do I think his idea to become a vendor spawned out of him having mod abilities and seeing any sort of advantage out of this. I believe that he took the mod position out of a love for the community and he later became conflicted as he decided he also wanted to venture into vending.I was surprised he even told me that he would be opening a shop as this required a deal of trust for me to not sound the alarms and make a reveal that a mod was a vendor. I questioned myself why he would do this as he could easily have gone under the radar and vended without telling me. I came to the conclusion that he genuinely both wanted to continue serving the community as a mod while maintaining his position as a vendor without the two positions interfering. Why else would he ask that I be particularly aware and to keep an eye towards any instances where he may be overstepping any boundaries? I never noticed any such cases and as he said the mod log doesnt lie either. There was never any conflict between the two positions he held and as such I saw no issue no need to reveal this tidbit to the community and I very much would have if there was reason to.I never received nor was offered and sort of kickback for keeping this secret. Thats not how TropicalCedar saw things or operated. When Cedar Falls closed unexpectedly due to another issue entirely he offered those with outstanding orders overcompensation in refunds or excess chemicals. Why do this if he was a scammer? I dont even think Cedar Falls Labs was planned at the time that Wikdd initially gave Tropical mod powers. Tropical and I were equally pissed when upon his return Wikdd started pulling shenanigans like working with the scammer TizzTabz. Tropical disliked Wikdd and him and I both got in arguments with him when he returned. Nobody was on good terms with Wikdd. I also want to add that you linked to Wikdds latest shitposting. You really should take everything he posts in there and against any of the former mods with a grain of salt. Even in that thread he blatantly made lies the most provable being the one that claimed three of the previous  mods were all Tropicals accounts a claim that is ridiculous.Wikdd is an established bartard hes been proven to support scammers I can explain his connection with TizzTabz if need be and HE is the one that unrolled the scam youre accusing Tropical of conspiring. Wikdd made a vendor account while mod and actually abused his powers ultimately scamming members of the community. TropicalCedar did not.,ResearchVendors,d3xqou0,6,t5_3b1wm

8163309,0,t3_4qpnyv,I had a few successful orders from CG and I also enjoyed chatting with Chaotic for a bit about a month back. They truly seem to care about customer safety and privacy. Their online store seems to be set up better than most they actually redirect their website to the SSL secured page if any sensitive data might potentially be submitted across the wire!. There are WAY too many vendors who are lacking in online security knowledge to safely operate an online storefront and just slap a bunch of website plugins and libraries together.The last order I placed was a custom order and while I did receive some extra goodies there was an item that I was counting on more than anything else in the order that I did not receive it was very insignificant costwise but I didnt receive it regardless. I understand mistakes happen and I opened  tickets about it over the course of  weeks and I received no response. Then out of the blue all my tickets were deleted about a month later.I then sent an email to their team and I received a message from Colby asking what the missing item was literally no more than a  item and if I would like it to be reshipped which I said yes of course but here I am several weeks later and I still have not received it.Every order before this was spot on and I enjoyed dealing with this vendor. However I have chosen to do business elsewhere until this is straightened out. I hope their many recent promises of improved communication are fulfilled because I would not hesitate to do business with them again if they make this right.,ResearchVendors,d4xymum,1,t5_3b1wm
