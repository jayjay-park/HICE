6378342,0,t1_czebbxi,gt But how could you confirm that its Yuri Lowenthal? Some voice actors that are not one trick ponies have range. Sure while voicing teenage characters in cartoons he uses higher pitch than for adults. In your linked video there are several times where his voice is a perfect match Ace combat character Hayate from DoA Cecil Harvey Nolan McNamara from Fallout New Vegas Soma Schicksal this is simply identical. At this point Im tired of listing things that any person without tinfoil headphones would hear so yes this is Yuri Lowenthal.,gamedetectives,czencu2,-1,t5_3bopi

8793857,0,t3_50ix2h,Theres no realistic way for blizzard to accurately track participants in this ARG.   I think a massive lore release that is satisfying in its extent and content would be great but thats secondary. In my mind Sombra has to be a really well designed game element that is fun to play and brings a lot of newnessinnovation to the game. Even hitting both of those just right Im still of the opinion that the whole ARG has been somewhat overplayed and suboptimally paced.
