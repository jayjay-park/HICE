2074396,0,t1_cl3hfn8,Arg. But I love these trees. I posted on a larger site and they said their forums are filled with trees with the same damage. I may be SOL with this. And this may be why I cant find any for sale.,sfwtrees,cl3i1tj,2,t5_2tbsv
2292525,0,t1_clnorbe,I agree. Trees and fungi have lived with each other for millenia and while some are harmful.. some are not. Luckily  this isnt and a fungicidal treatment is WAY overkill.,sfwtrees,clv2m6j,1,t5_2tbsv

2848903,0,t1_cnrwytp,I would never ever send this guy on my job site without training and supervision! He has zero clue how to use a saw correctly. Without proper education I wouldnt know either. Im sure thats just one of his many jobs. Its easier to pay ol dude by the hour than bid out this clearing to a legit company.

3639578,0,t1_cq73toz,No not that I have noticed concerning the brown foliage. I dont believe it is oak wilt because the trees have been sick for quite some time.  or  years. I understand oak wilt typically kills the trees more rapidly,sfwtrees,cq750uo,1,t5_2tbsv
4273633,0,t3_39wpwi,Fun fact. Some say its called the monkey puzzle as it would puzzle a monkey to climb it. Also some say its called this as the branches remind them of monkeys tails.,sfwtrees,cs7cu4h,1,t5_2tbsv
4311124,0,t1_csbj93s,These were the small cones at the bottom of the tree could not get to the top for the big cones. I cut the green one just to take another one home but I should not have they take two years to mature. The brown mature ones do have some seeds not  all but most. Thanks for the tip on the pinus edulis and monophylla will look them up. ,sfwtrees,csbl99a,1,t5_2tbsv
4330328,0,t3_3akt27,I think the first questions you should ask yourself are Am I the sort of person who wants to get up early and spend my entire day outside in the heat not so much in Ottawa and cold lots of that up there doing strenuous physical labor while covered with dirt and sawdust?  Do i mind taking a dump in a portajohn every day?  Can I start at just above the minimum wage and maintain my motivation for a year or even longer while I prove to my bosses what I can do?Youre going to have to answer a resounding yes to all three of those questions.  Nobody shows up to their first day in a career field and gets to do the sexy work.  You will likely be raking leaves and chipping branches for a good while.  And the thing is thats okay.  This is when you have the opportunity to learn and ask questions.  If your boss is a good one he or she will answer them.  Hey boss why do we make that cut in that particular spot?  Is this disease common in this area?  How tall can we expect this tree to get?  Whats the best way to rig that branch?While youre doing all that on the job you can do your own studying at night.  Learn about trees and tree climbing.  Hook up with some recreational climbers if thats the route you want to take in the business.  Read the ISA literature.  Get good at your job.  If you do those things and above all SHOW UP READY FOR WORK ON TIME EVERY SINGLE GOD DAMNED DAY you should be fine.,sfwtrees,csdr9pj,5,t5_2tbsv

4813934,0,t1_cu017dk,to be honest I doubt it.that wound is gigantic and it will never heal over fast enough to prevent it from rotting.it may last several more years but it will die within the next  for sure. and I think its better to take it down now and plant something new that will look good in a couple of years rather than having an ugly dying tree for  years and ten planting something new.,sfwtrees,cu1c4cu,2,t5_2tbsv

6413663,0,t1_czi6zv7,It can indicate stress and a tree out of its best climate as sometimes trees will put branches out lower if the supply of water or nutrients to a main trunk is lacking.

7995441,0,t1_d4eq8zr,Its a tradeoff in risk.  Correct a correct pruning cut will heal faster without it but a random wound like thisI think you should weigh the risk of disease.  Depends on how your area is for pests that transmit oak wilt or not.,sfwtrees,d4erhw7,-1,t5_2tbsv
8503311,0,t3_4w69do,The moss and lichen are not harming your tree but you do have a rust fungus Gymnosporangium sabinae.  I didnt see any scales but maybe there is a more astute arborist here who knows more about that. Remove the affected leaves as soon as you see the orange spot.For the lack of fruit your soil may be depleted of nutrients from all the rain. Get a soils test or just add some compost near the feeder roots.,sfwtrees,d64gugn,1,t5_2tbsv
