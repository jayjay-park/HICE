328792,0,t1_cfeprp3,Wow that really helped a lot.  Sorry I am such an uber noob.  I just started looking at css for the first time yesterday.Can I pick your brain for one more thing?  I am using the following to make the background of everything be a consistent colors.body .tabmenu li.selected a .link .title BackgroundcolorFFDDcolorDCborderpx borderbottompx outlinenonemarginright.empaddingpxThe problem is that I guess .link .title isnt specific enough.  What happens is that selected links that get highlighted no longer apply the highlighting to the area immediately around the link.  On a related note I would like to change the highlighting color if possible.,csshelp,cfeumbd,1,t5_2roaw

If you have    .something  color red in RES then you need to make it more specific to override it eg    .parent .something  color red If its specific to RES then its usually easiest to apply the res class that RES applies to the body for convenience.    .res .something  color red ,csshelp,cff3o7s,1,t5_2roaw

1484379,0,t3_2b4cog,For your CSS code  you might appreciate using SciTE a crossplatform text editor itll give you line numbers and code folding along with color syntax highlighting and other usefull features. Once you have SciTE installed and loaded  going to the Lauguage section of the tool bar itll drop down and you can sellect CSS and youll be set. Same thing for any other scripting language you use for unrelated projects.Dont forget to SAVE your .CSS with SciTE on your local system and youll always have a backup of your style sheet in case things go south on Reddit. This would also give you a template for your other subreddits if you do more than one you can even work on multiple style sheets in tabs. Though in the end youll still need to copy amp past all your completed code to your subreddits Edit Stylesheet page then upload whatever graphics youre using if any making sure the file names match up with the ones in your code or vice versa. Usually we have  a private testSubreddit to prototype and see how our style sheet is going to look... and once youve got it to your satisfaction you can port it all over to your official public subreddit remembering to upload your graphics as well.,csshelp,cj2cc0q,1,t5_2roaw

But the website resources section specifically enable your subreddits wiki amp campp that material onto a resources wiki page ie  Link to that wiki page in your sidebar. Oh I just saw you have an FAQ too! Definitely put that in your wiki too amp link to it! Customize your tab menu to match the text color amp background color of your submit buttons Edit the flair a bit  it looks like  or  pt amp bolded right now. I think thinning out the text ie normal amp putting it at  pt would be nice. Submitted content seems to be a lot of selfposts so creating a cool selfpost thumbnail to replace the default reddit selfpost thumbnail would probably be nice. Sidebar titles amp boxes. You have a lot of great information in the sidebar but spacing things out with boxes amp titling the paragraphs looks better. Id even say you could maybe increase the width of your sidebar so people can see more info when they initially nav to the sub. A sidebar border would probably look clean amp professional.  pixel wide or something. Last but not least Im addicted to putting a gradient shadow thing under the header line amp I think itd look great on this sub too dividing bar under logo header mozboxshadow px px px webkitboxshadow px px px boxshadow px px px marginpxpaddingborderbottomnonewidthzindex,csshelp,cr0nfvf,2,t5_2roaw

Thats working fine.The shifting is as I mentioned before due to not properly adding all the CSS I suggested before. You added    headerimgahover          opacity     then added fontsize  into the existing headerimga block but you neglected to add    headerimg         margin     It appears you mistakenly added it into the headerimga block.For the thumbs I forgot to mention that you need to add zindex  into the .thumbnail block.,csshelp,d3c7djs,1,t5_2roaw

8410977,0,t3_4usuyk,HiAs the rpokemontrades mod who implemented it Ill try to explain what I did as well as I can.Reddit doesnt let you edit actual HTML but you do have freedom to enter text on the submit page via subreddit settings gt submission text box. Heres the markdown we have there for one of the tags    Event Gen rpokemontradessubmit?selftexttrueamptextevent tagev The tagev part is what you style using ahreftagev. Heres what we use for the event tag    .submitpage ahreftag         color fff!important        backgroundcolor         font  px sansserif        padding px px        borderradius px        border         verticalalign middle        position relative        whitespace nowrap        overflow visible        maxwidth none        minwidth px        textalign center            .submitpage ahreftagev         backgroundcolor eb    Theres a couple redundanciesunneeded code in there as we also apply it to other things like linkflairlabel etc but there you go anywayThe link is just a direct link to a submit page that automatically adds the event text to the body of the post. So you click the link you get redirected to a page thats pretagged. Add the rest of the tags next to each other no line breaks between the tags and some text at the top about reading the rules and such and you wind up with thisWe also decided that bumping the box to be above the text would be more user friendly. Not sure if you wanted to do that too but here you go just in case    .submitpage .formtabscontent .infobar         height px        .submittext.enabled         position absolute         top px        .submitpage ahreftag         webkittextsizeadjust     Tweak the two numbers until it looks right and change the tag part as needed.The first part adds more space on the top and the second part bumps the text box from underneath the post to above the post. Note that youll probably have to tweak it some more from there  for example the first part does this on a default Reddit submit page so youd obviously want to take out the gold coloring or itll look bad. The third part is a bug fix. Theres an iPhone iOS glitch that caused issues with the tags. The way it resizes text meant the tags were too big meaning more vertical space was needed but if I added more space itd be too much space for basically every other device. So that bit of code normalizes it.I cant effectively walk you through implementing it on your sub but feel free to ask if anything doesnt make sense.,csshelp,d5sx02u,4,t5_2roaw
8433776,0,t1_d5vp7pg,I got that part. Where exactly? You can use    .comment .expand  top px to pull them up.,csshelp,d5vrfik,1,t5_2roaw
8537831,0,t1_d682ftu,gt The rriddles spoiler implementation doesnt seem to work with the second type of link properly.Ultimately there is no difference between    and    That said either will work as a spoiler provided they end in sp as that is all their CSS looks for. So    will work as would    By work I mean work as the CSS is intended in that the content will be masked. The problem with the first one is obviously that if the link is clicked itll take them to .comsp which is breaking the link.The problem with the latter is that it points to redditcomsp. So neither work as links to their intended target but they do work as spoilers. This is all that the CSS was meant to do.Im still not  clear on what youre going for here. No matter what type of link or whatever other element you need some way to identify it as a spoiler. The whole reason for using links as spoilers to begin with wasnt to have them work as links. It was simply because links are the only thing we can make that can have unique attributes hreftitle. In the HTML every h looks like every other h every table looks like every other table and so on.It sounds kind of like youve run into a sub that uses the titletype spoilers. These work like    spoiler This is the hidden textAs with the other usual method    This is the hidden textspoilerthere is no way to add links inside of those. So    spoiler Some text then a linksomelink. More textwont work. The text in quotes isnt parsed as markdown so the link doesnt get linkified. Similarly    Some text then a linksomelink. More textspoilerwont work because we cant nest links.Could you give some examples of what you would like to do?,csshelp,d68snmg,2,t5_2roaw
