Such requirements have been estimated to cost Americans . million jobs.According to the Institute for Justice which investigated the licensure requirements for  low to medium income jobs such as barbers and massage therapists on average licensure requirements force aspiring workers to spend nine months in education or training pass one exam and pay more than  in fees.The report states that one third of the licenses take more than a year to earn.Progress is being made with reforms like those passed in Minnesota however we are also seeing setbacks around the country such as the recent Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision which upheld a ban on the use of LED lights by nonlicensed dentists to whiten teeth and occupational licensure continues to be a littleknown issue.Hopefully people will notice the positive economic impact of loosened regulations in the food industry and others and the White Houses report will encourage bipartisan interest in eliminating barriers to working starting a small business and making a living.,HomeBusiness,ctyn9rp,1,t5_2ra3j
