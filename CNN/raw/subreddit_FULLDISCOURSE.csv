10553744,0,t3_5r3p9x,Some people are simply beyond reason and are not hardly worth the conversation.Most Trump supporters are either in denial about his history of hate and like to worship him as the savior of the American working class or they too are bigots and think that minorities and women need to get over it. Occasionally you can reason with these people but other times theyll disregard you and call you a commie SJW cuck.Again not every Trump supporter is like that and its a good idea to try to start a decent conversation about the impact his movement truly has on minorities and the working class as a whole.,FULLDISCOURSE,dd4dw7w,9,t5_3hvuu
10567903,0,t1_dd5v8qz,I couldnt agree more actually. We really need to engage in a campaign of dialogue with a lot of people even those who might appear as enemies at first.

10955129,0,t1_de9wzxs,So the society is still capitalist... but in their purest form are cooperatives not socialism since the productive relations within the cooperative are socialist? The cooperative as a whole is subject to capitalist relations but each worker is not subject to these to the extent that workers in other corporations are. I understand it cant be socialism if they are still subject to perverse production relations but would the enterprise in of itself not count as socialist?,FULLDISCOURSE,de9xzbg,3,t5_3hvuu
10955298,0,t1_de9xzbg,No they are not because socialism isnt a form of management but a mode of production that transcends capitalism. You cant have islands of socialism within capitalism. Cooperative enterprises utilise the capitalist mode of production.,FULLDISCOURSE,de9ylvs,8,t5_3hvuu

11540690,0,t3_64fnll,I support preventing American interests from overtaking Syria but never the purification of Assads image in the process. I strongly believe any leftist alliance should be one of necessity against imperial forces and his hateful farright principles should be held at an arms length and not celebrated even ironically during this time.I realize that ironic heroworship is a longstanding FULLCOMMUNISM tradition but growing up and leaving channer communities behind made me realize how dangerous irony can be if it is used irresponsibly. There are positive leftist qualities that redeem Mao Stalin etc. to enough of an extent to be celebrated but I do not see Assad in such a way. I come to FULLCOMMUNISM to jerk about leftism and seeing a farright leader plastered everywhere is upsetting.,FULLDISCOURSE,dg450lo,2,t5_3hvuu
