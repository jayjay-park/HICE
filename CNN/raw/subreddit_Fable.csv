2162330,0,t3_2ji5sv,Id love a Fable . where we play as a hero during the fall of the Guild. Give it the game mechanic feel of  for the most part but with more skillspell complexity like was available in  Blades was so much cooler in  and I miss my multishot. Bows would be back and awesome. Guns would be brand new and gamechanging weapons but there would still be a lot of magic around. No landlording because it wouldnt really fit in with the plot most likely. Gold would still be used as currency but I think there would have to be another abstract currency like guild seals in a way but more like you gain the favor of other heroes or regular people and trade it for favors. We would bring back experience for hero skills because that just makes a fuckton more sense than the stupid road to rule.Itd be really different from the other games because the fall of the guild is established lore so the plot is playing out a huge bloody tragedy that fans of the series will know is coming but be powerless to stop. No big generic rise to power or saving the kingdom from an unholy terror. Just doing your best to save your friends and family from being murdered by the people you once swore to protect.It probably starts relatively close to what Theresa called the night the guild burned. Perhaps you are a new hero who has just joined the guild. You do a few quests learning game mechanics making moral choices and getting hints about the growing tension between heroes and muggles. Then one night there is a huge crowd outside the gates to the Guild and you have to fight your way out with a few allies that youve collected over the course of your short time at the guild having a small continually changing party throughout the game could be fun the choices you make effect their opinions of you and how the story progresses with them. As you escape you see your new home burned to the ground lots of new friends and companions dead within.The rest of the game you travel around Albion always in hiding from those who would seek to destroy you which is pretty much everyone. You are either a good hero who still saves people hoping that your heroic deeds will help to reverse Albions hatred of your kind or you can be evil and only help other heroes that you meet on the run leaving civilians to their dooms or what have you. I put good and evil in quotes because obviously these kinds of choices inherently inhabit a gray area of morality so every choice you make will have good and evil to it. No more black and white just the choices you make and how the effect the world for better and worse.I imagine their could be many possible endings depending on what you do and where you go. You could end up dead after being hunted and finally cornered by an angry mob. You could go into hiding in some kind of magical sanctuary where you decide to stay until the world has calmed down which probably means you die there while waiting but safe at least. You could be a vigilante who continues protecting Albion regardless of how much people despise you. Maybe you steal away on a ship and start a new guild on some other continent. Maybe you settle down with a nice muggle girl and never use your hero powers again for the safety of your family. Maybe youre captured and brought to trial at the arena I recall something about heroes getting executed there in the loreif youve been evil they kill you but if youve been good they give you the option to kill the rest of your party and live out the rest of your life in exile.The story would have to be incredibly nonlinear because I could see a lot of these endings coming fairly quickly or very late into the game. Everything would depend on where you go and what you do and in what order. If you go to a certain area early on or later in the game the situation and the social climate would be at different points in the progression of the story. For example if you come to a fork in the road and go left instead of right you miss out on saving a little girl from a pack of wolves but you meet a hero friend of yours who can be a valuable member of the party. If you save the girl her family gives you room and board for the night but your friend is captured and executed. If you are later captured perhaps that little girl and her family are there to testify on your behalf or maybe theyre all dead because an evil hero you chose to spare the life of burned their village to the ground. There are benefits and consequences to everything. You would always have to keep moving because people would always be hunting you.Also no glowing blue veins. They look stupid as shit and Im tired of looking at them.,Fable,cleojsr,3,t5_2s5sa

10406914,0,t1_dcnof08,Oh definitely. I wouldnt expect them to do anything but despawn. I mean realistically theyd have nowhere to go but back to their various homes. I just want to see if I can get them to survive the trip as Ive never bothered to try before. I used to just leave them in the courtyard fighting the guards.One thing did occur to me as I was freeing them just now though is it possible to complete the quest without picking your gear backup? Like maybe with a willheavy character? Because when you get out of your cell you dont have any weapons equipped and thats the only time other than childhood thats possible as far as I know.Another thing Im curious about is whether or not its possible to leave the bandits alive on the Abandoned Road outside of Twinblades Camp like it is in Greatwood Gorge. It didnt occur to me at the time I was there though so Ill have to look into that during my next playthrough.Edit Yeah the prisoners definitely despawn after the kraken.,Fable,dcnowfe,3,t5_2s5sa
