3843014,0,t1_cqu14vz,You are supposed to read each section of rules as it comes up. So you read the mission intro and all of the rules under it before the break for the next section. Similarly when an event triggers the Imperial player is obligated to read all of the rules for that section as well. The only exception to reading all of the rules is if the Imperial player gets to choose one of several options. In that case he or she only reads the option they chose.Its also worth mentioning that the rebels can ask to have things reread. Basically anything thats been read is public knowledge. The Imperial player only gets a slight edge from the secret knowledge as whenever it takes effect its immediately public.,ImperialAssaultTMG,cquc5my,1,t5_332u9

5318107,0,t3_3nswck,I feel like IA is incredibly dependent on the players understanding that the game is  a tactical movement game and  a fighting stuff game. The most important thing you can ever do is get powers that let you move better. Only stop to kill mobs when absolutely necessary.

5891795,0,t3_3oomlu,I think modifying IA to play as an RPG is a great idea! Youd have to have a group of players who were okay with having a small number of options when creating starting characters. In my experience there are a lot of players who actually like this. Youd also have to figure out how often the characters would level up... would it be after every mission or would you add an XP system? I think I would try to keep it as close to the core IA mechanics as possible but just open things up for more roleplaying and nonlinear adventures.,ImperialAssaultTMG,cxry5pi,1,t5_332u9

6667365,0,t1_d08todz,Right  its raw damage and not an attack so the doors  block doesnt apply.But make sure the door was a valid target for self destruct in that context. I think the FAQ clarified that the spaces which share an edge with a door are the only spaces adjacent to the door so since the droids ability deals damage only to adjacent figuresobjects the droid would have to be in one of those two spaces for self destruct to hit the door.Because of the way ranged attacks work against doors tracing LOS and counting range only to the space in front of the door instead of the door surface itself its a common mistake to think you can be adjacent to a door if youre adjacent to the space in front of the door the space which would be the target of a ranged attack.,ImperialAssaultTMG,d08you9,3,t5_332u9

8114764,0,t3_4qc2kk,Good writeup just two remarksSnowballinggt I felt like I snowballed early on especially with how cash strapped the Rebels were. All campaigns snowball so far they only differ in the catchup mechanics the side with on the losing end has to stop the ball from rolling. RtH has imho the best catchup mechanics for both sides making it the least snowbally campaign so far including both mini campaigns.I also snowballed and finished the game with  in the lead but still lost the last mission. Loku and MHD are just very strong in the RtH campaign.Threat MissionsBummer that you took them out. My only gripe is that one of them can effectively be completely countered by MHDs Bacta Radiator. Other than that they had some really neat mechancis homestead and the wampa one probably beeing the best.Also the story implications made my rebels feel like their decision on which side mission to chose mattered more than usual which is the point of the threat missions I think. I really think you shouldnt have thrown them out especially since the rewards from them are geared towards a very strong last horray from the rebels to see if they can win the last mission despite being down most of the campaign.,ImperialAssaultTMG,d4s68l7,2,t5_332u9

8562001,0,t1_d6biyjx,gt If a designer of the game acknowledges that the game has a snowball issue...then the game probably has a snowball issue.If losing  missions in a row something that will happen on average  of the time all else being equal causes a significant issue with the game then the game is completely busted. Do you think the game is busted or do you think the designer was just being nice and trying to help someone that was having other issues without pointing out theyre losing because theyre simply not as good as their opponent? Its not a snowball the game simply doesnt account for player skill.  If you play  matches of chess the better player will probably win all  games.  Was that a snowball?  Obviously not. If you insist theres a problem then just reverse the rewards give the loser the winner xpcreditinfluence reward and the winner the loser reward xpcreditinfluence.  But again if you think this fairly small difference is the reason for your win or loss youre just making excuses its not.,ImperialAssaultTMG,d6btsya,-2,t5_332u9
8611224,0,t1_d6g7b3g,For  Strain Mak gets  pierce on a gun that rolls  damage regularly.  Jyn can take an attack that deals an average of  damage.  Gaar can pay  strain to pretend to have a gun Gideon can pay  strain to wish he was any other hero.    Point is at the start of the game most hero abilities are awful. Virtually no one can hit  damage in a single attack.  That  damage it saves a whole action and thats only against low HP targets.    How about the  HP tank in Mission  of Hoth. That guy has extra defense reducing most heros to a  damage average.  With Loku you literally double damage output saving you anywhere between  actions.No other hero can get that early level of action economy. Loku will deliver it every turn. A good Loku will save almost a quarter of total actions spent in any given mission.    I honestly feel sorry for groups who ignore early economy entirely to pick characters best suited to the midlate gameugh Gideon.  The game is made easy mode for the imperial which is no fun and he gets to snowball early on which is no fun.,ImperialAssaultTMG,d6hzzza,2,t5_332u9

Make this choice difficult and have a way to get your Trandoshans  in to close range.  You can do this with a tank. The bantha rider is a huge distraction and a great dealer of unmitigated damage. Replacing  Tran devious scheme  and headhunter will get you enough points to add one. You will want to have command cards for it.
