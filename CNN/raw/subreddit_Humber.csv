I have a few friends who are very talented musicians earned degrees from uni with high marks in music and now work at dead end jobs they despiseI love woodworking and my career path will allow me to pursue that hobby while working in an unrelated field with great opportunity that I really enjoy.Dont feel rushed and consider all your options,Humber,cfob7wa,1,t5_2suj2
