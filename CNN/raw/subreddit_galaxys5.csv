The side buttons look metal but theyre made of plastic and are sturdy with the case on. All the ports line up well except the top most left thing but only very very slightly. There is enough room for the earphone jack plugin a good slant to take your pulse on the back good room for your fingerprint and the perfect amount of room for your finger to pop the charger cover out. Ive dropped my phone already about  or  times from my lap in a truckcar to asphalt and all thats happened is the plastic ring around the rubber case got scuffed a little.    I got the Skinomi screen cover because of the good reviews and the lifetime warranty. Plus this is my first new phone in over  years previously had the Samsung Galaxy Captivate and Ive seen one too many people with cracked iPhones to not get a screen protector and a case. ,galaxys5,cjwh8h5,2,t5_2v73m

To be honest man its not that exciting now that I look back at all the time I spent modding the phone. Overclocking and undervolting my phones cpu did nothing to battery life for me or performance. The only reason I root android phones not is to delete all the added bloatware applications that cannot be uninstalled without root access. You dont have that problem with iOS you dont have those stupid ATampT type apps. The Nexus  G G and M blow the S out of the water for me.

2030403,0,t1_ckxwboz,Well I installed cyanogenmod but to be honest I keep coming back to TouchWiz. Its a lot better in terms of camera quality and features such as the fingerprint reader and the fact that cm runs the phone quite hot when I last tested it. Cm is and always will be awesome but I got the phone for some of the features such as private mode power and ultra power saving multi window SView extra touch sensitivity toolbox smart stay etc so why limit myself from them? Not to mention decreased battery life using cm.That said a factory reset will not help in any way. Personally the easiest way to root your phone is by using cf auto root. You can Google it. Basically you flash it via Odin it flashes a custom recovery automatically roots and installs superuser and then flashes back your stock recovery. Sadly this does trip Knox and voids your warranty. But at this stage towelroot is no longer an option.But the freedom that rooting gives you.. man I couldnt live without warranty be damned. This is why insurance exists. So if something stops working our phone accidentally falls. Yes unethical but its better than the alternative. Personally Ive never done that but its always a backup plan in case.But I mean with root you can block ads backup and restore apps easily use a root explorer install and use xposed modules that do things like automatically approve vpns  give you on screen navigation keys per app dpi call recording theme customization better privacy control for apps I use it for facebook and so on. The uses for root are damn near endless. Totally worth it imo if only for the adblocker. Total Freedom.,galaxys5,ckxwpvi,2,t5_2v73m

Textra on the other hand only lets you choose from limited color options. Personally Textras limited color options were enough to fit the rest of the theme of my phone so I didnt feel like I was missing out by switching over. In my opinion play around with Textras customization and see if you like it. If you do I highly recommend using Textra over Handcent due to the SMSMMS being better. ampnbspYou mentioned you dont use group messages much but personally Id rather have the capability to group message efficiently and not use it instead of not having it when you need it.

The recovery options mentioned are for use with custom recovery TWRP being the most popular but may not be possible for you depending on the model number. The Verizon and ATampT Ss cannot simply Odin flash TWRP because the bootloaders are locked.    If by chance the model has a unlocked bootloader and as a last resort you can get the proper version of TWRP Odin and flash TWRP in download mode. Once twrp is installed you can make a nandroid of the device and possibly dissect the nandroid on a desktop computer using zip to find her media files. Another option is to flash TWRP on a new S and restore the nandroid datamedia partition only.    The point is moot if the device wont stay in download mode to enter download mode pull the battery and reinsert. Now boot the device by pressing and holding volume down home power. You will see a warning about custom software pass it and see if the device holds download mode without shutting down for about  minutes. ,galaxys5,d50fqt6,1,t5_2v73m
8239003,0,t1_d56y1r7,Battery savers actually do more damage than they help. A lot of battery savers and task killers will tell you that those offending apps are running and slowing your system down when if you look closely the majority of those apps are cached or are doing nothing at all.What that means  First an app goes to sleep. Thats not a concept sleep is a defined running state. The app is in the background ready to go when you need it  but it is consuming zero power. Next comes cached. If an app sleeps long enough Android will take a really tiny snapshot of its state  a few dozen bytes  and get rid of the rest of it. Now that app is available on a moment and halfs notice. It takes no power and it takes a few bytes of ram  even if the app itself is megabytes it wont be in ram. Android has seen to that. And if its an app you run often dont be surprised to find the app cached after you boot your phone and havent done anything yet. Android is not stupid it remembers. Both sleeping and cached apps are said to be hibernating. Task killersBattery Savers identify them as running  theyre not. Then they claim to kill them. They do not. Then they claim performance increases. It can not. Hibernating apps are not running. Ram cleaners claim the same. They decode a few dozen bytes of cached apps that are not in memory calculate what the ram usage would be if they were erase a few dozen bytes and then claim to clean up all of that ram  that might get used in the future. Maybe. If you launch a cached app. They dont clean megabytes  they clean a few bytes and lie. Android is not stupid so it reloads the managed data  the automatic snake oil sees it and the cycle repeats. You go and check and it lies about all the good it does you. And at that point youre either being fed recurring ads or a sales pitch to go pro and pay for the lies or its data mining your personal info. Sometimes all of the above.source ,galaxys5,d57fjor,2,t5_2v73m

Performance has definitely improved and you can treat the SD card the same as internal I also got a bigger card so that helped too. I ran CM on my previous phones as well S before that Fascinate and much prefer it to TouchWiz.Ill likely be upgrading in November mainly because my contract with VZW will be up and Im anxious to move to a cheaper provider. Right now Im considering Google Fi and will likely either get the new Pixel or the Nexus x.,galaxys5,d8dfi4u,4,t5_2v73m
9180033,0,t1_d8fmnea,Perfect. You have the Samsung eMMC and not the Toshiba eMMC. Meaning the bootloader unlock exploit will work. Yes you will need to wipe. First you need to root. Follow this guide to do it. Tell me if you have any questions or when you finish it.,galaxys5,d8fmwzp,2,t5_2v73m

And the best thing is battery life and performance I was going down to  but now after using it for  hours I am still at . And it no longer lags.
