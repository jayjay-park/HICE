The basic airframe is manufactured by Lockheed while Boeing is responsible for the conversion into a gunship and for aircraft support. The ACA Gunship II superseded the AC Gunship I during the Vietnam WargtThe gunships sole user is the United States Air Force which uses ACH Spectre ACU Spooky ACJ Ghostrider and ACW Stinger II variants for close air support air interdiction and force protection Close air support roles include supporting ground troops escorting convoys and flying urban operations. Air interdiction missions are conducted against planned targets and targets of opportunity. Force protection missions include defending air bases and other facilities. ACUs are based at Hurlburt Field Florida while ACHs and ACWs are based at Cannon AFB New Mexico The ACs deploy to bases worldwide in support of operations. The gunship squadrons are part of the Air Force Special Operations Command AFSOC a component of the United States Special Operations Command SOCOM.gtAll of the weaponry aboard is mounted to fire from the left port side of the nonpressurised aircraft. During an attack the gunship performs a pylon turn flying in a large circle around the target allowing it to fire at it far longer than a conventional attack aircraft. The ACH Spectre was armed with two mm M Vulcan cannons two Bofors mm autocannoncitation needed and one mm M cannon although on most missions after  the  mm cannons were removed due to their incompatibility with precision targeting and to carry more  mm and  mm ammunition. Another reason the  mm cannons were removed was due to insufficient slant range to target to operate outside of the shoulder launched missile MANPADS threat envelope. The upgraded ACU Spooky has a single mm GAU Equalizer in place of the Spectres twin mm cannons an improved fire control system and increased ammunition capacity. New ACJ gunships based on MCJ Combat Shadow II special operations tankers were planned as of updateen.wikipedia.orgwindex.php?titleLockheedACampactionedit.

Let me just take a few comments from it in an attempt to convince you its not a good thing to be sharing with anyone meaningful.gt Secondly I have spent tens of thousands of dollars going to school because it was made very clear that that was the preferred and at times only method of becoming an air traffic controllerIf your second argument for why something should change is I spent a bunch of money on it youve lost me already.gtThirdly explicitly considering applicants on the basis of race national origin or gender and especially when doing so instead of on the basis of their relevant educational background or aptitude test scoresis not only discriminatory but potentially dangerous insomuch as it aims to diversify a workforce by looking at nonrelevant traits before and instead of those which have been shown over and over to matter significantly.I only want to comment on the last bit but I cant because it wouldnt make sense of how many unnecessary commas theyve used. The thing is it hasnt been shown to matter. There are OTS hires that have turned out to be fantastic controllers and CTI students that have turned out to be complete and utter ass as soon as they start talking to real planes. I want to believe that CTI students wash out less than OTS or even VRA hires but theres no data to back it up. Believe me if there was UND and Riddle wouldnt let us forget about it. gtThe new hiring scheme is clearly targeted at meeting racial quotas which otherwise known as racism is patently immoral and quite likely impermissible.Quite likely impermissible! Ruh roh! As Ive said in another comment above please dont toss my opinions out the window here as that of some jaded controller sick of dealing with CTI kids.

530632,0,t3_207rmk,There will definitely not be any cumuliform clouds at FL unless theyre thunderstorms.  The strongest thunderstorms over the North Atlantic would be lucky to reach FL.   Clear air turbulence also wont be a factor at FL since thats deep within the stratosphere at temperate latitudes and the atmosphere there is naturally stable.Its a little different in the tropics such as flying the route to Rio de Janeiro.  The Concorde might actually remain in the top of the troposphere in the tropics and be more susceptible to turbulence.  Benign storms can reach well past FL in the tropics but the Concorde would have used radar avoidance.  During planning a route would have been laid out that avoided any obvious or persistent clusters of storms.  Satellite coverage of the tropics was excellent after .That said the effect of turbulence on a plane is inversely proportional to wing loading weight of the airplane divided by the wing area and with its high wing loading ratio  kgm  compared to a B  kgm  the Concorde is much less susceptible to turbulence than most aircraft.Source Am in atmospheric sciences NOT so much aeronautical engineering.,aviation,cg0l8un,20,t5_2qhu8

570612,0,t3_20nxyn,Roughly speaking imagine the transponder as listening for an signal that says squawk your code.  The transponder transmits is set squawk code and the controllers software aligns the radar track with that code.  The more frequent the interrogation the more squawking.  It should also contain altitude information.So if you have radar info and the transponder stops working you will lose the altitude information from the transponder.  Apparently the transponder was turned off at the handover in airspace so the new controller never assigned a new squawk code but the radar data should have continued to show the return signal minus the squawk.As for ACARS the question is at what interval the data are sent automatically from the  to the ground.  The confusion arises that if you have  minutes say between transmissions you dont know when the system is turned off exactly just that it failed to report in the window between the last and next scheduled report.So you have.  Last transmission and failed handoff.  Last squawk and loss of squawk .

Many aircraft can fly without flap canoes for example  those are the long fairings that cover the flap tracks beneath and aft of the wing. Typically the CDL Configuration Deviation List lets you know exactly what can be missing and gives specific instructions on what must be done to fly without various exterior parts. It almost never requires this type of text though. Typically the aircraft logbook has a damage list attached with any missing parts listed in the MELCDL section.To be honest this looks more like a special temporary repair performed under an engineering order though.

If you now add all the trucks from catering  cleaning  toilet and fresh water services  and then add our machines and all the trailers and dollies there really is not a lot of room to maneuver it all.It takes a lot of people to perfectly handle it and all ramps are understaffed because flying is too cheap and taxes too high.The a has the inconvenience of having a step up in the bulk. So you should be two people loading and unloading it but its too tiny for that. So you really get no workflow.The aft compartment has a tunnel. This means it gets narrower towards the wings. So you have to load the PMCs into the plane and rotate them  inside the plane so that they fit. The door is too narrow to load them rotated so you lose time and rythm.Checked cabin baggage like baby strollers have to be picked up via two flights of stairs and through two locked doors.The ber takes more freight than the  this means you can get a couple tons more into the air on less limited space.

You may need a lot of power to get moving from a standstill.  Since  engine will be at twice the power of  engines youll produce twice the amount of jet blast all conentrated in one area.  When taxing around crowed areas near the terminal the more thrust you use the higher chances of you damaging something with the jet blast blowing stuff over behind the aircraft.  The one engine will also be sucking in more air which increases the chances of foreign object debris FOD damage.  i.e. sucking up little rocks screws or random things laying on the ground on the taxiways and aprons.  This will increase maintenance costs over time.Pretty much all US airlines have a single engine taxi policy minus a few.  However some foreign airlines operate in countries where long taxi delays are not common do not practice less than all engine taxing because the taxi time is so short.  ,aviation,cgnlzkx,2,t5_2qhu8

When we visited the Brevoort station it was pretty much as the last workers left it. There were paperbacks in the lounge dishware and cutlery in the kitchen and tonnes of partially stripped out electronic gear.The town of Frobisher Bay now Iqaluit was able to salvage a working  tonne truck from there.

1335739,0,t1_cijfuuo,Regardless of whether were talking about ultralights a helicopter or light aircraft crash is going to fuck up a lot more than a drone would.gt So lets wait until it happens bury the dead and then introduce regulations? There have been more near misses than that this was just the one so far that involved an airliner. The amount of drones being used especially over public events is increasing all the time. The first to die will be a helicopter pilot probably in a news helicopter.No you run with the laws used everywhere else in the world and forbid model aircraft from flying above ft. If an idiot is willing to fly an aircraft outside of his permitted airspace you charge him the same way you would charge a pilot if he illegally flew into Class A airspace.And in addition you wait a couple of years for transponder technology to catch up and then mandate that all model aircraft in excess of lb use such a transponder. Military unmanned aircraft have been operating in skies around the world since . You also forget that all closecalls with drones have been with drones operated via visual line of sight control not FPV or autonomous control.gt That is ridiculous and would never ever happen. Im not even going to go into the whole idea that a  year old could be considered a commercial operator but driving passengers in your car for compensation or hire is also illegal and do you ever see anyone arrested for taking his friends to the bar in exchange for some free beer? The FAA is going after people who operate remote controlled aircraft commercially the same way they do for manned aircraft.I admit the  year old case is extremely unlikely but the law still does not differentiate and in other cases such as where UAVs have been used safely and extremely successfully to perform search and rescue the FAA has attempted to shut down these pilots because the company that requested the pilots charity via service was sometimes given money. Heres an article about the company challenging the order and heres a  minute video by the company on what has happened.gtwont be able to make a living flying RC planes at airshows anymoreExcept no one is doing this other than those that are big enough to become commercial operators. I challenge you to find me one noncommercial operator that has been found to be surviving off their RC  UAV operation.gt Having seen first hand what a soft kg Canada Goose does to a  I say kgs is WAY too high. A kg drone could take out even an airliner if it hit the right spot. Id put the limit at above kg when above ft and any such aircraft would also have to have a reliable way to measure altitude. Anything above kg or so would need to be transponder equipped when over ft at least when in controlled airspace. The issue here is that without licensing the majority of UAV operators would have no idea where that controlled airspace is especially when it is Class E.Youre confusing the two topics at hand. A hobby operator does have several laws to abide by already but they can operate their aircraft for free. A commercial operator is different in that they are required to undergo aviation and proficiency examinations and gain a license all of which costs several thousands of dollars. They then have more responsibility but also the same potential freedom as a manned pilot.A hobby pilot right now is already meant to stay below ft. The majority of pilots who violate these laws dont actually even know much about rc aircraft let alone aviation laws and therefore wouldnt even know what a commercial operators license is.The majority of people that do fly FPV beyond of line of sight have spent a lot of time and effort researching and designing their transmission systems maximising the cruise efficiency of their system etc. For your typical FPV flyer you cant operate outside of line of sight due to the design limitations of things like a DJI Phantom.,aviation,cijvxz1,0,t5_2qhu8

2035548,0,t3_2i3wsk, An excerpt from the book Sled Driver by former SR pilot Brian Shulgt There were a lot of things we couldnt do in an SR but we were the fastest guys on the block and loved reminding our fellow aviators of this fact. People often asked us if because of this fact it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane. Intense maybe even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there at least for a moment.gt It occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed  hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts  feet below us I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was finally after many humbling months of simulators and study ahead of the jet.gt I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat. There he was with no really good view of the incredible sights before us and tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions and when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult too for me to relinquish control of the radios as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground however. Walt was so good at many things but he couldnt match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him. The predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center far below us controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope albeit briefly we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace.gt We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a readout of his ground speed. Center replied November Charlie  Im showing you at ninety knots on the ground. Now the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One they always spoke in the exact same calm deep professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the Houston Center voice. I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this countrys space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didnt matter what sector of the country we would be flying in it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely over the years pilots always wanted to ensure that when transmitting they sounded like Chuck Yeager or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios.gt Just moments after the Cessnas inquiry a Twin Beech piped up on frequency in a rather superior tone asking for his ground speed in the Beech. I have you at one hundred and twentyfive knots of ground speed. Boy I thought the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren.gt Then out of the blue a navy F pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. Center Dusty  ground speed check. Before Center could reply Im thinking to myself hey Dusty  has a ground speed indicator in that milliondollar cockpit so why is he asking Center for a readout? Then I got it ol Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. Hes the fastest dude in the valley today and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply always with that same calm voice with more distinct alliteration than emotion Dusty  Center we have you at  on the ground. And I thought to myself is this a ripe situation or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still I thought it must be done in mere seconds well be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn.gt Somewhere  miles above Arizona there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. Then I heard it the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally and with no emotion Walter spoke Los Angeles Center Aspen  can you give us a ground speed check? There was no hesitation and the replay came as if it was an everyday request.gt Aspen  I show you at one thousand eight hundred and fortytwo knots across the ground. I think it was the fortytwo knots that I liked the best so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say in his most fighterpilotlike voice Ah Center much thanks were showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.gt For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice when L.A. came back with Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one. It all had lasted for just moments but in that short memorable sprint across the southwest the Navy had been flamed all mortal airplanes on frequency were forced to bow before the King of Speed and more importantly Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine days work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.If you enjoyed that story check out the subreddit dedicated to the Blackbird rSR,aviation,ckyka1m,-1,t5_2qhu8

In fact rebuilding the shuttle after each flight was more expensive than just building a oneshot rocket from scratch.Things that offset the theoretical benefit of not needing to carry oxygen for some portion of the flight include but are not limited to The weight of the precooler. This is no laughing matter. In the video he talks about just one tonne but with all the liquid helium and supporting equipment Im very sceptical this can be done. Reusable engines are heavier than oneshot engines Reusable engines are more expensive to build than oneshot engines.Again Im totally fascinated by the SABRE engine concept and the precooler works in principle.

So theres an extra step of making sure the right frequency is selected on the radio in addition to selecting the right radio.I made a mistake like this last weekend flying RHVgtPAO which involves talking to four towers in a very short time span transitioning through SJC and NUQ airspace. This particular C has two radios installed so I programmed all four frequencies in before taking off. Switching from NUQ to PAO I toggled COM to PAOs frequency but forgot that I had been talking to NUQ on COM and didnt switch to COM so I ended up announcing my position and requesting landing clearance while still on Moffetts frequency.,aviation,cnrdfpj,1,t5_2qhu8

Visibility requirement in class Echo above  feet is  statute miles  below  above and  sm horizontally.

This means that if one pilot goes full right and the other goes full left then the instructions are cancelled out and the plane remains wings level. If both pilots move their sidesticks simultaneously a Dual Input warning is given.

I tell most people to plan on  hours just as a good safe buffer so you can figure the entire private pilot will cost you somewhere in the neighborhood of . You will finish under that cost almost  of the time but its better to expect the worse.Additional costs are in charts AFDs etc. But that should cost no more than an additional  over the time of the rating.

The A isnt a full sized  but the new AHGW or IGW is being built to replace  fleets. The variation fromt he A to the A and similarly from the  to the er is quite big really requires they have their own data point. the  should be on there even though its not going to be very prolific it is quite different from the s. The As filled a very important role there was a big range restriction back then on twin jets when ETOPS ratings were very low the A family seemed a great idea and they did their job well however they are now largely obsolete with most new jets getting ETOPS ratings above  minutes there arent many routes left that require more than twin jets and those that do are served by higher capacity jets in general that offer better performance.

Deicing stops and we end up waiting for a while with no reason. Pilot comes on a few minutes later announcing that theres still ice on the wing and he doesnt feel safe flying it. The deicing crew would take too long to get back before the airport closed so the flight was cancelled. The pilots and I both knew that  times out of  that flight could have gone off without a hitch even with a little ice on the wings but they still cancelled it anyways just to be safe.Long story short Pilots cancelled a flight full of anxious and agitated passengers that had been on the plane for hours because of a minor safety risk.

It was always better when the wind was right and planes were landing because they were much lower and you could make out so much detail on them. For a while the Caledonian Airways Tristar was my favourite coz it looked so different to the rest but then one day... Concorde arrived. I dont know exactly what age I was probably around  so it was the early s. I never knew it beforehand but it was scheduled to visit for some reason it very rarely did and I was staying with my grandfolks for the weekend. I just remember being outside and suddenly hearing this astonishing noise unlike the sound of any other jet that had cruised over before and Ill never forget the moment it came into view over a rooftop. It wouldve only been a couple of thousand feet up at most and it completely blew my tiny mind to smithereens. The shape the nose pointing down at an angle and that sound... Against a blue sky it looked like some kind of roaring mechanical angel was descending from the heavens.I just stood and stared and wished one day that Id get to fly in it.

3491253,0,t1_cpq7g0b,Well heres the deal. Theres three AoA sensors. Two of them are telling the computer that the plane is banked up at . degrees. One is functioning correctly and indicating that the plane is level. The computer assumes that the two AoA sensors that have failed are correct since the difference between them and the correct AoA sensor is too large. So the computer assumes that the correct sensor is wrong since it deviates too far from the other two sensors.gt The third AOA sensor operating correctly now started showing conflicting values and the flight computer disregarded this value as incorrect since it was programmed to consider two similar values as the correct values.,aviation,cpq87ob,10,t5_2qhu8

3496568,0,t1_cpqredr,No generally the autopilot will not automatically do things it has not been told it is supposed to do by the pilots. Obviously the line drawn gets a little bit fuzzy but the general idea is that automatic functions dont have sufficient context to make a good decision in an emergency and the risk that they make a potentiallyrecoverable emergency into an even worse outcome is too high. For example if the plane was above a violent thunderstorm or if there was another plane flying at the flight levels below an automatic emergency descent could make the situation worse and into a very real and unrecoverable disaster while the pilots are still trying to figure out whats going on and get their oxygen masks put on. The system is intentionally biased towards trusting pilot decisionmaking over automatic responses. Often there will be automatic detection of problems providing audio visual or tactile cues to the pilots but only with extreme rarity will an automatic function actually be allowed to respond beyond simply attempting to alert the pilot.It does look like a controlled descent though and my suspicion is that the pilots were able to set the autopilot to initiate the emergency descent before losing consciousness. And for whatever reason they apparently never regained consciousness once the plane made it to lower altitudes perhaps because mere oxygen deprivation was not their only problem smoke inhalationfire? or perhaps because there was simply not enough time and not thick enough oxygen due to the mountainous terrain being at such a high altitude. So the autopilot followed its settings and flew the plane exactly as it had been configured to do. Even if it had disconnected when it detected the rapidly approaching terrain or if the pilots had come to it likely wasnt enough. With the missing flight data recorder we might never know if the autopilot or the pilots did come to and realize their proximity to the ground and attempted in vain to recover but it was obviously too late by that point. With mountains you get into a situation where the terrain ahead can rise faster than your plane can and then its basically game over. Mountains are not a forgiving environment for airplanes.,aviation,cpqu1cs,3,t5_2qhu8

3575277,0,t1_cpvqjwv,Come on Robbie this has been explained to you already  as you know planes are tested to be known to be safe within the specified limits  No one besides maybe test pilots knows exactly what would happen to the  planes or indeed any airliner when they exceed those limits Its a risk but there is nothing that says they would immediately have had problems.  Its perfectly possible that they would fly well for some time before anything happens.  Again exceeding the V limits increases risk but theres no assumption of immediate problems being caused the second you exceed.  Other pilots have explained to you that the limits are set with safety margins so the plane is in fact likely to be fine for some time above those limits.  Incidentally Its not informative to get examples of types of aircraft not used on . Thats like trying to understand a BMW by looking at a Mercedes.    And if you were really interested in proving the planes on  shouldnt have been able to achieve the speeds measured only by lessthanaccurate ssr ground radar then its very simple to prove  thrust needed to achievesustain those speeds  max thrust capable from the engines on the planes.

3793172,0,t1_cqomchz,I can comment on two of these.  I did my training at Redbird its a good place.  And later I rented from George Farris at Above amp Beyond Aviation and he seemed like a good guy and good instructor.  Redbird normally charges a fixed price for all of your PPL training  around k no matter how many hours it takes you while most other schools charge per hour.  This may sound appealing but I learned during my training that the instructors get a bonus if you finish your training it a certain number of hours like  or something.  After I finished my training and rented a plane I went to refuel once and realized I had no idea how to refuel the plane safely.  I know that refueling isnt an FAA requirement but it seems kind of lame to not go over it at least once.  In other words as a student you should want as much training as you can get for your money.  But at Redbird the instructors have incentive to get you out with fewer hours of training.  It seems like the incentives arent aligned right.  That said Id still recommend the place  just dont be pressured to rush through your training if youve paid the fixed price.,aviation,cqonh9n,4,t5_2qhu8

3935020,0,t1_cr4o2hm,. No because shortly after entering As were confined within  miles of Kuwait due to their losses while Fs etc flew across all of Iraq.. They fly higher and faster making it harder to hit and the Fs reduced RCS makes it even harder to hit with a MANPAD.. Its not... Fs are already m cheaper than Fs. By full production theyll be the same price as a bock  FFA. Even with costing more upfront the logistics for the F actually saves some T compared to what we have now including the A.. Correct and all gun runs are inaccurate which is the reason behind SDBII.. Its the only mission it can do so Id hope it did a lot of them... but fact is that mutiroles did it more often.. And so can every other combat aircraft meaning the A isnt a special snowflake.. Depends on the range actually. Due to the Fs insanely large fuel capacity and internal stores it can actually loiter for a while if needed.

And no not all close in engagements are going to result in traditional dogfights.  But once in close an aircraft that cant maneuver is in major trouble.  A missile truck that cant turn climb etc with the enemy isnt going to last long.The F isnt the best example since it is a software issue that is preventing the use or the AIM.  Its a bug not a feature.  And the F well that was  years for the AIMX not earlier variants.  It carried AIML and M models before. And if the USAF shared your view wed still see aircraft like the Phantom being developed not aircraft that put a higher priority on maneuvering and performance such as the teen series the F and though it doesnt seem to be panning out as well with the F.

This is a very expensive way to go about things and was almost certainly going to result in a difficult birth so to speak but the country and company doing it has deep pockets and proven history on doing projects on or under budget respectively. As for the aircraft it is stealth capable and air to air combat is now about beyond visual range combat hardly ever dogfights. I snipe you before you even see me sort of thing.

5553369,0,t1_cwl2vo2,This is all utter speculation admittedly with some informed guessing but....The tail can become separated for other reasons than a bomb or sudden explosive decompression... the reports say that the pilot had said he had engine trouble and was diverting for an approach to Cairo Interfax says he declared an emergency and requested a diversion to El Arish airport on Egypts border with the Gaza strip in Palestine so whatever happened didnt happen catastrophically in a single moment but the crew at least for a while were in control of the aircraft during the incident.Flightradars track information which I accept can be glitchy at the best of times shows the flight climbing to  ft at  kn then making a sudden and rapid descent to  ft at  kn before ceasing to send out the positionaltitudespeed transponder data that Flightradar uses. A descent at well below stall speed Knots at that height is definitely below stall for a supercritical wing like that of the A suggests a deep stall.... the aerodynamic forces during a sustained deep stall can rip apart the control surfaces. Thus my total speculation of a guess at this moment would go for pilots having engine trouble and loss of thrust but continued to k ft where the flight envelope is much narrower and whilst working the engine problem and its resultant impact on instrumentation etc. did not maintain speed or attitude in the dark over the Sinai and entered a deep stall to which they then didnt respond quickly enough or like the AF crash didnt interpret properly and did the wrong thing like pitch up not down until the point at which recovering from the stall was past with aerodynamic forces ripping the tail away from the rest of the aircraft. There are problems with this I accept  like how can they miss the stall alarm etc. but I guess with an engine fire or similar they may have already been dealing with multiple alarms.But that is just a guess at this stage... a bombs possible an explosive decompression is possible I guess we will have to wait and see what the FDR amp CVR show.,aviation,cwlg2az,2,t5_2qhu8

Alternatively they can run the air start but not actually turn on the fuel and the engine will just spin. These engines are started by spinning them up with compressed air then when they reach the correct pressure they add fuel and the ignition system lights it up.

6604784,0,t3_4653y3,For those who follow SpaceX  rockets its very familiar how any decision that helps drop weight has a sometimes exponential effect reduce weight in one place and you reduce the need to carry that weight somewhere else which reduces the weight of that piece and so on. In a sense a weight reduction goes into a kind of feedback loop ... where adding weight is a vicious cycle losing weight is a virtuous one.With that in mind these decisions seem to be key only bringing enough power to make it most of the way to the destination ... thus reducing the battery size   related adding a regenerative motor which generates power during the descent thus adding enough power to deal with weather air traffic or other causes of a longer flight   using a flight profile that calls for climbing to altitude well most planes do this anyway as its the most efficient for both conventional and electric planes  Im not saying these are all the right decisions but theyre compelling all the same and they might be a part of what Musk is considering. I like how he explains the thinkinggt As an emerging technology electric flight is full of new ideas as well as a lot of old ideas that need to be forgotten. Weve attacked one of these old ideas in our design throwing away the concept that an electric plane has to have enough battery capacity to get where it is going. Remember Steve Jobs saw as his design strength always asking why things were done the way they were.

6989137,0,t3_4bd8ho,Where were you flying? This almost sounds like a wake turbulence encounter which is something usually encountered when landing or taking off but can happen sometimes happen at cruise.If your aircraft was flying behind and below another jet or crossed the path where an aircraft had recently passed through you can expect a few jolts  normally they are different to regular turbulence as the wake is rotating so you can sometimes get a large wing drop.Alternately if you were flying near some mountains you may have encountered wave turbulence  I was recently in a Q that did something similar over some mountains.And of course it can just be plain old regular clear air turbulence!The pilots probably wouldnt have corrected it as the aircrafts autopilot is comfortably able to deal with nearly all turbulence. Its completely safe just disconcerting and uncomfortable. ,aviation,d18k6f8,2,t5_2qhu8
6990155,0,t3_4bf1nl,There are a few issues with this.  First is that the type of engines from the A or  are really the wrong sort of engine for supersonic flight.  Highbypass turbofans produce thrust by moving a tremendous mass of air at a relatively slow average speed as opposed to turbojets or even lowbypass turbofans which move a smaller mass of air at a far higher average speed.  The lower average exhaust speed makes them far more efficient at the subsonic speeds at which airliners normally fly but it limits how fast they can actually push something.   The second is the aerodynamics.  Supersonic flow is a different beast than subsonic flow and it requires different designs.  The supercritical airfoils used in airliners are designed specifically for flight at transonic speeds and wouldnt perform well in supersonic flight.   The long highaspect ratio wings used by airliners really do not work well for supersonic flight theyd be outside of the main shock wave and the stresses are certainly far greater than they were designed for.  The nose would have to be redesigned so the shock it produced wouldnt hit the rest of the airplane.  Nothing is built to withstand the greater forces and nothing is built to accommodate the shocks you get when you break the sound barrier.  Oh and supersonic flight means your airplane will get very hot which isnt something normal airliners are designed to deal with.Also jet engines dont do particularly well when they ingest supersonic air.   Thats why supersonic aircraft have things like intake ramps and shock cones they need something to slow down the incoming air.   An engine just sitting in a pod below the wing like in airliners would run into problems at supersonic flight.The fixes for these things arent minor or easy which is why supersonic transport aircraft are all designed from scratch.  You might be able to take a piece or two from existing airliners and adapt it but basing it on an existing airframe would require so many fundamental redesigns that itd be more hinderence than help.,aviation,d18och4,5,t5_2qhu8

The refuelling ability was also stripped from both the M and M and is visible in the preSALT M footage. The M moved to a wedge intake ramp like the F and MiG upgraded NK engines that greatly increased thrust increased overall wing sweep ability and a new radar and navattack system both of which allowed it greater lowlevel penetration capabilities. The TuM would be the version most commonly armed with the widely identified AS KitchenKh while the TuM would be the strike version of the TuM and carried an internal rotary launcher of short range nuclear missilesKh similar to the AGM SRAM. Especially when coupled with the radar and fire controlnavagation upgrades of the M modification. The TuM can still carry the Kh however and does now that the TuM is out of service.Only the TuM remains in service. Previously...

7777160,0,t1_d3n6v5t,gt Is there a neutral or balanced evaluation of the F anywhere online?Youre not really going to get one because its a huge project and thus attracts controversy and once you look into it you form an opinion one way or another. Not to mention theres a whole cottage industry of bloggers and journalists who crap on U.S. military programs arguing that the U.S. shouldnt spend so much on its wizbang military gadgets like the F which are completely overkill for shooting up camels in the Middle East while simultaneously also arguing that the U.S.s wizbang military gadgets should be cancelled because they suck too much and are already obsolete. So you have to wade through a lot of garbage to find some useful information.The most you can really do is to just look at the articles and analyses you find and ask yourself how credible is this article how well is it sourced i.e. is it just assertions like the F sucks or the F rocks or does it actually back up its claims with citations and other sources and probably most importantly how credible are the sources and do they back up the claims. Essentially you have to work out how objective the author is being yourself  how well they are able to cite authoritative sources such as official reports and such as opposed to just linking to other websites saying the same thing theyre saying how well their arguments are supported by the evidence they provide how well they provide the context for their arguments for example if they say its really good or really bad do they give an applestoapples comparison to other planes so you can judge for yourself just how good or bad it is? and so forth.Its made more difficult because  as you state  the discussion is very polarized particularly because a lot of the news these days is not really traditional journalism the way we think of it  investigate something gather the facts report the facts report the conclusions we can draw from them etc.  but advocacy where the author already has a conclusion in mind a narrative a story whatever and goes out looking for evidence to justify it. So its important to consider not just how valid the evidence they present is but also what evidence might be there that they didnt present that would contradict their position. Additionally because lots of news articles these days is really just relinking what other websites have posted with very little original content its easy to see an article from Reuters or wherever and think its their own content based on their own standards of journalism rather than noticing that theyre just linking to more advocacytype websites like War is Boring FoxtrotAlpha etc. Because of the latter you also cant rely on whats true or not based on how many times you see a story being reported just because you see the same story being reported on different media sites does not mean they independently did their own investigations. A prime example of this is a supposed F vs F dogfight you may have heard about which all started from a single blogger David Axe who deliberate took quotes out of context from a software test report to make it seem like the two planes were dogfighting when the reports own first sentence curiously omitted from Axes article said the purpose was to check the Fs software parameters.If youre looking for information about the F again everybody will have their own opinion. I invite you to look at how wellreasoned they can back up their opinion versus just engaging in generalities Its the bestest thing ever or ad hominem attacks youre just a LM shill or an idiot. For me personally Im not proF so much as Im antiantiF I started posting on Reddit about the F because I got sick of all the antiF stupidity out there when I was researching the F. Some examples The F vs F dogfight David Axe claimed that a leaked test report said a F lost to a F in a dogfight test. When he initially wrote the article he didnt actually provide the test report but instead just took quotes out of context so those quotes were all people had to go on. When people started calling BS on it he finally released the test report several days later after his initial article was already being reported and relinked far and wide. It turns out that the first sentence of the test report said that the objective was to test how the Fs control laws handled at high angle of attack  in other words to test the Fs software control laws and parameters. Even so people will still claim to this day that the F cant dogfight due to this article. In contrast pilots have noted that a combatloaded F will outperform a combatloaded F and a Norwegian pilot has mentioned that the F  thanks to its maneuverability and its ability to stay in control including at high angles of attack  can be much more aggressive and take the offensive position early and can reverse a defensive position into an offensive position quickly. In other words it will be a pretty competent dogfighter.  RAND report. This and the whole F vs F dogfight business is what pissed me off and got me started posting on Reddit about the F. David Axes War is Boring site continues to claim that a  RAND simulation showed that the F would be blown out of the sky by Chinese Flankers. See here for example. If you look at the report however youll see that its taking a worstcase scenario to make the point that the U.S. should still focus on having enough numbers rather than just rely on technological superiority. To make its case the authors assumed that a surprise Chinese first strike destroyed U.S. bases in the area and  Chinese Flankers were heading to Taiwan leaving the U.S. with a small amount of planes to defend Taiwan. What basically happens is that the U.S. planes fire all their missiles but enough Flankers survive to launch their missiles at the U.S. planes and destroy them. Note that I didnt distinguish between Fs and Fs here  because the report didnt either. The simulation was literally an Excel spreadsheet which didnt differentiate between Fs and Fs other than that Fs carried  missiles each while Fs carried  missiles each. Chinese missiles were assumed equally effective against either plane it had a probability of kill simply against U.S. planes without differentiating against which kind. As a side note it also assumed that Chinese missiles against the U.S. planes were just as effective as American missiles against the nonstealth Chinese Flankers they had the same probability of kill despite stealth differences in training differences in tactics differences in technology etc. Does this sound right to anybody? Yet they make it seem as if the simulation proved the F would lose. Note that David Axe gracefully elides over what happens to the Fs in his flowery description of the Excel spreadsheets results. . trillion dollar cost. This is reported all over the media. What they dont report is that this is the projected cost of the whole F program from its beginnings in  all the way out to the year  including inflation and including operating and support OampS costs which is not included for just about every other program. For example when Wikipedia says the Fs total program cost is . billion it does not include the OampS cost but only RampD and procurement. For the F RampD and procurement works out to around  billion out to the year  including inflation for  planes. Each F is basically half the cost of each F. The program will cost roughly  billion per year when the defense budget is currently around  billion per year and we currently spend around . trillion per year in Social Security unemployment and labor. The media just wants to slap the trillion label on a military program. F payload. People will get this wrong all the time. The F is designed to be able to carry  lb of weapons internally in a stealth configuration. A lot of people will compare this with the payload of say a Super Hornet  lb to say the F has a pitiful weapons load. The problem with this comparison is that they are comparing the Fs internal payload with another planes external payload when the F can carry weapons externally as well although it loses some of its stealth when doing so. The proper comparison is a nonstealthy mission where F and other planes are using external weapons in which case the F is stated to carry  lb of total payload but if you add up its hardpoint weight limits its actually  lb  lb if you include the centerline pylon or a stealthrequired mission where the F can carry  lb of weapons internally while nonstealth airplanes carry exactly zero and would not survive in a stealthrequired environment.I could go on and on. I know Dragon even made a video series about misconceptions about the F. Again it doesnt mean that the F is necessarily good just that theres a lot of antiF crap all over the place so tread carefully.

Great. Sound engineering decision right there. Youll also notice the canard is kind of hanging off the bottom of the plane which screams lazy design work. And I suspect you are correct on the propulsion system. Pusher props are far less efficient because of the blocking effect of the body in front so even if the engine is pushing  HP it wont perform that way. It does look very cool. But it looks cool in the same way a  year old draws a cool looking airplane. Its going to end up heavy slow and hard to fly which are all the things people dont want in this market segment.

8947222,0,t3_52tr9i,Putting it nicely as others have failed do there is no cheap way. If you really want to pursue the career you have to take it one step at a time and reevaluate after each step. A PPL will set you back anywhere from  grand at your local flight school and can take anywhere from  months to  years depending on how often you fly. Next is an instrument rating  which will be around  grand and will take around  months. Then a commercial rating which is about   gs as well. The issue is that after you have these three ratings and  hours of flight time you still need  hrs of PIC time to apply to the airlines. You can get this multiple ways through being a CFI or dusting crops or hauling skydivers. Its a long process and again there is no real cheap way to do it. All that being said it is an amazing experience and a great career if thats what you want to do. Go to rflying and read the sidebar for a more detailed explanation. Dont let the negativity dissuade you from investigating further into this career path. Good luck!,aviation,d7nboai,5,t5_2qhu8

9004012,0,t1_d7trhm2,I was one of those guys that was downvoted to hell. Ill admit the reaction overall was pretty harsh and we took it too far. Again congrats on the first solo.Please keep an open mind and realize that virtually nobody including myself is trying to berate you and tell you off. Were not trying to spoil your moment or ruin your fun. raviation is a pretty closeknit community and we are all trying to look out for your safety. I knew a guy when I was a student who was killed struck in the head and another who was maimed by propellers. The second guy is lucky to be alive and has a fuck ton of steel in his back. He cannot walk anymore. I understand youre a line guy and you know the safety. The picture was probably hella worth the small risk you took and yeah the prop had a very small chance of movingstarting the engine given that you checked the magneto grounding prior to shutdown. I teach my students to always treat a propeller like a loaded gun. You wouldnt hold a loaded gun to your head right? Sure if your finger is on the trigger and you dont apply pressure the chances are very slim but if it does happen youre dead. My biggest issue was what happened if you would have slipped? Based on your body posture you would have fallen forward right into the prop arc. I would hate to see somebody else fall victim to a propeller. Since Ive started flying Ive known four people who have been killed because of complacency. Anyway apologies for the long explanation. I remember my first solo and also would have went up in arms if I felt somebody was ruining it or trying to tell me something I already knew. Congrats and stay safe. ,aviation,d7u54uf,9,t5_2qhu8

The B and F were able to take advantage of advances in computing power and come up with more complex shapes that were just as stealthy but flew a whole lot better.

I live in NYC and usually fly out of JFK I think Ive gone intoout of almost every terminal and none of them are that bad though there are clear winners T and losers T. I live in Manhattan and usually walk or cab to Penn and take the LIRR from there to Jamaica and hop on the Air Train. Its super easy and inexpensive. If you are going anywhere in Manhattan just take the LIRR! Its a bit more than the subway but it is well worth it. Rarely is it worth taking a cab unless you are leaving or arriving way way off peak. The few times Ive tried when work is paying its taken upwards of h m or more in an Uber. T is great  clean new lots of dining options Shake Shack!. The Sky Club there has an awesome terrace when the weather is nice the pre check line isnt usually too bad. Ive never hit super bad lines coming in for customs but I bet it can get pretty busy at peak times.T is whatever. I try to avoid it just because T is better but the Sky Club is perfectly serviceable. T is a super long walk from the AirTrain which is kind of annoying and the Air Space lounge there isnt great but the terminal itself is nice has free wifi and plenty of food. Last time I was there a homeless person was begging for money in the hallway which was pretty weird did they pay to get on the AirTrain from Jamaica??. T security was a mess last time I was there no Pre Check of course but once I got through the AF lounge was pretty nice though the food options are kinda crap. It feels old JFK to me compared to T though.T I have only gone through a couple of times  once late at night flying Ukraine Air and another flying UA before they moved out of JFK. There was fuck all to eat I think I ended up settling for Wendys because almost everything was closed and the seats were pretty uncomfortable. Some of the lowest ceilings I have seen and it definitely felt old. If I flew out of here often I could see why youd hate JFK. I think I flew out of T once but it didnt really make an impact. ,aviation,dbpytpm,12,t5_2qhu8

10156154,0,t1_dbv03s6,Doing interchanges are mostly impossible it simply doesnt happen that often that one part will work in two models even from the same company.  Youd think it would save a design cycle and use an existing part but it just doesnt happen that often even inside one company.  Seiko for example has a number of interchanges but by no means all and they had no problem at all making a tiny change to a fairly standard part just because.  The interchange guides that Seiko published in the s and s are a critical piece of documentation as a result.  Nothing like that exists for parts used in different watches from different companies made at different times.I am totally not up on Citizen honestly.  I dont work on or collect them.  My main supplier has a few parts listed for that model but almost nothing really and none of the recording wheels.  Its one of those things where youll need to to pick up junkers and hope theyve got good parts.  Im sure there is a better way that someone must have them.

10689718,0,t1_ddhev48,Probably never. Plane crashes happen due to a chain of events leading up to the crash never just one. It isnt possible to design a plane that can deal with every possible combination of errors and the moment it runs into a scenario which it was not prepared to handle hundreds of lives are at risk.An example would be the Qantas A that had an uncontained engine failure destroying much of the wiring. The ECAM lit up with dozens of false alerts that took the pilots over an hour to troubleshoot before they were able to ensure a safe landing. A pilotless plane cannot exercise judgement and would have no way of knowing which alerts are real and which arent meaning it cant effectively deal with it. That puts everyone at risk. More automation with pilots still in the cockpit isnt the answer either as overreliance on automation has been proven to erode piloting skills and increase pilot error. The automation you suggest will make flight safer has the opposite effect.,aviation,ddikddp,1,t5_2qhu8
10691299,0,t1_ddioxy4,Back in Vietnam the radars and avionics were using vacuum tubes. Your smartphone literally has hundreds of times more processing power than the F. The F has AESA radar infrared electrooptical sensors sensor fusion plus he is datalinked to other Fs and AWACS. I think our ability to ID targets from BVR has improved dramatically. Aside from that a big reason Fs suffered big losses is because pilots literally had almost zero training in dogfights. This is the whole reason Top Gun was established. After getting better training the Navys exchange ratio dramatically improved.  When it comes to dogfighting the pilots skills and tactics are hugely important. Its not just about raw kinematic performance. Most aircraft have relative strengths and weaknesses. ACM is still part of the F training syllabus. I guarantee you it was part of their Red Flag training. ,aviation,ddiq8od,6,t5_2qhu8

10743923,0,t3_5tj81t,Hawaiian AirlinesAll Hawaiian Airlines aircraft currently in service have a unique and special name. Our Bs and Bs are named after birds and each A bears the name of a star or constellation used by Polynesian voyagers for celestial navigation. Our ATRs Ohana by Hawaiian are named after winds found on Lnai Molokai and Oahu Leeward  the shorthaul routes served by this airliner.Long before Western explorers set sail Polynesian sailors were traversing thousands of miles of open ocean without the benefit of instruments or charts. These wayfarers found their maps in the stars above them in the celestial bodies that guided them across the Pacific.  Our first longhaul widebody A was christened Makalii. Known as Pleiades or the Seven Sisters in Western astronomy Makalii is a cluster of stars that appear in the Northern Hemispheres wintertime sky. The star cluster is near Earth and is easy to see with the naked eye. In the Islands the cluster is highly revered having guided both Hawaiian voyagers and farmers preparing for harvest and the Makahiki.Makalii was chosen to be the first name because it would have been a prominent constellation during the time of the year when Hawaiian first took to the skies on Nov.  .The name Hklea or star of gladness christened our second Airbus NHA. Also known as Arcturus this star is the brightest in the Northern Hemisphere and was the guiding beacon for sailors who made the long voyage north from the Marquesas and Tahiti to Hawaii.

10821016,0,t3_5uqilh,The best selling point of the F is that its electronics enable it to act as a force multiplier to make prior generation aircraft more capable.gt How will the F work with legacy air assets and in an airtosurface environment? The F will make legacy aircraft around it more capable through its ability to process data in the air. Once processed the data will be converted into a Link  message and transferred to legacy aircraft or surface teams.  At present surface assets suffer from a significant bandwidth problem. The Fs processors can lend a hand by processing data and sending appropriate results to the ground forces. gt The F will also have a significant impact in organizing air combat operations.  The more recent aircraft such as Eurofighter and upgraded Fs and Fs are most easily organized for operations by the F. The older aircraft can also be organized more efficiently by the Fs processing and stealth capacities as well as the ability to share this data in realtime. These efforts combined will shape more effective collaborative decisionmaking.,aviation,ddw40yg,5,t5_2qhu8

11580029,0,t3_659h8r,Considerations vary by destination. Overall Id say the order looks like this for many routes. . Peak Demand  to get the highest ticket prices airlines will select times where most people want to depart and arrive. For departures thats going to be between pm and pm. For arrivals thats going to be between am and pm. The biggest factor for hubandspoke airlines is getting longhaul flights to connect to local flights. That means departures need to be late enough in the day to allow people to take one flight prior to the longhaul flight. For arrivals that means having connecting flights available after landing.. Aircraft Utilization  revenue is generated when planes are moving. While some routes require an aircraft to be parked before returning in a perfect world they would turn around immediately. This works out great for routes that are about  hrs long as the same aircraft can be scheduled to go back and forth . Flights that are shorter or longer need to either park or shift to a different route. That means a departure time for a New York to London route can be determined by the aircrafts next arrival time in Tokyo. . Local Considerations  Some airports are periodically at max capacity and need to be avoided a certain times. Some airports have noise restrictions and no departures are allowed at night. Some airports have weather that makes it unlikely to land at times. . Cluster Theory  While typically applied to competition for physical locations it also applies to arrivaldeparture times. It would be great if arrivaldeparture times were spread out but competition causes airlines to group their schedules. Ted Talks has a decent video on this if you have  min. words are harder than they look.,aviation,dg8lpno,4,t5_2qhu8

11615773,0,t1_dgcedb1,Its not that we hate its that its not a real plane.  Its a deathtrap.  It is a number of ridiculous design features that have been glomped together to look like a cool stealthy fighter.  But they dont work together. It is very likely the thing isnt even capable of breaking the sound barrier kinda a requisite in modern combat fighters and if it ever does it will break apart almost immediately. It is certain that its engines would certainly become air starved at that point and flame out. uIShouldBeStudying has a good point that it could be a low speed aircraft carrier killer that uses ground effect but that seems kinda limited.  Ground effect only works when seas are calm and weather clear.  I would hope the entire Iranian Air Force in planning to fight off western adversaries isnt pinning its hopes on there being fair winds and following seas. Either way at this point it has come across as nothing more than a very expensive PR stunt and most of the west has recognized this almost immediately.,aviation,dgcnpae,16,t5_2qhu8
