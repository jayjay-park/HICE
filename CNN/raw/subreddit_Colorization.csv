4381280,0,t3_3b7drw,penelope cruz ballet  Colorization of black and white photo using Corel PaintShopPro X with a mouse demonstrating some techniques rather than producing a high quality result.NotesPreparation involved doubling the image size converting to grey scale and back to full color flood fill colorizing the entire image with color for mortar. Save a lot of time.Start from the back and work forward making sure to color hidden objects over the tutu and hair. The only use of layers involved painting the entire tutu then changing its opacity until the lacy parts appear semitransparent. More solid tutu coloring was done after the layer flattened to the background.Stray hair was colored at full opacity then the background washed over it very opaquely until each strand looked right.The face was not given the usual detail and attention due to image quality and this being a video demo.Total time taken was  hours.,Colorization,csji85n,3,t5_2t9sl

But dont leave any of them grey  use a very low saturated blue if you need. Same with the whitest and blackest objects color everything. The silver screws are pretty good as they are but look closely for reflections.If youve done the console face plates too strong and they look overly colorful make the distant walls a brighter color and perhaps increase vibrancy on the buttons and other console components. Basically  hide it in the shadow of other objects.Looks like you are on the right path  keep going.A thousand internet points if you do his shirt a very soft low saturation blue and color each stripe individually.A million internet points if you get the pencil just right!,Colorization,cxb5azl,2,t5_2t9sl

10520438,0,t1_dd0gm8t,Thanks! I have a few shades of that pinky brown and then a yellow in the background. I used a radial motion blur to blend them for some texture. Then I used the gradient map on to try to bring a bit of contrast to be those shadows. I thought it turned out decently.Im not overly happy with the rest. Its bland and undynamic. The skin looks modelled and sickly. Your skin is some of the best Ive seen you do. The pink highlights around the eyes is perfect. The multiple colours if Jerrys jacket really pop it out nicely as well.,Colorization,dd0lsvc,1,t5_2t9sl
10535880,0,t3_5qszzs,Not a bad start. It could use some tone shifting for sure. I would work on finding the sweet spot with the skin more orangepink. Other colors look a bit thick  like theyre painted over the surface instead of part of it a transparencyblending mode issue probably. I dont know what program youre using to offer any suggestions.Keep working at it!,Colorization,dd2cwu1,2,t5_2t9sl
