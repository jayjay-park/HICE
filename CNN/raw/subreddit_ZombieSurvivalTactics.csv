559192,0,t1_cfadfd3,The lone survivor bit checks out well with me except in a zombie apocalypse you wouldnt want to be going out alone in complete darkness remember power will probably be out and in cities minimal engagement and moving stealthily between multiple stashes wont really work. Youd be surprised Zombies are more attentive than you think. And there is always strength in numbers.

1219498,0,t1_ci6s2s4,A lot of cars will have gas in them. A lot will be left in parking lots or driveways. Most families have two cars but if they leave they will only take one if they survive long enough to take a car anywhere. Some will be abandoned because they are out of gas but thats not the only reason to ditch a car. If you get stuck surrounded get into an accident etc. If one car stops and blocks traffic odds are other cars are going to end up getting piled up behind them when the road becomes impassable. This will be especially true in the city. I work mostly downtown so getting home might mean I have to ditch my car and proceed on foot until I find something else.

1386634,0,t1_ciq1rf4,I stand corrected. That is a much more badass slingshot than any Ive ever seen. Adding arrows into the mix would certainly make a huge difference. When yours arrives you should do a review for us. I would be interested in seeing what the learning curve is like. It seems like it would be fairly comparable to a bow which require considerable skill in order to reliably get head shots. The problem with any of this sort of weapon is that it is really a niche weapon. It is useful but only in a very limited set of circumstances. Mostly because you only get one shot. If youre in a city theres a good chance you might never encounter a single zombie one at a time. And of course living people have been known to keep fighting for quite some time even after receiving a mortal wound. Not to mention that under combat stress accuracy goes to shit even for professionals so the odds that you or I will be able to consistently hit a zombies brain or a persons vital organs under stress are incredibly slim. Thats true for any weapon but bows and slings tend to require even more skill and have almost no margin for error. That said in your situation youve got to work with what youve got so it sounds like you are making an excellent choice based on your extremely limited options. As they say the best weapon is the one you are carrying. As for the cross bow legality aside I disagree about its relative combat effectiveness. You mentioned the risk of over penetration. That is a concern. Everything is a trade off. Along with the increased risk of over penetration comes a dramatic increase in range and accuracy. You are going to have a much flatter trajectory which means that it will be much easier to point and shoot. The slower and heavier the projectile the sooner gravity will start to pull it down forcing you to adjust your aim. A slower projectile also means that you have to lead the target more to account for the time that the projectile spends in the air. This makes it much harder to hit a moving target. Even an Olympic archer would have trouble hitting a brain sized moving target in a combat situation with a bow. A crossbow is still not going to be as accurate as a firearm unless youre Darryl from The Walking but its a lot better than a bow or a slingshot. A crossbow is also easier to use. I was into archery growing up and I still occasionally dabble. Lining up a bow on target consistently takes a lot of practice even if you have bow sights. Using a weapon with a stock on the other hand gives you more fixed points of contact with the weapon so all you need to do is shoulder the weapon again unless youre Darryl and bring the sights up to your eye. They should be most of the way lined up already. I would much rather lose an arrow because I shoot through a zombie than lose one because I missed entirely. I can always make more. A small pistol handle cross bow would actually be the worst of both worlds not the best.As I said I get that legality may make it impractical to acquire one but its actually a much better weapon. Its so much better that when they were first invented they were considered inhumane by the standards of the day. Im curious to hear how the sling shot performs once you get the chance to take it out in the field and put it through its paces. Please keep us posted. Edit I watched the zombies go boom videos. Please please please dont listen to them. The videos are kind of fun but their tests have nothing to do with the real world.,ZombieSurvivalTactics,ciq3hm0,2,t5_2ta4y
1489474,0,t1_cj2yogr,The double barreled with inserts can literally shoot any ammo smaller than  ga which is almost all of them. The two shots forces you to conserve ammunition the simple workings make it difficult to break compared to others and it can be used to hunt animals for food as well as zombies. Im not saying it is perfect at all. The disadvantages are obvious. Low capacity and a fairly high weight for that capacity. But I dont think it could be discounted.As for revolvers Handguns should be last resort regardless of target. A semiauto reloads faster but putting individual bullets in a magazine is much slower than reloading a revolver which is durable good against neglect and abuse and can take multiple ammo types like . taking . sp rounds. And even with a pistol that never jams like glock there is still a rather lengthy clearing cycle as opposed to just pulling the trigger again.But if you want semiauto a glock. mm.

Theyre about as scientific as the Creationist museum. These are the same guys who used an AR to cut the head off a gel torso as if that makes sense. The reality is that there is no good way of testing the real world applicability of  weapon except possibly through actual field trials on real zombies. Thats part of the reason why theres so much debate about ammunition and terminal ballistics. Things dont perform the same way in the real world as they do in lab settings not that those guys are anywhere close to lab settings. ,ZombieSurvivalTactics,cp8om49,1,t5_2ta4y

Box mags fixed this problem and also more than doubled capacity. As for surviving the war theres no doubt that the garand is indestructible. However the AR platform has been used in every American conflict since then as well as countless other conflicts. It has proved itself a more than worthy successor to the Garand and been in service much longer. ,ZombieSurvivalTactics,cs5qtiz,1,t5_2ta4y

4666206,0,t1_ctipe6r,As I said you know your area better than I do. Couple nitpicky points though. You can load a partial magazine and it takes the same amount of time as a full magazine. What I think youre getting at is that if all you have are lose rounds then its easier to reload a couple into a tube than into a box mag. Thats true. However it doesnt really matter because you just wouldnt bother to carry loose rounds. You would just carry as many magazines as you reasonably can and stash the rest. You might need to carry a lot of magazines if you are limited to  rounds but thats still easier and lighter than the equivalent in shotgun shells. Also an  round mag tube is great for competition but for combat it would be a bitch especially if you have a  inch hunting barrel to go along with it. If youre doing a search providing cover or just trying to hold the weapon on target for any length of time you will wear out very quickly. God forbid you need to hold it one handed while you open a door or drag a buddy. Trust me even a standard police shotgun gets heavy very very quickly. Also you are not likely to be carrying more than one long gun. Dont count on having a different gun for different situations. Assume youll be stuck with whats in your hands. But like I said Im nitpicking. Youre absolutely correct that none of that matters if you cant keep it fed. In your situation a shotgun sounds like it would be my first choice too. ,ZombieSurvivalTactics,ctiqabf,1,t5_2ta4y

6815441,0,t1_d0otet1,My other post goes in this thread goes into more detail this is just addressing the commonality of materials for making more ammo versus making more arrows. The amount of people who know how to use a bow are incredibly outnumbered by those who know how to use a gun and those who have a general idea how to use a gun. Which is why itll be easier for those that do take archery such as me and JaronK to find more arrows. Yes theres a quantity problem. We only ever get  arrows per pack but thats compensated for by the amount thats available. Not by much but enough for an archer to get by with a bow as a primary and a sidearm.

7350261,0,t1_d2d41oz,gtAs for the extra clothes its more from personal experience where I was camping and hiking for a week and it was storming start of a hurricane hard the last day and we still had a  mile ruck back got soaked through my rain gear and then the rain turned into a light sprinkle. I was so glad to have a full change of clothes after that because  miles with wet feet sucks but being cold and wet all over is worse. A lot of us were borderline hypothermic before we changed blue lips and pale skin it was a good time. And it adds virtually now weight when I do it or at least I cant really feel the difference. The inconvenience comes from space but not even that much. For me at least. I will definitely add som TP to that Tier though never know when youll need it.Im not going to argue against real world experience. If it works for you do it. gtI do have a nice ground pad I can try to add but it takes up some room I was gonna use the woobie as a ground pad if needed as well as a blanket. The med kit is a lot of first responder stuff but the SF medical handbook I am reading does have a lot of long term field fixes for stuff that normally covers an ER so I am torn with that. In a more secure base recovery is possible. The NS is more of a if there is a carmain base item I understand theres no real need to carry it in the field but if I could leave it somewhere safer it can help with dehydration as well as shock from massive hemorrhaging. Of course this depends on the standard of living at the time are we in some dinky camp with  of us where its not really needed or do we have  people living in a compound trying to start rebuilding. For T I would hope to leave the pack in a vehicle or base but have the option to just pick it up and go if needed. Again if possible the entertainment would be in the ruck in a vehicle but if thats not possible I think I would still keep a book and deck of cards in the ruck since they dont take up too much space. Ive seen a lot of push for the Sawyer Water filter so I will look into that as a good purification system. I can probably stock up on some mre heaters and basic mess kit material as well as some spice packets and carb drink mixes. I was thinking more for cooking. As time goes on you will probably be eating more improvised meals rather than pre prepared ones. The canteen is ok for emergency boiling water but for a longer terms situation you will probably want a cook pot. gtThe chem lights were for in the off chance that things need to be done at night we could still keep track of each other red subdued chem lights. I do have an extra flashlight with a red lens but it is not as powerful as my primary which doesnt have a red light lens any more... Im currently in a pretty hot and humid lately climate during the summer so extra water is something I will need to have with me.Still not a fan of chem lights. Disposable and not that useful. Plus you cant easily turn them off. Also having red lights isnt actually that important. A white light of equal intensity is just as good. Overall good kit. I would look into getting a claw hammer though. Theyre pretty cheap and theyre useful around the house so its not wasted if the zombies show up. But the nice thing is that if you dont have one everyone else does. You could scrounge one. ,ZombieSurvivalTactics,d2doai2,1,t5_2ta4y

10857719,0,t1_ddzubzo,If were talking about  days later zombies then yes I would be dead. There is absolutely no practical way to fight them other than being in the right place at the right time. Thats my entire point. But perhaps Im not illustrating my point very well. Here is a video of a very small group of people most of whom are actively trying to get out of his way. Now imagine it with rush hour traffic and a lot more people. I think simply driving through is not a realistic expectation. Maybe you could get through a couple but I think its only a matter of time before you get stuck. gtBro your honestly just being stupid at this point the wells are spickets and garden hoses lmao. You turn it on and throw those hose on the roof. Like this is what Im talking about you making everything complicated. Im not doing that without distracting the zombies or whatever. Same way I got in there.Or whatever. Please elaborate. How would you distract them exactly and for how long? What would you do if you encountered a snag for example what if the hose you picked wasnt long enough to reach the roof or the house didnt have a well? You would have to change plans on the fly with infected running around. In the movies they barely have time to stop and change a tire and those streets are unrealistically bare. It would be more like trying to set up a garden hose in the middle of thisThats a relatively small crowd. Any town would have a lot more people a lot more cars and a lot more chaos. Now maybe this is just my limited imagination but I cant imagine what you could come up with on the fly that would buy you twenty seconds let alone  minutes in the middle of that. And this thing spreads so rapidly that this would be everywhere if it made it to your island. I dont think any survival plan would help you in that case.gtWow dude you are really turning me off to this subIf thats be case I sincerely apologize. That is not my intent.
