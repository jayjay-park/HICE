664462,0,t1_cgfqby7,gt Either youre saying the Nakba wasnt evil because the Kristalnacht wasnt evil... or else I dont know what youre saying.That they are not as simplistically comparable as you claim.gtThis was not a war Yes there was but you are fine with Arabs killing Jews so you dont care.gt this was the same Lebensraum policy as that of the Nazis.Except not. Except that there was no attempt to exterminate the Germans while the Arabs worked with the Germans to exterminate the Jews. Oh thats right you deny the Holocaust so you deny that.gt Palestinians lived lives of hell.So no death camps just mistreatment by Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Lebanon. gtThe Nakba was similar to Kristalnacht in some ways  but up to  times more deadly.Or even less deadly.gtUp to  times more deadly since unlike the Nazis the Zionists lied to their victims about what they intended.According to you the Nazis did not intent to kill the Jews did not intend to exterminate them. According to you the Nazis were honest and honorable.gtIts even very questionable whether the Nazis ever intended an ethnic cleansing Questionable as in racists and deniers question it.,israelexposed,cgfsrfm,-1,t5_2r8ic

1576841,0,t1_cjdvzip,The first part of your reply is irrelevant  one cannot deduce the precise inclination of a person simply from analyzing his post tags or his racebelief system  they are too general and not important.besides if you read his entire post you find that he is far from being a staunch Zionist.gtApparently there are just m jews in the world and . billion muslims. There were probablly  nazis amongst m Germans during ww. So do the nazis get a pass?Again it is not important because the post has a larger issue which is gtAnd again you have to ask yourself what do these groups want? What would they accomplish if they could accomplish anything? What would the Israelis do if they could do what they want? They would live in peace with their neighbors if they had neighbors who would live in peace with them.andgtWhat do groups like ISIS and alQaeda and even Hamas want? They want to impose their religious views on the rest of humanity. They want stifle every freedom that decent educated secular people care about. This is not a trivial difference. And yet judging from the level of condemnation that Israel now receives you would think the difference ran the other way.Those arguments are supported by the claims that precede them and i have to say he does make a compelling argument.BTW  your numbers are all wrong  by the end of  there were .m registered members of the nazi party from a total of m Germans  again  not so much important as the arguments are different then those you seem to latch on to and the fact that numbers are pinpointed to different dates and are incomplete  the number .m registered members of the nazi party is related to numbers of members in  when a large majority of potential members were killed in the war  soldiers and civilians  so it may not reflect the true number of nazis who were supposed to be held accountable for their crimes also  maybe that number doesnt reflect the real number of nazis as maybe some were not registered also  all of the number thing is meaningless as the case is completely different.,israelexposed,cjdxm0b,-1,t5_2r8ic

4103367,0,t1_crnunfg,I suppose youll be out there on the blockading lines yourself... not likely. People do not exist for your viewing pleasure. What happens when the Lord Almighty destroys the nations that comes against Israel though they be every nation together? I can see how Armageddon is going to be a selffulfilling prophecy. You people are so selfish and dimwitted that youd defy the forces of nature. Not gonna work.So now were up to as recent as ? What happened to  years of Filastin? I guess when one meme fails try another right? Couldnt possibly get a grip on the here and now.Im a genocidal racist?? From the seat of my smartphone? But real murdering doesnt count.Im misanthropic... I dont like anyone. So nows my turn you have no human feeling and really dont care about anything but what amounts to sports television. I live on the street in the real world and for that I get respect from time to time. People want honesty over images. But promises are made to be broken like any relationship. When the tools of man become the master we are all slaves. If theres a contract it can always be settled in money there is a natural rule against perpetuities. Im sure the feudal lords cried foul but lost their land they did.If you want a more relevant legal analogy consider the whole thing a longterm eminent domain action. Boundaries and uses are made to be condemned for nature will out one way or another.Ethnic strife is not murdering your own people. Nations are not made out of abstractions nations are made by survival. How do you think you got to such a comfy perch? Your ancestors survived plain and simple. Suddenly new rules are invented that just happen to favor the victors. How nice of you. Guess what asshole nobody cares. Least of all some godforsaken savages who couldnt find these lines on a map. Go mau mau with your communist brothers in arms and see if they dont cut your head off too. I know Arabs I know them personally quite well from being in Europe and the Middle East but anyone who thinks otherwise has a friendly Daeesh fighter to help them along Im sure theyd love to love you for dinner... with salt and pepper to taste.,israelexposed,cro0bw9,0,t5_2r8ic
