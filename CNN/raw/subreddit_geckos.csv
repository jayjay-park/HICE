1813922,0,t1_ck7qja9,You dont have a credit card to order online?I am trying to avoid doing business with petco again. I would like to order a gecko possibly onlineAnd true you never did say you dont care about quality but you prove that is the case when youre only willing to pay  for a gecko. You even said you werent willing to pay more than  with shipping included from an online breeder.You prove that you dont care about quality when you consistently purchase from Petsmart and then complain about how youre trying to avoid shopping there because of what happened with your last reptile. And I think its disgusting that youre all happy go lucky about Hey if this one ends up sick like the last one its okay! Theyll take him back!.Also youve stated in your last post that youre using your water dragons set up for your gecko. Reptiles are not a one size fits all animal. Im interested in knowing what your set up is like. ,geckos,ck7rb14,3,t5_2rrui
2241577,0,t1_clmoapn,OK cool! Now that I have a name to that face I agree! I made the assumption bc the  or  of the house geckos are cohabiting with the Tokays in the bamboo spaces. I only have spotted them around the same time when the tokays are out at night.other baby newer pic ,geckos,cloraov,1,t5_2rrui
2537914,0,t3_2nt18o,Hope its solved by now but Ive noticed good progress when the enclosure also has the chance to dry out daily. Then the skin isnt always clinging to their body. Once it looks dry again spray again. Alternating the dryness with the humidity daily seems to make it easier to flake off. Or at least get to a point where its hanging enough so that you can tweeze it off after you spray again. I have a hatchling that gives up on getting shed off after what seems like  minutes and this has helped.,geckos,cmpuayq,1,t5_2rrui

3375215,0,t1_cpczfca,I meant a form of tile not like wood chips or anything.And the nocturnal animal does not have any need for a light. I am not disagreeing with you. And are you thinking I mean a bulb at night? Because if so Im sorry that is not what I mean at all. But a bulb during the day is the only thing I can think of that is easy to obtain and can hold the approximate  in the warm side.,geckos,cpczzo9,2,t5_2rrui

5111806,0,t3_3kws6i,It wasnt necessarily a dumb question given that they were sort of dumped on you and you dont have much experience with them. If theyre both adults they definitely cant be housed together up until theyre sub adult theyre usually fine. I personally own gargoyles but my best friend is a crestie breeder and Im pretty hands on in her buisnesscare of the reptiles. Depending on how big the original tank is the aggressive gecko should be okay in it until you can afford another setup. I use exoterra tanks and order off amazon I can get the xx tanks about  cheaper there. For the adults I like to go bigger but it isnt always necessary. Either way the aggressive gecko will most likely be fine for the time being might get a little grumpy but it shouldnt keel over immediately  hope something here helps!,geckos,cv25wx5,5,t5_2rrui
5172526,0,t3_3ltnw8,Cohabitation is always a bad idea with geckos especially a male and female pairing. Typically theyre only put together long enough to breed and then put in separate enclosures again. With a male and a female living in the same space you run the risk of the male constantly mating with the female until she dies of exhaustion or something prolapses. Additionally one might bully the other away from food or shelter or they might fight and injure each other. I highly advise against cohabiting geckos at all. ,geckos,cv9h9wz,3,t5_2rrui
5173309,0,t3_3luxvf,Im not convinced that its a leo. My guess would be African fat tailed gecko. They look very similar to leos but pudgier and with darker eyes. Their patterning is slightly different too. Can we summon uherherpsnderps to mediate?,geckos,cv9ko1k,4,t5_2rrui
5226199,0,t3_3mincg,Congrats on the gargoyle gecko! I have one they are lovely. I would say maybe once a month on the eggs. Make sure you have a laybox for her and keep a small dish of calcium powder available for her. Laying will deplete the calcium stores quickly. Their care is pretty much identical to crested geckos. If not already I recommend getting her on Pangaea complete crested gecko diet with dusted insects weekly at most.,geckos,cvfy580,2,t5_2rrui
5439270,0,t1_cw6w55a,I can give her more mealworms maybe? I feed her every other day but I can make it every day.  I would assume she would have a hard time catching the cricket.. she takes at least  attempts to grab the worm in front of her,geckos,cw6x4sf,1,t5_2rrui

8243009,0,t3_4s0s4c,I agree that corn cob is not appropriate for most lizards but the right kind of substrate depends heavily on what kind of gecko youre getting. EcoEarth can be great for tropical species but if youre picking up a young animal its not advisable to use loose substrate as they are clumsy and subject to getting mouthfuls of dirt. I only use EcoEarth in my adult Leachie and Day Gecko setups and my CrestedsGargoylesChahouaLeos all get paper towels. ,geckos,d57xjsz,1,t5_2rrui

11575932,0,t3_656jnp,You should lose the eco earth. Not only does it hold humidity but it is a risk for impaction. Id suggest replacing with tile or paper towel. How much ventilation does the tank have? A screen lid? If your room is very humid Id suggest putting a fan in the room to circulate the air. Otherwise just add more ventilation and maybe a smaller water dish. ,geckos,dg84z7h,3,t5_2rrui
