605037,0,t3_2129qd,Ive recorded macros for about  years but I wrote my first loop  months ago and it has changed everything...so  months.My job is in an actuarial department so there is a lot of data and we need ways to produce reports and utilize a ton of data.  VBA wasnt used in the small unit I work in  people but now the job involves VBA for a few reports that we publish.Every week Im working on new projects.  Its really a great opportunity.  There is a lot of potential automation left but I can only work on so much at once!Strangely enough I just made a post about how everyone talking salary on reddit is lying...but k.I started in actuary at an entry level position and beefed up my excel skills formulas not VBA.

1418777,0,t1_ciu3vlr,Great call!Also you can sacrifice some speed and save memory by not compiling OutArray and instead writing to cells on the sheet.  But I think the better solution is as you described for my HugeArray instead of writing one huge OutArray just write a  row many column OutArray for each item in the dictionary then output that to the sheet.On a total sidenote I am not completely sure of my results but I think in the past I have assigned members of an array to a dictionary and when I erased the array the dictionary got borked as if the dictionary actually just held pointers to the array data.  I had originally not used inititem and initgroup and left HugeArray unerased.  So instead of      AllItemDic.add inititem tempdicI used      AllItemDic.Add HugeArrayi j tempdic  And after dictionaries were built I erased hugearray then that AllItemDic Key was null or missing.  I switched this coding a bit once I got my first Out of Memory error.  Once I saw that my method used with the actual data would generate an array of potentially  x  I knew my approach as written would not work.,vba,ciu4ens,2,t5_2rnlw

So if you type Dim A B C as integer only C has the variable type integer while A amp B are variants which should be avoided unless theyre absolutely necessary. To declare all three as integer data types you have to write dim a as integer b as integer c as integer.Also in your foreachnext loop later you use the cel variable without declaring it. So its data type is also a variant. You should ALWAYS use the option explicit declaration in your macros so youre forced to declare your variables.,vba,d8950uh,2,t5_2rnlw

Again limited understanding  most of this code was copied from elsewhere on the web  I think using cell is just saying find EXAMPLE and missing the rest of the string which wont work in this case and the reason I though using a named range would.

11346285,0,t3_61w4tm,Pretty sure you can read title slides and pull the text using VBA although the PowerPoint needs to be open to do this. My recommendation is to do this within excel calling on the PowerPoint reference. Looping through each PowerPoint in the folder opening it grabbing the current name in column A and the extract of the title into column B then closing it. That way you can tidy up and titles removing any special characters etc. Then perform a loop of your list using the Name function to rename your PowerPoints.Name cDirDirOldFileName.ext As cDirDirNewFileName.extYou need to give the full path in this function.Also test your loop on a small sample you dont want to start a loop going on such large data sets without some tests.,vba,dfi2xnh,2,t5_2rnlw

I am very new to userforms and trying to carry over variables between multiple modulesobjects so Im diving in the deep end.I ended up going pretty much the opposite way of your suggestion.  I put all the information in my module and the two variables that I needed to call in my userform are declared as public on the top of my module and its working out perfectly.  It actually fixed another issue I was having with an array in my userform that I needed to carry to the module so doing it the other way and having the userform calls in my module actually simplified it a lot.  Thank you for the idea though.I have a side question maybe you can help with...  Im trying to set the default selections of the listbox to none since its currently a little buggy where its defaulting to the first item in the sense that it acts like its selected but its visually not highlighted and if I try to run the code it gives me an error based on nothing being selected.
