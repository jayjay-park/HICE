She has been confirmed a common for release sometime this summer along with Captain Marvel and She Hulk unless its some type of variant. If anything the teaser strongly suggests the exclusive Pop we will be getting is Squirrel Girl. ,SpiderGwen,d2c7wo8,0,t5_33ytn

8894926,0,t1_d7gtmzt,Ahh okay I saw Web Warriors in the comic store but didnt know it tied in to the story so much! I thought Latour would use the  inside the comic to point to Web Warriors or Gwen would refer to something in there in her comic. Does Web Warriors go into more detail about why Silk thinks Gwen hates her? I thought that was an interesting reaction since Gwen voluntarily went with Silk to try and rescue Jessica Drew.I see the inexperience angle youre saying and thats a great point. There are many facets to her story to make her feel how she does..SpiderWoman got her into this mess with Castle and shes the only one that can get herself out of it.,SpiderGwen,d7h1kak,1,t5_33ytn
