Thinking of recording the event as well. might be worth combining peoples footage to get some good angles etc.,EliteRacers,cop42bj,2,t5_3618a

3329855,0,t3_2yawv7,Ive yet to actually participate in one of these races but I assume theres a reason why Eagles with aclass thrusters seem to almost universally be the ship of choice around here. ,EliteRacers,cp7twk9,2,t5_3618a

3430613,0,t1_cpjamks,I actually did some concept work on those iconsthe eagle didnt turn out bad but the T just ended up like a big blob which it is. Need to take a second pass on those and redo the pixel by pixel work to clean up the lines after Im finished with the next few iterations of the Elite Racers logo based on some ideas Im getting from the feedback.Actually new ideadownvote as upside down uncharged capacitor warning should be much cleaner!,EliteRacers,cpjbdh9,5,t5_3618a
3444959,0,t1_cpky3qe,its just such a shame! I think itd be cool to have it in Open because then people dont have to add xombie and join his private group. they can just show up and maybe be spectators without the effort. the races should probably be in private but i mean we did manage it in the end. I dont want to but I know youre probably right.related note please do not give out the teamspeak to anyone theres a reason I dont have it just listed in the sidebar.,EliteRacers,cpky8e1,3,t5_3618a
