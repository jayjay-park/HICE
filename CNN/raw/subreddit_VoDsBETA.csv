203673,0,t3_1w38cr,To the extent that your goal is to make these posts easier to navigate as they get longer I think theres a more important thing to address which is make the distinctions between the weeks clearer.  I think it would be much faster for me if I could instantly identify where say week  is visually without having to read anything and then read to find specific days.If I were to oversimplify the formatting idea Im trying to explain Id rather have these things organized asWeek Day Day Day Week Day Day Day Rather than the current format ofWeek  Day Week  Day Week  Day Week  Day Week  Day Week  Day Hopefully that gets the idea across even though in reality theres a lot more stuff going on and so it would be more complicated than that simple idea.  Sorry for going off on a bit of a tangent and as always thanks for all the work you do on rloleventvods.,VoDsBETA,cf1n47p,2,t5_2xu9u
