2534873,0,t1_cmpfky5,So let me get this straight you think I should add to Dillas legacy by vandalizing DD store property and posting pics of it online?Ill pass.Its not my job to add to Dillas Legacy Im not Dilla or related to Dilla. I saw a design idea and pursued it.Logo flipping is the same as sample flipping and we all know how popular that is in hiphop amongst producers including Dilla. What you said is akin to saying Sampling is getting old.And I dont really think you know what you are talking about the original DD logo has KERNING issues in that the DUNKIN letters have different spacing than the DONUTS letters.,jdilla,cmpg08d,0,t5_2trth
