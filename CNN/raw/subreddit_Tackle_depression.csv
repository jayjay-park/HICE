I have been in that empty void many times it is hard to get out of if you dont tell anyone who loves you want wants to help you. ,Tackle_depression,cz4csnk,1,t5_2wv2f

7680674,0,t3_4kg84m,I hear you. I know how you feel. Ive been there. Yes going to work is less of a problem than staying home with ones own thoughts when it gets that bad. And it is painful to see how it affects ones love ones not just oneself. One of the problems with depression is that it eats away hope and the ability to see a way out. And so when it gets bad then one does not see that it will get better. Nonetheless it will get better. Trust me it does get better. And you do not have to loose yourself to this disease it is possible to find oneself again despite depression there is hope. Hang in there. Since you are concerned about effects on loved ones maybe you can use that as part of motivation to make positive changes? If doctors appointment is too far away dont wait for it. Try self improvements of some sort for loved ones sake. For me regular exercising has helped a great deal. Its not a miracle cure and I still struggle but it has made a huge difference for the better. The problem is finding the motivation to get started but once it becomes a habit it does get better.,Tackle_depression,d3f8vmb,2,t5_2wv2f
7687655,0,t3_4kh6uf,I agree that you need to find your reason for living. It isnt always easy though. I was never one of those kids who knew what he wanted to do as an adult. I graduated high school and I did the typical thing of going to college right after. This backfired and I failed out of college twice partly due to depression and a lack of direction. Im finally about to graduate nearly  years later. I have had a lot of struggles over those  years but they have allowed me to figure out what I want out of life. I dont have a ton of friends and my family doesnt necessarily support my vision for my life but I have found my own drive and purpose. I still see a therapist each week to talk things out and its been immensely helpful. I recommend finding one you can trust which can take some time and really looking inside yourself to discover what you are passionate about. Im sorry things are so rough right now but I have faith that you can get out of this rut. Keep your chin up and feel free to reach out to myself or others on this board if you need to.,Tackle_depression,d3g1dqe,1,t5_2wv2f
7834731,0,t3_4mmbuy,You could try doing something you find scary like going on roller coaster and see if you feel the fear. Sometimes that loosens other emotions.,Tackle_depression,d3wowl7,1,t5_2wv2f

7889060,0,t3_4mmbuy,Let me relate at least a little. everyday I think about my damage my self image that is destroyed my confidence my personal failures my times being fired in a row for talking too much. my problems that i created deep within myself. Im learning to meditate clear my thoughts racing in my head and simply focus my attention on the simple act of breathing in.. then slowly and purposefully. this is where you will find good bad happy sad and energy to recover from this. you can bring yourself to a therapist and talk with them personally about your goals and how well meditation works for you. Im not here to spark your interest in some kind of metaphysical bullcrap. but simply knowing after all the emotions go haywire the feeling of peace is not an emotion you have. its a state of mind. ,Tackle_depression,d42sxhm,1,t5_2wv2f
8281850,0,t1_d5cr7t5,I think there is stress that is destructive and stress that is positively uplifting. In a good work environment there can still be stress but the stress is for example because one has a tight deadline on a challenging project that I can handle. Its when the stress is due to human beings not acting professionally that the stress is destructive. I really should not take things so personally but it is hard not to. I bounced back quicker though this time than in the past so progress.,Tackle_depression,d5csgv4,1,t5_2wv2f
10297168,0,t1_dcb8cty,Excellent! Glad to hear it. I have been struggling with regularly meditating myself actually. I am now giving Tai Chi a try again since it is something in between exercise and meditation and I realized when reviewing my diary that I had been learning Tai Chi during my happiest month last year and maybe it is not a coincidence.Good luck with your continued efforts.,Tackle_depression,dcb8n4l,1,t5_2wv2f
