440592,0,t1_cfqd5ul,Mmmm sounds amazing right about now. I have a McDonalds in walking distance from my house. I should totally splurge. And good for you! I have a strong willpower if Im allowed to have a bite of something or a sip of something. If my friend is eating something and they offer me a bite Ill take it. Doesnt mess up my daily balances because I dont have enough friends with food XD and it satisfies my curiosity so I dont go order a whole meal like that for myself.,KetoDining,cfqfkbe,2,t5_2v8pd
