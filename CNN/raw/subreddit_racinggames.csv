They are very easy to get through.Much of the game does just revolve around driving around this giant world. There is just so much to do its crazy.  From finding barn finds to car clubs to events to road trips to photographing rare cars there is a shit load of content and its all super casual.,racinggames,crnv7qn,1,t5_2qx8o
