I can tell you right now they add a lot of cost onto gear and were in an industry dominated by new djs who refuse to pay for higher end gear.

32606,0,t1_cei4q05,i think it would be different if pioneer CDJs hadnt become one of the industry standards.  If for instance the Technics DZs hadnt had such a terrible launch and had become successful we would still be thinking of DJing as being intertwined with spinning platters.  But because pioneer managed to dominate the CDJ market nonmoving platters have become the defacto paradigm. I dont think it will ever get cheap.  Quality direct drive motors are a very specialized product and I just dont see it coming back enough that the prices will lower.I dont think it will ever die completely but I think it will become a very niche thing.  I can see that majority of clubs just abandoning their turntables eventually if they havent already a lot of techs in a lot of the clubs Ive played are in rough shape.  I think it will get to a point where the majority of DJs that want spinning platters will have to bring their own gear to shows.  ,Beatmatch,cei56ms,6,t5_2syix

529521,0,t3_205vrx,A couple of novice questions.    Why is a setup with CDJs and a separate mixer considered industrystandard when most DJs dont actually use CDs but digital audio instead or am I offbase on that?   What does that setup allow you to do that cant be done with a laptop and an S?   I may be reading this wrong but is there a stigma against having a laptop in your setup and using software to sync tracks instead of going laptopfree and beatmatching manually? I understand that one method demonstrates more skill than the other but if your primary goal at the end of the day is to put together a continuous mix with smooth songtosong transitions that wont throw off your audiences vibe why make it more difficult than it has to be? ,Beatmatch,cg0gp4f,2,t5_2syix
538338,0,t3_20au2k,For you having no notebook and wanting to go into the club scene I would recommend a CDJ setup. I chose the XDJR because it is very underestimated here. People sell it used with warranty for  off the retail price. It is the cheapest option if you want to go for rekordbox. The areo does offer quiet a bit less so that one was not an option for me. If you dont want the allinone unit you should go for s or s but already the s are probably over your budget even used. What you can do is look for some nonrekordbox players. s are a good choice there. Anyways the XDJR is the best deal for a tight budget. Of course it does not offer everything but the biggest downside probably is the short pitch faders. So you got to switch the tempo range if possible somtimes and can only pitch up to  max  with CDs though!. Anyways this issue and the missing manual looping ther is auto looping are pretty much the only real downsides. Therefore you get a lot of the basic functions some effects both color and beat fx and even things like a sampler and hot cues which pioneer did only implent on the R and its flagship CDJs. I cant coment on nonpioneer CDJs a lot but that might be an option as well. Obviously without rekordbox but often with a much lower price tagfeature set. ,Beatmatch,cg1gs4v,1,t5_2syix

708596,0,t3_2291d9,In order to make your setup work. You will have to have your program mix through external mode.  You will select one channel of your USB audio card for one deck A and the other for deck B. If you cannot aggregate your soundcard you can download ASIOALL and split up your soundcard to individual outputs.  You will need the cables that will convert whatever the soundcard output is headphone to RCA. Then plug in the RCA to their appropriate channels in your mixer.  Your speakers should be plugged into the mixer.  You will plug your headphone to the mixer for CUEing and use the mixer for EQing.  For deck transport unless you have a controller you will be using your computer for deck transport and pitch control. Hope this helps!,Beatmatch,cgktk0e,2,t5_2syix

Make sure to normalize your output either from Lives export or in some other tool I use Audacity. You can do a basic mix for loudness pass after everythings recorded if you want to using compressors and EQ on the master to try and slam it a little harder but its pretty easy to take the feel out in the name of loudness.

897955,0,t3_24ecsu,There are A LOT of things that are completely the same on CDJs and controllers at least when talking about Traktor Serato ... and not Ableton Live. The biggest one restricting yourself to your hardware which means you have to beatmatch manually. This is what makes the biggest difference. Apart from that the differences are not too big. Depending on the mixer you have a different system with the effects selecting amount etc. and of course you have different effects in general. There are a few things that influence the experience but not the skill too much eg. different platters bigger pitch faders etc.If you have a Mac things are a bit easier because you can just use Rekord Buddy to sync Traktor with Rekordbox instead of having two libraries. Concerning getting CDJs Well... obviously if you cant rent them you would have to buy unless you feel comfortable just practicing on your home system.The first time I EVER played on CDJs was in a rented small club for a friends birthday party. They had only s and a  mixer I think. Till than I only had my hands on an DDJSX which I sold a few month earlier and still it was great fun. Of course transitions were not best but thats not because I did not know where to find the correct buttons but because I had no experience. Anyways If you know how to manually beatmach dont need any screen usage apart from selecting new songs every now and than you are fine. If you want to get some CDJs anyway Consider buying an XDJR. That unit is really great for what you pay. I got two of them at home and the only thing I consider adding is an RMX . I payed  for each of them used which is a nobrainer for me.If you got more money to spend Id recommend getting one of the new lines s s s or s because the use rekordbox. s or s are recommendable if you dont want rekordbox for good pricevalue ratio.,Beatmatch,ch6cows,2,t5_2syix

1513779,0,t1_cj60ogd,gt Go and get some funk tracks from the internet... like old ones. Now put them in Traktor and press sync. Then listen to an epic trainwreckPut two old funk LPs onto some s. Drop the needle anyoldplace. Press play on both simultaneously. Listen to an epic trainwreck.See I can make manual deejaying sound terrible too its just that the process i describe bears no resemblance to what someone actually does when beatmatching LPs.Similarly theres scarcely a DJ in the real world who would just drop two unquantized songs into Traktor without beatgrids and expect it to work magically.

If you have been into music for awhile you might already have a good sense of it.A good way to think about it is like when you listen to a song and you just know a big change is coming that makes you throw your fist in the air or something. Usually those parts are the beginningending of a phrase. When you are mixing you will want to more often than not start your nd track at the beginning of a phrase on the first track. When you do this you will notice certain elements of the tracks match up.

If you are a dj that likes visual beatmatching go with Serato.  If you dont wantneed the visual aid then Traktor is probably a better choice IMO.

3265563,0,t1_cp0hlvc,Hey Soo!Firstly I love your posts and appreciate that you spend so much time helping out others in this thread! Your experience is invaluable for guiding us that havent yet had the time or opportunity to obtain that precious resource!I fully agree with what youre saying  especially the audiophile bit as so many of the clubs either have combfiltering issues shitty speakers ones that are designed to be LOUD rather than great sounding run in mono which is done for fully sane reasons but still affects the sound wayy more than the gain on a high quality installation mixer or run crazy aggressive limiters  compressors thanks Aoki!.The build quality is absolutely something I agree with as well! If youre doing this professionally its  worth investing money in yourself so you have something that can handle all the rigors of the road. Its why so many of us have duplicate laptops and hard drives and why a lot of the mobile guys I know carry a back up Set Up as well. Id also like to add here that getting equipment thats designed to be user maintainable and getting a proper case is key as well. After I quit to go back to school and didnt have room for a full DVS set up I picked up an original MTP as a casual practice  houseparty option and i know it wouldnt have gone the distance if I hadnt made sure I only carried and stored it in a case.  I think i wasnt being fully clear with what i meant which is that if you are performing occasionally in a club and  or are just starting your first residency lacking XLR outs isnt a huge deal breaker as they really only have a noticeable difference in interference rejection past  ft or at least thats what I remember reading? Not  on that number but it was bigger than what youd usually use as an interconnect and as I mentioned a lot of places prefer you leave the installation mixer there and plug into it with RCAs instead of plugging directly into the main outs at least in my experience!,Beatmatch,cp0i1q9,2,t5_2syix

3499442,0,t3_309z7q,Check out this mix Both tracks speed up at different rates and he uses just the pitch fader to bend the drums tempo to match the other record. Its a great exercise to beatmatch on the fly. The songs are Blackalicious  Alphabet Aerobics Instrumental and Apollo   Hall Of the Mad Mountain King if you want to try it.An exercise I give my students is picking an instrumental song and an acapella at different original tempos. Play the instrumental and drop the acapella at  and beatmatch the acapella on the fly to the instrumental. Its easy to hear when the acapella drifts because it sounds like the singer is either rushing or bored of singing. You can try matching with both the pitch and platter or just the pitch and find your own technique to beatmatch fast and bend when stuff sounds off.,Beatmatch,cpr5txf,3,t5_2syix

I use around  on my Traktor S and the pitch control is tiny as fuck it gets TOO sensitive sometimes.Ultimately if I had to pick just ONE method to use itd be pitchonly. It does everything pushing the platter does but if you have the technology in front of you go ahead and use the platter as much as you want. Just be aware itll make an obvious noise especially with keylockmaster tempo OFF if you nudge it too much so do it when the track isnt loud enough etc.,Beatmatch,cr5lw97,3,t5_2syix

4134302,0,t3_380ujj,I DJ with Ableton and have been for a couple years. Tempo is changed by hand which in my opinion is a huge benefit once you get the hang of it because you can adjust subtle variations in emotion based on the speed of a warped track. Its done by using a tempo mapped knob on a midi controller or the bpm control on your laptop. The versatility and on the fly response with Ableton comes with fades effects and dummy clips which makes performing a ton of fun. ,Beatmatch,crrj5rb,4,t5_2syix

4477986,0,t3_3byvi5,I honestly feel bad for people who dont learn how to beatmatch.  Why?  Not because of skill level or anything like that.Just because I think its half the fun of mixing.EQing is fun so are effects and obviously track selection but beatmatching is very engaging.  It really makes you listen to the tracks.It is hard at first but gets easier.   And once mastered it doesnt take long at all.  I just think its fun to ride the pitch throughout a mix.  I prefer stick shift cars too though.  I dont hate on people who sync though.  Its not for me but I totally understand why people use sync.  I can tell the difference between syncd and manual beatmatched sets and I prefer the live feel to the manually beatmatched sets more.   Its the human element that I like.   Syncd transitions all sound perfect.  Manually beatmatched sets have a little variation and tend to float over one another instead of being in perfect time.   This is probably because i grew up on vinyl and am older though.  Its just preference in the end.  I would advise people to at least try manual beatmatching just for the fun of it if nothing else.,Beatmatch,csv4av6,1,t5_2syix

6292195,0,t1_cz4raew,Congrats on the mix. I really like the choice of intro and outro. As the other comment said I liked the track selection especially Numb Encore. Maybe I was a bit amazed that you dug up that track since it came out in  when I was still a bedroom DJ.My only advice for future mixes is with electro house is that you should keep the energy going. Its a great mix but I personally got bored with the intro drop breakdown intro drop breakdown mixes at the first  minutes of the mix. Im not saying you should put drops back to back but with Electro House you have some flavors with putting together high energy. I think you should experiment with putting together buildups from  tracks. Track  has its build then drop then breakdown. Phrase match track  with its buildup and either mix it in using filter or using a slow volume fade to bring it in. Other thing that I suggest you try is putting a buildup from Track  during the drop of Track . That way you have the melodic drop going and then you have a buildup of the nd track going and when the drop of the st track ends the nd one comes in. Its a good technique to mix things up and keep the energy going. With those  techniques make sure to let the energy cooldown with a breakdown or a more simplistic mix. Its easy to overdo it and have a mix going at  energy for too long.Overall solid mix. Id give it a grade of B because Im impressed with your track selection  youve put together a good basic mix.,Beatmatch,cz4uoe9,2,t5_2syix

Really appreciate all the feedback you gave Im still practicing on making my transitions smooth with just the volume faders  EQs before I start using effects but definitely makes sense to smooth out the transition with an effect.Good point on using a loop to extend the intro of love wont sleep to ease the listener into the track rather than a sudden transition right after the vocal of its strange ends! Not super comfortable with loops yet but will definitely practice. same w dead into white liesI typically dont use the crossfader unless its to make a hard cut but I see your point on decreasing the volume of white lies once the violindrums comes in as I dont want to introduce that new element and then have it cut out too suddenly.

The problem with any art is that its never about the artist never about the audience  its about the connection that occurs between the artist and the audience through the medium. DJing is a performance art so it can be the same  yes even top DJing to a bunch of kids at a middle school dance.It could be that the crowd this time around just wasnt a dancing crowd or that they werent feeling like dancing and instead were going to be awkward about the whole thing. Or its possible that you as a fairly new DJ just didnt have the library or the crowdreading skills to really know what the crowd wanted to heardance to. You just werent able to build that connection with the crowd to get them moving for whatever reason.The good news is by the sounds of it you didnt really fuck up per se. You tried a few varieties see if you could spark something through a bunch of avenues and none of it worked. Keep in mind  EVERY DJ has an off night. I dont think theres anybody in this sub with a lick of experience that hasnt had at least a solid few complete bust sets myself included. Whether it be because you didnt have the right tunes for the crowd there wasnt enough people to form a critical mass to start people dancing the crowd was mostly dudes etc. lots of reasons it didnt work.Take from it try to learn from it  maybe expand your library a bit more and now you get to see why many DJs hate requests  frequently while the crowd thinks they want to hear a particular song it could potentially kill your dancefloor.st gig was a smashing success  thats positive! My first gig I had a similar experience my second gig was a tiny renegade stage at a forest rave and I never had more than  people dancing in front of me  so I just played music I loved and rocked out to it. Funny story many years later I was chatting with a friend of mine who told this story about how she was at this rave and found this little renegade stage with this DJ rocking the fuck out and how much she loved the idea of that situation. So lo and behold I definitely affected someone just by enjoying myself and playing fun tunes. So while it felt like that whole gig was a bit of a bust it made an impact.So just keep doing what youre doing. Youll figure it out.,Beatmatch,d2xov1m,1,t5_2syix
7553943,0,t1_d30h4aq,hi First things first i dont know why but i find your tapes name kinda funny which is a good thing.the first  transitions were clean and they made sense although they could have been cleaner if you experiment with the EQ more. by making sense i mean for example you go from flume to flume to flumehermitude to hermitude and they all had similar sounds in them which is always a satisfying thing. you and me to enigma i think you had clashing vocalsdont let me down to the next track was okay but it could have been way smoother what i sometimes do is i switch the first drop with the second drop using a cue point and then i phase the next track on top of the second drop or the outro so it turns out smooth. also i like how until now youve given me summer vibes but i think the original dont let me down would give more of a summer vibe but thats just my opinion. touched to ghenghis khan was the best transition i heard it was nice as you brought ghenghis khan in. i had not heard that remix before but its amazing im stealing it from you D ghenghis khan to controlla again was good but i think you need to phase it better so the vocals on controlla come in as soon as ghenghis khan ends. controlla is prolly one of my face tracks. i cried a lil when they cut popcaanlight it up is a gem but dont cut the second drop. imagine people are dancing and as that one by one for the people two by two for the sequel comes on youre expecting the drop which is so good but then you cut it out making people wait even longer for another drop which is not nearly as good as light it up. my advice  just blend cried away intro on light it ups second dropyou do that again from u amp i to pursuit of happiness. people would be expecting what comes on after that u amp i vocal so you can just mix the pursuit of happiness intro into a u amp i drop. overall a good mix i feel like the vibes were there. you need to phase your tacks better but the beat matching was great considering that you had tracks from different bpms. keep practicing i think you can totally build good sets. i gave you a follow on soundcloud. nurmur  ,Beatmatch,d30uihj,1,t5_2syix

Since then Ive been buying records that I either knew before or have discovered while listening to other DJ mixes either live or online.Ive practiced around  hours total at this point due to a heavy work schedule and noise sensitive neighbors. I try to get in an hour or two every week but its rarely been possible. Ive taped over the BPM counter and since I use vinyl only I dont really have any tools to help me. Ive done things this way because I want to start off by learning vinyl even though I realize the transition to more advanced electronic equipment probably is inevitable.Yesterday I finally got around to having a crack at an actual mix.

I thought your transitions overall were on point so far and I like the Drunken Masters so that was nice.  The future basstrap transition was the only one I questioned.  You need a pretty strong build up to make that transition work and I usually opt for a mashup mix to keep the flow steady.

You can either get cheapish turntables and the scratch A pack this will probably end up  depending if you buy used and how much you end up paying. OR you could get a CDJstyle midi controller depending on your location they can be as cheap as  bucks a piece they wont last forever but will surely do for learning beatmatching. ,Beatmatch,d3akccl,2,t5_2syix

7888773,0,t1_d42b9l4,Ive never used Serato sadly but as far as Im aware Serato requires controllers that are set up for Serato the same way that say an iPhone can only download programs for iPhone from the Apple store but an Android can use other third party software if set up for that.  I really like traktor because its pretty cheap and you can personalize the mapping for any controller.  It has a lot of built in presets for a large number of controllers and if that doesnt work you can either personally map the buttons and knobs and whatnot or go on traktorbible.com to see if somebody else made and exported a mapping.  As far as Im aware neither of them has a particular advantage over the other in terms of capabilities but somebody please correct me if Im wrong.  Really I think its mostly up to personal preference but Ill put it this way Traktor has a fabulous integration between hardware and software that Virtual DJ for example doesnt.  It is very diverse and allows you to change a lot of very specific settings and you can customize the layout usage and overall properties of the software pretty easily.,Beatmatch,d42rrp9,2,t5_2syix
7889661,0,t3_4nc0ie,I think the most important thing is to balance the volume between your cue ear and your open ear. A lot of people crank their headphones up too much and that can drown out your open ear in a way. Its hard to explain but I would recommend keeping your headphones as low as possible while still hearing them of course.  Sometimes for me I would also eq most of the bass out of the cue track in order to better hear the other parts of the music. Most decks I have seen have a pulse to them meaning they dont stay put at one speed rather they fluctuate a bit. If you take a time code record and play it in serato the software will show you if your deck is pulsing. Its not really that big of a deal as long as youre aware of it and its not too bad.  Tunes make a distinct sound when theyre too fast versus too slow. I come from a Dnb world and the hi hats are what tells me this.Whenever I try a new record I match the pitch setting of the other deck and start beat matching from there. A lot of tunes are fairly similar in speed.,Beatmatch,d42vd5m,3,t5_2syix

For this style it works fine to wait to switch tracks until right at the drop which avoids that issue entirely. If that was the only change you made to this mix it would be significantly improved.Seems like you started a bit rough but found your groove around  minutes in.. two bars early bass? . dont even bring it in until drop at .. phrase match. wait until . or even . to bring it in.  . trainwreck. is passable but a bit jarring. is a bit weird rhythmically . is better place to bring it in maybe beat matching issue?. bass? phrase matchingedit sorry about the formatting I dont know how to make it more listy.,Beatmatch,d60pti9,1,t5_2syix

8687126,0,t3_4yi3a0,one of the things about playing records out in clubs is that you become more particular about wherehow the turntables are going to be set up.  what is the floor like? is it solid? will it bounce if  people are jumping up and down? will the TTs be on a table? what kind of table? suspended from the ceiling or on the ground? are the decks too close to the subwoofer? eight rolls of packing tape and a bag of fat rubber bands will be your best friend.  if you dont know what Im talking about...think about it for a minute  works really well for feedback suppression too! if anyone asks where you learned the trick just say an old philly house head taught me.dont forget to rebalance your tonearm weight when you set up. if youre at all nervous it might jump dial it up an extra gram for the night. pack an extra cartridge andor stylus if youve got one. tbh a simple skip on a record is something barely anyone notices and if the vibe is tight everyone will just dance right through it. it happens from time to time. just ignore it. if its a fuzzball on the needle try to gently blow it off GENTLY! but keep a lint free cloth on hand to wipe down your records as you put them on.  acting like a skip on a record is some sort of grave catastrophe only reinforces to the dancefloor that youve just committed a grave catastrophe. shrug and let it pass.  i cant give you any assurance as to whether or not it will be a colossal fuck up. no one can. its all part of the fun honestly! dont be afraid to allow yourself to enjoy it D no one likes a DJ who looks like theyre trying really hard to take a shit. ,Beatmatch,d6rinkq,1,t5_2syix

8874934,0,t3_516cj6,I just wrote up something on how to learn this skill so Ill copy pastaYou should work on learning phrasing and counting beats like a DJ and identifying the difference in drums. You need to be able to listen to a track and easily identify the kick and snare in particular. Go get some samples of like a Roland  kick and snare as those are pretty popular sounds especially in Hip Hop and Trap and just play them so you know exactly what they sound like.Here is how to count There are a few different methods for beat counting here is the method I like                                                                                                                                                                                                        This counting in a grid means that you will hit  bars at the  th row this should be a small change in the song and when you finish the entire grid count you hit  bars so that should be a major change in the song. After  beats that is when your transition point is.You should start off with counting House or Techno based music before you get into breakbeat music like Dubstep Trap and Hip Hop. Its a lot easier to count housetechno based  on the floor music you just have to count every kick. For breakbeat music you typically count the snare but they often will mute a snare or two which makes it harder and they could use something totally different than the snare too like a wood block or just some interesting sample.So for the next few weeks you should try to listen to house and techno and for each and every track do the beat grid counting I showed you above.After you do this for about  tracks more or less it starts to become second nature. You will then no longer have to think about where phrases are. At this point you should start learning how to count breakbeat.After youve done this for  or more tracks youll be easily able to pick out the start and end points of a phrase for a song youve never even heard before. At that point youve mastered DJ beatphrase counting.,Beatmatch,d7en4cj,3,t5_2syix

It can be run as a standalone  channel mixer without software.HOWEVER For you I think its the wrong choice because the hot cues looping etc is not very user friendly and requires the use of a control key to toggle between different functions on the same buttons. If beatmatching is what you want to focus on Id prob get something else. Also the effects are somewhat fun to play with but I dont think theyre worth specifically purchasing this controller for. Hopefully Im articulating this in a way that makes sense  As far as what I do which is less performance based and more about playing the right songs for events and making them flow and sound good this board fits the bill for me and I really like the small form factor that is really close to the width of my laptop.

10380553,0,t1_dcjyy2j,I get where youre coming from. I never used a controller and didnt mean for the question to sound condescending. A used pair of CDJMKs can be found for  and works exactly like a CDJ with all buttons and knobs in the same location. If you know how to use a CDJ you know how to use every CDJ. Guitar Center offers a  day return policy with no restocking fee on used gear you eat the cost of shipping if gear is out of state so if youre goal is to be  comfortable it seems extremely likely youll know how to mix on CDJs within the return policy. But in the past  years the price for used CDJs has stayed the same and I dont think blank CDs are going up in price soon.This advice is from personal experience and I currently own a pair of CDJs and have owned the s s and s. Ive played on everything except a controller. I dont have much experience with CDJs because the early models would freeze  from excessive vibration which is why you dont see s on a main stage but maybe the newer models fixed this issue or the unit I used was defective. They began to work after placing towels and shirts under them to limit the vibration. CDJMK Pair   Guitar CenterDJM   Chicago CraigslistCDRs   for ?Burn the playlist you would have on your flash drive onto CDs to practice on s and bring the CDs with you in case you misplace or damage your flash drive.

10400897,0,t3_5ojz35,Using s with any of the DJM series mixers will more than prepare you for using CDJ s and a DJM . There are some new bellswhistles and improvements on the new models but its all essentially the same. If youre worried about cost it may be worth renting a pair of CDJs for a day to get comfortable. Or better yet connect with one of the other DJs youve seen use CDJs and see if you can meet up for a practice session sometime. Personally I dont own CDJs though Id like to invest in a pair but I use them at clubsbars whenever theyre available. Youll be fine making the transition to them most controllers are made as an approximation of a traditional DJ set up anyway so it wont take a ton of time for you to get comfortable. And of course the more you use CDJs the better youll get at it.,Beatmatch,dcn0b8n,1,t5_2syix

You can however use them with Serato but then you need a usb mixer that can be mapped as well.. The message your getting about saving the files the one on the image you linked. Go select that song in its folder open its properties and change it from read only to read and write I believe its called.Edit Just realized you said you already did this. I guess Id double check everything.. As far as the sampling rate and album artwork.. theres no way around it keep doing what your doing.. You can save hot cues for tracks but you need to give the player a series of commands. Read the manual for that. Using the hot cues on the fly in a mix will save that place in that song even when you load another track so youll just have to clear it if you dont have time to save it.Edit Break points in ddjmm are hot cue points if im not mistaken I never really use them with my s tho.Hope this helped a bit.,Beatmatch,dcsuehd,1,t5_2syix

10632412,0,t3_5s562c,I really think you should sit down and watch some tutorials on how to scratch before you try scratching or asking questions on here.quick answer.  You dont press play and then scratch.  You have the sample running and hold it in place with the jog wheel.  There are some scratches that are done with the sample not playing but work up to those.just watch these and practiceDont get ahead of yourself and start at lesson  and dont move on to the next lesson until youve mastered the scratch.You are already starting at a disadvantage by using a controller and especially one that doesnt have a great platter for scratching to begin with. ,Beatmatch,ddcni4o,6,t5_2syix
10647418,0,t3_5sbrnq,It develops over time but an easy way to go about it is remembering which songs tend to fit together nicely. So instead of thinking of songs to cue on the fly have combos of  songs that you know tend to work together ,Beatmatch,dde76k5,3,t5_2syix

10711636,0,t3_5t6q0d,Well house and techno are definitely easier than drum amp bass and dubstep.  Thats because house and techno are very straightlinear genres on the beat.  These genres are called  on the floor because for  bars of music you get  kick drums exactly on beat.  To count beats in those genres you just have to count the Kick drum which is easier.Dubstep and Drum amp Bass are called breakbeat genres along with Trap and Hip Hop.  These genres you usually count on the snare but they are also far more creative in the drums and its easy to get lost counting.So if you want to start with whats easier and makes more sense stick to house and techno first later on you can learn breakbeat.You can easily become a decent DJ in roughly  hours of practice.  You should definitely be good enough for a house party if you put in the effort.  Thats about  hours of practice a week for  months  probably a lot less hours than you watch TV or play video games per week if you are like most of us ,Beatmatch,ddktpln,4,t5_2syix

Here we go!Here is a drawing of my set up.This works for me normally because I can play with the S and output through the PC into my amp and speakers.  The DJIO allows me to use the headphones with the S no problem.  Cue works everything works fine.Here is a pic of my audio set up and  output routing through Traktor Pro.And finally here is the audio choices I get in OBS.  Whatever I use it always picks up the cue channels so all my cueing is transmitted on the OBS audio.Whew!,Beatmatch,ddudwc2,1,t5_2syix
10804865,0,t1_dduenui,Theres being cheaper and then theres undercutting.  My weddings usually start at around  so a good discount for inexperience would be say  less.  Lowballing to that extreme isnt good for you or the DJs around you as can gain a rep for being the cheap dj which makes it harder to get away from when you want to start charging more.  It can also piss off your competition  which can often be a good source of gigs if you network correctly.That said I would just take my lumps and do it for the amount you stated because increasing your prices right after you quoted something simply isnt a good look  even if its by a bit.  Just keep it in mind for future negotiations.Another thing to consider with your rig.  Mic feedback generally tends to be in a higher frequency range  youll clip a lot more when you start push the bass  which a lot of modern music does.  So just because the feedback that blew your amp was really really loud  it doesnt mean that your music has to be that loud to blow out your speakers.  Keep an eye on your speakers set a good gain stage and learn the limits and dont go above it even if people are screaming at you to turn it up.,Beatmatch,ddug22h,2,t5_2syix

10829865,0,t1_ddwzy8r,Hip hop generally needs bass so subs are recommended but it also depends on the party and location.  If a ton means  people spread out you dont need to bring shit tons of sounds.  Likewise if its a backyard in a residential neighbourhood you also probably wont want to bring like  high powered  subs.  If its in a secluded area and like  are there and they all want to dance then youll need to bring serious sound.Also if its a friend of a friend I would be charging for at least the gear.

11037794,0,t3_5x5qyi, vinyl feels easier to control than a  or  jogwheel. Can use all four fingers instead of two and do wacky shit with your palm. Having a physical chunk of material in front of you also means you can do wacky stuff like bending the platter or tapping the platter to do weird effects. IMHO more applicable for turntablists but I admire those that can incorporate turntablism into modern sets and still keep it all sounding musical. The needle is also following a physical track a physical manifestation of the track playing even on DVS. You know your coarse position on the track from where the needle is on the tracks and if you put a marker on your vinyl you can know the fine position of the track by watching the marker spin around and tracking that. Potentially much more useful than jogwheel displays.ATLP would not be worth it. If you pick up a turntable pick up something nice and designed for the task like a SL better motors more durable takes a small step back from the audiophile grade of turntables and adds a bunch of durability and the ability to be used in ways vinyl was never designed to be used in.IMHO if youre not interested in putting in the time to learn turntablism though dont go for it. I didnt. I think its really cool but definitely not something Id dump time into getting good at just doesnt pop up enough when Im having fun that I justify it.

11214837,0,t3_603jce,What are the odds you can press play at the exact timing the kick happens? Beatmatching is matching the kicks together and iirc advanced beatmatching is doing that while adjusting the tempo for when you dont know the bpms of the songs. Its an important skill to have. Its like being able to drive anywhere without using a GPS. Sure a GPS helps you get you to where you wanna be but what if your GPS fails or is unavailable? Its better to not rely on machines. Instead trust your own skill. ,Beatmatch,df36shg,11,t5_2syix

11429612,0,t3_62lu8c,Not to lead you away from buying a headphone but personally I dont notice that big of a difference when it comes to djing since Im not  using them all the time. I take it off listen to only one side etc. Ive had good experience with Audio Technica although my ATHMs cord kinda broke in two places. Theyre kinda bulky and not really great for only listening to one side since theyre so big itd either have to go over my ear or it would slide to the back of my head.Id give the ms a shot and if you dont think you need to drop so much try some cheaper headphones. I have a pair of beats that came with my laptop that I bring around when I mix. I dont care too much if they break and they fit really comfortably. Small so I dont really notice it either. At home I have a pair of HDs that I use solely for listening since theyre so big itd be a hassle to dj with them. Maybe even consider some cheap swivel dj headphones?
