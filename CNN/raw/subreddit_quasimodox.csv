7934837,0,t1_d47w54a,I learned this new CSS magic the header would look normal on all screens with different sizes. The left side would always have ryu mountains on the left the title is in the middle and the background doesnt have repeated pattern. Also i learned to set minimum width so all layers dont get squeezed together. Simple shit but big step for me! D,quasimodox,d47y83z,1,t5_3ez7p
