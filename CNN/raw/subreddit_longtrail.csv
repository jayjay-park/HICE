914180,0,t3_24kz48,Its still mud season in VT so you will need to reconsider your plans. The state outright closes the LT on both summits you mentioned to protect the alpine ecosystem. Sorry to be a bummer but you would really risk damaging the soil if you were to hike those peaks right now. ,longtrail,ch8759s,1,t5_2ws6p
10293603,0,t3_5ndf71,The Northville placid trail is pretty flat comparatively. Id say your average will probably be a little less  or so. I really think Killington to mansfield is some of the best hiking Ive done. Oh and yellow deli in rutland is worth a stay really interesting place.,longtrail,dcau3gi,2,t5_2ws6p
