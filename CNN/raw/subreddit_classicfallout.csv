I did this by repeatedly reloading the area until they were spread out and using a sniper rifle to kite them a little bit while trying to crit the eyes.

He may be lying that the vault dweller was the only person who had the ability to save them they obviously could have sent someone else.

4682278,0,t3_3f2kk7,The answer depends on your system.A few years ago Apple dropped driver support for ATI graphics cards in Apple systems at lower color levels such as  colors. This resulted in a game that launched but when the game was started there was nothing more than a white or black screen displayed.Nvidia drivers were still able to run the two early Fallouts for a while but I havent tested FO with Nvidia recently and that may now be deprecated as well. I could try this evening when I get home and reload the original FO but Im expecting to be disappointed.So its not a matter of the OS per se but the graphics hardware and driver support in the OS that prevents modern Macs from running FO and FO.I wouldnt take the risk.,classicfallout,ctkqx0v,1,t5_2uh6v

6681138,0,t3_4757b7,If all you want is XP I find the deathclaws are not appreciably more deadly than a swarm of mantises once youve the armor for it. Two deathclaws at once of course is a bit more problematic.If you want cash you can usually do well just gambling at the Maltese Falcon. Slot machines are lovely if your Luck and Gambling are high enough. Ive never tried to get by on Gambling skill alone its probably the only relevant factor but Im uncertain.An advantage to each of these is time. In realtime pushing the  key down with a paperclip can yield you caps over several hours but in game time its almost instantaneous. Perfect as a first stop in the games beginning phase when time is limited and resources few. The deathclaws meanwhile respawn within hours which pass in an instant in realtime if you havent entirely stemmed the tide.Mind if you simply need a large cash infusion theres always the Friendly Lending Company. Borrow a small sum immediately pay it back borrow the newly available larger sum pay it right back etc. until youre holding a cool thousand. Then wary of their remarkable capacity for violence and the dangers of high calibre flying lead kill them. If the violence doesnt spill out into the street nobody cares.,classicfallout,d0adzsg,7,t5_2uh6v

7404877,0,t3_4gqi7s,Energy weapons are often viewed as not good because you dont get a good one for a long time. However later in the game the turbo plasma rifle pulse weapons and alien blaster are very good. I believe the alien blaster has the highest damage to ap used ratio of any single shot weapon in the game vs anything but floaters. I have Marcus and Vic using turbo plasma rifles and they are about as effective as Cassidy with a gauss rifle while also using far more common ammo. If you can get past the range the alien blaster outperforms the gauss pistol by a hefty margin with a typical fast shot sniper build.,classicfallout,d2jvwhe,14,t5_2uh6v

9414477,0,t3_59gt7g,Once you obtain a perk you keep the perk regardless of later changes to ability scores.Skill scores start at a value based on a formula that varies for each skill but usually includes an ability score. For example starting Small Guns skill is Agility times four  . This value changes if your ability scores change. You then later increase skills using free skill points and this has nothing to do with any formula so that part never changes.So lets say your starting Agility was . This means your character started with a Small Guns of .

Most of Poseidons most promising research projects never reached their final stages however.Though ultimately not a part of the Enclave many powerful corporations benefited from the Enclaves actions and their research facilities were shielded from the atomic firestorm of .Again it would make a lot of sense for them to store backup parts for their most expensive equipment like maybe an oil tanker?
