49684,0,t3_1uo935,Its going to be an exciting year for big  fans. I believe any of the top  teams could pull it out. If you can get trough the conference schedule with only  losses you should be in good shape for a share or out right win. OSU losing its starting center for the year and back up PG hitting the hippie lettuce will not help. They are very talented and should be able to overcome that KSU is interesting after the start they got off to. Now they have a couple of talented freshman starting to take shape and the emergence of their new PG at semester.  Should be a good game Saturday. Iowa State is a hungry team that is very talented and hard the to beat at home. They lost a ton of close games last year and handled Baylor pretty soundly tonight. Kansas is young and loaded with talent but so far have struggled to play a solid D and had a lot of turnovers. They have played the hardest non conference schedule in the NCAA this year and should pay dividends for them this conference season but we titles In a row looks though. This may be the hardest year. Baylor is also good but I dont believe their coach can take them the distance he seems to struggle with devising game plans and has plenty of talent year in and year out.  Not to mention OU and Texas both look good so far this year. It will be an exciting year to say the least.,CollegeBasketball,cek34rp,2,t5_2rj3j

Just because Duke lost doesnt mean anything to Kansas or Kentucky. Dont lump us in with them. Kentuckys freshmen had some bad habits that theyre getting rid of and as a result Kentucky is coming around. Kansas had an overhyped player come in and is probably dealing with some of what Kentucky is dealing with. Duke is an unbalanced roster physically that is probably the worst team defensively Ive ever seen coach K put out on the floor. Kentucky is doing just fine and its still more likely than not that theyll make it far in the tournament and Im willing to say the same of Kansas. Youre acting like theyve got losing records.

100680,0,t1_cepw1lw,AlieCoxs was one of the most obvious pushoffs youll ever see.   hands in the back tried to do it on the sly.  I didnt feel that the refs swayed the game too far either way.  Often GW turned over the resulting possession as well on tickytack fouls.The one area I would have thought youd have the most fair complaint is out of bounds calls which I thought went wrongly against you the bulk of the time yet you didnt bring that up at all.  Make no mistake Im not saying it was a perfectly officiated game Im just saying I think there were plenty of areas that youd be assessing what you need to correct first before you go after the refs.   One particular sequence that miffed me was when you guys had a nocall on a missed layup that I actually agreed with but then a weaker foul was called at the opposite end.  May have been the Burgess call.  I also laughed at the GW fans that thought your man had flopped on Armwoods baseline drive charge that was rightfully called offensive and his th PF that was pretty clear.I dont like that defense is more heavily scrutinized either but sadly it is always going to be.  For what its worth Larsen was hit with  PFs on Saturday v. URI for moving screens and he noticeably and successfully made a conscious effort to avoid such infractions as well as fouls under the basket on layup  contests which I felt the refs seemed to reward him for today.  Edit  This isnt a knock at you at all but personally I hate the phrase act like youve been there.    Its not like the players were joining the celebrations they went right back to the locker room    The connotation of that phrase for me is exactly everything NCAA basketball should not be.  Professional sports?  Sure I guess.  But its college let em enjoy it.  This is an RPI top  win in a pivotal conference matchup between two RPI top  teams.  Not exactly something that comes along in the A regularly and even if it were who cares?  Its a big win rush every time... why not?  If nothing else Im all for letting people let off steam in a sporting arena vs. somewhere more precarious later on... you never know.  However... I went to a D school and I am insanely passionate about sports so I may be biased due to having missed out on these types of opportunities.,CollegeBasketball,cepw5wn,4,t5_2rj3j

184337,0,t1_cezf5is,Eh Shabazz has been good but I dont think its a shocking omission. He has a really high usage rate and KenPom favors efficiency over volume scoring for the most part. If you score  but you only shot  percent then hes not gonna reward you for that. Shabazzs effective FG is th in the country which isnt really good enough to merit inclusion as a player of the year candidate especially under his algorithms. In KPs ORtg metric which is sort of like PER he is th. He is just not as statistically valuable as some other players. Taking directly from an earlier post about his kPOY standingsgt The kPOY is not meant to predict who will win the Naismith or Wooden awards. This is a standalone honor designed to identify the most valuable player in the game free of reputation future potential or amount of times the player appears on Big Monday.So all in all theres a lot of different things that go into this but you have to remember that this is done without opinion eye test or anything of the sort.

189488,0,t1_cezvjrv,Ive never had Clemsons food but youre just gonna have to take it from someone who had a meal plan all four years not by choice had to have one where I lived that the food is bad. The same things are served daily and the lack of variety hurts a lot. The food is always under or over cooked. Its a source of constant complaint from students. Whats funny is that we actually use the same food provider as VT. But what I think makes the difference is that at VT students make a majority of the food from what Ive seen in many visits and heard from many friends. At UVA people who are adults who live in Charlottesville make most of the food and they make only a sliver about minimum wage. I also think it makes a difference that at VT student dining money can talk. They order a dish and pay for it albeit at a very low price. At UVA we use a buffet free for all swipe system so dining services has a harder time determining what foods are actually popular and which are just being thrown away in masse by students this happens because they took one bite and it was nasty but since they didnt pay for it as a dish and can just go get something else what is the incentive to complain?.,CollegeBasketball,cf00tcl,3,t5_2rj3j

229902,0,t3_1wqug6,I had a somewhat similar situation come up when SU lacrosse played my current school in the NCAA tourney last year.  Grew up my entire life rooting for Syracuse and now they were playing my new home.  I really had no clue who I was going to root for until the game started and I was more excited about SU losing than winning.  That was the first and likely last unless we randomly play SU again in some sport which is highly unlikely I think lacrosse is the only thing we are both good enough at to meet in a tourney time I will root against SU.  I of course am going to say root for your friends on the team i.e. SU but the other compromise would be to cut those each in half and sew them together or the less permanent version of taking one and folding it halfway back in on itself and then putting it onto of the other so it looks like you are wearing two halfshirts safety pins can be used to secure it.,CollegeBasketball,cf4ksal,1,t5_2rj3j

KU plays such an easy backhalf of the Big  schedule that there wont be that many more opportunities for a loss to learn from and while Texas will be one game back in the standings should they do what it looks like they will and win it doesnt do much to loosen Kansass stranglehold on the Big  because of the type of schedule Kansas has remaining.

265946,0,t1_cf8995c,Anderson seemed to attribute BCs late run to the teams hesitance to adjust to the way the game was being officiated  gt On the game as a whole  It was a hard fought game. I think we came out with force on defensive and got the ball going. We started getting more stops. There at the end it was touchy. They were getting uncontested shots and we were playing almost safe trying to let the clock run down. We pulled it off.gt On playing with foul calls  It is tough to get in the rhythm when it is called like that. I think as a good team  one of the best things for us to do is to try to adjust. I think we did a pretty good job at that but we could have been better. It is going to be a different ball game every time we step on the court. We need to do a better job of keeping our hands up and hands off and just adjust.  But you are also right that free throw shooting was ghastly and certainly a contributing factor as well. We should have won by  even with the fouls and hesitant defense. ,CollegeBasketball,cf8bpw7,3,t5_2rj3j

He spent a lot of his own time developing his game. Was a diamond in the rough for sure. I really hope Vonlehs potential is somewhat fulfilled all things aforementioned.Sorry guys. I am off the Crean hypetrain. Our successes have literally just been great players rolling into Bloomington in recent years...but we couldnt fully utilize what weve had.edit this wasnt a direct response to your post.

Illinois really didnt play that poorly in other aspects of the game but they got absolutely rained on from  and provided no counterpunch.  The numbers were meant to show that the discrepancy in  point prowess alone can account for the final score difference  in other words Michigans  point shooting coupled with Illinois lack of carried them to victory.

In fact I would go as far  to say that I would rather have just Embiid than Embiid and Turner. There simply wouldnt be enough minutes to go around for our post guys if we had Embiid Turner Alexander Ellis Traylor Mickelson and Lucas. Any one of those guys would be starting talent at almost every other school in the country and yet were so spoiled that we have all of them.Worst case scenario is that Embiid leaves and Turner signs somewhere else. Wed still start Ellis and Alexander and have Traylor Lucas and Mickelson on the bench. That would still be the best post rotation in the Big XII. My ideal starting lineup for next year is to have Tharpe at point Selden at shooting guard Ellis at small forward Alexander at power forward and Embiid at center. Id really like to see Eliis move to the  because he defends way better on the perimeter and is currently our most consistent midrangept shooter.Then we would have Mason and Frankamp able to back Tharpe or Selden and Oubre Greene and White III to back Selden or Ellis.

Heck with the fines that we have in place I honestly dont see why South Carolina rushed the court after beating Kentucky. Sure its a top  team but it doesnt mean anything at all when you are .

I dont have any knowledge of whether they turned down an invitation for the NCAA tournament Ive never heard of Army doing that but there was awhile when that wouldnt be surprising. The NIT came first and was the more prestigious of the two tournaments for a time. Teams would regularly turn down the NCAA tournament in favor of the NIT. They were selected as the champion by the Helms Foundation during WW I think . Maybe thats when they turned down an invitation?

Kenyatta Smith injury hurt depth a bit but this team is really strong.  Nobodys going to take them lightly during the tournament.Arizona State Have a few really nice pieces...Jahii Carsons a great point guard who makes up for his size with really nice athleticism.There are a lot of teams that I like but these are a few that have stood out to me recently.,CollegeBasketball,cg0gt98,2,t5_2rj3j

I think we were only down  or  points with  minutes left. Aaron Craft came storming down the court on a fast break and barreled into Basil Smotherman who was OBVIOUSLY very obviously already in position to take the charge near the point line. They of course called a blocking foul Craft hit both FTs of his  and it was downhill from there. Most people watching that game agreed that that call changed the outcome of that game.

569916,0,t1_cg4tpg5,gtThey knew they just didnt care.No matter how awesome Greenberg was he was also toxic and was destroying the program. He would not have done much better over the last two years. What VTs basketball team is today is mostly owed to Greenberg.Weaver did not fire him because he was not good enough. For some reason the notion persists that VT fired him because he failed to make the NCAA tourney and thought they could do better with JJ. This is false and idiotic.Weaver fired him because he had driven all his assistants away literally every single one he had driven away talent had antagonized the AD and donors and had basically shit the bed. No amount of wins short of routine national titles would have saved him. Oh and he also went  in conference his last year.gt Their previous AD Weaver really screwed their BB program by canning Greenberg and then hiring JJ with no time to recruit before peacingout.Firing Greenberg was unavoidable. The timing was totally fucked. Also the choice to save money by hiring JJ was incredibly stupid. You can take a risk on an upandcomer if you have a well established program that recruited based on reputation alone   VT was not that never was. VT needed a big name coach who could immediately recruit based on his own reputation. That costs money which VT was unwilling to invest. Instead they hoped that JJ would be able to field a decent team but they knew he was not going to be a regular participant in the NCAA tournament.TLDR So yes Greenberg situation was very poorly handled bad overall strategy terrible timing but firing Greenberg was probably justified due to his offcourt behaviour. He was not fired because of performance there was no expectation for JJ to do better.,CollegeBasketball,cg51yzz,2,t5_2rj3j

This years iteration underachieved all season and had to play a first round playin. We played great in the NCAA tournament and had chances late to make it to the Elite Eight.Next season. Jarnell seemingly is gone. All of the workhorses of this team will either be in the NBA or graduated. Recruiting has been way down. The cupboard will be empty. We will more than likely be calling for Cuonzos head again. Next season he will be giving pitches to schools to hire him instead of Marquette a basketball school coming for him. I dont want Cuonzo to leave but if he does adios and via con Dios. At best this is a lateral move for him.

Perhaps being on the team his teammates the school the coaching staff the location or whatever elsecombination are more appealing to him than leaving to get burn. You have to sit out an entire year its a relative gamble on if youll click with the new program like the new school enjoy the new location. Even then the only guarantee of getting a starting spot on your remaining years probably means transferring to a not very good program.Maybe he doesnt think hell ride the pine for all four years. Maybe he thinks he can improve enough to start getting time and sees the commitment as worthwhile. Ive been a high school lacrosse coach for five years now and EVERYONE thinks they deserve more PT or after a year or two will be at the point where they get more PT. Very rarely do I have a kid who plays for more than one year with the knowledge that they will never play. Now bring that mentality to someone who is actually good at basketball good enough to make it to UK and obviously they probably arent sitting around thinking In my four years here Ill never be good enough to see the court. I dont know anything about this particular player but Im sure hes not a scrub. He probably will have a role at some point in his career.Theyve made the national championship two times in three years and are returning a killer roster.

931965,0,t1_ch9n70q,The only problem I see with referencing Donovan is that despite his MASSIVE success basketball is still second fiddle to football. Even when they are doing badly there is more interest in the gridiron than the hardwood. I feel like thats the point natidude was making some coaches would not be satisfied having great success and still being less important than football. They want to be at the helm of the universitys premier sport. There are quite a few schools that are good to great at multiple sports but its typically obvious what the real school sport is yknow? Just as you reference Tennessee their basketball has had more recent success yet their support at least as I perceive it for basketball is still less than that of football. Although losing Pearl certainly didnt help that. It takes a lot to elevate a sport to the forefront of a university and some coaches dont want to struggle with that uphill battle.

Any my team plays a higherprofile Pac matchups highprofile national matchups and then matchups expected to be close.  I rely on KenPoms ThrillScore a lot when picking out games to watch.By the end of last season I had seen almost every tournament team except for the smaller conference champs play a regular season game at some point in the season.College basketball is my baby and I like to get as much of it as I can while the seasons in session.Ill continue to watch college football on Saturdays and Ill watch the marquee bowl games.  When college basketball ends I watch baseball but its a much more casual thing.  I dont get too terribly passionate about it but Ill flip on a game while folding clothes or whatever.

2613690,0,t1_cmzm27a,Its about as close as you can get and could be called either way depending on the official. His hand is about as far down as it can be without being considered under the ball other officials would be discrepant on that. So at that point you have to determine whether or not the ball came to a resting point during the crossover which in my opinion it doesnt.For me its not a carry...but its pretty damn close.,CollegeBasketball,cmzqwjj,4,t5_2rj3j
2616964,0,t1_cmz96pj,agreed. I also think KO is far more likely than other coaches to let guys play through things and work them out on his own and i think a lot of it has to do with him putting a huge emphasis on getting better each game figuring out his team and getting them to play a winning stylepeak march. I also agree with our Duke friend that UC could get to the elite . They dont look good now but of the  losses against WVU they played with basically  guys  with real college experienceWVU pressed and confused the youngsterswore the team down. They lost at the buzzer at home to a top  team and lost by  on a neutral site to the  team in america and held them to  shooting. The yale loss is terrible no two ways about it but even that required an incredible shot w  second left from a kid who was  until that point. Things are not good but they are far from terrible and are certainly fixablethey arent going to rain s this year and need someone to take a load of boatright who cannot play  minutes and control the ball every possession AND be a top  player...but the silly plays defensive lapses and lack of cohesion offensively are all things that can be fixed. Boatrightkeep doing what youre doing maybe look to dish a little moreHamiltonBE MORE AGGRESSIVE. He will get better on Dpretty good on ball but losses focus at other times and isnt ready for rotationsbut he needs to hunt his shot a bit more amp be ready to catch and shootFaceyKeep doing what your doing. Grab rebounds go up with it make the dirty plays. Like the rest of them communicate better on D. Apparently hes got a pretty good stroke ideally he starts hitting  footers by the end of the yearthink he will break out next year and amaze people. BrimahObviously must be smarter with fouls. Will struggle with powerful bigs needs to make himself available for that lob on every possession. Will keep getting better game by gamehim and Facey have the potential to be very good next year. PurvisHe is not a bad basketball player. He has skills. His biggest problem aside from missing  months is understanding who he is as a player. I think Ollie gives him leash bc thats who Ollie is and he knows RP needs to be at his best in march for this team to have a chance. But he needs to push every chance he gets and take it to the hole every chance he gets. He needs to learn that he should NEVER take a long two and should only shoot s wide open off a pass. Ideally hes the th man who comes in to defend like an animal push the pace and drive drive drive. Its really all decision making and with another  months Ollie has plenty of time to get that in his head. CassellThink Duke was too athletic for him and he needs to be smarter with shot selection and knock down some s but hes another guy who should be able to score  a gameall about decisions.SamuelHe is what he isth or th man who can be disruptive on D and should be able to get to the holedish but is hurt bc teams can clog the lane bc only Boat and Dham are threats from deep. Just keep playing his game D D D get the the hole make the extra pass. CalhounWho knows at this point his goal when he gets in the game is do whatever i have to to helpD rebounds steals slashing. But really if he can just make a game it opens everything up. In sum they have the pieces but are very inexperience both at the D level AND in terms of playing with each other. The D by March will be very very good bc thats what KO does. The ability of Purvis to focus on just doing what he does well Brimah to continue developing and one of CassellCalhoun to hit open s. Overall though its not time to panic we have the entire team coming back next year outside boat and are the DEFENDING NATIONAL CHAMPIONS. ,CollegeBasketball,cn06c46,1,t5_2rj3j

2629751,0,t1_cn1te2m,Its not a very complex model. It can predict future outcomes but it wont predict how the teams might have progressed or regressed throughout the season. Homecourt advantage is four points based on findings from Harville and Smith in The HomeCourt Advantage How Large is it and Does it Vary from Team to Team?  I would adjust homecourt advantage for each team but thatd be a pretty daunting task and it wouldnt improve the accuracy of the system by a significant amount. The major downfall of my system is that nothings automated because...well...Im not capable of creating an automated system. So unlike Ken Pomeroy I cant predict much outside of the result of Team A vs. Team B. But for what its worth I have compared my systems predictions of individual games with KenPoms in the past and I have been quite pleased. My system is MUCH more accurate later in the season as comparative statistics start to normalize. I would expect KenPoms prediction to be somewhat similar to mine right now and even more so further down the road. ,CollegeBasketball,cn1ucyh,2,t5_2rj3j

2636303,0,t1_cn29tzx,Its because they put so much effort into blocking shots  interior defense and defensive rebound are to some extent inversely correlated. Getting in position to block shots often takes one out of position to grab defensive rebounds. Think Kevin Love. The dude eats Drebs like nobodys business but his interior defense is nowhere to be found. And thats not even considering the fact that its far more unlikely that a team recovers a defensive rebound off a shot they just blocked than any other defensive rebound from a nonblocked shot. So Kentuckys NCAAleading blockspergame hurts their defensive rebounding a bit. Furthermore I think another thing that skews the statistic is the fact that it really is so difficult to get a shot off in the paint against UK. That difficulty  more long shots. More long shots  more long rebounds. More long rebounds  more  balls. More  balls means more offensive rebounds and less defensive rebounds. ,CollegeBasketball,cn2p4vv,1,t5_2rj3j

Besides I dont quite get the sense that were all that disrespected anymore  most of the CBB reading amp podcast listening I do these days does nothing but heap praise on Virginia when we are mentioned.  I also think the fact that we have established brandname teams in Duke amp Kentucky that look as good as they ever have and feature a slew of ultratalented ultrahyped pro prospects contributes heavily to the fact that they dominate most of the national conversation. Its not too surprising.  All we can do is take care of business now that conference play is starting.

We should have at least one of them scoring  points a game and instead they are both getting  combine that with hurt PGs results in us sucking. Dont even get me started on the front court also fuck you NCAA.I gave this team a chance even after NJIT Eastern Michigan and the curb stomping by Arizona but barely scoring over  points in the nd half while the game is still within reach is inexcusable. I thought this team would be good enough by the time conference play came around I was fucking wrong. There is no leadership no one is getting pissed off like Novak during Michigan State or Burke and the seniors after the Penn State game  years ago. If we had even an average offense then this team would be good but this offense is garbage I constantly feel like slamming my head into a wall because they are just so bad. This defense has been alright but it doesnt matter because the offense is so incompetent that they barely score  points a game against crappy teams.  All I hope for is for us to beat Michigan State and Ohio State once this year. Im going to start drinking now and watching Trey Burke make  foot s against Kansas.

Aside from the strangeness in the Kentucky game where they took a point off the board about five minutes after the fact after several natural stoppages there was a weird situation when the Terps beat MSU a couple weeks ago.  Maryland hit a gametying  with  seconds left in regulation.  MSU pushed the ball up and missed the potential gamewinner to send it into OT.  After regulation had run out the refs went and reviewed Dez Wells gametying  to see if his foot was on the line it wasnt but it was very very close.  But if his toe had been on the line they would have taken a point off the board and given the game to MSU  but obviously the Terps would have fouled on that last MSU possession instead of letting them throw up a desperation heave.  ,CollegeBasketball,cnkqjl4,7,t5_2rj3j

Normally I agree with you and maybe here Im not outright disagreeing about clock management but that wasnt an impressive coaching performance for me. Zero offensive discipline once we get up seven points or more. Then no D on the other end. That equals unnecessarily tight games and typically losses. Weve squeezed out two in a row but that shit isnt going to fly at Illinois or Purdue. ,CollegeBasketball,cnob4xt,1,t5_2rj3j

3000760,0,t1_co8wh7a,Our biggest strengths are size experience and depth.  Size Karnowski is a  lbs center that knows how to play.  I dont think there is a single center in the NCAA that can reliably guard him on.  Hes got a great jump hook that he hits at a very high  hes patient and he keeps the ball over his head.  Passes very well from the post.  His one offensive weakness is free throw  but hes getting better at that.  Defensively he dominates the paint.  Not the fastest guy but hes smart and wont take stupid fouls very often.  Wiltjer is an outsidein threat that will force your PFs to guard him on the perimeter.  Leave him open on the perimeter and hell sink a .  Guard him close and hell dribble pass you unless youre much more athletic.  He also has a good interior game of turn around jumpers and hooks.  Sabonis comes off the bench at either C or PF.  Hes a high energy rebounding machine.  Very efficient inside.  Not bad on defense and getting better.  Was prone to frustration earlier in the season but that seems to be dissipating.  Could start almost anywhere.  Experience We start three true seniors Pangos Bell Wesley a redshirt junior transfer with a national championship on his resume Wiltjer and a true junior Karnowski.  Off the bench we have another redshirt junior Dranginis a transfer junior McClellan a Freshman that played in the Spanish League as a teenager Sabonis and a senior transfer Nunez along with one freshman that plays Melson.  Pangos and Bell have been starting together for four years now and Dranginis has been with them for four years as well.  Depth We can legitimately play  deep now though Nunez is iffy.  So even if teams can keep up with us we can wear them down especially if theyre fouling our bigs.  ,CollegeBasketball,co90z0e,15,t5_2rj3j

On top of all that PSU football is top in alltime wins with several national championships and conference titles.Chambers meanwhile walked into a situation where our basketball budget was the lowest in the conference our stadium and facilities are the worst in the conference the year before Chambers arrived the team was famously kicked out of their practice facility for Bon Jovi rehearsals no recruiting connections or base and almost zero fan or alumni support. Before he coaches his first game the Sandusky scandal hits and the entire athletic department is thrown into chaos. PSU hadnt signed a four star recruit since at least  and we hadnt signed a player from Philadelphia in around the same timeframe. Our previous coach resigned to take the same job at Navy. In short PSU when Chambers arrived was the worst job in major college basketball. Its taken a huge amount of work just to get to where were at now  this year for the first time Chambers was able to get banners of our players hung in the arena concourse  and we just signed two fourstar recruits for the best recruiting class in the programs history. On top of that Chambers is working uphill to build a program from scratch in one of the best conferences in the game. Firing Chambers now strips away all that progress meager as it may seem and says loud and clear that success in mens basketball at PSU will not be tolerated.,CollegeBasketball,commxvv,5,t5_2rj3j

3138544,0,t1_con5tow,First off this standard of the most exciting team in college basketball is purely subjective. Secondly just because a team throws alleyoops and shoots threes that makes them the most entertaining? Do you ISU fans even watch games outside of Iowa State? Almost every team in the top  does something well thats what makes them a top  team. You know whats entertaining to most basketball fans? Winning. Winning conference titles conference tournaments regional championships and of course the national title. Yet somehow Iowa State fans recognize that throwing alleyoops and making three pointers is much more exciting than winning. I do understand that Hoiberg has turned your program around considering ISU hasnt seen this type of success since the early s. It sure is a different brand of basketball there. But just because your team is good does not mean that ISU is the most entertaining. I cant believe Im even arguing this purely biased opinion. Objectively Kentucky has to be the most entertaining team to watch. They mostly shoot the ball well throw down the sickest dunks and stop their opponents from scoring on a night in night out basis. They also havent lost a game this year. Other teams I find more entertaining than ISU are Duke UNC VIRGINIA even with their slow pace Utah Nova Zona BAYLOR. ,CollegeBasketball,conb205,-1,t5_2rj3j

Texas specifically excluded prostitution in its discussion of what kinds of sexual conduct were constitutionally protected.If such a thing were to happen and there was a lawsuit the government of whichever state would probably cite Lawrence and argue that rational basis review applies which essentially means that if the government can make any halfassed case why the law shouldnt be struck down then it stands as constitutionally valid. Theyd probably say something about public health.Itll be interesting to see if this is actually something that shakes out if and when prostitution becomes legal in more places than just rural Nevada.

Rather than just straight up appeal a law that made all sodomy consensual and not illegal they edited the law to make nonconsenting versions illegal.

I know that would be very difficult but I still think that that is valid.The other thing is that you go from using past performance measured by KenPom which takes into account every game and every score but then you show your data using a binomial approach so its either yes you did play well enough to win a final four game or no you didnt. Basically that makes it so that Arizona loss to Oregon State the same value as our  point win over Va Tech. I think it would be more accurate to show a value of a composite of how well a team does compared to how well they would need to play to win a sweet sixteen elite eight... etc. Does that make any sense?

I wouldnt expect the efficiencies to change drastically but yeah the total points scored and allowed will rise. Big whoop shits a meaningless number anyway.I dont believe it will force slower teams out of their comfort zone or lead to desperate offenses putting up bad shots. We are talking about five seconds here. If anything it will mean that teams who DELIBERATELY stretch out offensive possessions to waste less time getting their offensive play running.  seconds is more than enough time to run an offense.Things that will suck is that as possessions rise naturally there will be less upsets as the more efficient teams will have a better chance than before to win.On the other side this will DRASTICALLY reduce the amount of time it takes to close out a basketball game. The oh shit we need to foul strategy should take place at least  seconds earlier than it does now. This should also make close games more exciting at the end.,CollegeBasketball,cp2i9xs,1,t5_2rj3j

Quoting multiple pundits in the national media on that one including Jay Bilas as well as people who regurgitated that ridiculous idea in this sub. Oops more margin for error than ever before. Thanks for your concern though!However Im incredibly worried about Cliffs eligibility and what the NCAA might do. Nobody else here even cares apparently.

3349518,0,t1_cpa200w,Extra BenefitsDefinition Extra Benefit Bylaw ..  An extra benefit is any special arrangement by an institutional employee or a representative of the institutions athletic interests including fans to provide a studentathlete or the studentathletes relative or friend a benefit not expressly authorized by the NCAA legislation. Extra benefit regulations pertain to prospects as well.According to Bylaw .. receipt by a studentathlete of an award benefit or expense allowance not authorized by NCAA legislation renders the studentathlete ineligible to compete while representing the institution in the sport for which the improper award benefit or expense was received. If the studentathlete receives an extra benefit not authorized by NCAA legislation or an improper award or expense allowance in conjunction with competition that involves the use of overall athletic skill e.g. superstar competition the individual is ineligible for all sports. Exception for Benefits Available to Other Students Bylaw ..  The receipt of a benefit by a studentathlete or his or her friends that is not authorized by NCAA legislation is not a violation if it is demonstrated that the same general benefit is available to the institutions students their relatives and friends determined on a basis unrelated to athletics ability.SourceEDIT see also USCs compliance office SourceQ. Is it permissible for a studentathlete to receive preferential treatment benefits or services e.g. loans with deferred payback basis because of the athletes reputation or potential as a future professional athlete? A. No. Studentathletes are precluded from receiving preferential treatment based upon their athletics ability primarily because of the competitive disadvantage it could create for schools whose athletes do not have access to such services. Therefore the association prohibits this activity for all studentathletes. It is important to note that a studentathlete may borrow against other future earnings potential from an established accredited lending institution exclusively for the purpose of purchasing insurance with no cash surrender value against a disabling injury that would prevent the individual from pursuing his or her chosen career provided no third party is involved in arrangements for securing the loan. The studentathlete shall report such transaction to the university and shall file copies of the loan documents and insurance policy with the university.,CollegeBasketball,cpa2jb7,2,t5_2rj3j

3404342,0,t1_cpgazcx,Well thats the rub isnt it? Committee has to balance statistics vs actuals. Statistics say MD didnt blow out bad teams well enough so their efficiency rating is in the crapper. Those models punish Maryland for beating teams like Nebraska by  the same amount as they punish Oklahoma for losing to Washington.  Statistically those games were the same outcome as far as a computerpredictor cares. Actual outcome obviously wasnt treated the same at least in MDs case. Its like how people are so sick of hearing how SEC teams in football have good loses being better than close wins by other teams in weaker conferences. Ive always been in the camp that computer models should always be  to actual results. Thats why its so frustrating to see here and have nearly half the actual loses that teams ahead of you in the seeds have.Wining doesnt matter as much as how wellstatistically you play.

3436280,0,t1_cpjxy75,Listen if thats your opinion thats fine.  I dont think theyve released enough information to the public for us to definitively claim if it was cheating or not so Im not going to try.  That being said I feel like saying yes there were fake majors with fake classes and yes the entire team was taking one of these majors but they said that they didnt take any of the fake classes so its fine is kind of like burying your head in the sand.  And I swear Im not trying to start a fight with you but come on man.  I get that it sucks to have your team accused of cheating and Im sure you guys really are beat up about it.  But Illinois has never won a national championship and that was our best well maybe second best chance ever to win one.  So you move on after the loss only to later find out that there was a pretty good chance the other team was cheating.  That sucks a lot too.  So if you think UNC still deserves the title thats fine but personally I disagree.  It was still a good game and like I said I guess well just have to wait and see what the NCAA decides.,CollegeBasketball,cpjymfm,3,t5_2rj3j

We are an efficient offense albeit a far cry from preAndersons injury that had the second worst shooting performance of any team in the entire tournament.  Part of that is what Michigan State did and part of that is just horrible timing to not be able to hit shots and not getting seemingly any rim fortune.  The biggest thing you guys did was that you didnt allow us to be comfortable in the paint with six fantastic blocks turning into a few great transition layups in the beginning of the game so when our shots werent falling we didnt have a good alternative to be able to score.

3540537,0,t3_30twr7,College sports have never been about parity.  Even predicting  years from now its a pretty safe bet that at least one of Kentucky Duke Kansas UCLA and North Carolina will be in the final four and probably more than one.  This is in despite of the fact that nobody currently associated with those programs will still be there at that point in time.  I do have to admit recent UK teams have been on a crazy tournament run and they really have beaten the recruiting game past anything I can remember but it was probably the same during the Wooden years at UCLA.What concerns me more is the downhill trend in refereeing.  There are too many judgment calls that leave both sides feeling like the referees are terrible and they have too much power to control the tempo physicality and in too many cases the outcome of a game.  I really think we need to rework the rulebook and try and make some of the calls more objective and clearer for referees and players to understand.  ,CollegeBasketball,cpvudvf,1,t5_2rj3j

For better or worse this is what the system is in basketball and all sports besides hockey if Im not mistaken. We cant have refs agonizing over every close call checking slow motion of every angle to make sure no call gets missed down the stretch. The final minutes of a basketball game already slow down a lot that kind of officiating would bring the game to a grinding halt. No one want to see that even if they dont admit it right now.

However being in your tent for that line does not automatically put you in line for all the other games of the season. If you want to get in line for a different game you have to physically be on the sidewalk.Depending on the game X people can hold spots for Y students. So during tenting season a couple people would be in the tent holding that spot and then some one else in the tent would in line holding spots for the game of the day. E.g Im in a tenting group and I have to be in the tent from  on Saturday. Im holding the spot for all  other people in the tent. I want to go to the  o clock Saturday game so at some point on Friday or Saturday morning someone else from the tent gets in line for the Saturday game and holds both my spot and hishers.The best way to think of it is that every game of the season has a line for it. The one for Carolina starts the first day back for classes and thats what tenting is.

Their student section is always solid but the wider fanbase kind of loses interest in off years. Their CBB history really kind of started with Donovan too. Before him they had only been to the sweet sixteen twice and had only made the tournament  times.Sure backtoback titles made the school really hot for recruits. Plus theyve had continued success in the s aside from last year. Hell they beat us  times in  and we made it to the NC game. Donovan continued to get some pretty highly rated players too. But in terms of blue blood status and a coach that has had anywhere from  guys in the first round of the draft and  lottery picks every year at UK I could see that it would be hard for him to compete for the really elite players.,CollegeBasketball,cquyxhu,50,t5_2rj3j

Doctors get paid next to nothing as they make their rounds and do their schooling only to cash in big after theyve proven themselves.  You hear countless stories of people starting in the mailroom etc.  If there was no NCAA we would likely have something very similar to MLB where players get paid marginal salaries to make their way through the minors only to cash in AFTER theyve proven themselves in the big leagues for sometimes  or  years rookie contracts. I understand the big difference is THEY GET PAID but I guess the point of the discussion here is that these college players are getting paid in exposure rather than dollars.  Right or wrong aside I think that has a lot to do with why there is a general apathy for the plight of the one and done.  We all have to pay our dues.,CollegeBasketball,cr5fb4n,1,t5_2rj3j

4211760,0,t3_394hlg,I believe Indiana for multiple reasons Indiana has a VERY good team this year. I think their coach has vastly underperformed to his potential. I think that will turn around before long if hes given the chance.And that brings me to another point one that is based more on feelings than fact. But judging by the fans I have met Indiana takes basketball WAY more seriously than UCLA. I have met a guy whose grandfather father mother sisters and himself went to UCLA and he couldnt be bothered less with wether they won or loss. I have met several Indiana fans that never even went to the University that watch those games religiously critique every play and memorize all the players.Lets face it there is just more to do in LA than watch a college team. You wont draw in the casual fan nearly as much. If UCLA basketball faded into obscurity it wouldnt bother too many people at least it seems to me. If Indiana basketball gets any worse than it had been for the last couple years the whole state will be up in arms and changes WILL happen.Personally I believe Indiana is a sleeping giant much like Kentucky was during the latter Tubby Smith era until the Calipari era.,CollegeBasketball,cs0bse1,26,t5_2rj3j

4372691,0,t1_csiiarn,Well you are acting like your class is years ahead of everyone elses. I mean if you want to compare them position by position I would honestly take ours over yours. You obviously have the advantage over us in Forwards as Ingram is a top  player and Wynard is probably only a top  talent. Your next highest rated player is Jeter but Skal both centers is much better than him as Skal is a top  talent in the class. At PG you have Thornton but we have the best PG in the class so we have the advantage there too. We then have Murray who will be a top  talent who has the advantage over Kenard. Lastly you have Vrankovic who will ride the pine for you guys and may develop into someone in  years and we have a JUCO AllAmerican in Mulder and a top  player in Matthews. So in my opinion I dont see how anyone with clear eyes could not see UK has the better class. We have the advantage at every position except forward.

My strengths are more applicable to policy enforcement communication and regulationimplementation of core values. Reddit is inherently a forum based site dedicated to fostering civil discussion about a multitude of topics. Observing the game threads this past MarchApril I realized that as the traffic increases the quality of discourse decreases. This is not a problem unique to college basketball which means that a proper policy exists vigilant removal of low quality comments hiding points on GDTs friendly reminders. But for now the point is this. All fans deserved to be heard flair or no flair. The proper way to encourage and develop a strong community built on reasonable and lively CBB discussion is to promote and support the better contributors and the detailed commentors. I believe I can help this sub maintain and improve its discussion through timely clarification of rules as well as appropriate discretion when regarding decisions on unprecedented content. Im more than willing to support outreach to diversify guest appearances and AMAs  assistant coaches event managers more former players as well as attempting to generate more partnerships try to get the college basketball media to register accounts with the sub similar to rbaseballs work with MLB video amp the players union. I love to see passionate fans get every opportunity to express their opinions and this subreddit has proven that so far. But through increased outlets and a clear message of what we want CBB discussion to consist of rcollegebasketball has room to improve. I can help with that growth as moderator.

4943448,0,t1_cuhmdf0,A lot of that is personal preference though. Not everyone wants to live in a big city. They are loud polluted crowded and expensive LA moreso than most. Some people like the beach and mild weather other people would rather have seasons and miss the changing of the leaves in fall and the first snow of winter. And just because a city has less than  million people doesnt mean its a cow town.The recruiting base of SoCal is undoubtedly great but its also highly competitive. UCLA USC Cal San Diego State Stanford Arizona and Arizona St all recruit very heavily out of the LA area. And the kids there arent going to be bamboozled by the glamour and lights of the big city because they grew up with it and its old hat.UCLAs a great place to coach dont get me wrong but I think that fanbase and university support are both important.

The last several years Dukes defense has suffered because of individual offensive minded players who just turned off on defense Okafor Rivers Sulaimon etc. One weak link just destroys a defense. This year every player on the roster loves to play defense. Amile takes charges like a boss Obi is a bruiser Grayson and Jones bring that floor slapping attitude every time. The new recruits are all known for their defense as much or more than their offense and thats no accident on Coach Ks part.

All three are good shooters and I expect all three to shoot better next season. Shayok is a decent shooter  from  as well.Thompson was brought in to back up Perrantes yes but also to guard scoring PGs which has been the teams biggest weakness in my opinion. I love Perrantes but the only quibble I have with the preview above is that he is not a quick tenacious defender.

5241784,0,t3_3mrlqs,Yes amp No. College athletes come in two types those there for the collegiate athlete experience and those there to sustain their families. For the prototypical collegiate athlete I believe its okay to ask them aspire to being the best amateur they can be. And most of them will accept the naive belief that an education is enough. Except when its not when everyone else   the coaches athletic department administration and the dozens of other departments associated with a program  directly profits from the labor of gifted young athletes from difficult backgrounds. Nowhere else in our country are so many talented young men and women celebrated without opportunity for monetary compensation. Not just pay the NCAA effectively limits all opportunity for compensation. That shouldnt be okay in . As a former college athlete I saw some of my teammates families struggle financially while they suffered through major injuries or NCAA penalties never to earn a single dollar for their blood sweat and tears. Pell Grants are literally subsidizing the NCAAs most needy athletes. Whats worse some of my teammates even had to pay the NCAA through mandatory donations to charity for their crimes against amateurism.And to think we were all told that this was the way it was and always would be. Dont Bet On It they told us as they sold our likenesses to EA Sports ATampT and CBS...TLDR Its fine to not pay them in principle but the reality of completely restricting players opportunities is unethical. ,CollegeBasketball,cvhtpba,1,t5_2rj3j

5430077,0,t3_3pf0p5,Theres always going to be multitudes of reasons that contribute. I could write you an essay on the topic of why Maryland football underachieves despite one of the best recruiting areas in the nation. But heres a couple reasons...Basketball is a traditionally urban sport and Penn State is in the middle of nowhere. I would think this is a negative for many basketball players. PA has lots of strong programs that PSU has to compete with not to mention the larger programs that have a presence in the state. The AD simply does not give the program adequate money to compete in facilities or coaching.This might sound a little egotistical but I think Maryland joining the BG might be a huge benefit to Penn State basketball. I know for sure we want to raise our football program to compete with Penn State I think it will work the other way too. Chambers is definitely busting ass on the recruiting trail and trying to make connections with instate schools. Its paid off so far but they are a long way from getting where they can be. Fan support needs to get better and the team needs to start winning but I could see Penn State at least being a middling BG program given their brand location pride of the fanbase in general and money. They might never be on par with Maryland at least in the foreseeable future but it would be fun to see more competitive games even if we drop one here or there to get them excited.,CollegeBasketball,cw5qxpx,7,t5_2rj3j

5471775,0,t1_cwaxggj,Exactly.  At the end of the day part of the job of any leader whether it be CEO manager or basketball coach is to be aware and responsible for what happens under their watch.  It might even be different if this was a one off thing but for Rick to have zero knowledge of this happening for so many years is just clearly unacceptable.  I really think getting rid of Rick is the only way to start fresh.That said I still have mixed feelings about how responsible Rick was.  I think most coaches dont know nor do they want to know exactly what happens when recruits visit realizing that some unscrupulous activities are going to happen.  Rick is an incredibly meticulous individual and if he did know I do not think he wouldve put Andre McGee in charge of the operation or let it happen in the dorms.  It doesnt add up.  He probably did what most coaches do and turned a blind eye and in this case an assistant made some horrible decisions that got the whole program in trouble.  In the end however he still needs to take responsibility and probably be made an example of to let coaches know there need to be some rules in place so stuff like this doesnt happen.,CollegeBasketball,cwb2k4x,0,t5_2rj3j

So an AP voters ballot had a  weight for the AP poll but only has a  weight for this consensus while someone from a Top  with a much smaller pool of voters or someone who produced an individual Top  that got included would have a much larger influence.Or if you included the ESPN.com Power Rankings for example then someone like Dana ONeil gets her vote counted twice since she voted for both that and the AP.

What it means is that every player is entitled to their position and that extends to the ceiling. So in theory if a defensive player jumps straight up to try to block a shot and the offensive player crashes into him that should be an offensive foul its almost never called this way though. On the other side it refers to defenders putting their arms over the players theyre guarding. If that player jumps straight up into the defenders arms thats a defensive foul even though the offensive player initiated the contact because the defensive players arms are in the offensive players cylinder. ,CollegeBasketball,cx79rq5,3,t5_2rj3j

I dropped Duke a couple of spots but didnt go overboard because I dont think losing to the now  team and bouncing back against VCU and GTown warrants ending up th. I dont think Kansas losing to a Sparty team Im in love with on a neutral means theyre any less of a top  team than I previously believed. Some teams at the bottom got swapped out for others with more impressive single victories. It wont be that easy with me as the season goes on but early on we just dont have a lot of concrete evidence to go with. So Xavier winning at Michigan by ?

6088716,0,t1_cyhobnv,Louisville had a player break a leg and shoot bone out of his skin and they went on to win a national championship. Xavier is an experienced team that came in to the season with a well established identity. Dayton is a young team that lost its only senior and is still trying to find an identity. Entirely different situation with entirely different teams. There is no way you can predict how either team would react to these situations. My point is simply that the lack of both of these players on the court has a similar effect on both teams.

6100515,0,t1_cyj24xd,Yes but Jordans bulls are characterized largely by their rivalries. Jordan vs. Detroit was a storyline for some time in the mid s and made for great entertainment. Bad Boys vs Golden Boy. That is a large part of what propelled Jordan to superstardom on top of the chief propellant his own play. The first peat lacked a really formative storyline I agree. They played some great teams along the way but no consistent foe. Then in the second peat there was the rivalry with StocktonMalone in Utah which was the driving storyline. But think about it when you think about Jordan you really dont remember the first peat very much. I mean you remember that it happened but who they played and how it transpired is not an enduring part of Jordans legacy. Jordans legacy is losing to Detroit twice beating the Lakerspassing the torch completing the peat retirement comeback from retirement and beating the Jazz twice retiring again and then the Wizards stretch before final retirement. It is the rivalries that really make the league great and that people remember.,CollegeBasketball,cyj2en3,5,t5_2rj3j

Our only upperclassman Marc Loving is probably the instigator of the intensity problem. You can tell in the first five or so minutes if hes interested in a game and if hes not were probably gonna have a bad time. That said part of it was that our bigs got caught out of position on the pick and rolls and it allowed a couple of passes to take away our defensive shape to setup an open shot. You guys are a much better team and our lack of intensity shouldnt take away from the fact you had pretty solid ball movement and great shooting today.,CollegeBasketball,cz0mor4,13,t5_2rj3j

I get that losing to Marshall would be devastating for the Mountaineers football season and theres only a handful of nonconference games they can schedule each year.But thats not the case here.

There were many black only teams before them and many significant teams who were integrated before them too.

6401081,0,t3_43ay2g,Some ideas Set up a centralized standardized body reviewing officiating for adherence to the rules ingame consistency and betweengame consistency. Make assignment to conference tournaments as well as the NCAA tournament contingent on performing well. Standardize equipment everyone should play with the same basketball currently home teams choose and the NCAA tournament plays with a Wilson ball while most P schools use a Nike ball Get rid of the and. Missing the front end is basically a turnover as it stands. Why? Either switch to quarters with two shots after  fouls or in the single bonus the fouled team should be able to choose to inbound. Enforce the coaching box. If a coach is on the court in the same half as a live ball the first infraction is a warning and any that follow are oneshot technicals. Make looseball fouls that happen on the half of the court away from a teams basket result in an inbounds not freethrows. Losing possession of the ball is punishment enough. Shotrebounding scrumwalk  feet to shoot freethrows is not entertaining. In endofgame situations if an official determines that the foul was intentionalstrategic in nature they can count the first free throw as made and have the fouled player only shoot the second. This has the advantage of shortening the end of games even if current fouling strategy is pursued and changing the math on lategame strategic fouling. Note Im not  sure about the exact details for this one Add the clear path to the basket intentional foul that the NBA uses. Continue enforcing the freedom of movement rules. Even in conference play. Even if prominent coaches complain. Force the players and coaches to adjust. Allow for replay review of controversial calls by a dedicated official with an imposed hard time limit regardless of when they happen. Points are points and possession is possession even if its a few minutes into the first half. Having a dedicated replay official should cut down on the time spent in replay stoppages on officials waddling to the scorers table. After two years no penalty for the first transfer for students in good academic standing. Also no penalty for the first transfer if the head coach leaves. Cooperate with the NBA on a MLBlike system for draft eligibility. A promising HS prospect can enter the draft immediately but when he signs with a school he commits to stay there for two years. With the NBA set up a centralized system for giving players guidance about how many teams are interested in them and at what positions in the draft this level of cooperation is possible I believe its how selections are made for what players are invited to the Chicago workouts. Allow players to sign with agents but still be able to back out of declaring for the draft.,CollegeBasketball,czh8krv,3,t5_2rj3j

Complete and total embarrassment. They were up by  fucking points to a shitty Tennessee team and lost the damn game. Refs were fucking awful. UK played shitty defense but whenever they tried to play good defense they got called for a foul. And what kind of offense was that? Stand around and wait for Ulis to do something. DRIVE THE FUCKING BALL!Poythress is the only post player that gives a shit apparently but he disappeared thanks to foul trouble. Lee and Skal are completely useless for anything except fouling.

Its just not a textbook move by the ref and in critical game situations it can be costly if the refs arent on point. Im also sensitive to the issue as we were booted from the tournament in  based on this controversial call In our case Im not saying the call cant be made or is definitively wrong but given that the ref was fast on his count and Cory Joseph was calling for a timeout and based on the game situation as a ref it is a huge call that really influences the outcome. I feel like in those situations the refs cant make the call unless it is pretty obvious similar to the way fouls are called late game.

6492052,1,t3_44k5sc,I love losing all national respect in one game in one game to least liked team in the MVC.  Wait I mean hate.  Weve done nothing at all this year thanks partially to the worst MVC field in probably decades maybe in my lifetime and partially to injuries in the real season.  Gonna be so much fun when a team that should have been a top  seed goes into Selection Sunday with one RPI top win and    losses.We play good D but we just cannot consistently shoot the ball.  Already pissed away Rons draft stock Ron and Freds chance for any national awards our AP ranking twice and now one of our last strikes.  We arent out but we can only get a few more crappy losses and in the MVC losses only come in different flavors of manure.As far as Im concerned the regular season is over and we just need to drudge through the abyss of this crappy conference get through the MVC tournament and then conveniently forget this crappy crappy season ever happened.  Call it an unhappy accident and drop it on someones doorstop for all I care.  At least we probably get a chance to redeem ourselves if we dont shit our pants one or two more times.  ,CollegeBasketball,czqtrvm,-4,t5_2rj3j

6640177,0,t1_d06334n,My point is simple.  Its very hard to trust Nova when their only big OOC games they looked bad and they play in what is essentially a mid major conference these days.  They also dont have any guys that are first round draft picks which pretty much eliminates them as a title contender.  I could see them making a pretty deep run with the right matchups.  Hart is a hell of a player. Purdue is just a bad matchup because of the style they play.

For those who arent familiar with Marcus he is a senior GuardForward who has been the lifeblood of our team for these past  years.  He has climbed to the th spot on Techs alltime scoring list and with  points.  This is the highest total that weve had since Tony Atkins who was here from .  He showed promise even as a freshman as we saw him flash potential along with Robert Carter and fit well with our older players.As some of you might know Tech is not in a very good place as a program.  Riddled with recruiting difficulty transferring players and being overshadowed in one of the nations toughest conferences Tech has done well to even make it as far as we have this season.  We have the highest win total since .  We have a winning record. Weve won  of our last  games. Weve won  ACC conference games in a row for the first time since  in the ACCCT.  Marcus is a huge part of this turn around.  In those wins Marcus is averaging . Points . Rebounds . Assists in . minutes.  He is virtually the only reason we are in some of these close games and is almost carrying our team to victories.  And this Saturday is Techs senior night.  This is probably the last time that we will get to see the face of our program for the last  years play in Atlanta.  He stuck with us through thick and thin.  Carter transferred to Maryland.  Miller graduated.  Other guys were just transfers that we only got to see for a year or so.  Marcus has been GT basketball for me for the entire time Ive been a student.

I doubt well hear about any charges because the accuser probably just filed a complaint with Yale rather than going to police. The standard for expulsion is much lower and the penalty much lighter than the standard for a criminal conviction. Yale has a policy requiring affirmative consent meaning it has a lower threshold for what constitutes rape for its purposes. I dont think he should be vilified because I imagine that if we find out more about it there will be plenty of people who are sympathetic to him and plenty who are not but I dont think he necessarily deserves the benefit of the doubt either since Yale did decide to expel him. ,CollegeBasketball,d0o5kym,9,t5_2rj3j

The misconception is based on the racist culture that existed in Kentucky following the Civil War when the KKK had a large presence lynchings were not out of the ordinary and the Confederatesympathetic Democrats gained power. But that had nothing to do with why they chose the song they chose it in spite of its abolitionist message because of how it described the landscape of Kentucky. Funnily enough some of the more racist less educated people of the state didnt pay close enough attention to the lyrics and thought of it as their version of Maryland My Maryland and would sing along to it pridefully. This led to confusion about the songs meaning and the active decision to change the word darkies to people furthered that confusion.What exactly were you taught and where were you taught it?

As for Pitt and Cuse I could understand why they are ahead of us currently but considering we have resumes in the same ballpark and finished higher than them in the ACC we should at least be in the same category. Maybe its because people already counted us out before our  game win streak and we have just slipped under the radar.

6868751,0,t3_49txvr,This is coming from a college basketball fan that has had to suffer pulling for Auburn for the past  yearsThings arent going as well as I would have liked after two years but with the issues that took place this season I can let most of them pass. We have one of out best players sitting on the bench for eligibility issues out starting point guard and significant leader on and off the court has been out for most of the season with another shoulder injury and T.J. Dunans just came back in time for the last few games. I could go on an on about other excuses since theres been a lot of them.However Bruce has had to deal with a program that was in shambles. It was bad when Tony Barbee took over and in four years he just made it worse. Fans had almost completely abandoned basketball and only  players made it all  years at Auburn under Barbee including Jordon Granger who just graduated this year. This year sucked but its nice to look back on wins over UAB Kentucky and Alabama this season. If this team had avoided all injuries thats wishing for a lot I know and Danjel Purifoy had been cleared I honestly think this team could have pulled off  wins. That would have put us at the bubble or in the NIT which was my personal expectation this season. Instead due to all of the circumstances I think that just gets delayed to next year. Bruce is clearly recruiting well with a solid class that played this  year a good class coming in and already one of the top classes for . Im not worried at all for now and wont start worrying until at least the end of next season assuming nothing horribly goes wrong that is out of his or anyones control. I love Bruce as a coach and as a person and I honestly think that he enjoys Auburn. He wants to stick around but who knows how that will change if Auburn fans try to run off another good coach.TLDR Its been disappointing so far but excusable. The future is still really bright and results should start showing next season and really excel in following years. ,CollegeBasketball,d0uvtv4,4,t5_2rj3j

6868919,0,t1_d0uw4nh,I think Johnson and Brogdon are both better than Ulis. My personal top  is ZelBuddyBrogdonJohnsonPoeltl. Not only do I feel these are the  best players in the country this lineup also just makes way more sense from an actual basketball standpoint because you have everything  elite ballhandling shooting slashing rebounding interior defense shot blocking. The one thing you give up with Johnson gt Ulis is better perimeter defense and perimeter D doesnt matter as much as interior D anyway. edit actually if i were making a lineup for an actual game i would prolly substitute Perry Ellis in for either Johnson or Poeltl so i get dat sweet stretch  and average like  PPPagain not trying to disrespect Ulis but when youre talking about the  best players nitpicking like this is warranted. ,CollegeBasketball,d0uwik8,-1,t5_2rj3j

6925405,0,t1_d11b863,West Virginia doesnt scare me one bit honestly. I know Mack will be more than comfortable coaching against Huggins and I think we could draw a lot of fouls Against them. We can also throw fresh bodies at them a lot. I dont think anyone in the country wants to play unc with the upswing theyre on. They dont have an individual that I think would just murder us but they are so cohesive right now. Xaviers biggest advantage will be our  and its just hard to say how big of advantage that will be at this moment. Its a weird thing to play against and its really hard to figure out in the moment. I think itll be a bigger advantage in game two of weekends should we make it that far. I think X is a decent final four pick.

6926256,0,t1_d11eras,youre welcome. an important thing to remember is teams do not always shoot as well in the NCAA Tournament for a variety of reasons better defense abnormal sight lines and unfamiliar gymnasiums nerves new rims and nets more physical play with the refs allowing it etc.. The teams that can consistently get offensive putbacks are the teams that go on scoring runs in these games. The teams that prevent the opposition from getting offensive rebounds holding them to one shot per possession have a huge advantage. Again there will be some teams that advance that were beaten on the boards but as the number of teams drop from  to  to  to eight it is rare for one of these teams to continue to advance.OU doesnt have a big FG margin or rebound margin over their opponents. They also turn it over more than their opponents. These are not great qualities for a team who wants to make a deep run. If Buddys shots dont fall OU will be in trouble to create offense. ,CollegeBasketball,d11ezmf,2,t5_2rj3j

6930681,0,t1_d11lp1t,That argument had validity  years ago. WSU has proven to be a solid team for two rotations now. Also Ugly Valley basketball has been a thorn in KUs side over the years. Bradley UNI and WSU have wins over KU in the dance in  years. IIRC they have had two other close calls against the Valley including the National Championship year. But honestly that argument is a stretch. Yes I dont think KU should drop their Duke game to play WSU. But a couple of years ago they had a series with SDSU. That game should be against WSU. The win loss scenario is good for both teams and the fans would love it. The tie beaker should go to it just being good for the state. ,CollegeBasketball,d11x218,1,t5_2rj3j

I am pretty confident he can return to form heading back to his Philly roots but nothing is easy against Wisconsin. The increased minutes for Matt Farrell are frustrating.

Single elimination tournaments arent really great at determining which team is the best.Every team has a chance to lose every game.  Kenpom gave MTSU a  chance.

7006483,0,t1_d1aik1q,Not all the drives obviously. When you get a lane especially likely when lucasellis are out and youre up against Bragg or Traylor there will definitely be fouls either on a big reaching or the help being forced to come late. You can see that scenario happening especially if our guard reads the play wrong like in the KSU example or our bigs are too slow like in the WVU example albeit this was against our rd and th bigs But watch the play i specifically mentioned the UT gif in the article.  There is no lane there and when the authors only point is melo can beat bigs off the dribble well he wont be able to when the lanes are completely closed like that play and if he tries in THAT scenario it will be a strip or charge.Melo is elite at getting to the free throw line and absolutely concerns me but my point is the breakdown of our defense is done really poorly and the only example shown of our starting line up is pretty much textbook defense for how to defend Melo.,CollegeBasketball,d1aj2z0,9,t5_2rj3j

Pac  adding CU and Utah also were demographic moves. When CU made the move to the Pac  they were in the beginning of one of the worst stretches of CU football history.

7028744,0,t1_d1cuq6m,There we go. Now the rivalry is ignited. I knew there would be some fans dumb enough to not think that the game was botched and handed to them. Oregon did not deserve to win that game. Heres the video open your eyes when you watch it this time. Not only does Oregon touch the ball before it goes ten feet but they dont even ever have possession of it. I also a quote from a ref that day that proves this was the wrong call. On September   Riese served as the instant replay official of the University of OklahomaUniversity of Oregon football game in Eugene Oregon. During the final minutes of the game two plays were sent to his booth. The first was an onside kick by Oregon with a little over a minute remaining. The ruling on the field was that Oregon had recovered the onside kick but the play went to the booth for review for the purpose of evaluating whether Oregon had illegally touched the ball before it had traveled  yards. Those watching the game at home were given multiple angles of the play and many agreed with the broadcast commentators that Oregon had done so thereby giving possession to the University of Oklahoma.While Mr. Riese could not answer that question from the endzone angle he was able to determine that the University of Oregon did not actually recover the ball. Riese could see that Allen Patrick of Oklahoma had recovered it. Unfortunately that was not the purpose of the review and due to the restrictive nature of replay review rules Mr. Riese was limited to providing information regarding the original scope of the review.This ended up being a gamechanging call. After Oregon was awarded the ball they went on to score the touchdown winning by one point .Riese made several bad calls that day.Following this incident Riese was suspended along with the rest of the officiating crew for one game. After the incident he requested and was granted a leave of absence for the remainder of the season. He was later quoted as saying I feel so bad I missed that call its driving me crazy and that he was struggling with his mistake. Riese claimed to have received death threats and during an interview on September   he remarked that I cant sleep I cant eat my blood pressure is skyrocketing.Riese was considering retirement following the end of the season as recommended by his doctors. In February  the Pac Conference demoted Riese from replay official to technical assistant.From I hope this isnt too many words for you. Take your time. ,CollegeBasketball,d1d288p,0,t5_2rj3j

7040879,0,t1_d1eew0a,I did not actually. Duke was just as hot as UNC is now heading into that ACCT game but the big difference for me is that last years ND team was playing well headed into the postseason and pretty much all season where I feel this years team is limping right now and is a ways away from the stellar ball we played in that UNC Clem Louisville run we had in early February.I give them all the credit for finding ways to win against these pesky teams in the tournament but I cannot say weve played objectively all that well. Meanwhile UNC is absolutely rolling. One other big thing the statistic that has proven to be most influential in our WL results against Duke and UNC the past  years is rebounding which isnt that surprising given how basketball works. If we keep it near even we win and thats held true for every DukeUNC game. And when we dont keep it close we lose although also noteworthy was the huge TO difference in the UNC win this year.I am not all that confident with how Brice and Hicks are playing and with increased minutes for Matty Farrell that we are going to fare well in that department tomorrow. Really hope Brey is ready to ramp up Bonzies minutes.

7044554,0,t1_d1emcy4,First of all K obviously lied about it. No way around that I take issue with the lying. Earlier in the game Brooks said something to the Duke bench supposedly that K took exception with. That coupled with the ending  plus celebration added to the fact he just lost I think contributed to his lecturing of Brooks. I think that conversation was meant to be private and didnt expect Brooks telling the media that he told him that. I feel like thats why K said what he said. He wanted to keep it between them two and I believe he didnt want to make it an issue to the public and take away from their win. Hes always been a gracious loser and always compliments other teams and their coachesplayers. Bottom line He should not have lied whether he shouldve said that to Brooks or not is up to an individuals opinion. He has since apologized and theres nothing else to talk about it at least for me.  ,CollegeBasketball,d1euw5y,1,t5_2rj3j

7051024,0,t3_4c73tj,I think Roy is a great coach but it prone to criticism because hes the one who came in after Dean Smith retired. I think he tends to recruit and sign players that have the talent and will stay for  years. For some reason we dont get one and done but Im okay with that because then fans can cheer a team that they have known for years.Due to his recruiting strategy Tar Heels are legit title contenders every four years. I like the predictabilitycorrelation of that even though  didnt pan out that way because of Kendalls injury. Hopefully  will continue this strategy During the regular season I and many other fans were prone to criticizing the team but I dont think this is a bad thing. Healthy criticism is good. I didnt like the backlash after UNC lost the home game against Duke. Socalled fans eviscerated Roy for not using timeouts etc. Sometimes coaches have reasons for doing things a certain way but can also make mistakes.Coach Roy always comes off as a nice respecting person. Once during a press conference he accidentally swore and then he quickly apologized after saying he slipped up. The players all seem to love him. I love how he continues coaching hard even when were up by  points.I think he has a coaching contract until the  or . Not sure if hell retire then but if he does hell retire as one of the top basketball coaches and will be sorely missed.,CollegeBasketball,d1flbeq,7,t5_2rj3j

At this point its clear that  of third party observers are either too dim or too disinterested to note that there is no evidence that the mens basketball staff actually A knew the classes were bogus not just easy but bogus and B with that knowledge steered athletes to those classes for the purposes of keeping them eligible. Both of those have to be proven to logically assign culpability to the mens bball program and neither have.There is also a large portion of that  that may grudgingly acknowledge those facts but still think Roy must have known just because well thinking that is easy andor makes them feel good lack of evidence be damned. Unfortunately theres not much you can do when youre on the wrong side of that argument because most people just dont care until its someone on their side who is being convicted in the court of public opinion without evidence.

7173624,0,t3_4dhszt,Why is nobody complaining about the  year rule in college football but everybody seems to think whatever happens in college basketball is fine?I have  schools of thought. Players should be able to be drafted out of high school. If they choose to go to college there is a two year rule.. I think this would work best Adopt an NHLlike draft system. Teams draft players during their U year. The rights to those players are held by the NBA teams but the players dont sign a contract and are not professionals. Hence they can play college ball. When the player has sufficiently developed the NBA team can sign him. This adds to the excitement of the draft and allows for far more secondrounders and undrafted players to become studs in the NBA. There is no need for the players to test the waters of the NBA draft. ,CollegeBasketball,d1tknx6,1,t5_2rj3j

Even without the value of hindsight I dont think that season is better than this one.As to the  point its the hindsight thing again. We missed a lot of potential and in the end Odoms teams perennially underachieved. If you think the value of a season is totally independent of what happens before and after it then thats fine but I dont agree with that.

7248725,0,t3_4ep76u,What determines underachieved? Does someone in the conference have to win the title for the conference to be considered successful? Make the Final Four? Have multiple Sweet  teams? How important is tournament success to this?Id say that tournament success when evaluating conferences is somewhat disingenuous. Even in the best conferences have of the conference isnt getting into the tournament so a single elimination tournament already know for variability and wild outcomes is only going to include at best half of the conference and in many cases less than that.I also dont think that one teams success means much for a  or  team conference. When Kentucky wins a title does that make the SEC overall better? Not really. Is the Big East suddenly an incredible conference because one of its teams won the title this season? No that doesnt really elevate Marquette or Butler or prove their worth. It proves Villanovas worth not the entire Big East. Its a nice thing for a conference to tout I suppose but I think it gets way too much importance placed on it.I think the best measure for conference strength is how many teams it got into the NCAAT the NIT and both combined. Having a large amount of the conference in the NCAAT and NIT would indicate to me a lot of depth within the conference and thats really what were comparing right? A strong top is nice but I would think the strongest conference would be the best from top to bottom.Thats my rant on how people perceive conference strengths. With all of that in mind I would say that the SEC should be doing better. It has essentially been Kentucky Billy Donovan Nolan Richardson Bruce Pearl and Big Baby Davis for the last  or so years. There is plenty of talent in the South and these schools are in a P conference. I get that theyre mainly football schools but my God a P conference should not be getting so few teams into the postseason on a regular basis.Edit  Dont mean to do the classic oh my God thanks for the gold but I feel like I have to ask why I just got gold for this? Haha,CollegeBasketball,d224n4f,15,t5_2rj3j
7249146,0,t1_d2262xm,I think its relevant in this situation because with all of that money from football comes a lot of resources that canshould bring advantages. The point is that the rest of the SEC should be a lot better than it is because they have the resources to do it but they dont so they perennially underachieve.A similar argument can be made of individual programs. Take my own school for example. Think of all the local talent from DMV and Maryland that didnt go here. We probably should have been able to get some of them to come but we didnt and we traditionally havent gotten as many as we should. I would say that as a program over the course of history we have underachieved relative to where we really couldshould be based on the recruiting resources around us. Same argument could be made for Illinois DePaul and many other schools. At this point Maryland and Illinois arent blue bloods and probably never will be but there is all the talent in the world next door and both schools are squandering fantastic opportunities to get that talent. This example isnt so much for a lack of trying whereas I think SEC basketball has been weak because they havent cared but its just an example I came up with to help explain what Im trying to say.But yes in basketball P isnt a relevant term except I think it is when considering the resources an entire athletic department has to put into basketball. ,CollegeBasketball,d226d3x,1,t5_2rj3j

Last year we knew going in that we had a  star incoming freshman as well as a team that returned nearly everyone losing octeus but gaining Hill.  I knew with Hammons and Davis wed be beasts on defense but I figured Hammons would step up and take over games more than he actually did.  I think the biggest issue was guard play which should be better this year but now were losing a huge inside presence and that worries me.  We absolutely need to shoot the  ball better than we did last year.

If a top engineering school was pushing kids through who didnt really complete courses it could result in some dangerous situations. A scandle of that proportion may need that level of action.  the University higher ups should be atleast somewhat knowledgeable about what is being taught so there is either negligence or foul play at hand. It was clear there was some foul play regarding some athletes. But I dont think innocent students and departments who were doing everything right should be harmed as well. I think since this was an issue regarding athletes the NCAA should strike down on the sports associated. Not hurt all other students. Because for the most part taking away the accreditation will do very little if anything to punish the athletes and pretty much ruin s of thousands of innocent peoples academic efforts of the last few years.,CollegeBasketball,d4c5mpl,9,t5_2rj3j

For a lot of these grad transfer guys they probably see an opportunity to join a bigger program and either get some publicity for a possible overseas deal or make some noise in the landscape of college basketball. I think the reason were seeing more of them lately and at higher profile programs is in part due to the oneanddone rule with coaches having uncertain numbers of scholarships while on the recruiting trail. Having a  yearold player fill that scholarship that would otherwise go to a walkon can help balance things out a bit without sacrificing any long term recruiting plans. ,CollegeBasketball,d729ozs,5,t5_2rj3j

Definitely going to be a great race between the two. Yale loses Sears and Sherrod which hurts but Makai Mason is definitely an allIvy player and Dallier Downey and Phills all got good run in the tournament last year and should keep them a top  team for another year.    look a bit volatile to me Im not sure I trust Columbias returners enough to give them that th slot just yet.

Multiple players and all of Lonergans staff were interviewed on multiple occasions by an outside law firm Saul Ewing according to a source. In those interviews some players confirmed disparaging comments Lonergan made about other players on the team in addition to comments made about at least one opposing player.gtPer a source one of the questions asked to GW players was if Lonergan referred to former Seton Hall guard Derrick Gordon as the gay kid. Players confirmed that had happened. Gordon broke barriers in  by becoming the first active mens college basketball player to openly declare his homosexuality. George Washington played Seton Hall last season Gordons graduate year with SHU.gtThe outside investigation included interviews with multiple staffers in the athletic department as well. George Washingtons mens basketball team took a trip to Japan in August. After returning interviews continued. In the past three weeks the investigation uncovered new information allegations not included in the Posts story a source said.gtThings escalated quickly on Friday. One source told CBS Sports that Lonergan was escorted off campus. The staff was informed in the late afternoon that Lonergan would not be attending a Friday night dinner with a recruit who was on his official visit.

And I do dislike being in a conference so big that well only play teams in the other division once every several years in football. Once the Big and SEC expand to  both likely will well basically have two eightteam conferences. Which is kind of where we all were  years ago anyway. Smaller conferences are definitely more fun IMO. ,CollegeBasketball,d8wth8w,3,t5_2rj3j

Looming over me is Austin Nichols. His face is contorted in rage and he grumblesshouts How do you know me?I had never met him before in my life though I did know who he was. I dont really say anything until suddenly his face softens and he lowers me and drops me. Oh my god Im so sorryI stand there.Im sorry manI ask him if hes okay and he just looks dazed and confused. I ask him where his friends are. He says the Corner so I tell him Ill walk back with him. I wanted to make sure he was okay and no harm no foul. Were walking along and theres a police car. He sees it and says Thats a Chrysler I have a Chrysler we should take it are you down?I calm him down and we move on. He tells me if I never need tickets to just talk to him. We get to the Corner I go my way and he goes his.I wasnt surprised when he was suspended for the first game and Im not surprised now.I thought you were making a reference to how that took place on Wertland,CollegeBasketball,da8lmwr,2,t5_2rj3j

I know were working with a small sample size at this point but Illikainens advanced metrics arent bad at all so far this year. His true shooting percentage and effective field goal percentage are pretty meh but his player efficiency rating and win shares per  are better than both Showalter and Brown. His defense has actually been really solid so far this season as well as his ability to move the ball on offense without turning it over. His increased playing time isnt egregious considering that he hasnt been that bad and Brown has really been in a slump to start the year.

Its just insane to me that the committee doesnt weigh this properly that any loss to an unranked team is viewed as a bad loss. Its a huge reason why so many major teams refuse to do homeandhomes with midmajors because if they lose to a midmajor on the road even if its a potential midmajor conference favorite its viewed as a horrible loss that can cost them an entire seed line by itself potentially. ,CollegeBasketball,dak5gvj,2,t5_2rj3j

While its still not to the level of parity seen in mens bball if you remove uconn the last several years parity on the womens side overall has been increasing greatly.Personally I think SUs womens team is really fun to watch they play an exciting style. Its sad that they have one of the lowest attendance averages in all of D despite their success over the last few years.Plus its kinda nice knowing its not just a bunch of people gunning to be one and dones. ,CollegeBasketball,dawz6mw,10,t5_2rj3j

I dont think most teams have something to really worry about unless we play inspired like tonight. We dont really have any big guys except Jordy but hes a freshman and doesnt yet have the coordination.If you play big there will be little we can do defensively but we are oddly good at shot blocking.Our outside shooting has been suspect this year but we do have people who can shoot.

10240058,0,t3_5mn2kr,This team is honestly straight trash. We are not making any progress and we just solidified ourselfs as the worst team in the PAC this year. This goes BEYOND tres being out us being young and the loss of GPII.There are too many mistakes poor play bad decisions and they lack almost every basic fundamental there is to play at this level. We have NO fucking defense its disgusting. Im starting to think its a coaching issue and all of our success these last  years was solely based off GPII. I guess we will start to see over the progression of this year. Hes always put a huge emphasis on defense yet we have none and the last  seasons its was only GPII... something is going ot have to change if we keep playing like this. We had a great recruiting class this year and it was even better last year.. theres no excuse and he keeps blaming it on the same shit in his interviews.. THEN WHY HAVE THEY NOT CHANGED.the team needs to get tougher... that just says to me he does not know why we are doing bad and its sad because hes a fucking coach and should be able to pick apart why over these last poor games.I thing  conference wins is going ot be a stretch how fucking sad.... we let fucking UW put  points on us. There are no positives of this game and our only good player is a freshman. I honestly just hope that the fans still come out but i wont be surprised if we dont no one wants to watch us play and the team isnt giving us any reason to go out and watch them.

10362899,0,t1_dciomrj,Fair enough.  Were probably not going to agree here but from my perspective the XU player plants his right foot before hes hit and then settles into place going straight up.  His feet dont move from the time his right foot hits the ground with a couple of feet between him and the defender until Thomas initiates contact.  The bigger issue was the T which seemed pretty unreasonable in the context of the game but at the end of the day the refs didnt lose Xavier the game tunrovers and missed FTs did.,CollegeBasketball,dcip2el,-2,t5_2rj3j

For some reason the Zags tend to under perform as high seeds and as we saw last year they have the ability to over perform when seeded low. I looked it up before and if I remember correctly Gonzaga was bounced in what I call the second round in  out of  tourneys they were a  seed or higher. Those arent mind blowing upsets but it has to be extremely disappointing for a team to lose in the second round when they have F hopes.I also have to give props to you guys because while Butler has proven to be a force during March Madness we have never been seeded higher than .

Only time our players get better is when they put extreme overtime work. Gotts time with TJ and Cat was just a matter of them finally hitting their potential and the rest of the team being shit all together. So he made a system around them and it did decent.All Im saying is if Archie Miller can take a group of ragtag players from god only knows where to the Elite  a sweet  and first place in the A Id like to see him with some actual talent and raw skilled players coming in as freshmen. Also getting rid of Lutz proved Gott was crazy. He was the only Xs and Os guy we had and he got rid of him. And now it shows.

We definitely fall closer to the Big  crowd than SEC from my experience. Not a lot of button ups in Eugene on game day.Really our fan base is a weird mix alumni like me who are young professional guys and sorta jockishclean cut and look like we drove in from Portland Seattle in my case the old fans who have experienced all that suffering and stuck with it and then theres this combo of the redneckish types from the smaller surrounding towns as well as this sort of grungyhippiedrunk white trash set. There must be something worthwhile happening in the tailgating area because those guys always arrive five minutes into the game leave before half and then come back like midway through the third quarter.

The other thing I did misstate is that every point is not necessarily equal as a couple of years ago he tweaked to formula to minimize the impact of ridiculous blowouts but for the most part the difference between a one point win and a one point loss is substantially similar to the difference between a one point win and a three point win even though you and I would consider the one point win and one point loss to be radically different while agreeing that the one point win and three point win are substantially similar ,CollegeBasketball,dd3m2de,12,t5_2rj3j

10592196,0,t3_5rkdl5,gtWisconsin is shooting it terribly from  allowing a very high PT shoots terrible from the line and allows the highest FT in the conference. What makes Wisconsin good is their interior play very good PT and one of the best PT defense in the conference and they crush opponents in turnovers and rebounding margin.Two of the bad things you list for Wisconsin have nothing to do with Wisconsin.  FT allowed is completely independent from the team.  You cant play defense and every foul shot is of equal difficulty.  Similarly PT allowed is far more dependent on who you play than how you play.  Vast majority of  pointers are of equal difficulty.  There is no difference like  point shots layup v.  footer.  Good PT defense doesnt result in lower percentage shots being taken it results in fewer shots being attempted see Wisconsins  point shooting rate chart.  This is supported by the PT defense of Wisconsin you praise.  They dont give up offensively efficient shots layups or s forcing people to shot more mediocre  pointers  the ideal defensive shot.  ,CollegeBasketball,dd8i4k2,4,t5_2rj3j

Obviously they are much more frustrating to be a fan of than Alabama football but Alabama at least has a good enough program to make the post season most years with an occasional NCAA tournament birth. If they are good there is support on campus. In  when we didnt lose a home game every game was sold out and the student section was super full. Also the same for  when we had a pretty decent year and made the tournament. If they arent good then noncon is usually pretty dead and it picks up for conference games.

10791664,0,t1_ddt226v,Crean has  Sweet Sixteens in five years. He won the BG regular season twice I think? Correct me if Im wrong. And while he isnt one of those coaches who can do a lot with a little I think he does a good job of coaching defense. Plus he did a good job at Marquette better than hes done at IU it can be argued. Plus he does a better job at recruiting than Gott. DSJ was States first high profile recruit in a looooong time and with this season going the way it has itll be a long time before a Gottled team gets another star recruit. On the flip side Crean has had Cody Zeller Thomas Bryant Yogi Ferrell Blackmon etc. Meanwhile Gott is an absolute trainwreck. Im not sure Ive ever seen someone who can so completely squander talent as he can. NC State has the raw talent to put together a tournament season but their play is so listless lackadaisical inept and pretty much any other negative adjective I can think of. I cant tell you how many of their possessions tonight consisted of Smith dribbling the ball for  seconds before hoisting up a terrible shot or passing it to Maverick Rowan and then he hoists up a terrible shot.Granted I dont get to watch IU very often because of where I live  I just see your scores and read recaps. But you probably dont get to see NC State very often either unless youre a Hoosier living in the southeast. Feel free to correct me on anything I might notve been accurate on ,CollegeBasketball,ddt3156,3,t5_2rj3j
10793498,0,t3_5ucvtw,I hate IU obviously but theyve had such shitty luck with injuries this year to the point where I cant blame Crean except maybe to a very small extent. I do hope Crean is there for a while because hes not a good coach has beaten Cal twice though including last year so Ill give him credit for that but Im not just defending him as a joke like I usually do.

Came off of  straight NCAA tourney trips and lost Lacey and Turner so a bad season isnt great but it is at least forgivable.This year however is set to be the worst season in over  years.  It isnt just that weve lost it is that weve been embarrassed.  Giving up historic defeats multiple times in a season isnt a good look.  This season is even worse when you consider we had a great recruiting class coming in.  Sidney Lowe didnt even have backtoback seasons this bad. ,CollegeBasketball,ddu7m00,3,t5_2rj3j

11049556,0,t1_dejtazs,Anyone who dismisses WSU in any game this year is very likely in for a rude surprise. Shaq is showing Carl Hall type moves and rebounding and has better backup than Carl did inside. Weve got  great guards and a few good ones. One of whom is actually better than Fred or Ron were in their freshman season. No offense at all intended towards them. Ron had an injury and Fred wasnt super great as a Freshman. They didnt come back or level up until the very end of the season. Two other people are playing exceptional defense in a position to guard anything but a center. All thats missing from the template of that year is quite the come out poised and ready to play but as I recall that started more in the tournament than in the valley that year. ,CollegeBasketball,dekg556,1,t5_2rj3j

With her going to school and me trying to keep a roof over our heads we were going through really tough times financially. When I saw there would be games in Philadelphia it pained me that it was so close and yet seemingly impossible with our financial situation.The day of the game she texted me after class.Hey were going to the games tonight.???!!!Theres some website called Stubhub. Tickets are only .Thats cool but I cant really afford it.I got my return for school I already bought them. Were going.It was one of countless times that she did something amazing just for me and I was blown away. I was going to two NCAA Tournament games. The drive there I felt like a kid waiting for Christmas morning to arrive. I knew Florida Gulf Coast couldnt win but I hoped that it would at least be close. Who knows? Maybe I could witness some March Magic.....I still have those tickets and it was a night I will never forget.

I was much more disappointed with our Little Rock loss up by  points on a  seed under min to go and losing. We struggled the first half but dominated  min of the second half. It was embarrassing.

Its not my argument as to why hes the best player in the league but it only adds to the effect.Theres a very strong argument for Monk over Thornwell.  Thats why he was voted AP Player of the Year and is being selected as an AllAmerican.  Hes an AllAmerican in the eyes of the entire country but your argument is hes not good enough to be SEC Player of the Year? Because subjectively Thornwell just means more? Thats absurd.

11136746,0,t1_deubpai,Illinois State and Syracuse are th and st in KenPom.  And if you are going by notable KenPom wins you have to take into account location or else you give a massive bias to the team that has a ton of chances at home.KenPom does that on the subscriber pages by dividing games into Atier and Btier games which essentially are the games equivalent to a top  or  team at a neutral site.Syracuse is  in B games and  in A games.  Illinois St is  in B games and  in A games and has  additional bad loss.Frankly I dont think either team should be in but not because of wins against the top arbitrary or schedule.  Illinois State shouldnt be in because they have played bad since January th beating bad MVC teams by close margins and getting shellacked by Wichita.  The quality of play isnt high enough.Syracuse shouldnt get in for the same reason.  They havent played good enough especially away from home.  They should be winning  of their B games and  of their A games to have a good argument against the field.I just dont think schedule should be used as the criterion because it is one of the criteria along with Top Arbitrary wins that creates needless bias to power conference teams.  ,CollegeBasketball,deuc7se,6,t5_2rj3j

If they won half the time it would average out to be around K per school per year. Thats about the same as an extra guarantee game on the schedule. Im not sure thats worth it.

11170795,0,t3_5zc41u,Its one tournament you guys. One. MSG next season will make two. Its a way to show Maryland and Rutgers hey we welcome you as new members and were going to show you some love. The tournament is already going back to Indy and Chicago after .Now I would totally understand why this would really upset people if the tournament was held in DCNYC in an equal rotation with Chicago and Indy or if it was even semi regularly held there. But I would guess itll be on the east coast once or twice every  years. Really think you guys will be alright having the conference show some appreciation for the new members. Its not a slap in the face of the longtime members. Its not an insult. It doesnt mean they dont care about you anymore or care about Maryland and Rutgers more. It just means they care about us at all which is nice.I will say its very weird to have the tournament a year early next year to have it in MSG but MSG is also a super cool place and the Mecca of College Basketball. I get what the conference is trying to do and I think its a great idea and great gesture. Its unfortunate how it has to work out in order to host it in NYC but if it happens this once or very very rarely in the future I dont have any issues.Also thisgt Jim Delany does not expect standingroomonly crowds this week at Verizon Center. What the Big Ten commissioner does expect is to underline a message sent three years ago when he spearheaded the conferences additions of Maryland Rutgers and the major MidAtlantic television markets that came with them.gt The Big Ten is not just visiting Delany said in an interview last week returning to a phrase he has repeated at times since expansion. Were going to be living here.He knew the attendance wasnt going to be great. This was never about attendance. This was about sending a message to Maryland and next year to Rutgers that the conference cares about us and considers us equal members to everyone else. Its a gesture not a scheme.No shit there arent as many Big Ten fans in the DC area. Delany knows that. He wasnt banking on tons of people turning out. He was just trying to extend an olive branch to Maryland and Id say it worked pretty well. I imagine next years tournament in NYC will get a similar reception from Rutgers. Since that was the entire goal I would say its the opposite of a big whiff its a rousing success.,CollegeBasketball,dey74kk,3,t5_2rj3j

They have a top  strength of schedule on Kenpom and the  overall and out of conference strength of schedule in the nation in RPI which is still the top index used by the selection committee. That is the big one. And speaking of RPI their RPI away from home is in the top . While that isnt amazing this is another thing that the committee has clearly been looking at as there are numerous teams who have been clearly docked for only having any significant wins at home.Speaking of Kenpom they are ranked th in overall efficiency margin so its somewhat suspect that you use individuals to make them look worse while ignoring this. It doesnt make an argument look good and if you were not attempting to argue against them then it still doesnt make sense that you would purposefully not take this into consideration.The biggest why if none of this is acceptable enough can come if they beat the  seed theyre up against.

Roy knows how to relate to players of this generation will recruit well and is the only coach of the ones that are being rumored that I think can potentially bring a spark to the program.Also he will be cheap. They could take the money that they will save rumor is my for coaches that they are looking at and spread it out and hire a kick ass staff to go along with him. I think a good number of quality assistants would jump at the chance because they would have more responsibility than they would on other staffs and at a higher salary. This would lead to them potentially getting to head coaching jobs faster.If after  years things arent looking up move on. Having one coach for  years outside of the blue blood programs and Gonzaga is very rare these days shaking things up with a guy that already loves UW isnt THAT bad of an idea.,CollegeBasketball,dezperk,6,t5_2rj3j

11192166,0,t1_df0jrum,Im not at all new to college basketball.  You may be if you think Virginia is the worst ACC program of the last  years.  That goes back to  which would include two Elite s two Sweet Sixteens  NCAA appearances and  NIT appearances  Championship.  Underachieving for Virginia due to two bad hires in Gillen and Leitao.  Poorly managed but not worst and in any case that shows the program has a high upside and was lying dormant based on poor hires.  You also dont know what happened with Wisconsin and I dont see why different cycles is important.  Wont deny the timing worked out for UVa.  If you include States nattys from  and  they robbed  from Virginia as well as Houston ironically they gain some clout and their way way ancient history with Sloan was something but outside of that it is entirely plausible for a coach to choose Virginia over NC St for any number of reasons.  Or ND.  Or even Syracuse or Louisville depending on what he values.  Syracuse has never been good without their current coach and Duke wasnt special so I dont really get your point there either.  Bennett will never post Ks numbers but he could equal or better Boeheim in a lot of metrics. Dont be bitter because Turgeon cant coach up to his recruiting  and too bad about having to leave the ACC.  Had to fix the finances though speaking of horrible management so it makes enough sense.  Again maybe stick to chanting fuck at people wearing hideous uniforms Maryland is very fortunate to have the UA relationship and breaking down Nebraska. ,CollegeBasketball,df0mag8,1,t5_2rj3j

This year the defense is OK but exploitable. When FSU made the Sweet  in  and won the ACC in  our defense was arguably the best in the country and our offense was really tough to watch.

They ride in on a white horse to discredit anything negative said about the team while throwing everyone else including a womens basketball player under the bus. Im also appalled that Jackson wasnt suspended for damaging her car. That is very troubling behavior. Someone did something you didnt like so your solution is to go beat in their car? Who does that?? I understand hes young but even in a young person thats disturbing.The rest of the stuff is mostly ticky tacky but speaks to the poor decision making this group collectively has.

LSU has a much higher ceiling. gtThen again Shaka turned down UCLA to stay at VCU. Sometimes its hard to tell what these coaches are thinking. that has something to do with this.

He has plenty of things to work on. Not making boneheaded plays should be item  on his list. Graham... he is a tossup for me. I havent seen him on any draft prediction sites. With Frank leaving after this season his exposure is going to sky rocket. He will be THE leader of the team next year if he stays. He has all the makings of Frank but with the few extra inches in the height statistic. I know that older players dont do as well in the NBA draft but thats the nature of being a less touted recruit.

Although kind of hard to deny Jesus as a prophet just a matter of how divine he is some might say none others believe fully. Similar to Mohammed. Definitely a prophet but has more meaning to those of the Muslim faith. The Jews for Jesus I just find amusing because both Christians and Jews believe in the Old Testament however Christians incorporate the New Testament. So if youre calling yourself a Jew for Jesus wouldnt that just make you Christian?  Im sure theres more to it than that but thats just my gut reaction to it. ,CollegeBasketball,dfbmc3g,2,t5_2rj3j

The Giants winning doesnt mean the NFC was the better conference or the NFC East is the best division.It means the Giants as in the individual football team are the champs. They made it through the tournament they won the Super Bowl they killed the ultimate Goliath Helmet Catch etc.I mean Im sorry for the insult. But this is insultingly stupid.,CollegeBasketball,dfdval8,1,t5_2rj3j
11309320,0,t1_dfdv9l1,I dont get it. The winner is the champion. No one is contesting that. That doesnt mean the winner was the best team that season and having teams advance farther doesnt mean one conference is better than another. On one hand we have some  games and on the other we have a single elimination tournament. The best team doesnt always win all the time in either case but the tournament is a much smaller sample size. The goal of a single elimination tournament is not to get the best teams. The NBA has a  game series differences tend to show up more over a larger number of games. The Lakers would beat the Warriors once but the better talent would win a series. Sports isnt as simple as when it matters most. Par of it is luck having a bad day etc. Youre also using hindsight here. When people say the teams in a conference struggled theyre working with how they performed during the season. You cant use later results and act like that stuff was obviously wrong. ,CollegeBasketball,dfdw7cu,1,t5_2rj3j

The expectations were very high and meeting them is a really big deal. I think Illinois exceeded expectation with the Underwood hire. Their AD did a brilliant job of locating a successful coach in a big conference who was unhappy in his current situation. They made a competitive offer and landed a terrific coach.In short I think IUs hire met really high expectations while I think Illinois exceeded slightly lower ones. FWIW I am beyond thrilled with Archie Miller and theres nobody else I would trade him for at the moment. UI and IU both got significant upgrades and these hires benefit the BG in general. Replacing Groce and Crean with Underwood and Miller will go along way in changing the level of competition in the conference.Im looking forward to IU and UI finally both being good and wellcoached at the same time because there should be some epic matchups in the future!,CollegeBasketball,dfhcwfm,41,t5_2rj3j

11364569,0,t1_dfk3rwz,I read a comment yesterday that had a partial summation of what I think is going on. Kentucky is a state where a lot of people dont have things going right for them. Their high school and college graduation rates are among the worst in the country.source The poverty rate is also among the worst in the country.source With that in mind its safe to say decent amount of the population doesnt have a lot going right for them. Theres not a lot of success or winning per se. So when they see something that is successful that they can latch onto  in this case their states flagship universitybasketball program they latch onto it very hard. And when the one thing they have going right for them fails they take it very very poorly. Which leads to shit like what is happening.  This is why at least in my experience the better Kentucky fans you meet are usually alumni and the worst types are usually ones that have no form of higher education at all.  Im not trying to say this is the case for every person that doesnt go to college or that having a degree is an indicator for success but theres definitely a connectioncorrelation in my mind.,CollegeBasketball,dfk5ht0,131,t5_2rj3j

This is the stated policy but Im not convinced they dont bend the rules around the margins to get preferred athletes. gtAdditionally they use the more thorough CSS rather than the simple FASFA when they evaluate need which prevents families from hiding assets in businesses or anywhere else which can be done with the FASFA.I doubt this is an issue for a lot of families and the increase in difficulty getting aid is more than offset by the advantage of the amount of aid theyre able to offer.gtAdditionally the Ivy schools have to contend with the AI which drastically reduces their pool of prospective athletes.I dont know exactly how drastic but yes agreed.gtThe athletes are more often than not paying for their education.Id agree that the athletes are more often paying something for their education that athletes at athletically comparable schools but few are paying the majority and I doubt its enough to hurt recruiting The Ivies can still offer a great value proposition and paying the price of a car for an Ivy even if you have to take out loans vs. going to a Patriot League school for free is a no brainer.

Its another year of film and stats for NBA guys to analyze. For ex despite shooting . from pt some people are still skeptical of his shot. Lets say his numbers all across the board increase but his pt dips to around  then his stock is definitely taking a hit from starting out top . Its not uncommon to see questionable freshmen shooters to have a big dip in pt . Stanley Johnson was a  pt shooter. st year in the NBA he was only at .

In order to actually make this argument youd need to a prove that Cleaves wouldve picked Michigan if it werent for the sanctionsb prove that Izzo wouldnt have pulled in any other great recruits over the next several years that team wasnt just Cleaves Izzo recruited Peterson Granger Bell and Hutson around that same time and its not like Cleaves was the sole reason they all committedc prove that Izzo wouldve never gotten lucky with another recruit or stumbled upon a Cleaveslike player who he wouldve molded in a similar fashion  I mean Cleaves wasnt some onceinageneration talent and Izzo has done some pretty phenomenal things with guards over his career so its entirely plausible that he would recruit another solid guard prospect that would develop into the type of player who could lead a pretty loaded supporting cast to a national title.We hear enough of this were good because Michigan was down garbage in rcfb I never imagined Id hear it here too. Izzos success was not a fluke he replicated it over and over and over. He made a Final Four and fielded multiple elite teams after Michigan got good again and in the process coached up underrecruited players like Denzel and Travis  proving that perhaps he couldve recruited another Cleaveslike player at some point and developed them. Your scenario is so narrow that I could just as easily counter with what if Lucas didnt get injured in ? What if Zach Randolph played more minutes in ? What if Appling hadnt injured his wrist?  like dude come on.

11756482,0,t1_dgs8nif,AB should have never been a first overall pick.  If you followed that draft you would know that leading up to it the dude was projected to go in the  range in a really weak draft.  The fact he went first overall was a complete and utter shock and everyone knew his chances of living up to that pick was really slim.  He is not someone you would want to look to model your college career and draft stock from especially because the draft is not going to be weak next year.  ,CollegeBasketball,dgsmkte,1,t5_2rj3j

Theres absolutely no way that the author can know this without hearing directly from Self or his staff.

11796447,0,t3_689d7u,The  tournament.Yes Michigan State won it all in  so that should be my answer but for me its .Why ?  First off MSU made the Final Four despite losing their starting PG Kalin Lucas to an achilles tear during the game against Marylandwon with an great buzzerbeating  that caused the entire dorm where I was living to go from silent to exuberant in an instant.  Then there was the Northern IowaKansas game with an absurd  at the end that took Kansas out of the way followed by an Elite Eight win over a pretty decent Tennessee squad.  Was the loss to Butler in the Final Four disappointing? Yeah but the whole tournament was great for me as a fan.,CollegeBasketball,dgx61ex,3,t5_2rj3j
