2542728,0,t3_2otul4,What you saw is how drama is. History isnt full of envoys and honourable battles conflicts are not a pretty thing in general  thats what makes them conflicts. You can delete the whole subreddit if you want nothing will stop people from making their own. Your ideal envisioned ways of dealing with conflict are only necessary in the real world because of the scale  when two nations both have less than  people things like envoys are just role playing and there are other servers for that. This is a civilizaton experiment and that means it comes with the good and the bad that human nature has to offer. How to solve your problem with CoolPvP culture As a civcraft veteran I wouldnt call it anywhere even remotely close to that depends on what exactly you mean by it and what precisely you want to fix. I dont see why youre upset about people whining on the subreddit  debating justifications motives and political legitimacy are the root of what it is that gives any conflict political depth. But forcing people to not talk about it here? Theyll just go on teamspeak and talk amongst themselves all that will do is ruin the subreddit to be about nothing more than music monday posts.Also that first point is just a poor idea. I guess if someone were to pearl me they could keep me pearled indefinitely simply by not logging on since theyd ban whomever tries to break the vault.

3151699,0,t3_2w8zf3,While the intent behind laws of war is all well and good I doubt theyd actually be practical in the game similar to how the united nations ideas fail. War is pretty chaotic and often the reasons behind are less than black and white so its pretty hard to place any sort of controls over it. This issue is a bigger problem in the game since warfare is so heavily influenced by cool pvp behavior. Last night was a prime example when we saw the server have to increase its player capacity to accommodate all the extra fighters being brought in which I thought was against the rules but thats another issue. Problematically these people are here for the combat and not much else. So its really unlikely theyd follow rules of war and quite possibly even ignore the command of the people who brought them in the first place. ,CivilizatonExperiment,cooo63r,7,t5_33woh

Rule  we can simply change that to an embassy is strongly suggested and should be built if possible for good practice.

Many religious traditions such as Hinduism Buddhism and Jainism advocate restraint with respect to actions of body speech and mind. These religions teach that a deeper level of satisfaction and fulfillment is to be found than that offered by sensual pleasures and therefore promote the value of abstaining from these common ordinary pleasures in the pursuit of acquiring deep inner peace. The founders and earliest practitioners of these religions eschewed worldly pleasures and led an abstinent lifestyle not as a rejection of the enjoyment of life or because the practices themselves are virtuous but as an aid in the pursuit of such inner peace.gtgtImage i  A Holy man in meditationRelevant Asceticism in Judaism | Mendicant | Monastic cell | Choir monk Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcsuji oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecsuji.

6177482,0,t1_cyrepd2,Thats definitely not the way to do it. It sounds like it would work but in actuality you still end up with people in the best armor theyre just a little more annoyed with the slowness. They wont walk around in it but theyll bring it to fights or dangerous areas.The key to fixing the combat system is just divergence and specialization. As of now you have one option prot up. Thats shitty. Look at every other game ever and youll see slow strong characters magic stealth whatever and they all come with their own set of proscons that balance out the system.I literally have no idea how to properly balance minecraft pvp though. HCF had a decent idea with the RogueDiamondArcher setup but the meta was too focused on protpot pvp so the other two setups were deemed novelty outliers. Perhaps we could introduce something like that on here WITHIN REASON. The stuff we have right now is okay and for  of people who dont know how to PvP effectively its okay. On probably  of minecraft servers and this one you will totally be fine completely sucking at PvP in the current system because everyone else does. Very occasionally youll run into someone who is nuts that will annihilate you but if you dont like PvP and dont see the need to get good at it the ROI is eh.

6428370,0,t3_43qljd,I agree... Tentatively.I think that conflict is needed to fuel progress. Thats evident in history not even going to consider a counter to that. However players on the server tend to get... personally attached to their stuff with good reason mind you.I think that dedication is a little extreme at this point and if bastions were added it would need to be reduced to compensate. I dont think it could make raiding worse if it is a defensive system.Separately I think that there should be some sort of blood moon event every... whenever. Each player has a few random mobs spawn around them that are aggroed onto them. Large groups of people are attacked by an army small groups by a large attack group individuals by a small attack group. Maybe they could be withers even and thats how you get the wither to spawn? ,CivilizatonExperiment,czk8c8f,1,t5_33woh
