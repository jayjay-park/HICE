9936684,0,t1_db2h5ts,spoilers How little it focuses on the victims other than Angie and Rabbithis mother adds a real coldness to it. Since it didnt show too much of what actually happens in that room it leaves you to guess which is probably more scary than what could be displayed on a screen easily.,HorrorReviewed,db2rx4i,1,t5_3hso6

10616461,0,t3_5rxviq,Seems like some of these runner ups dont really have any business being near a top  list. I felt pretty much the same for the Phantasm movie I just reviewed the other night. Also looking at the posters for this one... There is more than a few but they are all pretty lame. Lame movie lame posters... I think well skip it in the poster rotation unless you REALLY want to see that one there ,HorrorReviewed,ddb0aaa,1,t5_3hso6
10961476,0,t1_deaeo0x,Yeah it is a really obnoxious thing to do.  You can sort of try to justify it in this movie as maybe the girl putting the footage together added the sound to it but that seems like a huge stretch too since they talk about it like theyre just dumping footage on a website.  ,HorrorReviewed,dealkbs,1,t5_3hso6

11691980,0,t3_66a922,Additional ReviewIm a big fan of anthology movies because they allow for a variety of stories and styles to be put on display.  The nature of the short film also offers up a certain amount of freedom as the concepts can be pretty creative and dont require a lot of exposition or character development.  Unfortunately in the case of The Dark Tapes the opportunity to take advantage of this simplicity is missed with excessive and cumbersome dialogue and explanation.Like other anthology reviews Ill break it down by individual segment and offer my thoughts on them.  Starting withTo Catch a Demon the wraparound segment started off very promising.  The science behind the concept was maybe a little iffy but the idea was solid enough to catch my interest and the first few exposures of the demon were actually really cool looking.  While the special effects were obviously budget limited I still found them sufficiently creepy in controlled doses.  The acting was fine certainly better than some of the other segments but as more of the story was revealed I was rather let down.  The science gets more and more head scratching as the characters talk about it and the longer the demon is exposed to the camera the more difficult it was to take it seriously.  The costume starts to look campy and the threat is minimized watching the creature dance around in a corner menacing the actors.  The voice modulation was also unfortunately cheesy and shows up in another segment later.  While I want to say that I enjoyed the segment by the end Itd simply lost most of its oomph.  Instead of being a wraparound I think it shouldve been a standalone segment and had a portion of its latter half cut out.  The Hunters and the Hunted was actually a lot of fun.  The haunted house concept seemed very generic at first calling back to films like Paranormal Activity and raised a lot of questions of why the people were staying in the house at all.  Of course I dont want to spoil it but suffice to say that this question is explained away with a fun twist that made the whole thing feel fresh.  Its the kind of story that is perfect for a low budget as there is little to no need for special effects.  The scares are purely atmospheric and implied threats and I was especially pleased at the total lack of jump scares despite how easily they fit into this sort of film.  The acting isnt amazing but never felt bad either I was always adequately convinced of the events on the screen.  I would say this is easily the best portion of the movie.  Cam Girls however marked a staggering decline in the movie for me with some really stilted acting and a rambling script.  A few of the situations were at least darkly humorous but the further it went along the less interested I became.  In its conclusion there is a flood of exposition about some wildly supernatural events that really hadnt been implicated at all prior to that moment and the voice modulation rears its ugly head again.  These problems would prove to be the downfall for the final segment for me as well over complication and explanation of a concept that didnt require it.  Just show me these girls doing creepy gross things dont have them recite a novel to me about fallen angels and ancient lore.  Not only does it detract from the shock of the violence by offering a distraction it shines a light on the acting and writing and in this case neither of those are quite strong enough to withstand that kind of focus.  Sadly the only thing positive I could say about this one is that the gore effects look pretty good.  Amandas Revenge rounds out the segments and unfortunately really only continues to expose the problems found in previous portions.  The acting is pretty bad and there is a ton a ton of dialogue.  There are also several plot points that are started that make the whole thing unnecessarily complex the main girl has a mother who was in a psychiatric hospital after killing some people and now this girl has been sexually assaulted but now she is being stalked by some entity at night and shes developing some kind of powers.  One of those plot points would have probably been enough maybe two.  Its simply too much as it is and I became dreadfully bored of the whole thing after a while.  There were some really bad edits as well particularly during one of multiple sessions where the lead actress is monologuing to her camera.  Given how the dialogue flows the edits give the impression that she couldnt get her lines in one take which definitely hurt a scene that was already struggling to hold my attention.  The special effects in this segment arent terrible and the creature design I found to be alright fairly creepy without revealing too much.  Unfortunately by the time that we get there my disinterest was already pretty firmly in place.  I do appreciate the variety of concept for each of the shorts and some of the core ideas are really interesting.  The special effects are solid given the low budget and the first half of the film as a whole is pretty decent.  Sadly some really stilted performances feeding off a verbose and bloated script really ruin the buildup once we move into the last half.  I think this project shows creativity and a potential for the creators to produce a quality feature but it doesnt live up to the potential itself.My Rating ,HorrorReviewed,dglayhu,1,t5_3hso6
