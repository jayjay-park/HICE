10458812,0,t3_5pss07,RIP. Its pretty sad to see how many are dancing on its grave. Why is comparative advantage so difficult for people to understand? Why cant people see the benefit in growing softpower influence in Southeast Asia? Why cant people understand that killing this deal just gives China the opportunity to corner an alternative deal?,globalistshills,dctm1a5,18,t5_3hiyp

More worryingly though while Marines father only received . of the vote in the second round Marine is currently polling at  for the second round and that is against a far more agreeable politician than her father was competing againsta popular slogan in  was vote for the crook not the fascist.

11209167,0,t1_df0vxub,A few years ago I actually gave it some thought based on what Ive heard secondhand and came to the conclusion that Rawls must not really have thought the whole maximin thing through because if you took it seriously youd have to implement policies to promote current consumption at the expense of investment and keep economic growth at zero the logic being that investment benefits future people at the expense of present people and with economic growth future people are better off than present people.I later found out that Rawls actually did think it through and decided that zero economic growth was a good idea. Im not sure if that should raise or lower his status in my eyes but either way its not high.TLDR Veil of ignorance is okay lexicographic preferences r dumb.,globalistshills,df2joh0,2,t5_3hiyp

11515760,0,t1_dg0orc5,North Korea sees its nuclear weapons as a tool to achieve exactly what you mentioned a reunification on their terms or at least a better treaty for them. They also see them as an insurance against any external threat. Their nuclear capabilities is their life insurance.

11646406,0,t1_dgg48nq,I skimmed the articles but Im not sure  this addresses my moral hazard argument. My understanding is that vice taxes are intended to a reduce consumption of goods that create negative externalities and b raise revenue for the government. I dont think that b can be justified if you arent doing a and doing it agressively because then youre just taxing people for being addicts which is immoral on its face.As far as inelasticity goes alcohol for example is inelastic to an extent if you raised the price of every can or bottle by  youd see a drop in consuption for sure. Im not convinced that anything less than extreme measures will decrease consumption and I think the government has a strong incentive to not increase vice taxes to a such an impactful level due to the increase in revenue.,globalistshills,dgg4tyv,1,t5_3hiyp
