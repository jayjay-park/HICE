3188205,0,t1_cosfc4i,Thanks!I used particle board because I quickly went over budget but I just wanted to get it built. Ive finished a redesign and will begin version  soon. Theres going to be better wood all around notbuttjoints and a new leg system...all though I hadnt considered a screwing mechanism for the height. That would be so much better. So great back to the drawing board!,Woodworkingplans,cosghbd,2,t5_2vaev
4348931,0,t1_csfdux7,Thanks for the response this is very helpful stuff.For the barrel nuts what would be a better option?  The goal is to be able to unscrew the legs for transportation.As to the plexi the size being a problem is something I wasnt anticipating but it makes a lot of sense.  I think Ill have to revisit the design and add cross beams for support.  Do you think that  cross beams at the ends and in the middle would provide enough support?  Then the unsupported plexi would be in  halves each . x . x ..Edit I could also do two mid posts to further distribute the weight?,Woodworkingplans,csfuugr,1,t5_2vaev
4675714,0,t1_cst0e7g,This wastes a lot of wood.Look at the area circled. These little pieces are worthless if you want the V to point down and their lengths could have been used to make the other pieces longer and not wasted.,Woodworkingplans,ctjx9hi,1,t5_2vaev
7096936,0,t3_4cq06f,gt quick ways to make real joinery on sketchupIve been watching Matthias Wandel  He has a few good tutorials on jointery.  The important part I took from it was how critical components are.  You could make your x cchannel or whatever a component and reuse it.Ive tried the warehouse as already mentioned.  The quality is all over the place though.  Most of what you described are all basic shapes easily produced yourself and at the quality you desire.  Id go that route.,Woodworkingplans,d1kt3fc,3,t5_2vaev
7631390,0,t1_d39cdsw,Honestly Id rather see that that most of the pallet stuff I see. If youre taking the pallet apart to use the wood then in my eyes youre not really using a pallet. Youre just using wood. ,Woodworkingplans,d39nbqx,2,t5_2vaev
9450623,0,t1_d9dvf1z,I may. Ill look into it and make my decision soon. When I walked around Lowes the other day I noticed there was a ton of plywood. Would you recommend anything in particular? ,Woodworkingplans,d9dxlq1,2,t5_2vaev
