Last season for example a mere  points and two draws in the relegation matches were sufficient for the HSV to stay in the league.As for the upcoming matches. Freiburg is really struggling at the moment having lots of injured players and their pitch was usually a good place for us. So one or three points arent granted but expecting some points isnt too farstreched. Any point versus Bayern is a bonus or more like any not too bad looking negative goal difference. D Cologne isnt very strong at home this season and considering their not so convincing win against Dutts team in the first half of the season I think its fair to look forward to some needed points. Anyway things never turn out the way you expect. ,svw,cp3x5jz,2,t5_2t2p0

And Bremen is certainly one of the better choices you could make. gtoutsider to the area that I should know about the club and history etc?That is VERY broad. I think people could answer that if you would narrow it down a bit.One thing you should know about the current situation. It is though. Very though. This season will be really difficult for us and we will most likely face fighting relegation. The team has a lot of potential for the coming years but we need to make it past this season. On the other hand this team is beautiful and has arguably the best general fanbase in the whole country. We might play like shit and face relagation but we will still cheer every matchday and try to support as good as possible.,svw,cvqbkmx,3,t5_2t2p0
