846165,0,t1_ch0g0he,Thank you! For color we lock our edit in FCP X and take it into Resolve. Once in Resolve I usually end up only ever using  or  nodes to get a grade I like. My first node balances the image fixing any color cast and setting exposure levels. I make sure my blacks arent crushed below  and highlights arent blown out above  unless we couldnt avoid that when shooting.For the majority of the time I then use FilmConvert on my second node. They have a great camera preset for the BMCC that I think really brings the footage to life. I usually dial down the curve to taste and put the grain at  unless BampW. I think the BMCC has a nice subtle grain to the image already that I like.Anytime I add a third node would be a layer node to remove chrominance noise. Shooting on the BMCC weve learned to always try to ETTR on all shots. It seems to bring out the best dynamic range color and low noise levels for the camera. It really helps when working with those clips in Resolve.,weddingvideography,ch0gofw,1,t5_2tm8b

1358644,0,t3_29bxky,From a non videograoher stand point its painfully obvious when you switch from one angle to another. The white balance saturation exposure and contrast were so different. I dont know if this was the difference between cameras or settings. It was the most noticeable for me when she was about to walk down the aisle and then it changed to the front of her face.,weddingvideography,cimlh4w,1,t5_2tm8b

1601992,0,t3_2cleew,Thats a tough one to deal with. Because even if youve been over all of those things with the BampG theres always those assholes who think they know better than you or want to criticize for some weird misconception they have about wedding videography.I have a specific clause in my contract that says hey you hired me because you like my style of work. Im the artist the director the producer the editor and everything else. I make decisions about how I shoot where I shoot when I shoot etc. No one else does this but me. If you have a problem with this you shouldnt sign this contract.I have had things like you describe happen once or twice. I try to gently state that soandso has hired me and theyre on the contract and weve worked out how its going to go down. Even if you are the one whos giving them the money to pay for my service they are the names on the contract not you and my duty is to them. I try to say that calmly and in much fewer words but you get the idea. Generally its like this Im sorry but weve made specific plans based on the brides needs and her budget. We dont record every second of the day because that wouldnt be fun for anyone. Something like that.I have another clause called Cheerful Cooperation. It says that we all agree to cheerfully cooperate to get the job done. It says that if I have a problem with anyone at the wedding Im going to bring it to the BampG and seek their help in resolving it. Havent actually had to do that yet thankfully.But yeah theres no easy way to deal with any of these things on the actual wedding day. But it happens.,weddingvideography,cjh3m5v,3,t5_2tm8b
2225455,0,t3_2jq363,What are you shooting on currently?    If nothing I would advise against spending  on a camera before lenses.  However thats just so I can sleep better at night.  If youre loaded and money is no issue you might as well get the best.  Ill just be jealous.     Unless of course you shoot video in another industry and you want to switch to a larger sensor camera Then ignore everything I said and get the C.  More flexibility.,weddingvideography,clmpj9p,1,t5_2tm8b
2647550,0,t3_2q7uy8,I fully expected to open this to find Dont shoot weddings.On  I think you went too far the other direction.  You should always have a safe wide shot locked down on a tripod and then you can take a second camera to run out and try to do something fancy.  Obviously if youre alone this only works for static shots but its very doable and common practice.,weddingvideography,cn4605m,1,t5_2tm8b
3500431,0,t1_cpqzjiw,The ceremony is edited so that we cut back and forth between the cameras as needed and the ceremony plays in real time i.e. from beginning to end with the actual audio. We typically have one or two cameras on tripods and one or two freemoving on video monopods to get more interesting angles. If one of our camerapersons needs to step in front of another that would a good place to cut to a different camera. As a rule of thumb you dont want to stay with one angle for longer than about four seconds. Hence three cameras.Audio is usually recorded via a Sony UWP wireless lav going to a stationary camera that rolls through the entire ceremony usually one a heavy tripod shooting down the aisle with a clear shot of the bride amp groom. The other cameras are recording scratch audio via shotgun mics to help with sync. We also have a Tascam DRd that we will patch into a PA system if available. Buy a couple pads if you plan to do this... our last ceremony peaked a bit even at the lowest possible settings.Our dayof usually looks like this I shoot stills and then we have a main videographer and their assistant. Shooting stills can usually be handled by one person in a pinch but you always need two videographers IMO always want two angles and there is a lot of gear to carry. Never have one person do both photo and video as it will sacrifice both. Always plan some time preceremony to setup at least  minutes or more. We do this as its really the only time we use our tripod. After we can switch to monos and not have to change it up for the rest of the night.,weddingvideography,cpr9vlj,2,t5_2tm8b
3922700,0,t3_35d3ur,Depends on how long Ill be shooting for. p takes up more space than p and that space could be invaluable in given situations. I shoot in  whenever I get the chance to since it gives me more options in post like you said. However if Im shooting something I know I wont be using slow mo in I just shoot in p just to save me the trouble.,weddingvideography,cr3f9re,1,t5_2tm8b

5773826,0,t3_3t7v17,Great work! All kinds of great moments captured I liked the montage against the wood wall you did. And man! A lot of time lapses its always tough for me to get those with so much other stuff going on great work on those too. I thought your audio sounded pretty good its tough to have perfect audio every time with not everything being under your control. As for music Ive had to work with a lot of songs that are soooo played out and drab I want the cinematic perfection! Something like Hammock or Explosions In The Sky. But I commit to the song they pick and do my best with it and they are always really happy with it. In the end its their video. Do you make a shorter trailer also? Somewhere around the  minute range? If not its something to consider its a much better length to share with extended friends on FB. Also when I was starting out if someone picked a song i didnt like I would make a second trailer to the music of my choice and use that to advertise. A little easier with a  min vs. a min  As for the focus and color its tough! Live events and not always a lot of time to prep. I thought you did a great job keep up the good work. Some suggestions maybe look for more opportunities to get interesting angles especially during their prep seemed like most shots were from eye level and not much DOF. Might also be good to jump around with the editing a little more not just sequential order and still find a way to keep a good story line. My company is Solefire Films.

6561887,0,t3_44uc8g,I really like the pacing of this edit! Great music choice as well. My biggest critique Im also new to wedding videography is in using a slider or with kinetic shots in general. I find that clips that begin moving while they can come to rest like your beautifully executed tablecenterpiece shot usually benefit from cutting while still in motion. I think cutting on constant motion can make moving shots look a lot more intentional. Thank you for sharing your work!,weddingvideography,czy1xzv,3,t5_2tm8b

7407764,0,t1_d2k53ec,This is the correct answer.  Get a ND filter or raise the shutter speed.  Honestly most people wouldnt notice a higher speed and when you need to run and gun so much during a fast paced wedding day  messing with filters is usually the last thing you want to deal with. ,weddingvideography,d2k7qcc,2,t5_2tm8b

8802055,0,t3_50ohyi,For us its giving proper time to the video guys.  Photographers tend to try to hog all the time.  Ask if he plans on setting up shots or if hes just straight filming.   If he plans to set up shots please make time for him.  Dont let the photographer run all over him ,weddingvideography,d75vyf1,0,t5_2tm8b
9182025,0,t1_d8fvll4,I like using the Clear Image Zoom as an alternative to APSC mode. Get to shoot at a resolution a little higher than p without a significant drop in quality. Battery life is a different story ,weddingvideography,d8fw0up,1,t5_2tm8b

10559185,0,t3_5r6i05,I dont have an example to show you but mine are an hour long. I use all the footage from the day covering the audio with music with for things like preparation shots.
