Im intriqued on your adventure.Edit Do not go for the Robin Olds style he broke regs during Vietnam to build comradery. Got shut down when he came back stateside.,Moustache,cehwys4,1,t5_2qmmq
113385,0,t1_cer8pgj,Eh maybe. My beard comes in more sparsely than my mustache so it doesnt look better for me. But I also think that sometimes you have to look less than great for a while to get the look you want.,Moustache,cercaoz,1,t5_2qmmq

736022,0,t3_22jtvd,Honestly everything in this picture screams obnoxious. Just because all of the little flair you have is considered hipstercool doesnt mean they go well together. You look like a total douche. That being said you could be cool as shit and far be it from me to judge somebody so harshly without knowing them. If you like what you like thats what you like and good for you for not giving a shit its your lifebody. Hope my perspective is helpful just being as straightforward amp honest as I can. ,Moustache,cgnxtya,5,t5_2qmmq

820392,0,t1_cgxivlz,This is actually the first time Ive tried tying the moustache back and my stepmom had these tiny clothes pins.

2542801,0,t1_cmqdu3c,Dont cut it. Get Firehouse Wacky Tacky. Lay it on as thick as you need to to curl the ends. Let it set then run a comb through it  keep the comb perpendicular to your face. That should break up the wetheavy waxed look. If not give it a a little heat from a blow drier on low a good  from your face just to soften the wax. Comb again. Worst case you decide that doesnt work try something else or cut it.Oh if you regularly twist it  either when styling or otherwise  make a habit of curling TOWARDS YOUR FACE.

4758641,0,t1_ctu3smo,I lucked out with that. I cant grow a beard at all otherwise Id totally have one. My moustache however grows in very full. The best advice I got came from someone that has one of the most epic mustaches Ive seen. He said to give it at least two months. Most people chicken out by then and shave it off. But if you put in the time youll let it really develop. So maybe give it more time if you havent and see if it fills out. Best of luck!,Moustache,ctudekd,2,t5_2qmmq
4772747,0,t1_ctw4s2i,The hair was pretty soon after a shower its usually has more of a fringe and doesnt show much of forehead.But if there is one thing I have learnt from this thread its that I need a haircut.Next day off Im going straight to the barbers lol,Moustache,ctw5bhs,1,t5_2qmmq
5070376,0,t1_cuwkca8,you actually want the middle to be the longest that way when you part it and comb it sideways it has more hair to catch and train sideways.  Otherwise it always pulls back and just hangs straight downor straight up into your noseyou curl it up into the shape you want then trim the ends.  This ends up making the hair on the outsides shorter than the hair on the insides.,Moustache,cux677g,1,t5_2qmmq
