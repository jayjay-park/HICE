I understand the physiological aspects and problems with this wallahi method. I dont know another thought that came into my head was that im not actually recovering and that im basically forcing myself not to PMO which technically doesnt help me that much because Im not controlling the urge Im just setting a big barrier between me and it. I dont know if that was a rationalization from my PMO side but ive been thinking deeply about it. Am I actually recovering? Well the physical changes are coming through they are bound to if you dont PMO for a long time. But I want to beat this urge for the sake of Allah and I dont want to be a slave to this selfish sin. So i feel like Im not beating my addiction that much more just keeping it quiet locking it in a cage. But if I do break this wallahi resolve then what next? Is that it? Will I be done? Gone? No way to beat the urge? To be honest I genuinely dont care. This addiction has gone on long enough and this is like my final go at beating it this is my .    ,MuslimNoFap,chur05t,1,t5_2zlfl

Allah says Say O My servants who have transgressed against themselves by sinning do not despair of the mercy of Allah. Indeed Allah forgives all sins. Indeed it is He who is the Forgiving the Merciful.Also  He said And who despairs of the mercy of his Lord except for those astray?Both are wrong but Despairing is worst than Sinning.

If you cant get out try learning something via the internet. The world is in your hands.

6283060,0,t3_41libu,WsalaamIt depends on you and your circumstances. I dont like filtering methods such as openDNSK etc because they give you a false sense of security when in fact they can be circumvented in my experience.But if you actually remove your access to all your devices there is physically no way for you to view internet P. Not only this but it is a big commitment that sends a very strong signal to your brain that youre serious about this.Not only is this problem a heinous sin it is crippling to our lives. You need to be serious. If its feasible for you Id get rid of it for a couple of months at least until you feel stronger. Sacrifice it for Allahs sake. A digital detox will work wonders for getting over procrastination and internet addiction as well until you can use them in a mature manner. Dont throw it away of course but do something such that it wont be easy to get it back worst case scenario sell it. May Allah grant you success.P.S. If you do get rid of it do NOT let your guard down. Tricks like filtering getting rid of devices etc. can make the journey easier but are NOT a substitute for vigilance perseverance and willpower. There will always be tempting and haraam things to look at and the longer you abstain the less it takes to excite you.

Even if it does not brrak fast it will definitely lead you to something which will break it. In Quran we are told you not even go close to zina. Like take paths which will keep you away even from something which may lead to it. One of the important thing that you should do is to avoid too much eating during ramadan. Eat less. The purpose is for you to feel hunger. At iftaar eat what will be mere sufficient according to the hadith to divide one third for air one third for water and one third for food.

9948578,0,t1_db49hfq,You need to make yourself understand that everything returns to Allah. Everything. We will all meet our Lord one day and stand in front of Him. So ignoring His commandments such as prayer and the things he forbade will ultimately hurt us. The way to fix this issue is to really sit down and mentally reinforce the grandeur of Allah swt. Understand he has control of every single aspect in your life. He knows your situation better than you know it  yourself so seek his assistance. You must know in your heart that there is no escape from Allah except towards Allah.,MuslimNoFap,db4bq4r,1,t5_2zlfl

11167275,0,t1_dexbwkk,Everything you wrote is helpful.. except for Allah being the only companion I need. Dont fool yourself. People say this all the time. Only the hereafter matters for example is often said by people who dont strive for dunya as well. I knew a brother who had this mindset he wanted to get married was always at the masjid always taking care of his deen. When it came time to do the nikah everybody looked at him like he was crazy. Its not that he didnt have the means to get rent an apartment for them to live in but rather because he hadnt tried. In taking care of his deen he forgot his obligations here in dunya. Rather than putting extra hours into building his skills he put extra hours into prayers. Theres a reason why Allah decided for us to pray  times per day not all day. Same goes for everything else in life such as having companions. You need them. Otherwise when disaster strikes you are alone in facing it. Look at the homeless people in the streets of your city. A good number of them were faithful people. When disaster struck and they had no friends they turned to begging. ,MuslimNoFap,dexsrts,2,t5_2zlfl
11222461,0,t1_df3grj3,Just cut out all the triggers is my best advice social media certain tv shows etc. You have to make the sacrifices if you wanna succeed at this. Also mind discipline if you have desire then try thinking of something unpleasant to counter the desire dwelling on lustful thoughts usually leads to relapse so its good to get away from it asap.I have relapsed before this  month streak numerous times you just have to learn from each mistake and not repeat it.My life is much more peaceful and stress free. Of course I think there are more changes that should be made but I definitely have a anxiety free life now alhamdulillah. Also I do get a bit of attention from opposite gender which never happened before but I suppose we save that benefit for marriage lol All in all its definitely worth it.,MuslimNoFap,df41vv7,2,t5_2zlfl
