The only thing that remains from the old days is the law of silence no one from these villages will say anything.A small anecdote and actual story from the city of Rethymnon to understand the situation here The father of a friend of mine is a high school teacher which gives private lessons to kids of these problematic villages. During the s for the first time a police helicopter came to Rethymnon equiped with cameras in order to find the marijuana plantations. As a result a record number of plantations was found and uprooted and.... over half of the students stopped the private lessons because the parents couldnt afford them anymore.,greece,ckj4g02,4,t5_2qh8i

2342544,0,t1_cm187wz,gt I dont and would never claim to speak for all Greeks but I was born there and Ive lived there as a child and as an adult so Im guessing Im slightly more in touch than you. No people of your type are not even in touch with your own noses. Every stereotype that Western European imperialist nations have in their image of the allegedly corrupt lazy work culture in Greece is true of the actual working conditions at my current job in New Jersey. So I get to see what people do with the free time they have at work.  It is mostly distract themselves on the cell phone kick up drama dust gossip talk endlessly about meaningless nonsense distractions like sports or the products of the entertainment industry. What kind of answers do you think you will get if you ask such people about the conditions of American life the people who just want to waste their time? Not very good ones because they are not even much interested in anything outside of distracting themselves from their actual condition as exhibited how they spend their life instead of live their life in their free time. This is a quote from Vassilis Vassilikos that describes the modern working life too aptly and sadly This then was life? To wake and work just to go to sleep again because you had worked?The Few Things I Know About Glafkos Thrassakis A Novel. p.  Probably just like my coworkers you spend most of your time in distraction and a fair bet since you live in a country with a big drinking culture numbing yourself with alcohol to avoid such realizations. And when someone like say a vegan or maybe even someone with an anticapitalist orientation appears or maybe it is someone straightedge or maybe it is someone who refuses to own a car and is bicycling infront of your car forcing you to go a few km slower till you can overtake them people like you get very angry!  To wit. Based on what I actually know about Greeks when I visit my paternal village in Achaia most the village will already know I am vegan before I arrive because Greeks are quite gossipy especially compared to isolated Americans with their small nonlocal social circles and have less of a concept of privacy and there is not much for my father who lives in an isolated village to discuss at the kafenio so they probably already know his son is vegan and his mom made him sothe last bit is not true once again. Similarly my uncle will know before I arrive in Korinthos because his brother told him. gt Also youve scored a total of  karma in this post as well as the  who downvoted the post. So you know no one really agrees with you.You should check now what the ratings of your ignorant noncontributing self are in this thread. I already wrote so many times my father already visited me after I was vegan and went back to Greece but you still act like I have to invent some elaborate backstory lie because in your thick skull you go by what you fancy about the dire social effects of being vegan rather than what is. Also popularity does not mean anything. Many contemporary parents think teaching their kids to move in overtly sexualized ways like twerking when they are as young as five is not only cute but worthy of recording and uploading to the net today for the world to admire. If you go to rTurkey many perhaps most salivate over the misfortune of Kurds at the hands of ISIS and Kurdish misery gloating posts are popular. In a recent thread on relationships there was alot of backlash because a vegan mentioned they wanted to raise any child with their nonvegan partner vegan. In an observant comment someone pointed out that woman was attacked far more viciously and given far more vitriol than any of the numerous admitted cheaters posting to rrelationships.It would be nice if I could get another relevant comment which I wont get from this Australian presuming to be the President of speaking on behalf of Greeks. ,greece,cm1914t,-86,t5_2qh8i

He commited armed bank robbery with freaking Kalashnikovs! He is also unrepenting and a real risk of escape or repeat offense if allowed to exit the prison.He is also a fantastic subject to exploit for political rewards by the government opposition because He is a kid He had his best friend shot dead by the police He is a fighter against the system as they present him. He wants to study always a noble cause. The system is refusing him his studies actually only him exiting the prison. They now pass law so he can study inside the prison which he does not find acceptable.So many political parties are using the sentimental side of the situation to appeal to the population completely disregarding the fact that he is a dangerous criminal. It works because sentiments gt reason.He is also part of a very wealthy and prominent family so im assuming that some behind the scenes influencing has been taking place there.Romanos knows that he is being played and has expressed his disdain for his selfappointed saviours or champions.In my view the kid should be allowed to study inside the prison and not be allowed to leave until he either serves his sentence or he has proven that he is no longer a danger.,greece,cmonmjq,10,t5_2qh8i

2583106,0,t3_2pdvmu,Greece Revisits the PanicAntonis Samaras wants to scare voters rather than try to persuade them.Stock markets took a tumble last week as the announcement of a snap presidential election in Athens triggered fears about how lasting Greeces reformandrecovery drive will be. This panic about democracy is instructive.The vote for the ceremonial role of president which will likely take three rounds of balloting in the parliament over the next few weeks has become a test of confidence in Prime Minister Antonis Samaras. He will be forced to call a snap parliamentary election next month if he cant secure  votes in the member body for his preferred candidate by the third round. He needs support from  independent members to hit that threshold and hes not certain to get it. If he fails voters will elect a new parliament at the end of January.Mr. Samarass decision to call the presidential election that threatens his government appears to be a gambit to neutralize the increasingly popular farleft Syriza party which promises to undo painful reforms and force creditors to take bigger haircuts on Greek debt. With negotiations for Greeces exit from its bailout looming Mr. Samaras seems to hope voters will return his unpopular government to power rather than risk further chaos by handing Syriza power for the exit talks.That strategy is symptomatic of the broader political failures that have brought Greece to this pass. Since  Athens has reduced pensions healthcare spending and government employment and as a result borrowing costs have fallen and the economy was showing signs of growing again. But hardly any Greek politician including the Prime Minister has bothered to try to persuade voters of the merits of undertaking painful reforms today in exchange for faster sustainable growth tomorrow.On the contrary Mr. Samaras has tried to scale back some reforms ostensibly to show his independence from the troika of the European Commission European Central Bank and International Monetary Fund that have orchestrated the bailout. In some cases this has been just as well as with plans for tax cuts to roll back some of the IMFs illadvised hikes. But he has also dragged his feet on many other measures such as further reducing the bloated government headcount waiting for the troika to force his hand and then blaming the foreigners when the measures are unpopular.This thebailoutmademe approach hasnt built anything resembling a political consensus behind reform let alone a broader understanding among voters that Greeces crisis was largely Greeces fault. No wonder Syriza has enjoyed such success arguing reforms were entirely unnecessary. Mr. Samaras himself was against the bailout and its attendant reforms when it began in  before he was for it after he won election in . Now his strategy is to scare voters rather than persuade them.Mr. Samarass candidate may still win the presidential election but investors will remember it as a closerun thing. Before anyone bemoans the fickleness of Greek voters look at this episode instead as a warning of what happens when the political class attempts to foist policies on voters without troubling to do the legwork of persuasion. It would help if rather than fearing democracy European leaders got better at it.,greece,cmvqzkj,4,t5_2qh8i

2899441,0,t3_2sqm6u,Sorry for the late response but I just came across this.  And sorry for the ranty nature of this comment.Is the Greek consulate in question the one in New York?  If it is I feel so bad for you for that place is staffed with the surliest laziest and most incompetent people out of any consulate I have dealt with in this town Ive dealt with plenty including ones from developing countries i.e. Nigeria and the Greek consulate takes the cake.Im guessing most of the people in there have gotten their jobs via nepotism as that is the only way their behavior can be explained.First off their hours of operation are limited to ampm in NYC!  This isnt siesta town people at least stay open till five.  Second when you go in there they herd everyone into one room where they wait to be called in some cases hours to go to another room to wait!  Once there the staff are yelling at people yelling at each other and randomly call people without regard for who came in first.On various occasions that I had the misfortune to have to go there people have told me because waiting forever people strike up conversations that. Greece requires models to prove that they have vast amounts of savings in a bank before it allows them into the country to have a shoot according to the NY consulate staff.. Greek citizens like yourself have to get some special pictures taken for their Greek passports that have strict requirements that are very different from the loose rules we have in the United States yet the consulate sends them to nearby shops to get their passport photos taken which are often not approved by the Greek state.  They are informed of their disapproval eight weeks later when they have to start all over again.  Why they dont have a photographer staffed in there to take the pictures is anyones guess.  Or even have someone that has the authority to approve the pictures on site.  I mean they even have a representative from the Greek army in there so its not like they cant.. This past week I visited and they were lacking the person that mans the front desk.  The bursar doubled as the bursar and receptionist.  He told me they got rid of the receptionist because of austerity.  They got rid of the lowest paid person to save money?  What?. This past week on my last visit they were installing security cameras in the waiting room where I doubt any crime has ever occurred as the Greek consul is located in the citys wealthiest zip code.  Not to mention they have this security scanner just like in airports there for years now and even though it beeps as everyone goes through nobody seems to care.  What was the point of that thing?Having said all this so long as you smile at the staff they ultimately warm up to you and you will be spared the yelling that everyone else receives.  You still have to wait though.Ive even been to their business office which is located in another building and that place is even more tragic as it seems those people are so bored out of their minds the entire staff huddles around me and offers such great business advice as pointing me to various websites.  I leave that place wondering how many weeks will go by before they get another visitor.ETA For a country whose tourism sector accounts for a tenth of its GDP this is not a good way to make a first impression.,greece,cnxo71z,1,t5_2qh8i

Different dialects would be difficult or unrecognizable koinic greek should be easy its basically what you hear sthn ekklesia doric aeolic etc not so much especially doric. Naturally greeks of today would have the easiest time underatanding and learning the dialects.  The pontiaka dialect and cyproit dialects might be difficult for some to understand today but thats not a good comparison to doric or aeolic to koine. Mycenenan isnt ionianattic or doric influenced so it would be the hardest to understand and learn. It is hard to know exactly what the doric spartan or doric macedonian dialect was spoken like but compared to an attic or ionian dialect it would be the hardest for you to understand because modern greek is basically descended from the ionianattic dialect and most of the doric dialects died out by the th century except for some small dialects like tsakonian.,greece,cpnzzlm,0,t5_2qh8i

4432821,0,t1_cspfv82,Russia Today you forgot that the Europhile fanatic Greek traitors hate Russia on behalf of their West European masters and handlers. Putin kicked out the foreign NGOs so they cannot play color revolution there also. Those ass lickers hate any country that stands up. They want everyone at the knees for pointy headed NorthWestern European cowards who according to a gallup survey wont fight anyway. Here is something related I posted in rEurope a while agoand if I posted it to Greece the traitors would have downvoted it to hell for writing against pointy headed always right Germany     There is a good conference that explains this entitled Is Mercantilism Doomed to Fail? If you look at the CIA factbook Germany has a GDP of . trillion and a whopping . trillion of exports. Germany has a very unbalanced mercantilist economy compared to the rest of the world highly dependant on exports with a very weak domestic demand. When Germany suppressed wages artificially by having a long wage freeze and even cutting wages it artificially improved German kompetitiveness. especially in the EU and eurozone with reduced trade barriers and a single currency. Germany looked and looks at the EU to ruthlessly allow German companies to expand at the expense of the rest of the Eurozone. But for economies that do not have almost  of their GDP expressed in exports such measures are outright suicidal. In Spain and Italy two large Eurozone economies exports are  of GDP. When you impose austerity you kill their economies. I would highly recommend the talk of the nonchauvnist German economist at that conference  Heiner Flassbeck Is Mercantilism Doomed to Fail? Some more sources  Germanys record trade surplus is a bigger threat to euro than GreecegtThis is the fifth consecutive year that Germanys surplus has been above pc of GDP. The EUs Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure states that the Commission should launch infringement proceedings if this occurs for three years in a row unless there is a clear reason not to.AndgtgtEmploying unusually sharp language the U.S. on Wednesday openly criticized Germanys economic policies and blamed the eurozone powerhouse for dragging down its neighbors and the rest of the global economy.gtIn its semiannual currency report the Treasury Department identified Germanys exportled growth model as a major factor responsible for the nation currency blocs weak recovery. The U.S. identified Germany ahead of its traditional target China and the mostrecent perceived problem country Japan in the key findings section of the report.gt...gtGermanys anemic pace of domestic demand growth and dependence on exports have hampered rebalancing at a time when many other euro area countries have been under severe pressure to curb demand and compress imports in order to promote adjustment Treasury said in its report. The net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area as well as for the world economy.,greece,cspg1gs,1,t5_2qh8i

5127253,0,t1_cv12dsl,Funnily enough the same stereotypes exist for Cypriot Turks. They are viewed to be more Cypriot than Turks. Cypriot Turks were once Greek Christians like the inhabitants of Crete. Cypriot Turks kept marrying other Cypriot Turks or children of Turks from Greece. So basically the whole island is genetically Greek.  ,greece,cv40yhg,1,t5_2qh8i

A kitchen yes but not couches and such maybe if your lucky a bed and make sure  the contract specifies the time of the contract  also check www.xe.gr and use google translate but you wont find much in english so search in greek and ask a greek speaker to talk on the phone,greece,cvssc1y,1,t5_2qh8i

Several of them and usually the cheapest ones will have it readily available to pick up just make sure that it is available for pick up before going there!Will you be staying in Athens?,greece,d1qrsoj,13,t5_2qh8i

The power is in your hands never forget that you forge your destiny. There will always be drama thus we are Greeks weather you like it or not but as a previous user said kids will make it all go away and as long as she is willing to show some will to speak a bit of Greek and accept some of our traditions that also helps a lot.Tldr just stop wasting energy on less important things and enjoy your life,greece,d2qz11j,5,t5_2qh8i

Never knew so many different empires existed in Greece and I would have never thought in a million years Ancient Greece could be considered as having more to do with Eastern cultures than it does Western white Civilization but I guess that really does make sense considering its proximity to the Eastern Mediterranean.  I personally always viewed Greece as the beginning of the Western World. ,greece,d6b2fts,1,t5_2qh8i

8851060,0,t1_d76syws,gtWhat are some cool facts about its history I should know? It was founded by Alexander the Great and named in honour of his sister. Its the second largest city in Greece and has been a major city for most of its history being the second largest city in the Roman Balkans and in the Byzantine Empire. It was also the second biggest city in the Balkans during Ottoman times until it was surpassed by a regrowing Athens after Athens became the second capital of the Modern Greek State. Thessaloniki also referred to as Salonica or Thessalonica has elements of culture and architecture from all those periods as well as rivalry with Athens Im Athenian so Ill go ahead and make fun of their nonexistent metro for old times sake. Their metro construction has been severely held back because they keep discovering Ancient Greek Byzantine and Roman ruins under the city all the time so all of Greece makes fun of them for taking over two decades to build a metro.

Lets not mince our words The heroinvestors resisting the trend deserve at least some public recognition.Unfortunately he makes a mistake. It is not slipping into the underdeveloped category it is underdeveloped. Athens is a result of the socialistic economic policies of the past few decades the city has seen little development and investment. It hurts to say but Athens is not a developed city in any regard and I look forward to economic reforms that will lead to more investment and development in the city. Athens like all of Greece has a lot of investment potential. Ill remain optimistic ,greece,dcfcb4c,1,t5_2qh8i

The first known as Primordialism or Perennialism sees nationalism as a natural phenomenon. It holds that although the concept nationhood may be recent nations have always existed. The second paradigm is Ethnosymbolism which is a complex perspective seeking to explain nationalism by contextualizing it throughout history as a dynamic evolutionary phenomenon and by further examining the strength of nationalism as a result of the nations subjective ties to national symbols imbued with historical meaning. The third and most dominant paradigm is Modernism which sees nationalism as a recent phenomenon that needs the structural conditions of modern society in order to exist. ?  .  .Edit    .           .       werent even a thing then.            .

10933009,0,t3_5w5buc,Athens is the main place people interested in history visit. You shouldnt miss out on staying there for at least a few nights if youd like to pay a visit into the countrys most well known ancient sites and museums. Mykonos is an overrated partygoer location. Not much to do there during winter in terms of going out. Similarly for Santorini the island isnt as lively during winter but the majestic scenery its known for sure doesnt go away. But its too windy and theres no guarantee that the Aegean seas weather would do you any favors. IMO and based on the preferences youve provided us with you should consider traveling to mainland Greece perhaps visiting Olympia which is just as nice during winter. And in terms of Islands I think youd like Crete and Rhodes which are bigger and more lively during winter.  ,greece,de7nvl6,2,t5_2qh8i

11007535,0,t3_5x5zhk,I was there in the summer so I guess I should give you my impressions. First of all the place and trip are magical and every time I am back home I try for a day trip.I want to make the distinction between the museum being wheelchair accessible and the location as a whole. Delphi is literally built into a mountain. In many ways its a hiking trail rather than a temple. The steps are the ancient ones worn down and slippery plus gravel ones that I would hesitate to even call steps. This makes it prohibitevly difficult for wheel chair access as not all steps are even height there are narrow sharp turns uneven and rough terrain and lots of people. The ramp method might work in some sections but in others it would probably be unreliable at best. Also keep in mind that in the summer the sun beats down on you making sunstroke and heat exhaustion real threats. Simply stated its an issue of geography not accessibility.On the other hand the museum at the base is accessible very beautiful and well maintained and details the entire history from mythhistory through antiquity and modern times.If you are determined to reach the ancient stadium up top my advice is to attempt the carying on your back method although be careful with staying hydrated. If you only wish to reach the temple of Apollo half way up maybe the ramp method you propose could work since that part is mostly marble steps.,greece,defo8xl,7,t5_2qh8i

11099047,0,t3_5yggqc,Lived in Greece for a while recently.  nett if you really get that. Greece can have a funny way with ever new taxes at times should allow you to live and is more than minimum wage but not exactly great. Rent depends on where you want to be. Strangely for a big city town center is the shittiest part of town so stay away from Victoria square and surroundings as its full with migrants drug dealers and other not so nice people. Still ok to go to I guess but I personally wouldnt want to live there. Ive seen apartments available in Ambelokipi and Panormou little Asia   for  upwards. Theres cheap out there. Be prepared to pay quite a bit for everything else as taxes are high vat now? and it is not cheap to live in Athens. Most young people and people in the touristy center speak english. Older generation and once you leave the center tend to speak less but I never really had a problem. Good motivation to learn some Greek too. Awesome country and I loved it but high taxes made it impossible to earn a decent wage so I left again. Be prepared for ungodly bureaucracy and high taxes but I f you survive that its awesome. Also if you live and register yourself there all your paperwork tax number etc is in Greek. Get your work to help you. Finally private healthcare is recommended.,greece,deq2fq2,4,t5_2qh8i

Here let me give it a shot. the Clinton foundation was getting money from very questionable sources while Hillary was in office. Did you notice the sharp decline in donations after she lost? This was a prime example of a high tier politician being influenced from foreign powers. Granted G.Bush fucked the whole M.East. Are we still questioning how the M.East became even more unstable during Obama and Clinton? Do we have to mention again the refugees who are overwhelmingly adult males and are taking hostage the countries they have landed on?  Are we still questioning the Fast and Furious? Are we still questioning the overwhelming use of Drones and their  rate of failure thus creating even more enemies? Are we sill questioning the fact that Michigan Flint still doesnt have water to drink after  years of Obama? and Trump recently redirected money to correct this? It is actually being done as we speak. Are we sill questioning the fact that government has expanded ten fold its power to spy on people while under Obama?,greece,dfhztws,2,t5_2qh8i
