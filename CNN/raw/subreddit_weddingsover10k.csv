5513956,0,t3_3na5zd,I know this post is probably not your top concern now but having just seen it I would say if you have a good relationship with her shes probably trying not to be the crazy MIL that everyone writes and complains about.  If you are able to talk to her just let her know that you love her and would love to spend some time with her.  Plan a day to look at flowers and have a girls luncheon together.  Reemphasize that you totally want her opinion and that you appreciate her being around but not intrusive.  ,weddingsover10k,cwggiar,1,t5_2vpl9
