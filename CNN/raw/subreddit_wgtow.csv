11296253,0,t1_dfcc3ml,It was never my intention to prove you wrong. Sorry for saying that earlier btw we all get in bad moods from time to time. It just infuriates me to see women voting for the mass importation of men who really do want to dominate and exploit them meanwhile they nitpick the men who want to protect them with constant accusations of microagressions and other such nonsense. Im just not sure anymore. Its very tempting to simply throw you to the wolves so you can see what a real patriarchy looks like. Add to all this that western women have no concept of race beyond the notion that white men are to blame for everything... it doesnt look good for western civilization. I get the feeling Im wasting my time  here but at least you might glean some context some framework for the animosity you might occasionally encounter at mgtow. Then again this is reddit youre a feminist and the burnt out husk of our culture is already in free fall. My guess is that your mind will remain unchanged until the day you are forced to don said apparel. Have a nice day and Allahs blessing upon you. ,wgtow,dfcewgl,3,t5_31ux8
