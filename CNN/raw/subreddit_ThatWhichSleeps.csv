1993821,0,t1_cksmu99,I agree with you in that aspect. The more shiny and honourable the heroes seem the more fun well get after crushing their bones. Just as how it was shown in the combat video when the beautiful lady was killed by the agent. In that moment I even felt sorry for her companions since that seemed like an excessive price to pay compared to the death of some minions and an agent.If the heroes were to be as toughlooking as my troops then maybe Id have to rethink my return since there would be no need for more nasty beasts crowding the world. I know Im exaggerating but I hope you understand. A little bit of seriousness could be welcomed but too much and they wont seem like the Light that has to overcome the terror we are.  ,ThatWhichSleeps,cktgf6c,1,t5_32a3x
