2473993,0,t3_2nvp61,Ive worked in fast food restaurants before  no way this happens. For starters theres specific contracts between the companies and restaurants to sell these specific products and those companies do send people to check up on the quality albeit rarely. If the soda company saw this on a large scale there would be lawsuits  theyre intentionally misrepresenting the product.Also theyd have to figure out a way to actually get the caffeine free stuff. Many restaurants get the syrup direct from the companys distributor. If this were happening it would involve people within cokepepsi distribution which would be a lot harder to pull off.Also the caffeine free stuff isnt made on the same scale as the normaldiet stuff. Theres a reason why caffeine free versions of coke and pepsi or whatever are hard to find  theres not much demand for them.Finally while I understand why youd think itd be cheaper when you manufacture a product on such a large scale the niche product is often more expensive. Whats more likely is the restaurant youre going to is accidentally via poor maintenance watering down the soda. Youre not noticing it because fountain soda always tastes different source water is carbonated then mixed with syrups in the lines as opposed to coming in a big keg or whatever. Calibration for these mixes can easily be thrown off. When you think watered down soda its hard to judge it when its just as fizzy. As a side note I know this is rsoda but  cups of soda a day isnt good for you. If you find yourself needing something to perk you up through the day tea is healthier contains as much or more caffeine typically and cheaper especially if you have access to hot water at your job. ,Soda,cmhhlag,4,t5_2s6d3

It is apple o it at this point but it is called Mass Soda short for Mass Street SodaIt contains most of our inventory we havent updated it in months but it still allows basic rating and tracking of over  items in our inventory. Hopefully that can get you started  we should have an update just as soon as we can. ,Soda,co0xrng,3,t5_2s6d3
