6727491,0,t1_d0f5ml0,I usually just dodge vs Teemo because I play this game to have fun and hes just unfun to play vs but theres worse matchups than him.However theres a few different things you can do vs lane lane bullies the biggest being taking a rune page to nullify some or a lot of their damage.Try to get them to push the wave early most lane bullies need level  to kill them unless you walk up to them and let them kill you. Just soak up as much farm as you can and do what you can early if you can get some jungle pressure you can do a complete  on these lanes with a killassist especially if they bring ignite instead of teleport. E max first with a dorans ring first back not first buy can help if you find that youre just completely zoned from the wave because you can always stack later but you always need gold income.Roam when the wave is pushed in at top and you cant do anything safely no vision of the enemy teamno vision in the relevant part of the map to do it safely.For me Ill usually split if my team can hold the enemy team at a turret on our side of the map without it being risky and I love to split vs someone who would provide more for their team than me in a team fight someone like Malphite for example who have team fight winning ultimates and forcing them to let me get turrets  losing their team the overall v v cause neither of us are there but hed do more if we were both there.Farm until youre relevant if you can tank their damage for very long you wont be able to do much in a teamfight anyways and might as well trade map pressure for getting some farm. This is mostly more relevant if youre behind already. Ideally you can get some farm in while split pushing but you have to use E to push the wave to be a bigger threat to the enemy team.Ideal? Well ideally Im vs an ad in lane so lets say someone like FioraDariusRenekton etc.Iceborn gt Tabi gt Spirit gt ZzrotSteraks gt DeadmansCan build zzrot and steraks in any order depending on if you need to counter burst right away or not.His build is fine but I have a different preference than him.I personally dont like Guardian angel most of the time since unless you go in and bait a lot of ultswhatever in a teamfight youre probably dead as soon as you come up anyways. Its a really expensive item for not a lot if the revive isnt game changing Ill build it to tp back door though since the revive lets me finish games for sure.,nasusmains,d0f6jbq,1,t5_34nmy

7805869,0,t3_4m8hw5,I think Illaoi is an easy matchup for sure. Jax can be scary as he scales just as well but his kill pressure on you during laning is moderately low. Same can be said for Irelia. My worst matchups are probably Darius and Olaf. Worst part is how common I see Darius too. I struggle with him so hard without jungle help. Teemo and Quinn are bad but I find its only a matter of time until I can beat them. For pantheon I run a ton of armor in runes and with lifesteal you can weather his early game without too much trouble as long as you play carefully. Ive seen a ton of matchups top lane so if theres any youre curious about feel free to ask and Ill give you my opinion on them. ,nasusmains,d3tfwp0,1,t5_34nmy
8466693,0,t3_4vm1yd,Perhaps if you subbed a summoner for Ghost TriHeart could work but its really damn expensive for what you get.  IBG gives you that extra sticking power for  less CDR but the tradeoff is the extra utility in the slow field.  Once you can afford it I would recommend getting the scaling CDR runes as thatll get you the  youre missing.Overall I dont like updated TriForce on the dawg since he doesnt benefit as much from the changed stats the rare crit Chance was pretty nice but now its mostly AS based which he doesnt really use much which is another reason why I suggested IBG over it.  Now if you wanted to do a cheesy autoattack based build then TF could work but your results may vary and Id suggest against the build in ranked.  Lol,nasusmains,d5zvi34,2,t5_34nmy

9300417,0,t1_d8uvh14,Yeah Im not sure if you watch much professional play but thats what happens when theres a random lane swap.One option you can take is not bother with staying to secure dragon your jungler adc and support should be capable of getting that safely and your mid laner on hand if need be. You need to back and go back to top lane and collect the wave which will be crashing into your inner turret.Alternatively you can let your ADC and Support go back and let them go to top lane and let them start pushing that outer turret. You need your jungler to help them because theyll be in a long lane and easy to gank but with your jungler there they can dive their bot lane there and take that tower too.In the meantime you can farm a jungle camp and prepare some vision for yourself whilst the wave pushes back to you. The enemy might collpase on you at your inner bot tower because theyll want that too so be prepared to give it up and ensure you dont die then you can collect the farm afterwards and likely the same will happen on the opposite side of the map with your team taking the tower too.,nasusmains,d8uw847,1,t5_34nmy
9318237,0,t3_583kyi,It will force people to go for more hp and I like that. Ive been doing iceborn and zzrot. No hp. Might start stacking a bit more of hp since resists are free. You can even run grasp for more effectiveness,nasusmains,d8x5kt9,1,t5_34nmy

9716592,0,t1_daaiiwu,Well I was thinking that since Ekko is so oppressive to Susan you should be playing super safe. Like edgeofminiondeathexperiencerange kind of safe. That way he wont be able to harass you since you are so close to your tower. Build straight MR and dont even try to go in unless your jungururu ganks. If that doesnt work then you can always ban Ekko during draft or ask for an Ekko ban. There really isnt much you can do against an Ekko however you could have more farm with the Quasus build.Cheers for quitting the bitching.Edit Added the Quasus sentence,nasusmains,daas499,2,t5_34nmy
9721674,0,t1_daasrg8,gtSinged still offers insane peel in midgame fights when played correctly and can do consistent damage to  people at onceTo  idiots at once. He can peel and damage IF people are stupid enough to let him. There is no outplay for a wither on the adc however and doge either is dealt with or starts killing carries.gtSinged can decide to win lane if he wants instead of blindly pushing. Assuming the Nasus pushes blindly. You know your opponent has no argument when he relies on the assumption that everyone else is stupid.gt are almost correct except most of the toplane champions that can waveclear as well or better than Singed GP Ryze suffer a weak early phaseAnd Spirit Susan cannot exploit weak early games no...oh wait...yes he can. And other than with singed who relies on enemy stupidity to be able to do so Susan can harass at will because there is no outplay for a spirit fire spawned under your feet.Oh I also done need ignite to do that.gtTake ignite all in and then proxy them for as long as he wants due to how behind he isAny argument that relies on your opponent being behind is crap.A champion has to work from behind as well as from being ahead.,nasusmains,dabepkg,2,t5_34nmy

11175238,0,t1_deyjya1,Ghost got nerfed that it needs two seconds now to reach the full speed boost. IMO a bullshit change for melees becuase they wanted to kill the Ghost  Flash combo used by mid champions.They should just give that rampup time for ranged champs.,nasusmains,deyp8iy,3,t5_34nmy
11260012,0,t1_df8afvl,You are most likely right that Warlords will no longer be viable after the patch. Which is really unfortunate as it stagnates choice for Fighters like Nasus.

11428716,0,t3_62w6rh,NASUS because his name is related to Nasus from latin which means nose so the latin pronounciation is the correct one.Naysus and Susan will just cause me to blow you to infinity.Nasus worst best in low damage environments because he can stack up tankiness as well and gets free damage while farming. Also there are lots of matchups he wins once he reached the point of outscaling. Alone yesterday I played against a veigar top who farmed better early game and could harass me but once I stacked enough damage I just ran him down with Ghost  Wither.,nasusmains,dfrfle7,1,t5_34nmy
