5914776,0,t3_3wbalw,I have played PaD for two years now. It is definitely hard not to make comparisons and see areas for improvement. Removing retreat is brutal for me in Galactic War.  I am sure to not get as far for a while now but it was an easy to exploit mechanic so I get the change.The biggest way I wish SWGoH was like pad was in the friends list. The way allies are organized leaves much to be desired. No way to know what leads a person may have available besides the one shown in friend list. Also allies have no way to be sorted like by power alliance type etc. Hard to know which allies are keepers and which ones have become inactive and need to be ditched.Besides that all I can say is I am glad I am not near the end game nor putting money in to rush the process. Pay to win faster also means getting bored faster for me personally. Thanks for sharing all your thoughts though.

Galactic War is actually my favourite mode in the game and Ive enjoyed beating it  out of  attempts so far I must admit one or two of those were pretty shaky victories in the final battle  I think Ewok Scout was used as fodder at one point!. Despite those victories Id still like to get better and continue levelling across my roster whilst maintaining my top  PVP rank so I can continue receiving the  arena tokens.  Re characters and levelling Im  shards away from  Fives and  away from  Phasma. Beyond that Im undecided on where to spend all the tokens etc.  I think Ill have a look at Ahsoka and Ventress as my next investments.

6085003,0,t3_3yuuno,I know it is selfevident but for me the most important thing I hope for is bug fixing and balancing. It just feels bad if you farm one month only to see that the character you got doesnt work as intended or is just useless trash compared to the best characters even if you form a team that suits for him. The game has some arguable gameplay decisions like making defensive charcaters almost useless at high levels because dispels arent useable when characters like Old Ben can ability block the whole team.I would like to have real time pvp but besides the technical issues I think it is not the time for that the next months. It would be a awesome to have this around autumn  when people have a large amount of characters and characters would be a bit better balanced so not everybody would be forced to use similar teams  like now almost all focus on crits and early damage.Right now allies are almost worthless I would like to write and interact with players but I am not sure if this alone would be a good idea. People might try to abuse this in arena. But anyway I want to have it too and I would really like to have a guild system. Without changing too much it should be possible to create something like a guild arena where members can offer characters to create teams the individual users can use to battle for guild points awards for all members.I am not sure about guaranteed shards in hard mode. Right now I think we have a drop rate of around  an increase to  would make it worth to grind this way and would be still fit to the general rng focus for any farming.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,cyh829v,1,t5_39umt

Here are some tips.  Use the retreat trick after anyone dies to get rid of annoying debuffs or to save an important character that is low on health that you cant heal..  I have found that playing your A team most of the time works best it doesnt need to have massive DPS but it helps a lot to have healing I run Barris Luminara JC Sidious Dooku.  You pick them off one by one by the end you are trying to kill as slowly as possible to heal up your guys and to undo cooldown timers..  When starting a match where you are completely outlevelled put  level  guys or I put one high level garbage guy with  level  guy to take the brunt of their big AOEabilities AI generally blows everything as soon as it can.  Then come in with your A team when this team gets wiped.  I have enough chars to do this  times but obviously you need to think ahead on what can be sacrificed.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,cyka4hc,2,t5_39umt

6114924,0,t1_cykp285,In your opinion. They serve very different roles. Phasma leads an assist comp buffing allies and slowing enemies. Poe boosts offense by a LOT soaks up damage with his taunt that also debuffs enemies taking bonus  of their HP off the next time theyre hit and is almost completely immune to negative status effects while also healing himself every time he resists one.Just because Phasma is cooler or more popular mainly fits more easily into most peoples existing teams that doesnt mean shes better.

Focus on Geonosian OR Luke in Cantinas Luminara in GW Sid or  although hes not as strong without other droids in Arena and Poe in Cantina shipments. You could also do Daka in Cantina shipments but Poe is much much better than Chewie. Those are all farmable but you really have to pick a comp and stick with it almost exclusively to succeed.Poe is fast and will usually get his taunt off early in the fight before youve lost a lot. Focus Sid or other annoying damage first ignore dooku until later in the fight. Hell usually start off with his stun ability then hes laughable until it refreshes.

I cant use the team Im thinking about vs the rank  and  on my ladder just because theyre using it the way I want to but have stronger stars on it. Im trying to see if theres a team I can make that can counter his so its more or less determining if QuiGon Jinn is viable or not.His health at  stars is of little relevance since they can take down nearly K health before I get to move when theyre on defense. Also being in top  you need a team that can both defend well and attack well preferably with the same team.

6279996,0,t1_cz31rio,Have you really played her? I mean against decent arena teams? I guess not you wouldnt write something like that if you had wasted resources for a NS team. Yes you can argue that it is good that she is slow because you can remove taunt and stuff in her first round. But on the the other hand with the same logic it would be even better if she were the fastest then she would attack first round and still remove taunt or whatever after the first round. Not every team uses a taunt and if you think about Poe he runs first often so your whole team attacks him first round until you have a chance to remove the taunt. At this point you dont even want this because if you had a strong team you would just try to kill him and not waste a turn for a try that fails more often than not.The problem with the speed is that she is way too weak for her speed. And being slow doesnt mean that she has to be  slower than average and  slower than a lot of fast characters. Even if you remove a taunt and some other buffs early on you suffer from the low speed the whole battle. Since every other character has a lot higher speed the others are off cooldown way earlier. E.g. Poggle buffs almost  times until Asajj is off cooldown. And every ability you do with her that doesnt deal damage hurts your team a lot. Not even to mention that that she can get ability blockedstunned so it takes ages until she does anything. And did I mention that she has low health? Because of her low speed it takes ages to get rid of heal immunity. Asajj is just useless in theory she is powerful but you have to be rediculously lucky to use her abilities as intended. It might happen every  games the other  she is just a burden and you are better of with almost every other character.

IG is great to tag in against Jedi teams but given those have been practically wiped out after the antiJedi buffs he doesnt do a lot of good.  Hes a tank with no taunt that nobody cares about targeting because hes not a threat.  Sid will give healbased oppositions an extra priority target to consider which is a huge plus.Of course IG is nice to have in your back pocket in case the meta shifts for any reason back toward Jedi teams.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,cz3qnvl,1,t5_39umt

6362254,0,t3_42ijg4,Hi all I would like some advice on which characters I should focus on starring up or unlocking first. Im level  FP currently running this team  Phasma L  Sidious  Lumi  GS and  Daka. All of them are gear  purple and level .Im on a relatively new server started playing Jan rd and in the arena I usually hover around the  range though today I managed to hold  long enough to get the  prize. I have had very few problems clearing Galactic War Ive beaten it every day for the past  days though I have noticed that it has gotten a bit harder recently.Im pretty happy with my teams performance so far. However I have reached the point where I have several choices to make regarding the characters I am going to be farming. I thought it would be best to consult this thread as I dont want to go down the wrong path. Here are my dilemmas Focus GW tokens on Phasma or Lumi first? After I got Phasma and Lumi to  each I decided that I would focus on getting Lumi to  from then on and only afterwards would I star up Phasma further because I feel like most of Phasmas utility comes from her abilities rather than her stats or raw damage. Is this the best thing to do or would it be better to alternate starring them up or even focus on Phasma instead? I literally just got Lumi to  today so I havent invested any currency on getting her shards towards  so now is a good time to ask. Focus on Geonosian Soldier or Kylo Ren in Cantina Battles? I have unlocked the Kylo Ren Cantina battle and was initially very tempted to start grinding out Kylo. He seems like a very good character plus hell have twice the chance of proccing a bonus attack with Phasmas leader ability. However I have been very happy with GS so far and hes almost   shards. Also I am worried about spreading myself too thin in terms of character investment. I have really noticed a big difference in my squads power after getting my Sidious and Lumi to  and I feel that grinding out Kylo would put me on the back foot in terms of stars relative to the top arena players. Currently Im thinking that I should get GS to  first and then eventually start grinding out Kylo afterwards would you agree with this? Focus Cantina tokens on Old Daka or Poe? I have been increasingly seeing the highest ranking teams on my server using Poe and the impression I get from this subreddit is that he is among the very best characters in the game right now. I am considering grinding him out to put on my team however like my reservations about grinding Kylo I am worried that this will put me on the back foot in terms of starring up my characters. Theres also the possibility that he will get nerfed in the next patch. Currently I am investing no currency into buying Daka shards until I make a decision on this my Dakas still  shards towards  star and I have .k Cantina credits saved up. Would it be worth switching from Daka to Poe? My other concern is that Poe seems best suited to extreme damage squads like droidLeiaFOTPetc. teams so Im not sure how well he would fit into my team. Daka on the other hand fits into my team very well due to her stuns proccing off Phasmas leader ability. Is Poe good enough to justify the switch? Or should I stick with Daka? Or perhaps even just keep saving Cantina tokens until the next patch?That said Im thinking about dumping her or Luminara eventually not soon since two healers seems pretty unnecessary once you get into the higher levels with high damagespeed seemingly becoming increasingly more important than tankinessheals. Kylo Ren will probably take one of their places once I start farming him.Sorry for how long that post turned out I wanted to make sure I got all my concerns out there. If you even read this far then thanks and any advice would be appreciated ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,czctg42,3,t5_39umt

6379132,0,t3_430szg,Games like this have three general parts that can be updated Client Code Server Code and Data.Client code is the hardest and slowest to change because it has to go through app store approval and the user has to download an update. This is where things like AI targeting game mechanics UI screens and complicated implementation bugs like Debuff removal failing to remove heal immunity most likely lay.Server code is easier to change because they can change it on their end and players will see the difference right away. Unless its support for a feature that also requires client changes they can fix issues here pretty much at will. Anything related to resource spending or gains or mission rewards or matchmaking algorithms are most likely here. But the more impactful gameplay bugs wont be here.Data controls numeric values and what players can see where and most text. This is pretty easy for them to change technically because they just need to deploy some files to a server that the game retrieves whenever it starts up. These changes often have the most to do with the content and balance of the game. Things like a characters stat growth the new damage value from an ability increase or Dookus bonus attack rate the magnitude of a heal the description of a character what is available for sale in what store and for how much are the sort of things that are controlled by data.Changing a spreadsheet to add QuiGon Jinn to a store or changing the value of Dooku Ability  Level  Bonus Effect chance from . to . are very simple and importantly very safe. Fixing a logical error in some implementation is much harder because it requires more investigation testing and probably a harder process to deploy the fix. Some things that are definitely broken in data like FOTPs stats at  Stars could technically be fixed just as eaily but Im guessing theyre hesitant to do that because of the greater balance implications and potential for OMG give me a refund complaints. Im willing to bet that the following happened this week The devs were planning on adding QuiGon Jinn to the store which was going to require a data deploy. They also noticed people were reporting broken bonus attacks for Dooku bad rewards from the keycard battle and incorrect text for Expose. They did some quick investigation and yup they simply had the wrong data in the spreadsheet. So they fixed it and since they were redeploying data for QGJ anyways they threw those changes in to the same update. But then after announcing those changes they realized that the keycard battle changes were also dependent on the server the rewards were defined in the data but the server is what controls the actual response and needed to be updated to read the new data just like our clients needed to refetch the data. So even though the clients had the fixed data for that piece the server where the data mattered wouldnt be updated until Thursday when they had a server code update planned.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,czeqlqy,4,t5_39umt

If they wanted to discourage hoarding theres a simple way to do that put in options that people want to buy. Failing that they could have increased the refresh cost to  tokens or something. But they didnt they changed it to crystals. To try to make money.And they didnt announce it in advance so nobody could use up their hoards before this stupid change was made.Yes they care so terribly much about the integrity of the game that they dont want people to go from  to  quickly. Unless you give them  of course then they are pleased as punch for you to do so.Greed.Please dont tell me that trying to force me to spend resources on characters that are underpowered and uninteresting to me is the most fun for me.

6400410,0,t1_czgv7nf,it was changed to be a  chance drop of at least  full character in an pack draw. However that is probably weighted towards the common characters so you may still get  shard packs after the full character is then converted to something you have.

6404202,0,t1_czh8o8m,gt e is brilliant at speeding up droid teams by allowing them to start each turn with their turn meter already significantly filled and his aoe helps prevent the opposing team from using explosive specials in tSeconded. RUN POE. End of story. Poe is the sole character that has allowed my k droid team snipe a k power guy  levels higher than me due to lucky exposes and going first allowing your whole team to move first and pick off at least one enemy.Oh without Poe if you try going to against teams that are k power higher than you be prepared to INSTA LOSE many fight where ur IG  or  gets sniped off before you even get to move. I faced that  matches in a row where my driods were dying before I even got my first turn and that was when my Poe did not have his full speed gear yet. So Poe is the lifeblood of the team for sure.HK or Poggle are the only ones that can be cut but HK is probably the better choice IMO. Ive been noticing that HK just doesnt cut it and could use Geno.S as another damage or maybe QGJ now. Since my droid team is also my GW team you can sometimes run someone like lumi lead for defensiveness and realize that your droid team works almost just as well as with HK. Sure you wont have IG  aoe  take another turn dream but what I often observe especially going up against teams that are WAY higher power level than you if that after your IG does his aoe when enemy lumi eventually gets her turn everyone else you hit is going to get healed back up to full. After all droid team isnt about dealing massive AoE its focus is on IG  big single target crits and focusing down key enemies such as ReyFOTPLeia and such. Having Geno.S or QGJ works very well with that idea in mind and although the  turn meter bonus will be missed I somehow think that Geno firing off an extra bonus attack to help provide another  shot KO option is great. Leveling up my Geno still so will be testing him once he gets to a reasonable .,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,czhlcdh,3,t5_39umt

6427956,0,t3_43pm5p,This has been pretty well established on this sub  the rolls are predetermined in some way before you even start the GW match. You can play through it x over and it will go exactly the same way if you make the same choices  all abilities used by AI all buffsdebuffs all RNG will go the same way.The only starting variable is actually which enemy hero you have selected before their leader buff is applied. This applies to the speedtie roll and to applied buffsdebuffs from the first round of abilities e.g.  Poes Expose Taunt Sidious heal bebuff Dookus stun. In fact often times if you select a different hero before leader buff the AI will attack a different hero first or use a different ability from the start. So if the first round doesnt go how you like it retreat then as you load again spam click on a different hero than last time and the first actions will happen differently. You have  different possible starts  enemy selections. Then each different decision you make from there will create a new somehow predetermined path that would repeat should you do it again.

6473267,0,t1_czou75y,It seems like you are raising  different GW questions. Who to use your GW currency on and who to use in GW. To your first question who to spend GW currency on  I would recommend Poggle. He has decent speed to get off his offense up early and can fit in many different team and will be critical to your planned droid team. I was in the same spot as you  star Lumi and Phasma and Poggle was an easy pick for my rd character to focus on.To your second question who to use in GW  most of the characters you have left to pick from with GW currency will not make a good wellrounded GW team  so like I said focus Poggle knowing you will not use him much for GW. I run almost the exactly same GW team make up to you with  Dooku  Lumi  Sid  JC with  Bariss as my leader. Vader is far to slow in my opinion and is basically stuck at  stars for the foreseeable future. I strongly recommend the  healer GW team. Be it a well starred Daka Ewok elder or best yet bariss. If you can farm Bariss in cantina do it she gets around the annoying healing immunities like a champ and she treats me great even at  stars. I am nearing  and keep my Arena rank below  and this team is able to take me thru all the GW matches each day with only a few retreats.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,czovqqd,1,t5_39umt

6475669,0,t1_czp32sm,I think they will because they did. Poe only ascended into Godlike tier as of like a month ago. Before then people thought he sucked. People were complaining they were stuck with him when others had phasma.  Prepoe no one used taunters either there was no wall to hide behind first turn. And teams were still essentially just DPS. Some combination of  geo sid leia fotp luke Boba phasma and QGJ usually with Lumi as well because no one else looked worthwhile in GW. The meta was the same poe just hadnt exposed it yet. Now its problems are exposed and most people not you obv are throwing all the blame on him when fixing him wont change shit about the meta. Edit as far as the nerf to him is concerned there are definitely ways to nerf him without killing him. Splitting up the taunt turn meter and expose into two moves would be a start. But thats not the nerf I hear called for over and over. Thay nerf is remove the turn meter manipulation and slow him down. That will nerf him into bolivia.

6478358,0,t3_44cpg2,This is my own idea of how potency and tenacity works I dont really have any way of proving it it just makes the most sense to me lolI believe potency and tenacity is calculated through  dice rolls. First dice roll  This is the chance of the negative effect happening.Lets look at Sidious. He has  potency but  chance of the negative effect happening. In the end its still  chance of the negative effect dice roll happening.Now lets look at Dooku. He has  potency. His stun has a  chance of hitting on nonJedis. I think the potency is applied multiplicatively onto the skills chance of the negative effect so    is  chance of the stun happening. If the target is a Jedi itll be    which is  chance of the stun hitting. Ridiculous right? But heres the catch.Second dice roll  This is the chance of the negative effect being resisted. This is where tenacity comes in. By whatever amount the tenacity is that will strictly be the chance that any negative effect is resisted. It doesnt matter if the actual potencyapplied chance is  or  like Dooku or even  chance of hitting Luminara has  tenacity and she will always have a  chance of Dookus stun and a  chance of resisting Sidiouss healing immunity.tldr  Dice roll  is the chance of negative status effect happening with potency calculated into it multiplicativelyDice roll  is the chance of negative status effect being resisted which is purely tenacityFor a negative status to actually hit the target you have to win both dice rolls. As long as someone has tenacity he will always have a chance to resist.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,czper3x,2,t5_39umt

Farmable characters are those that are available in the shipments of Cantina Battles Galactic War or Arena Battles game modes that reward a second currency or are in Cantina battles which you can keep fighting until you run out of energy.  Limited Farmable characters are those that are only available through shards in Hard Mode Story Missions light and dark sideyou can only play each mission  times without spending crystals so you have a limited opportunity to farm them.  The last class are Heroes whose shards are only available from packs.  Darth Maul is currently in the last class so you wont be able to easily raise his star rank.   Hell be good early on as a powerful attacker but late game he may be outclassed.

6540468,0,t3_457a0f,Interesting suggestion it might work.  However it seems to be that the bulk of the currently OP fast  hard hitters are AGIbased toons so using that same stat as the basis for a fix seems likely to continue to perpetuate their dominance.Alternatively the devs could just tone down the damage multipliers that seem to be present for nearly all attacks.  The physical and special damage values in a characters stats screen seems to have little direct bearing on the actual damage done by said character it all seems to be affected by a multiplier that is different for each character.  I.e. my IG has about  physical damage stat and basic hits for around k.  My GS has  dmg and hits for .  My Poe has  dmg and hits for .  If all multipliers were kept between  and maybe . or so instead of  or higher for some high dps toons the dmg to health ratios would be a lot better I think.

6587883,0,t1_d00eoqx,Full credit to you for farming Asajj and Savage in Arena rather than Sidious!  Im a firm fan of Asajj and Im convinced that shell be a force to be reckoned with one day but despite the buff that Savage got in the update Im not sure hell ever cut it  whereas Sidious is a good allround character and will probably serve you better than Savage overall. Id get Asajj to  as youre clearly quite close then move back to Sidious and star him up more.  Also if I faced your team in Arena Id feel confident that Talia and Savage are not threats in terms of damage and I wouldnt worry about targetting either and on top of that Asajj is slow so I wouldnt be too concerned by her making an impact against me either. Just so you know my team is Phasma l Luminara Kylo Sidious and Fives. Im not talking about if my team at level  faced yours but if we were the same level etc..  Its just a game so do what you want re building teams using favourite characters etc. but if you want my advice Id recommend focussing on QGJ in Cantina Shipments Luminara in GW Shipments and in LSDS missions and Cantina Id go for JC just to help you through GW.

6712715,0,t1_d0dn8el,Obviously  is going to be when he shines but he is a good character despite what people say. I have him fully maxed out except for  piece of gear  purple handcuffs that give him  physical damage.  His speed paired with QGJ L is phenomenal outpaced only by Dooku or Yoda with GQL L since his speed is the same as QGJ at .  He doesnt hit for that much to start off with but the reason he shines is because  he has a buff immunity debuff that stops opposing tanks from Taunting if it lands or Leia from going stealth. In addition he can give a team wide Offense Up buff when he gets a finish blow with Smite which happens more often than people think. With k health people either need to focus him down early so he doesnt make them pay or they need to risk killing one of his teammates and face Anakin again this time with offense up. With the right team composition his speed health and unique passive Righteous Fury make him a great addition when running QGJ as your leader.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d0dnht1,1,t5_39umt

But I also wouldnt necessarily mistake the silence for happiness in match making either just as I wouldnt assume they are angry.This sub is a small fraction of the player base and its a safer statement to say that the large majority of people who play games like this dont read forums or subreddits. They play it and thats all. They go into their GW see their matchup in round  and realize they cant win and quit for the day or maybe longer depending how discouraged they get.And even still we have people who claim they have no issue clearing their GW yet many in the same breath will talk about exiting the game and trying again to get things to play out differently. I bet the percentage of people who clear their GW daily that dont use that little trick is small fraction as well.However even if you feel the GW are running properly they have already stated thats it is not.

She is still quite squishy make sure you have someone else who can hit a bit harder. Why are you bringing two healers? Bring one at most and make that your Lumi since she at least hits hard. Take her out FAST. The longer she survives the harder she hits. She hits hard at the start but she destroys if you let her live. If you believe there is some higher priority target just make sure to DEBUFF her. With ANYTHING. She will immediately hit for much less. Did I mention debuffs make her hit for a lot less.

6723540,0,t1_d0erbeb,Well thats easy. I struggled with GW for the longest time and am now able to better get a handle on it which has slowed down my ability to level Lumi a bit. Once I got into GW I had to refocus my strategy and switched from farming Luke with Cantina Shards to JC so I could get a second healer to make it easier on me. With Fives I made a stupid mistake on and chose to get Boba Fett out of vanity instead of spending the Cantina Credits on Fives and get him up more. Dooku... well it just takes forever to farm when you dont have his Cantina Battle open and Im doing this all FP. Im Rank  in Arena so Im pulling  Arena Credits a day between Rank and Daily. Much of my arena ranking I own up to not having been smart at the start with how I was going to plan my characters.

I always have a harder time in my matches when Leia doesnt hit her crit chance up on the first turn so maybe without her Poggle is necessary. Phasma on the other hand I havent tested. The extra turn meter manipulation sounds pretty nice. For a support character she can hit relatively hard and is pretty tanky. She does have the same problem that Poggle has though that with both AAHan and Leia in my case she doesnt deal a lot of damage in the first turn but maybe the turn meter is enough.  I think Im going to work on her and try her out for a bit I can definitely see her working very very well in this team even though she would be the slowest of the bunch.

You will have to constantly play around with your team to keep it there but dont get greedy.  In the meantime keep working on leveling A and B teams for GW.  Unlock and work on plenty of healers and just forget about competing in Arena.  Its all about clearing GW everyday.Im  my Arena threshold is k squad power.  I dont care about the rewards or my rank and it just makes the Arena tokens farm slower.  I could use a k squad but I dont ever.

6956119,0,t3_4az6wb,Pretty accurate summary.I dont know if those changes are enough to make him viable though. His damage is still going to be the lowest of the droids and theres no reason to take him out early since his leader is most of the characters value.  Hes obviously more of a support character but his basic and passive dont fit with that. Supports are better off with a basic that has a utility secondary effect like Poggle or Daka. The passive is much worse like Maces before the rework. I dont know why so many tanky characters have selfrevives or other abilities that activate on death but nothing that would make you wantneed to focus them early.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d14t5v2,2,t5_39umt

I like the idea of if I go allin on a character and find out hes not good that I will then try to find ways to fit him into a comp and still remain at a high level.

6975470,0,t3_4b8b81,Farming from Hard nodes is the slowest FP farming in the game.  If a character has a Cantina and a Hard mode you ideally want to farm both but you can skip the Hard mode if you need the energy for gear or other shards ReyFOTPRG etc.  Higher level nodes give more credits and a higher chance of level  ability mats so they are preferred.    Think of it this way at lowerlevels you needed a way to farm JC so they gave you hard modes in LSDS.  Then you needed more shards so now you unlocked Cantina level .  Eventually you are even higher level and want to farm JC but the rewards on level  arent so good anymore... enter Cantina level !

QGJ is much better because he contributes an assist potential taunt removal offense up speed up every fight.  Super strong at GW and probably feasible even at .Sid is OK but falls off later.  He might be fine for .  GS is another very strong character currently on your B team.It takes a lot of trial and error but I usually got through it only using my A team.  If you dont finish a fight with characters near full health and no more than  skills on cooldowns start over.Also  Lumi with GW shipments.  She is way too good not to.

Moreover there may have been people who crafted Mk Arakyd Droid Callers before the update notes were even posted waiting to see how the meta shakes out before equipping.  The developers arent going to want two different pieces of equipment with the same name in the game so the logical result is that existing Mk Arakyd Droid Callers will be updated to have the stats that result from the new recipe.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d1ktq9x,1,t5_39umt

When the nd effect occurscheck for buffs Savage now has buffs which QGJ then debufs and then applys the offence buff to all allies.In both cases the damage is applied first then the debuf effect happens.

If you use Barriss or Lumi lead you will definitely have matches that you wish would last a bit longer to get CDs back up proc more heals or get one more heal off before the next match.

As a developer each character should be looked at and changed then.Obviously with the decimal in percentages and things like buffing grievous who is . pp and . small sample pool to use it was clear that a formula was put in place for a lot of these changes.What they overlooked were things like Mace who is already in a bad spot but stat wise probably looked good on paper That or say Kylo Ren is was OKAY viable and now does pitiful damage AND is slow.

7275174,0,t3_4f1g3q,. From Arena Definitely not Sid his era has ended for now from major danger he got degraded to annoyance. ST Han is way more useful with protection than he was before hes still only for arena though. Savage seems to be best choice for PvE right now hes very solid without any gamechanging quirk but also without any major disadvantage. So i would say SavagegtHangtHK?EDIT About Han i tried him in the GW today and he is useful there too some fight take so long now that his taunt can finish cooldown in single fight now.. From GW Still LumigtPhasmagtPoggle. Lumi got a little less useful with protection but will gain some with Omega skills so overall shes still nobrainer. Phasma got stronger and will gain much with Omega skills. Very solid choice even without any other FO. Poggle is Poggle still doing what hes done before. Also i got some info that IG got significantly better but i cant confirm nor disprove that.. From Cantina Idk GS still seems strong for later i would strongly recommend Barriss for LS and GW also JC will get better with Omega skills. Dooku is still going very strong and we ofc get RG on  lvl.. From cantina shipments I dont agree QGJ got much worse. Speed is still very viable his damage havent gone down much and his worst point survivability increased. He just cant oneshot anyone with Harmonious Assault but then again practically no one can oneshot now Also he will gain even more utility with Omega skills. Daka will be stunmachine with Omega skill but still weak otherwise. Fives is strong now. I would say QGJgtFivesgtDaka,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d254zwc,13,t5_39umt

7277588,0,t3_4f1pwj,My take on it is.  If you where having issues with GW before ur pretty fed now.  But if you where able to breeze through it then you will be fine.The key for me even before the update was to find a team that was stable all the way through.  That meant I could go into each fight with all my cool downs up and at least  health and leave the fight in about the same shape.  With the update its actually just become easier if not a little slower because there are twice as many rounds in a fight.  That means twice as much time doing basic attack on the last  scrubs on the opposing side while everyone regens their cooldowns.For me the best team i have found for this is BarrisL Lumi Qgj Gs and .  All maxed out lvl no pre crafting.  Sure my protection is out by the rd node but there has pretty much been a damage reduction across the board so my sustainable team got that much more sustainable.  There are a few times I just cant keep up and may loose  in the last fight or .  But Ive got enough characters Stard and geared that if that happens Ill just retreat throw in my lowest decent squad and take out  of theirs and move on.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d25evww,3,t5_39umt

7278377,0,t1_d25gt1v,Id have to disagree on RG not outperforming Han.  I have a maxed out Han and a  RG and the RG outperforms Han in every instance in highlevel arena.  Han is great if you are facing a team that does not have a ton of damage dealers in it.  Even with protection It does not take much to take him out.  His job is to die and give you meter but you need him to die slowly to get a net positive out of him and that does not happen against attackers like Rey  Geo etc even with the damage adjustments I am sorry to say.  That is not just my opinion my guild has experimented and this is our general conclusion now.  My ladder seems to stay on top of changes and Dooku most certainly has not lost his edge.  Those evades are valuable.  The offense up does not mean much now or then.  The fact that matches last longer means that there are more evades.  When we hit level  and QGJ became faster than Dooku most of my ladder switched to QGJ.  Yesterday they switched back to Dooku.  I like his stun.  It makes GW easier.  It makes sense with his cattle prod of a weapon.  It is the taunt that makes him valuable in arena.  That G makes a difference sure.  BUT that also shows that his strength levels are not linear to the damage increases between here and  G as well.  He will have  points you have to knock off at that point.  Compare that to the  you just pointed out.  ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d25i43z,2,t5_39umt

It is difficult though due to variance in damage and not knowing the hard stats of enemies that Im facing in challenges etc. What I can say is that yes there does appear to be a difference in defense from last patch to now but it is not major. For example my numbers are showing an increase of  damage reduction with the addition of Hans  DEF leader ability. It does vary based on the armor of the target though. DEF UP boosts seem to be slightly better than previous. With a combo of a DEF Leader ability and a DEF UP effect Ive seen damage reduction in the neighbourhood of between  at times.

If were talking about the same Ewok video they were attacking the Gamorrean Boss not the Rancor. Back to tenacity he has abilities that get reduced when he has debuffs on him.

7498929,0,t3_4i2yzu,GreetingsHere are the second set of update notes for today. Please note that these updates ONLY apply to Android users for now. This update can manually be obtained from the Google Play store. The game team is still working to get this update released for iOS devices.New Updates Chat in combat all game modes  players are now able to chat across all game modes with their Guild mates while in combat. The Achievements button has been moved from the Settings menu to the ingame Achievements menu.Bug Fixes The Raid prebattle screen will now only show characters that are eligible to bring into the battle.Commas have been added to Damage done in Raid leaderboards. The last chat message is now always displayed at the bottom of the players screen until the chat window has been opened. This allows a player to more easily tell when a Guild member has posted a message. All leader abilities now properly activate in Raids after the first attempt. Reverse lookup now works properly when pointing to character shards that appear in the Shard Shop. Players will now receive a message that they must be in a Guild when using reverse lookup for items in the Guild Store if they arent already in a Guild. The Door Control Panel in The Pit Raid can no longer dodge attacks. Fixed a bug that would sometimes cause a crash when crafting Gear. The Door Control Panel in The Pit Raid will now have its Turn Meter persist between attempts. The Protection meter on characters will now regenerate slightly in between phases of The Pit Raid as long as the character has at least a small percentage of their Protection remaining.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d2ul8e0,2,t5_39umt

I run Phasma L GQGJ  GDooku  GDaka  GBiggs  G First turn soon as phasma lands Fusilade or Def down or DookuDaka land a stun its basically game over. Savage hasnt killed anyone since using this setup  and the fights generally over in a few turns. I would say to swap out JC and Poggle. Poggle is only really useful here for the Ability Block on his basic. But if you have Daka swap her in she has stunheal so can replace both PoggleJC as just  toon.

While there might be different implementations to address them there really must be some improvement!On T while requiring a different set of characters for T as compared to T does disincentivize in developing any of the T toons beyond a certain level it encourages to develop other toons that might not have been as important in T which might be intended. However I agree that it would be much better if there was also strategy involved for T instead of just DPS. For example it could be that the rancor is more affected by certain debuffs for different tiersphases instead of just tenacity up i.e. make it like Savage in challanges but it only works for certain types of debuffs. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d38er96,1,t5_39umt

The game is like a living organism it needs to be worked on and maintained updated and fixed like all the time.

Most online games used to have a subscription fee around  bucks a month This game has a payment option for  bucks you get  crystals a day for  days. no risk of that getting you aheadI can see how it looks like cheating when some one drops a few thousand to  star and gear  Leia but paying a little to support a game you like and getting low rewards for your generosity seems a stretch from GodMode. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d3crfj5,1,t5_39umt

7660543,0,t1_d3cy1wb,If youll like look at the screenshots youll see six teams that are guaranteed to kill at least one of your characters.  When you have a RG with a g or g Rey behind it or a Leia that team is going to kill someone.  Which is ok but on the next node you have to replace that loss which means the next character is probably going to have worse gear and probably less abilities.  And as you get weaker the teams get stronger.The problem is theyre pulling arena teams into gw way too early.  Those should be on the last and second to last nodes.   Which is kind of what I saw today either through a tweak by CG or just happy RNG.  Todays was much less stressful and concluded in two hours instead of four.Given my arena power is over k there really arent many teams that have more.

7768843,0,t1_d3p8fod,I never said getting rid of protection was the solution Im just stating its far from balanced as it is. They need to give us a refresh or make it noticeably recover from node to node. The claim that my units gain health or protection between matches is pretty much mute Ive never seen any gain that makes a shred of difference. At this point I dont even understand the point of protection rather than just buffing health by a bit. Protection is a blow to the entire healing class as seen in GW healing squads vs arena teams and in Arena no one uses healers anyway because the entire game mode is based on single battle performance not sustainability. GW would be much more fair if we got a protection refresh before every purple node or if our units gained  max protection between each battle. The way it currently stands is worse than Arena in the speed meta my half health characters get flattened by heavy DPS before I can eliminate the threat plus enemy characters have a ton more health. Then we get into why heavy DPS teams are even in GW to begin with and we go full circle on the issues as a whole. You and I must treat GW differently you roll towards double heal health buff and evasion double lead and Im over here fantasizing about nuke damage city with Ani and QGJ. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d3p97a4,2,t5_39umt

I failed obviously But I can understand the mindset.GW is awesome and it could be considered a sport things that have a base level of what you can and cannot do the only advantages you have are natural born talent experience and skill.Lets use this as an example in CSGO one team did pixel walking and got an unfair advantage it was not in the rules to determine if that should be allowed or not. They then disallowed it and thus the problem ended. But if they had not and you were seriously committed to being the best however silly that is you would need to learn pixel walking in order to get back on even footing with those that use it.It really just comes down to i dont get why you care But there is no reason for attacking or disrespecting someone because their passions dont fit or are not inline with yours. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d410mbk,0,t5_39umt

Second of those  bought  in crystals for chromiums when they started playing before realizing you dont get anything for your money. Third of those  bought the  starter pack because he thought the game was cool and it would be a good investment to get cool characters. He was also educated on the poor money return and how little it actually helped. So out of my  members whove spent   and   of them spent it out of beginners naivety and the other bought it for charity and fan appreciation. None have given them any advantage and only one was recent enough to even matter. In conclusion you can say or believe what you want. As a whale I could care less what your opinion on FP is because you have no insight in the matter.

8064340,0,t3_4phyu3,I agree that there has to be a better to distribute raid rewards. I dont think that they necessarily need to increase the amount of credits coins or gear they are sending our way not that I would complain just please please please make it less random. Everyone seems to feel like they are usually getting gear that is not useful to them ATM or even worse completely useless. This seems like the most important thing they need to fix. Guild coins and curency are very important but the raid gear is the big  gate in this game. I dont remember who I saw suggest this but a simple fix would be to do away with gear in raid drops entirely and just give me more coins so i can buy what I really need out of the guild store. They could still drop fully crafted gear too or instead of fully crafted gear there could be random large coin drops.Simply asking for more credits more coins more gear isnt going to get us anywhere. We need to champion a creative solution that isnt going to hurt their pocketbook if we are going to get them to do anything about this.Also I know that youre probably not looking for raid advice with this post but to me that seems like the solution to your problem. Do better in raids get more rewards and then raids will be worth it to you. I would recommend a TM removal team with QGJ and Teebo.TLDR Do away with gear in raid drops entirely and just give me more coins so i can buy what I REALLY NEED out of the store.

Why? Because its too much work to manually edit player accounts because it would cost money in manhours and its too hard. Because theyd have to work on a client update or something that isnt directly generating revenue.And then the players whove spent thousands for faster progression paying EACG wages supporting the game get to look at players in their arena or guild who gained months of advantage for FREE.After the events of the last few months the solution to this had better be pretty spectacular.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d4pmm7v,6,t5_39umt

8108627,0,t3_4qaae5,I started using him as my Arena lead because I was sick of using Dooku and didnt want to just switch to Phasma or Han.  I have stayed pretty consistently high since I did this Teebo RG QGJ Daka Rey.  Im pretty sure this team is just super annoying to deal with because if you start in on someone probably Rey then she might just go invisible for a turn then you have to switch and if you get them down then RG will taunt.  If you kill them then Daka will rez.  On offence it has helped me not shy away from teams running Han and RG because I have QGJ and Teebos dispel.  The TM manipulation is a bit useful but mostly hes there for dispel  extra turnsinvis from leadership and thats been enough for me to keep him.In raiding though hes an absolute champ.  Teebo L QGJ Yoda Rey Phasma Ive been running on T and I can keep the Rancors TM low for a VERY long time with these guys.  It took me a while to entertain the thought of not using Phasma as lead in raid cuz she is obviously one of the best but Teebo is just that much better IMO.  Hes almost always invisible so he has a chance to almost fully drain the TM every chance he gets.  Phasma will have the Rancor slowed so the extra turns means he could get  tries to proc it which should be plenty.  Just a beast!,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d4rhdqk,3,t5_39umt

The main reason I quit and Ive cooled down alot since yesterday is that unfortunately with every patch the limits are stretched further and further.

8178114,0,t3_4rb5ag,The point of these events Focus on a single group of characters If you have them great! If no and thats very likely for most people they want you to rush and spend money to catch up and get those  EmpireDroid characters. Create no exceptions and make it so you need to meet the requirements or you will automatically lose.If you dont have them youre dead. Droids are Required and Empire units suck shit. RG is about the best thing because of his potency and whatnot  Vader is only really good at higher levels but because his shards are achievementbased his shards are a bit ridiculous to get. Tarkin is shit Veers... Troopers  Shitters Thats literally it for Empire troops. Not even joking Empire sucks literal shit. Vader is good but takes forever to actually star and the same goes for RG since theres only a few hard nodes to farm. Basically in order to actually complete this event as a FP you need mostly droid units and RG to complete.

8237591,0,t3_4s7zry,It depends on their Tanks and your comp except I wouldnt go for Leia first over other DPSers she will invis too quickly. If you have a very heavy dps team lots of dpsers I would go for Rey lots of people are needed because her foresight is likely to stop one of the attacks. FOTP is usually slow and easy to take out in almost all situations if you have a medium number of dpsers then go for him first otherwise after rey. QGJ is next followed by IG both of these guys can put out some damage not as much as Rey or FOTP though but are fairly low on hp QGJ more important though because of the dispel. Then I would kill GSLeia at this point Leias invis should wear off and then you can kill her GS is a little tankier then most of the dpsers so you should wait to take him out till after the weaker dpsers are dealt with.Also if they have rey and another DPSer and you are not all high dps chars you can attack the other DPSer and send your weakest attacker to blow the foresight on rey to prevent her damage boost.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d5796e4,1,t5_39umt

8314323,0,t1_d5gtina,Movie hints are often misdirection. While the simplest answer seems to point to Luke being the father in movie terms Han being Reys dad is the simplest. We have two movies left so one movie to tell Reys backstory one to finish the overall plot. So to think the next movie will have time to advance the plot tell Reys backstory introduce a new female character ie Lukes baby momma  remember we have to meet her learn her history find out where she went why she left Rey etc is kind of a stretch. Theres just not enough time in a . hour movie to tell all that. It just makes more movie sense to have Reys parents being HanLeia since they are already fleshed out. All thats left to tell is how HanLeia seemed to forget Rey and why they left her on Jaku. Ive always thought Han was Reys dad and this would also explain why Kylo is so connected to her.

I really like Cad as well hes an overtly direct reference to the fact that star wars was originally intended to be a space western. Well Boba is as well. In ESB they intentionally added spurs jangling as he walks. The cloak is a tribute to Clint Eastwood in the dollars trilogy and his blaster loss very similar to Lee Van Cleefs pistol with the stock in a few dollars more.Anyhow while Boba may not have been glorified in his on screen portrayal we can still easily infer his power through his social standing and reputation. Han knew first hand that the bounty hunter was not to be reckoned with and again the equipment failure has nothing to do with Bobas power or lack thereof. Perhaps Boba would have died at that battle if he were not sent into the pit the force works in mysterious ways.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d5s42jc,3,t5_39umt

8476021,0,t3_4vsi4l,Theres at least one galactic war complaint post every day.  I hate the set up as much as the next guy but figured out a way around it.  They calculate opponents based on your best arena team from what I gather  so if all you do is invest in your arena characters the GW is going to continue to get more and more difficult.  This is why having a viable B team is essential and make sure to give them love.  This means leveling gearing and modding them competitive to your arena team.  This may mean that the arena team struggles a bit more to compete but thats the trade off.I generally complete all my GWs except for one or two a month when I catch a really bad matchup i.e. droids on droids where the other team goes first.  I still stay competitive in Arena top  but its a struggle.This is all FP all my crystals earned in ArenaDailies go towards energy refreshes.  The gear exchange really helped w gearing my characters.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d611lxu,2,t5_39umt

8504319,0,t3_4w49xw,EDIT I didnt make this change so I went and checked and this text change has been in the game since the Mod update on July th so its been in the game for more than three weeks and it was included in the patch notes with explanation.To clarifywe realized the mistake in the wording only too late and came back and fixed it later. Tenacity Down has always functioned the way it currently says it doesminimum chance to Resistso the previous description was simply misleading.The reason we choose to phrase it this way is twofold first the  minimum Resist chance is hardcoded and works independently of the Tenacity stat so changing that would be a significantly larger and more farreaching change than we were willing to bite off with Dengar but theres no reason we wouldnt consider changing it in the future if it became important. The other reason is that this makes it slightly more clear what happens when a unit has both Tenacity Up and Tenacity Down at the same timethe unit always has the minimum chance to Resist but it just so happens that their minimum chance to Resist is temporarily . This is admittedly a pretty weaselly resolution but I dont think the alternative solutions either Down trumps Up or they cancel out are better or more intuitive. It definitely isnt helped by current UI limitations that prevent the buff indicators from displaying both a buff and a debuff to the same stat at the same time theyre both there but only one will be shown.TLDR is that Dengars functionality hasnt changed the wording of the text was corrected to reflect the way it has always functioned and it functions that way because of a lot of tangled reasons that arent simple or quick to sort out. Sorry for the confusion.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d64le9z,22,t5_39umt

I do struggle with double taunt teams so I have s crit damage boosted to  and potency at about  so I can hope to land an ability block while still doing hefty damage. When I face a double taunt team I ignore Rey shes not as devastating to me as she used to be and I target sth first. As for your nebit question when his turn comes around if QGJ is ability blocked I will normally taunt unless it looks like I can mow down a character with the double assist. If he is not ability blocked and hasnt used humbling blow I will use the assist. Almost all top teams in my shard have QGJ aside from other droid and clone teams. I love nebit and since Ive never been a rg user its pretty cool to have someone with khealth and k protection right now.

With a little bump to potency you can regularly be top  in raids. In heroic farming guilds raids finish pretty fast. You generally wont have time for a second or third attack anyway.If your guild wont be ready for T soon I recommend cutting your losses and checking guild recruitment megathread to find a heroic farming guild asap. If you are an active daily player any guild will jump on you with that roster.As for developing characters Ive  stared jawas for mod challenges and hoarding resources shop currencies atm.

8806947,0,t3_50mh9g,Thanks for the advice guys! One thing I think I said that came across wrong was the relaxed guild thing I meant relaxed as far as rules. The big problem weve been having is crushing t before half the guild even got a chance to participate were not casual but we also dont have the firepower on the low end to finish t. Our one attempt at t just barely failed we had about  of phase  left. So most of my questions pertained to whats the best way to schedule raids so everyone can participate. I like the idea of  hour no damage to let everyone get on the board. Will anyone that ties with  get the same rewards?Also the dividing into teams thing was so my officers can be in charge of kicking and recruiting their own team so the responsibilities are more evenly divided because so far all my officers do is start raids when Im not on.

Yoda is pretty weak in most of his other aspects Ackbar is only run for high speed Wiggs combos he is also a Rebel so he heats Emperor damage like crazy Yoda too. EE can cleanse but isnt run due to his low damage and weak stats. Id say he is pretty op. AOE stun is gross in a game like this where stun makes your team miss turns. High damage from other teams means if you miss your first turn you will likely lose. Shock powercreeps Heal and Buff immunity as well as preventing TM gain for important characters like Anakin and B. Emperor can self heal with AOE offense up and boost his and VaderTarkin potency to an unbelievable number where you are pretty much guaranteed some degree of success on your debuffs. He has it made. He should have it made because he is the Emperor. Saying Rex counters him because Rex is literally the only thing standing between Emperor and complete Arena domination isnt really fair especially given that Rex is still pp. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,d909vu3,1,t5_39umt

Chances are someone at Google thought of the idea of giving EA money for SWGOH and Apple didnt consider it at all? Its something different with plattform exclusive title but making content in a game for different plattforms exclusive... this is just bad.I would like to see the average spent per person of an iOS user vs. Android. Most likely iOS players spent more. Way to treat your loyal customers. Definitley cutting down on my spending for the game just out of principle.Edit to extend on the exclusivity. There is not even a way for iOS user to obtain the character. I cant even decide to give CG money to get it. It just not there. Which is when one argues that CG cares about the money they get from Google a bad move because they could make even more money by making this content obtainable through ingame purchases.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,daxm5ho,2,t5_39umt

If Anakin is there you can take him out if you want and then Wedge but if Anakin has used his aoe already then kill Wedge first then Anakin. You dont need to take out Lando first.

Why arent they using their droid squads there anymore? Because typical droid squads dont do that much damage.  Which toons are more common right now is not an indicator of a potential new P hAAT meta breaking in. Lumi is very common in lower damage arena teams shes not the best option there though and that is why she is not meta.There is an early trend of players moving to this model.

Something to address issues other than just the next patch. Talk about how you want Arena to look in the future if you do or do not want to change Guild War etc I know these are old issues. just giving examples. I thought the announcement that you guys were going to rework AAT Normal was great. You said you were going to change it but didnt know exactly how yet. I loved that. Just my cents Regarding the droidjawa event. If you guys ran this more frequently I believe the rewards would be worth it. For now in my humble opinion this was not worth me farming a whole droid to get  Dathcha shards.Thank you for your work.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dbxiuwe,1,t5_39umt
10176630,0,t1_dbxi5bt,Im very hesitant to discuss the KSO event for a variety of reasons but I can say that I am generally not a huge fan of bloating peoples time investment. The intention is very simply for people to play the tier that is appropriate for them based on their level. If I configure events like Escape from Jedha two things happen  Max level players will do every tier to maximize rewards. This means that to hit the expected target I need to distribute the rewards across all tiers instead of making one tier that is valuable all on its own. Credit Heist v vs v is a good example if this. This also makes people feel like they must do every tier which inflates their play time. Speaking purely for myself as a player of the game I dont want to do this. Events should be like a treat or a dessert. Some are a slice some are a whole cake. You get the idea. Eventually people get tired of feeling like they must do every tier for every event. You see the threads about time investment in tournaments. When we eventually have many more recurring events I dont want to generate a similar sentiment.The result is that the attemptswins are shared across all tiers. Does this make sense?,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dbxksdj,37,t5_39umt

10320913,0,t1_dccrfwq,Dont try to do too many things at once or everything will suffer. Remember that your arena rank is the most important because of the crystals so focus on that team first and if you have any resource left then you can work on something else. You probably cant build a whole second team at the same time so build it a character at a time. You wont really be a rancor star until you are higher level anyways. It looks like youve been spreading your arena currency around a bit focus it on one character until they are maxed ST Han would be a good choice or AA. I wouldnt spend anything else on Sidious as he helps you nowhere. Luminara will mostly just be useful in GW youll want to look for a better arena team member. You could start building Biggs and Wedge for their awesome combo they are both pilots as well so that would help your fleet. I would suggest for arena you run LandoL ST Han Boba AA   at the moment with the goal of going to Wiggs Lando ST Han AA. Also rebels are useful in the tank raid and for getting Palp eventually they also have a fleet commander and pilots among them so that works out in lots of areas. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dcdxkjh,1,t5_39umt

And I can not replace Wedge as leader for AA or Lando because in that case rebel team is not able to heal themselves..  So I guess I will have to try it again in  monthseditHA!!!! I made it!!!

10375654,0,t1_dck40e7,fair enough.you did ask for ELI so Ill try to honor that.  Its really hard to simplify so far in a lot of cases though.I think instead of a broad overview which I cant think how to simplify that far Ill try to go back to your specific questions that you asked when you say weaker teams or stronger teams Im guessing that you are referring to the single rolledup strength number that each team is given.  This doesnt account for reinforcements or for how well your individual ships do with each other.  Basically youre looking at a veryrolledup version of a very complicated thing so maybe the enemy isnt weaker or stronger than you  they just look that way based on a single inherentlyflawedbecauseitisoversimplified methodology.AI also plays a big role.  A human who knows whats going on will beat the games relatively simple AI every time unless RNG or overall team strength is uneven.  One the human can make better decisions.  Two the AI is predictable and therefore the human can force it to make bad decisions.  Your points still hold true in many cases though even if the battle is on full auto so AI def doesnt explain everything. You asked what specifically determines the outcome of battles.  If you watch them unfold youll start to see though youll have to watch many before you really have a feel for everything thats happening.  At their core battles end when one side is out of ships.  Damage obviously plays a big role and so does protection and other forms of damage removal.  Taunts force nonoptimal play.  Other buffs and debuffs affect damage and health either directly or indirectly.You asked if gear is more important than abilities.  If you mean the level of the abilities of the toon itself than the answer is that theyre about even... The link above gives the exact numbers but in general leveling up an ability is worth about  pieces of gear on a comparable toon Im estimating which gear level youre prob working on given an ability level.If youre asking about gear vs ship abilities thats harder to say.  One gives you more options while another gives you more base stats.  Also are  pieces of gear as expensive to farm as  ability upgrade?   to ?  If you make some broad assumption like that your toon is at gear level  and that your total ship has about  power then one item of gear increases your toons power by about ..  You can compare that to what youre getting from that specific ability but the ability is probably better than  piece of gear.You asked about good synergies but thats also very complicated.  For me I looked at every ship and figured out for myself what I wanted to build.  Synergy isnt just something that can be rolled into a stat either its based on how you fight and who youre fighting against.  Still to simplify here are  synergies that I see more often than others.Ackbarbased rebels team.  This also synergizes with the rebels Wiggs arena team that many people build.Macebased taunt and tanks team.  Requires Plo Koon bc he and Mace both have targetable taunts.  You can always be taunting here unless enemy has good buff removal.Executrixbased tie fighters team.  This takes advantage of the synergy of the  tie fighters and adds some of the other powerful ships as well.So thats a long post for an ELI but I think I did okay at simplifying individual concepts down.  Youre losing a lot in the nuances but its hopefully a starting point.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dck564j,1,t5_39umt

Vader is very hard to farm and Emperor Palpatine requires a high level Rebel team just to unlock and a virtually maxed out Rebel team to get him to .   You could run Sith without Palpy but thats really killing a lot of the advantage you get by running Sith.  You may as well just put Vader on a Bounty Hunter team under Boba Fett at that point.

10562233,0,t1_dd59hep,I dont get how you say that isnt hard to achieve. I have yet to get  speed on  mods for any of my toons. Speed is so random. For example I have a single plus mod with over  speed. A SINGLE one and its not even a set I want but I use it for the speed. This is what is dividing the game more than anything.  People act like its easy to just slap together a random drop on needed shapes with correct primary stats and then get lucky with boosts. Last  gold mods I bought from store. I have gotten  speed boost to get it to . And mod farming is literally grey mods on left hand side based on the tracked stats so you are holding out hope on store to proc something useable or mod packs for decent right hand sided mods. I bought two mod packs last time they came and only a single one had a speed secondary and it was a  dot. It did not hit. I have full G arena team and can climb as high as ish on my server if I get good RNG and right teams to fight on way up but Im capped out literally because of something I cant control which is speed mods.  And thank god Im on an easier arena server or Id be completely crippled by lower arena payouts than I already am. Its not even the arena stuff that bothers me. Its that they have balanced AAT and LS B etc. around the expectation of people having these easy to get speed secondary mods.This isnt to attack you personally but a complaint on this mindset that its so easy to speed up your toons which its not. Its literally random and uncontrollable. I can control gearing up by saving crystals and buying from shipments but there is nothing players can control about mods. Its an infuriating game mechanic. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dd5ck0t,3,t5_39umt

However there are even more that feel the opposite arguing that even that is excessive. The point that I was trying to get at had been that we all have varied ideas of what is considered reasonable for a game such as this. Although purely speculation I seems that there is a segment of the FP player base that uses their badge of honor as a means to argue that those that invest into the game are the problem. I would have to agree with your statement on the more competitive aspect of the game. Given time the difference between those that have invested and those that havent becomes rather minute.

However there used to be many more useless characters and CG has been going through reworking entire factions. Its only a matter of Time before Jedi see the love as well as other characters.

10869169,0,t3_5vcyrj,IMO it would generally hurt them. The general principals Ive learned from using them is that Droids must go first and Droids must kill someone opening round  or severely hinder the attackers. If I dont do this I tend to lose. So first why I choose B With pretaunts being the new standard I find Ive remodded B to go first these days. I have to kill the attackers or I lose. So as an example with empire I first have B clear the pretaunt and then i continue to erase EP and TFP from the board with the opening salvo. For Chaze you need to get rid of one of the attackers that have the Buff Immunity. I couldnt do this without B going first as Chirrut would just cleanse my Buff Immunity. Or at least I couldnt do it as easily.Life with droids using a Pretaunt If I were attacking with the pretaunt Id be severely hindered on the offense side. Id have to first chew through the enemy pretaunt. By the time I do most likely theyve killed off JE or an IG unit. It tends to not go so well. Ive seen K more appropriately used where going against AOE teams.On the flip side if I saw droids without B and with a Pretaunt Id say oh sweet and send in Sun Fac to dispel the pretaunt. I could attack whomever I wanted since the droids will have several AOE chances to trigger SF counter. So honestly its like starting off v since the pretaunter isnt doing his only job. Also since the enemy droids wouldnt be able to dispel theyd be mostly be attacking my Shorty but not much else. Id have time to setup my debuffs on them since they have no cleansers and take out JE.As a result I dont see lots of reasons to go this route. But a lot depends on your shard and what works. If it works for you by all means have at it. I think I just feel theres more downside than upside when I think about the tenants of what makes droids successful for me. Who knows maybe I suck and am missing something big but thats my opinion. Good luck!,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,de12sqk,1,t5_39umt

There cg has answered us already. After the event finally cycles out who knows maybe the event will happen twice then there will be a  month period where his shards shall only be in chromium card drop tables. Even still this is sorta fp since gems arent hard to come by although the odds arent in our favor. Then after that period he will be added to loot or reward tables and be farmable.

11001704,0,t1_deeilb5,Those  make a decent core. I dont see another strong option for rounding out your team on your roster longterm that you have ready. A couple ideas for shortterm solutions thoughLuminara  Tie Fighter Pilot  more characters to inflict ability block and add a little more punch. Old Daka  Royal Guard Stuns plus autotaunt for tankiness Daka will compete with Boba for cantina points though. Battles will take longer but itll take longer to beat you too.Dooku can always be used though hes not all that amazing but you have him ready to go. Jedi Consular is also a pilot so using him would be  birds with one stone. Geonosian Soldier could be an option as well hits harder and is a pilot but hell fall off eventually too. Just really need a couple of decent bodies to round out the team so theres some flexibility there depending on what youd like to do. Youll likely want a healer in one of the slots for a while the th is more flexible.In the long term itd be nice to add more sith. Building a rebel team to unlock Palpatine etc. But that can be down the road a bit. Dont know beyond that best I can offer shooting from the hip.

One good way to do that is to get the daily crystal sub as overall it will net you more and help you towards that goal. If you do that consistently and are able to refresh fairly often you end up overtaking anyone who whaled super hard initially and then stopped spending.

Its like yes we all know GK is awesome. Hes one of those characters that works in just about any team and makes it much better. It doesnt really mean that Jedi as a faction are that great just that one character is. It also doesnt help that GK is unobtainable for the majority of players due to needing to be in a really dedicated guild meaning when most people are talkingasking about Jedi teams theyre not considering him.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dexxo7u,1,t5_39umt

11227315,0,t1_df4kqfn,Maul is still excellent for Arena though so you should still consider him. In fact Im trying to decide on whom to Zeta based on whether it will help counter zMaul teams specifically.Like you I also run a mostly Rebel team for Arena Lando Wedge Biggs STH and Boba. Since Rebels can defeat almost any other team especially with an autoTaunter like Baze its just the ones they cant beat  such as those reliant on Evasion and Crit Immunity  that are of concern.That said Barriss is an excellent choice. Theres a Wedge L Biggs Chirrut Baze and zBarriss team on my shard that still manages to beat some of the zMaul teams.I checked your SWGoH.gg profile and your Arena rank seems unusually low for such a good team composition. Did you quit playing for a while? If so Im not sure if what I said above will be relevant. The upper ranks of older shards are apparently full of zMaul teams so continuing with Rebels even with zBarriss might not be good.To illustrate what I mean here are a few screenshots of my early November  leaderboard  Theres a clear divide between the zMauls and the Rebels. Prior to the Zetas almost all of us could get to rank  during our payout now its just those with zMauls who can do it easily.Rank  on that list is the player with the Wiggs Chaze zBarriss team that I mentioned. That player gets into the top  with that team. Rank  uses zMaul along with Chaze so you could aim for that although theres also a zSidious and zBoba on that team.P.S.

Ultimately it would honestly depend on what you face often and whether you need a cleanser or not perhaps. I face a few rex teams so I personally use Baze on my team as the tank. So again it varies.

STHAN is a fast amp brittle tank that will mostly die to feed all your team huge chunk of TM meaning it works really well with pretty much any rebel but especially slower ones like Lando.Cassian is a support. He is really good at debuffing stuff applying buff immunity and deals more damage than STHAN. However if really work best with KSO synergy is not THAT crazy but still really noticeable. So that mean with cassian you might want to bring KSO which mean you will already have a tank.Personnaly I think Cassian goes best with R.O. characters such as Jyn in Lead or KSO while STHAN goes best with older rebels like Lando.,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dfb4xql,3,t5_39umt

Completing the raid as a group over  days is ideal and as the raids get too easy and it just get blitzed in  seconds everyone should still get the payout even if they are asleep on the other side of the world when the  second raid happens. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dfkn9bd,3,t5_39umt

Simming every challenge Tuesday through Saturday requires  tickets each day.  Simming everything on Sunday requires  tickets.  Simming everything on Monday requires  tickets.

11556126,0,t1_dg5thhj,GW becomes x easier with Wiggs.Right now your team has basically no selfsustain.  Thats why youre struggling with GW.  A Wedge led rebel team heals when they crit  max health and kill opponents  max health.  The burst potential of Wiggs means you can eliminate major threats instantly and the AOE of Wedge  Lando can take out early nodes without the enemy even getting a turn.  That saves your protection for tougher nodes.  GW was getting tough for me at your level range too but Wedge completely changed that.  The selfhealing is just plain ridiculous.Heres my profile Ill run my arena squad for the first node to give STH turn meter for a node  or .  Second node is arena squad with Palpatine in for STH to give him turn meter his AOE stun can be a game changer.  Third node onwards I mix in Kylo or Ackbar as needed.  Ackbar counters Vader pretty nicely. Hope this helps!,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dg5w2tn,1,t5_39umt

For example the most popular meta team right now Maul led sith is nothing special without his leader ability being zetad.Dont ignore it. Dont let it scare you either. Its a bit different from ground combat but the basics are the same. Youll get the hang of it soon enough. Identify who the priority targets are and who are the most important to keep alive on your team. Bring ships with good damage and at least one dispeller preferably two. I recommend Ahsoka and Vader. If you cant suffer the unreliable target locks the solution is  Vaders tie it recently made it into the shipments start farming it. Hes easily good enough to use at  star but youll have to protect him. Good news is Biggs will keep him alive. Theyre so good together. ,SWGalaxyOfHeroes,dgay1hj,2,t5_39umt

Then kill Biggs his tripleassist can OHK most characters if you are at the level that would make this a difficult node.Then you can go back to grinding Baze down drop Wedge after that as his armor down can be painful and finally Chirrut who will be happily healing himself and is often last man standing.Oddly enough the best team to take this down maybe the team itself. Wiggs for the DPS and BazeChirrut for the CleanseHeal combo. Remember both Unload and Fierce Reprisal can nix the Taunt.
