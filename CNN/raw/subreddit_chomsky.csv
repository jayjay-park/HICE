1463816,0,t3_2axh7s,As a frequenter of this sub Id been wondering what all of this BDS stuff was about so just now clicked OPs links and read up on that article in The Nation and the other one.It looks like its an issue of tactics vs. strategy.  Of course the Occupied Palestinian Territories OPT are still being annexed by Israel and as Chomsky points out the simple fact is that U.S. support for these actions is decisive and we as citizens of the U.S. should be paying a lot more attention to that.That said what to do about it?  ...Well it sounds like Chomsky is saying that it might be better to seize something of the moment and push for oneandonlyone goal  A Settlement on  Border.  ...Its clear amp simple understood by all parties and has support of the World community.By contrast adopting a strategy of several other factors including BDS andor recognition of Israel etc. etc. will be much harder to reach agreement on between several parties.  That would risk diluting the message and splintering off certain factions of support when every single one is needed.Chomsky usually says that while he may have certain research amp analytical ability he has no special expertise on choosing specific tactics.  But Id be inclined to agree on this specific focused approach.  That is given certain current factors it does seem like it might be better to concentrate all effort on Settlement for Returning to the  Border. ,chomsky,cizrk3z,4,t5_2qrqa

4018762,0,t1_cre0ju8,gt You say that Im tasked with moralising in the same way a religious fanatic does as though this is some kind of burden... But you imply that youre capable of doing the same thing when you write Absolutely. I do not escape the problem Im trying to highlight if its a problem at all. That my moral positions just like all moral positions boil down to sets of values that are ultimately subjective and arbitrary and thus nonjustifiable. It goes back to your earlier statement  Are the very beliefs about what is ethical and how they inform human behaviour just relative to different cultures and therefore pointless to talk about?It is worth talking about them because if you agree on fundamental underlying value sets then any derived moral disagreement is potentially just a disagreement in methodology or more important someone has derived incorrect conclusions. However if you do not agree on fundamental value sets then youre right  talking about it is not really worth it. It would be akin to approaching someone who states that they rely on faith based reasoning and trying to convince them that evidence based reasoning is superior. Youd be appealing to evidence based reasoning the very thing they outright dismiss. gtSo you can find those reasons or at least imply that you can but I dont berate you for not expounding on them. Mainly because Id pay you the respect of assuming that your reasons for judging an organisation like al Queada as being morally inferior would be more or less the same reasons I would give. gtSo when you ask me questions about how certain actions are justifiable in one instance but not in another it seems to me like a bit of a waste of time having to explain things that you imply you already know. But the question is not about whether any one individual can arrive at these moral differences or similarities the question is meta from that aspect. Its about how you know those moral differences are a representationresult of being more morally good. Which seems to beg the question. Its hard for me to articulate this into words so Im blaming myself for the miscommunication. Its the difference between asking if something is moral and asking why one ought to appeal to a particular value set by which to derive whether or not something is moral. It seems to me and I could be wrong that ultimately you I al quaeda are all advocating a position that boils down to something we simply cant justify. There is no way for me to appeal to the value of a single human life to someone who only views human life in the scope of religious ends. And there is no way for someone who only views human life in the scope of religious ends to appeal to these religious ends as something that overrides human life to someone like you or I. But ultimately all of us have value sets that override human life in some specific contexts unless maybe for a pacifist it just seems like the religious martyr has value sets that override human life in general. So while I agree with you that intent matters and I even agree with you specifically that the stated intent of U.S. officials is more moral than the stated intent of al quaeda members when the action is the same I am not so confident that Im on the side of good especially when that action is being engaged in and justified by an institution like the state. I think this lack of confidence is necessary when challenging the statusquo  and I think the statusquo ought to be challenged how do you know something is working towards stated ends through means you find agreeable unless you empirically challenge the status quo?. But ultimately it seems to me that moralizing is really just preaching to the choir. Pragmatically I understand that it is useful in determining optimal action given particular variablescontexts whether or not someone is actually moral or immoral isnt going to matter if they hold to differing value sets. ,chomsky,credb2u,1,t5_2qrqa

Now I get a lot of guff from the left for how critical I am of Greenwald  but the fucker openly defended Citizens United  and has never backed off that defense.Plain and simple we already had a political system dominated by rich  corporate interests. Greenwald the lawyer didnt feel they had enough control and advocates that corporations arent just people but Super People  as they are immortal and not bound by citizenship as us mere mortals are.What I mean is people like Radley Balko so beloved by the fake Left writing about police oppression while at the same time advocating nothing change economically  unless its change that favors business interests. The average black in America owns  cents of wealth to every dollar the average white in America owns. No matter how many articles one writes  reads about police brutality NOTHING is going to change for blacks without some form of wealth redistribution  even if just in the form of expanded social services  more funding for education and health  minimum wage raises.There are trillions and trillions of dollars sitting in off shore tax shelters. When I said sacrifice in that context basically that could simply me some Alex P. Keaton not wanting to sacrifice his chance at maybe owning  billion dollars in personal wealth some day.

5152676,0,t1_cv6umfe,This doesnt seem true at least where Im from. We have private buses and most people use them instead of driving cars. In the case of America from what little I know it seems that the car companies were so successful in marketing their products combined with low oil prices that a majority of people stopped looking at public transit as an alternative. At least the story according to a classic marketing case study is that the railway companies suffering from marketing myopia forgot that they were in the transportation business and not just the railway business. So the car companies successfully changed the culture of the place to the point where public transit isnt much of a need for a required minimum number of people to ensure business success. Do the markets claim unlimited choices? Is it fair to criticize the market if it doesnt have an answer to someones need to show up for work in a space shuttle? Im playing the devils advocate here and while it does seem evil that a legitimate choice was taken from the people it seems to me all it would take for public transit to make a return would be a minimum viable number of people wanting it towilling to pay for it assuming a free market.,chomsky,cv73934,1,t5_2qrqa

He wanted to help him that he wouldnt be subject to a vicious campaign of harassment intimidation slander and physical violence in a crude attempt to silence him just because of he had absurd views about Holocaust.gt but I do believe hes an antisemiteSo you believe Chomsky is an antiSemite because he defended Faurissons rights to express his views?,chomsky,dbs4sk3,2,t5_2qrqa

So GoI controlled what was called the commanding heights of the economy steel coal railways banks... regulated agricultural prices directed research ISRODRDOBARC... set tariffs  however GoI or the state governments didnt own everything. Mega corporations like the TATAsBirlasHindujasWadiasGodrej familyJains and countless smaller ones existed even during that time.,chomsky,dbz6w4r,3,t5_2qrqa
10280671,0,t1_dc91y87,Why are you trying to discredit this article?  Yes it makes the US look bad.  So what?  Every word of it is true.  The US has done a TON of shitty things.  Its time that we as Americans realize this.  I feel this needs to get talked about a lot more.  The average citizen probably doesnt even know what COINTELPRO is.  The only way that America will stop doing shitty things is if we openly talk about all of its shitty past.  History is important ESPECIALLY the shitty stuff.  AND  this article barely mentions Putin.  Dont know why he frightens you so much....the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country.

10878667,0,t3_5vg6q4,There are too many points for me to addressuryud made some excellent points but in particular why invade Iraq? Why not South Africa or Indonesia or Israel or any number of states which had committed severe atrocities. Why is bombing and invading those states not contemplated?She pretends like Iraq doesnt have much oil and that its expensive to extract. While Iraq has some of the cheapest best oil in the world. I think Chomskys arguments are pretty good. There are many you can find here but here are few. On Iraq Israel and the US ElectionsIts the Oil stupid!
