150266,0,t1_cerrbyj,So far I like this one the best out of the songs youve written for this. One thing that you do that Im very envious of is how you layer instruments. It seemed to me like the song was heading down hill I really liked the intro but it seemed like a lot of lyrics were being delivered with out a strong melody to back them up but that bridge part around  is for sure a keeper. It seems like you really pay attention to your lyrics or at least thats how it comes across. Overall thats a good thing but sometimes it does seem like theyre delivered sort of awkwardly trying to fit a bunch of syllables into a small space. I definitely think practicing the song more would help out with that a ton. Its a delicate balance between sounding awkward saying something and sounding great saying nothing but I think with more practice you wouldnt have to worry about it too much.,songaweek,cevjo9m,2,t5_2zl5o

If you hadnt mentioned the chords were the same throughout I dont think I would have noticed. The way the different parts weave in and out is great and that cello line is beautiful. Cellos really are the best. I sort of pictured this song as scoring the last wrap up scene of a movie then playing through the credits.

394984,0,t1_cflir4c,When you say you havent figured out the best way to do it do you mean the actual process of recording or just arranging it for electric? If its the latter just go ahead and skip all of this and just go down to my last couple of sentences.Whats your current process with the acoustic? If you have an interface that can record two tracks at once Ive had pretty good luck with a live mic  an LDC. My current electric setup is a Sennheiser e  a bit offcenter from the cone right up against the grill  an MXL offset  deg. from roughly the center of my x cab several inches out. Ive been happy with the results Ive gotten with that setup.If you dont have the mics but you have a Line  POD those can get pretty good results with modeling and its much simpler cause you can just plug straight in.I like the song quite a lot with the acoustic though. Great job.,songaweek,cflpfb4,2,t5_2zl5o
395346,0,t3_1yez0j,A Stuttered Reflection FolkDreamy ThemedInstead of creating a traditional song I wrote two violin parts scored them together performed them each and then reversed the song. I then wrote some lyrics to the reversed song saved it and then reversed the whole thing. Then started to toy with it to get it to where it is now! Feels kinda dreamy which fits the timeframe that I crafted the song in but I love how my violin came out!The theme comes in with that clash between vocals being sung in one direction and the violins being played in the other direction which hopefully works themewise for you guys!Would love feedback as always!,songaweek,cflqryn,2,t5_2zl5o

437702,0,t1_cfpx65f,This is really the first time Ive written a song that was directly from me if that makes any sense.  I wrote lyrically about something that frustrates me.  Normally I just write lyrics  theyre often about fantastical situations or feelings of psychosis  something where I disassociate myself from the lyrics.  Ive specifically avoided weeks where the theme related to emotion.Secondly some people write these amazing chord progressions and I feel like Im stuck in the s sometimes with these basic chord songs.

634011,0,t1_cgc4u6o,That definitely is a happy accident! Between this and the juggling ball shaker I like the holistic approach youve got going on here. It fits the aesthetic. I think I did read something about people having a dominant ear. I also find myself wanting to put stuff in the right rather than the left I put my guitar in full band stuff in the right speaker and have the other guitarist in the left. Still youve got a whole stereo spectrum and its going to make the piece sound bigger if you use it. Something else to consider is trying to keep a fairly narrow stereo field maybe pan shaker L and banjo R so that at the end you pan everything L and R and things get very big.Ending harmony stuff Its fine for the melody to take the previous harmony line but why not have a low harmony which is the previous melody line just continuing. Mix it so its clear which is the melody. I would love to hear it go even higher but believe me I know about range limitations. Still there are things you can do. You could always strip out the low and some of the high end then bury it a bit in the mix so its more of a texture than a vocal part. You could also throw some subtle distortion on a higher take that isnt perfect. I do like that the end doesnt fade out but I also do think its a little long. Thats a lot of what Im saying. If you keep adding things which you do but youre also subtracting them itll keep the ending interesting. ,songaweek,cgcc5ww,1,t5_2zl5o

Because I ran out of time there is bass missing but I tried to fiddl around with guitar and kickEQing to make up for it.Part III Rebuild PostRock Ambient Stuff ThemedHere I made a simple electronic beat with some guitarlayering over it its pretty calm still driving at least thats what I wanted to go for and should be the most likable track of those threeEDIT The ending of Part III is meant to be like this before someone asks ,songaweek,cnp758i,1,t5_2zl5o

6226188,0,t1_cyx7m2a,Intro was the electric guitar part copied and then reversing the last sustained chord.  Chop out just that part and then butt it up against the top of the track right before the .  Its a little gimmicky but I still love the trick.  Guitars were all live in the room.  Acoustic was a late s Yamaha LA micd with the Gefell UMs into the Great River  the th fret about  out.  Electric guitar was close micd with a Heil PR into TG preamp.  Amp was a silverface Vibrolux.  Once in the box I used the UAD LAA plug on the acoustic to control the dynamics of the picking a bit.  The electric guitar got EQ and a  plug to control things.  I also automated the volume of the rhythm electric a lot especial during the solo and the bridge.  It got wayyyy too loud in the bridge but still sounded really big even db down or more.  The guitar solo was more aggressively EQd and I used an amazing modulation plug on it called Excalibur which created the very focused solo sound.I always try and use panning to keep parts out of each others way so the acoustic is  oclock left and then the electric was more like  oclock to the right.  I used a touch of small roomchamber verb on the acoustic and the electric started out pretty wet.  Im also very careful to record with good headroom on the way in so that the plugins dont get hit too hard and nothings clipping.  That tends to help keep things feeling open and airy.

9318655,0,t1_d8wyjb3,Thank you! Like I said I have tendinitis so I cant really play anything... I shouldnt even be typing or writing songs for that matter haha. Everything here is midi. I think its my first piece with piano as the lead instrument as well at least from my recorded pieces.Artwork is from Daehyun Kim I forgot to mention in the soundcloud descriptions thanks for reminding me! Its great I found it recently and it really resonated with me.,songaweek,d8x7he5,2,t5_2zl5o

I really like the synth amp guitar. Great track. Im surprised you are as dismissive of it as you are kind of...there pretty cool to my ears. ,songaweek,daxtmhs,1,t5_2zl5o
10291326,0,t1_dc7791e,I love the idea of flair addition for that. In fact Ill do mine right now.,songaweek,dcaksxn,1,t5_2zl5o
10384749,0,t1_dckpeng,really love this track. great chord progression in the chorus especially. you nailed the storytelling theme too. nice turns of phrase. ,songaweek,dcl6byu,1,t5_2zl5o
10393242,0,t3_5nhdml,tomatoes ElectronicExperimental ThemedThis is a weird synthychopped up song featuring samples from an NPR interview with Dan Deacon where he compares making music to growing tomatoes. sort of a story!Ive had this interview saved on my computer for a while and wanted to do a song sampling it.  At first I set out to imitate the storytelling in the song  Good Bricks though the final product didnt really end up like it.  I also drew inspiration from was the artist Worlds End Girlfriend who has a song titled Storytelling.  Not that particular song but rather the frantic pace abrupt segues and breakbeat drums that are common in most of his music.  I think the different riffs could have come in at a more relaxed pace because they seem to be competing with the vocal samples.  Could definitely use some EQ love too.Thanks for listening ,songaweek,dcm520y,1,t5_2zl5o
10549478,0,t1_dcv1x0f,Productions sounding great on this and the chorus is catchy nice job!I like the twangy sound you got going on in the chorus  the sparse high backing vocals are a nice touch too,songaweek,dd3wgrs,1,t5_2zl5o
10556132,0,t3_5q8wp4,Steeple ElectronicInstrumentalLoFi ThemedWhenever I think of love I think of weddings and whenever I think of weddings I think of church organs so I based the chord structure around and organ and the rest kinda sorta fell into place!,songaweek,dd4nngv,1,t5_2zl5o
10682694,0,t1_ddfdvkr,Yay a new animal series song! I love those.  I know a lot about these rhinos did you know the conservancy sawed off their horns to help them avoid being targets from poachers but none of the surviving ones can reproduce naturally so its all just a matter of time. That shit makes me so damn sad I couldnt even begin to craft a song about it. Maybe someday. Anyway so I like the song  it does some of those feelings justice. And also I like your voice better when its a little more raw like this  those little moments of being off are actually where the emotion comes through best. ,songaweek,ddhu7tv,1,t5_2zl5o

10750565,0,t1_ddopomq,The intro was great but the sound of the lead instrument at  took me out of it.  I find it grating whenever it comes in.  Your vocals fit really nicely into the track and are nicely produced good job.  Id bring the thumb piano down in the mix though I like its addition.  But it should be just a padrhythmic element barely audible.  Right now its competing for focus.  In general its a solid track but I feel like the chorus needs a shift.  It doesnt really feel like a chorus at this point.  The verses are really nice great lyrics but they feel like theyre building to something and the chorus as it stands doesnt deliver.  Id alter the arrangement at that point give it a distinct feel.,songaweek,ddou6yh,2,t5_2zl5o
10793285,0,t1_ddpjfam,Ugh this last verse. You hit this character so well that I feel uncomfortable now and a little mad at you. cause if one ever actually comes  Its not me that itll take is so familiartrue right now its kind of devastating. Also I dig your internal rhymes and theres probably a literary term for whatever harness on my hardships is but Ill just go with nice.,songaweek,ddt91n1,2,t5_2zl5o
11072411,0,t1_dejsbrc,I must have said it before but your lyrics are always amazing. Theres something in the way you deliver them too that really gives them weight. I really want to hear you and uFranklyTheRobot collab do it!,songaweek,den1pxk,1,t5_2zl5o
