Cenk was making Sams point and then trying to use it against Sam!

3160248,0,t1_cooez1n,How is it a straw man? I have read Waking Up and I am using Harriss precise argument and he has given a hefty amount of credible evidence to defend his argument. There is genuine curiosity on my part about how the heck anything could have a source of motivation but thats obviously due to my layman understanding of the matter as Im not a neuroscientist. Im sure a neuroscience professor or scientist could easily answer my questions to my satisfaction if given the opportunity. Anyway how is my argument flawed or a strawman? I am pointing out that I agree on this matter since Harris hasnt distorted anything. And for your information I have a bachelors in Political Science and Im deeply disturbed with how Harris presents the most ridiculous and borderline racist arguments against Muslims. It seems most people here just dont understand political implications.The argument against me is Harris hasnt SAID that! okay but we can clearly ascertain the implications of his statements with him consistently touting analogies to promote ideas of killing people in Muslim countries. His argument is also discriminatory once he began touting Muslim unreason and insisting they were all th century adherents. Most Arab countries exist the same way as we in America do  that is as human beings living in homes using the internet and purchasing food at grocery stores. Harris acts like all they do is shout and scream infidels! and comeup with ways to kill other people they hate. Also most Muslim countries admire the U.S.s system of equal rights they just want to live under a Muslim version of democracy. Granted that means women wearing veils and having less rights  but the U.S.s own improvements in womens rights took  years and slavery took  years to get rid of. Its normal for democracies to take long periods of time to improve in peoples rights.,samharris,copk3cn,0,t5_2thqg
3680069,0,t1_cqao0bt,The Nobel Prize winning International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War and other groups just finished an exhaustive examination of excess mortality in Iraq following the invasion. They believe . million and up to  million Iraqis have died as a result with millions more injured or forced from home. The population of Iraq is about  of the US so imagine between  and  million Americans dying in .Now you are convinced that mass civilian deaths from sanctions were debunked because one woman revised her estimates. Wikipedia lists about a dozen different analysts of child deaths from sanctions alone none of them conclude that less than several hundred thousand children killed were the resultBut lets take a step back... Iraq was once the most developed country in the Middle East... what happened and what was the US role throughout? US helps Saddam come to power CIA gives him kill lists for leftists. US arms Saddam in mass war against Iran later secretly arming the Iranians as well LOW end well over a million people are killed in this senseless brutality. Iraqi progress starts to be seriously reversed. After giving an informal greenlight to Saddams plan to reclaim oil wells that historically belonged to Iraq all Kuwait was an Iraqi province the US backtracks and unleashes a mass bombardment of Iraq illegally targeting civilian infrastructure including water plants ports and hospitals. US maintains harsh international sanctions against a destroyed country that relies on food and medicine imports for survival.  US mass bombs Iraq and invades firing the majority of public employees in a country where the government was the main employer arming ethnic militias and paying bounties for huge sweeps of potential insurgents who are then routinely tortured. Families are regularly slaughtered at checkpoints and in night raids. Whole towns are reduced to rubble with i.e. Fallujah full of people inside to prove a point about US power. The US continues to back a corrupt ethnocratic government in Baghdad and continues to greenlight systematic torture things we know from Manning leaks Vol.  radicalizing tens of thousands of young Iraqi men. The US directly and indirectly supports Gulf monarchs quest to funnel arms money and men into the borderlands to fight the Syrian government. What could possibly go wrong?So lets revisit that  to  million dead Iraqis since the invasion. The sanctions played a big part in their deaths as well... the lack of jobs and money the lack of basic medical infrastructure the lack of clean water for people made internal refugees... its so easy for you to look away from that and so comforting to think its somehow propaganda.Take one last step back... say were talking about Nazi conccentration camps and someone is saying... well its not really  million who died it was  million and a lot of people died in the ghetto or on the trains so its not fair to attribute that to the concentration camp total.How would you feel about that person?,samharris,cqbr2wk,11,t5_2thqg
3715984,0,t1_cqbsyky,Response from lcl response was given to autowikibot prob by mistakegtPretty thorough I respect that. there is ongoing controversy about the numbers because surrounding countries reduced their child mortality at a time when Iraq didnt even though it had been before the sanctions.Its like analyzing the deaths in China under Mao... it depends on how many children people would have had and how many would have survived under normal circumstances but those numbers arent stable either.I think we agree on the basics that a lot of kids died because of bad politics and that is a tragedy so I wont press the point.You certainly were not obligated to respond to any of the other  bullet points I mentioned but I wrote them since the context of US influence on Iraq is constantly left out and the question is about western military tactics which in the case of Iraq has to include everything from the arming of Saddam to the two wars and the occupation.Even for the sanctions alone their true damage is not visible by just measuring health statistics in the s but rather to the crippling of an already battered nation creating the kindling for the occupation policies to light into the violent blaze that is modern Iraq.Such a view is not easily proven or disproven with a statistic or two but it is a widely held view among Iraqis of every level from academic and politicians to common people on different sides of the conflict.,samharris,cqfuk3z,2,t5_2thqg

3978936,1,t1_cr9tns1,You have a responsibility to read what someone has written about a topic if you are going to debate that person about that topic. This is especially true for a political debate. Yes Harris read  and then argued with Chomsky about some points in there. OK you dont have to read all the Chomsky sure. But I think you should read more than just .The reason for that is he has written an awful lot and none if it agrees with what traditional history will teach you. And its the basis for all of his arguments about the USAs actions so if you are seeking to understand Chomsky yeah you have to read him or listen to his talks.Chomsky addressed all of Harriss points up to a point when Harris for his part refused to answer Chomskys question which he had asked first throughout the discussion. He is still avoiding the issues Chomsky has raised. Namely Is there any evidence that Clinton had benign intentions in the bombing of Sudan? which Harris asserts. Chomsky answered all of Harris questions except the imagined scenario thought experiment one because he still wants Harris to answer his one question. Chomsky did say that he thinks about intention when judging moral actions repeatedly. Harris still seems to miss that! Chomsky did say that he has written about it before and he has. In fact its been a major theme of his writings. ,samharris,cr9tykk,-1,t5_2thqg
3978964,0,t1_cr98dm1,I appreciate the thoughtful reply.Keep in mind that I actually agree with a lot of what Sam Harris says. I even think that wellbeing and human flourishing is the most useful way to talk about morality. But thats because wellbeing and human flourishing already mattered. So I basically granted this quote to begin with and I think his arguments follow quite well from there but I can also see that from the outside it is a flaw in his argument as a whole.There is a huge difference between physics and morality as far as how easy it is to define. So Im not sure what is fallacious about acknowledging the fact that there are still many competing ideas in this area and that several seem plausible. This happens all the time in science. Different researchers have different operational definitions until there is a clear reason why it should be one over another. You should not be against being able to say why your definition is the best one  thats unscientific. You want me to take your word for it? If it is the best definition you should be prepared to say why. Physicists can tell you why their definition of physics is the most useful among competing definitions. Why cant you? And why does Harris reject the question so flippantly?In hard sciences like physics you have a stated goal increasing understanding of the physical world. If you grant that this is a worthwhile goal then common physics is the best way I know of to achieve it. That can be demonstrated empirically. Harris cannot show his claim empirically.In morality Harris states that the goal is wellbeinghuman flourishing. If you grant that this is a worthwhile goal then his moral landscape or something similar is the best way I know of to achieve it.And if I ask the physicists why we should increase our understanding of the physical world they could give some answer that would likely make sense and satisfy me but if I ask Harris why we should care about wellbeing of others or human flourishing in general he tells me Ive asked a stupid question because he cant answer it properly.There is a fundamental difference as stated above and you dont acknowledge it. That is your fallacy that you are not noticing.I still maintain that wellbeing as an axiom needs to be defended.,samharris,cr9u2pi,1,t5_2thqg

That is why you wrote I have other reasons to object to raping babies. But you are aware that whatever moves you has no moral standing since you deny that moral truth exists. Thus you have no reason to actually listen to that which moves you. Its like if you were hooked up to a group of neuroscientists who pushed a button suddently making you feel that eating coleslaw is morally wrong. Here you would be determined to feel this way but you would relfectively be aware that this moral sensation is entirely arbitrary and without value.

Whats being discussed is what that means whether that is an objective property of the universe true regardless of how I feel or a psychological feeling.

After searching for familiarity on the original thread it looks to me like I began my conversations by asking questions about expertise not familiarity so I must be missing something. Where did I start by asking about familiarity in philosophy?gtWhat position was it of Harris that I was defending again? Have you been paying attention to my responses at all?So lets go through this again. It isnt good to think approvingly of an individual that is dismissed by experts in philosophy. We both agree on this.. Members of this subreddit think approvingly of Harris. We both agree on this.. Harris is dismissed by experts in philosophy. So far the only premise I see you doubting is the third but your explanation for why Harris isnt dismissed by experts in philosophy is doubtful as evidenced by a number of experts that dismiss Harris views and arguments.gtIn it the will isnt actually free.

5237941,0,t1_cvhbgle,gt  a the perpetrators conducting the actions which says nothing about Islam itself being a causeOf course the perpetrators are at fault and not Muslims in general or even Islam necessarily. No one is claiming that Islam itself inevitably results in each Muslim engaging in coercive terrorism. Harris argument is that the specific dogma of Islam contains unusually powerful tools that enable the few who DO choose to engage in terrorism and simultaneously disable the moderate majority from effectively marginalizing the violent few. And remember by VERY FAR the primary recipients of this terrorism are other Muslims. When the violent leaders profess their reasons and those reasons are plausible interpretations of their scripture why should we not believe them when they themselves claim that they attack for religious reasons? Note that even though George W Bush idiotically claimed that God told him to invade Iraq it was not in those terms that he actually got the invasion to happen. If he had tried to go to Congress and say God wants us to invade Iraq he would have been laughed off the hill. By Christians. Instead he was forced to manufacture B.S. reasons like WMDs and try to sell the idea that Saddam Hussein was actually a threat to national security. Of course it was BS. But the fact that he had to sell it in this way to other Christians in an  Christian nation is telling. He lacked the tools within Christianity to commit this crime on religious terms so he was forced to do it on secular ones however specious. Thats how you know that Christianity wasnt a major factor in that invasion. Do you think that leaders in ISIS when trying to convince their subordinates to sack a Kurdish village and behead every male over  are forced to convince their followers to do so on secular terms?gtb such a definition of terrorism serves only the larger terrorists defined by the broader sense of the termI honestly dont know for certain what this means. Are you saying that its fallacious to define the word terrorism using more precise and restrictive language because it lets state violence off the hook? If so then I would just offer that its important to speak precisely and terrorism has a precise meaning because of the moral implications of terrorism vs. state violence. They must be addressed differently and so the words themselves matter. When the US bombs a suspected weapons depot and three innocent people die that might be a crime but it should not be called terrorism. It should be called a war crime. When Russia invades Crimea and annexes land it should be called violent expansionism not terrorism. When the US bombs a civilian bridge because they are angry about an attack on a US official it should be called a war crime not terrorism. When the US tries to manipulate Syria into changing leadership by dropping paratroopers over the Syrian border and videotaping beheadings of Syrian women and children then posting those videos online then we should call that terrorism because thats what it is.Calling Pol Pots murder campaign terrorism doesnt add anything to the conversation and it serves mainly to dilute the meaning of the word terrorism. Calling illegitimate or criminal US violence terrorism serves the same purpose. It matters because we need to deal with actual terrorism differently than we deal with other kinds of criminal state actions and conflating the two makes it harder to move both conversations forward.,samharris,cvhd1ek,7,t5_2thqg

5912621,0,t1_cxu0lb3,gtLets see. You wrote that Noam Chomsky in his debate with Dershowitz said something like If I criticize Iran that will just help the side that Im against. As it turns out when presented with the facts he didnt. Its just a fabrication.As I pointed out above this is ultimately immaterial since Chomsky states elsewhere that he takes the view I attribute to him. gtIf it was not a fabrication then youd have to explain why Chomsky helped the side he was against when he signed an open letter to Mahmoud Ahmadinejad criticizing how Iranian authorities frequently have followed office raids and other harassment with arbitrary arrests and detention in particular of dissident Shirin Ebadi the cofounder of Defenders of Human Rights Center DHRC that provides legal defense for victims of human rights abuses in Iran The New York Review  But so what? All this is is a mild open letter about political prisoners and political harassment of people who are arguing for human rights. Its admirable but its not much of a criticism of the Iranian state or of the monstrously evil totalitarian ideology Islam  on which it is based nor does it offer any hint to the readers of NYRB of how menacing Iran is toward Infidel nation states.Does Chomsky support a policy to weaken the power of Iran or to end its nuclear program? Certainly not. So you can stop trying to peddle this mildly critical letter as if it indicated that Chomskys attitude is any other than I have indicated. Chomsky default position is that his role as a political writer is to maintain be critical of the power system under which he lives not of external political systems with which they power system might go to war. Thats his basic underlying attitude in all his political writing. Everything he does behind with that assumption. gtFrom this it does not follow that its the only task that one sets oneself.Its a direct indication of the attitude that one can quite easily see that from his overall output overwhelmingly aimed at criticism of the West. If the West has any enemies hes not going to spend time pointing out their crimes. Im not really interested in carrying this on any further since Chomskys attitude as I have described it in this thread is obvious to anyone who has read him. Youre not going to read in the pages of Noam Chomsky any information about the dangers that the United States and other Western nations face only their crimes.

He was content to forcefully drop his rebuttal and say something in closing like stop wasting my time with this bullshit as he sipped from that scotch tumbler. Harris would do well to adopt a little bit more of this approach with detractors. Its not always important to find common ground nor is it essential that people understand each other completely.

6856556,1,t3_49o7im,Well I had my mind changed on something.Im a radical feminist and consider myself a very socialjusticeminded person. I originally thought all the safe space stuff was being exaggerated by people like your typical Redditor antifeminist doesnt like nuance has a subtle but very real dislike of women and feminine opinions.But listening to Haidt talk about the cause of this  the new ways children are reared  really gave me a lot to think about.I still think its true that young white cisgendered men are overreacting to this but now I think there might be more to this safespace criticism than I previously thought.edit ... although Im much more skeptical of Haidts assessment of this after Sam questioned him about dropping that prenataltestosterone fact. Him saying you cant say that then immediately trying to find a way to make it sound like of course he would still include it but would be afraid to say it came across as very dishonest to me and now I wonder just how much hes exaggerating.edit  And on that point actually I wish Sam or John would have talked a little about why that fact might be reacted to in that way. Its like in another comment when I pointed out that mentioning crime statistics although true give cover to racist people. So just because its true doesnt mean it actually contributes to the greater good to talk about it or even to know it.In this way if youre going to point out that increased levels of prenatal testosterone seem to contribute to what a child enjoys you should at least also mention that while this may be true its not the whole story. Women are discouraged sometime subtly by society and sometimes explicitly by other people from pursuing STEM careers and while there may be biological factors at play there are certainly social factors that play a huge role in this as well.Im not saying a professor should be contractually obligated to say that but a good professor ought to know how these facts can impact the listener. Im not talking about getting your feelings hurt. Im talking about emboldening a sexist or racist or whateverist person who likes black and white thinking and wants to confirm their narrative. These people exist by the thousands.edit  And rape culture absolutely is a thing John Haidt.

Their perceptual failure actually acts as evidence to support the transcendental nature of their chosen belief The fact that the sublime object is unexplainable just goes to show that it really is beyond the realm of normal everyday human thought.Great. If these are indeed falsifiable claims then show me empirical scientific evidence validating these claims. If you cant point to anything of the sort then you are doing nothing but peddling Zizeks woo for him like a cult follower.gt Just whatever you do dont go around thinking that Zizek is a cult leader.

Theres hardly a serious scientist I know or a serious social scientist that I know from my days in academia that takes him seriously. Hes adored by literary types and people with B.A. degrees in philosophy or film who like to appear sophisticated without actually having to do the work of producing a defensible testable new idea.

7355270,0,t3_4g2qtp,From this Quora post linked to from the one you postedgt A pervasive problem in discussions about the hard problem is that consciousness is defined and understood in different ways by different people and if it is defined as a state of the brain then there is simply no way to coherently state the hard problem. To see the hard problem as a problem first requires one to accept a definition of consciousness as being something essentially nonphysical and that is something physical realists will not do. gt The other problem is that those who see the hard problem have trouble providing a clear definition of what exactly consciousness is and that makes it easy for their position to be dismissed by physical realists as being inherently incoherent or meaningless. For example how can the subjective experience of red be defined? If it is defined in terms of the distinction between experiences of other colors then the physical realist can map that distinction to physically distinguishable brain states and assert that what is being talked about is nothing more than that. The fundamental issue here is that subjective consciousness can not in principle be objectified. It is essentially ineffable. Proponents of the hard problem have not always seen this clearly.I think there is a mystery to subjective experience but I dont think that the hard problem of consciousness is necessarily the best way of formulating this mystery. That implies there should be a materialistic explanation of subjective experience. Why should there be? Thats a religious fundamentalists approach to materialism with Matter in place of God.The universe is very mysterious but that doesnt seem like a problem to me. Maybe some things will just always stay mysteries.,samharris,d2e8sgx,2,t5_2thqg

Hamas won the legislative election and had no candidate in the presidential. It doesnt matter if people only really voted for them because of corruption. When you vote for a party you get the whole package.gt Hamas won a narrow plurality victory and in exit polls voters said that they overwhelmingly did not like Hamass Israel policy but they did like their stance on corruption.You must know that you can find countless polls of palestinians supporting rather hideous policies visavis Israel. Even if the main reason people voted for Hamas had nothing to do with Israel and they said they wanted Hamas policy with regards to Israel to change whatever that means that still doesnt change the fact that you find absolutely shocking levels of support for violence against Israel among palestinians.gt The reason why Hamas runs Gaza today is that they illegally formed private militias and staged a coup in that part of the territory. The PA is not preventing elections from occurring. The PA has offered many reconciliation deals to Hamas which would hold new elections in a matter of months. It is Hamas who refuses to agree to new elections. Do you really think Hamas would agree that they are the ones obstructing new elections?gt All of Israels proposals so far have been well outside of the international consensus on what a fair deal should look like and have included absurd things like the annexation of East Jerusalem or  of the West Bank with no land swaps. The PA has endorsed proposals which are in line with the international consensus and Israel has refused them. This is simply untrue.

If you disagree with this then I would like to know what you think is wrong with for instance the Clintonparameters.gt And the PA is absolutely willing to compromise on the refugee issue. In  in negotiations with Peres the PAs opening bid was to limit the right of return to just  of refugees and they would return over the course of a decade. The effect on Israeli demographics would have been minimal just a . increase in the total population after a decade. That was their opening bid. I believe we have heard stories of palestinians allegedly accepting even lower numbers than that. During the Olmert negotiations it was apparently as low as .. But I dont give much for these stories about palestinian flexibility at hidden negotiations. When push comes to shove they have always rejected compromising on the right of return. Abbas has never told his people anything but this. And because there is overwhelming support among the palestinians for a right of return it seems unlikely that he even could do it and not be killed for it.gt He acted like its just a few bad apples when Israel spends billions of dollars and commits thousands of soldiers to expand the settlements across the occupied territories every single year.

Do you think this is due to the serious nature of the belief or does believing in absurdities beliefs which contradict most other beliefs necessitate a disengagement of ones humor system?  Im alluding here to the notion of humor in brain sciences as a product of a selfcorrecting errorcheck mechanism which looks for contradictions in ones conception of reality hence why surprise is funny whether in the form of punchlines the visually unexpected such as a man tripping or even tickling which only works when others do it due to the lack of expectation.I wonder how much youve contemplated this connection between lack of humor and ardent belief in the seemingly absurd and what you would add.

7393271,0,t1_d2ihs63,I think your black crime analogy is false because higher testosterone levels is not a trait inherent to black men that Im aware of. But men do objectively have high testosterone levels than women and this is probably one of the reasons why men commit more violent crimes than women. But supposing it was discovered tomorrow that men in fact do not have higher levels of testosterone  that male violence was entirely a social phenomenon. Would this render anyone who previously believed that testosterone was a causal factor for high levels of male violence to be sexist? or just ignorant? This is more analogous to your claim that Harris is sexist. I think you are right that to dismiss or discount the possibility of social factors could be belie latent sexist biases  but then we are really in the realms of mind reading. Perhaps Harris is aware of the social factors but judged them to be of less import. I think he would be wrong in this case but Im still not sure if I would go as far as to call him sexist.

7600290,0,t1_d357hce,More from the Chomsky Foucault discussion belowgtIf this hypothetical Martian were then to observe that every normal human child immediately carries out this creative act and they all do it in the same way and without any difficulty whereas it takes centuries of genius to slowly carry out the creative act of going from evidence to a scientific theory then this Martian would if he were rational conclude that the structure of the knowledge that is acquired in the case of language is basically internal to the human mind whereas the structure of physics is not in so direct a way internal to the human mind. Our minds are not constructed so that when we look at the phenomena of the world theoretical physics comes forth and we write it down and produce it thats not the way our minds are constructed.He goes ongthow is it that we are able to construct any kind of scientific theory at all? How is it that given a small amount of data its possible for various scientists for various geniuses even over a long period of time to arrive at some kind of a theory at least in some cases that is more or less profound and more or less empirically adequate? This is a remarkable fact. And in fact if it were not the case that these scientists including the geniuses were beginning with a very narrow limitation on the class of possible scientific theories if they didnt have built into their minds somehow an obviously unconscious specification of what is a possible scientific theory then this inductive leap would certainly be quite impossible just as if each child did not have built into his mind the concept of human language in a very restricted way then the inductive leap from data to knowledge of a language would be impossible.And ongtSo even though the process of lets say deriving knowledge of physics from data is far more complex far more difficult for an organism such as ours far more drawn out in time requiring intervention of genius and so on and so forth nevertheless in a certain sense the achievement of discovering physical science or biology or whatever you like is based on something rather similar to the achievement of the normal child in discovering the structure of his language that is it must be achieved on the basis of an initial limitation an initial restriction on the class of possible theories. If you didnt begin by knowing that only certain things are possible theories then no induction would be possible at all. You could go from data anywhere in any direction. If we really want to develop a theory of scientific creation or for that matter artistic creation I think we have to focus attention precisely on that set of conditions that on the one hand delimits and restricts the scope of our possible knowledge while at the same time permitting the inductive leap to complicated systems of knowledge on the basis of a small amount of data. That it seems to me would be the way to progress towards a theory of scientific creativity or in fact towards any question of epistemology.And ongtI dont think that scientific progress is simply a matter of the accumulated addition of new knowledge and the absorption of new theories and so on. Rather I think that it has this sort of jagged pattern that you describe forgetting certain problems and leaping to new theories. I think that an act of scientific creation depends on two facts one some intrinsic property of the mind another some set of social and intellectual conditions that exist. And it is not a question as I see it of which of these we should study rather we will understand scientific discovery and similarly any other kind of discovery when we know what these factors are and can therefore explain how they interact in a particular fashion the level of acquired knowledge changes social conditions changethose conditions that permit a person to think freely and break through the bonds of lets say superstitious constraint. On BehaviorismgtTake behavioural science and think of it in these contexts. If physics for example had made the assumption that you have to keep to phenomena and their arrangement and such things we would be doing Babylonian astronomy today. Whatever value it may have had in  it has no function today except constraining and limiting scientific inquiry and should therefore simply be dispensed with in the same way one would dispense with a physicist who said youre not allowed to develop a general physical theory youre only allowed to plot the motions of the planets and make up more epicycles and so on and so forth. We can agree perhaps that behaviour in some broad sense constitutes the data for the science of man. But to define a science by its data would be to define physics as the theory of meterreadings. They might talk about meterreadings and correlations between them and such things but they wouldnt ever create physical theory. We should understand the historical context in which these curious limitations developed and having understood them I believe discard them and proceed in the science of man as we would in any other domain that is by discarding entirely behaviourism and in fact in my view the entire empiricist tradition from which it evolved.Here is where Chomsky starts sounding like HarrisgtIf it is correct as I believe it is that a fundamental element of human nature is the need for creative work for creative inquiry for free creation without the arbitrary limiting effect of coercive institutions then of course it will follow that a decent society should maximise the possibilities for this fundamental human characteristic to be realised. That means trying to overcome the elements of repression and oppression and destruction and coercion that exist in any existing society. Any form of coercion or repression any form of autocratic control of some domain of existence lets say private ownership of capital or state control of some aspects of human life any such autocratic restriction on some area of human endeavour can be justified if at all only in terms of the need for subsistence or the need for survival or the need for defence against some horrible fate or something of that sort. It cannot be justified intrinsically. And I think that at least in the technologically advanced societies of the West we are now certainly in a position where meaningless drudgery can very largely be eliminated in which human beings do not have to be forced into the position of tools of cogs in the machine. There is no longer any social necessity for human beings to be treated as mechanical elements in the productive process that can be overcome and we must overcome it by a society of freedom and free association in which the creative urge that I consider intrinsic to human nature will in fact be able to realise itself in whatever way it will.And ongtThere are two intellectual tasks one and the one that I was discussing is to try to create the vision of a future just society that is to create if you like a humanistic social theory that is based if possible on some firm and humane concept of the human essence or human nature. Thats one task. Another task is to understand very clearly the nature of power and oppression and terror and destruction in our own society. Surely we must understand these facts and not only understand them but combat them. And in fact as far as ones own political involvements are concerned in which one spends the majority of ones energy and effort it seems to me that they must certainly be in that area. Still I think it would be a great shame to put aside entirely the somewhat more abstract and philosophical task of trying to draw the connections between a concept of human nature that gives full scope to freedom and dignity and creativity and other fundamental human characteristics and to relate that to some notion of social structure in which those properties could be realised. We have to be bold enough to speculate and create social theories on the basis of partial knowledge while remaining very open to the strong possibility and in fact overwhelming probability that at least in some respects were very far off the mark.And here is where Chomsky gets closest to when Harris wrote My purpose was to show that moral truths exist and that they must fall in principle if not in practice within some perhaps never to be complete understanding of the way conscious minds arise. Chomskys versiongtI think there is some sort of an absolute basisif you press me too hard Ill be in trouble because I cant sketch it outultimately residing in fundamental human qualities in terms of which a real notion of justice is grounded. I think its too hasty to characterise our existing systems of justice as merely systems of class oppression I dont think that they are that. I think that they embody systems of class oppression and elements of other kinds of oppression but they also embody a kind of groping towards the true humanly valuable concepts of justice and decency and love and kindness and sympathy which I think are real. And I think that in any future society which will of course never be the perfect society well have such concepts again which we hope will come closer to incorporating a defence of fundamental human needs including such needs as those for solidarity and sympathy and whatever. Give an argument that the social revolution that youre trying to achieve is in the ends of justice is in the ends of realising fundamental human needs. Ive never seen a child who didnt want to build something out of blocks or learn something new or try the next task. My own guess is that were safer in trusting what I hope are the fundamental human emotions of sympathy and the search for justice which may arise within a system of free association.,samharris,d36450z,1,t5_2thqg

Well certainly we have to criticize it and hope that politicians will change course. Sams thinking which aligns with my own is that when it comes to Saudi Arabia politicians also find the situation disgraceful by and large. The explanation for the weird romance is in oil and there is every reason to anticipate a change in policy once that dependency is broken. As for the other points I think we have to accept that there are different areas of focus for different thinkers. I certainly accept your points but that does not make me think we should hold back on criticizing the religion of Islam. I dont think Sam should either and I dont even think he should spend more time criticizing the US  I can listen to other people if I want that perspective. How would the world look without an islamist insurgency? I dont know but I actually think religion plays a major role in explaining the events unfolding in the middle east and the nature of US reactions to them. Does it excuse the actions taken? Probably not but I dont think anyone claims that. I havent seen many fascists posting here and certainly they dont meet with favorable replies from the regulars. I actually see a lot of healthy discussion on the topic of western culpability going on and this brings me to your initial question What is the point of criticizing islam? I think it is the most fruitful and productive way of changing the world for the better right now. Why? Because hardly anyone is doing it and there is an army of apologists ready to demonize those that do. This is not the case when it comes to criticizing western interventions. This important work and Im not being ironic here is carried out faithfully by the same army of vocal thinkers. As Chomsky has said these are also easily ignored until they take to the streets by the millions.

The amount of damage they can do to the world is much more limited. Yes Jewish people are highly influencial in the world relative to their number but they are overall pretty reasonable. They got this obsession with their holy land but it is limited to that region. As Harris said even if we were to give them British Columbia they wouldnt want it. Orthodox Judaism is certainly a problem and is not fit for modernity but secular Jewish are commited to the rule of law science the environment and all the good stuff as Harris put it.

8217743,0,t1_d52qmjb,gtBut the idea of the three dimensions isnt as vital as the illusion of free will. To realize that  d images are actually  d is fine and we can use this for our own purposes but to realize that all our thoughts and decisions are also not of our own products is pretty depressing. Let me just call your attention to the details of your comparison... You contrasted useful against depressing which cuts across purposes. That and the second half of your post betray an emotional reaction to Harriss argument akin to that of realizing that death is inevitable.So let me try to bring you down a little bit more purely in the interest of getting it all out on the table.Death.Whats the point of living? we all wonder at some point if its all going to end anyway? Well we know the religious solution to the problem to ignore it by inventing an afterlife. That works somewhat at least for the shallow thinkers but that doesnt make it true. The atheist without recourse to the fiction of an afterlife must deal with the reality of death. How do we do this? Well we begin by understanding that our time on this Earth is precious its not a queue its the main event so we can feel relief in the knowledge that we are able to appreciate life more fully. Then theres the contemplation of the state of being dead. We can understand that by imagining how we were before we were born its not an eternal lack of feeling its just nothing at all like the time you dont experience when youre sleeping. Well that doesnt seem so bad. For those who still long for immortality there is the concrete knowledge that our legacies can outlive us by a great deal in the minds of loved ones in the contributions we leave behind or in the form of our children small consolations they may seem to some but they are  real. So it seems that death may always be a bummer topic but it doesnt have to depress us.Determinism.So it turns out theres no such thing as free will. Bummer. Not only is death inevitable so was your choice of shirt this morning. It suddenly feels like your whole life has been chosen for you youre just a little ball in a big Rube Goldberg machine and if we only had the computing power to do the calculations your whole life could be mapped out including all the decisions you would ever make! So one asks whats the point of living if all my choices are made for me? Again we know a few religious solutions to the problem most of them again just ignore it. But the thinker must confront the problem headon. Id like to make two points here. First Id like you to consider what youve lost and what youve gained from this knowledge. If youre fully convinced by Harriss argument then you will have gained a new perspective on human behavior and justice. Thats good. But you also seem to have lost the sense of control you used to have over your life. Ive already tried to make the point that no matter whether your choices are determined you still have to make them staying in bed because you feel depressed by your lack of free will is still a choice that youre making... also without free will. But I always work best with metaphors so Id like to explore the phrase free will is an illusion to find out why this depresses us so.I think its that word illusion. When we think of illusion we dont think about it in the technical sense where it applies here we think of it the way magicians do. Illusions are tricks unreal things events that fool us and though it is all in good fun in the context of magical performance rob us of understanding and control. Well that certainly would make the statement free will is an illusion very depressing. But lets take a closer look at illusion in the context of magical performance...When a magician uses a force he gives the participant the illusion of control. The participant may make a choice with no real consequence like when the magician tells you to cut the deck and pick a half he knows where the target card is so when you pick your half he tells you either to keep it or throw it out. His directions are based on where the card is but you assume thats just what he would have said anyway. Or the magician may literally force the participant into making the choice he wishes like with mentalist tricks. Either way the outcome of the trick is set and nothing the participant does really matters. This is how were used to thinking of illusions but it doesnt really apply to the free will debate. First of all there is no mastermind picking the outcomes he wants and putting us on rails towards those outcomes. Nor is it true that our choices dont matter our choices are part of what determines the entire future of the universe from that point on and while they are physically determined by previous events they are certainly not predictable and not by any means subject to any higher will. So when we say free will is an illusion we should try to think of it in more abstract terms like in the way that math is an illusion or taste is an illusion. Really taste is just a set of labels your brain attaches to certain chemical detections from your nose and tongue but that doesnt make Johnny Walker Black Label any less amazing. Likewise free will is just a way of saying that there is no choicemaker higher than yourself you are the captain of your life. Knowing that it is an illusion doesnt change that.Whew!

If it cant be done then it doesnt exist.Sure I agree and moreover I think the same can be done with free will in exactly the same way and I dont see any reason why I shouldnt. All of these things are emergent properties of complex physical systems so in order to give your your atomic breakdown of them that you want for some reason all you need to do is breakdown their constituent parts.gtYouve snuck in the word ability there to mean freedom or option which is really what youre trying to define here.No sneaking here. Ability is the word I used and insofar as option or freedom are synonyms for how any competent English user would understand freedom or option or ability you can use them interchangeably if you prefer. Whatever the case thats my definition. What exactly is wrong with it? Be specific. gtThat really is not explaining it in terms of particles. Its like I ask someone to explain how the world would differ if souls didnt exist then them replying humans wouldnt exist then. Sure that explanation is consistent with your beliefs but it doesnt get any closer to explaining what souls are in terms of atomic particles.It is  your oracle would point to the particulars constituting the states of affairs where a will that would act in some way in one situation and in another way in its absence under duress was my example. If you want it explained in terms of particles then just work out for yourself what the arrangement of particles in those states of affairs would be.This is why perusing this on the particle scale is utterly senseless by the way. As I said you can certainly describe the rules of the road in terms of atoms but it is utterly senseless to do so. Exactly the same here.gtSo you wouldnt need to tell an oracle what humans are if free will is real. true but you do because you see humans not collections of particles. Its easier that way and theres no reason not to.gtYou need only tell them exactly how free will arises through particle interactions and you havent done that.Yes I have but not in terms of particles interactions because theres no reason to. If a person would not withdraw money and give it to a stranger in one case and would in another then you have a set of situations that exemplify what a person wants to do what they do not want to do and what makes them do what they do not will. If you want particles convert that set of affairs to particles. Theres no reason to because your approach is senseless.gtI dont think I really understand what you mean when you say will in the context of defining free will as the ability of a subject to act according to their will. Not clear why your trying to argue about compatibilism lolgtBecause Im just reading it as desires. And if that is true then a computer algorithm that calculates the shortest path between two points then takes that path could have free will because nothing is stopping it from taking the path. Is that right?Willings can pretty much be used interchangeably with choices but I dont really know anything about Phil and computers. As far as I know compatibilists would argue that computers dont have the capability of choosing otherwise I.e we cant conceive of a programmed system having done other than taking the shortest path as it was programmed to do. Whereas with a person choosing whether or not to follow instructions during a mugging we can conceive of the subject having refused the mugger and being shot as a result even if that isnt the rational course of action and the course of action that wed expect given broad biological selfpreservation instincts. Their choose is still determined somehow were assuming but obviously thats not a problem outright for compatibilists,samharris,d55dykn,1,t5_2thqg

8269687,0,t1_d5b8jov,I am not and have never been insulted by you calling me an interested layman. Moreover i am an interested layman and my only claim to a knowledge base is my degree in philosophy and the fact that i continue to read philosophy and engage with actual philosophers on philosophical matters and occasionally also with other academics. I have amply demonstrated basic knowledge in other threads which Harris has amply demonstrated he lacks and this is one axis of my point that Harris resembles an interested layman with a nonetheless understandable if unjustified popular appeal. However i am insulted by your claim that i am being dishonest given that such a claim has heretofore not been properly substantiated. What is even more galling is that your inadequate substantiation of this runs to the not argued for claim that because i expressed the opinions that i hold my substantiations of which you have not adequately responded to see for example the straw man affair that i therefore must be blinded by prejudice. The nail in the coffin is that you a fail to respond to my accusation of hypocrisy in this regard and b that you continue to hold that having doubts as to your philosophical pedigree which i do not claim to be a discreditation of your views even as i retracted the original insulting claim that i am somehow being dishonest.I will note on this point that your claim to be giving me the straw man claim back was inherently dishonest given that you only justify that by claiming that such a conversation would not be productive which amounts to suggesting that we leave the issue aside. That is obviously not the same thing as retreating from the straw man claim and saying that it is is exactly the hypocrisy and therefore further dishonesty on your part which you continue to fail to respond to.To be accused of dishonesty even as you retract any dishonest claims is not only insulting it is doubly insulting to be so accused by somebody who refuses to respond to your own detractions or substantations of said claims particularly if you are clearly doing your level best to be as honest and as forthright as possible and particularly if the only substantations that you are given for the claim that you are dishonest rely both on the accusers failure to read what you say and the vague heuristic without further substantiation that simply to hold the views you do indicates dishonesty by itself alone.,samharris,d5b9pcl,2,t5_2thqg

Thats obviously an extremely difficult task and I can see why people are frustrated but there are no shortcuts. The journalist Greg Palast wrote an article about what people should do going forwardgtI got this idea of what Bernie and Berners should do from Satan from the AntiChrist. Or as you might know him from television the Reverend Pat Robertson. Thats correct the berzerko right wing televangelist. As Robertson and his minions explained it the race gave him a list of three million names addresses phone numbers  and millions in nonstop donations. From that list of believers and their bodies and checkbooks Robertson created the fearsome Christian Coalition. And for two decades no one could run for dogcatcher on the Republican line without the endorsement of Reverend Pats Christian Coalition. Sanders himself has always said his campaigns moral purpose was not to win the nomination and surely he must have known the DNC couldnt permit that. And ongtIn the union movement we used to say Dont mourn organize! Now imagine if next year a Sanders UnChristian Coalition made up of  million voters announced that it will throw its endorsement to the Green Party in the midterms if a President Clinton suddenly decides that the TransPacific trade deal is now acceptable. Imagine if the future Sanders organization could echoing the Christian Coalitions takeover of the GOP push progressive Dems over the top in key Congressional races. To win over Sanders voters Hillary Clinton made an awful lot of promises. If theres one thing a politician hates more than full disclosure of their donors its an informed organized and activated voter. Especially one multiplied by a million.But people should be frustrated with lesser evilism for the reasons that Matt Taibbi explainedgtThe problem with this line of thinking is that theres no end to it. If you think I owe you my vote because I recycle and enjoyed To Kill a Mockingbird youre not going to work very hard to keep it. Thats particularly true if the only standard you think you need to worry about is not being worse than Donald Trump. This is why the thinking within the Democratic Party has gotten so flabby over the years. The party gets most of its funding without having to beg for it door to door and it gets many of its votes by default. The crazier the Republicans get the more reflexive will be the arguments that we cant afford any criticism of Democrats. Voters dont want candidates who agree with them about everything. They just want one who isnt going to completely take them for granted.The only argument Ive seen against lesser evilism that has any plausibility I dont agree with it its too risky IMO is this onegtIf my vote will impact the outcome of the election I may have to decide which matters more a the differences between a bad Democrat and worse Republican over the next four years or b the degree to which Id undermine our chances to enact fundamental change to a broken political system in the longrun by pursuing a lesseroftwoevils voting strategy. Its hard for me to see how we will ever fix our political process and reclaim our democracy by refusing to draw some lines in the sand. An open commitment to support a lesseroftwoevils candidate robs voters of bargaining power. I acknowledge that a lot of the Republicans are really scary that my strategy isnt guaranteed to work the way I think it will and that people evaluate the risks differently than I do.He discusses this dynamic in a recent articlegtAs one Republican strategist has explained many Sanders supporters have already shown by and large that theyll fall in line and back Clinton despite policy positions they dislike. The loss of bargaining power that pledging to vote for Clinton entails is also apparent in pressure from Wall Street about Clintons choice of a running mate moderate Democrats in the financial services industry argue that Sanders voters will come on board anyway and that Clinton does not need to pick Elizabeth Warren to help her win. Some Sanders supporters like the candidate himself have already decided that a united front against Trump is more important than that leverage. A mostly unconditional commitment to party unity comes at the expense of leverage over the partys direction and theres no denying that.The very smart James Kwack explains the risks and why he like Rob Reich will also vote for HRCgtConservatives have better fundraising and training networks more motivated local activists e.g. people running for school board so they can stamp out evolution and just more money. Its a cause of the very first picture because Republicans have translated control of state governments into Congressional gerrymandering. In  for example Democratic House candidates received more votes than their Republican opponents yet the Republicans ended up with a majority by more than thirty seats. The entire political system has been tilted more in the Republicans favor to the point where the presidency is the only prize that Democrats can fight for on equal terms.And ongtThink about the situation that puts us in. Republicans are apoplectic at the idea that Hillary Clinton could appoint the deciding justice to the Supreme Court but the smart ones realize that she will be able to accomplish little else even if by some miracle Democrats retake the House Republican unity will suffice to block anything in the Senate. Democrats by contrast are terrified because a Republican president means that they will get virtually everything unless the Senate Democratic caucus somehow develops a backbone which it certainly didnt have under George W. Bush not just the Supreme Court but a flat tax new abortion restrictions Medicaid block grants repeal of DoddFrank repeal of Obamacare Medicare vouchers and who knows what else.And ongtWhats the lesson here? It isnt that Bernie Sanders could accomplish more than Hillary Clinton in four years against dugin Republican opposition. He couldnt. Its that having a president isnt enough. We need a movement. Thats what the conservatives have had for decades embryonic in the s quixotic in the s on the rise in the s ascendant in the s and increasingly institutionalized entrenched and ideologically extreme ever since. We need to stop thinking that winning the presidency more often than not is a longterm strategy. What were doing isnt working. I wouldnt call Hillary Clinton the lesser evil. She isnt evil. I think she will be a decent president except when it comes to foreign military intervention.And ongtShe will more or less hold the line against conservative extremists for at least four years. And of course it will be nice to join the ranks of civilized countries that have chosen women as their leaders. But shes the candidate of the Democratic status quo and the Democratic status quo isnt working. We need to do something different. We can have a debate about what that is. I think we need two things comprehensive electoral reform which is why I supported Larry Lessig in this election and a wave of unabashedly ideological candidates who push the overall debate to the left.

9290334,0,t1_d8ssba9,gt The way you characterize this its almost like youre implying it happened spontaneously. Of course anyone with even a passing knowledge of politics in the Middle East understands that these movements are at least in part a reaction to the failures of secular nationalism which was heavily influenced by the wars against Israel and political intervention by US. The idea of a revolution is that it is revolutionary. But of course the revolution did not come out of nowhere and it certainly had something to do with the failure of the previous secular regimes. However I dont see how any of that is relevant to my argument. My point is that the influence of religion in the middle east has drastically increased in modern times and it has become overtly political.gt Your starting point of  is arbitrary. It conveniently allows you to ignore the proper context to understand any of these developments so you can just label it as Islam. But even then your caveat of modern undermines any attempt to attribute this kind of violence to anything inherent to Islam. And this is to say nothing of the tremendous task of accounting for the vastly different histories and cultures of these Islamic countries to single out the influence of religion. Why do you call it arbitrary? Do you not think that  was a watershed moment for the region? Can you find me scholar of Islam who consideres the events of that year unimportant?You seem to have this idea that religion must this immutable and static entity. That people never reinterpret their scriptures and that emphasis they place on religion is always the same. That is what you must believe if the absence of religious suicide bombing before the s is to disprove religion as a causal influence.What I am claiming is that Islam has changed in modern times. The role of religion is increased all over the middle east  especially in politics. Salafist movements who have become enormously popular are advocating a return the sources of Islam and the problem is that in Islamic scripture you find not just a justification for holy war and martyrdom but an explicit recommendation.In any case my main point is that I do not believe the absence of suicide terror prior to  can refute the theory that the current terror has its roots in religion. That could only be the case if religion was a truely immutable and static entity which it is demonstrably not.And back to Papes theory.gt This is puzzling. So you want umrsamsa to essentially write your argument for you? At this point I freely admit that I do not understand Papes theory. I simply need to have the theory explained to me in terms of how you can test it. Of what exactly constitutes evidence for and against the theory.Pape claims that his theory explains  of suicide terrorist attacks. So what exactly is the deal with those remaining ? What distinguishes them from the rest? I dont know what he is talking about here. Can you help me out?This is not me asking you to write my argument. This is my asking whether or not you even understand the theory you claim to defend. Remember that a theory that explains everything explains nothing. The idea in social science is that you come up with a model that is capable of making testable predictions of events in the world. A model is never supposed to account for everything. If it did it would become enormously complex and thus impossible to test.gt Now lets actually examine Papes argument. He attributes the decline of suicide terrorism in Iraq togt  the moderation of underlying sources of ethnic tension  the empowerment of local groups encouraging them to abandon support for terrorism and of course  withdrawal of foreign combat troops on an orderly schedule signaling the imminent independence of the central government.gt If you check back with what I wrote before you can see that the loss of  and  coincide with the resurgence of suicide terrorism. You are of course right about the fact that this is what Pape says about the decline in suicide terrorism. But my question remains What does those two reasons have to do with foreign occupation?You seem to make the general mistake of thinking that I am arguing that Pape doesnt have any explanations for the various suicide campaigns. He most certainly does. But my point is that his explanations do not justify his overall theory of foreign occupation  let alone provide evidence for it.,samharris,d8tm7bd,1,t5_2thqg

9418052,0,t1_d99cv2z,Lets not mince words here. At the end of the day profiling and antiprofiling are both just using statistics and what we already know to narrow search ranges when screening for terrorists. Things like gender age ethnicity behavior patterns clothing and a bunch of other demographics are all likely to be statistically significant. In other words putting greater scrutiny into say male over female passengers will likely yield better results in catching terrorists compared to a nonweighted random screening.As a passenger falls within more and more of these higher risk demographics we should probably apply more and more scrutiny to the passenger relative to others who do not. When we combine all the higher risk demographics what we might end up with are indeed some ethnicity or kind of people who would receive the greatest attention at airport security.If Sam followed his reasoning to its logical conclusion which Im sure he has then he must realize this too. I think the reason he hasnt made the point explicit is because it would make his position that much more vulnerable to misrepresentation and oneliner attacks from people who arent interested in reasoning. In the end Sam is arguing for profiling because it is pragmatic but he avoids saying so because profiling is a poisonous word in our current politically correct climate.On my own position  I imagine screening based on statistics is likely the most pragmatic approach we can take. However at the same time it might not be the most fair. I would be willing to explore an argument that suggests improved effectiveness of airport security isnt worth the tradeoff of unfairly inconveniencing certain demographics of people. In what little thought Ive put into the above counter argument Ive mostly dismissed it because the alternative to special inconvenience to certain groups would be equal inconvenience to everyone as the topic is about security resource allocation and not whether or not security screening exist. If someone is going to spend an extra  minutes getting questioned it might as well be the person most likely a terrorist.,samharris,d99sxgo,2,t5_2thqg

The vicious criticism and noplatforming that she has received from some on the left and I emphasize some has been totally unfair. But frankly in the past her rhetoric has been ridiculously over the top. The comments that shes made about the Muslim community  saying that the entirety Islam must be destroyed by the West saying that the all of Islam is a death cult saying that they are an enemy that must be crushed  is not the kind of dialogue that informs rational productive discussion about reform within Islam. Having said that Im glad that she seems to be moderating her positions as of late. As Max Rodenbeck put it Ayaan has begun to mellow and no longer completely rejects Islam. Her most recent book made the argument that moderates within the Middle East ought to be empowered which I agree is an important step.But there was one specific comment in the interview that I took issue with. At  she says It is no longer safe to be a woman in the public sphere in Europe.Seriously? Thats some of the most extreme hyperbole Ive heard in quite some time.

That would rule out calling black people niggers for starters. And I agree that theres a difference when it comes to speech thats directed at an individual with the intention of harassing or abusing that individual. I dont think Milo actually directed anything too unreasonable at Leslie Jones but perhaps I havent got the full story. Theres also a difference between communication within a workplace and communication on a worldwide platform that is designed for communication.gtRichard Dawkins for example was prevented from speaking at a university because someone deemed him to be offensive in one way or another. I find that absurd.gtThis is wrong. No arguments from me. But it has nothing to do with Twitter.It has something to do with freespeech. People like me and you it seems think that Dawkins should have a platform. Some people disagree. Where does one draw the line? Dawkins can be provocative at times. Someone like Hitchens perhaps more so. Some people would argue that Hitchens created unnecessary animus and should therefore not be given a platform. Harris has been provocative at times. Who decides where to draw the line? The idea of free speech is to leave the whole thing open because nobody can be entrusted with the responsibility of making that decision. Milo of course is nothing more than a provocateur but I still think he should have the right to express his opinions.gtExcept Twitter allows white supremacists to have accounts too. Let me simplify this for you. There are white Supremacist black supremacist and Islamic supremacist accounts. Twitter allows most of them to exist because of your absolute free speech stuff and this leads to the usual herr durr they let those blacks say whatever they want.Youre missing my point it was just an example. The point was that there are people doing worse than Milo who havent been banned.gtWhere Twitter draws the line is abuse. Personal abuse is not tolerated. When thousands of accounts target one users and the commonality is that the thousands of accounts follow one account and these targeted attacks occur over and over again it is obvious that one account is responsible for the coordination.Sure but what did Milo actually say to Leslie Jones and was it more offensive that the kind of stuff that millions of people get away with every day? What I read seemed pretty unremarkable. The real problem was that his followers abused Leslie Jones. As you may have noticed recently Sam tried to shake off the altright pepe crowd a group of people who probably represent the overlap between Sam and Milos followers. If they start to direct abuse at anyone Sam happens to get entangled with is it reasonable to ban Sam? And banning Milo doesnt even fix the problem all of the abusive followers probably still have their accounts and probably still troll people routinely.,samharris,d9n8wel,4,t5_2thqg

End of story.  gt Im defending him because I like absolute free speech.Im only going to say this one more time.  Absolute free speech does not entitle you a platform especially not a private platform owned by someone else. If someone comes on to your lawn and starts yelling about how bad Jews are are you just going to sit back and say hell yeah free speech or are you going to kick him out?  At the very least do you understand why other reasonable people would assert their right to kick him out?This isnt so hard to understand and I dont understand why you continue to dance around this.  Twitter is a product.  Trolls diminish the value of the product.  People like Milo make other users less likely to use the product.  Twitter is perfectly within its rights to protect their multibillion dollar product.I dont care whether you like or dislike Islam.

It is about rights not science. It is an affirmation of basic treatment all humans are entitled to regardless of whether they are a Superman or a stupid morally repugnant genetically deformed thing of a man.The idea that we should take active steps to make white people a greater percentage of the American population than they currently are is a direct denial of that affirmation.

9604273,0,t3_5cebnf,Probably. Sort of maybe.The thing to realise is that using AI doesnt mean appealing to some qualitatively distinct automated prediction machine. It has been written about ad nauseum for example that neural networks are identical to just a load of nonlinear regression models all tied together. And they are as curated if not more so than existing statistical methodologies. In other words AI is just another item in the tool box which will be used more as we get better at using it. In the same way all the pollsters will already being using and contrasting many distinct techniques at the moment. Its incidentally this reason why even accepting Sams argument on this I perhaps incorrectly cant get myself to seriously worry about any scenario even approaching the singularity. Our AIs at this point are just tools used incorrectly or on the wrong things they just fall over or simply do nothing. There has been zero progress in general AI since it was conceived.I am however open to the idea there are real problems round the corner due to making better tools that will put people out of jobs eg self driving cars.

9624099,0,t1_d9zbcv8,I would argue that the bias cant extend to levels of intelligence or empathy that we cannot perceive. So maybe I need to revise my statement.

But if we just gleaned that they were highly intelligent for example if they appeared to be lifeless blobs but issued auditory beeps that somehow answered the most difficult mathematical questions we would be leery of valuing them too highly. I think. Even that is a pretty direct display of intelligence.

Yes being deranged I might get a momentary thrill from being cruel to a defenseless animal but at what price? Do my kids love me? Am I even capable of loving them? What rewarding experiences in life am I missing? Intentions matter because they color our minds in every moment. They also determine much of our behavior and thereby affect the lives of other people.

It is quite possible for a bad person to inadvertently do some good in the world. But the inner and outer consequences of our thoughts and actions seem to account for everything of value here.

Why also put the shackles on still growing economies for what only the West is responsible.Should we carbon tax private individuals and public companies equally? If not why not? What is true here?

He focuses on the need to be able to discuss Islam honestly rather than proposing practical solutions.Though at the same time perhaps it is the unfair to ask Sam tackle the whole problem on his own and I am sure he would tell you that he thinks more honest conversation will better enable society as a whole to find a workable solution.,samharris,daya6kq,1,t5_2thqg

Here I am a week ago getting dogpiled in rbadphilosophy though I did get a bunch of upvotes so the readers opinions are presumably more divided than the opposition I got in the comments suggests for complaining about people putting scare quotes around doctorate and neuroscientist when they refer to Harris behavior which I characterize as farcical and as motivated by a merely reflexive dislike for the man. Which is its a funny coincidence the very stupidity you wanted to hold me responsible for!And honestly when I get in those arguments theres a voice in my head saying Hold on this guys fans have called you every abusive name under the sun and when they behave like little monsters the only people who are going to have your back are the people youre about to piss off in this argument. Is this really something you want to do? And my answer is you can see for yourself Yes because its the right thing to do.

People in high crime areas are more likely to be stopped. If there are high crime areas that are black areas then yes youll be more likely to be stopped there.Now if its true that a black person in a low crime nonblack area will be stopped with more zeal then I concede that you could call that bias. But I dont think its necessarily a very meaningful use of the word bias. Marq Claxton defined it as it suited him but thats not necessarily how the word is understood by most people and why should he get to define the terms of the motion? The first definition that Google threw up was inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group especially in a way considered to be unfair.dictionary.cambridge.org says the action of supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an unfair way because of allowing personal opinions to influence your judgmentwww.merriamwebster.com says an inclination of temperament or outlook especially   a personal and sometimes unreasoned judgmentI think that when we discuss racial bias in policing most people are imagining a definition that includes unfairness. Theres a reason why people are more concerned about the racial bias in policing than the gender bias. If we feel like the bias is fair then it doesnt seem very concerning. Marq knew he couldnt win against that definition so he defined it to suit his argument. I think its telling that he felt he had to keep reminding people not to interpret the word bias the way they intuitively would.,samharris,dcdm0jb,2,t5_2thqg

I fail to see how you can classify his foreign policy legacy as anything other than a success.it seems like a lot of ppl does not want to accept this and instead judge him in some imaginary world where he had free hands and a great starting point.

10410888,0,t1_dco0lw7,I dont think so.  When I say Sam is being pragmatic I mean in the philosophical sense.  Yes he may not be entirely aware of it himself as he seems to think he can answer the isought problem but if you ignore his confusion on that point hes really espousing a pragmatism which is that science be used to find what works for us and our wellbeing which of course is often based on our past and our evolutionary adaptations and it is certainly based on looking within at our subjective experience but it doesnt throw away scientific tools that can help.  That is pragmatism.  Its not dependent on reaching the Truth but rather the next best truth to what we currently know about.  That is philosophical pragmatism and its got little in common with traditionalism.,samharris,dco545h,1,t5_2thqg
10419432,0,t1_dcp32je,gt I think it is completely obvious that at the present moment the vast majority of people are not remotely interested in rational discussion.Then new evidence isnt going to change anything for them.Heres the way I see it bigots and irrational people are going to do what theyre going to do.  Theres already plenty of research material to use correctly or incorrectly to make the case for race differences.  Not enough to convince intellectuals apparently but this danger of the masses misusing information if in fact they are misusing it is already happening. So the only thing further research is going to change is the conversation among people are willing to have a rational discussion.  If the masses misunderstand fine theyre doing that already at least then itll be closer to the truth.If youre worried about having nothing left to say to bigots instead of the mantra being differences within a race are greater than those without push a new narrative like differences between races as a groups do not apply to every individual in that group.,samharris,dcp40f2,2,t5_2thqg
10419495,0,t1_dcone2d,Also it makes less sense to focus on narrow phentotypical differences and how they correlate with IQ why race instead height for example? when we could easily use those efforts and resources to identify the genotypical differences.  When we understand the genetic link to IQ that information could be easily extrapolated to race gender height sexual orientation lung capacity penis size.... whatever your fancy is.  You could correlate any phenotypical difference you desire with IQ once the genetic component was fully understood.  But if instead you focused your race on just one of these differences you at best would only get some hints as to what the possible genetic link would be.

10431345,0,t3_5pbb9o,So beyond his delightful defiance of the transrights nuts I dont really know anything about Peterson.  But reading between the lines of a couple of things he and Sam said at the very outset it sounds to me like they anticipated disagreement on religions place in determining truth.  I kinda suspect Peterson may be claiming a version of a nonoverlapping magisteria argument based on things he said about isought.  It sounds like hes saying that religious inquiry can lead to ought conclusions that are pragmatically superior to purely realistic approaches.   I think thats why he stuck so hard on this point he relies on it to carve out any room for religion to stay in the game.Since they didnt get that far I wont comment on that Ill just say that I find Petersons notion of truth to be annoyingly fluffy and typical of philosophy.  One obvious implication is that facts cant exist without consciousness Im sure philosophy has a name for that but I have no idea what it is.  It seems like a statement that isnt falsifiable and if you grant it as true it leads to immediately absurd conclusions like prime numbers not being prime until someone defines them as such.  I tweeted him saying that under this definition birdshot is true for humans but false for passenger pigeons.  Its craziness and I dont see how the conversation can get past this point.

10445683,0,t3_5pebzw,As a comp.sci grad I found it very difficult to extract Jordans position on truth.  In fact it wasnt until Jordan provided the example of the house fire that I partially latched on to his position.My takeaway is that he thinks that truth is valid if all unknowns are known.   He seems to think that reality is  undefined and that its only when we establish micro artificial conditions that a truth can be known.  Thats fine I can accept that point thats how computers work   or NULL but what I dont understand is how morality has anything to do with it.   Perhaps Im wrong about his assertion that morality is connected with truth but thats not what I took away from the conversation. Why does he wrap the very nature of the universe inside an envelope of morality when morality is something we invented and nothing more.  He kept rejecting all of Sams points for being far too narrow in focus and yet Sam kept needlessly pressing in the direction of morality.  I almost ended with a headache at that point and it wasnt the wine.  Perhaps I missed it but I really wanted Sam to just ask if Jordan if he thought truth can exist without morality.  Sam tried to engage with more macro examples but Jordan didnt consider them to be macro enough.  At that point I realized that no truth comparison Sam could ask would ever be macro enough.  I suspect that a question like Can truth exist in a universe void of life?  would most likely spawn multiple universes....   ,samharris,dcs3qrw,2,t5_2thqg

Realism wants to assert ontological facts but base on ????  I need that blank filled in.  But as far as I can see at the end of the day the difference is an epistemological and methodological one.  Ontology is.  There are facts of the matter to know and be right or wrong about.  The question is how do we find out and how do we know what we know?  Pragmatism is an epistemological approach.Correct me if Im wrong Im asserting whats in my head not necessarily saying I know here and it doesnt feel ridiculous to point this out .,samharris,dct477q,1,t5_2thqg

It says there is no difference from facts and values where values are determined by their functional utility. Truth itself is determined by functional utility. Truth in realism just is what it is truth in pragmatism are those claims which are the most useful. These are different ontological positions. Youre right that the knowledge is what we should believe is an epistemological statement.The paper is talking about pop social ontology and international relations.

10457644,0,t3_5pdn6a,It seems to me that the version of the word true or truth which Jordan is advocating would never be able to be used other than to talk about the word itself and how confusing and useless it is. It is literally impossible to ever know whether something is true or not if the word basically asks the question do humans survive forever as a result? I DONT KNOW!Essentially the word functions as a factor of time and for some reason human survival. So you can never know what is true.You can also never know what is true because it would be impossible to pinpoint exactly what led to human extinction to begin with. It could be that  years ago Jimmy at the old stone quarry by the river near the barn smashed his thumb while swinging away at the rocks which in turn lead him to walk back home and run into Jerry who told him about Stella. By and by Jimmy and Stella had a baby. They raised that baby well enough but it had a rough life. That baby killed a man one day. The aftermath of that event evolved over time like a butterfly effect until one day because Jimmy smashed his thumb humans went extinct. But why stop at Jimmy? we could go back even further and blame a prior thing that lead jimmy to have to be in the stone quarry in the first place.So it would be impossible to know what thing was true and what wasnt because you cant know what the main cause of the extinction of humanity would be. There are an infinite number of possibilities. It is easy to see the end result or even the immediate thing which caused that thing but it becomes an infinite regress of possible causes.Also If humans did survive into infinity does that make everything true?Further suppose Bears are eating humans.This would be both true and result in human suffering and extinction. Would Jordan posit that in a hypothetical afterlife for the sake of the argument after humans went extinct that it is not true that they were eaten by bears?Another questionFor what epistemological reason are we determining that truth is contingent on the survivability of humanity and not on some other conscious beings? is it assumed that we are concerned with all conscious beings in determining truth or just humans? clearly neanderthals arent around anymore and I would assume they were conscious considering the fact that homo sapiens and neanderthals were closely related enough to interbreed and it was not so long ago. There is no reason to assert that truth be contingent on the well being of any single organism any more than humans. It seems to me to be an arbitrary measure of truthvalue. it is too subjective. How can you argue that the survivability of any organism is more important than any other and thus impinge truth on that opinion. It seems either arrogant or subjective and also seems to have far less practical applications than the word normally provides like it is true that I wrote that on my laptop.Yet the strongest argument against this idea of using the word true or truth in this weird way is instead of providing us with something beneficial or enlightening or valuable we end up on reddit rambling about a needless change to a basic word. there are over  words in the English language and even a combination of a few of them to mean something else so why waste time changing one when we can simply find one that already fits the definition were looking for or combine it with another word to mean the same thing? It seems completely avoidable and confusing and only useful for exactly that confusing people.There is a better way to achieve your goals Jordan.Another scenarioHumans are doing all things well and good such that humans would survive forever happily even. Then an intelligent extraterrestrial civilization discovers that humans may well soon impinge on their own the extraterrestrials survivability and happiness as a result of the fact that their the humans technological advancements are becoming increasingly more complex and powerful as well as the fact that they will potentially survive forever as well as the fact that they are apes and as such are emotional greedy selfish and at worst homicidal. So they determine that the best course of action is to begin wiping us out. How do we talk about truth in this context? Is it fair or useful to tell another intelligent non human lifeform capable of wiping us out that truth depends on only human survival? Further why could it not be that these other intelligent beings are more worthy of this definition of truth and the import of their survivability supersedes our own? In other words who are we to say that humans are above all other beings which i feel that this word is implying.Another problemIt seems to me that the only usefulness of the word truth in this way are in very limited and specific scenarios. Whats the point then? Cant we just tell people that just because something is objectively true doesnt mean that it is objectively good or useful to humans?Another asideIf what is true results in humans surviving but all other lifeforms on the planet going extinct assuming we have the technology to stay alive without the rest of the other animal species then is it really good? can we not say that what is true may be synonymous with what would be purely selfish? Complete disregard for all other forms of life? In other words would you advocate that burning fossil fuels until all of the polar bears and coral reefs and various other organisms die off and the levels of greenhouse gasses in the ecosystem reach a critical massesque level from which there is no feasible return but humans survive into eternity anyways then is this good? EVEN IF indefinite survival could have been achieved WITHOUT wiping out all other forms of life? It would still be true according to this definition that we should have done these things or made these decisions simply because humans survive. not to mention the possibly abysmal depression that the remaining people on the planet may be in as a result of selfdisgust for wiping out everything good and beautiful on earth besides ourselves resulting in suicides and such well say.I just see little to no utility in speaking this way. And Im probably wrong about a few things here as a result of an incorrect interpretation of what Jordan is saying no fault of my own I think we can agree but these are my thoughts. I realize that Jordan wants to use the word true in a way that will keep people happy or something but really? is it necessary or practical to approach the problem in this way?,samharris,dcth8vr,2,t5_2thqg

I have a solution to the HP but honestly I think many others do too... they just havent spelled it out yet in such a form to convince many or the intended audience simply is just presently impossible to convince for whichever reason.As for Peterson he does believe in HP.  He didnt mention HP directly but he believes its impossible to explain subjective experience through any form of physicalism.  He often laughs condescendingly when talking about it as if its absurd to believe otherwise.  I dont doubt he believes in the possibility of philosophical zombies.

Something like the Truth is whatever we think it is if it increases our Darwinian success. One is a statement about our limited ability to ascertain truth. The other is a statement about truth itself and how it is defined by our limited evolved abilities.... or something. It gets a bit handwavy.

Yes because you dont know whats true and there is a risk if it is true that the snake is capable of harming you.We ultimately dont know whats going to happen from one moment to the next. We behave based on analysis of the environment and predicting likely outcomes. We must operate based on widelyacknowledged subjective truths in order to survive. One can I believe must hold subjective truths simultaneously with a rational objective view of the world. Lets take a much broader example human life. The idea of human life having objective value is absurd because value is necessarily subjective. We dont matter in a cosmic sense. But then who am I to say that your life does not matter?

Religion includes many disciplines hence the wide range of backgrounds of those in the debate. gtNot only is this not empirically true you literally made up the  figure but its not even in the ballpark of reasonable. And this misses the point that you cannot make specific claims about a religion. There is not such thing as Christianity. A person might identify themselves as Christian but that literally tells you almost nothing about what they believe. For example Jehovahs Witnesses dont believe Jesus is god.I think the correct approach is when possible attack the beliefs as they are presented to you. More broadly you have to keep your criticism broad and specify the doctrine you are attacking acknowledging that your criticism only applies to people that believe that doctrine.For example you can criticize the notion in Islam that apostasy is a crime but that doesnt mean you should just assume  of Muslims believe that or act like they do. You can of course criticize specific groups that demonstrably show that they believe that like ISIS.I wasnt referring to extremism I should have made that clear. The point of the comparison  and I notice you have not attempted to reply to it  was to show that for example when Hitchens is talking about theists being a slave to idolatry he is talking about  of theists since that is what religion means to  of them due to the very words written in the texts. Johnston and Peterson agree but then change the definition of religion completely such that it is no longer comparable to what Hitchens is criticising. Its the definition of a strawman and also an ad hominem. ,samharris,ddcad5n,0,t5_2thqg

First you uncritically assume that the distribution of intelligence measured by I.Q. score is not only approximately modeled by a normal distribution in the relevant area of interest but that it is identical to a normal distribution. This is already shown wrong by simply realizing that we cannot obtain negative scores by standard I.Q. measurements. Then you write The region under a Gaussian distribution is unbounded which is incorrect or wrong wrong wrong end of story in your words. The area under any PDF is . Thats Statistics.Then you say that if you take the integral from x to infinity of the Gaussian distribution the definite integral will be greater than  which is true but inconsequential since intelligence is only approximately distributed normally see above. Dont confuse the map with the territory. Thats Modeling.Now in the gist of the argument you are right that focusing on outliers alone doesnt tell you too much about the relative location of two distributions but you are  wrong to say that it doesnt tell you anything even if you have two normal distributions on your hand.

10754822,0,t1_ddnlfbk,gt I dont understand the benefit of redefining truth as something that is apparently plastic like this. It would be much easier to proceed to an interesting discussion by maintaining the well understood definition of truth and offering another term for what he is calling truth.But I dont think this way of proceeding is consistent with Petersons position. This is I think the same sort of approach which I object to as a mischaracterization in the final part of the OP.Petersons advocacy of what he calls Darwinian truth isnt an attempt to redefine the word truth i.e. to redefine the word so it no longer means what he calls Newtonian truth. Rather his point is that there isnt any such thing as Newtonian truth or at least none which human beings have any access to.This is the point of what he and Harris keep calling an epistemological or even more broadly an ontological issue. Peterson thinks the idea of Newtonian truth is based on a mistaken understanding of epistemology and ontology to put it a bit more simply he thinks the idea of Newtonian truth is based on a mistaken understanding of how human beings are in contact with the world how the beliefs of human beings relate to what Ive called in the OP appropriating a Kantian term thingsinthemselves.So he cant without abandoning his position leave the word truth meaning Newtonian truth and introduce a new term to describe Darwinian truth. Or if he did this what hed have to say is that there isnt any such thing as truth i.e. leaving it to mean the Newtonian sense that no human claims are true. But the pragmatist idea he is developing here isnt meant to be a rejection of the whole idea of truth its just meant to be an argument that traditional concepts of truth have made some mistakes. So he thinks the Darwinian sense of truth is preserving some of what we want from a truth concept while correcting the mistakes the Newtonians had made.,samharris,ddpa1hx,3,t5_2thqg

People might disagree with what exactly equal means but lets bracket that.The war on drugs disproportionately affects black people and therefore is one of the forces that contributes to racial inequality. This is one of the reasons that the war on drugs is bad or at least it is an example of a bad consequence and that should be recognized. But according to the person youre responding to recognizing this is identity politics. Which is bad.Edit Another example is stopandfrisk. Its simply a fact that this is a policy that affects black people way more than white people a black person minding their own business is way more likely to be bothered by the police than a white person minding their own business.

For starters Arafat was a critic of Israels settlements and the general policy but it did not preclude him from engaging in peace talks. On the other side of the spectrum you see Israel completely halting and dismantling certain settlements under Sharon circa  but that did not play out the way anyone wanted it to...Then consider that the Palestinian territories never existed independently i.e. they were occupied by Jordan Syria Egypt or administered by the British since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The point being that the policy itself does not seem to indicate based on past precedent that peace talks cannot be had. Lastly I suggest taking a gander at the  camp david summit.

They make something trivial to them into a big problem twist the narrative into focusing on that problem so people will give them stuff or help them or protect them. They pretend to be a victim so they can make other people do things for them.I used to be a SJW i used to think in those terms and i used to hold empathy as the hibhest standard but not anymore because it doesnt work. It helps the really bad people the most and the people that needs help the least.For example a former friend of mine pretends to be sick so people will help him. He came to town with a cast on his ankle and crutches complained that he couldnt clean his appartment and it was so unfair. So he had two friends come over to his place and help him clean his appartment. Later that evening he had a party in his appartment then they went out to a pub where he danced without a crutch or a cast seems very dishonest to me.Personally i think that the SJW has taken empathy too far and twisted into something evil.,samharris,de2t9lo,4,t5_2thqg

10932333,0,t1_de6lzyu,I think reading it once through would give you insight enough as to whether or not the book is worth the attention it receives.  I dont think the Bible stands up to that test have read it several times and studied it quite a bit I would say the overwhelming majority of the Bible is boring ancient literature at best with small traces of history.  The only reason I would recommend anyone pay attention to it is simply because of its cultural significance not anything related to the content itself.  The King James Version of the Bible does often contain very poetic and beautiful language  but if thats all you are looking for there are way better sources.  Full disclaimer I have not read the Quran cover to cover.  But my assessment of it so far is comparable to the Bible.  Without religion it would likely be a forgotten book among the overwhelming majority of people that are into literature.  I find the book less impressive than the Bible on virtually any topic that I might find value in save some distinct small historical value it has and completely ignoring the cultural impact it has had.  The Bible and Quran are only interesting because of the influence it has had and continues to have on societies and cultures.  But in isolation I think the books would be better served collecting dust in libraries only ever being read by narrowly focused historians and academics.  There is so much ancient literature that does stand on its own that I think think should in an ideal world take precedence.  I think Beowulf  for example  should be more widely read and appreciated then  the Bible or Quran.  ,samharris,de7ld3k,2,t5_2thqg

But now we have to decide which ones are valid and which not?gtI do not see how this would be relevant. If you are a physicalist than intuitions and wellbeing are physical phenomena are they not?Lets put it this way The belief in god is a physical phenomenon derived from an intuition. If intuitions about the truth are prima facie valid science can pack up its bags and go home because it has nothing left to do.Now I know of no way to test the empirical validity of an intuition when the validity of the intuition has been assumed to be valid apriori. Could you explain to me how one does this?gtBut how would you argue this on scientific grounds?Same way anyone argues things on scientific grounds. By creating a thesis that has an empirically testable component.gtThis seems all completely confused to me. Apriori truths are typically considered to be made before any experience. They are thus generated deductively and the problem of induction does not apply.Right. The physical sciences do not trust induction because they are interested in discovering mind invariant truths. The physical sciences do not accept any kinds of arguments made on inductive grounds. Instead the inductive arguments are considered to be consistent with observed results insofar as one can say empirically observable results can be generated and then considered to be not yet proven false.Only the results themselves are taken to be empirically true. Science is interested in the objective empirical truth. Inductive reasoning cannot produce empirical truths.gtI do not see how this follows. The distinction between subjective and objective facts is orthogonal to the problem of induction. No it isnt. Objective truths are mindinvariant that is they exist regardless of whether or not a mind exists. Science regards truths generated through induction to be only subjectively true. It cannot be any other way without completely destroying the notion of what an objective truth is.gtYou seem to be using epistemological and ontological quite differently from their typical use. So I am not sure what you want to tell me here. I have never seen Harris denying that ontologies cannot be known.You dont see the problem with the following paragraphs then?gtI am in essence defending the unity of knowledgethe idea that the boundaries between disciplines are mere conventions and that we inhabit a single epistemic sphere in which to form true beliefs about the world. This remains a controversial thesis and it is generally met with charges of scientism. Sometimes the unity of knowledge is very easy to see Is there really a boundary between the truths of physics and those of biology? No. And yet it is practical even necessary to treat these disciplines separately most of the time. In this sense the boundaries between disciplines are analogous to political borders drawn on maps. Is there really a difference between California and Arizona at their shared border? No but we divide this stretch of desert as a matter of convention. However once we begin talking about noncontiguous disciplinesphysics and sociology saypeople worry that a single consilient idea of truth cant span the distance. Suddenly the different colors on the map look hugely significant. But Im convinced that this is an illusion. .gtAs I argue in my book we may think merely about what isspecifically about the possibilities of experience in this universeand realize that this set of facts captures all that can be valued along with every form of consciousness that could possibly value it. Either a change in the universe can affect the experience of someone somewhere or it cant. I claim that only those changes that can have such effects can be coherently cared about. And if there is a credible exception to this claim I have yet to encounter it. There is only what IS which includes all that is possible. If you cant find your oughts here I cant see any other place to look for them. sourceOntological truths are what is true irrespective of whether or not they affect conscious beings. Sam seems to think science is incoherent insofar as it cares about mindinvariant objective truths divorced of the subjective implication of those truths.That same source also has Sam claiming that epistemology is the only sphere of knowledge of science. How can ontological truths be nested inside epistemological truths according to the discipline of science if the destruction of all minds necessarily renders epistemology unreal? As far as I can see nesting ontological truth inside epistemological truth is a contradiction in terms as far as actual science is concerned.,samharris,de8g7cn,0,t5_2thqg

Anyone part of that group is likely a theocrat and an Islamist. I didnt claim Sam was ever likely to have a really productive conversation with Dalia Mogahed did I? In fact that would have almost certainly been a trainwreck of a podcast. The only potential benefit that could have come from that is the fact Mogahed is an Islamist who managed to bluff her way to notable positions in media and Sam might have pinned her down on her views and exposed her.Theres arguably some value in exposing cryptoIslamists who manage to get a public profile like Mogahed as happened to Tariq Ramadan in the past.

11001021,0,t1_dee71in,I dont object to people laying out whole new ways of looking at things.  But there are systematic ways of doing so.  I watched the first quarter of that video with Peterson and he is constantly jumping around making claims that any educated people would find tenuous and then jumping to another topic. What I have attributed to Peterson is the view that truth including moral truth is decided by reference to what serves Darwinian survival.  Harris raised the tortureworld scenario with him and he did not reply by claiming that he had been misunderstood instead he made some strained arguments to the effect that the torture world could not obtain. You have given an explanation which Peterson did not offer.  I didnt address it because I dont want to add yet another channel to this everexpanding exchange  debating your own idiosyncratic ideas in addition to Peterson.  But let me reply now.  Your explanation proceeds by presenting a dilemma. Accepting ex hypothesi that organisms and their progeny face a future of meaningless suffering these are the choicesa Some organisms could choose to go on existing and ultimately the trait of withstanding torture would be selected for. b No organisms would choose endless torture because life without meaning is not bearable in which case we come to the same conclusion. I take it you think that whether we choose a or b we are led to some conclusion that vindicates the wisdom of Darwinian morality.  You refer to the same conclusion but I dont know what that conclusion is. Lets start with a.  This is not a description of a positive moral outcome.  The fact that withstanding torture might be selected for does not over generations mean that the nonstop torture will be alleviated.  Evolution does not work that way.  So in scenario a all that changes is that nonstop suffering is chosen evolutionarily.  Is your contention that this somehow makes a morally optimal? That makes no sense. Turn to scenario b.  Here I admit I am even more confused. In this world organisms prefer death over endless torture.  When you say in which case we come to the same conclusion do you mean that since this outcome was chosen as in a it must also be morally optimal? What you are doing here is defining moral goodness as whatever organisms choose over the long rung.  This is blatantly circular as an argument for the Darwinian account of morality.   It is also utterly vacuous as a moral theory we are organisms faced theoretically with choosing between a and b and a theory of morality must offer guidance.  Your Darwinian model tells us that whatever we choose that choice will be good by dint of our having chosen it.  This is the Euthyphro dilemma with Darwinian organisms standing in the place of God. ,samharris,deexlx9,1,t5_2thqg

11193193,1,t3_5zs7vg,I think that you need to look beyond yourself and start looking at the majority of people in your life and outside of your social circles.The below is based on my continued reading of Petersons book.When we are faced with a fundamental challenge to our worldview our whole value system breaks down. If it is fundamental enough it can induce a deep depression dark night of the soul where old ways of living are questioned and lined up for destruction. Ive read  about people leaving Christianity going into and out of this state for long periods of time before finally reorienting themselves.Once we have our orientation again we can find our motivation to act. We can once again begin to anticipate things in the future and plan to seek expected rewards avoid potential pain and explore.However if you destroy peoples orienting system e.g. Christianity the atheist movement leaves it to them to figure out how to reorient themselves. Its extremely irresponsible. How do you know what their response will be? How will they adapt and try to understand the world again?One result has been the Social Justice movement so decried in our circles. Many secular people have no fixed moral compass and this movement has provided a quasiMarxist moral system to explain right and wrong and motivate them to act in particular ways. This is really attractive to people who find secularism depressing boring lonely or morally relativistic. They work on advancing feminism attacking perceived sexism and microaggressions. They spread myths about racism such as symbolic and implicit racism and flame people who they decide are racists.Sams brand of atheism has attracted many people into his moral system however Sam does a weak job in ascribing morals to his followers. Be honest he says. Dont believe in bullshit. He doesnt really tell people what they should believe aside from meditation and in objective morality in the abstract. Further he does not at any point tell them what to do. So his followers in many cases just do what he does. They criticize Christianity and Christians. They criticize Islam and Muslims. They engage in flame wars with dishonest people on the internet. What does Peterson say? He says Sort yourself out. He points out the problems but he says that if you want change to happen first you need to fix your own life. Start cleaning your bedroom. Stop misleading people and trying to impress them. He says you should learn from the ancient religious traditions their core moral messages and discard the bullshit.tldr Peterson is not like Deepak Chopra and it is really lazy of you to say so.,samharris,df0qh8e,3,t5_2thqg
11203557,0,t1_df1unzw,You are showing a bunch of epistemological issues with universalizability and general induction. You however have done nothing to show that some other kind of thought fixes or ameliorates those issues you just kind of handwaved towards thinking in different ways while saying seeeee? rationality isnt perfect!Rationality isnt perfect as far as I know because there are fundamental epistemic issues standing in the way a few of which you laid out of anyone ever really knowing anything cogito ergo plum and whatnot. However again you have not shown any other kind of thought that doesnt face these issues. Moreover the times you have seemed to e.g. explaining suprarationality in terms of weight loss advice etc. you were actually contrasting beingbadatrationality with beingmorerational and so again werent doing anything to undermine rationality as a thought mode.Again I maintain that if you ever show me what you call a nonrational thought process and at the same time you are using evidence and reasons to guide your actions in order to achieve some end and this leads you to better achieving those ends I will have to call that being rational again despite your bucketing it otherwise.gtAnd a point along that journey is an attempt to explain that while the rationaldualistic is a useful mode of thought it is not true. It is a convenient fiction that allows us to build bridges and interdimensional spaceships. But its not what is.Youre just conflating what we have conceptualized about the world with rationality and what is with nonrationality. I recognize that there is a difference between our perception and whatis and so did Kant and theres a reason he says he defined such a chasm most pointedly through pure reason. It is totally rational to recognize this chasm. It is not being nonrational at least not by definition as you seem to imply. Whereas you are using this blow to undermine rationality itself i.e. lets use some other thinking besides rationality! Kant used it to say that the worldasitis is shown to be unknowable. I prefer the Kantian conclusion. It makes more sense at least as long as you have not shown something otherthanreason getting you closer to the truth.Like you can say all day that there is deeper truth and that is fine but if the only bridge to try to get there is reason or other bridges that are worse then your argument is just showing how annoying trying to know things is not showing us alternative ways of thinking which seems to at least be Jordans project.,samharris,df1wq4o,1,t5_2thqg
11203789,0,t1_df1eows,Thanks! Im not a follower by nature I think Peterson has a lot of good ideas but just cuz he says something doesnt make it a good idea. I tend to think Peterson was just playing along to move the conversation forward you can hear his doubts but he might have just been having dumb thoughts.Sams toy examples dont make good thought experiments to my thinking because they dont describe things that happen in IRL except in cases that dont matter. To Sams idea that death is preferable to suffering nope We saw at the top of the World Trade Towers on  people who were suffering torture from heat anxiety etc. Many of those people jumped we all agree with Sam in not questioning their decision even devout Roman Catholics I am an atheist pray and hope that God take mercy on their souls for the suicide decision they made. OK Sam? We agree... but only with their individual decisions there is no ought here. Lets underline this this is an isought failure read on for proof. But Petersons Darwinian Truth works better. Other people in the two towers didnt jump either or all because their brain chemistry keeps them at a lower level of anxiety they were more heat tolerant they were a few feet away where the heat was less etc. And had the towers not collapsed eventually they would have been rescued. If this actual experiment took place every day in our evolutionary history our ancestors would have processed it both genetically and psychoemotionally and we would have religions warped to include it oh look Hawaiians worship volcanoes and we would have a stronger fear of heights and fires andor more of our offspring would survive jumps from the second floor if they had wisps of sugar glider flying squirrels adaptations etc. Even the Roman Catholic no suicide not ever religious adaptation can be seen to make species sense. If you are not the one suffering you have a clear head and can rally your troops just endure it a little more God would not be testing you this way without a reason because more of your turns out to be Darwinian followers will survive that way.  And this is all in accordance with Dawkins ideas in Teh Selfish GeneI dont see any of Sams morality in these situation I see cold hard factoids competing for survival. Go back and listen to the podcast just before your link what matters is who survives not who is tortured less. Survival is the only value not because its a value but because it is all that ... survives. The nice thing about survival of the fittest the fittest will survive being a tautology is that it doesnt require proof In any case Sams idea about suffering he acknowledes is built on top of consciousness. Consciousness is built on top of quantum mechanics... ultimately. But mediating between the two is another layer Dawinian processes. Sams Truths are built on top of Petersons Truths are built on top of Quantum Mechanics. Im not saying inside of or outside of or higher lower better but simply Darwinian processes fall in between the Objective Reality of quarks and atoms and the Consciousness inside our brains.,samharris,df1xo8s,-1,t5_2thqg

Theories are not so much wrong as incomplete.gtThis can be pointed out in many cases other than just the shape of the earth.

11274274,0,t1_df80etn,Well nobody really have any solid bedrock principles. At the bottom of any philosophy except maybe nihilism there are axioms that you more or less take on based on your preference.Sams preference that pointless suffering is bad is based on a feeling that we evolved with. Pain is a mechanism that our body uses to tell us when our body is compromised and empathy is a circuit we developed to know when other peoples bodies are compromised. Petersons preference goes a bit further this is my interpretation at least that if we are to go by feeling anyway the feeling that suffering is bad for example. Then why not say that what matters is when you do the things that feels meaningful. And you do the things that feel meaningful when you stand with one foot in chaos and one in order and try to create order out of chaos.I think thats the gist of it anyway,samharris,df9x7yt,2,t5_2thqg

11323633,0,t3_61lqbb,Its just a very very long road.  You arent talking about a single podcast to effect change in one person.  You are talking about years of podcasts with just that one person.  If you watch Daryl Davis in Accidental Courtesy you can sort of see the process and its very very long slow painful and by the time youre done Sam having spent that much time befriending the wrong people will be painted by the left as a rightwing bigot oh wait too late.  BLM did that with Mr Davis for his friendships with Ku Klux Klan members.  It was sad to see.  Its always tempting to think oh well just lead them by the nose down the road of reason  all the irrational dirt roads that go off from it are easy to spot and avoid and it never works out that way.  We are all irrational creatures.  Every one of us.  We dont have our current set of beliefs fro purely rational reasons.  Maybe there are some rational reasons thrown in sometimes  Ill happily be agnostic on that possibility.  But mostly no.  You believe what you believe  because of circumstance not the awesome power of your brain.  I believe what I believe mostly because of circumstance.  We all do.  So if youre going to change someones mind you have to accept that and realize that presenting a powerful rational argument can easily backfireThe ways past the backfire effect require recognition of emotional realities.  This is why the current divisiveness and all the justification of rudeness and insulting and painting the other side with broad brushes is problematic.  Because of the way we are communicating the problems are getting worse rather than better.  Your specific approach here would almost certainly lead to mr Kindler to become more entrenched in his views and a big part of why is because you are trying to paint him into a corner by only allowing certain concerns into the discussion.  Its like when Sam and Batman sparred.  Batman had concerns he needed addressed.  Sam didnt.  Sam doesnt.  Sam only insists that we talk about certain facts and agree on them before moving on.  Batman needed assurances before going down that road and Sam lacked the empathy to give them.  The left in general needs assurances that the antiimmigration right isnt going to end up in some obvious bad places.  The right in general refuses to give assurances and wants to hyperfocus on a small set of little facts.  Without empathy that debate will go nowhere.,samharris,dffijz1,10,t5_2thqg
11329322,0,t1_dfg474z,gt Its extremely worrisome given that if you truly believe that it is genetics then there isnt that many logic peaceful solutions. You are already talked about parts of society being better than others by their genetics. If anything that has a dangerous logic to it. If I believed like you did I would assume nazi propaganda to be extremely alluring.I dont debate with people who would ignore truth when it is uncomfortable. Average IQ is different across races and we know that to be true. The difference is either nature genetics or nurture environment. I of course believe it is a mixture of the two as does every scientist in the world but I think the genetic factor is much more important than the environmental factor and twin studies seem to back me up on that point.However with all of that being said you must be able to differentiate between someone or some group having higher intelligence and them being better. I do not think that high intelligence is necessary for a peaceful society or fulfilling life. I am above average intelligence but not a genius and I dont feel any envy for those more intelligent than me.

11352300,0,t1_dfiph9e,Yeah.  I think were both understanding each other and our differences were mostly just surface semantics.  Just going to add little disagreements where I see them because were getting to interesting places.gtAcknowledging that true free will doesnt exist can make us more moral. It removes any reason to hate someone. They cant help how they are. Their brain is the way it is due to physical changes that person had no control over.Agreed and I think thats essentially Sams purpose behind his book on freewill.  But to be a good consequentionalist you have to place blame in order to change future behaviors for the better.  Shame is an emotion which can be easily overdone to our detriment... but I think it has its place sometimes.  Children for example arent rational beings or moral.  And neither are adults though most have learned to move in that direction.This might be beside the point... but...When a person says I could have done otherwise... they dont mean I believe I live in a nondeterministic universe and I could have if we replayed the scenario exactly through the power of freewill changed course.  They mean I could have done otherwise or can do otherwise in sufficiently similar scenarios.  So blame is useful if it helps prevent bad decisions in sufficiently similar scenarios in the future.   But again blame and shame have their limits in a consequentialist framework as Sam shows.  I agree with that.gtDennet nor Sam say Consciousness is an illusion. On the contrary Sam says Consciousness is the only thing that cant be an illusion. At least to the individual experience to their own consciousness. Something is going on even if youre in the Matrix a head in a vat or a computer simulation. Dennett does...a sort of illusion... but the meaning of consciousness he and Sam are using is different.  Sam is using the seems to be a different thing version of illusion but hes talking about the phenomenological experience itself.  And Dennett agrees with that... it is all seeming after all.  But Dennett means consciousness as understood by most people as something beyond the physical the basis for the Philosophical Zombie argument... as something that has a Hard Problem... its the explanatory requirements of the phenomenon which are illusory.  Now Dennetts talking about consciousness from an objective rd person perspective... as a natural phenomenon.  Hes essentially saying The Hard Problem doesnt exist and people call consciousness whatever defies physical explanation something calling for an answer to the Hard Problem. Its magic for adults.Maybe you could untangle this better than me.,samharris,dfirg6g,1,t5_2thqg

I have not said anything close to you need to explain the mechanism behind a phenomenon before you establish the existence of said phenomenon in the first place. What Ive done is to say that if your very basic intiution about evolution thats what your a priori assumption is you have to realize this is to be true then a few things have to be true as well. Thats the three steps Ive mentioned over and over again. One of the steps you didnt even understand and youve not provided any reasoning for why the other two should be assumed to be true. If we cant assume the steps to be true then we cant assume your assumption to be true. Youre talking about inductive reasoning? Well this is basic logic. If this was about skin pigmentation then I could answer those three steps easily.. Ive provided you with evidence that shows that so when you see that there is a difference with respect to virtually anything else of course youd assume that there would in some degree be a difference in intelligence is straight up false some things are selected for other things arent. Again you have offered absolutely nothing to show that intelligence is one of the things thats selected for instead of one of the things that arent.. And then after youve measured and established the fact which people have done False with respect to intelligence and genetics which is what were talking about..

11581828,0,t1_dg8boqb,I dont claim hes dishonest because we disagree. I claim hes dishonest because he is dishonest. Take the following example On page  of GCBC Taubes lies about the results of the Womens Heath Initiative claiming thatgt The women on the diet also consumed fewer caloriesaveraging  calories a day less than the controls over the eight years of the study.gt gt They did not however lose any weight because of this which is paradoxical and an issue we will discuss later.The reality is they lost a significant amount of weight. When I wrote Taubes to point out his mistake he claimed this was journalistic license.Or this example On page  of GCBC Taubes lies about the results of a Cochrane review on cholesterol stating that the review claimed that lowering cholesterol had no significant effect on cardiovascular events. But the reality is cholesterol reduction actually significantly reduced cardiovascular events. The same authors published the Cochrane results in BMJ and they concluded thengt The findings on cardiovascular events are broadly in keeping with benefits that might be expected from modest lowering of cholesterol concentration and certainly provide support at an individual level for the central role of dietary fat intake in the causation of cardiovascular disease.Or consider the following testimony from Robert Levy director of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute gt We have no doubt from the vast amount of epidemiological data available that elevated cholesterol is associated with an increased risk of heart attack especially some specific types of high cholesterol. We have no doubt that blood cholesterol can be lowered by diet andor medication in most patients. Where the doubt exists is the question of whether lowering blood cholesterol will result in a reduced incidence of heart attack that is still presumptive. It is unproven but there is a tremendous amount of circumstantial evidence. Not only is there circumstantial epidemiologic data but there is very exciting animal data. Here is one of many studies that have been done over the last decade with nonhuman primates. It shows that not only can we prevent atherosclerosis from progressing by making dietary changes but that regression actually occurs. Atherosclerosis will lessen if we lower blood cholesterol levels in animals through diet. The problem is we cant do these kinds of studies in man it is not ethical. There is no doubt that blood cholesterol can be lowered by diet in freeliving populations. It can be lowered by  to  percent.But heres how Taubes represents Levys words on page gt Having held one set of hearings before publishing the Dietary Goals McGovern responded to the ensuing uproar with eight followup hearings. Among those testifying was Robert Levy director of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute who said that no one knew whether lowering cholesterol would prevent heart attacks which was why the NHLBI was spending several hundred million dollars to study the question.gt If you disagree with him fine talk about the science and be productive. But stop trashing his character and give some credit where its due.Im not calling Taubes a child molester Im saying hes dishonest because he is. And if youd bothered to click the link OP provided you would know that I DO engage with the science. Heres the science on Chapter One of GCBC Scroll to the bottom and theres a link to Chapter Two At the bottom a link to Chapter Three and so on.

Even if shes real and sincere shes literally a random philosophy student MA not even PhD that has written one thing on the internet. Why would I take her public policy suggestions seriously? She could be a crazy person for all we know.In contrast The Guardian piece is a personal account so the scrutiny comes down to how plausible is what the author is purporting happened? In my own person experience very. I dont know whats wrong with YouTubes algorithm but even though I subscribe to a bunch of liberal YouTube channels and watch lots of liberal videos as soon as I watch even a portion of a rightwing themed video my suggested videos gets filled with rightwing videos.

What leg do you have to stand on if altright activists start acting in kind and causing a riot every time someone they dont like comes to speak on campus?I thought I was clear in my comment but let me be more explicit I do not believe this decision was about the threat of violence. I think its about stopping rightwing charlatans from using the school as a venue for their subsequent fundraising.But lets assume it is because of the threat of violence. I dont think you can extrapolate isolated instances regarding specific people to a larger trend. That is I dont think every rightofcenter speaker is going to be prevented from speaking on campus due to the threat of violence. And lets be clear here Ann Coulter is a piece of shit bomb thrower. Its not like they wanted a Republican state senator to speak on campus and their was a threat of violence. Ann Coulter is garbage.  I dont believe for a moment that republican student groups motives are pure.Finally I dont necessarily think its terrible to just outright ban student groups from having public figures from speaking on campus. In fact I think the bar should be set way way higher than where it is. Ann Coulter has access to media you dont need to see her talk at your school to hear her bullshit. Is that harming the students? I dont think so. But if a prospectivestudent does then they can choose not to go to that school or if they do go they can demand the speaker have a right to speak and if theyre in the majority I think their voice should be heard. Whatever.I see this whole thing as bullshit that rightwingers like to cry about because they want to distract attention from the fact that their politicians and these asshats being invited to colleges want to cut social services and outlaw abortion and all kinds of other awful things.,samharris,dgi1pcd,1,t5_2thqg

A student in that circumstance would probably need to work a lot harder to get the same grades as someone who grows up in an affluent neighborhood to highly educated parents.But the problem is that we currently have a system that uses ethnicity as the biggest indicator for circumstance when instead we should look at the circumstances themselves. Maybe ethnicity is a good indicator most of the time but not all the time.

11748157,0,t1_dgrk3yo,Harris isnt a learned philosopher. Lately hes shown a lack of professionalism by failing to conduct even a single evening of research into trying to figure out a balanced way of viewing Murrays work. We can all see the results. However I dont believe for a moment that Harris is a charlatan or a huckster. These words imply that he is deliberately misleading people. Whatever you might say about him  that hes wrong on a lot of issues which he might be or that he often doesnt engage the experts in the fields he talks about which is only sometimes true see the profiling discussion  he seems quite obviously genuine. In the case of this most recent podcast I think hes just seriously ignorant.,samharris,dgrolgh,1,t5_2thqg

11762875,0,t1_dgtbviy,Maybe its not hard for you. It may still be hard for me. Which is exactly my point. That guy Sam had on his podcast who gave everything he earned over  to charity might say that its not that hard to do that. Others may find it extremely hard. I cant think of a single vegan meal I think I would enjoy. Unless eating fruit until Im full counts as a meal. ,samharris,dgtcng4,6,t5_2thqg

This culture embraces laziness drunkeness sexual promiscuity lack of ambition fighting etc. This culture spread to others in the South,samharris,dgtxw5k,3,t5_2thqg

11798371,0,t1_dgxcfpq,Ive been thinking about this and it has occurred to me that it is actually seems possibly more reasonable since the advent of racially based mandated diversity quotasaffirmative action which I guess is the point Murray was trying to make albeit in a rather non incisive manner. People are using the race is a social construct or race is arbitrary argument against these studies but it isnt really relevant as long as it is using the same definitions that the social systems it might inform use. If there is a team somewhere carefully calculating what the metrics for success of some affirmative action program are and the assumption that everyone has the same max cap on their capabilities in every respect is implicit in their calculations then we have to know if those assumptions are correct or we might never be able to never declare success. In other words if we want to smash the racism inherent in the system we need to factor out any racism that might be inherent in nature or we will be constantly frustrated. This seems like it could be a recipe for further resentment and anger as that frustration mounts. Even if you think as I do that it doesnt matter if the results of affirmative action benefit those they are designed to help beyond what they might otherwise achieve given a perfect level playing field when those systems are then phased out the extra benefit would evaporate and be considered a regression to non equality. Honestly I dont know how much I believe any of that and I certainly dont have a position on race and IQ although I would be less prone now than I was a month ago to consider anyone who thought it was worth studying a racist.,samharris,dgxdwjk,3,t5_2thqg
11802682,0,t1_dgvhq2n,No I have to disagree with you you should not have to defend every action that you take maybe there is good reasons to abandon those old ways but its not your responsibility to take a stance on every issue in the world you get to pick and choose which battles you want to fight.The slave analogy falls way off we have no idea if slavery have been similar in the US it was something along the lines of  who owned slaves I suspect that you will find similar numbers throughout history its a social construct only possible due to the forming of civilizations and as such I can agree that every civilizationnationcollection of such should have a stance on itand we do.,samharris,dgxvidn,1,t5_2thqg
