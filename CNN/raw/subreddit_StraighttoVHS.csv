I think your example is awesome and Im gonna try to nail this down.Awesome! I think it would just make it a great resource for new players or anyone who just wants to jump in and play. ,StraighttoVHS,d1quaqb,1,t5_34bz3

9862962,0,t3_5gkf5b,Hmmmm... The Werewolf trope with a couple tweaks is pretty close. Check it!Werewolf Super Saiyan When you are reduced to  HP or when an ally is reduced to  HP you turn into a Super Saiyan. While you are a Super Saiyan you can fly and you get an epic die to all DEF and STR rolls!Turning into a Super Saiyan heals  HP. As a Super Saiyan you cant use weapons except your own fists and feet which give  to attacks. You turn back to normal at the end of the scene. Your hunter instincts powerlevelindicator allow you to always know when an enemy is reduced to half their HP or less the Director must tell you when asked. Also you freakin glow so dont expect to blend into a crowd. to any two stats   to any stat  Forte Intimidation You get these Cinematic ActionsAwoo! Ehuhh! Once per scene As a Super Saiyan you can earn an epic dice token by spending  AP to grunt or gasp.Bloodfrenzy Ultimate Move Once per scene when an enemy has half their HP or less you gain two epic dice to a single attack or another highly physical action.This is rough and quickly done but here are the basic balancing maneuvers Super Saiyan is weaker than Werewolf because it requires a dire moment to trigger the transformation and because the transformation ends when the scene ends. Also I took out the transformation raising max HP by . Also the transformation doesnt give epic dice to ATH rolls.Super Saiyan is stronger than werewolf because you can freaking fly circumventing a lot of potential ATH rolls anyway. Also the transformation doesnt give penalties to CHA and INT and now gives epic dice to DEF rolls which is HUGE!Its certainly more Super Saiyanesque and it might be something in the same ballpark as balanced.One last thing Id be tempted to do would be to completely redo Ultimate Move as a kamehameha sort of thing. Something really powerful but make it take a turn to charge up... That said I dont think charging moves is particularly fun in games so an alternative might be turning in an epic dice token to represent the effort put in.Ultimate Move Once per scene turn in an epic dice token and spend  AP to unleash a spirit bomb that can attack from Very Far. This attack gets an attack bonus of   your number of montages.EDIT One thing thats messed up though is that this reflavored trope doesnt give a Blooper or another method of Showing Weakness. Super Saiyans basically dont have any weaknesses though... or so I initially thought. Behold!Filler Shot Once per scene during an action sequence do absolutely nothing on your turn but stare and grunt in order to show weakness.,StraighttoVHS,dat60e7,3,t5_34bz3
