7737050,0,t3_4jugpd,Excellent post surprised its gone  days without feedback.    I agree in the situation as presented I would expect far more disorder and rage from those apparently sentenced to death. What weve seen is largely an anarchic situation with looting the rednecks gangs the shop and outofcontrol addicts the Data Recovery garage and the baseball field  little to no pushback from infected persons knowing theyre dying and that help isnt coming. Even were it not to present in a vengeful manner as you mentioned with the bag there would be people jumping to their death or committing suicidebypolice at the cordon to avoid the pain and be seen and heard. Within the cordon a handful of police wouldnt last a day at this point in the narrative they would be strung from the nearest lampposts as representatives of the system that created or allowed the situation.    I think that things will escalate once we get to that first scene from the pilot episode. It was shown as day  and were at the ninth day as of the end of Ep . Id certainly like to see more chaos and people acting in believable albeit disturbing ways.  Just putting this out there but I think by the end of the series it will be a race between having a cure and the complete annihilation of the cordon zone by the govt.    Edit  Read elsewhere that the response seen in the pilot was day . Just checked and thats accurate. Guess we wont see that brought to fruition next week.,CONTAINMENT,d3lna7k,1,t5_31t2e

I thought they might kill her off before I started watching but then I thought they wouldnt bedause she was doing so well. This will break Jake. Im hoping its some mutation or something different Julie Plec said the virus would change.  ,CONTAINMENT,d4qzm6u,2,t5_31t2e
