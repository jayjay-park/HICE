3037634,0,t3_2tdpfr,Hey everyone! My name is Sapphire and I like to think of myself as a writer but I love all forms of art and try to participate in as much as I can. I consider myself an aesthete  someone who loves beauty for the sake of beauty. To learn more about that you can look up aestheticism or read some Joyce or Wilde. I could talk about books and films all day! My favourite eras run from the s to the s. I also love music and my interests span genres from stuff youd respect to stuff youd make fun of me for    Matt Lieberman is my favourite SourceFeder because I really identify with him and I love how he is really honest and open about his emotions.     I guess send me a message on here if you want to chat Ill try to check it often!,Lieberfriends,coculuw,1,t5_361ke

Everything is regulated by user votes upvotes good downvotes bad and various communities are separated into subreddits. If you can think of it then theres probably a subreddit for it and if there isnt then you can always make one. Dont go to spacedicks and everything should be fine any questions?,Lieberfriends,cpn22dz,1,t5_361ke
