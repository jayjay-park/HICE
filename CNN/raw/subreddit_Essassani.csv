4286661,0,t3_39sccx,This has not anything to do with Bashar but what helped me by far the most with my depression are the videos youtube and books of Jeff Foster Falling in love with where you are and The deepest Acceptance are amazing.Basically its all about facing the life energy directly as it is manifesting now and knowing yourself as that life energy. If its manifesting as fear joy bliss depression emptiness confusion.... its all okay its all an intelligent expression of life and not a threat to life.I can only say from my experience Everytime the depression and emptiness is accepted fully and when i am going into it completely it has a real potential to burn old unuseful concepts personality aspects beliefs emotions... just old stuff. I go deeper and deeper into my being.Its all a process. Sometimes the emptiness comes sometimes the fullness is here sometimes both at the same time.. they are the same.. everything is allowed here.,Essassani,cs8tt12,1,t5_317fg

5169509,0,t1_cv8wks9,Haha. Its always exciting to feel new channeled entities. If only I was able to channel like Darryl does Id do it all the time! Well almost all the time anyway. Ive spent soo much money on Bashar channelings that its almost crazy. In fact its fullblown crazy! But what can you do it has helped my life more than the money I spent on it. Would love to do my own channeling though as well.Edit. I feel like Darryl for whatever reason to me seems to be the most talented channel the most accurate and helpful one. I wonder if it takes a lot of practice to become so proficient at channeling or was it like this even in the beginning.,Essassani,cv946w9,5,t5_317fg
