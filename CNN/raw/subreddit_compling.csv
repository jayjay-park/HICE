11532012,0,t1_dg34ibi,gt Stats version Would use information about previous words tag and probability of POS tag given that information to determine current words POS tag.And how would it get this previous information about a words POS tag? How would it GET a probability for it without some previously gotten data from either rules or from human annotation? Surely it would have to get it from a rulebased model first prior to even being ABLE to be put into a statistical model. Right? So how is statistical any good when it relies so much on having the right previous information which seems to only be attainable by  putting it through a rulebased model beforehand or  manual human annotation. If thats what it takes to make a statistical model then why not just use rulebased models for everything since you obviously need them first to even get that previous information that a stat model needs otherwise resort to manual human annotation which would also defeat the purpose of a statistical approach?,compling,dg35m35,1,t5_2qs1s
