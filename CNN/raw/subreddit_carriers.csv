4453844,0,t3_3awpu8,TMobile for me.  First reason is price I got in on the Unlimited Everything promo or  if you referred someone plus  to match data up to GB on a tablet. Cant really beat that.Second Im just not happy with the other carriers.  ATampampampampT and Verizon are of course expensive. But I dont like their political stances on net neutrality and I dont like what theyre doing by gutting their wirelines networks solely because the ROI on selling everyone expensive capped wireless data and even suggesting its fine for primaryhome use is higher than continuing to sell dependable lessexpensive wireline data services.  Investments in fiberbased broadband which is what communities need is now nil. And not far from where I live Verizon chose to let its copper network rot in the ground than repair or upgrade it to fiber.For me paying them for wireless service is equivalent to rewarding bad behavior and sanctioning a business model that will bite us all in the he ass later after current leadership takes their golden parachutes and bail.Sprint... yeah no.  I was actually with them from  to  and saw it go downhill and never really recover.  Not going back.Not to say TMobile is perfect.  Ive been pretty vocal in their subreddit about their recent policy change and how unlimited isnt really unlimited anymore.  And coverage could of course be better but by and large its been good enough for where I go.In the end TMobile is the least of all practical evils for me.,carriers,css39w5,1,t5_2yu5j

6924461,0,t3_4aidde,I dont really see the upside to this for consumers.  Instead of having LTEU coverage it would be much better to have have wifi coverage.  Obviously someone has to pay for the infrastructure but in the places where LTEU would be useful that shouldnt be a problem.  All LTEU does is give the carriers more places where you can pay for using data.,carriers,d117n9s,2,t5_2yu5j
7380966,0,t1_d2h4km8,Lets put it this way  is your only option for unlimited anything on mobile and congestion is a very real problem on their network even after they upped prices on unlimited. If you want internet in all parts of London theyre not your best bet.Wired internet is pretty cheap too my friend and his flatmates pay  for M cable uncapped on Virgin I think.,carriers,d2h5yrc,1,t5_2yu5j
