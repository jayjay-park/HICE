88154,0,t3_1v3v4f,Hooters is a restaurantbar that has attractive women as servers thats all you need to know about it. The food is good but not great everything is a little more expensive than what it ought to be. Obviously the main attraction there is the girls. Its a decent place to go with guys at least once but dont expect anything more than that.  Stay away from the strip clubs in the center if thats what you guys are interested in they prey on tourists and will rip you off of hundreds of euros without you even buying anything. They typically have a bouncer out on the street trying to talk you into going in.,budapest,ceogrci,3,t5_2rxz1

1374684,0,t3_29n96h,The train station for the airport is located more then kms miles from the airport terminal building! The route leads through a very busy road and a motorway. I would not recommend this.Instead you could take the train to Vecss which is a small town next to the airport. From there airport is closer and you can use small not busy streets to reach the Shell petrol station. There you can cross the motorway using a pedestrian crossing and then use the old service road of the airport to reach the terminal building. Its a bit more complicated but much less dangerous. Here is a map I made.Edit Yay my first gold! Thank you kind stranger!,budapest,ciolqtp,4,t5_2rxz1

1678058,0,t3_2djxaz,I was there for five days I totally fell in love with it so I did feel that I could have stayed even longer than that. It is a really big city with a lot of things to do and see so as much time as your willing to give it is ideal theres no danger of running out of things to explore. I guess you could do it in three days a day in Pest and two in Buda with a few hours in a bath and maybe a trip to Margaret Island.Have fun its a wonderful place. ,budapest,cjqok4a,2,t5_2rxz1

4261936,0,t1_cs5yah3,Oh yes. Well we basically went to Morrisons  twice  one Tuesdays it has an offer entry fee   beers for florint by pm ft is something like . euros.There also was an open bar there on Thursday and we noticed the place was huge  there were like  different dancefloors interconnected and each with their own music s rap rampbdance. It was amazing.We also visited Instant. It too had different levels and is based in an old building. Tip Beware of pickpockets while there although we did not get robbed there were a couple of suspicious faces. The music was good and there was a good crowd even though it was a weekday. Partying continued till late in the morning.,budapest,cs61eo3,2,t5_2rxz1
4333523,0,t1_csdvbkg,Thanks for such a detailed answer! I saw you mention the City Change guys in another thread just after posting actually I think thats what Ill do  just bring spending money in UK  and visit them to top up Forints whenever I need. I think my hostel is closest to Oktogon just one block along.No worries about the polyfoam  I was thinking too that somebody must have left one at the hostel by now! And if not theyre not expensive  I just dont like wasting things. But I guess I could leave it at the hostel for somebody else!Thanks for clarifying about the ticket booking  schedule websites. Ill try to buy in advance for peace of mind  but if its too bad then Ill just wait until I arrive.Yeah its a shame Ill only get one night at VOLT! Unfortunately I need to fly on Saturday so if I was still at Sopron on Saturday morning I think it would be a bit hectic. Not very many train connections at the right times. Ill probably have a nicer time making the most of one night then have a relaxed Friday just getting back to Budapest  Thursday looks good at VOLT though anyway from the artists I do know! Any Hungarian or other artists that I wont have heard of that you recommend? Anybody else reading this can suggest as well!Thanks for the links to clubs  Ill check online whats happening at each one closer to the night. Any recommendations for favourite ruin pubs would be welcome from people too Now all I need to do is hit YouTube and learn some bad Hungarian!,budapest,cse48i9,1,t5_2rxz1
4649209,0,t1_ctfk71q,gt here will be big fireworks in the evening launching from the Danube and the hills best viewing points are near the central parts of the Danube bank on the Pest side but you need to arrive many hours early for a good spot and earIll be in budapest on that day itll be my last day there can you give me some more advice about time and location? Is there enough space there to relax and have a picnic?There is something similar in my hometown and I have to get to the park like  hours earlier or is impossible to get in ,budapest,ctglg1m,1,t5_2rxz1
5023384,0,t1_curfifp,I live in Somogyi Bela utca .   Dont really have an idea about the budget just the cheapest one which is ok quality. In Belgium I pay around  euros a month so maybe something around that price category.

6297076,0,t3_41u5lz, euros is more than enough. As an example Im paying  euros a month for a decent place in the V district very central so more expensive. Its two bedrooms and has some bills included and I only recently moved in after a year of where the prices had been rising quite steadily thanks to people buying up property for Airbnb so Im told.I expect I dont spend much more than  euros a month and thats going out regularly meeting new people etc etc so youll be able to live more than easily on that wage. ,budapest,cz5emu5,1,t5_2rxz1
6495701,0,t3_44l7p6,Champs and John Bull are the two main sports bars of the city but Im not sure if theyll keep open until am for the fans. And if they do they might be booked full already so call ahead to inquire. Otherwise watch it from your accommodation it will be shown on Sport with Hungarian commentary. ,budapest,czr7c2l,2,t5_2rxz1

6953016,0,t3_4axzn3,The classic one at Morrisons I think all of them have it pm cocktails  or  for  beer and tequila both . They also have an unlimited drinks offer on Wednesday and Thursday which means  alcoholic and unlimited nonalcoholic drinks. Price depends on your time of arrival to the place between  and . I havent been in quite a while but I remember they water down everything pretty heavily especially the house beer but its still a decent deal. Its also a pretty young crowd there high schoolers and early s mostly. Afternoon happy hours are held at Pointer Pubs quality draft beer Krusovice Bombarier l or l for the house draft. ,budapest,d14gg4r,2,t5_2rxz1

8144301,0,t3_4qsiex,Summer is mostly festival time so Budapest quiets down a bit but Corvin Klub formerly Corvintet A Hellobabybar Doboz tkert and Instant should provide plenty of options to choose from for you. Or any of the other many dozens of clubs in the party district alongside Kirly Kazinczy Nagymez etc. streets in the party district. For Saturday you could attend the Sparty at Szchenyi Baths. I hear its kind of touristy and mostly a sausage fest but its without doubt something you are unlikely to find elsewhere in the world. ,budapest,d4vl0ma,2,t5_2rxz1

Even those have mailboxes grouped together at the nearest junction or whatever landmark is nearby. Your package wont get a new tracking number just because it arrived to the country. The original one is still valid and you can check it here But dont expect wonders its possible there wont be any updates.Yes normally after failed delivery attempts the packages are held at the nearest post office for a period of time and after that they send it back to the sender or whatever else they specified happens. ,budapest,d8rzol1,2,t5_2rxz1
