6801435,0,t3_48tx3r,As others have very nicely answered your questions Ill just give my opinion  My favourite dungeon is the final one of the main story. The atmosphere is perfect theres enough of a challenge and the Georama aspect is beautiful. It adds a level of depth and contrast you dont see in many RPGs. Youve got a brilliant game ahead of you so keep up the good work!,DarkCloud,d0n8hp0,2,t5_2tzb4

8100178,0,t3_4q3rzw,As much as I hate LEGEND and the Island King for their short slow combos they absolutely trump everything with their sheer power. Fav weapon is Chronicle II but it pales in comparison with the Island king. The weapons are sadly a numbers game which is why I prefer the  star amulet over love and supernova over other guns which is good because I like beam weapons,DarkCloud,d4qj733,3,t5_2tzb4
