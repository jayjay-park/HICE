3609378,0,t3_31olho,This is more difficult for us than the other clans. We are truly dancing on the precipice of destruction.The first trial is the quiet waiting haunted by the distant sounds of drums and the beating of our own hearts. It may be days or even months by some estimates. For this trial I advise we discern a threat awareness system that administers different levels of communication organization and action. We are just now coming together but soon we will have to train and fight as one body.The second trial is mist of purple blood when hundreds if not thousands attempt to earn our badge of honor and are cast into the pit of a million tangled corpses. We must devise a means of interpreting when those who are unaligned have been used up and the timer reaches consistently into the dying sun. We will have to work with the Knights of the Button to time this well.The final trial is of trust and timing. It is grueling and if the Gods are with us then it will be a time where rivers run red with our blood. We will have to devise a system whereby we maximize the effectiveness of our warriors but must also have backup clickers and organized teams dedicated to reporting their availability and accomplishment of the mission. Well need some serious preparation and a chat room.We will also have to be wary of assassins who will no doubt strike at this critical hour. Also we will need to account for incoming Pressiah Pretenders who may stir infighting and factionalization even within our ranks. I suspect the Knights of the Button will lose muster in the end days and we will absorb those who remain but those ranks will be infested with assassins.All these and more challenges still are why our clan is destined for greatness. Regardless of what lies beyond the death of the button and regardless of the righteousness of the various philosophies that have emerged we have chosen the greatest challenge. The other clans are weak they make excuses they justify themselves with false praise for petty flairs but even the colors who reign this day will be corpses in the books of history. It is we few who will die in the final days under the greatest tribulations with more enemies than any in our land have ever faced who deserve to be remembered for eternity.,TheRedguard,cq3p1ni,23,t5_37nos

4000056,0,t1_crc86m3,A great place to begin is the Redguard wiki There you will find information that is frankly  quite outdated. But it is a start. Some Redguard desire to extend the life of the button as much as possible like the Knights of the button some simply want a red flair. What we all have in common is that desire for red. The truth is in this new era of red we need to redefine what it means to be a Redguard. Before it was simple support your fellow brethren in their goal of reaching red but now the game has changed. What does it mean to be a Redguard now that anybody can claim red with relative ease? We must decide that together. Right now what is important is that we remain united as a strong community. That means actively participating in threads on here debating on matters of the button how we relate to other colors etc. The best thing you can do is continue to provide meaningful discussion with your fellow Redguard. Do not go gently into the winter night. ,TheRedguard,crc8ksn,1,t5_37nos
