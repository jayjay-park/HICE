363,0,t1_cee862a,Its a throwback to Batmans older days. Worlds Greatest Detective and a master of disguise kind of thing. Batman historically was a much different character using guns all the time at one point for example in the classic era. But some things have stuck like being an ninjainfiltratoractor. Ever see Kill Bill? When Bill gives the speech about Batman SpiderMan and Superman hes almost wrong. He says Supermans alterego is Clark Kent. Batman is who Bruce Wayne chose to be. He only adopts Bruce Wayne as a disguise to hide his real identity who he would be all the time if he could which is Batman. It sort of ties into that ability to become someone else to accomplish what he needs to.,arrow,ceehaj3,1,t5_2u4js

58244,0,t3_1uqm9n,Look to be honest everyone needs to end the debate right now Laurel is going to BE THE BLACK CANARY at some point in this show! Thats the way they have already had it planned and its the way they want it to go. Every character in this show goes through an origin that are defying expectations meeting expectations and exceeding expectationsAndrew Kreisberg Executive Producer of the story behind these iconic comic book characters. For example as a fan of the Green Arrow comics knowing that Ollie hating having to kill people and only did it out of necessity I was a little shocked seeing Oliver kill as many henchman as he did. I was never angry one because it looked awesome and two I knew this was the origin of the Green Arrow I know and love from the comics. I knew he would have different aspects of the characters origin but I knew that by the end it was going to be the Hero I always read. The Flash origin in which spoiler s He gets struck by the lightning while doused in the chemicals saying that they teased it in the episode prior and they were constantly talking about the particle accelerator through the first part of the second season. They change my expectation of how Barry would become the Flash but then ended up doing it better than I thought it could have ever been done on TV. With the Black Canary I see them doing the same thing. I believe they are going to give us a great Black Canary in Sara which I believe they are and at some point that mantle will be handed to Laurel and the way it is going to be done is going to exceed my expectation. I trust the writers of this show not just because they have done an excellent job so far but from the comics I have read by them and knowing that they are extremely talented and intelligent people who I know will exceed my expectations. I think everyone needs to stop getting so upset and argue to the death over this and just enjoy the ride for what it is and trust what the writers are doing.TLDR They teaseshow a different origin than in the comics but in the end exceed our expectations of the characters.,arrow,cel28c3,2,t5_2u4js

I mean if Blood was so clean they he wouldnt have had anything to worry about and he would let Laurel dig into him as much as she wanted right? But no the fact that when she was looking into Blood all these bad things happened to her so youd think its a little suspicious. Like why is it that when shes looking into a man thats supposedly clean she gets kidnapped by the man in the mask or that she gets a warrant to have her apartment searched out of the blue? I mean lets face it the only people that can get a warrant like that would be a lawyer or an alderman. It never really crossed his mind that someone else could be wearing that mask for him? Laurel has an excuse to giving up shes shaken up and she lost so much not to mention shes drug addled. Whats Olivers excuse? He really doesnt find that the least bit suspicious for a supposedly clean cut man? His connection to Cyrus should have been enough to alert him.,arrow,cewilzi,4,t5_2u4js

269010,0,t3_1x630n,I do not think it is sexism but just an awful character.  The list of ridiculous things that she has pulled just keeps piling up.  I will name some of them but I doubt I can remember them all.Blaming the Arrow for Tommys death.  She went in that building to go after files and Tommy tried to save her.  The Arrow was busy trying to stop the machines from wrecking the city not focusing on saving Laurel.  To hell with the city and all of its citizens I have to go make sure Laurel is okay and she can get her files.  She tries to have him arrested despite the fact that the Arrow has saved her life numerous times.Blames Oliver for most of season one for causing her sisters death.  Finds out that her sister is alive and she kicks her out.Tries to have Olivers mother put to death.  Instead of asking to be reassigned to a different case but because it is her job.  Then has the audacity to keep running to Oliver for help when she is in trouble.  This is of course after Oliver has repeatedly helped her and saved her life.  How can Laurel and Oliver be together when she tried to have his mother executed an awkward Christmas no?   Those are the three biggest issues for me as a character.Her getting Sarah in trouble because she wanted Oliver was very wrong.Plus just the constant poor me.I really hope that they do not kill Sarah.  I really do not see how anyone could take Laurel seriously as Black Canary.  The writers have surprised me before but I really feel it would be a mistake.  ,arrow,cf8n5td,5,t5_2u4js

The problem is security you need a place that the heroes know about but that none of the villans do otherwise some wacko with an agenda is just going to mess things up.  The problem with the watchtower is that its too public.  With a superhero wedding you could never be sure about security because these are the most clever villans on earth and messing up a superhero wedding makes you cool forever.

691553,0,t1_cginyas,I wanted to write an entire article on this. The Dark Knight Rises attacked Bruce Wayne directly. And with zero supporting characters they didnt have much of a choice. But the direct attack on Bruce Wayne to bring his character down felt boring and uninspired and pointless and indirect and stalling.But here Arrow has a huge cast of characters. No family? Hes got a mom and a sister. Only Alfred? Hes got a bodyguard a tech wiz a girlfriend a sidekick and a cop. He has an ex girlfriend a mayoral candidate a coowner and a former friend turned archvillain. And all this stuff happening at once has a real effect on Oliver and the story. Its a real oh shit moment. Something that even if Slade stopped now would cause major issues that would ruin Olivers life.And as he said death would be a release from this life. Unlike Batman lying around healing not doing much and watching Gotham in more order than it has ever been before there is a real sense of disaster. A real sense of Oliver is here to want to fix this but the odds keep going against him. Its a great obstacle than a broken back. And its a more meaningful betrayal and loss of hope. The large supporting cast helps far far more than ever before. It was worth setting all those characters up.,arrow,cgivqw9,5,t5_2u4js

It is however very disappointing when shows dont live up to the hype,arrow,chmej9a,2,t5_2u4js
1041246,0,t3_26164w,Well said.  Now I cant say I havent hated on laurel at least once during the season but I never overly hated her in general.  Throwing all of these qualities together and reading them in one place....Sir Im aboard the Laurel as BC train.Edit wording,arrow,chmn745,61,t5_2u4js
1042466,0,t3_26164w,  Were setting the bar pretty low for extremely good here. Shes good at it but no where near the level she should be to start professionally ass kicking the bad guys. Especially the type of bad guys were sure to see in the future.       She understandably went through some hard times and has just recently come out of it. Shes nowhere near out of the woods yet. And if they to say she is out of the woods and rush her into the Canary I cant help but have the opinion that her Season  story arc was pointless and insulting to people struggling with real addictions.      Shes going through the remorse thing just like Ollie did in Season . She could easily go back on that and fall into her old ways but we havent seen that happen yet.  Bad chemistry is absolutely a valid excuse because any chemistry that was built in Season  was trashed in Season . They have a lot of work to do if they want to build that chemistry back to the point that Id rather see Ollie becoming close with just about anyone else other than Laurel.    Deadshot and Diggle have more chemistry than Ollie and Laurel for fucks sake.       Laurel in Season  wasnt bad and neither was the acting. I agree in Season  she was pretty inconsistent. This isnt the actress fault I guess I just feel like Laurels story was rushed and set of to the side as if it were less important. And it showed.    To me Laurel has always been a character that just has to have all the attention especially when she deserves none. This is especially apparent to me in season .      And on your point about her being an ethical fighter. Wouldnt that mean she is less likely to become the Canary instead of more likely? Shes fought the bad guys in her own ways and is really great at it. Becoming a vigilante would be going against this ideal shes fought so hard to protect through the entire series.But really the thing that bugs me about it the most is we saw a ton of backstory on Sarah. Ive grown attached to her character. Everytime Ive seen Laurel its rarely something positive. Her story so far is full of whiney temper tantrums and overreactions. The story of her falling into drugs and coming back out again could have been an inspirational one but to me it seemed rushed and shoved off to the side to the point of being incredibly unimportant compared to everything else that was going on with the other characters.   Until they can make me stop groaning when Laurel is on the screen Im really going to miss Sarah and eagerly await her return.  TLDR Holy shit I just realized Diggle and Deadshot have more chemistry than Ollie and Laurel.,arrow,chms718,9,t5_2u4js
1043486,0,t1_chmu321,Well Season  was her Island. I mean here we have Oliver Moira even Roy lying to Thea. Her life is nothing but lies her mother was murdered in front of her and its her brothers fault in her mind shes emotionally frail sick and tired of being lied to and about to die at the hands of a Mirakuru soldier and then here comes her father Malcolm Merlyn who puts everything on the table. No secrets. He warns her about Roy lying to her. After all of this she still doesnt believe him. It wasnt really rushed in my opinion. Malcolm is a user and he stepped in at the exact moment to manipulate Thea to his ends. The whole gun situation in x Streets of Fire was symbolic of her turning Earlier in the episode Oliver tells her she has a pure heart thus when she sees the gun while running from Malcolm she doesnt pick it up. Chats with Malcolm Mirakuru vs. Malcolm she picks the gun up symbolic in herself indicating she is ready to take up a fight against the lies Malcolm tries to talk to her and she shoots him symbolizing she is ready to confront those whom she believes are wronging her. This also cements in her mind she isnt who Oliver said she was. She isnt a Queen shes a murderer like her father. Consider this move similar to Oliver murdering that man in x City of Heroes on the Island. Thea is sick and tired of everyone lying to her. The people she loves the most are gone or liars. Why should she stick with them? In her mind she is more of a Merlyn her father saved her life and there is nothing in Starling for her. Why wouldnt she leave with Malcolm? Very well executed in my opinion.,arrow,chmwdhg,5,t5_2u4js

Saras bisexuality isnt important or defining if they cant kill her because shes bisexual then thats almost as bad as killing her because shes bi.Did Buffy have boycotts when they killed a prominent gay figure in the show? No. Does Walking Dead get boycotted for killing a black character every other week? No. No one really cares unless it is genuinely racist.,arrow,cj6ys8r,6,t5_2u4js

2378555,0,t3_2mlcwn,I can only speak for myself on this. Personally I feel like there are certain actors that nail some roles and it makes it harder for me to see other people in those roles. Christopher Reeve as Superman for example....ICONIC but I couldnt stomach Dean Cain I absolutely hated Brandon Routh and I only half ass like Henry Cavil...he has to get rid of those goofy fucking faces he makes when talking to Lois Amy Adams was so wrong for that role too shoulda gone to someone who looked closer to say Rachel McAdams or Alexis KnappOf course then you have your roles where multiple actors are capable of making it their own   James Bond.  I loved Sean Connery followed by Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. I could even somewhat tolerate Roger Moore after awhile yet others tried and sucked donkey balls  Timothy Dalton George Lazenby....Im looking at you.Some actors are just wrong for certain roles. So far I dont like whats going down with movie Flash. I like tv Flash too much to feel right about somebody else in that suit so soon after and that dude just looks wrong for the part. I dont see him as a nerdish type more as a hipster douche or somebodys gay Korean brother who prefers to wear a Japanese kimono and doesnt really know why. Or even a combination of the two? A gay Korean hipster doucheI could not care less if hes Asian or gay or whatever the point is a lot of things come to mind. Flash isnt one of them.SHIT! Too late.

2564808,0,t3_2p4cg7,My moneys on Ray Palmer being connected to this seasons big bad. He may have called his suit ATOM but its also part of the OMAC project. The DCuniverse had a major plot a few years ago where people were being infected and turned into cyborg drones controlled by an evil AI Brother Eye. Theyve already introduced OMAC in the background before and the midseason finale had Palmer outright referencing OMAC so its either going to come up this season or at very least theyre laying the groundwork for next season.The big players were seeing in the game right now areAmanda Waller  she exists firmly in the moral greyarea in all incarnations so its unlikely shell be a primary antagonist but we have seen that shes employed people who are currently members of the League of Assassins in the past. Clearly shes much more connected to everything weve seen happening this season and must have had dealings with RasRas Al Ghul  He is an extremist. He does terrible things but always believes its for the greater good. That was Merlyns MO in season  so its possible he could have a similar scheme this year. The only reason I dont think hed be the main villain is he has no motivation. Him looking for someone who murdered a member who had recently been cast out of the League isnt really a compelling reason to do anything terrible. He may have stabbed Oliver a bunch but it wasnt out of wrath or malice  in fact he seemed to really respect him.Merlyn  hes becoming more interesting since revealing that he had Thea murder Sarah. Its an interesting gambit since its a guaranteed victory for him both Oliver and Ras are major enemies of Merlyns and his plan would end up with at least one of them dead. My hunch is that since being kicked out of highsociety once his crimes as Malcolm Merlyn came to light and turning the entire League against him he needs to find a new home. Obviously he still has resources as seen from the scenes training Thea but hell never be respected as a civilian again which leaves leadership of the League as his only option. If Ras died Malcolm could fill the void. If Oliver died then hed cement his hold over Thea as her only remaining family and hes lose one of his greatest adversaries.,arrow,cmtcx7u,10,t5_2u4js

2871950,0,t1_cnug573,I definitely see your point I guess I just dont see why it would be something he would care to do.  I thought he showed his version of respect by saying that Ollie lasted longer than most.  Ive always seen Ras as someone who would never hold the life of any one person in high regard.  Bruce Wayne was his greatest student and while he seemed disappointed he was prepared to kill him both in the movie and multiple times throughout their meetings in the comics.Of course this is a different version and things can be different but Ras is consistently depicted as a bigpicture kind of mastermind serving his own twisted greater good  on a global scale leading genocides and all kinds of undertakings that make Merlyns leveling of the glades look like childs play.  For him to revive Oliver imo he would have had to demonstrate some serious skills that I dont think anyone watching that fight would say he showed.  Could have just been a subpar fight scene overallagain imo it was but I really dont think thats where theyre going with it.Guess this is all kind of moot unless Amell is a liar so enjoy the episode as well as Flash tomorrow if youre a fan!,arrow,cnuji8u,2,t5_2u4js

If they can use him only once or twice this season they should not hold back on us!I wonder if only Oliver and Thea will be on LianYu or if Merlyn will be with them.

It greatly reduces swelling and clots blood quicker to minimize blood loss. A stab wound like that you would think Oliver would be found in a pretty big pool of blood but there wasnt. Still besides blood loss theres also the fact that wound probably ruptured or destroyed some organs possibly puncturing a lung too. So it really shouldnt be all that survivable either way.

2987237,0,t1_co7lp9f,they formed a story around Nyssa that made sense for her to come to Starling and that was Sara. But they didnt choose to introduce her because of sara but because of her ties to Ras as that set up Season . Thats what I meant.And the plan was always for Sara to die. Laurel becoming BC was planned before they even shot the Pilot and its the very reason why Katie was interested in the role in the first place. She actually was a bit bummed out when they brought in Caity Lotz as Canary because that was actually the part that Katie wanted to play all along. But when she realized that bringing sara back was ultimately done to service Laurels story and evolution into BC she was all for it. But she really was looking forward to this all along and I think it really shows onscreen. In the last several episodes Katie feels so much more passionate and reinvigorated now. You can really tell that this is what she wanted to do all along and now she is having more fun than ever. I already started to notice that change when Laurel learned Olivers secret. Her whole dynamic shifted after that particularly when she was interacting with Team Arrow after that. I really loved that and I like that while a lot of people hated on her and Laurel she slowly is finding more respect and acceptance now among those who had it in for her. Particularly after the last two episodes I am starting to feel that people are finally accepting her as BC and are moving on from the senseless hating because they see that this was always the plan and you either go with it or you will ruin the show for you. And I think Katie has been absolutely amazing these last few months and particularly since she started going down the Canary path. She looks absolutely perfect as Canary and its fun and interesting to see Black Canary starting at  and then working her way up. Its fun to see her failures and small victories her evolution and her lessons. Its fun to finally see how she became Black canary. we didnt see that before. Not even with Sara. And personally I think that laurel is already further ahead then Oliver was during his first year on the island. If you compare year one islandOliver with current Laurel youll see that Laurel is far more passionate determined and energetic.She greatly reminds me of KickAss. I dont know if you know the graphic novel or movie but KickAss is about this young high school teenager and comic fan who puts on a costume and wants to be a real life superhero. And he has no training whatsoever just a ferocious desire to help people and make a difference. And he gets brutally beaten and stabbed and run over and whatnot but just like Laurel he always gets back up and keeps fighting through sheer will and determination. his actions go viral via youtube and he becomes a star and starts a wave of real life superheroes rising up. None of them are actual heroes just normal people who put on silly costumes but they make a difference with their passion and determination in KickAss  they even form the team Justice Forever. Of course things get really messy when suddenly KickAss finds himself confronted with the actual mob and organized crime. And he gets nearly killed and his father gets murdered but that only gives him even more fire to fight back. To go fuck you I am going to kick the shit out of you.Then he meets HitGirl. Now HG is the opposite of that coin. She is extremely highly trained and every single part of her is lethal despite only being  years old!. her father has raised her to be the ultimate warrior and killer but only killing murderers drug dealers rapists and mob members he has trained her in ways that make Malcolm Merlyns training of Thea look like a day at the patting zoo.So HitGirl aka Mindy is this ultimate badass fighting machine. I mean she could kick Olivers ass all the way to nanda parbat. And Dave aka KickAss is this guy in a costume without any training who gets his ass handed to him over and over but keeps coming back and back and back and is full of passion and fire and determination. So basically Mindy is Oliver and Dave is Laurel. But then over time Dave gets better. he gets trained by Mindy and he gets more confident more accurate until around the time of KickAss  and definitely by KickAss  he is a formidable fighter. Not on Mindys level Though he would have eventually gotten there if he had continued his life as KickAss but he turns from this nerd in a costume who got the shit beat out of him by street thugs to this superhero symbol who takes on the mob itself in the finale of the series.And I think thats very similar to Laurel. She wears the costume she has the spirit the passion the determination and she keeps coming  no matter what. And much like Dave had Mindy Laurel has Team Arrow to push her and forge her.I think its such a great idea to not show Laurel as the supreme superhero that she is in the comics just yet. But to show where she comes from where that hero came from and how she became that. Its such a great message that Katie embodies right now with her role. That even if you dont have training and skills and are not a superhero supreme if you have passion and willpower and the determination to make a difference and if you will keep coming back no matter how often you fail or get beat down  thats something to look up to and believe in. Its the message that being a hero doesnt start with skill and muscle  it starts with heart and spirit. And I just love that. And to see how out of that the Black Canary will be born like a diamond emerging from coal  that is so empowering and as a comic book fan of the character emotionally satisyfing.Laurel and Katie had it tough on the show because they had to be broken down to rise up. Oliver went through the same so did Sara. We just didnt witness their lowest all too much.In the end its just like Ras al Ghul said in Batman BeginsTraining means nothing will is everything. The will to actThat is current Laurel in a nutshell.,arrow,co7mhdc,4,t5_2u4js

3050134,0,t3_2v2zvd,While I wholeheartedly agree on the Felicity points I think The Flash romance stuff is actually interesting. Its rarely taking the forefront and when it does its far more believable than the stuff in Arrow. Spoilers for FlashI mean Snow growing a fondness for Barry makes sense. They both work closely together they both are intelligent scientist types theyre both about the same age and they both are being ignored by the people theyre pining for. Thats more than enough common interests to spark a relationship. But in contrast besides being superheroes Felicity and Oliver have no common interests. Oliver is an old school sort of detective Felicity is a  Haxrz. Oliver is in his mid thirties Felicity is in her mid twenties. Oliver is willing to do what it takes to get shit done Felicity is hopelessly optimistic about everything. Oliver grew up in a lap of luxury Felicity had a hard upbringing. They just dont share anything that would spark a romantic relationship and thats what makes it feel forced.Her and Ray though share way more common interests than her and Oliver which is why I find that relationship far more palatable. Theyre highlyintelligent nerds theyre both highly optimistic and they both lost someone Well she thought she lost someone.

I think thats a real human thing to do. Also lets not forget that Felicity is one that held team arrow together when she thought Oliver was dead.  It took her all of about ten seconds to turn him into an ideal which is about right for a hero and when he came back and didnt live up to her ideal shes upset.  bug shock.

3087295,0,t3_2v34va,Hello there. Im super late to the Redditparty but needed to find a place to exert all my fanboyishness. I love your theory!I hate to say it but Im kind of on board with Diggle becoming a GL. First off I really dont see how this particular rumor would pop up if there wasnt some value to it. Team Arrow is too populated. Somebody is going to have to go and really out of everybody Diggle is the prime candidate. As much as I would rather it be Laurel and Im not really a Laurel hater.Heres how I see it going down. My theory isnt as intricate as yours but I dont see it being that expansive unless it happens on The Flash.At the midseason finale of season  the story arc will lead to Diggle having to drop everything and leave. Perhaps something goes wrong with the Suicide Squad or a past enemy targets his family. Whatever the means it would have to be a large enough problem that the simplest solution is for Dig to pack up and head out seemingly for good. He is getting his affairs in order with the help of Argus. He is saying his goodbyes to Team Arrow and as he leaves he mentions that Waller suggested a name change ala Stewart. Thats the end of that.Fast forward to end of season  possibly even . Team Arrow cant handle the threat. Ollie is the last man standing one arrow left. Shoots. Its caughtdeflectedyou get the idea. Villain scoffs remarks how there is nobody left to help moves in for the kill then BOOM.Villain is hit with something very large and green. John flies down to help Ollie up. insert witty Diggle comment Dig finishes the job.Fin.From that point on Dig only appears occasionally respecting that Ollie doesnt necessarily want any super help in his crusade. He is explained away by being off of the planet or appearing in the Flash and entering into a Hal Jordan arc. Maybe the guardians explain to John that Hal needs to be found and John seeks Barrys help mostly for the sake of having Hal and Barry together. Perhaps the explanation of John getting the ring instead of Hal has to do with a time traveling villain kidnapping Hal expecting the interference to eliminate GL not realizing the ring would go to somebody else.I realize I went on a bit of a ramble there at the end but you see what Im getting at.,arrow,cohzvni,1,t5_2u4js

His defeating three LoA mooks who are pretty good might place him there.. Ollie.. Nyssa. Gave Ollie a decent fight but size and strength do give an advantage to our Emerald Archer. . Unpowered Slade. I might change my mind on that one next week since well truly see then a fair fight between an Ollie in his prime and a Slade who got time to readjust to his lack of powers.. Wintergreen. Slightly below Slade. Sara. Lack of striking power makes her lose places here. She is very skilled to make up for that though.. Huntress. Good but bloodlusted Sara wipes the floor with her.. The average LoA mook who is able to make Ollie know that he has been in a fight.. Dig should be around here.. Wildcat. Id place Ted higher in skill but his lack of stamina as seen against Brick makes him lose points. Roy.. Quentin Lance preheart condition. Dudes good enough to get the drop on LoA members.. Laurel.

3276163,0,t3_2xn53s,gt  People seem to think because she doesnt want to side with Oliver all the time she is being bitchy.This isnt the argument anyone is making. I hate when people throw up a defence to something that no one is attacking them for. She isnt bitchy because she doesnt agree with Oliver shes bitchy because of the rather immature way she goes about voicing her disagreements with him. Seriously when was the last time she did so without eithera raising her voice in any wayb throwing in any insults or purposefully hurtful remarks  subtle or otherwise  which have no relevance or place in the argument tip they never doc appealing to emotion d walking away before any rational discussion can even be hadI dont think shes a bitch. I think shes hurting emotionally and thats fine. But seriously no character  favourite or otherwise  should be immune from criticism. Felicitys writing has been poor this season. In fact everyones writing for the most part has been pretty poor this season. And please dont think Im mistaking poor writing for character development just because theyre acting differently than they did in the past two seasons because thats not what it is.  ,arrow,cp1pjbb,0,t5_2u4js

3361565,0,t3_2yo6lk,This is a neat idea and Im not trying to shoot it down or anything the writers have definitely let opportunities open for them to include the original trinity members but what I believe they are doing at their core is establishing a new trinity or quartet potentially that thematically matches elements from the original while also bringing in fresh ideas.Each of the three trinity members represents certain characteristics and has certain traits. In simple terms and building on what you mentioned this is my interpretations of the characters please fill in or correct me if Im wrong!Batman Experience ruthlessness pragmatism and dark past techsavySuperman Alien from a lost planet superpowered almost godlike in a mythological kind of way symbol of hope and general goodnessWonder Woman Warrior princess outsider somewhat superpoweredin a literal mythological kind of way also blends in to the magic aspect fights for equality I think that the central characters the writers are introducing now can thematically match a lot of the characteristics of the original trilogy while also being different enough to make it their own.Green Arrow The not so subtle equivalent of Batman for the Arrowverse pretty much directly matches all the characteristics listed above but also has some more unique traits dealing with family balancing his identitythought not really at the moment learning not to kill learning to have partners as well as protegesThe Flash Brings in the sciencetech aspect that Batman would usually cover and is the more encouraging and bright symbol of hope closely matching Superman in that regard. Also brings all of the Flash traits over which are amazing legacyfamily time travel destiniesfate etc.Now from this point on its pure speculation because the characters havent been established but it is my prediction that Vixen and possibly Supergirl if brought into canon will fill out the remaining traits between Superman and Wonder Woman while also bringing in their own like The Flash.Supergirl Alienoutsider from a doomed planet seeking to bring hope justice and equality. Superpowered etc.Vixen To be honest I dont know anything about this character or their larger goal for her. But I think the plan is to bring in the magic aspect that WW usually would. Maybe someone else can follow up on how she could fit in?But my interpretation is that they are establishing a new trinityquartet which cover similar aspects but will pay homage to and represent characteristics of the original trinity. It allows them to cover all the main ideas and stories while also getting to create something of their own. Not to mention that itd be pretty rough to just bring in all the original trinity members and have them upstage all the current headliners characters and actors...And again none of this is to say that the original trinity doesnt exist just that even if they do they probably wont have the same representation that they are known for. Theyll probably just be alluded to at best to encourage development towards themwhat they represent ie. for Supergirl and potentially Nightwing if Titans is made canon.,arrow,cpbfz10,4,t5_2u4js
3361671,0,t1_cpamf7r,Luke Cage Jessica Jones Iron Fist and the Defenders wont overlap. Theyll be about  months apart and dropping all at once. So by the time one of those airs the other has already stopped and been watched by everyone who wanted too.,arrow,cpbgeq4,1,t5_2u4js
3367768,0,t1_cpc1g44,Yeah theyre not too much in conditions of having the right state of mind to start a happy relationship in this season but hey this show is confirmedly  seasons minimal and A LOT OF SHIT could happen until then to build up their relationship again  but I still doubt the showrunner will manage to translate their romance like in the comics because of how their live action personalites are so different from the comics. And I can honestly tell you that I vividly felt their attraction to each other in season  when both were okay and The Undertaking fiasco hadnt yet taken misery to a next level. There was still a nice spark in season  with Laurels alcoholic arc her discovering his identity and everything. I can totally see the two of them still happening. But youre right about Felicity. She is also amazing and I love her character so much. I just think its unnecessary to religiously make her be in love with Oliver for the shipper fanss sake. Her character was so much better as just a friend back in the earlier seasons. I think her love arc with Oliver could end there in season  where both have already gotten in so much fights with each other that words are almost over. Id rather have her wandering around the newly born DCTV universe and being funny and thrilling while kissing a lot of guys or girls so they can become superheroes too BTW I would love to see Felicity taking part in a mutiny against Oliver if the plot ever gets this shitty.,arrow,cpc5g56,1,t5_2u4js

I firmly stated that they will never appear onscreen. So my point was never about wether they should appear onscreen or not.

Arrow and flash are beyond amazing for what they are. but being TV shows they arent really even in the same league.

3416183,0,t3_2zchv9,yeah I have absolutely no idea how they are going to bring her back. a headshot is pretty final. Plus she was buried. Somehow I doubt its the Lazarus Pit that would be too cheap and easy and I hope that the Lazarus Pit doesnt become this universal excuse to bring people back from the dead. In fact I confess I am a bit disappointed that Arrow is now following that cliched old comic trope and brings people back from the dead. It makes death less profound and real on the show and I always liked that Arrow had this realistic setting so when people died you know it was for real with no turning back. If they start to bring back one character after another then eventually death loses its meaning on the show and its like So what? Theyll be resurrected anyway and you really lose that emotional weight of death. ,arrow,cpho3rg,0,t5_2u4js

I remember lots of people saying Smallville shouldve taken this kind of approach. In season  there were nonstop comparisons with Agents of SHIELD and people were saying how DC shows are much better than Marvel shows etc. Now that its season  the writing on Flash is kicking Arrows ass right now and Id argue that Agents of SHIELD has been better this season than season  of Arrow.Comparisons are inevitable and if it will increase the quality of the program than I think its welcome.,arrow,cplkfl8,5,t5_2u4js

3465633,0,t1_cpn7u2p,Just for reference on the imdb character elimination game Oliver and Laurel are at the top spot right nowOliver QueenThe Arrow  Laurel LanceBlack Canary  Roy HarperArsenal  John Diggle  Quentin Lance  Eliminated . Amanda Waller . Felicity Smoak . Lyla Michaels . Malcolm MerlynDark Archer . Ras al Ghul . Maseo YamashiroSarab . Ted GrantWildcat . Ray Palmer . Nyssa al Ghul . Tatsu Yamashiro . Thea Queen Again this is a very small and not at all representative sample of the Arrow fansviewers. The only thing is proves is that Laurel is NOT as universally disliked as some Arrow fans often claim even on this subreddit and that Felicity isnt as universally adored as her fans like to believe. In fact the characters who this sample of fans think are the most deserving to livesurvive are the members of the comic book original team of Ollie DinahLaurel and Roy. Im sure that if you do ask the tumblr Arrow bloggers or the members of any other fan space dominated by FelicityOlicity fans it will be the fancreated Original Team ArrowOriginal Trio of DiggleFelicityOliver that will be the most popular. So any poll can only show the prevalent sentiments among a few members of a specific fan space. However I do agree that there are a lot more Laurel fans out there than what some people like to think.

3566622,0,t1_cpypb3j,In the interrogation room with Team Arrow he said he would plead guilty provided the prosecutor did not pursue any charges against them.  At the very least Oliver provided some videotaped confession before being sent to jail.  Prison only comes after youve been convicted in a court of law.This is all very screwed up.  Oliver should have turned himself in and plead not guilty.  Theres nothing to associate Queen with The Arrow.  Even being led to the Arrow lair doesnt prove beyond reasonable doubt that Queen is The Arrow.  None of these idiots including the Chief of Police seem to have an inkling about how the US judicial system works.Hint You can commit murder multiple times and get away with it.

Ideally they should because it would be awesome and make so much sense to us the fans but on the back end there would constant fights for who gets the prime time slots each day who gives up this day for that day this time slot for that one.  I imagine discussions like that leaving no one happy or confident which would logically lead a company one that desires as much profit as possible to show that they are thriving and a good stock option to just walk away and not do it.,arrow,cq75mka,4,t5_2u4js

There is no imbalance of major Asian characters that are villains. Hell even Nyssa has turned towards a more good side since part of Season . Excusing white washing because Asian people are too villainous is a terrible argument since thats no the case with Arrow at all. Not to mention they could always add more Asian characters that were good if too many villainous Asians were too much for them. If theyre gonna take our stories and our characters they need to deal with the fact that were not going to be white. ,arrow,cq8f9x8,2,t5_2u4js

3722159,0,t3_3309zo,My main complaint with Arrow is that it has fallen off from the awesomeness of seasons one and two.

I still like the show but not as much as I did at this point in time for season two. Daredevil overlaps a lot with Arrow but removes a lot of the things that have started to annoy me.

3741919,0,t3_339jk9,Why should Oliver believe anything Ras says he is a mass murderer? What kind of hero gives into the villains demands when the villain tells him its the right thing to do? He isnt interested in taking over an international terrorist organization in the crazy chance he can change it. If anyone believes Ras for a minute they are delusional it is called the League of Assassins. Ras saying nice things about it to sell it to Oliver doesnt change that. Dismantling the League of Assassins is the dumbest thing anyone could ever do because that would make a bunch of trained killers jobless. Also Oliver has seen the monsters the League of Assassins has created first hand. Oliver had heard lots of horrific stories about the League of Assassins.Oliver would have to abandon everything he has right now because he would have to devote himself to the League of Assassins. Felicity reminds him that he would be abandoning Roy and Thea.Oliver wants to be the Arrow. This was established in SE. His motivations for wanting this are explained there. The only reason Oliver even considered it is because he wasnt sure of himself. Once he became sure of his identity of the Arrow he refused the offer.,arrow,cqisxgt,16,t5_2u4js
3746349,1,t1_cqj8v41,Yes! That is so true! Ive also got my share of downvotes for purely supporting Felicity and Olicity! Youre not liked here if you do not ship Laurel or Laurel with Oliver. Well.. Couldnt care less!,arrow,cqjb4v3,1,t5_2u4js
3748095,0,t1_cqj8rh4,So Ras said that Oliver could change the mission of the League if he wanted to.  Yay.Ras has devoted himself completely to the mission of the League for God knows how long.  The League is his family both literally and figuratively and the work they do is his legacy.  Do you really think hes gonna let some dogooder waltz in and change the centuries old mission that Ras believes in with every fibre of his being and turn the League of Assassins into some League of Pacifists Who Dont Really Wanna Hurt Anyone?  Hell no.Ras will hang around and remain in charge until such time as Olivers been indoctrinated into the League and made to believe in its mission as it stands.  That could take years maybe even decades of Oliver having to be a loyal follower and obey orders including killing people if Ras tells him to.  Only after Ras deems Oliver ready would he give up his life so that Oliver could take over the leadership.  Ras wont deem Oliver ready until he believes in the mission of the League as it has always been.  So when he says If you dont want them to kill when youre in charge they wont kill he can easily say that because he knows that by the time Olivers allowed to be in charge hell be all about the killing.,arrow,cqjiano,2,t5_2u4js

3763001,0,t1_cql0pk0,Stephen as an actor had Oliver show much more emotion after Quentin burnt the chicken amp Laurel took too many sips of wine last season than he did with Oliver being kicked from a mountain top and Thea dying. Its pretty ridiculous.At least with Katie Cassidy playing Laurel shes able to express how every life altering event in Laurels life has affected her character. Shes far different from the original Laurel Lance that was introduced and she clearly is in for major changes in the future too. You can get the sense that Laurels been through a lot but shes getting better at life.  It just really ticks me off how most of the praise for Stephen Amell comes off the backs off the other actors who actually carry him through the scenes. Outside of certain delusional Olicity shippers or Arrow clickbait articles I almost never hear Stephens acting be praised with a straight face unless it involves an experienced and talented actor doing most of the work. Its either Katie Cassidy Paul Blackthorne Susanna Thompson and David Ramsey bringing in their A game just for fans to give more of the credit to Stephen instead. Its not fair to any of the actual decent actors. I honestly dont believe any of the reviewers actually think Stephen or Emily can act. But as long as they praise them people will flock to their articles and theyll get exposure and money for it. ,arrow,cql7kwf,2,t5_2u4js

From a writing standpoint they may choose for her not to be dead as to not cheapem death I imagine they had this in mind with Ollies fight with Ras. Of course they may have kept him alive in order to not cheapen the Lazarus Pits.

3860826,0,t1_cqwcenj,Well it is a reasonable assumption because the writers have said multiple times that there is a  year plan for the series although they could go beyond that. CW shows have a long history of spanning multiple seasons so I say there is a good chance that it could surpass that. Stephan Amell is directly quoted as saying gt Oliver has a back story and we have a plan to tell that back story over five seasons Thats the plan.So while Arrow may end the world in which Arrow has created will exist for a LONG time. Flash should spawn at least  seasons which LOADS of potential for spinoff characters to hold their own show. The new spin off is a good indication of that. How spectacular would it be in  years to see Stephan Amell guess star on say a NIGHTWING show longgg after Arrow has ended? Source  ,arrow,cqwda8f,14,t5_2u4js

Anyone who knows who Deathstroke is would pinpoint that in a second. He still used swords and guns he was a master of hand to hand combat he had the costume its the same character.

If the same show had been delivered by him or if they had watched it without knowing he wasnt doing it they would still have liked it. All the most common criticisms of season  are based on an extension of what was happening in the show towards the end of season .Season  was awful. Concept episode after concept episode. The show had no room to breathe. It took away a good deal of character development that we had seen in earlier seasons brought in new dull and unlikeable characters and in general just didnt do anything. ,arrow,cr3eby3,1,t5_2u4js

3927216,0,t1_cr3tu2q,I completely agree I dont care one way or the other if it gets confirmed or not I just want it to be confirmed in one direction so it ends and the show can move on. If I were to pick though Id prefer this whole incident with Oliver lying to Diggle and Felicity and fake killing him to make them realize hes kind of crazy. Diggle realizes he cant trust Oliver anymore and becomes a possible antagonist and Felicity realizes she cant be with someone who could be so callous and Olicity permanently dies. The only good takeaway from this whole shitty scenario being that Oliver realizes he has to stop being so manipulative which ultimately inspires him to become the classic Green Arrow. ,arrow,cr3xs9b,8,t5_2u4js

Ive been following Arrow on Facebook probably not for much longer! and if you read the comments on their posts most of them are loving all of this nonsense.

However there is also a lot bad writing especially with Felicity this season. During season  the Laurel was the character with the worst writing so hate was directed at her with a large majority of the fandom disliking her character. In season  though the character with the worst writing in a lot of peoples opinion has been Felicity. But because she is a popular character a lot of people jump to defend her. This type of hate is not new just it is finally being directed towards a once popular character if Laurel was popular before the bad writing then we would have had this happen last year.,arrow,cr9zx34,2,t5_2u4js

4005166,1,t3_36cn47,Honestly I just want to forget this season. To me the only good thing that came from it was the prospect of a changed Oliver with Merlyn lurking in the shadows. I really wish I enjoyed it like you OP but I disagree with everything unfortunately. Ill say why just to add to discussion. Pretty standard opening episode didnt care about Sara dying because I expected her to come back and guess what she is.. I couldnt care less about the killer thing. I have enough of whodunnit shit from soaps and I feel they could have gotten to it much quicker than they did. I didnt even realise it was Thea when it was revealed because I just really wasnt invested in the season.. Eh the Flash part was better because I loved seeing the characters interact in a much lighter environment. Seeing Diggle with those chips was just beautiful. I will admit though the crossover offered a good contrast between the two with Barry absolutely hating Olivers methods. That was well done.. I disagree on the fight being well done. To me there were far too many times Oliver should have done something differently and hed have won. Ras just didnt seem strong and it felt like he won purely because of the way the choreography made him have to win. Matt Nable did nothing wrong I just feel the way they dressed him and the storyline they gave him just made him appear quite mediocre. End of the day Ras is bigger than Oliver Queen. I really dont like the idea of him dying even though I enjoyed the Merlyn thing at the end. This was not a Ras who faces Batman it was a much watered down and weakened version to fit Green Arrow.. Cant comment on it Ive completely forgotten it except the ending because of the memes that were here about Ras Arrow. . It felt like the latter S episodes in terms of scale and I really enjoyed that however once again it was quite a forgettable episode for me and I had to check the wiki to even remember what episode it was.. It was well done before they added in the oh no Felicity hugged Oliver she still loves him thing from Ray. Also hope Roy goes to the Titans show and is the link between Flarrowverse and that show. No idea if theyre canon yet so having him in it would more or less confirm it.. I absolutely hated the finale. So incredibly underwhelming. Im not a fan of the flashbacks but fair play last year the way flashback Oliver and normal Oliver fought with Slade was so fucking good. This year I didnt give a single fuck what was going on in the past. I knew Akio was gonna die and the way his dad left was so fucking shit. Ras just cannot die like that it was incredibly underwhelming. Oh and who can forget the absolute episode ruiner that was What! Ray! No! Oliver!!!!. It summed up the season for me unfortunately. This was not the Arrow I know. The main storyline was weak in my opinion they gave us such an underwhelming Ras and most importantly fan favourite characters turned to shit or got underused. Too much repetition going on and every time a new secret was found out and people got annoyed I just kept thinking of how the Flash revealed shit straight away and Iris was the only one with an Arrowesque reaction to finding stuff out late.Ill forget about the season besides the ending. Im looking forward to the future for that reason alone even if it felt like fan fiction. Honestly though if next season is anywhere as mediocre as this one ill be sticking to just Flash and Legends which says something since I rarely quit shows. edit Cheers for the downvote from whoever would much rather hide behind an archaic system as opposed to actually discussing. ,arrow,crctior,-4,t5_2u4js
4007244,0,t1_crd1ipb,A lot of people take team arrows friendship for granted. You dont go through that much shit with someone and then let them die when you have so much time to save them. The only reason Olicity is so prevalent is because its been building up since the first season and its the last victory Oliver had to get for him to finally move on from the dark part of his life. Now hes going to come back as the lovestruck Green Arrow that we know from the comic books. Anyone who ever resented the overly dramatic Oliver and is now resenting his relationship with Felicity is kind of a hypocrite. But oh well.,arrow,crd21bb,1,t5_2u4js

4008612,0,t3_36casd,I really liked how well they interwove Arrow and The Flash together this year. You got this sense that yah these two shows are happening at the same time ie Barry summoning Oliver to the roof in xx Cisco making the Canary Cry Felicity not being present for most of x because she was on The Flash x and of course the massive crossovers. I think the only time that broke down was Ray and Felicitys trip to Central City and that was largely due to network interference.Ray Palmer in general. Loved him from the trailer at SDCC last year. Then he became the Ultimate Good Guy. I may also have a tiny mancrush on him.The friendship between Laurel and Felicity. The CW could have easily made this the whole catty former love interest vs current love interest thing for MORE DRAMA but they didnt. They became friends.Laurels redemption. Coming out of Season  I hated Laurel. I knew why the writers did what they did with her gotta hit rock bottom before you and start climbing again but I still hated the character not the actress Katie Cassidy is great. Hell even when I heard that they were making her Black Canary this season I was like WTF. But they did it fairly well and Im all kinds of psyched to see her and Speedy kicking ass next year. Mama Smoak whenever she showed up. She immediately induced that feeling we all know of our parents completely embarrassing us in front of our friends. She needs to come back for Season . Can you imagine the comedy gold there?Early pre xish Felicity. I agree with some of the criticisms of her in the back end I think she was justified in emoting and all that but I agree it was a little over the top. But early on? Felicity was the same adorkable geek that we loved in S. I mean cmon SHE PISTOL WHIPPED that asshat ex of hers in x. Also anytime she was with Ray in the nd half okay that BUT OLIVER thing was cringeworthy. I just hope that she goes back to being the adorkable nerd we love in S.And Im going to say it. Im completely okay with Oliver and Felicity being together at the end. I will grant that they completely fumbled it through the back of their own end zone no less! in the back end but the front end was some of the delicious Will they or wont they that I love so much,arrow,crd7ncl,3,t5_2u4js

4018591,0,t1_crec5h5,gtHe didnt do it because Merlyn cares for Thea he couldnt give two shits about that. He did it because he had valuable skills and intel on the LoA.Handing over Merlyn to the League got both Oliver and Thea out of danger and Thea tells Oliver that. Oliver didnt need him anymore at that point. He was putting himself back in danger. Oliver never claims when he rescues Merlyn that he is doing this because he needs. Oliver only begins to need Merlyn again after Ras al Ghuls offer. Oliver says he rescued Merlyn to save Theas soul and his ego made him want to fight Ras again which wouldnt have happened if he hadnt decided to assault Nanda Parbat from his perspective as he thought Thea released him from the Leagues wrath.gtI will still say she does. She may be helping Oliver and them do their jobs but she wasnt stuck on an island for years with the need to kill to survive. She wasnt a member of the LoA.She isnt anymore nave than Laurel currently is. In fact I would argue Laurel was extremely nave in the first season to the point where she couldnt understand that the law didnt always work. Felicity has dealt with her dead boyfriend and almost getting arrested and whatever her father is.gtI will argue that her suggesting Oliver not to worry about his rule for certain circumstances just shows her lack of knowledge of his experiences and what it is really like. She still has a sheltered mindset of what it is like to kill a person.I disagree. In a way Felicity has had similar experiences her boyfriend died because of her virus. Despite it not necessarily being her fault she likely felt guilty about it. I think she can empathize with murdering someone just as much as Thea and Roy can. Laurel of course has killed people so her case is different.gtSo sure she is capable of being more ruthless than her earlier self but that really just isnt saying much and it has nothing to do with why shed make a good partner for him.She is way less nave than Laurel was in season one.,arrow,creclsi,1,t5_2u4js

4049303,0,t1_crhtnsp,I see we have some common ground here with the way Laurels situation was handled on the show. There was hardly any trace of a real depression shown it was pushed too far into the background to be noticed as a depression and yes offensive to people suffering that same problem because being depressed does not just mean to be a whiny easily offended mess too arrogant to admit their own mistakes and repeat them over and over again making them worse. Like you said if this was the way they handled a severe depression it was rather offensive which is why even depressed people would not recognise the depression. You shouldnt assume everyone who doesnt understand her has no idea about depression  on the contrary. Its more that the way that depressed people often have this heavy selfdoubt in pretty much everything they do and we never once saw that in Laurel. She was always the one dictating the moral ground always the one to judge and take action before she reflected on it. She was shown in the way depressed people do not want to be seen the way I would not want to be seen. Back to the killing people we dont like I dont think people in general judge female characters that much stronger. They really just stand out so much in one direction. There are certain character traits that result in strong reactions and even more so when the character is very emotional  an attribute usually considered to be female. Its the overdrawn way the female character is like and less the character being female. On top of that there are very few wellwritten women on TV. On the male side the poor guys are hardly ever allowed to show their feelings or they are considered not manly enough. I wonder what reaction a male character that cries very often would get but the only occasion that happens on TV are gay guys and they are judged on another basis just to make it clear I neither approve of gender specific stereotypes nor of those of sexual orientation its just an observation. Of course there are some men who only judge a woman based on the looks and I have met quite a few of them in this subreddit and they dont want to see a crying girl but some long blonde hair and deep cleavage. Cant help with them but I think the a bit more sophisticated viewers dont judge women more harshly because of their gender but because of the typically female traits on TV.,arrow,crhuoc1,0,t5_2u4js

4063598,0,t1_crjgaue,When at full draw with a bow all of the tension of the shot should be in your back between your shoulder blades. Theas pose here puts the tension in her bicep which while still effective in firing the shot will cause quicker fatigue to the muscle and thus more variation to the successive shots. Also when at full draw and with proper form an archer needs an anchor point. This means that your draw hand the one holding onto the string and arrow nock should be anchored to your face in some way. With archers that have a sight on their bow this anchor is usually putting the last two knuckles of your index finger under your jaw. With non sight shooters like Thea is here the anchor is usually placing the same knuckles on the cheekbone to better line up your eyesight with the arrow. Also just looking at her stance shes parallel to her target while a more experienced archer would be perpendicular with your feet and torso facing away from the target. This could all be chalked up to Willa not being able to properly deliver her lines with a properly anchored arrow or the hood hindering how she could turn her head for the scene but its still annoying to people who know their archery form.,arrow,crjh9f2,1,t5_2u4js

4529426,0,t1_ct1jf83,im not looking for any confirmation bias because it already happened to me.  i was threatened and ive only been here for a few months.  thats my experience.  good for you that you havent had that happen but someone saying they wanted to nail my guts to the wall is more scary to me than someone having a conspiracy theory about kc.   so internet has many conspiracy theories. kc probably never even seen it.  thus for me reddit is not the same as tumblr. no one has ever threatened me on there but they have here.  one poster was implying that the anti felicity folks were basically the whole fandom  or that eps should listen to this sub im not sure what he meantwhy are they ignoring us?  but it certainly came from a place of entitlement that we should dictate the show.  the second poster mentioned reddit bad reputation which to me is valid there have been really bad press lately and for years about reddit.  between my own personal experience being threatened on this sub and all that i would say that reddit has a worse reputation than tumblr.   but lets face it reddit doesnt do trending retweets social media advertising for the show that tumblrtwitters does which is the real reason that we arent being listened to.  there is no free press free pr from them from reddit.   a bunch of folks talks about arrow isnt going to get them mentioned in other mediumstv channelstwitterstumblr accounts.  edithere is the comment i received a couple of months ago.spoilers The Iconic Trio in SE Public Enemy from CanaryLover via rarrow sent  minutes ago show parent I really have had it with your constant put downs and bullshit.

In contrast zombie movies all suffer from being too short to depict the overall story of an apocalypse which is what Walking Dead is all about How the characters evolve as the series goes on. You mentioned Game of Thrones as well I think that character driven stories are better on TV and Game of Thrones is a great example as I dont think Id be invested in the characters if it were a movie.

5019588,0,t1_cur1rdx,No no no. There is nothing wrong with change. But the change needs to make sense. They can have character development for Felicity that doesnt involve being part of the action or obsessing over Oliver. The development theyve given her is just contrived drama. It doesnt flow. It barely makes sense. I LOVED Felicity in seasons  and . She doesnt have to remain static but she does deserve GOOD development. ,arrow,cur1v3o,34,t5_2u4js

Im guessing theyre going to go along with the whole the island has mystical properties theyve shown in comics and that theyre farming something special heck it might even be the key ingredient to mirakuru.I hope the mayoral candidacy is more aimed at him becoming the social conscience he has been in comics rather than them treading on comic book ground. I think its a solid idea either way though and makes sense when you think about it. He can protect himself unlike other candidates and he wont be squeezed like Blood was and as Oliver he seemed to garner a lot of sympathy for his time on the island and the change he underwent.The show keeps improving although i think Laurels haste in digging up Sara is insane but i get that too.,arrow,cw0a80n,1,t5_2u4js

They can pick and choose the DNA bits that make up a perfect soldier but discard any bits that contribute to pesky humanity type emotions.  Ghost!Andy got a glitch in his mainframe when he saw someone he recognised as his brother.  Maybe he was part of Phase  before theyd quite worked out all the kinks in the process.  Theyre real enough in a physical sense but theyre not  who they used to be when they were originally alive because by rights they should still be dead and theyre not quite all there kinda sorta like Sara and Thea but a bit different.

Laurel behaved a little suspicious though waiting right outside the door at a spot where she could intercept intruders rather than one of the comfier places in the hallway.

Not fun at all.There is no way the show can redeem laurel after these  seasons. I think there are two possible solutions both suck. Kill off Laurel let Sara honor Laurel and take the mantle of Black Canary and become the Black Canary that we love in the comics. But thats going to piss off a lot of stubborn comic book fans. Its fine by me but just look at Gotham.The other solution is to let go of her. Bring her back after half a season or so. One or two episode just about what she is doing when she was gone. Magically become the Black Canary we love.

5791647,0,t1_cxey8g2,Best is sort of tough to quantify enjoyment is a little easier. I recognize that Jessica Jones and Daredevil are better made but id argue Flash at least for me is the better show.Gonna do a list again because its an easy way to sort my thoughts.... Although they arent high profile performances I find many of the characters in the Flash  for the most part are very easy to like. Where in Daredevil I only really care for Matt Fisk and Wesley as I mentioned Kilgrave was the only character I felt any sort of interest in when it comes to Jessica Jones. From a creative standpoint theyve handled many of the comic elements in a interesting capacity and have in their own way put some fun spins on things. Where not to bash Daredevil and Jessica Jones but it often feels like theyre both portrayed as people who can take a beating rather than people with actual powers. Daredevil seemed to handle this a little better towards the end and for all I know season  will go a step beyond but as is it leaves something to be desired. The show does a great job of keeping you hyped for whats on the horizon while still making the stuff thats in the moment interesting. Far from an easy thing to do   As far as finales go which im a sucker for Flash ended the first season on a really awesome note that delivered on a number of levels. I didnt find the finales to Daredevil or Jessica Jones particularly satisfying.  ,arrow,cxf0bhg,1,t5_2u4js

5882897,0,t1_cxq62g4,Truly that was the major killer of the LaurelOliver ship to me back in S and S. I knew Green Arrow and Black Canary dated in the comics so thats what I expected from the show. But Arrow started off with such a toxic basis cheated on her with Sara at fault for the death of Sara cheated with other women that it made Laurel look like a spineless doormat for constantly taking back Oliver without Oliver truly repenting for his crimes. The S love triangle between Laurel Tommy and Oliver really didnt help matters either. I actually rooted for Tommy to turn evil and cause some major damage to the other two because he didnt deserve all that drama.Stephen Amell and Katie Cassidy both wouldve needed Matt Bomer levels of charisma in order to sell such a relationship as plausible. That level of connection and chemistry just wasnt there which made the LaurelOliver ship a dud to me.,arrow,cxqs4a3,2,t5_2u4js

6467352,0,t1_czo4osr,Spoiler for SHIELDs Grant Ward is the enemy. Hes a villain. They always try to kill him. Actually even when they tried not to kill him because they needed him they couldnt help themselves. So I dont think hes anything like Malcolm. Not to mention the fact that hes a product of Whedon family so he has a planned character arc. Hes written very good. Hes been a prominent character in an ensemble cast. They dont push him into every story in every episode. They apparently are not making it up as they go like they do with Malcolm Merlyn. I didnt watch the other shows you mentioned but I imagine you are right unfortunately... Spoiler for Flashs Flash has Harrison Wells too. Though it is not disastrous yet. But I dislike how rest of the characters cannot distinguish between Thawne and Wells... They still act like it was Harrison Wells in season .,arrow,czo9q6a,1,t5_2u4js

It doesnt flow well.

6485572,0,t1_czpuy93,Felicitys an extremely empathetic person when it comes to seeing her friends suffer. I think watching Laurel lose her father could do that to her.That said Im thinking either Diggle or Felicitys mom. I know Stephen Amells tweet reaction suggests team Arrow but perhaps theres some heinous way it happens instead of an unbelievable person it happens to. And it would go farther toward explaining Felicitys rage.,arrow,czq5mxp,1,t5_2u4js
6485582,0,t3_44f7wu,Diggle Thea Laurel in that order. Diggle because he and Oliver have a great relationship. For Oliver Diggle is the person he wants to be. Killing Diggle will make Oliver think he cant be that person because it ends badly. If Diggle couldnt have his happy ending Oliver cant. Itd be like a bucket of ice over him. Thea because shes Olivers sister. Hes seen her change so much since he returned from the island and in that theyve become closer. Thea is the only true family he has left and Malcolm pretty much damaged her. Losing Thea would put Oliver in a place where hed not just blame himself but Malcolm too probably moreso. That would break him knowing that he sided with Malcolm on more than one occasion knowing that Malcolm is the reason why Thea is the way she is despite Olivers best efforts to protect her. Plus Im a fan of Oliver and Thea is the only person hed go to war for to protect. Ive always appreciated their dynamic and losing her would impact him massively. Laurels death would have the least amount of impact in the grand scheme of things. I would be mad if they went down that route but for the storyline I cant see what more they could do with her death. I dont think its her because . they havent finished her BC story and . shes been written out of his life to such a point that killing her wouldnt have as big of an emotional impact as Diggle or Thea. ,arrow,czq5oa7,3,t5_2u4js

I think its sad that there has been a strong push for more female characters and making them out to more than a trope and while Thea is a good character Felicity was a great character they really make BC out to be a space filler than her realistically being a second main character second only to Oliver.,arrow,czuw87y,16,t5_2u4js

If Diggle dies the OTA fans will riot because theyll feel that one their cherished original members was sacrificed because the producers didnt have the guts to get rid of Laurel who they consider dead weight to the show.TBH this whole whos in the grave plot gimmick leaves a bad taste in my mouth because it feels like the writers are just exacerberating the fandom wars and pitting the Laurel fans and the FelicityOTA fans against each other.,arrow,d0b8ucm,5,t5_2u4js

Wasting the amazing opportunity of Demon Dean the insanely annoying and whiny Rowena the terrible death of Charlie wasting the Frankenstein family murdering Death retroactively ruining the character of Lucifer by saying he was somehow soiled by the Darkness and having another season about the brothers lying to each other to protect each other as the central character drama for like the sixth season in a row?

6794215,0,t3_48tm0t,Welcome Ben! Admittedly the site can be a bit...unhinged at times but is usually a bearer of good content and ideas. Some examples all in the past week or two The site adores the writing on seasons one and two and is both hopeful and faithful that there will be something of a restoration. Mainly we want more focused and longer fight scenes and for Oliver to actually fire more arrows more focus on the main villains and everything to do with the villains  and on the subject of villains having more weekly villains isnt a bad thing and it prevents the main villain from becoming a bit stale and on that note rather than weekly villains popping up as bank robbers I personally would prefer it to be more focused like the season  list less hacking Oliver should be able to find stuff out on his own as the Arrow rather than standing by while Felicity hacks her way out of the problem a bit less drama more training scenes flashbacks more connected to the present and season one Oliver some more Laurel stuff but if it is her in the grave it is something we can move on from maybe she could even come back at one point! and a more centered focus on Oliver both as the Green Arrow and as the person the mayor or CEO or partier or whatever. Yes we do attack Felicity but  that it isnt entirely without cause  the cliffhangers this year have both been about FelicityOlicity in years past theyve been about Oliver or the villain which is more proper for the show. Sure Olicity is part of the plot we accept that though an overwhelming majority is Lauriver but it doesnt have to be the central part...Thousands tens of thousands even of people on here alone feel this way. There are tons and tons more outside of this midsized community.

That Oliver really is trying to change and be a better person for Felicity.,arrow,d0msnsu,35,t5_2u4js
6800610,0,t3_48t7xg,This... isnt the comics though. Oliver Queen and Laurel Lance are pale shadows of the Green Arrow and Black Canary that have existed for decades. Green Arrow and Black Canary has a very different connotation in my head than Lauriver. Green Arrow and Black Canary is happy. Lauriver is lightyears away from ever being happy.The relationship on the show will never be the same one in the comics considering Oliver and Laurels past with each other and how much theyve gone through. To imply that two characters who are nothing like their inspirations one of which is treated horribly in the shows writing could ever reach the level of their relationship in the comics is a bit of a smack in the face to the comics and to the writers of Arrow for expecting them to deliver something that merely imitates the source especially after this many seasons.Could you seriously tell me that you would accept Oliver calling Laurel pretty bird any time soon? Oliver doesnt even use nicknames for anyone except Thea. It would sound horribly inorganic. It wouldnt really be Green ArrowBlack Canary.,arrow,d0n54n1,3,t5_2u4js

6804826,0,t3_48vnni,I think the same way! Ras shouldve never been shown. Have him be a mysterious character. Someone that most people even doubt that really exists. Saras shouldve never met him. Only his second in command daughters a few loyal fighters and a few business partners shouldve ever seen him. That couldve set up an infiltration arc just like on Young Justice when Aqua lad went into Black Mantas group. Have it seem like Oliver and Sara had a falling out. Let Sara rejoin the league and have her try to get close to Ras during the whole season. That couldve provided an intense and suspensefull arc for Sara. Learning more about her state of mind the hard decisions she has to make within the league and how it reflects on her loved ones.Have Ras really be this incredible scary character that would make Sara and Oliver totally shit their pants. The whole team should really think that Sara turned against them while Oliver knows what shes up to.But dont have Ras as the main villain. Let the focus be on someone else. And dont do dumb Hong Kong flashbacks. Have Oliver stay on the island. Let his bread grow bigger and his hair longer. Have him meet all kinds of DC characters on that island. Make that island something that attracks interesting and dangerous people. But dont focus too much on the flashbacks. Only do flashbacks when theres a story to tell. You dont need flashbacks every episodes. By skipping more flashbacks there will be more time to develop characters like Laurel a bit better. Dont have her become BC in this season. Let her find out about Oliver let her help the team but as her function as the DA. Hint here and there that Oliver gives her special self defense training. And let Olicity slowly die away. Let Felicity and Oliver find out that they arent suited for each other. That Oliver has demons that Felicity cant handle Laurel will be able to handle it a few seasons later. And have a villain that challenges Oliver on an intellectual level. ,arrow,d0nmdrz,2,t5_2u4js

6810413,0,t1_d0ngctp,They absolutely can change. I may even be willing to be friends with them again. But a guy sleeping with his girlfriends sister is pretty much the lowest of lows. A guy going back and sleeping with that same sister regardless of whether or not he was actively involved in another relationship isnt doing him any favors. If laurel was a priority for him he wouldnt be sleeping with her sister. He didnt leave sara. Sara left him. Thats not him choosing any differently. Oliver can change but laurel would be a fool to go back to him. Take out the Black CanaryArrow angle and think if you would want your sister or friend going back to a guy that had behaved that way. I would love to see Black CanaryArrow but the writers painted themselves into a corner on this one. Also being together is about more then sex. You cant gloss over how he historically treats her because they werent together.  Oliver often talks down to Laurel.

7021790,0,t3_4btgke,Guggenheim used to answer a lot of questions through his tumblr amp sometimes hed acknowledge the criticisms. Same thing with Amell  periodically hell respond to a negative comment. Their response is almost always Im sorry the show is not to your liking amp you dont have to keep watching amp believe it or not we are not influenced by any online fanbase.Most discussion about Olicity and its affect on the show is acknowledging people who like it or promoting it a a popular part of their brand in interviews amp through social media. Which in their defense they have to do. At the very least this is the direction they are going the rest of the season. And its reasonable to assume that even worst case scenario it is extremely unlikely that there will be enough of a change in viewership to make then reverse course for at least another season.There has been th briefest of acknowledgment following the consensus that season  sucked. Guggenheim has acknowledged budget problems affecting action saying Felicity cried too much as a point of character evolution amp the poor amp rushed plotting at at the end of last year was due to him doing twist heavy storytelling. So saying yeah maybe this or that didnt work but coming up with excusesquasiblaming the audience. Rickards to her credit all but admitted shes not qualified for dramatic scenes. Its my opinion that they clearly realized there was a problem and tried to correct it when this season started. Every character was given something to do they started with flashier stunts amp more colorful villains and most importantly downplayed any drama regarding Oliver amp Felicity. They even trotted out an incredibly cynical grave stunt to bring weight back to the show. So the first bunch of the season up until about Lost Souls was reasonably under control.

The writers then have said wife tell Karin its not her fault lol. Then she takes his car and now his office. In season  she is thinking of strategies before the two genius lawyers who went to school for it and then her journalism is being compared to the legendary Ben Urich. Her basically playing two characters resulted in WAY too much Karin in season . Around episode  I started to cringe every time she was on screen.,arrow,d1d3zqu,1,t5_2u4js

7073453,0,t3_4cevlt,I agree! The show has  fighter that could be developed uniquely and if yo watch some of the BTS for the fights you can see that the choreographers get it. For example they call Laurel concussion princess.More over you dont need to have them all fighting at the same time. A group shot? amazing! but when they are happening almost every episode it dilutes it.bench some characters some fights heck just have them even watch the door. Or do stealth work elswhere. But with everyone in the fray they all start to look samey.For example someone hast to fight their way to point B fast. Have Thea hit run and avoid as she sprints.Digg is a tank have him hold of people while other move. Have Laurel show her brawler nature taking people in close combat.And for Oliver please stop making him just whack people he is an archer! make use of the distance its al about the space.,arrow,d1i50uf,2,t5_2u4js

Fiasco I think they would be okay still at least not good but not terrible either. Im also currently rewatching Season  and god I really miss competent Oliver and China White as a villain.

Rotating Ras Dahrk and friends basically another Ras constant romance drama between Oliver and Felicity because having a normal healthy relationship doesnt fill time. If any of those subtle hints werent enough the entire flashback plot is just pure bullshit at this point literally the only good thing to ever come out of flashbacks this season was introducing Constantine which doesnt even require the island.

7179188,0,t1_d1u6oda,I dont like the terminology either nor do I really like shipping most of the time. But thats how the writers think were never going to be free of relationship drama on this show and thats the term they themselves have used for GAxBC. And Lauriver is a far more reasonable relationship than Olicity theres the obvious tried and true comic canon angle theres the fact that there is chemistry and shared life experience there but they also complement one another rather than parallel one another as an organic relationship really should be not the extreme logical conclusion of opposites attract that Olicity is Laurels a far more reasonable character than Felicity and Katies a far better actor than Emily and if Lauriver was the central relationship the show would legitimately go back to being a superhero show because Laurel would be out there fighting alongside Oliver for much of their scenes rather than Felicitys pushing Oliver back into the vigilante life and then whining about him having to lie or make tough calls as a result of said vigilante life.As much as I really disapprove of shipping because half the time its completely unreasonable forcing two characters together who dont belong together as with Olicity Id say I do ship Lauriver because thats the rational endgame for the shows romance which will never not be part of the show. And Ill continue using that term because thats what the writers themselves use. The terminology isnt the problem with shipping thats just shorthand.,arrow,d1u7jc5,8,t5_2u4js

They found that the movie was trying to explain too much without allowing casuals to catch up. They felt the action was good but the plot was rushed. They said they prefer the Marvel movies because it was well set up dumbed and slowed down in order to attract the casual viewer. One of them explicitly said that you could leave out watching one of the Marvel movies he didnt watch Thor and still comprehend what The Avengers was about. He appreciated that aspect of the MCU.

7203965,0,t3_4e1114,Both DC and Marvel have a tendency to dip in overall quality but they usually recover. Marvel just has more competent people working for them right now which where alot of their success is coming from. Some people may disagree with that but Im just gonna call it like I see it.DCs hasnt been doing so hot since . The New  and Green Lantern are to blame really. Not to say The New  sucks Scott Snyders run on Batman was in my opinion amazing. But it was so joyless and boring otherwise I cant forgive what they did to Blue Beetle that was a trainwreck. And theres been ups. I liked Man of Steel and Flashpoint Paradox and obviously Seasons  and  of Arrow and Flash are baller af. Constantine was very enjoyable.Im not sure what the common consensus for BvS is right now. But I personally found it to be one of the worst movies Ive seen in a good long while and I was crazy disappointed by it. Both as a representation of the DC Trinity Ben Affleck was fantastic but the bad script was holding him back. Would love to see a Solo Batman film with him though long as Zack Snyder stays far away from it and as a movie in general It felt so over produced and choppy I couldnt get any connection for anything going on or any of the characters. I dunno maybe the R rated cut will fix that. But I felt the same way with Sucker Punch and Watchmen so this might be a problem I have with Zack Synders direction. So that might mean DCll learn its lesson given the drop off BvS is having at the box offics and go in a better direction for Justice League. I can only hope right? Im optimistic about Suicide Squad though. Looks good.DCll get back on its feet. It recovered from Batman and Robin after all. We got another rebranding for the comics coming up in a few months and from what Geoff Johns has said Im actually optimistic about it. DC Rebirth might not suck.A change in direction for the company is what I think it needs. Then itll send ripples into its other products. Including Arrow. And the Comics are usually the best place to start. Being the origin of the company.gtAt least we have the greatest superhero movie of alltime.Yeah but Mask of the Phantasm is an exceedingly tough act to follow.  years later and that old girl is still absolutely fantastic.,arrow,d1x17m6,2,t5_2u4js

I was mostly talking about the tweens on tumbler. I think people who have their brain fully developed can spot a good show or a bad one and probably arent in the mindset that a comic book based show isnt about soap opera love story mechanics like they have been doing with arrow.  Its just hard for me to see the other perspective on this show which is the people who never read the source stuff because Ive read everything and am I huge fan of both DC and Marvel and even Spawn still so I just cant see both sides I guess. I didnt mean to say everyone new to the show doesnt get it and is wrecking it its mostly a specific group and then the writers themselves for acknowledging that kind of mentality instead of sticking to the source that got them the job to begin with and trying to enhance it in new ways but still ways that always feel authentic to the fans. I think Flash mostly does a good job at that. Nothing is perfect though and I dont expect it to be. What they are doing on Arrow is a nightmare though.

I certainly feel that its a lot more believable that someone of Amell body size is beating the shit out of people than Willa note I dont mean firing arrows and being competent with bows  because the shows hardly does that anymore. It kinda makes more sense with a little bit of training but weve still definitely seen a lot of female fighters on Team Arrow itself especially as the series has progressed.Sara Laurel and Thea. That about balances out Olly Roy and Diggle. I mean you could argue that someone like Ray also counts but Id say that hes had the smallest role participating in the actual team of all the above characters.Personally I think Arrow does a pretty decent job of representing women. It was initially a dark show and thats why some deaths were gruesome  if Moiras death had been anything less that feeling of absolute despair that was so visible on Olivers face during and after that confrontation wouldnt have been anywhere near as good. Waller and Laurel dying so quickly and without putting up a fight more or less arose from a need to write them out of the plot. I still think theres something fishy about Waller bowing out as soon as her character rocks up in the DCEU. The thing I never understand about these criticisms of the deaths of women or maybe some minority group in a particular show is that if its meant to be going for a realistic vibe a villain is never going to let someone some live because theyre a woman who just so happens to be defenseless at that moment.Its not like men have particularly kind deaths as much weight as that term carries in this show nowadays anyway either. Tommy was crushed by a collapsing building Oliver stabbed an arrow though his own chest just to get to at Malcolms heart Robert literally shot himself in the head and Olly fell off a cliff or something before the whole penicillin tea thing happened. OP also mentioned Felicitys spinal injury which like almost everything bad in the last two seasons was temporary but Darkh shooting up Olivers limo was the most Arrow moment weve had the entire season  this is a show where Oliver brutally fucked up Slade Wilsons right eye with an arrow.Its not about whether the men outdo the women in terms of getting the short end of the stick or viceversa. Arrow simply isnt a good show to choose if youre trying to make a point about how one group gets killed off because it is  or at least is supposed to be  a really violent show. ,arrow,d23y16z,3,t5_2u4js

7294658,0,t3_4f6t34,Hi Im here on behalf of the of the Olicity fandom. Yes we have bad eggs amongst us. Yes some people bully Katie. Yes some people ship SA and EBR in real life and hate on his wife. You know what though?. An OLICITY FAN made a fan account for Cassandra on tumblr and instagram. cassandraamell.tumblr.comAn account that is followed by a lot of other Olicity fans including myself. I and so many others love his family and LaurelKatie. So I dont understand this expose the Olicity fandom agenda at all. I follow the people whose tweets you linked above and they MOSTLY dont tag CJ or Katie or whoever they are hating. Does that make it okay?. No but it means that the celebrities dont have to see this hate and can go on living their lives in peace. Many LL and antiOlicity accounts however are posting receipts and tagging the cast and crew. One account in particular Notsuperfriends in constantly tagging Stephen his wife and Emily and their friends in cheating allegations. They cant say anything because it would only bring attention to the matter and make it worse so they have to ignore this harassment. Id appreciate it if you could all report that account btw. Weve been trying but no luck so far. Screenshots are being posted all around by the Olicity and Lauriver fandom and its a mess. I nearly gave up social media because of the negativity. I dont know what you are trying to achieve by doing all this. Laurel wont come back and Olicity wont end because theyve made it integral to the story. Someone posted some CJ hate    to Stephen and it did nothing but probably ruin the guys mood. The fact that he and Emily seem reluctant to take pics together is probably also because of this which makes me very sad because a lot of us just want to see that the people who play our ship are friends in real life too. We enjoy all the pictures of the cast together because its nice when they are close IRL. Like KatieEmily and EmilyColton.Please stop this hateful campaign to tag the EPs and cast with receipts. You are ruining things for them and all the nice people in the Olicity and the Lauriver fandom. If you dont like Arrow anymore please take a break from watching but dont harass the cast and crew anymore. And leave our fandom alone. Everytime you post this stuff on twitter to the EPs we have to pull out our receipts    we have plenty. In the end it achieves nothing but show what everyone already knows. Every fandom has its crazies. Stop this fighting. Lets enjoy the show in peace. Also if the aim of this is to stop these people from their delusions and hate then Im sorry to tell you it wont work. These people are too lost in their hate to care. Anyway I hope you read all this and I hope you delete this thread or at least quit your olicity fandom is hitler agenda.,arrow,d27cq37,-5,t5_2u4js

7396574,0,t3_4giigj,I dont agree with a lot of the points in this article. The flashbacks would be better if the writing was better getting rid of them is treating a symptom not the cause. The quality of the writing is worse overall Felicity is the focal point in the present so all the bad writing revolves around her but since the flashbacks dont have that focal point theyre aimless forgettable garbage. As for writing the plot for every season before shooting begins a lot of shows have made up the plot as they went along Lost Breaking Bad etc and admitted it after but the writing was phenomenal no one whos seen Breaking Bad would think it was made up episode by episode. Its actually pretty common in TV writing so this is just another example of the showrunners being bad at their job and I doubt if they sat down and plotted out the season before it started wed get anything much better. And for his point on villains I actually like the Arrowverse and Smallville before it approach of modernizing minor villains. Why come up with something completely new when you can draw from the canon and incorporate a part of comic book lore into your story? The two examples he used Lady Cop and Demolition Team were honestly two of my favorite parts of this season which just says a lot about this season despite not knowing they were comic book inspired although I assumed at first. But I agree they need longer arcs instead of only getting one episode that way you dont need as many of them. And saying get rid of all the archers is like telling The Flash to get rid of all the speedsters. Its a longstanding comic book trope that if a hero has a gimmick at least a few of his villains will have the same or similar gimmick. Agree with the other points Dial Felicity down darker tone respect the Black Canary better fight scenes.,arrow,d2ixx69,2,t5_2u4js

You dont know how big ARGUS is either. Second Team Arrow has this thing called plot armor. If this was Game of thrones every single one of them would be dead. The fact that you think that a truck is harder to break in than a building speaks for itself. They could have you know used any other vehicle. Or at least not in the same city that HIVE is in even thought as you think they are everywhere. What contingency plan? The truck had none. Also Darhk went first for the Sara which makes no sense why would he do that? And even killing Lyla makes no sense but even if he wanted to do that he could have just literally snaped her neck and took the chip from the dead body. Im not a woman. Well I guess im the first one. Im not arguing about the facts and stuff but until you literally arent a spy or train spys in CIA or an inteligence agency im pretty sure you dont know that much about it. And well if we are using arguments from outer world im a screenwriting student and trust me I wouldnt write it much better but I can spot that its pretty bad writing.

That in mind you come here for genuine in depth conversation but I dont particularly care for that given the current status of the show. Youve been pointed to a sub rcwarrow which was made for people like you. However you complain that theres not that many people in it. Have you considered that might be because those along your line of want are in the minority? Your desires arent unreasonable by any stretch of the imagination theyre completely fair and I can relate given how much people shat on Gotham in its initial start but theyre not in my observation what most people in this sub want. They want shitposts nostalgic circle jerks about once was and angry rants at what is now. This is the tyranny of the majority that what some people want is super ceded by what most desire. You have two options. Unsubscribe move to rcwarrow where likeminded individuals are and get the genuine discussion you want at the cost of being in a tiny sub or grow to embrace the desires of the community. Or you can keep complaining in the hopes of changing it but thats as likely as is complaining will change the actual show.,arrow,d2wla78,10,t5_2u4js

Laurel and Oliver was always the way it was supposed to be it would have worked out way better for the show in the long run. I always imagined LO as the main love drama even from the first few episodes. It just doesnt make sense lol. Everyone is saying that the writers are trying to kill the show or Marc G is full of shit and sucks but why would they try to get themselves fired or out of a job? That sounds straight crazy lol. What the hell is going on here with this network and this show cause Flash is still good but not as good as it used to be either in my opinion. We have seen like  fucking Jay Garricks and no one has ever tried to explain that or make sense of it. Is it really the writers or is it maybe the Network executives wanting more CW fuckery who the hell knows.

So its about AdMarketer money not fanbase. I heard theories that maybe ArrowSPN has more ads per hour than Flash does???.  If the above pie chart is correct then CW is really wasting Flash money making potentional.

It is deceiving fans and its illegally to do so.Youre being ridiculous.The thing was announced and available for preorder well before Laurel became Black Canary or they even released a photo of Katie in the costume. Anyone with two brain cells to rub together should have realized who the Pop figure was supposed to be then especially when it was announced and its usually sold alongside the RetroAction figure that has a photo of Sara on the packaging.And since Laurel became Black Canary its obvious the Sara Pop is not meant to be Laurel since their costumes are totally different and I would expect a Laurel fan who cares enough about this to get angry about the labeling on a fucking box to also care enough to know the difference.But sure its totally illegal. I hope someone sues them.I also hope someone sues Andrew Kreisberg for giving Caity Lotz a Black Canary action figure and telling her that that was who shed be playing when she got hired.Im personally about to wage a lawsuit against DC for selling a twopack with Billy Wintergreen and Oliver that has Billy Wintergreen labeled as Deathstroke even though I saw clearly that it was Billy Wintergreen and not Slade Wilson being represented by the action figure.,arrow,d3ncf32,5,t5_2u4js

7758628,0,t1_d3o2fd8,Ive actually gone through the credits of each episode this season and its for real. Which means sadly that we have a much bigger problem than just Guggenheim. Hes been the most obnoxious about it but a lot of the creative decisions we dont like directly involve Berlanti and Kriesberg. Which makes me wonder why theyve switched direction so hard and how much external influence from the CW DC and WBs films division theres been.I agree with you hes a face to a problem. But theres probably a case for bringing our complaints directly to Berlanti and Kriesberg and maybe Geoff Johns. If Guggenheim genuinely has as little control as Arrows own credits seem to suggest he cant fix the problems and having him fired wont fix the problems either.,arrow,d3o3hjj,1,t5_2u4js

7791395,0,t3_4lze6o,Unlike A lot of people I liked the new  As someone fairly new to comics been reading for just over  years It was very helpful. It made getting to know new characters very easy. Arrow the tv show got me into comics in a big way and my favorite character has always been Green Arrow and while the jeff lemire did a amazing story arc with him I am excited to see the Emerald Archer back as a more classic version of himself. The issue itself was amazing The Cover was beautiful and the art in the book was equally so. It felt like stills from a DCAU film and it was Great. Oliver being the Classic fighting for the man version of himself was also great and his interactions with the Black Canary were amazing. I like the idea of a court of owls esc group in seattle and am very excited to see where it goes from here. I have nothing negative to say about this issue,arrow,d3rt647,7,t5_2u4js

Id be ok with them changing the story over the long run. Like if they said in season  that Diggle was going to be a short time character but then he is becoming a series regular thats fine its over a longer time period where they change their mind because of new information. It means that they are actually learning and adapting. What they did was say one thing and the IMMEDIATELY went against it. Its a difference between lying and adapting. They promised that this season was going to be better than season  its adapting. This season ended with adapting to a wrong format and sticking with it.They literally had a whole speech from Mama Smoak to Detective Lance saying that lying is bad and that people shouldnt do it. This show flipflops on so many different things Felicity telling her mother that it was ok to keep a secret sometimes if it meant keeping others safedont remember what Lance lied to her about anymore and then the following episode she is astounded that Oliver was keeping a secret william. Granted they are two different scales. After them lying about all the stuff that I have already mentioned they proceed with calling out characters that arent the Smoak family for lying. Thats hypocritical. Im not saying that it would be hypocritical for writers to call the police instead of vigilantes if there was a gunman. Im saying that they are making it seem like lying is a bigger deal than it is in not just our world but also on the show and proceed to lie about said show. ,arrow,d418chi,1,t5_2u4js

It really made sense  she wasnt some wunderhacker she was just a person who knew enough about computers to be helpful occasionally. Like when he brings her one of Merlins arrows and asks if she can help him figure out where it was made. That took her a while and she never gave him anything conclusive like ITS FROM MALCOM MERLIN I DID IT! just clues that he used to piece things together. That was cool and made sense. She was contributing and helping solve a seasonlong mystery instead of just snapping her fingers and saying here you go I hacked it. In season  they savagely retconned her character with that stupid college scene where shes all edgy and hardcore. Suddenly shed been an amazing hacker her whole life hur derp. Which makes it kind of weird that in season  she wasnt just knocking this stuff out of the park but I feel like the writers ignore everything that happened in season  entirely. ,arrow,d49bglz,67,t5_2u4js

7950801,0,t1_d49me2o,Yeah the analogy is pretty stretchy for the original trilogy but season  to Phantom Menace works decently. Its a reboot of sorts in that Arrow is coming back as Green Arrow and trying to have a different tone. Theres a new shadowy threat and a sinister magicForce user who has great potential but is utterly wasted. Similar to Phantom Menace focusing too much on CGI and demystifying the Force this season focused too much on a relationship. Near the end a major character is killed and if written well going forward it could be a major motivator for the other main character ObiWanOliver  Spoiler That doesnt happen. Finally theres also a main character that only people with childlike intelligence could love. ,arrow,d49quhu,1,t5_2u4js

They were laying the tracks for that much more than they were bothering with a coherent plot. Even then its never felt natural and theres never been romantic chemistry between Felicity and Oliver. Just flirting which the Olicity fangirls think of as true romance because their idea of a relationship is based on things like soap operas trash romance novels and Twilight.This is a show where the writers used Ras AlGhul and Laurel Lance to ship Oliver and Felicity.,arrow,d4im1xp,7,t5_2u4js

Fucked up shit happens to everyone in the DC Universe thats whats so great about the DC Universe. Ray Palmer lost two fiances almost lost his life and has been through a lot yet hes still a fun character. Hal Jordan and the Flash always find a way to be the comedic relief in the team but every iteration of their character has loved and lost hell every iteration of the Flash has died and theyre still very funny. Oliver Queen the comic character has loved and lost a lot. Got divorced from Dinah watched Dinah die once or twice lost his best friend Hal died fighting his best friend Hal lost all his assets to Komodo lost his sidekick Roy once or twice got drugged and raped by Shado sounds a little worse in context TBF and in most iterations he lost both his parents at a young age in a hunting accident. Through all thios he still became the comedy relief we know him as.

You possess true courage.. I am truly sorry.... You did not pass that on to your son. Was incredible. I remember feeling the confusion they must have felt after that limo got hit and they woke up on the ground to find themselves in that situation. It was abrupt and it was perfect. And most importantly it did serve a purpose. Then watching Laurel die its embarrassing. Katies a good actress but so much of that episode was undignified. That stabbing scene and her facial reaction having to convulse on that hospital bed laying there playing dead. It had none of the cinematic feel that Moiras did.

8308054,0,t1_d5g1w04,Find me an executive who doesnt realize that the showrunners and writers changed after the strongest  seasons and the show has been seen to go downhill ever since. Executives arent stupid. They know that no matter how strong an actor they cant carry a complete shit product on their own if theyre given nothing to work with. At this point its quite literally  as far as the show goes. However if youre an exec you also have to take into consideration his other work social media presence and general marketability. As far as social media and marketability goes Stephen has that in spades. I havent seen anyone online do anything but sing his praises. An exec doesnt want to hire an asshole who will literally turn people off to the show because they dont like the actor. Referencing directly to the show executives can literally see the decline based on management changes. Your point is that hes in trouble because of the show. My point is executives arent stupid and as of now the majority is in favor of him finding more work after Arrow is over easily.

Starling City is a big city they could have split the team and make them fight crime at different parts of city and make them join up for big things. Oliver is more than capable of taking care of himself and others can cover for each other after all.Or they could have had real lives not all of them had to be on the street all the time. Do Batman always go on patrol with Robin? No. Give a night off to Laurel get her prepped for an upcoming case. Have Diggle spend a night with his family out eating dinner. Make Thea date someone cool have some fun. Hell if they had to subject us to Donna Smoak they couldve at least turn her into a human being with a discernible character instead of sum total of blonde dye cleavage mini skirts and cliches like blondes are stupid and daughter wants to distance from mom by giving her some time with Felicity alone having some interaction that is not forced drama.

8491583,0,t1_d62i3er,Yeah Arrow just needs a good long term planner. In Season  they had no clue where they were going with the plot. I was rooting for Oliver to become Ras Al Ghul because I didnt know that it was a bad thing until they made up the brainwashing and the destroying of the city several episodes later and for some bizarre coincidence it involves the alphaomega virus. The way they built Ras up to that point this is completely out of character for him. The writers pulled something out of their ass at the last second.The writers admitted that they didnt know who was going to be in the grave at the beginning of Season  probably the strongest evidence that they dont plan ahead at all. And once again they make stuff up at the very end of the season. Suddenly there is this Rubicon device that allows Damien Darhk to nuke the world and his motivation to do so comes out of nowhere. He didnt even care that it would kill his daughter! How does any of this relate to the gmo corn teaser in the middle of the season?Meanwhile on The Flash its obvious where the writers wanted to go. Wellsobard was teased all season in Season . Small hints dropped all over the place until the big reveal. In Season  stuff like The Man In The Iron Mask was obviously planned from the beginning. They have the final scenes in mind before they started filming.If there is no end target its very hard for an individual writer to move the story. Nobody wants to step on someone elses toes so they are going to write conservatively i.e. nothing happens for the first  of the season then the bad guy suddenly reveals his end of the world plot. They are not going to commit a character to something until they hit that point where they are like oh shit we gotta put someone in the grave and it is done sloppily i.e. we dont have time to choreograph a final fight scene for her so lets just make her die on the hospital bed. A character like Thea is just a plot device to be manipulated by evil men so Oliver has to go save her because they have no goal for her despite her getting a lot of character setup in Season  why do so much with her and not give her plot in the future?.,arrow,d62zvpm,2,t5_2u4js

Pfft forget things like an internet connection thats not necessary.Theres one other fictional character that Felicity reminds me of. Complete lack of social capability that leads to always acting inappropriately? Starts off somewhat amusing but quickly gets old and ends up just an asshole? Sounds like Sheldon Cooper to me.Sorry did I say one? I meant every goddamn hacker in a television ensemble whos awkward and has no clue how actual computers work who serves as a plot device and product placement personification? Original character? Yeah right.So what is your stance on lying anyway? Sounds to me like you and your mother who embodies all of your many worst traits are the only ones allowed to lie. Which begs the question what are you doing on a superhero team where lying is a natural way of life? There are more holes in your logic than in that dreadful coat.Of course thats not the only reason you dont belong on the team. Theres also the fact that you dont care for anyone but yourself. Sorry thats unfair. You did once show care for one other person. Over the lives of an entire city! I guess now you finally got to fulfill your wish to kill a whole population.But who could hate you when you do such adorable things as hand someone an envelope then yell at them not to open it?

People who have cooked with it compare it to butter or bacon i.e. secret of making anything great is putting in lots of butter or bacon. Its mostly unsaturated fat too unlike butter and bacon so it is nutritionally pretty close to olive oil. However it has a high smoking temperature so you can use it for more dishes.Ducks can be pretty fatty so it could be hard to eat all that duck fat that drips out. When I eat duck I always remove and save some of that duck fat for other dishes. Glaze it on your other meats. Rub it over your potatoes. Or my favorite is to use it in baked goods and pastries.

8925886,0,t1_d7kr9kg,Someone please replace Guggie with this guy.

8926034,0,t3_52g3g5,yes I also thought that it would have been so much better if they gave a final fight between Darhk against GA and Laurel. He still does not have the powers and GA and BC are winning over him but in the heat of the fight he kills some prisoners and becomes more powerful and pushes GA away take one of his arrows and stabs Laurel in surprise. And I also think that how they treated Nyssa and the league was awful. Why Nyssa couldnt kill Malcolm herself is beyond me why Malcolms character should be made every time more important and stepping over everybody else so he has a story the others should be weak manipulated or die so he stays on the show.,arrow,d7ks0u6,3,t5_2u4js
8926079,0,t1_d7krdut,It could have worked I agree especially on the whole Laurels story was over bullshit argument Felicitys story was really over. She went from IT department to running the company was engaged to the man of her dreams was moonlighting as a vigilante saving the city.But heres the issue we cant have it both ways Laurels death cant be bullshit and fridging when killing Felicity in that manner would have been an even worse example. Instead I would rather they played up the paralysis more she shouldnt have walked again until mid season . In the scenario I laid out before you still need to give Felicity story she is still part of the cast but if her story is one of bitterness and resentmentsorry you dont have a magic chat with your old goth self and get over being paralyzed in  minutes and slowly driving a wedge between her and Oliver and it being her decent towards darkness again the theme of dark vs light is cool if you explore it in various ways Felicity was a light hearted character giving her this edge to where she looses some of that and she still gets fired from Palmer tech she leaves the team only returning after Quintens death trying to help Laurel track Darkh down since she sees Laurels need for revenge something she feels as well Darkh took away her legs and also hurt her mother when Quinten died. You can have Laurel after not killing Darkh tell Felicity that revenge cant be there path there is too much darkness in their circle. Oliver Sara Thea Diggle they have all taken lives for various reasons they all have their demons. Laurel and Felicity need to be the light for their friends its a burden and it wont be easy but if they really want to help the people of Star City they need to be the ones who stand in the light to bring their friends out of the dark. making Felciity important isnt a bad thing if done right.The problem with Felicity isnt just that shes poorly written and a mary sue its that everything in her life revolves around a man she doesnt earn anything on her own merits. Shes in a relationship with Ray and he loves her because shes so amazing he leaves her the company. She gets Oliver and he gives up his quest to save his city for her. She gets paralyzed and her gay best friend creates a chip so she can walk again. She leaves Oliver cause lying.On the other hand having Felicity leave Star City at the end of season  because she wants to find a way to walk again not because she cant live with her situation if she has to but because its about not letting Darkh win. She comes back to Star City set to prove she deserves to work at Palmer Technot run it that is so fucking stupid that she has skills that will help make the company better and then her end goal is to one day be the one ruining the company.There was a way to use Felicity and give her screen time and make her important that resulted in an actual strong independent woman and would have probably resulted in less hate for the character. Instead what we got was herp a derp Felicity is teh best thing EVER all bow to her Laurel dies but she is happy that she is dying because now Oliver can be with Felicity. Like the back half of season  is fucking Felicity fan fiction and it makes me so sad. Im by no means a writer but I see all the elements of a great story in season  it was all there its just they chose the path of shitty fan fiction instead of doing their jobs and crafting a good story.,arrow,d7ks7tk,0,t5_2u4js

8951234,0,t1_d7nkrcq,Like a lot of things being rational doesnt necessarily means you are right. People are partially logical and partially emotional there are times when being  rational is wrong for example telling your dying parents you are not sad at all because everone dies and they are not different or telling your girlfriendwife she is not special because you are only attached to her because of biological reasons. Of course those are extreme examples but my point is things you could do and says doesnt equate what you should say or do under many circumstances for example you could quit college and drink all day long but you shouldnt. Its the same thing with internet being an asshole is being an asshole rational or not doesnt change that. So yes they have the right to attack others online but others also has the right to retalite because it pisses them off. I hate it when someone drop the i have an opinion so im not wrong bomb because others have the right to disagree with certain opinions. Some times people pull the opinion card as a way to silence others and end the conversation other than to start one which is simply bullshit and on this sub there used to be a lot of bitching because some people feel like we are somehow silencing them but the reality is they are the entitled ones who thought we are obligated to like and agree with their opinions and when we retaliate against opinions we do not like  they victimized themselves. ,arrow,d7nszq3,1,t5_2u4js

8976427,0,t3_537d8m,This is tough for me. On one hand Green Arrow is one of my favorite superheroes and I would love to see his show be great again. I would love to see the good old team back together Red Arrow Green Arrow and Black Canary. I want to see them go up against the REAL Count Vertigo I want to see them fight against Drakon I want to see Tommy Merlyn return as the Dark Archer. I want to see Green Arrow done right. It didnt matter much to me that he wasnt blonde but I did want him to be funnier. Nevertheless I still loved Arrow seasons amp. If Arrow has stayed on the same track we couldve gotten the Oliver from the comics sarcastic funny Oliver in later seasons. Unfortunately we got Felishitty. I know his show can be great and I really want to see Green Arrow Reborn.On the other hand though just put the show out of its misery. Ive seen how some of the cast members act in interviews and while its subtle you can tell they think the writing is shit. Maybe at this point it would be better to just cancel it and bring on a new show with a new show runner. Let Guggigag keep Legends of Tomorrow since its unlikely canceling the show would fire him unless he did something REALLY bad. Ive seen some people suggest some good replacements for Arrow like a Birds of Prey show starring Huntress Black Canary and others. I personally would love to see a live action Teen Titans. I know TNT cancelled their Titans project so there is likely an unfinished script floating around. I loved the idea of a live action Teen Titans show so much that I already wrote up a first draft of how season  would go.At this point I am unsure of what should happen to Arrow. Like I said on one hand I love Green Arrow and want to see him portrayed well. On the other hand maybe its broken beyond repair and we should just put the show out of its misery.TLDR I am split. I want Green Arrow to be awesome but I think another show like Teen Titans would do great as long as Guggigag isnt part of it.EDIT Adding in a TLDR,arrow,d7qtwmo,4,t5_2u4js

9012528,0,t1_d7v539h,Personally I found the first half to be very hit or miss in terms of quality. I can understand why people wouldnt like the fact that the episodes didnt connect a whole lot or was more of an introduction to the whole team but I never found myself really wanting to go back to watching a st half episode again even for just a particular scene. It also didnt really feel like anything was all that important. Finally there is also the fact that I think most people were expecting some crossovers like the Nick Fury stuff throughout I know I was really disappointed with the Thor tiein. I think watching the episodes in a small time period wont be too bad but there was also the weird circumstances that forced the show to have like a half dozen breaks throughout the first  episodes or so. All that is under the bridge for me now as the show is clearly a solid one in its own right. ,arrow,d7v5yr5,1,t5_2u4js

Thats completely irrelevant being an adaptation of a comic book gives you many liberties and being able to mess around with the origin story is one of them. Granted the way the Arrow writers are doing his origin story is the dumbest fucking thing Ive ever heard in my life Curtis gets slightly beat up then wants to become a vigiliante crimefighter it doesnt matter if its like the comics or not.

Remember how they followed up Saras angst about Laurels death with a joke about Firestorm ruining her boots? Just rename this show into Lulz of Tomorrow alreadygt In that way I really feel that Arrow distills every loss to how it motivates OliverI disagree a little bit. The problem is not that they make it about Oliver its the fact that they stopped being creative about this. Death used to be a lesson nowadays its just an excuse to go into sad mode and nothing more.gt And also theres the thing about how disingenuous it would feel for Oliver to have this fantasy after all the shit he pulled on Laurel and how the writers sidelined her. Her being sidelined is not really his fault and sudden revelations that act almost like retcons arent really something new for comics.Look I get it youre sick of Oliver but its not really a bad thing.,arrow,d9wwq1z,2,t5_2u4js

From the Next Gen episode The Chase gt After studying the ambiguous number blocks for hours the discovery is made that these fragments are compatible DNA strands which have been recovered from different worlds all over the galaxy. The crew eventually believe that they have discovered an embedded genetic pattern that is constant throughout many different species and it is speculated that this was left by an early race that predates all other known civilizations. This would ultimately explain why so many races are humanoid....gtThey locate the final DNA fragment which completes and runs the program. The program reconfigures the tricorders emitter to project a holographic message. The recorded image of an alien humanoid Salome Jens is projected to the assembled company and it explains that its race is responsible for the presence of life in the Alpha Quadrant. When the alien race first explored the Alpha and Beta Quadrants there had been no humanoidbased life other than themselves and so they seeded various planets with their DNA to create a legacy of their existence after they had gone.

I think the writers start out with a big moment the grave in season  to get people watching but really have nothing good written in mind when they do and they just shoe in some horseshit.  I read that the writers enjoy writing themselves into corners and trying to find a way out.  Unfortunately that means every now and then usually on this show you get a shit twist just for the sake of subverting expectations and avoiding the obvious and easy way out.  Anyone remember the clear opportunity to use the Lazarus Pit the smart thing to do even if everyone who knew the mythos had it figured out but instead he drank tea and had a will to survive.

9918349,0,t3_5hgkfy,The only ones on DCTV that could actually put some work on Superman is Supergirl or Savitar. Ultimately Superman wins against Supergirl though with his combat speed. Im not entirely sure just how fast Savitar is but if hes supposed to be multiple times faster than Barry who traveled around the world in a minute I think he could take Superman. I dont think MoS could tag Savitar.The most interesting one is GA vs Batman. Oliver could give Bruce a run for his money. But Oliver is VERY inconsistent. When you look at his best feats he stands a chance. We have seen insane non human feats from Oliver. Its really quite amazing how many batshit feats weve seen over the years. I mean a lot of these are probably inadvertent but its worth a mention.Olivers strength is crazy in the pilot he effortlessly snaps a neck which requires lbs of force. He knocked out a trio of triad men with one swing of his bow. His Arrows are supposed to be able to pierce steel yet they are knocked off Slades armor. This means Slades armor is stronger than steel but Oliver is able to make him hurt through the armor which is very superhuman. His durability is actually insane he survived a sword through his chest and being kicked off a cliff in a below freezing environment. He was pretty successful in taking down Barry and was able to grab Barrys super speed punch and tag him with his Mach level reaction times. He has really good awareness he was able to literally dodge Mr Blanks bullet in S because he heard his footsteps. Hes caught arrows and has shot arrows with crazy precision through a gun barrel. Hes beaten large amounts of people at once when saving Walter. And he does it very rapidly and decisively faster than the Bvs warehouse scene. Oliver is also mentioned to be stronger faster than Merlyn and Merlyn dented a metal wall. Overall Batman still takes it just for the fact that hes so much more consistent. I cant see DCEU Bruce struggling with Lady Cop.Team DCEU would absolutely sweep DCTV though. Theyve drawn a pretty clear line as to how weak some people are in the DCTV. ATOM is dumb and useless. Vixens powers is dumb and useless. All of Arrow vigilantes COMBINED Canaries Spartan Speedy amp Arsenal recruits could probably still lose to Oliver.

10101004,0,t3_5khjap,I think it is high time that they get on the redemption arc for Laurel that they were building for YEARS and this might be the way to do it. Considering that Katie has a contract that touches on every CW show except maybe Supergirl I can totally see her having an overarching effect on every show and if it is handled properly it could be really dynamic as opposed to the stuff they usually gave Katie to do in the past.Also I sincerely doubt that anyone is overly surprised but there is always something missing from a trailer so I am guessing that either the one in the trailer IS Laurel from E and gets redeemed eventually or as someone said the E Laurel is in hiding for now and then when she comes out and defeats Black Siren v that will cement her as Olivers equal and his true fighting partner. They seem to be taking the long approach now and I think that the LaurelOliver fans are not all that upset about it. I know that I am not.

I was still iffy on the show as a whole overly serious and a little wooden but her character sold me.

10288461,0,t1_dca80tk,Everything is possible on this show right now after season  plot holes with stupid decisions saving budget for vfx stuff but hiring a big stunt team. When that money can be used on CGI canary cry and CGI Arrows. Or just hire actor like Jon Foo if they want to make more fight scenes. Personally i like scenes where stunt double used for  seconds but not for long fight sequences.I think Zoic studios using Houdini and Nuke for their products. Just make scene with Sonic Wave inside Houdini then use Nuke to distort that wave in post production. AOS Daisy powers the same as canary cry. But Arrow production office doesnt care about that  like in season  scene Oliver shoots the arrow and arrow explodes. They just put D rendered explosion on D scene because they need to save budget and that was Donna Smoak scene ,arrow,dca948l,2,t5_2u4js

I gave it  as an average over the entire season  pre mid season finale  post mid season finale .I also know a lot of people are liking Season  so far but for me there is still some things fundamentally wrong with it. The first  episodes have been heavily reliant on action scenes to the detriment of character interactions.The action scenes are a welcome improvement but they seem to be now more important than actual plot. I dont like the way most of the main cast were almost completely sidelined. The new team members arent either interesting or effective as Vigilantes. There has been no sign of Oliver actually wanting to be mayor  when he really did want to be last season. I know a lot of people have enjoyed the season so far and I hope that by the end of the season Ill be able to score the season as whole much higher.,arrow,dcdlui4,1,t5_2u4js

10384492,0,t1_dcl3mj8,I feel like Thea was emotional about it but her season  story quickly gave way to substance abuse and boyfriend stuff. And I feel like Moira should have been more concerned with the specifics considering her POV. Anyway I think a lot of the familyfriends curiousity was front loaded into the first half of season one and then mostly dropped. I think Quentins back and forth with Oliver has been deeply inconsistent and frankly made him look like a dummy. There was no reason he couldnt have done some follow up afte that test  especially considering it raised more questions than answers! They should have done a Commisoner GordonBatman thing with Olivers secret ID where he knows but never acknowledges it until he had to in a bit moment. Though I guess they kinda already did that with Moira. But come on hes able to suss out Roy Harper in costume but not the guy hes known for decades spent most of that time highly critical of and had already suspected?Yeah I dont see how people wondering about Olivers time away wouldnt be interesting enough to get into sooner. I think it has a lot to do with the fact that theyve removed the relevance of the five years away from the present day storylines. Every time Olivers growth as a character is mentioned its always about how hes changed since season  in Starling. This is a big in about why the flashbacks have been so underwhelming the last two years. The show stopped being about callous dick playboy to superhero around season  and became about mean spirited murderous guy to superhero. But thats a whole other topic obv..,arrow,dcl5a6v,4,t5_2u4js

She was in love with the man she knew he was capable of being. So this stuff about craziness fake IDS and which would I choose? It doesnt fit the Lauriver relationship. The closest fit would be SaraOliver though I think even they evolved past that postisland. Even the Lauriver scenes in this video dont support the lyrics.Felicity is a closer fit for season A where Oliver got to be the steady and stable one. However Olivers final steps to being an inspirational leader as OQ and mayor happened postbreakup. Felicity had him in a transitional phase not as the man he would become.For comparison they have a couple of LanaClarkLois videos that I think fit the song way better. Lana had love for the man but fell in love with the sweet awkward boy he was. Lois fell for the more bold and confident man he became and she ended up having that man after he made his transition. It fits with the idea that two women got him in different stages of his life but they loved him so much in that stage that its bittersweet that they only got half of him. ,arrow,dcqv1r9,12,t5_2u4js

There was technically a serial killer on the loose and the city shouldnt just put up with that. Then it should have been made clear in season  when Oliver returns as the Green Arrow that hes being more mindful but anyone who willingly engages him may get killed.

She knew everyones secrets she was on the team shed completed a level of extreme competence in her training she had unique bonds with other long running characters she had people and events that existed only to further her narrative and theyd shed the need for her to be a love interest. She was finally the fully realized character she was set up to be in the pilot but sidelined away from in subsequent seasons.But then season  came along and all of that was treated as tangential she became Roy in season  and was killed off.

To me she never really fit being a vigilante that well and a lot of that is due to her being pretty much written out of the storyline. I feel like worshipping her Black Canary as many people here do only gives the writers credit they dont deserve. They didnt do shit for her and as a result her Canary was pretty bland. Its not Katies fault and the character definitely had potential but she was great as Laurel because the writers focused on her development.

10645855,0,t3_5s8lfj,Its not Merlyn as a character that is bad it is that he was poorly written and so were Olivers interactions with him. Its not the same comparison. Felicity is a terrible waste of space character but at least Malcolm is enjoyable to watch. Especially since his much needed move to LoT.Its all just a result of Arrows writers and producers moving to the flash and the few people who remained had to flounder in a dazed and confused mess to try and keep the show up to standards which spectacularly failed.,arrow,dde1dx4,2,t5_2u4js

10727709,0,t3_5tbcgt,Not a good idea IMOThere are several reasons why seasons  and  worked so well and  and  did not but lets focus on character. A big part of what made Oliver so interesting but also mysterious is how he could have this dual identity. The son of billionaires by day and the man killing other billionaires by night. Oliver had people in his life as Oliver and in his life as The Hood. However now almost everybody knows his identity and that just loses all of the duality that made Olivers past so interesting. Secondly there is the tension. In season  when Slade captured Thea there was so much tension Was he going to tell her  about Ollie? What is her reaction going to be? this made the episode really memorable keeping the viewers on the edge of their seats. If everybody knew about him all the tension would be lost.  Also the thing  could also be used as a major Deus Ex Machina.,arrow,ddmhehk,6,t5_2u4js
10733989,0,t3_5tjiv4,part of it which most people dont bring up is that she was a key figure in some poorlywritten seasons. Like if S had been amazing other than Olicity the Felicity hate would be nowhere as strong. Shes come to represent what went wrong with Arrow. Dont get me wrong she is a very clear symptom but shes not the cause of the disease. In search of drama they wrote her to be a very stern partner. I get it.  Shes in that same club with Skylar Lori and Betty White. But it was more than just the manufactured conflict between her and Oliver. They wanted to make Felicity a more integral and important part of the show but they did not handle it well. at all. They handled it so poorly in fact that the idea of her being in a romantic relationship with Oliver is enough to put people off of the show. But likewise there was pandering to a group that loved her so much that they only watched Arrow to see how her relationship with Oliver progressed. Vicarious living through the nerdy tech girl that could be you.She gets a bad rap. Oliver was keeping a secret family from the woman he intended to spend his LIFE with. thats fucking crazy. imagine if you found out one of your parents had a secret exlover with a child that they visited but never told anyone about. thats weird. People empathize with Oliver though. He just wanted to be in his sons life. Felicity is a bitch for not understanding.Oliver had a choice. He didnt have to make that promise but he did. And its not like he was doing it for the sake of the kid. He wasnt going to be a father to the kid. he was just going to be a guy that showed up every now and again.The right move would have been to leave it alone as she and the kid were doing FINE without him but I have a kid so I understand wanting to be a part of that childs life. But shit Barry found out...but anyway that was huge for a lot of people. and I get it. I feel Felicity overreacted. Not like her point was terrible but shes a hypocrite and she was overly harsh. Other thing is the wheelchair shit from se I believe. where she walks out on him. pissed people off. I get that for sure.   The writers chose to make Felicity kind of a bitch. and thats on top of her massively increased screen time....and the addition of her parents an episode about her past..replete with a hallucination...but the thing that pisses people off royally? the writers chose to make Oliver accept her behavior to direct what could have been anger at her...into a reflective sadness. like he deserved everything. this is why people rage. When dealing with Oliver Queen Felicity always had the upper hand. She was always right her feelings were always what mattered most. People identify with the main character Oliver Queen so this shit was infuriating. Basically the arrow staff wanted to capitalize on her popularity but fucked up. they fucked up so hard that a large percentage of the fanbase despises her. I dont. Shes OK but they fucked up her character by trying to force her importance.Even with shit like S Havenrock. Felicity helped save the world from nuclear destruction. like if she wasnt present k nukes would have decimated the planet...but she sent an errant nuke to Havenrock to avoid it hitting a much larger city. People rage about that and rage that the scenes shown after that didnt show her depressed and hating herself. its not about the billions she saved but about her not looking sad enough about the k she couldnt save. Thats just hate. But thats the result of the shit they pulled in S and S. Im not even going to go into Laurels deathbed shit about wanting Oliver to keep fucking Felicity or Ras chiming in on it. That was just silly stuff but no real reason to hate the character. Again I dont hate her but I absolutely understand why so many people do. Especially the people that are concerned with the showrunners and their preferences. They REALLY hate her. If you see someone randomly talking about Guggie or Guggs etc chances are they despise Felicity. she was a character shoehorned into situations she had no business being in and they tried to make her the ying to Olivers yang only they did a shitty job and it didnt work.Theres more but I need to go inside and get another drink.,arrow,ddn4pjb,11,t5_2u4js

You should consider yourself lucky that isnt even a thought in your mind. I as a black male think people should be able to protect themselves HOWEVER... I must consider the fact that a black man carrying a gun  instant stereotyping by authority. Black man get killed for no reason at all by simply being pulled over. Imagine if everyone had guns so a black man carried a gun to protect from his racist white counterparts then he gets killed simply for being a black man with a gun. A black man with a gun at supermarket will get shot for looking like a thug or criminal a black man will get shot for walking too close to my house with a concealed weapon etc. It will get worse for people of color.

10815398,0,t1_ddvho1e,Renee was made to be very sympathetic. The person most in favor of registries was the most violent criminal in the episode. After your statement about gun registries being unconstitutional I decided to do some quick digging and this is what I found gun registries are not ruled unconstitutional SCOTUS strikes down gun ban in D.C.The law states no registry but there are still registries states have some form of registry for firearms either partial or for some amount of years. DC gun laws rules partly unconstitutional for certain laws in place but the registry was still upheld.Your statement that it is flat out unconstitutional seems to be only partially true. The episode wasnt propaganda. It presented every argument that people normally present during a time such as that and doesnt weigh in either way. Its a show so the solution they came up with was magically great and thats obviously impossible but the message was still clear to someone not looking for political bias Talk to each other and respect each others opinions as opposed to shouting each other down. In the interview with Guggenheim and Mericle they even state they considered doing other issues like abortion rights but since guns are far more prevalent on the show thats what they went with. It wasnt overt propaganda as none of us know what their Guggenheims views arehe was the writer for this episode.

And because Moira pointed the finger at him not only did many of the inhabitants of the Glades escape but he was suddenly outed to the world as a lunatic mass murderer.

Even the Oliver Susan thing is connected and related to the story.  So as long as any stupid drama isnt involved and the story is good I dont see any reason to panic.

Structurally the storyline would make more sense that way because otherwise it just seems now that the characters fallen too much.

The whole DCTV crossover is ratings bonanza for the CW atm and even still these DCTV shows still generate the highest ratings for CW. Not to mention other tracking info the CW may find more valuable than liveTV ratings.

Theres no joy to be found my friends..Edit In case no one see the repilesFunny you say that. But I really dont. I just really dont like how Sara Laurel especially Felicity and to a minor degree dumb relic powered chick are written and portrayed. Theyre very selfish hypocritical whiny and usually are the cause of pointless mindnumbing melodrama.Compared to other fictional female characters like Hera Syndulla Star Wars Rebels who is a leader to a space faring team like Sara is supposed to be. But unlike Sara shes written like a actual leader with actual weight  She doesnt go around bemoaning to her team or becomes a pity child if and when one teammate does something questionable. or Sabine Wren Also Rebels in how she handles her family issues with confidence and humanity or Caitlin Snow  who struggles with the curse of one day becoming Killer Frost or Iris West standing up and fighting knowing she will die or Leliana Dragon Age or the Boss MGS  These are female characters with strengths among their faults they dont try to hide them or push them to others. Theyre actual characters with personalities and purpose. Unlike Sara Laurel especially Felicity and to a minor degree dumb relic powered chick who are just a composite of traits and nothing more.I could go on but clearly youre more interested in the Problem with Women angle and thats pretty sad.

11369819,0,t1_dfkpclb,Oh really? Because you know what the difference between the two fights were? Olivers plan was to lay down cover fire which would allow Barry to speed in and grab the staff and get it away from savage. You know what happened instead the first time around? Oliver directly attacked savage and left Barry responsible to free Kendra and Carter from their chains. While Oliver continued to attack Savage he knocked Barry out of the fight then after knocking out Oliver killed both Kendra and Carter. Now I will give you the fact that the gauntlets didnt work the first time around but no one could have predicted that. Hell Oliver and Barry only knew because Barry traveled through time. Thats not being smarter then Cisco thats literally having knowledge of an event beforehand.Anyways the second time around after Oliver got away with not getting dumped by Felicity and thus didnt go off plan and not have his head in the mission he actually did what he was supposed to. By first freeing the Hawks he allowed Kendra and Carter to attack Savage without being killed and laid down cover fire as well. Also the rest of team arrow actually showed up so they served as a distraction as well into Barry could go in and grab the staff before destroying Savage. The second time around no one including the inhabitants of an entire city dies. Literally nothing changes besides Oliver actually doing what the fuck hes supposed to do and not being stupid enough to leave half the team behind.As for Havenrock she may not have been the one to fire the nuke but she was the one who directed it towards Havenrock. Yes she was between a rock and a hard place but she still has to take responsibility for her actions there. You cant just erase the fact that while she had an impossible choice she still had a choice. Do I blame her? No but the weight of that responsibility still falls on her shoulders. And also redirecting the missile towards Havenrock... still counts as destroying it.,arrow,dfkqwph,5,t5_2u4js

11419601,0,t1_dfqe584,When I present a scientific quote nope they still choose. Im not assuming anything. They literally said in their videos that MG was not the showrunner of the Flash. Now they complain about the flash and hate on him when there is no relation and they know that. Also the claims that Willa were fired the one girl knew that it wasnt true as she had no proof but tried to present it off as a fact. That makes it a lie as she is not telling the truth about a situation where the truth is known. This wasnt speculation on her part. She tried to sell us the truth and wrap in her KC biases as well. Even for a second lets assume that they forgot about MG. Why hate on a person when you have no clue whether they have any involvement? Its still unwarranted hate.

11602502,0,t1_dgaunip,Hey its the show Im least enjoying this TV season but it is nowhere near Arrow S quality. Itd say right now its more akin to Arrow SA its not as intense as previous seasons but its still very much watchable. The relationship drama is a little more there than it should be but the main plot is given full focus. The problem is just that the main plot isnt really that interesting. This was the season that needed a nonspeedster villain but they still did it and now theyve stretched his identity reveal arguably the only interesting thing about him at this point to  fucking episodes. The repetitiveness has become too much.This is by far The Flashs weakest season but comparing it to Arrow S would mean its completely illogical overly dramatic poorly produced garbage and thats not the case. Its just not delivering the same momentum it used to thats all. I imagine things will start to heat up and become more enjoyable as we enter the final five episodes.,arrow,dgb5ig2,1,t5_2u4js

That does not mean he was a person of interest. Sara and nyssa both had to have told him his name if he did not already know. Just because he killed merlyn does not mean he was a person of interest.

You are very right about the screen time this late in the game IMO. Screen time is precious this far into the Season. Theres a bunch of storylines to tie up  Flashback Oliver story that we now know from Wendy Mericle will go further than the Island Oliver we first saw on the pilot Kovar storyline Prometheus storyline Talia storyline Oliver evolution to full GA storyline it is the end of the  years journey  and they take a all episode to talk about a break up that happen more than a year ago? I dont believe they are only catering the Olicity fandom not this late in the season when time is this precious. Im not in a position of knowing anything but if I was a betting man I would bet that something is going to happen in that episode that is going to resonate further down the line and not just related to Olicity.,arrow,dgogg84,2,t5_2u4js

11778875,0,t1_dgu3sim,A commendable sentiment but I think its safe to say that all three of them have no shits to give about what a bunch of delusional Stans think of them and their triangle. Theyre young goodlooking successful rich people in a field that is very hard to break into. Its just us that are having wars over this. Those guys are fine. Sure it may be annoying sometimes but Im sure they feel better after wiping away their tears with bundles of money while renewing their contracts for another year of playing superheroes. ,arrow,dgv68iq,2,t5_2u4js
11783384,0,t1_dgvnyga,Im not looking for flawless characters. But I am looking for someone I can at least sympathise with. Oliver is flawed but he has a good heart and always tries to do the right thing. When he makes mistakes I can at least understand where hes coming from. Rene refusing to visit his daughter is just plain selfish and I cant sympathise with him at all.  ,arrow,dgvonyf,0,t5_2u4js

11785038,0,t1_dgvuagh,When a large portion of an episode goes to scenes involving FelicityOlicityFelicitys family over making sure the stunt sequences of the episode are actually decent and not some pathetic Power Rangers dance competition then yes Felicity is the root of the problem. This was the case with an overwhelming amount of season fours episodes. Felicity is indeed not the only problem with season four but theres no denying that many of those problems were either tangentially connected to Felicity or more excusable than the Felicityrelated problems.So yes Felicity her relationship and her family are definitely one of the factors to blame for the pisspoor action sequences last year as she got more focus and screentime than they did. I get what youre trying to say and to an extent I agree but in this instance you are wrong.,arrow,dgvvfoz,16,t5_2u4js

11794120,0,t1_dgwgqko,I think alot of fans were also expecting her to go full BC when they found out her name was laurel. But the show runners wanted to show her dealing with stuff to develop her character. I think at the beginning of the shows run they forced too much of the CW relationship soap opera b.s. on her. But like I said if you ask  of fans who they would want s and s laurel or ss felicity you know who theyre taking.,arrow,dgwwj4o,1,t5_2u4js

11805255,0,t1_dgy3c10,Costume doesnt have to mean a leather fancy dress outfit. It just means a distinctive style of dress. Same as Scully cosplayers  they dress in a pantsuit with a red wig and ID badge but its still recognisable as the character because that style has become synonymous with the character. ,arrow,dgy604m,18,t5_2u4js
11805294,0,t1_dgy5rd7,Okay i did not downvote. I dont do that unless someone is being uncivil or inappropriateetc. I dont actually like the downvote at all. Im not like the majority of users here who downvote cause they disagree with what someone said. If you say so. Im going to stick with he is dead and not coming back.,arrow,dgy65ud,1,t5_2u4js
11810582,0,t1_dgxwxn7,Well not gonna lie I dont see the point of her to be honest as people were pissed when Laurel died so how does bringing in another woman with her mantle help? I know some people who were pissed when Laurel died and when Dinah was introduced they gave up on the show altogether. We saw Laurel work to earn the mask and Dinah walks in and gets it in like  weeks? Dont get me wrong I actually quite like Dinahs character but I dont see the logic in making her the new Canary as there shouldnt be an old Canary because to me the true Black Canary will always be Laurel.  ,arrow,dgyrqzv,1,t5_2u4js
