100578,0,t1_cepsee6,Since you say yes how did you develop this skill? I am dismal at identifying notes out of context  that is when Im playing the violin and have the strings as my guide its easy to know what note Im playing. But if I listen to a song or whistle something I have no idea what note that is. I had a friend in high school who could tell that the school bell was an E flat for example.

118352,0,t3_1vg1zn,Doesnt she mostly use an electric or amped violin?  Even though the sound may not have effects added it will still have a flatter sound compared to an acoustic violin.  Even an acoustic with a pickup will sound different.  Also I dont think she really uses the full range of the instrument often.  Ive only seen  or  videos of hers and I dont recall her going past rd position except for a quick run or something.  Id imagine if these factors are true it would give her a unique sound you can pick out almost immediately.  I own about a thousand discs with about  dozen different violinists you could blindly put a disc in and Im almost positive I could tell you what piece and what artist is playing.  Every artist has their trademark no matter how subtle.  Shifting style vibrato bow usage....all play a part in giving you your sound.  Compare Stirling to other popjazz violinists and youd find similar qualities.,violinist,cerwpdn,7,t5_2sbn3

At the moment I only use vibrato when I feel in tune and that my left hand is completely relaxed.I dont strangle my violin neck and if just feels like its the next step.Whenever I play it feels like my fingers have a dying need to use vibrato. I cant explain it. they almost do it by themselves if for  of it.So as far as the bad habits go I dont think its the case right now.What I do think is that vibrato can hide some intonation mistakes and I definitely need more work on intonation.,violinist,cpvahdh,1,t5_2sbn3

4999824,0,t1_cuongar,Thank you for this response.  I do agree that my husband can evaluate the bridge and tuning issues.  The pegs seemed to fit very nicely I know when my son got his cello my husband applied something to the pegs so the cello would stay in tune.  I would imagine this is possible for the violin if this seems to be a problem? When I researched these violins online I found that the basic Cecilios did have a lot of problems with the bridge shape just a basic arch instead of having one side higher than the other the fine tuning pegs not working or in some cases not existing on the instrument and the large pegs not staying in place at all.  However the Mendini was reviewed as having good functional fine tuning pegs the correct bridge shape and the same problems wit the larger pegs... solved by applying graphite or rosin to help them stick in place.  Its for those reasons that we went for the Mendini instead of the basic Cecilio  that and the fact that the Mendini is handcarved whereas the Cecilio is machinemade.  I guess another poster here said that was just a lie... and I have no real way to verify obviously... so I guess I wont put too much weight on that reason anymore.  Please correct me if Im wrong but what Im getting from your response is that with proper setup and attention given to whether the bow works well or not this violin is probably okay for now.  By the time she gets to a  size if not sooner were going to want to get or rent something of higher quality.  And of course we do need to have that conversation with the teacher.  ,violinist,cuonznv,-34,t5_2sbn3

5705910,0,t3_3t844y,And this hits very close to home. I was in the exact same situation at roughly the same age... So from someone whos been therethis is all assuming you do not plan on becoming a professional violinist but still intend to stick to your violin in the future maybe join amateur orchestras after you graduate or play some chamber music with friends whenever you have a bit of time it is extremely tempting to simply play through music it is extremely tempting to consider you only have time to practise when you have at least an hour ahead of you your brain is a wonderful thing as it will adjust what it perceives based on what you want to perceive meaning sometimes youll think youre playing in tuneon the beat when youre not really its just your brain adjustingAnd what you can do about it Dont just play through music. Practise. That means focus on a tricky spot and practise arpeggios scales shifts rhythms bowings Practise something dont practise for a specific amount of time. For instance decide you are practising these  bars and get them right. Dont just repeat the same thing over and over again for min and call it practise because it isnt. Have a schedule ready. For instance start with one scale and arpeggios long bows slurred then rhythms doublestops etudes then repertoire. For etudes and repertoire if you dont have time focus on maybe  bars at a time. And then the next  bars the next day. That gives you a feeling of moving forward as you dont practise the same thing everyday and its an incentive to actually practise tough spots instead of just playing through.  This approach also means you can fit a full practise schedule of scalesetudesrepertoire in as little as min if thats all you have. And actually I found it better to practise min every day rather than  hours on the weekend... That may mean some days you only practise scales and arpeggios. But violin is all about drilling something into your muscle memory and when it comes to that doing something frequently works better than doing it for long but rarely. Rely on self discipline not on motivation motivation gets you started self discipline and long term goals make you stick to something... record yourself. Thatll help you objectively identify issues which you can then work on dont forget to have fun on those days when you have more time do simply play through music especially repertoire youve practised in the past... Stay with your orchestra. Practise orchestra stuff as part of your daily or near daily routine I sometimes skip the etudes bit in favour of a tricky thing from orchestraAll the best.

5924983,0,t3_3wh4lf,Ive known a lot of violinists. Id say the higher tier ones make their living from either orchestra gigs or professorships and the lower tier ones do more private teaching and random gigs which is itself generally only supplemental to their spouses income. Quite a few people who never made it into a major orchestra but play violin as their primary vocation have spouses who are the primary bread winners.In other words if you want to stick with violin you should either be excellent and go all the way to the big leagues or marry rich. You cant be a primary bread winner for a family by teaching a dozen kids for week and coaching sectionals at a youth symphony.,violinist,cxwaoge,3,t5_2sbn3
5929921,0,t1_cxu0cmi,That seems... odd.  Have you expressed your frustration with it?  Setups music etc... During most lessons instructor asks me if I had any questionsdifficulties that I wanted to go over.  Sometimes shell ask after Ive played a piece or before we start. Maybe ask her if she has any tipsassignments for you to help you read the music?  If you have a list of items during your practice that you found most difficult and could you ask her about it if she doesnt ask you herself?That being said are you using something like the Suzuki methodbooks for learning?  I could already read music but I read somewhere that Suzuki mainly focuses on learning by ear rather than using sightreading to start.  Learners are not all made the same though so using eartraining only may not be something thats best for you at this time.If youve asked and been ignored... Im tempted to ask if there were other teachers you could go to?  I found foundations are really important and having a teacher that followsup on questionsconcerns a student has is also important.Heck I seem to place my shoulder rest in a different position every time and my instructor constantly corrects it for me. ,violinist,cxwxzl7,2,t5_2sbn3

6079603,0,t1_cygcryh,gt I want to try to teach myself the violin which I know sounds really difficult and I was wondering if you can recommend a cheap violin online.That sentence right there is pretty much setting you up for a fall. Its not difficult to teach yourself violin. Its impossible. First of all it wouldnt be teaching since that requires you to already know something. Its studying using information that comes from outside of you in order to learn something. Second there are a few really strong educational traditions associated with the violin and people who come from any of those traditions are thoroughly convinced it is really the only way to go. Much of available violin knowledge has never been published. It must be demonstrated to you and books about playing violin intentionally leave those things out because they are written under the assumption that you will be using said books under the guidance of a qualified teacher. If you find a teacher who doesnt come from a particular tradition or doesnt adhere to it or a different tradition they might have discovered that they like better they are not inside the loop which also means they probably are not actually qualified to teach. Its not about being elite and exclusive. Its about learning from one of the acceptable methods so that you dont hurt yourself and can produce a sound others actually want to hear. I hear stories all the time about independentlystudying violinists who actually think they are qualified to teach other beginning violinists as long as they can stay a step ahead of them. Talk about the blind leading the blind. It doesnt work that way but it is those same completelyunqualified tinkers who are making the vast majority YouTube violin tutorials. Those are loaded full of mistakes and incorrect information and until you actually learn to play the violin you dont have the knowledge to identify those things. Cheap violins dont function properly and because they do not function properly you will not be able to play one properly. The only way to be sure you are making a good choice is to get help from someone you know is qualified to teach you which is another reason to get a teacher. There are some links on the right side with information for beginners. I suggest you read those before you spend any money. Yes violins are expensive. Thats because they are handmade and violin makers understandably want to be paid for the hours of work required. Cheap violins are cheap because they are made of inferior materials at factories with undertrained and underpaid staff who know nothing about setting up violins properly and might not play the violin or have even seen one up close before the factory hired them. You often have to pay a couple hundred dollars or more to make adjustments in order to make a cheap violin playable and at that point you would have been better off just spending that money on a better violin. The safe zone in terms of quality is over the  mark. It is possible to get a good beginner violin for less but not for as low as  or really anything under  or so and definitely not without direct guidance from an experienced violinist in choosing a quality used instrument. Think of the expense of learning to play the violin as motivation to continue doing it so your investment does not go to waste and find a good renttoown option to alleviate some of the up front cost. Finding the teacher before the instrument is best but if you start at a violin shop you can kill two birds at once by renting and getting a recommendation for a teacher at the same time.,violinist,cygip4o,2,t5_2sbn3
6102020,0,t3_3z420m,The suzuki book IV has a good exercise for shifting to th position it starts out that you practice playing your st finger in st position for an F natural then th finger first position for B then shift up your st finger to that same B and then the same back down. its exercise expands on this with including the last  fingers and shifting up and down. You could do this for any position so long as youre comparing the pitch to make sure you dont chud it.Another thing that definitely will help your shifting accuracy could be pieces or etudes with harmonic notes. As the first natural harmonic on a string will divide the string in half to give you a tone an octave about the open string the second natural harmonic will bring the length down to a third which will be a fifth further than the octave and another harmonic should sound at a a quarter the length to give you two octaves above the open string.Once you practice it enough you should be able to modulate your starting note to get you very close to the note you need and adjust as you start playing,violinist,cyj8kbn,2,t5_2sbn3

9681630,0,t3_5dpkum,Id second the idea of going with an acoustic instrument. If there is a music department at your college you should take advantage of the lessons for nonmajors. This should let you use the practice rooms. Plus the lessons will probably count toward some sort of general education requirement. Failing that look to see if your dorm has any sort of practice or conference rooms available. I went to school at a major midwestern land grant university so maybe I was spoiled by the resources available.I will respectfully disagree with the option of using a practice mute. You lose too much of the sound of the instrument  no real sense of tone no sympathetic vibrations bow noise is just out of the picture and difference tones for double stops are just gone. As a beginner you need to hear yourself. Find a place where you can practice unmuted.The differences between an acoustic and an electric instrument are pretty large. I play both and I do the majority of my practice on the acoustic side. Electrics are generally very quiet leading to happier dorm conditions but you lose all the nuances that are there with the acoustic pretty much the same things that you lose when using a practice mute. With an electric there is also a characteristic sound that is hard to avoid unless the sound tech is pretty masterful and as a beginner you wont have a sound tech. You will sound electric.

9803752,0,t3_5fn1n1,SLOWER. Way slower. Too many notes too fast. It is better to do a simple song well than a more advanced one poorly. Focus on long bow strokes and a steady clear in tune sound. ,violinist,daliurk,11,t5_2sbn3
9831477,0,t1_daovc8n,A luthier will move the sound post relative to where the bridge has been fitted rather than assuming the sound post is placed correctly and matching the bridge accordingly. The bridge is designed to fit a specific spot on the surface of the violin which is often lined up with the notches in the sound holes. ,violinist,dap2a11,4,t5_2sbn3
9834572,0,t3_5g0qa8,i think in the case of practicing just  minutes a day a couple of scales will do. maybe an Etude just to stretch the fingers. Double stops octaves thirds etc. if you have even more time,violinist,dapgto5,1,t5_2sbn3

10285153,0,t1_dc9v98p,Thank you so much for the suggestions. I think you are completely right. I am planning to work on my practice schedule as wellshift to more frequent shorter sessions instead of less frequent longer sessions. I think i also need to just focus on one or two parts at a time as I think the prospect of playing the whole piece well is overwhelming me. If all that fails maybe Ill have a glass or two of wine first ,violinist,dc9vn8t,1,t5_2sbn3

10459311,0,t3_5p7s1c,I played the firstthird and fourth movement years back in my first year of conservatory. I absolutely love this piece. Working on getting those  movements up to snuff again and then tackling both  and  so I can finally play the entire thing.I think I love the third movement most. The combination of the slightly darker sounds of the GD string parts and the fast playfulness of the middle part really hits all the right buttons.,violinist,dcto2rr,2,t5_2sbn3
10533864,0,t1_dd0x0l2,Hehe yeah Im concentrating really hard and its apparently quite obvious. Im still pretty mediocre at reading music so the combination of playing violin  sight reading is almost a brain overload.Itzhak Perlman makes the best violin faces though.,violinist,dd24om6,2,t5_2sbn3
10548716,0,t3_5qxwo3,Heres the thing. Judges dont really care too much about flash they care about preciseness with the song at hand. Why do you think that judges included Mozart in the Wieniawski Competition? Mozart is what most consider easy repertoire yet it hearkens to flawless execution not flash. ,violinist,dd3tcoj,1,t5_2sbn3
10654071,0,t1_dderh0a,Yes. It turns out she even knows one of my former piano teachers.I even told her that I didnt think I could do that for even half the time without passing out from boredom but she didnt respond when I said that.Ill see how she responds when I tell her what I spent my practice time doing. I just wanted to check with people on here to make sure I wasnt wrong by not wanting to do what she asked.,violinist,ddevvys,3,t5_2sbn3
10661477,0,t1_ddflb08,Probably because they come pretty much standard on violins. Fiddlers and others who choose not to use them usually have to remove them. ,violinist,ddfnf2b,8,t5_2sbn3
10684897,0,t1_ddhoxgc,I had heard that piece before but didnt know the name. Ill definitely go for it it seems simple yet fun and I also need some practice on both vibrato and spiccato. Thank you very much!,violinist,ddi2ecy,1,t5_2sbn3

10862585,0,t3_5v8rlc,I would put a metronome to  and vibrato in th notes then triplets then ths then sextuplets. Do this in scales and start slow. Try connecting the vibrato between notes as you gradually increase speed.Then try incorporating it in your pieces by doing small sections slowly working to connect the vibrato again starting slowTry targeting sections with string crossings or shifts.Good luck!,violinist,de0edjx,3,t5_2sbn3

11040078,0,t3_5xlzmh,You can rent a good violin from a music store. There should be one local to you that services local schools or you can have instruments shipped from other stores nationwide easy enough.I found a nice refurbished violin from a local luthier dude is like  and buys old violins and fixes them up basically just as a hobby. Bought a fairly nice sounding one to my ear for  that was originally built in  in a nearby town so its sort of a cool piece of history. You can trawl craigslist and google around see if there are any luthiers in your area who build or refurbish instruments. You never know might find something cool.,violinist,dejdgay,3,t5_2sbn3

11279528,0,t3_60wrq2,This is often referred to as violins in the white and its a common practice  a shop imports such violins which are made by a Chinese factory or workshop and then finishes them.  is a very reasonable price for that kind of violin. Well set up thats a reasonable student instrument.You may find at some point in time that you are yearning for an upgrade. Your teacher might tell you at some point that you need an upgrade or youll just feel like you want more out of the violin than its giving you. But certainly dont feel like you need one until you hit that point if ever.,violinist,dfains2,2,t5_2sbn3
