You will see one bog jet that sticks out of the bottom thats the main you can take out and clean of you want but not necessary. In the centerish part of the carb there will vr a jet that  is recessed into the body of the carb. It will take a small flat head screwdriver to remove. You should be able to blow air through it. If you cant try cleaning it with pressurized air and some kind of cleaner. Or go to your local bike shop and get a new one there about .

I would advise to drive a bit far for the second opinion so you leave the reps territory and find a new yamaha rep to work with. Some of those guys have a stick up there ass.
