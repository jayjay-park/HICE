4421315,0,t3_3bo2wl,Id be willing to post uphand out fliers in a good chunk of the upper west side on the weekends. Once you work out getting the papers printed let me know. Not sure if I understood you correctly but thered be no need to pay me for actually posting these. If you can arrange with printing Id be more than happy to help disperse them. ,NewYorkForSanders,cso0mqp,3,t5_38117

5005819,0,t1_cuo9lh2,Hey! So I went to the meet up that umelonthief mentioned.  It was my first time there and it was amazing. Lots of information and people asking for help in organizing their own events or projects. Truly an amazing bunch of people. There were sign ups to receive information on projects or to sign up for different events. I signed up for the Berning Manhattan but also to do a tabling and to march in a parade. I dont know the official count but Id say a lowball estimate was around  people. So it seems like a pretty established group. And they meet every other week. Im not sure where in NYC you are but there were at least three or four people from Manhattan or Queens. You could always come check out what theyre doing and find a group near you. But seriously it was exactly what I was looking for. I hope it works for you too. ,NewYorkForSanders,cupe17u,1,t5_38117

6577991,0,t1_czxuf0z,gtYeah. You had to have switched in October of . Only people unaffiliated ie never registered or registered and never having been a part of any Party can register Democrat at this time.Im pretty sure this is wrong.Only unregistered voters can register and vote in the primary at this time.  For all nonDemocrat registered voters the deadline to change party and vote in the primary was in October.,NewYorkForSanders,czzpv3h,1,t5_38117

6723859,0,t3_47prvh,Same way as general. Go herePrint the absentee ballot and make sure you select primary election only in box .Since you have to mail it in and wait for them to mail you back an absentee ballot Id suggest you start this process ASAP! Id also suggest you call your board of elections Look up  a few days after mailing out your absentee request to make sure they received it and processed it. It took me mailing in my request twice for my Board to finally document the request.,NewYorkForSanders,d0et05f,1,t5_38117

6970602,0,t3_4b43vx,Someone on the berniebuilders slack team was putting together a list of proBernie student organizations at NY colleges the other day so you might want to check there.There is a socialist club at RIT have you tried getting in touch with them? I left contact info for someone who could give you their contact persons email in the berniebuilders slack unfortunately I dont have the link now. ,NewYorkForSanders,d16gdpf,1,t5_38117
7055546,0,t3_4c8uir,yes. the problem is its better to have a group that includes politicians and important people. I dont know if the Reddit group would hold any sway.heres what happened in  when election fraud was rampantthere is a difference here too. In addition to the usual shenanigans there seems to be a huge program which may have been rewritten or hacked. Campaigns use these programs to access voter info. They get the voter info from states and counties. Generally those programs dont change the originals but that is what seems to be happening now.,NewYorkForSanders,d1g3t0f,1,t5_38117

7177734,0,t1_d1u0n6v,Im sure you dont need to pay taxes to fund your multi party system.I doubt youre a european but if you are you should know things are different in the US and handled differently. We hate our two party system and to vote we usually have to register as a certain party. Unaffiliated usually doesnt work in closed primaries. We either register to independent democrat or republican. There are other parties but they are neglected from the media.Sorry that you all have advanced further than us but you have to understand were still in the dark ages.,NewYorkForSanders,d1u1kcy,1,t5_38117
