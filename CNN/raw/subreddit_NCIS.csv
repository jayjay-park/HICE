5055509,0,t1_cuuq34n,I doubt it would be tbh the ratings have been too good to stop. I think whenever the last episode airs it would probably be Gibbs handing over the reins to DiNozzo but theyll prepare for that because theyd most likely know that the season will be the last way before writing. I dont think theyll overdo it like when Gibbs left. They done it for the right amount of time imo.,NCIS,cuvdp66,1,t5_2rkjc

5695662,0,t3_3t1vwp,NCIS episodes that arent midseason or season finales which just cliffhang feel so weird.

6504393,0,t1_cz5b4md,Ugh. Never read the NCIS Facebook page or sites like TVLine theyre full of people that are apparently so emotionally invested into NCISZiva that Bishop is literally Hitler. I also hate the MY OPINION MATTERS stance that somehow Ziva has to come back just for them.
