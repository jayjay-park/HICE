936922,0,t3_24tyrb,Wow  hours  upvotes and no answers. This is inspiring. Im a student in env. sciences thats graduating this quarter. A buddy of mine told me that she just got hired to work at up at Big Bear a super cool state parkski resort near Los Angeles. I didnt ask her how she got that position but I suspect she went to USAJobs.com or actually drove over to the park rangers HQ to inquire. Mind you she told me this while we were on a field trip last weekend. The field trip was to Camp Pendleton a military base halfway down to San Diego that has some of the BEST undeveloped land in Southern California unless you count spent bullets or barbed wire development. We met quite a few people involved with the Department of Defense US Geological Survey Army Corps etc. and she was picking their brains too about how they got their current jobs  from what I overheard a lot of them previously worked with environmental contractors and switched over to do more land management work. If youre on a field trip or meeting with professionals in the industry I cant stress this enough NETWORK! If you show an interest in how they got their impressive job professionals are much more likely to suggest places to look and apply. Flattery is awesome shit to anyone. As for me I had a job interview with the Sanitation District LA isnt exactly know for its clean water. Its a chemistry job basically figuring out how concentrated is the pollution is before it get filtered from the water so even though its the closest thing to a real job Ive interviewed for theres a chance that a chemistry major graduate will be chosen instead. Still worth a shot at looking though  I found it via google. Last week there was a career fair at my school. For environmental jobs there was basically two choices public health or industrial compliance. Both of them are going to deal with legal work or chemistry so its best to be skilled in both and then convince the employer that you need someone with such a background. They could easily hire a law student or a chemistry student you have to sell them the idea that you can do both and is willing to learn a lot more!!!. The other option is to do land management so USAJobs.com is your goto. There was one interesting choice though at the career fair. Solarcity the rooftop solar panel installers had a booth. They were focus on sales and home inspection to figure out where to put the panels. If youre interested in sustainability this is your best bet! The home inspection job is going to be your ticket into the consulting world and its entry level too!If anyone else can chime in I would love to read about your experience. Good luck OP!,environmental_science,chas7eo,8,t5_2s90l

Then you want to pump it treat it and transport it.

You can very well get into it with an envi scibio degree I know of at least  people who have but I would also consider doing engineering as an undergrad. I did an envi sci and bio double major with a minor in chem and Im swamped on prereqs. At the very least take some of the requirements before you graduate if you end up going this path.Let me know if you want more information and Ill do some digging.

7101247,0,t3_4clyfu,Im about to gradate with a BSc in ecology and zoology and I minored in chemistry so I had to take  organic lectures plus  organic labs. I honestly chose my minor against the advise of my adviser and my school recently changed the curriculum so that ecologists only need to take intro chem. I have found that the organic classes helped give me a better understanding of chemicals and the world how they make certain products why its bad when plastic chemicals specifically HDPE high density polyethylene which if you take organic youd understand the chemical structure from the name and why polymers are bad enter the environment. But to be completely honest you can easily learn this from a brief organic class or just from reading articles. If you just want to do research in ecology its not very necessary.If you are curious about if grad schools or jobs will require this start looking into specific jobs or grad schools that are hiring now and see what their requirements are. I cant imagine that anywhere might require this. At most if you make it through with good grades it will tell them that you can work hard and understand chemistry which a lot of people in my classes did not want to do. That could help you stand out as a student. If its not required and you dont want to do work that would involve that kind of knowledge then I would suggest focusing your time on the classes that are actually related to what you want to do and not waste a few semesters spending all your time studying for something that you will rarely use and soon forget.At least this is just from my own experience. I wish I had focused more on my bio classes because studying for organic takes up a lot of time. If you think it might want to study how chemicals affect the environment take brief organic. If you need classes to make up the hours from not taking chem take recreation if your school offers it. A lot of those classes focus on outdoor skills that could come in handy doing field work! It would stand out to a grad school because a lot of other students probably decided to take chemistry.,environmental_science,d1lar3q,1,t5_2s90l
7497429,0,t3_4i15dr,Heres a website with environmental webinars I think its kind of pricey but they are supposed to be good. I dont think you need a masters but you should try to get field experience. If you are near a college try contacting some professors for volunteer opportunities. Even if you cant get science fieldwork try for stuff like removing invasive species at parks. If youre hired in an entry level position there will probably some shitty fieldwork in bad weather and you have to give some evidence that you wont quit in the middle. ,environmental_science,d2uf33p,3,t5_2s90l

9520989,0,t1_d9mevx6,gtWow! I would trade places with you. Extra points if youre in your s. Youre on top of your game!I appreciate that. I am  and I have worked really hard and have sucked a lot of figurative dick. I have been on this path since I got my drivers license and have planed for it before then. gtThe MS program isnt letting me in right away actually. I will be taking about  credits as a nondegree seeker before officially applying. So Im not even admitted as we speak. Only  of the  credits will be applied to my grad degree. I would have been skeptical too guy. My grades are atrocious!Im sure youre good degree wise then. I only have a BS from a good school with good grades. Ive been with the same company since college and I got really lucky. I started at k and moved up quickly...by knowing people mind you. gtAlso I met all their prereqs except for geology so Ill have to take that too. I got a C and B in bio chem and a C in physics. Its a long story for another day.... You can do it. No more Bs and Cs though. Those grades dont mean everything anyway. I had a stat prof that I just couldnt understandfigure out. I dropped his class and then had As in stats after that. Just dont put your undergrad GPA on your resume. gtI actually dont mind having to go out into the field a couple of times a week but I dont want to lose the office aspect either. Some fresh air wont hurt you know? A little fresh air wont hurt you know.  You sound like Kyles cousin from south park. You will be managing guys that can pick your teeth with an excavator bucket and in our case have had that capability since before we were born. Being a something boss sucks. Trust me. This is coming from a guy that could run not fucking operate important nomenclature  you aint that good nor have you been alive long enough a lot of heavy equipment. A something pussy is going to have it rough. Insert Navy Sealy copy pasta here I am a really not trying to sound cool. gtNo engineering program will take me now. So maybe some experience and a few years in the field then back to school for engineeringMBA. I dont mind going to school. I dont want a wife and fam. Or at least Im willing to push that til s when I have something in the bank and have loans paid down.Idk where to start with that. My fianc and I have decided not to have kids. She is a young scientist as well. Work makes it hard.  We both work  hours a week depending on whats going down. We college sweethearts grabbed our student loans by the pussy early on so now I get to pay for a house and land and  trucks and horses and dogs eating blue wilderness. Oh and chickens including the Tripedal ones.  But hey when we get married my medical insurance will go from  a month to . thats a plus !gtYour job sounds really good. Whats your official title? What can I do to get to your position?I have a good job. Oil prices have made it less good but we are solid. My official title is Project Manager. If you want my position in your s you need to be a sound scientist and gross a company  million a year for your first couple of years then keep up  after that. Shooting yourself or purposely driving your company truck into on coming traffic before your  am spill response is generally frowned upon. gtI was considering contacting parks department EPA or local firms if I can volunteer or come in and shadow. Its just that getting the foot in the door thats killing me right now. DO IT! That is what I did. It really helps in interviews being able to tell stories about catching gutting and slicing up catfish for rad surveys. Hell I spend my days off doing the same thing.  Well except for the not frying and eating the fish part. gtMy program is online so if I landed a job I would still be able to work and go to school.You are getting a masters degree in Environmental Science online? Again I dont want to sound like a condescending asshole but I have never hear of that. gtHow did you get to where you are?I think I covered that question but l hit the key points. Sucking the right dicks agin figuratively working like you earn calhour answering your phone before your boss managing people twice your age which requires not being a pussy.
