7429658,0,t3_4gwq2b,Blood Red was the first song I knew. Holy shit. Changed my opinion on what dubstep was.My favorites though would have to be One Click Headshot and Rock and Roll. He dropped the former into the latter at Buku this year and I went fucking nuts. The poor couple next to me both had their jaws hanging open while I was screaming along with the headshot sample and then started cracking the fuck up when I did it again for Rock and Roll.I have the Spor stuff Im not as big a drum and bass fan and the early spor is nowhere near the production value of his Feed Menewer stuff.Nowadays Im more of a GRiZ Gramatik Manic Focus Russ Liquid kinda guy. If you dont know any of those guys check em out. And if you do and already like them heres some more you can check out too. Exmag Vibe Street Wax Future Big Wild.,feedme,d2mpdwq,2,t5_2slzg
