911478,0,t3_22hp88,I took off  weeks to be safe. I wasnt sure how quickly or not I would heal and start to feel better. I have a desk job but I commute into the city which can be bumpy jerky and crowded. I probably couldve gone back after week  but at that point I figured why not have one more week at home to heal in the most comfortable setting. Week  I did hardly anything. Went to the Drs. days post op to have out my drains and had my husband shower me on Day . I am a baby about pain and sometimes get queasy or have total anxiety about stuff. I think half of I couldnt reach my arms far in certain directions but also I felt nervous.Week  I was up and walking more but still didnt like to pull push or lift much. I showered myself but it was so much easier having someone there with me to get me food or something to drink if I needed it. Keep in mind rushing to heal or not resting enough can keep you swollen longer and extend your healing time. THat is why I spent most of the weeks doing as little as possible.Week  I focused on getting my strength back. We went to do a short errand  days post op and I thought it was the perfect opportunity to get up and walk around because I hadnt done much more than go from teh couch to the bathroom to the bed. Well after walking around SLOWLY for mins mind you we were at a mall so it was stop and go my legs felt like I had just run a race after. So crazy. You dont realize how much being under can take out of you.ANYWAY that final week I started by taking short walks alone I would go to get a coffee and come back took my time And then I tried having people get me out of the house you may go stir crazyIm glad I took that time though. Its so much easier to be in your own home for comfort.,Reduction,ch7w34y,1,t5_2y2hj
1731535,0,t3_2drvtf,Try to have people visit you if you live alone or someone who you live with has a busy schedule. Day time television will be old and I become lonely easily if I am bored AND alone. Whereas you wont be able to do  of your normal activity you could feel this way too.I picked a new series to watch on Netflix  asked some friends and family what they recommended. I ended up with Breaking Bad and didnt regret it. Best show ever and it is was  seasons so it will soak up plenty of your time!! After your first week if you gain some strength back maybe take short walks around the block. I wouldnt go alone in case you need help. I found my body to be VERY weak post op...we went to do one errand days post op and I thought it would be a good opportunity to get out of the house and be up and doing something. I walked at a very slow pace...my legs felt like I ran a marathon after only mins out of the house.Dont forget to take it easy and slow. The more you relax the quicker and better you will heal. Once you sort of feel normal...soak up the time off where you can stay in your PJs!,Reduction,cjxfanp,1,t5_2y2hj

Its a type of insurance that I could be mistaken I think might require referrals from your primary care physician in order to cover a visit to a specialist like a plastic surgeon.

She put in my IV and started an antibiotic and the Dr came in to mark me up. The anesthesiologist came in to speak to me and was super nice. My mom and boyfriend came back and we were talking. Two nurses came to my roomman and a woman and the female nurse had my attention and was asking me all kinds of questions and the next thing I knew I was waking up in recovery. It was a cake walk. And when you wake up you are super sleepy. I was so scared I was crying in preop.  It seemed to be over in a matter of seconds and I dont remember even being put out. I had told the nurse I was nervous and I think they did a really good job of distracting me. I never saw the inside of the OR and that is what I was most nervous for. ,Reduction,d280nm3,2,t5_2y2hj

I only had a month in between when I scheduled it to when I actually had it so it wasnt a lot of time. I spent a lot of that time researching. Head on over to the Real Self Reduction website you can spend a lot of time reading reviews and following others through their journeys lots of pics to look at so you know what to expect immediately afterwards and in the months to come. It helps to follow peoples experiences who are just on the other side of surgery. You can ask specific questions about their surgery and recovery.I thought I would be a nervous wreck the day of surgery which was  so Im officially one year postop. I was nervous that morning getting ready but once I got to the clinic and started getting prepped I was at total peace because I knew I just had to do it and once on the other side I wouldnt regret it. I was confident that it was the right decision and put the surgery itself in my surgeons and Gods hands. I would do it again in a heartbeat no regrets. Just put one foot in front of the other and think of all the positives. I was so excited after I started healing and could go shopping for smaller bras and shirts.
