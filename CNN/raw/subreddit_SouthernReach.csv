1988540,0,t3_2feyks,Just finished this trilogy and I have to emphatically state that this is vandermeers best work. However I am split between two thoughts. That there are small details that I missed that clearly explain all of the mysteries that are left at the end.. That while there are mysteries they dont matter that this book is about atmosphere and character development both of which are pulled off with aplomb.The gene Wolfe reader in me wants to dig and dig while the Nabokov reader wants to enjoy it for what it is a beautifully powerful piece of literature. It Could be another true detective type thing something that shouldnt be mined for clues just enjoyed. That being said I believe they were always on earth just in some form that is not understood by humans. And I feel that that is one of the big points of the novel that we cannot always understand everything. That despite intelligence strength manpower etc. there are some things beyond us and we have to accept that. Hence the name. Just got that.As a side note Im so glad this wasnt finch all over again. That answered most questions about ambergris and after finishing I kind of wished it hadnt. But Im glad vandermeer is finally getting wide recognition.,SouthernReach,ckstirl,4,t5_32aku

4643943,0,t1_ctf35e5,I cant recall enough particulars of the other characters and some had hopelessly ambiguous ends anyway but Biologist Prime has the best outcome I think. She has effectively become the thing she loved a vast and strange colony creature its own ecosystem so her transformation wasnt the horror that others were. At least not to her. Shes even taken stewardship of Area X the same way she did as a student when it was hinted she beat up people trying to despoil a natural area she loved. Biologist Prime mops up the military elements formerly guarding the barrier when the border expands and seemingly becomes more permeable.,SouthernReach,ctfxncg,2,t5_32aku
