606849,0,t3_200c31,Thank you for such a great article. Pippa raises a very good question about volunteering in the developing world. I am completely agree with her that if you do not possess any particular skill she talks about manual labor you should probably try to find yourself in fundraising training or coaching rather thus you will be so much more helpful for a project. And I was very sorry to read about skin color as an obstacle in volunteering. People all over the world should be more tolerant and openminded. ,IS101,cg992mn,1,t5_2z79p
