2864684,0,t1_cnta5xl,As I was just saying to uGreypo itll still initially only support subs that I personally have access to... but Ive got plans for a furtherfuture version that will allow mods to invite uMegaMegaMonitorBot into their sub to achieve the same thing.The reason for this is that lists of membership are preloaded and cached by an external service that needs to be able to log in. An early alpha didnt have this problem  it actually used the users own account to get member lists  but this makes your web browser crawl really badly for several minutes every time you go to Reddit for the first time on a day which was just painful. So bot it is!I too look forward to your plethora of icons though!,MegaMegaMonitor,cntpril,3,t5_35vms
