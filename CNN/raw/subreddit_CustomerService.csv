3445631,0,t1_cpgperq,So the normal customer service options are out because you have a business line?Arent the business plans supposed to be better service eh?,CustomerService,cpl105l,1,t5_2s70c
3950208,0,t1_cr6ifb6,Yes I found it online. Not sure I will be successful but at least I can talk directly to them.,CustomerService,cr6k320,1,t5_2s70c
4771610,0,t3_3g92cg,While I understand the frustration with being out ... there is clearly something else going on here. The rep probably couldnt do anything and from what ive read here you sound very belligerent... so I can only imagine how the real conversation played out.gt Useless Pakis. Or whatever. They have almost  of my American dollars and I cant access my account or even get a refund from the fucks. This right here I think proves my theory. Sorry no sympathy from me.,CustomerService,ctw05tg,6,t5_2s70c
5506237,0,t3_3qi85a,pm almost  hours into the process. Got the same supervisor whod hung up on me back. He profusely apologized and said it was wrong of him to hang up. Finally after a conversation about the Mega Man  soundtrack yes seriously the supervisor finally admitted he COULD at least add SOME subscription time pending the ticket hed submitted. It took  hours to get him to add  courtesy days. Im exhausted.,CustomerService,cwfh147,1,t5_2s70c

If he spends enough money or is a good enough customer with the bank they might credit him a portion or all for goodwill. ,CustomerService,df73aln,0,t5_2s70c
