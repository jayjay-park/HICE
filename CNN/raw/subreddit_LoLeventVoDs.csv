160985,0,t1_cewngsd,As much as I dont like it either mods of rleagueoflegends were always helpful and would end up advertising our sub in one way or another.For example during the Worlds our subreddit was highlighted in header afterwards it was moved to sidebar just below the Worlds image and when I was looking for additional volunteers theyve also featured the post in header to help us get more attention.The real reason why they removed all subreddits from sidebar including ours is that Reddit has a limited number of characters that can be put in sidebar  and as rleagueoflegends was really close to that limit they had to come up with a solution. Sure that solution is not very helpful to less popular subreddits but something had to be done.Hopefully people will mention rloleventvods on main League subreddit from time to time so people who still dont know about it will learn about this place ,LoLeventVoDs,cewrpc1,1,t5_2ux5s

It seems gosugamers.net has some issues website is downpartially down so it causes our sidebar bot to mess up the timesor not show any countdowns at all.Issue is being worked on hope to have it resolved soon. Times are normally correct you dont have to use an entirely different website because of a onetime issue P.S. Forgot to mention that when these things screw up for whatever reason e.g. dont work wrong time wrong matchup its not really our fault.

3008588,0,t1_co8bba9,Thank you for taking time to write down the explanation. I can see where youre coming from and it makes sense in a way but Im still not sure how this sorting is so much of a problem. Ideally we would keep this format gtwd wd wd wd or wd wd wd wdBut that would mean we have to scroll down a lot. We used to have that format then we added only newest day at top and would replace it each week with with latest games and after some time some complained about it. Then we switched to this format and people still express their opinion how they dont like it from time to time. I simply dont see a way how to please everyone. Maybe if we were to create a wiki entry for LCS NA amp EU where only tables would be shown without any extra links and everything would be sorted as the above quoted format?

So you can directly play the highlights without opening a new tab.Edit However there will be no play button if game  doesnt exist... Is there anyway to not get spoiled by youtube suggested videos? For example if im watching game  of a random game game  if it does exist will be listed at the top of the suggested video so I will know for sure the team who lost game  will win game  and it stops me from watching game  as I already knew the result. Same goes for no suggested video as it means there is no game  and basically the team who won game  will win game  too.,LoLeventVoDs,ddb2kdi,1,t5_2ux5s
