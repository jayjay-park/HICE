And what a tale it is. Not a fictional biography or a period piece but an amazingly authentic or so it felt psychological portrait of the suffering artist. The story of genius twisted by delusion and crippled by hunger and depravation.It hasn t happened before. At breakfast the waitress asks what I want. I only take the continental buffet. I think at first that all the bread has gone but then I find some under a cloth. The toaster hardly even warms it up.In fact almost too well. The story is epic in its magnitude in its calm steady progress and unhurrying rhythm in its vast and intimate humanity.  Segelfoss By  Volume  Segelfoss Town Det Vilde Kor  at the Internet Archive Hamsun s only collection of verseThe Fall of the Sun God. Today Hamsun is read as one of the most talented writers from the end of the th century. Its dominant note is one of patient strength and simplicity the mainstay of its working is the tacit stern yet loving alliance between Nature and the Man who faces her himself trusting to himself and her for the physical means of life and the spiritual contentment with life which she must grant if he be worthy. However I have to add the followingHamsun s writing however is another matter. Whether we like the man or not it seems to me both foolish and pointless to continue ignoring the significance of Hamsun s work  if for no other reason than it s an important part of our literary evolution and denying this can do nothing but cloud our understanding of our ourselves as readers and writers. In regard to Hamsun s evolution as a writer it s far harder to describe than what came in his wake. Unlike virtually every other writer who has ever lived Hamsun seems to have emerged fully formed free from any definable literary tradition or even overt influences. Born poor in rural Norway Hamsun was largely selfeducated and lacked both the social and intellectual background usually associated with the European literati of his time..   ,shit1personcaresabout,cxbp1ji,1,t5_2tjkl
