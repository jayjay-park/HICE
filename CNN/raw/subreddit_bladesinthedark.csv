11352086,0,t3_620bgq,Blades seems to be engineered to be easy to run with fairly minimal prep.In Shadowrun you need to prep your target. What are their physical magical and matrix defenses?  Stats for the guards and so forth.  If youre really into it you might have some ideas about their patrol frequency or pattern.  Etc etc with shadowrun the list goes on.In Blades youre not necessarily keeping up with all of that.Lets say youre a few sessions in and the crew has gotten mired in a conflict with the Grinders.  You all sit down to play and someone says Hey lets hit the Grinders HQ!   The GM now just needs to know the type of plan stealth social assault etc.  And then the detail which is going to be basically the point of entry.  Alright lets sneak our way in.  Its an abandoned warehouse right?  We can go across the roof of a nearby building and see if theres a skylight or windows near the top of the warehouse.Then theres an engagement roll which basically lets us know how the actions begins.  Terrible roll?  Alright so your crew made its way along the rooftops and to the Grinders HQ.  You easily opened a skylight and climbed through descending on a fastrope to the floor quiet as a ghost.  The place seemed unusually quiet and still for a moment but then a blinding light washed over you as the Grinders sprang their trap  a half dozen or so of them move out from their concealment one holding a blazing ectoplasmic lantern. Their weapons are drawn and pointed right at you. What do you do now?or a good roll but again youd go right to the action they slipped in unnoticed to find the Grinders going about their usual biz but youd tell them something like that from their vantage point within the warehouse they can see the leader of the Grinders and hes apparently having a meeting with Lyssa of the Crows.  Theyre too far away to hear whats being said though what do you do?Players will react and use flashbacks or abilities to try to succeed or just make it out alive.Id wager that with just a little practice you could run Blades as a zero prep game other than character creation etc,bladesinthedark,dfiqkrn,11,t5_37dmu
