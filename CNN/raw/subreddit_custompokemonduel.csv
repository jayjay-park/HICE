11529650,0,t3_64jfra,I like them overall. I really agree with making Endure blue. That was my initial thought and I suppose Im not alone in that. But I think Endure works better thematically for Kabutops than Dodge. So Id say make it blue make it bigger and add a Wait time to the effect.,custompokemonduel,dg2vyym,1,t5_3jxce
11623829,0,t1_dgdi434,You got some points. PD is just like most tcg games including PTCG that the devsdesigners would periodically introducing new cards to keep the freshness. If energy cards have become a must or worse out of control then playing without energy cards will be a freshing thing. Some other thoughts. how do you think of the current energy breaker figures? Will you also consider introducing some more viable energy breaker figures?. In addition to the energy breaker plate we can havr some more energy plates that are doubleedges which you will consider activating it first and then break it with your energy breaker plate at some good time bringing synergies to it.,custompokemonduel,dgdkmbz,3,t5_3jxce

11673043,0,t3_66kceb,Also Im aware theres already a forest mystery marker I made this one different on purpose because AFAIK forest mystery adds grass type but the pokemon keep their old types as well like in the real game,custompokemonduel,dgj5m1k,1,t5_3jxce
