2168877,0,t1_clff6vz,Surprisingly the feet are not too bad. Bruised from tree roots coming downhill but I was lucky not to stub my toes on many rocks. Went up fairly early as I was working  til midnight.  Clouds hadnt been burnt off by then but it cleared to a nice day when we were coming back down.  from the peak looking ENE to the sea. Crappy phone pic as I packed light this time. As for crazy  yeah probably. ,Cairns,clfijnd,2,t5_2rhaq

2424812,0,t1_cmbb8uw,The year sevens will be integrated into the normal high school structure... although there are a few adaptations to that going around. Lots of schools are keeping the sevens in a separate space for example. Hard to say if theres anywhere to stay clear from. Despite any difference in reputation all the state schools seem to be much the same. Cairns SHS is the flagship. Lots of good programs and a good principal.Did you apply for a private school position or state?,Cairns,cmbexfk,1,t5_2rhaq
3143405,0,t3_2w2nzj,Just to hijack your thread for a momentThis is the second or third time I have seen recently that someone is moving to Cairns who has or wants to get into mediaentertainment almost all of them behind the camera ideas as well.  I know of a few other people who already live here who would love to get into that business as well.I know its probably just confirmation bias but Im beginning to wonder if there wouldnt be value in getting all these people together to see if something could be started up here.  Does anyone know if there already a club or interest group going around town?,Cairns,cont7nf,1,t5_2rhaq

4465255,0,t3_3bzi3u,As to the suburbs to avoid anything that starts with a W or an M is the usual advice though thats some pretty broad strokes to be sure.Cairns is fairly long and narrow bordered by the ocean on one side and the hills on the other so really people only talk about north and south though the original older part of the city sits between the two.  Working from the north going southNorthern Beaches Suburbs in brackets are not really considered to have a beach as suchPalm Cove Clifton Beach Kewara Beach Trinity Beach Trinity Park Smithfield Yorkeys Knob Holloways Beach Machans Beach.  The further north you go the further out of town but also the classier the burb conversely the further south the closer to the airport and its noise. So perversely you can end up paying higher rent at some of the more northern places and have to drivebus further to get to town.  James Cook University has a campus at Smithfield but theres not a lot of studentnightlife around here most of that happens in the city.  Some very nice places to live out here if you have a car.Oh it should go without saying in any of these discussions that public transport in Cairns  rates low on the appreciation scale. SunBus appears to have some sort of randomiser on their clocks and so hardly anyone uses them and so they dont put more services on and so less people use them...And beach isnt Gold Coast its tropical  no surf as such.  Still nice just dont expect big waves.Along the riversFrom the hills into the city Redlynch Valley Redlynch Brinsmead CaravonicaKamerunga Freshwater Stratford AeroglenSome nice places out here but again a car is pretty much an essential. Some areas around Redlynch have recently undergone a lot of expansion and so theres some nice new places here. Most of the other areas are well established places that have a mix of older homes and some unitstownhouses.  Generally quietish places to live.City suburbsNorth Cairns is along the esplanade between the CBD and the airport. Some nice new apartment blocks around here and some within walking distance of the CBD all within riding distance.  Lot of holiday apartmentshotels as well.Parramatta Park Westcourt BungalowOlder area of town that is undergoing in some areas redevelopment into apartment blocks or multi unit dwellings as they say. Bit hit and miss be sure to check it out in person first as pictures can be deceiving.  That said I live around here and I like it a lot. Can often find a good deal or at least something not horrible.The CBDLots of apartment buildings hotels holiday places as well as where all the action happens on a weekend. All the clubs and bars are within walkingdrunken stagger distance no hills pretty safe and you can go hang out on the Esplanade if you want to people watch. One of the more expensive areas to rent as youd expect but you can sometimes find some good deals.Edge HillOld classic area of town. Leafy streets and old queenslander style houses near the botanical gardens and various arts related sites.  Bit too old school for my tastes but obviously other people like it.  Not much to rent in here some small apartment blocks mostly long term family homes.  Suffers a little bit from being unfortunately close to...Manunda Manoora Mooroobool Whitfield Probably easiest to say just dont about this area.  Not actually a total writeoff its no where near as bad as the worst places in Sydney or Melbourne but it would take too much time to say what was and wasnt OK in here so just give it a miss unless you are really stuck. Someone in this subreddit may want to speak up for legoland a few blocks around Springfield Crescent that for some reason have something like  or  unit complexes of various sizes but Im not a fan of it at all.One of the streets in Manunda recently got famous for all the worst sort of reasons.Now were headed SouthEarlville is a little bit like Edge Hill but not as well off.  It definitely suffers from being between two of the worst burbs in town Mooroobool amp WoreeWhiterock.  Further up the hill sides you go the better around here.  Same applies to nearby Bayview HeightsWoree WhiterockSee what I said about the other M amp W areas above.Mount Sheridan Bentley ParkI always forget this one when I mention the Ms amp Ws Mt Sheridan used to be called Centenary Park.  Still its all very suburbia out here   sq m blocks with a small patch of grass two cars and bins out each week.  Terrifies the hell out of me.Edmonton Gordonvale are two sortofseparate from Cairns towns that are fast becoming swallowed up by the expanding suburbia.  Nice mostly if you like that sort of thing still have a bit of the feel of a country town moreso in Gordonvale but within an easy drive of the city. Again car essential.So thats the summary.  Of course other people would have other ideas and are free to make their own comments.  There is no area except for maybe Woree or Mooroobool that I would say to absolutely unquestionably avoid but the big factor for you is probably transportation.  If you have a car then there are lots of options. If you do not and want to be near the city where the action is then you will want to stick with the city itself Cairns North maybe Bungalow amp Parramatta Park.  Streets like Lake St McLeod St Grafton St and Martyn St are going to show up in rental searches.Hope this helps. Others are free to add their own opinions of course!,Cairns,cstiu5y,4,t5_2rhaq

Im not sure how that compares to private practice fees.Grain of salt here too my memory isnt perfect but if you can call or visit them if you want exact info.Another thing is though there is usually a wait to get an appointment go QLD health am I right but I dont know what thatd be like at the moment.Edit structure and readability,Cairns,dfgaw7g,1,t5_2rhaq
