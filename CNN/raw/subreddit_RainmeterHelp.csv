8735899,0,t1_d6xls7g,This is currently what I have done with Rainmeter as you would expect clicking on any of the icons in the grid layout would open the respected application. Clicking any of the three buttons in the top right would execute sleep mode a restart or shut down. I was wondering how I could implement a similar skin that would close all applications upon clicking it but recently used a program called CloseAll which for some reason would not close all my programs It would leave Skype running.. every single time. So I decided to remove it for the time being until I found something that worked but unfortunately have stumbled upon nothing yet.,RainmeterHelp,d6xmvpr,1,t5_2yd1r
