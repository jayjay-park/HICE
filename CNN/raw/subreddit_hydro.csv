Id still suggest you use an organic medium as you will have to water less frequently. And there for use less water and nutrient and ph solution thus saving money because with DTW your throwing it out each time. Also please dont waste your money on buying hydro things like the mega gardens you can literally build that for  in an afternoon.

640170,0,t3_21f80k,Hey MK had some comments while I was reading.gt I better get going since the seeds should be done with germination in a few weeks.Lettuce germination should be done in  days and maybe after  days it would be ready for transplant into a system not a few weeks!gt maintaining the right nutrient level is tricky.  While Ill be taking conductivity readings and adjusting the nutrients accordingly the conductivity readings cannot tell me which nutrients are deficit.  What if the poor lettuce is lacking nitrogen yet I decide to blast it with potassium?Adjusting the EC of the solution and keeping it constant I believe I grew my lettuce at .. EC is all you need to do.  To tell what nutrients are in deficit you need some very expensive and complicated ionsensitive sensing equipment which given that you write that you are lazy are likely beyond the scope of your project.  Its also worth mentioning that they are completely unnecessary.  That sort of thing would be appropriate for a massivescale commercial grower who was optimizing the economics of his operation by making sure the plants had exactly the nutrients they needed.  For a simple home grow of lettuce using a vegetativestyle nutrient where the NgtP and K is decently high I think I used  youll be fine.gt High powered LEDs let out a lot of light and are more efficient than others.  Im ok with paying more  although I am also interested in the difference between DIY LED fixtures and buying an equivalent.Again if you are lazy building a DIY LED is going to be beyond your scope.   I did it but it took a huge amount of effort in finding the right parts and doing the construction.  On the other hand the purchase price for LED lighting is really really high if you dont make it yourself.  But still pretty high if you make it yourself.  I made a light that outputs around  lumens and it cost me around .gtThe requirements of the LED fixture includes    Enough light for the plants to go through a healthy grow and flower growth cycle    Ability to automate time on and time off Youre growing lettuce which you dont want to go through a flowering cycle.  And automating time onoff is a simple  light timer from Home Depotetc.As for the construction of the system looks like youve got the right parts.  For the electronic control Im really interested in it.  Id love to eventually set something up with a similar pHEC sensor with automated control of pH.  Very cool stuff.,hydro,cgd1dig,2,t5_2rbou

6064130,0,t1_cyeghcg,Ive never linked a PAR chart for algae even though my guess would be that PAR for algae and most ground plants would be very similar data. Here is the PAR Chart from the link you posted which is almost identical to the one I have posted in the past. The most helpful diagram from that study would be this one and there is a couple things wrong with it first the prices of the LED fixtures are inflated and making the  year efficiency seem worse than it should be another reason it is wrong is because of the usable photons from LED is focused more and you can easily utilize them for a practical canopy set up. HPS has a massive canopy penetration that is not even which makes it hard to use all of the light effectively. The chart also does not factor in costs of removing the massive amount of heat from the growing area which is absolutely necessary for HPS. My  figure was wrong sorry about that  i was comparing LED to florescent electricity consumption when I was writing that. LED is more like  less wattage than HPS if you are comparing photonswattage and that  would be better still of you factor in practical photon usage.Even if you dont agree with any of this I can say from experience that LED is the most efficient. I use HPS florescent and LED when growing and my results with LED are always greater I use kwh meters on my plugs which is where I am getting my efficiency opinion.

DWC should have minimal nutes the root exposure is ten fold and correlates negatively to nutrient solution potency.  Water changes can be stressful to the root zone because a lot of times the mixing of the nutrients ph up or down and removing of beneficial bacterias can destroy the ecosystem that has been established.  I recommend  water changes to avoid removing too much bacteria.  My recommendation  give them the lightest nute solution with a shot of some root enhancersomeone suggested Rapidstart not a bad one and pretty cheap.  Root enhancers contain some basic hormones and can be thought of as a kind of steroid.  Leave it alone for a week and then try to trim some of the dead roots off once you have sufficient new growth.  ,hydro,d3wb24s,2,t5_2rbou

The drip system seems harder to control the amount that you are watering the plants. Which way would be generally the easiest way to control nutrients. To me it seems much easier to have a system where you turn the water on maybe flood the system then turn it off for  minutes or however long where youre not trying to control a continuous drip.Also one thing I did not see in those articles you posted  what is the best method to start plants.  Do you have to start them in soil or is there a method for sprouting them another way.  I know a lot of people use those little cups to start plants in but I would really rather stay away from soil if I can.

8776687,0,t1_d72o4op,Hello  radejr     I seriously doubt you would need to have the  watt bulbs places less than  feet apart. But lets say just for the sake of argument that is the case  watts for  of them is still less than half of  watts. Again watts is not only a measurement of electricity but also heat.  watts is far less heat than  watts.   Sure you dont want to limit yourself but specific applications require specific solutions. Not to mention having many lower wattage HID lights instead of one or two high wattage ones not only increases your coverage area but reduces heat distribution and increases configuration possibilities. In short simply increases the possibility not limitation them.   Amazon isnt a LED light manufacture. Buying direct from Amazon doesnt insure anything. Amazon is a collection of retailers trying to sell their products. Amazon just gives them a place to display their products. You still have to research the actual manufactures. Amazon doesnt do it for you. Cheap LEDs produce cheap results. If you have been using them and have specific hands on information I would be interested in the details. P.S.      Yes I know they make LED replacement bulbs for T and T light fixtures. But that dont change the fact that just because you can find a LED to fit the light fixture it isnt likely to work well. Fact is most people who try them have negative results. Or at very least no savings in electricity.             ,hydro,d72r5gx,0,t5_2rbou
