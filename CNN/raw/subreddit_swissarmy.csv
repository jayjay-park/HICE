1965300,0,t3_2h6ghd,Id like to hijack this thread to ask a similar question. Sorry OP!My father is a Swiss citizen and through him Im a Swiss citizen. Ive lived in the United States my entire life.However I am considering some day moving to Switzerland or elsewhere in Europe my right to live and work in the EU What Im unclear on is how this will translate into Swiss military service. I know that while I live in the States Im under no need to participate in the Swiss army but that if I move to Switzerland I will. What if I move to other countries such as France or the United Kingdom? What counts as moving  Im planning on studying abroad in Europe this coming summer and while Im sure spending a couple of months in a study abroad program wont trigger anything if I decide to stay a while longer Im unsure of what might be legally triggered.,swissarmy,ckq0qfx,3,t5_2waom

Including a trip to the skid pad full day the off road course half day etc. Its a lot of planning and resources and you need ZMBM to instruct.I believe theres a way to get signed off for PW but then youre limited to the SkodasPeugeots.Tldr no.,swissarmy,d1j2fvo,3,t5_2waom
