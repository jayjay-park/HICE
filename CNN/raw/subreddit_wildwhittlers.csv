I made all of them out of basswood using a swiss army knife Victorinox Hiker a Wood burner and rough grit sandpaper I stain them with a oil based clear poly.

Cheat and drill out a hole to work around itll save you time aggravation and possibly blood.   Work in your comfort zone and take breaks.  Bad things happen when your hands are sore.   First projects will look rough and a nice looking result is usually more work with sandpaper than the blade.   The important thing is getting comfortable with the knife and learning what cutting strokes work for what purpose. ,wildwhittlers,d5u3vq8,3,t5_2wa99
