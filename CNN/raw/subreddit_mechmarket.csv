Rather than hope and dream that Im going to get a clack or cherry blossom set for my HHKB Im just going to start making my own stuff.

7496649,0,t1_d2ubh36,Yeah! Ill start with some of the characteristics of the plate without switches. It can be twisted just as much or even a hair more than an aluminum plate although whenever you flex it like you would when you press a key it is stiffer because of the weave. It is very light and sound does not seem to resonate as much as metal plate would. With switches it generally feels stiffer overall.,mechmarket,d2ubvyg,1,t5_2vgng

7624657,0,t3_4jr3n6,Serious Question Why is the mod team so concerned with thread crapping in the first place? What is the harm in a seller having to explain their prices or their practices?Even if someone says This is the most priceinflated Hyperfuse I have ever seen there will still be someone that can and will buy the set no matter how overpriced it is.Ive had robust exchanges with users about pricing only occasionally within the sub rules and sometimes the person will come around sometimes well disagree and theyll keep their original price sometimes Ill get a really nasty PM and Ill cry myself to sleep s.I tend to agree with other users that say this isnt a neutral marketplace if you cant have these discussions. Would you prefer we had a Meta thread when someone inevitably makes a  on Hyperfuse?There isnt a mechanism within the rules to discuss pricing issues. We have no ability to counter the most undesirable parts of our community. That as much as price shaming drives users to other forums.,mechmarket,d38vsgz,3,t5_2vgng

JDCarpe and Ellispe have had their accounts frozen very recently.gt Well see which way it goes if theres enough demand I might ask them to throw two scooped FJs into the order.

7807088,0,t1_d3tkppd,The black and green colorway with those symbols seems better suited for something like DSA. Its more modern.

7955427,0,t1_d4a8ow2,Ive just had a look and theyre  with everything Id need. This is a hobby that Id like to get into because its something I use every day. But having keycaps that are worth nearly x the price I paid for the keyboard at this point seems a little excessive for me. Its a hard one because they do look so good. But my first goal before spending any kind of money like that is to make my own keyboard.,mechmarket,d4a9jhq,1,t5_2vgng
7955583,0,t3_4o74nq,We have almost exactly the same HHKBs its almost comical how similar they are.

And I have a single G done under the spacebar. I dont know if you will get your asking price although being in EU does make some of the stuff more expensive to acquire.

7971083,0,t3_4oezm6,So my parents divorced when I was rather young. And then my father went on to live in a different city and a different country even so you understand he was a rather distant figure for the most of my life even though I did visit him now and again. Also both of us introverts we never developed a very intimate relationship.Still he was totally there for me every time I needed something. Every single time. He always did come to save me whenever I fucked something up in my life which happened fairly regularly always coming up with a practical if often uncomfortable solution that always worked out very well. Would you believe Ive never told him I love him? Oh well it takes a giveaway contest to make me write down that I do in fact love my father .,mechmarket,d4c0wv7,1,t5_2vgng

10079618,0,t1_dbldkf6,I agree with that I do my best to put whatever price I actually sell it for in the thread  but the flip side to that is when people post a WTB thread where the seller has the advantage and pays more than the market has listed... honestly it is just a system that is going to be flawed no matter what anyone does because people are inherently selfish. People cant agree not to overpay because someone will always want it bad enough people cant agree to undersell because no one likes leaving money behind.I am pretty much over artisans  I occasionally enter sales these days because I want to see the artisans but I usually trade it soon after... I wish I could see more of these up  close without having to purchase them honestly. I usually try to trade for sets though  which is a market that I see heavily following a similar trend look at Carbon or the fact that I just spent  on  ergodox.,mechmarket,dble7yu,1,t5_2vgng

Im giving my numpad section of Modern Beige to my friend who got me into keyboards so he can deck out his QuickfireTK and if only Ill have more money for shippments and be better in making keycaps Im sure to have some giveaway just to give back to the community! D Oh and I also took part in Joihas raffles for the charity if that counts.  Yes I use MX stems and I think Ill be using them for a bit.EDIT I know I wont get another ticket I just wanted to say that your keycaps are amazing! D,mechmarket,dcgp304,2,t5_2vgng

People sell the fakes all the time and Im pretty sure there are a bunch on taobao. How is it any different than KKC selling them too?

10639755,0,t1_ddcj9x5,You have a very good point when I was an established member on a previous forum obviously it was much easier to show a history of activity and establish a trust relationship based off that. However on reddit Im much more of a lurker so its difficult.Someone wouldnt necessarily have to ship me an entire kit to assemble a board only the PCBSwitchesPlate would be fundamentally necessary which would be difficult to offload if I were to run off with your parts. That plus the fact the keyboard community isnt very large it would be pretty easy to find out if I were trying to sell a portion of someones kit.Also Im streaming these builds on twitch as kirkle kind of as a educational thing but also to help establish myself to redditors who are interested in my services.,mechmarket,dddeqq0,1,t5_2vgng

I mean its your choice Im just trying to say that you should get something higher quality that will last longer and have a standard bottom row so you have more replacement options for caps. We wouldnt hate Corsair nearly as much if they just made their bottom row standard and actually had a decent quality control process on their boards. Also knocking off some of the price wouldnt be a bad thing either since you can get something like a Ducky Shine  with a super thick steel plate and much higher quality caps and lighting for the same price as a K Lux RGB.,mechmarket,de2r2do,-2,t5_2vgng

11125392,0,t3_5ydt7w,Bad news. My PCB came with some damage on it so the insides were exposed Gold traces?. Im hoping I can get a replacement as the exposed area will corrode over time. And I can confirm that there are stabilizer issues with this plate. The metal bar of your stabilizers will hit the top of the plate sadly. Im hoping new plates will be possible to provide but I kind of doubt it.The annodization has a rough texture to it but is well done in terms of looks. Its pretty neat!Edit Was just told a replacement PCB may not be possible but well see as Im waiting for an update. Keeping my fingers crossed and Im hoping  didnt just go down the drain. Also my acrylic spacer wasnt cut correctly and is not flush with the case. That too wont be replaced. No replacement plates will be going out so your only options are to dremel the plate or deal with the reduced travel due to the wire hitting the plate. Edit  I think you can avoid the wire hitting the plate issue by using a Winkeyless  PCB as the stabilizer wire goes outward instead of inward. Ill report back if I hear more news about it. ,mechmarket,det1y40,2,t5_2vgng

11665154,0,t1_dgi95s1,edit As a bit of context the deleted comment was referring to allowing international winners to pay for the shipping themselves which is unfortunately not allowed in the US for giveaways.Hey mate  in the States if you run a giveaway a participant cannot pay for anything including shipping or else it could be subject to determination from the Federal Trade Commission FTC as being an illegal sweepstakesstyle promotion that requires payment. Therefore if a sponsor wants to run a giveaway based in the United States they MUST cover shipping or could have intervention from not only the FTC but FCC as well given sweepstakesgiveaways generally have a No Purchase Necessary guarantee.I realize that its not the best option to not be able to offer these giveaways to everyone in the world but I try my best to work with those outside of the U.S. to find the cheapest ways to ship the majority of my items. I also maintain my business within the laws that Im allowed to operate and unfortunately allowing the payment of shipping is not an option that I nor my legal advice believes I can offer.I understand you may not find this to be the most salient solution but I hope you understand that most vendors would love to offer every option and that there are restrictions in the background that may not be apparent.,mechmarket,dgi9dr8,8,t5_2vgng
