120253,0,t1_ces1b6r,I dont know either otherwise Id be writing my own ruleset! Ideally the casters should know how their spell works and not require much knowledge on the part of other players. a lot of the Amtgard spells seemed to require that. like if you put down a red ribbon the mage knows its a firewall and what it does but the other players might not.

537760,0,t3_20agvf,The Larpcraft system is intentionally system in this way. Essentially a hit to the limb makes you lose the limb. If you lose three limbs youre dead. A hit to the torso gives you a mortal wound causing you to bleed out over five minutes after which if you dont receive any healing you die. Should you take another hit after receiving a mortal wound you die. There are no hit points to calculate and every hit of every weapon swords axes clubs arrows throwing knives etc does the same.What prevents you from dying immediately is armor. Depending on what armor if any youre wearing you get a certain number of armor points. I believe light armor basically leather grants  and it goes up from there but you do have to both have the appropriate skills and be wearing actual real armor for it to count. Certain spellsskills can also grant additional armor points. Armor points are essentially a number of hits you can take before the hits count so if youre hit on your armor you can call armor and it doesnt count. Armor points are global so whether youre hit in the chest or the leg it still deducts from the same pool. Additionally if youre hit where youre unarmored too bad you have to take the hit. After a battle armor must be repaired to regain its armor points.,LARP,cg1ef2n,3,t5_2rl8h

904618,0,t3_24a031,The best suggestion i can give is that fancy clothes back in medieval times were usually those that were difficult to make or were of rare materials. Since these days we are able to machine most of these it makes   making what would be considered fancy clothes a breeze. Use materials that could have been made in a fantasy setting but would have been difficult to make or would have been made by a grandmaster of their craft. Here are a couple examplesAbove is a picture of Tyrion from game of thrones. His doublet is made of a filigree leather that would have been EXTREMELY difficult to produce in a medieval setting and would have been very very expensive which shows his station in the show. You can get material like this from various fabric stores or online for a fraction of what the average lord and lady of the time would have paid at the timeHere is a doublet i made for one of my more fancy hoblings It is a quilted harlequin pattern that is a rather shiny silk. The fabric was on clearance and it came in that diamond pattern which would have also been notoriously difficult to make and expensive due to it being silk. the silk backing has a cross threading that makes it change colors based on the angle you look at it again very expensive to produce in a medieval setting. I added buttons later that were also very period and very lavishUse modern technology to your advantage to make your character look super fancy for a fraction of the cost!,LARP,ch73zjk,1,t5_2rl8h
931024,0,t1_cha04xz,Homemade for super cheap! With a bit of elbow grease It will become a much better tent this was basically just proof of concept. What you do is get one of those parasails from deck or patio furniture and then sew long segments of cloth to its outer or inner edge. Preferably inner that way if it rains the rain wont slide down the top and into your tent. But then you unroll the cloth and fold it in. The extra cloth at the bottom makes for a make shift flooring and cushioning for your tent.Improvements I will make are going to be a rope down each segment to give it a more refined look and extra stability. A further arched top to the tent. and a better doorway by adding an extra layer of cloth that can then be hung as a overhang. ,LARP,cha41in,2,t5_2rl8h

1165364,0,t3_27fntl,The way that death is handled in almost every game that I play drives me nuts. Death is the most important most unknown most terrifying most thrilling part of the human experience. And at LARPs it becomes this nonissue. Oh you died? Haha! Oh well. Resurrect! I find it extraordinarily difficult to RP that mentality to immerse myself into a world where people are functionally immortal. I find it very difficult to tell or experience meaningful stories where such an important part of my real world experience is sharply curtailed by game mechanics.To me its all about vocabulary. If you want to take combatants out of a combat put them NEAR death. Give them a WOUND. Maybe even a FATAL Wound. But if theyre within their healing timeframe let the healers bring them back. I have to suspend less disbelief to believe that a fighter recovered from a mighty blow via magic than it does to have that fighter traverse the great unknown and come back relatively unchanged. ,LARP,ci0q1cr,1,t5_2rl8h

Its an evil religion and outlawed... anyway there was a player once who would make a new character every month or so.  Hed play this new persona for a game or two make friends etc... find out info store it away.  Then hed go back to his real race for a month or two then perhaps the old one or a new one.  If he wanted to do evil things like kill or steal hed obviously make a new persona or use an old one he doesnt care about tarnishing the reputation with.It was pretty crazy I dont know how he kept his lies and stories all straight.I think if I were to do something like that Id probably play my normal race on a daily basis then use the false race for a random person to handle my nonlegal tasks...

Give them out for giving you or somebody else a helping hand or for doing well in a game.  After you do this for a couple of months or upon getting rid of all of your coins start to offer your help or services in exchange for a small fee.  Encourage others to do this as well.It may work it may not.  But I feel that the best way to help with distribution is to distribute something new.

I think this is how it works Basically two major factions in the nation form the core of the two teams and everyone who want to take part picks a side. Theyre not necessarily balanced. Everyone else takes cover. One goal it set at one end of the Anvil the IC town it takes place in and the other goal at the other end and the teams are allowed to do anything they can to get the ball to the target goal short of outright murder. The game last two hours switching ends at half timeThe first time this game happened at an event there were more injuries during the game than there had been during the major battle against the barbarians that morning!  Deaths have happened though and there are always accusations of excessive force. Its half the fun Technically after half time. This was determined when someone too young to take part pleaded with his dad to be allowed to hold the ball just once during half time drinks and then sprinted to the goal before anyone could stop him.

I can only encourage you to open your mindset on the subject in the future and really evaluate if the use of real pejorative language and real cultural traditions is necessary for the portrayal of the trope in the future or just a convenient crutch to fill out the exoticness of the role.

But if your spiked metal ball wont hurn anyway and isnt that heavy its not effective. And its easier to block since it has a large area.Meanwhile weapons that normally wouldnt cause that much damage only need to touch to be considered a hit.And aggressive styles generally predominate since you can just charge and try to touch your weapon on the other in some way.Im trying to compensate for this with the mechanics. With things like a skill for heavy weapons that pushes the enemys weapon far away. Outside of larp the most preferred choice is the sword amp shield,LARP,cwm7tc1,2,t5_2rl8h

From the perspective of the existing community someone playing on their first day and someone playing th level Wizard are both noobs.

I recommend you attend some of them and look for people in the local area who might be interested in joining you  just dont be too pushy about it. The local community is generally great at supporting other LARPs in the area if youre willing to support them the same way.Some of the local stuff to look atLive Effects hosts several different games Live EffectsDying Kingdoms is also local to the SoCal area Dying KingdomsTwin Mask is a fantasy game that generally runs near the San Fernando Valley Twin MaskStarship Valkyrie is a Sci Fi game similar to Star Trek where players play crew members on a ship Starship ValkyrieRendalir Remembered is one of the most recent and its an epic fantasy with gods walking among mortals openly more like Greek myths.In terms of rules advice Id suggest going with rules that support the style of the game and the setting.

You can match the rough colors and shape of an era as step . And  of people wont see anything wrong with it. You could also use eraappropriate materials say fine wool instead of American cotton. And  would think its perfect. Then you could use traditional dyes instead of modern ones. Then you could use traditional methodes for dying say using fermented urine instead of modern sodium dithionite to dye woadindigo. Obviously you could sew the tabard by hand. Or by hand with eraaccurate method and width and length of stitches. Also instead of buying undyed woolen fabric you could weave your own wool. And of course you could spin your own woolen thread before weaving. Finally you could rebreed some extinct european sheep to get the eraappropriate wool.The bottom line is If you want equipment thats relatively speaking even halfway down the list of this example you wont be able to avoid a lot of heavy research on your part  more than strangers on Reddit can provide.Theres people spending a decade or more on getting this just rightStill If you can tell me a year a region and what kind of person I might be able to point you in the right direction. e.g. A knight England .,LARP,d7szf1y,3,t5_2rl8h

10193599,0,t1_dbzggq0,Think about RPG systems in general.  You get classes you get weapons you can wield you get a lot of spells possibly some armor.  Yet there is a huge difference between DnD. DnD . Fate and any Apocalypse system.As for the difference between it and Nero here are some of the bigger differences.Combat has smaller numbers.  Very rarely do players swing a value on every weapon swing so a weapon hitting you by default is one damage.  Called damage itself is usually low with  or  damage being common  being rare and  being very rare.  Additionally peoples hitpoint are low.  I dont play madrigal but I believe the starting HP for PCs are  with a way to easily increase that a little bit higher.  I believe also most people have a few points of armor that they can easily reset for free.Speaking of combat new players are able to interact with the world in the same manner as more experienced players.  With a few exceptions a new player can do anything that an experienced player can but do it less often and less varied.  A completely made up example would be a new player could swing  damage  times or  damage twice.  An experienced player could swing  damage twelve time  damage four times a combination of the two or call resist to fire once instead of a  damage call.  The new Player could have chosen the ability to learn resist but preferred to swing  damage instead.Headers are different from classes in that headers arent as restrictive.  For example there is no reason a person cant be a scholar as well as a spellcaster and an archer.  In addition rather than building up on each level headers just supply skills that can be purchased some of the skills will require prerequisites but they are more the exception than the rule.I believe the no touching policy is enforced as much as both participants are comfortable with which means even if you are comfortable being fully searchedcarried if the other person is not they can insist on the rules being followed.,LARP,dbzi10h,3,t5_2rl8h

I like it for a few purposes daggers flails and you can make bows out of it but aside from cost and availability it has almost nothing going for it.Pipe insulation is similar.  I like using it as a lightweight courtesy padding aka nonstriking surface but its rarely used in Dagorhir or Belegarth for striking surface.  I know good quality examples are still used in Amtgard in place of pool noodle which is mostly illegal nowadays and was going to link Warlord Sports the Amtgard gear supplier but I actually cant find it on their website anymore.From my experience in theater amp events gaffers tape seems like a good quality cloth tape.  If so I dont see how it would be free of the adhesive issues that duct tape can develop and while less of an issue still have to look out for on packing tape.  Its definitely a nice midway point between cloth and tape.  But I would like to ask why do you feel its aesthetically more appealing than cloth?

Latex and rubber will become porous over time and begin to tear the spray helps prevent that so when used on latex coated larp weapons it helps in making them look fresh for much longer. I give my arsenal a good rubbing down once before every event and sometimes in between when I think theyve been put under a lot of stress.Its also used as a lubricant so like uNoctiped said using it on your blade may reduce the friction in the scabbard.You can get it at any hardware store or buy it online. Its not all that expensive and I personally recommend it to any larper who plans on wielding a weapon in game.Edit Although I must say that I am not that familiar with pure foam weapons and applying the spray on them. All my stuff is latex coated.,LARP,ddrpaxk,2,t5_2rl8h
10789734,0,t1_ddssm7x,I was wondering about that. We use cardboard with leather or wood handles. A slab of bucket plastic behind the face layer of cb. Sprayglue to anchor and cloth over front. We edge them with blue camping foam and duct tape.,LARP,ddsvv5d,1,t5_2rl8h

10920073,0,t3_5vcvtp,Controlled contact meaning people can manhandle each other to a certain extent there are no touch zones for safetys sake. It takes a lot of trust and safe words help. But with a bit of practice players become more comfortable with it and with understanding how to modulate the intensity of a scene.Even slowed down scuffles or manhandling provide for so much more immersiveness. Im not a fan of boffer type stuff but mostly because of the mechanics that seem to accompany it get in the way of what I enjoy in a larp.I am also a fan of controlled discomfort be it sleep deprivation physical discomfort or a bit of hunger or tiredness. It makes things more interesting and realistic. ,LARP,de6bukr,1,t5_2rl8h

The scales are super well done!For the head I would look into making eyes like this  The basic recipe is to have two resin half orbs and just stick a drawingpaint the eyes on the flat side of the half spheres. You can always google resin eyes for other tutorialsideas.Eyes are extremely important when it comes to making costumes because its what humans notice the most.

11247711,0,t1_df6sfzv,Maybe jumping to full larps isnt the best step to be taking. Have you looked at Battle games? Dagorhir Belegarth Amtgard? By nature they are lighter on the role play although its still there and heavier on the combat.Instead of trying for full role play game one adapt concepts they already are aware of. They know capture the flag right? What about a milk run? Narratively if they are being sent on a milk run someone is doing the sending. Add some narrative and see if they pick up on it. Combining ideas from previous comments Milk run for an ammo crate. Thats a very motivating goal when ammo is limited.,LARP,df6wthc,1,t5_2rl8h
11501497,0,t1_dfzompe,Theyre pretty comfy my only complaint is that you cant really get away with using one for any kind of historical thing because the stitching on them is just a little too nice. The cotton has a really rough spunrustic look to it that doesnt come across in the pictures. They obviously arent super high quality pretty light weight and they wont last forever but theyre also  bucks and if you take care of them at least moderately well they will last a year or so of moderate use. They also only come in one size that Ive ever seen which they label as a large but I would call a US mens medium.  Ive also bought these before   Which suffer from a similar size issue.,LARP,dfzp0md,2,t5_2rl8h

11539725,0,t1_dg084sb,Just from what Ive read about it so far it sounds like DR is very very close to traditional medievalfantasy boffer LARPs in terms of rules organisation and playing style. Is this true? For example If I just switched around props and names for things to medievalish counterparts i.e.replace NERF gun with handheld crossbow replace psionics with magic replace science gone wrong zombies with dark magic zombies would the game also feel like a traditional fantasy game? In other words could it be seen as a reskin to borrow a term from computer games of a nonexisting fantasy game?Im curious because from my experience most genres that have been  popping up to go alongside the medievafantasymainstrem seem to be doing their own thing in many ways.,LARP,dg4134g,1,t5_2rl8h

11610298,0,t1_dgbl02z,The thing is A lot of us are trying to give our characters a believable even realistic looking appearence. Using authentic materials and sewing patterns that go back to a certain medieval time period and real armor is quite common in my area although its not needed or expected. Just paper and tape is an absolute nogo. But there are a lot of different larps out there so we might just not attend the same kind.Have you larped before? Where do you play?,LARP,dgc1cyi,6,t5_2rl8h
11636737,0,t1_dga3j6c,Store fronts and larps require different skillsets to run even though they can both be businesses.  For example in a larp you know you cant do everything yourself because you physically cant be in  places at once.  You have to delegate things out to other people.  For a smallish webstore you can try to do everything on your own and you may let things drop because of it.,LARP,dgf1ccw,1,t5_2rl8h
