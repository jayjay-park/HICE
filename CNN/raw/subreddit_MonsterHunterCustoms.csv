Also he cant be killed other than in the first wave of Speartip Crag and if his body despawnsvanishes the game crashes. Also if somebody steps on his walkable parts in a map other than S.Crag.,MonsterHunterCustoms,d1nyvy9,1,t5_39alg

10036292,0,t1_dbfpq65,Basic homebrew check your DS firmware version in the settings menu to see what you can use to actually activate it. Last I checked you could just use the browser to start off.  take out the SD card from your DS and copy everything to some folder on your PC to back it up.  download the latest homebrew starter pack.  copy and paste from that file directly into the SD card. Put back into the DS. use the homebrew activator you found in step one. Congrats. rdshacks to find the starter pack check what your firmware allows as an activator  entrypoint and just get a better guide. ,MonsterHunterCustoms,dbfr79u,1,t5_39alg
