5379820,0,t1_ctm7h0t,Yep just trying to wait until their show in my country I just cant wait  That way Ill get to know more people who listen to them. Not even one of my friends listen to LD and that band is not popular in Brazil so meeting new people is certainly a way of exchanging thoughts about bands and stuff in common,ladispute,cvzbzaz,1,t5_2tn5x

8266115,0,t3_4snunw,Yea its exactly what it says OP.Additionally I think it works to expand on the absurdity and nonsensical nature of what happens. These kids look up to this yo who not only is still extremely young but only barely older than everyone else in the group. When you take a step back its just another piece of the situation that doesnt make any sense at all.,ladispute,d5atlnb,9,t5_2tn5x

10841736,0,t3_5uudvy,I think you mean Jordans PIMO There are obvious candidates but some of the underappreciated ones in my mind are Bury Your Flame Nine  Sunday Morning at a Funeral and Why It Scares Me in no order. Writing on each is almost impeccable. I have long thought that Bury Your Flame was Jordans best. I listen to LD all day every day and Wildlife is my favorite album but BYF is just impeccably written and delivered! every time I look at it.  stands out for its structure. Shreds of disconnected thought delivered through short sentences delivered in conversational tone shifting to the magnificent emphasis on the stanza starting with Where I sat I saw brake lights flash in which longer sentences are employed to contrast with the narrators rapid perspective shifts. Delivery on I push my palms against the table hard to see if it hurt is unreal. Nine is just really simple and beautiful. Why It Scares Me is incredibly powerful. Sunday Morning is really interesting for its imagery and repetitive structure and how it links other songs together.Honorable mentions in rough order The Child We Lost  Safer In The Forest The Most Beautiful Bitter Fruit Edit Your Hometown The Surgeon and the Scientist yup I said it. I hate to say it because I think its popularity takes attention away from other songs but yes Andria is great poetry.In any case if I were to do a close readinganalysis of any of them Id bring Bury Your Flame or . Maybe Sunday Morning at a Funeral. Or Edit Your Hometown. Lots of room for analysis on those two. Nines a little short and theres not really that much to say about Why It Scares Me it kind of speaks for itself. ,ladispute,ddy8yfa,2,t5_2tn5x
