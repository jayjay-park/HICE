1048710,0,t3_23dw3x,In the developmental league I work for there is no penalty area for u teams. All fouls and infractions are punished with a direct free kick. Therefore a wall would be permissible and I would probably show them what to do as refereeing youngsters is largely instructional. The league follows modifications designed to develop fundamentals and keepers are introduced for u players. They play v and on a small field. Search on Modifications for youth players and youll get suggestions.,Referees,chnhr8v,1,t5_2sq2q

6839696,0,t3_49fjg3,Wow this sure sounds like a referee exam question so Im reluctant to answer it.  Like most exam questions you must only read whats on the page and add nothing.  You can get lost in the woods on some questions like this when you consider things such as did the player have permission of the referee?  Is this a smallsided youth match?  Is this a tournament competition with specific competition rules?The fact is Law  will have exactly what you seek.  Good luck.,Referees,d0rl0gk,2,t5_2sq2q

Almost all referees when I first got my grade  were also coaches but more and more kids are joining the ranks each year. Unfortunately more than half of them dont show up for more than one year  part due to taking some free time away but I believe its mostly due to the limited number of games available here in town so those wanting to officiate to make some money are only getting a few games per month.I now officiate high school games to pay for my sons select training each year. In addition to that I work a lot of tournaments and pick up the odd game that isnt covered and put it aside for tournament costs for my son so my wife has no reason to complain about the expense of him playing competitively for a club nearly an hour away. ,Referees,d4aykz1,1,t5_2sq2q
