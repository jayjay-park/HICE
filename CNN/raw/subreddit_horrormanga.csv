11704932,0,t1_dgmrjs9,I agree completely.   I loved it throughout.   I especially like how the brothers balloon picked the umbrella back up with the body as a sort of Yeah? Well fuck you! It was really great throughout.  I wonder couldnt balloons with bodies go ahead and be taken down as to clear up the skies a little bit or do you think there was just TOO much hysteria to try an plan something like that?  I guess it wouldnt have done much anyway.  Maybe you could trap a bodyless head under a net and keep the human alive?  Who knows.,horrormanga,dgmrwgk,1,t5_31po2
