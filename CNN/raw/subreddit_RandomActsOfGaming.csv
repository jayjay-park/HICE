His dad thought that was strange and asked why. The son said Dont worry about it Ill tell you when I graduate from high school. The next year he finished first grade and once again his dad was very proud of him. He was doing really well in math and spelling and he had lots of friends. Son said his dad You had a great year.

505434,0,t3_1zwjr2,I have  for you sir!First a funny tale about my experience with Terraria ..I have been playing many games lately. Most notably and often Terraria. I was out of it for a while but after the most recent update .. I am hooked again. I started a new world and exploring afresh. I discovered that you can now catch animals and put them in cages and keep them as pets so naturally I went on a Safari to Catch Em All! I have cought  of the total  you can catch. I have my favourite pet penguin Pingu. And my second favourite is a Mallard Duck named Geoff. Geoff likes to quack nonstop and I was seriously considering letting him go free at one point. After an emotional and slightly passionate stare off I decided I love Geoff too much to let him go and just put him in the basement instead. After that I discovered that Pingu was actually quite hungry so I went on another adventure to catch him some fish to eat. After spending a good while catching fish I fed Pingu and he layed an egg. Surprising considering I thought male penguins couldnt lay eggs!? I raised the baby penguin like it was my own and continued to name it Georgie. Georgie is a cute one if not a little demanding. Anyway after all that trouble penguin birth is gross I continued to build my new base. Then the merchant moved in! I cant remember his name but boy are his prices high! I payed  gold for a simple mining helmet! What a ripoff! After getting my helmet I explored a bit and mined a metric crapton of silt. I extractinated it and what dropped was my new loyal follower pet Pedro! He is a TRex. He is very nice and doesnt even bite as you would expect a TRex to. I would recommend this game to anyone who wants an animal raisingpokemon simulator. I enjoy raising Geoff and Pingu and Georgie and having Pedro as a loyal companion! Also the rest of the game is pretty good too! Story  The story of my lifeOkay heres the story of my life.One day long long ago a great thing was born. This thing was neither human nor alien but something greater. This thing that was born was a thing! Now this thing would grow up to do great things it just didnt know it yet. The first words it said were I want to be a pirate! little did it know the golden age of piracy was long past. At the age of  this thing won its first science fair with a potato battery that powered a baking sodavinegar volcano which erupted golden ducks. Next at age  this thing created the most beautiful thing ever to exist on this planet or any other Bacon. The bacon it invented was so delicious and fatty and greasy and golden red in colour that no mere mortal could eat it. He took it to the high council of god truckers who everyone knows are the only gods worthy enough of such a magical meat. They ate this most magical of gifts and immediately all of them erupted into infinite piles of gold. They reformed and gave this gold the thing and elected him as their new godliest god of all gods. Then at age  this thing did something even more significant it created Candy chocolate covered sprinkled bacon. He then sold this bacon to mere mortals for money to fund his future project a time machine. As you already know the mortals were not worthy of the bacon and as soon as they touched it it burned their hands. It was thought to be hotter than ghost peppers by  times. After selling  worth of this bacon the thing built a time machine and travelled back to the year  to become a pirate. He succesfully pirated millions of dollars worth of goods from the British Empire until they finally captured him and exiled him to Australia. While there he built a fabulous marble palace and discovered the only true fact known to man kangaroos can jump higher than the average house. This fact was written in almost every religious scripture and scroll in history and to this day remains the only true fact ever period. The thing as you must know by now was actually the great joshkerky and this tale has been told many times and carried down through the generations since his discovery in . Now he would like to thank the OP of this giveaway. I hope this fact has been very insightful for you and my story made you laugh.Thanks OP if you didnt read all that you should. Thanks for this giveaway. I would love to play Borderlands  as I have put many hours into the original but am short on cash. Oh and I hope my story made you laugh!

764312,0,t3_22w4l3,My girlfriend and I bought an Xbox one at release as our first joint purchase after moving into our first apartment together. But our TV died only hours before we picked it up. To top it off a job I had lined up didnt come through which put us in a really weird spot for a few months.We were both bummed and worked really hard to get another TV and it just arrived! Because of this cost we havent been able to even get a single game or second controller for the Xbox. Until we can actually do this it sits in our closet collecting dust. Here is a photo or two. Its such a bummer but what can you do!It would also be great to play with my siblings from back home!Good luck to all and congrats to the winner!,RandomActsOfGaming,cgr5p3p,0,t5_2t5mo

The first man says Well I was searching my apartment for the asshole my wife was cheating on me with and I found him hanging outside my window. So I pushed him off and threw my refrigerator down for good measure. Then I had a heart attack and died. The second guy says I was painting some guys house when my harness snapped and I caught myself hanging on a window sill. Then some lunatic started screaming at me and pushed me off which was fine until he threw down his fridge and crushed me with it. The third man slyly says Well I hiding in this schmucks refrigerator... ,RandomActsOfGaming,ch3t0jb,1,t5_2t5mo

1010098,0,t3_25nkdk,My best gaming story would have to be playing Little Big Planet with my brother and two cousins. Its such a fun game to play with  other people. Im the oldest and my cousins are younger than me yet this game was the best time weve ever had all four of us together.We went through almost every single level together of both LBP abs LBP especially the mini levels if LBP. The first time we figured out you could smack people shit went down. Many times wed just stop trying to beat the level so that we could have an impromptu smack battle. So there are the four of us jumping and running around smacking each other in the face sometimes smacking more than  of us at a time. We would be laughing historically. My youngest cousin would sometimes laugh so hard he would start tearing up.Our parents were upstairs and they told us later that they never heard us laugh like that and have so much fun together. They were kind of astounded.Those are probably the best memories I have with them. Ill never forget it.Anyways thanks for the giveaway.,RandomActsOfGaming,chj3te7,2,t5_2t5mo

Astronomically speaking it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically it tells me that Saturn is in Leo.

But then a friend of mine bought me Borderlands because he knew I LOVED RPGs and knew I disliked FPS but he didnt. He also got a copy so we could play it together and I absolutely loved it especially the race too find loot and steal it right in front of their eyes A year or so later Borderlands  came out and it got amazing reviews and I managed to play it on my friends laptop for a bit and it looked utterly BADASS.So I hope this ample information to why I would love to play Borderlands  especially when the third is coming.,RandomActsOfGaming,ciboyf1,1,t5_2t5mo

1279719,0,t3_28qmqn,If you want the best stories ever told I suggest watching the original series twilight zone.Some are funny some are serious some are scary heartwarming sad whatever you like.But I think ill tell a story from my life a true one from my perspective.Around a year ago I met this woman.  She seemed nice enough and we got along well.  A few days into knowing her I find out that she has depression among other issues it may sound odd that she would tell me that after only a few days but people tell me stuff all the time.  I can be standing at a bus stop and people will literally tell me their lifes stories annoying but not uncommon.  A few months later and she has started cutting.  It turned out that her ex boyfriend himself an abuser on top of all else had at one point raped her.  She hadnt even realized until discussing it with me when she told me that she had said no but he went ahead and did it anyway.  She blamed herself partially because she still dated him afterwards and felt no one would believe her that it was indeed rape.Among all this I was trying to help her maybe date her as well but dating was always put out by her liking this friend of hers who was literally just out to use her for sex and she knew this but still wanted to date him regardless.  so I truged along trying to help because I always try to help.Over the course of the year her and I did date a little off and on though always the moment that other guy would step back into her life it would fall apart.Then one day she decided I shouldnt be a part of her life anymore which is probably for the best.  For whatever reason tensions were high and we were bickering a lot apparently.Upon reflection Im both sad an a little happy that its over.  No more staying up til  in the morning trying to keep her from cutting herself no more feeling like im just being used for emotional support. Anyway thats my story.  If I win Ill pick a game then no sense in doing it now in case it goes over five before the giveaway ends.Thanks for the chance.,RandomActsOfGaming,cidl33y,1,t5_2t5mo

1327154,0,t1_ciijzvo,That is actually a common question.  Id rephrase the question though around the concepts that RAM is volatile and when rebooting you loose all the data.But Dimmdrive specifically has a feature that syncs up your ramdisk to your normal hard drive in realtime for any files that changes.  Also on top of that Dimmdrive has layers of protection built in should your PC suddenly power out or such.So yea Ive got that covered and it works like a champ ,RandomActsOfGaming,ciix75h,1,t5_2t5mo

3696386,0,t3_32jujp,Let me tell you the story of Yuri the Russian Diver. You see Yuri hes this middleaged Russian worker. Hard worker but he has to be growing up in the poor neighbourhoods of Moscow. Doesnt like violence so he doesnt join the army and the only thing hes really good at is physical labour. Poor Yuris daily routine was basically to get out of bed in his cramped dirty little bachelor apartment really just a hole in the wall then walk to work through muddy streets in the summer slushy streets in the winter and break his back for ten hours a day to get paid thirty rubles a month. Every day when he comes home he falls asleep with the mantra in his head Yuri its okay. Everyone has a difficult life here and you are used to it. You are used to these hardships. Dont let them bother you. And every day hed wake up and do it all over again. But one day as he was walking home from the quarry he sees this huge billboard on the side of a building that had just been put up. Rise of capitalism and all that jazz. On the billboard is a beautiful Russian woman in a bathingsuit posing and flashing her pretty teeth. Under the woman is the address to the local gymnasium and the phrase LEARN TO SWIM! TEN RUBLES! So naturally Yuri is a bit hesitant. Thats a third of his monthly earnings but he sees the pretty girl on the advertisement and starts thinking Yuri! Look at that! Maybe if you go to the pool and learn to swim you could meet a beautiful woman like that! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesnt have to be so dull! So Yuri convinces himself to go. He saves up a bit of money and sure enough a week later he is at the gym and he slaps down the ten rubles to learn to swim. Now while he didnt meet any beautiful women there because mostly it was just lonely guys who responded to the ad he decided not to let that ruin the investment and he took to swimming with his entire being. His Russian work ethic made him excel in all his classes and soon he had learned the front stroke the back stroke and was swimming laps like an Olympic hopeful. For a time he was very happy but slowly he realized he would not meet any beautiful women at the pool and he was not learning anything else from the novice instructors. So he goes back to his usual life of hardships working at the quarry and only goes to the pool once in a while when he has a day off to keep up his swimming. But then one day as he is returning from work...he sees that the billboard has changed. LEARN TO DIVE! TWENTY RUBLES! With the sexy Russian woman now in a twopiece suit nonetheless. So once again Yuri says Yuri! Look at that! Maybe if you learn to dive you could finally meet that beautiful woman and at the very least swimming will be exciting again! Maybe this life of hardships and toil doesnt have to be so dull! Naturally twenty rubles takes him a while to save up. He suffers incredible hardships eating only the cheapest food. He doesnt pay his electricity bill for a month and ends up spending many nights cold and shivering in addition to the usual hardships. However it lasts only a few weeks and he has easily saved his rubles. Goes down to the gym and plunks down the money informing the cashier that he intends to learn to dive! So he puts all his effort into learning to dive.Learns the halfgainer fullgainer backflips swandives... Mastered it all in less than a week. Our man Yuri was making highdives at the end of the month that would have put him on the jet to Olympia. Still it wasnt enough to completely remove him from the hardships of reality. There were a few women in the class but they were all future hopefuls that were ten or twelve years old. Yuri never met the hot woman from the billboard but soon he was the best in his class...nay...in Russia! So he became dejected again with the fact that he could not learn anything more and started picking up overtime at the quarry instead of going to the pool. This only made him more miserable and soon he had accepted that his life of hardships was not going to get any better. Then one day he sees a new billboard up on the building as hes coming home from work. This one has a beautiful American woman on it smiling and waving in front of the Statue of Liberty. Under the picture is COME TO AMERICA! FIFTY RUBLES! Yuri sighs and convinces himself to keep walking. But the next day and the next day he sees that sign and that promise of a new life in America and he gets to thinking Yuri! What are you doing here? You are the best swimmer in all of Russia and yet you wallow in your life of hardships! You are the best diver in all of Russia and yet you go every day to your depressing job! Yuri maybe if you go to America you can leave your life of tiring work and hardships behind and finally meet some nice women! YES! Yuri dont you see? This is a sign! So Yuri begins to save up all his money. He eats nothing but the poorest food and even starts going to the homeless soup kitchen to make sure he is strong enough to keep working all the overtime he is pulling in. He sells all his worldly possessions minus a few sets of clothes and his bathing suit. Finally after suffering incredible hardships  long exhausting days and nearsleepless shivering nights for an entire month  he is able to finally sell his little apartment and scrape together the fifty rubles plus food for the twoweeklong trip by steamer. Yuri the Greatest Swimmer and Diver in all of Russia walks down to the harbour finds the ticket counter and plops down the fifty rubles saying to the lady Take me to America! I am leaving this life of hardship behind! Now Yuri gets on the boat and they leave the port heading West that very afternoon. It is a fine sturdy boat so his fears are lessened right away and there are many other passengers who are like him and who have even heard of Yuris excellent skill at diving so he has lots of people to talk to. In fact hes almost a celebrity on board. But with nothing to do but stare out the windows or wander around on the deck everyone starts to get restless and bored. Yuri gets tired of talking about diving with everyone so he basically just sits in his cabin room and does nothing. But of course Yuri is used to hardships and manages to keep himself busy by imagining all the things he can do once he gets to America. In fact one day about halfway though the trip he starts to figure out he could open up a swimming school and this makes him very excited. Before he can start drawing out plans however...BOOM! The boat slowly comes to a stop in the middle of the ocean and the captain comes onto the intercom. He says that one of the engines broke down and it will be at least three hours before they will be moving again. This makes all the bored people even more antsy and Yuri hears many people grumbling and mad and complaining as he walks around that day. Suddenly he comes up with an idea! He says to himself Yuri you are the best Swimmer in all of Russia are you not? You are the best Diver in all of Russia too! Why not use this time to enjoy the ocean and go for a dive? Surely the Captain wouldnt mind! And sure enough word that an expert diver putting on a show circulates around the boat and the captain agrees hoping it will entertain and calm the passengers as the repairs finish. The water is tranquil and beautiful. The air is warm and there have been no signs of sharks or danger for miles and miles. So confident it is safe Yuri finally runs to his cabin and changes into his bathing suit. He even looks at the clock to make sure he waited an hour after breakfast before swimming. When he comes up onto deck most of the ship is there to watch. Everyone is excited and whispering hes Yuri! The best Diver in all of Russia! This will be quite a show! Yuri well he is filled with happiness and confidence so he declares to the crowd I will attempt my highest dive ever from the top of the crows nest! So he climbs up the ladder to the crows nest high above the deck. It takes him a few minutes to get up there but by the time he has finished climbing everyone is excited and even the crew is watching. So without wanting to wait too long Yuri stretches readies himself and even checks the air with a lick of his finger. Yuri takes a few steps back on the crows nest then runs and leaps into the air! Two back flips! Then a corkscrew! Then a front flip! Then...BAM! Yuri missed the edge of the boat and accidentally hit the metal deck! And everyone is sure hes hurt or dead but as everyone comes running up to him shouting Yuri! Yuri! Are you alright!?! Yuri! Are you hurt? Yuri!!! he gets up rubbing his head painfully. Then he turns to the surprised audience and says Its okay. Im alright. Im used to hardships,RandomActsOfGaming,cqdm2eg,2,t5_2t5mo

4702095,0,t3_3f9zu6,I do not want Star Ruler.I like space a lot and think it is the coolest thing known to man but I think the craziest thing about space is how big it is. We dont know where it ends or if it ends and I think that is something crazy that humans simply cannot comprehend. If it goes on forever or if it just stops both ways dont make sense to me. We humans always think that there has to be a start and a finish. There are so many galaxies and planets out there and we have only just scratched the surface of something that is so incredibly great. I love just looking up at night and seeing the stars and thinking to myself that we are living on a planet that is just floating in nothing. But at the same time it is really scary. We dont know what is out there. There could be terrible creatures or nothing at all and I think if we are here all alone in this entire galaxy which I dont think we are that is absolutely terrifying and it makes me have so many more questions. Why are we here and what is the point? Space is so big and it is absolutely crazy if you look into it but us being so alone in this space that we have no idea how big is is crazy and it fascinates me so much. Here are two links that really show the size of space and how crazy everything is. It is truely mindblowing The gif is showing the mass of a supermassive black hole measured in suns.Thanks for doing this giveaway!,RandomActsOfGaming,ctn8joo,1,t5_2t5mo

People within these regions where the prices are lower can only send games to people within the same region Latin Americans can send the games to other Latin Americans but not to Canadians or Russians for example due to these lower prices as a way to stop people other regions to just having people buy games for them where its at a lower price.The problem is that the Latin America region is made up of most if not all Latin American countries but basically only Brazil has games at a cheaper price.

5667141,0,t3_3sjlu0,My parents put Grandma Rosie in a home when she started to lose her grasp on reality they said. I still found it cruel. But she seemed content. Content enough I guess.I remember visiting her. She had an old wooden rocking chair that faced the window. Outside was nothing but flat fields of green. The green would eventually fade and when it snowed it was carpets of white for miles and miles. Im not sure which season Grandma Rosie liked the most. She didnt do a lot of talking. She mainly listened to her radio and always one station ..But . never had a signal. It was always static. Grandma Rosie listened to this static all day seemingly waiting out her life. No one could reach her.I visited one day to drop off a box of chocolates. Grandma Rosie rocked slowly in her chair with large headphones over her ears staring out the window watching the snowfall. I couldnt tell if she knew I was there. I walked over and placed the chocolates on a small table and her hand suddenly reached across and snatched my wrist.Shhh she whispered. Listen.Grandma Rosie leaned in close and I put my ear to hers. I lifted up the cup of her headphone and listened. There was only static.I was about to speak but she covered my mouth with her hand.Listen closer she said.I did but all I heard was more static.Soon they will come she said. They will come to take me away.This freaked me out a little and I went home. I told my mom and dad about what happened but they didnt think it was that weird.I kept thinking about it. One night I couldnt sleep so I buzzed my friend Abby on our walkie talkies. She lived across the street and she somehow she knew all about .. She told me it was an old legend in our town and you needed two things to explore the legend further a radio and a closet with the door slightly open. Face away from the closet tune in to . and listen very closely. At some point through the static youll hear the faint sounds of an organ distant screams and the dragging of metal chains along a gravelly surface. The open doorway is an invitation  keep your eyes closed and only if you keep your eyes closed  a figure will appear and drag you into the closet. From there your fate is unknown.How do you know this? I asked.Ive heard about it she said. Dont tell anyone. The less people that know the better. I looked out my window and saw Abby in her bedroom. She put her finger up to her lips.This is our secret the walkie talkie buzzed.For the next few days I kept thinking about the ritual and Grandma Rosie. Why would she be playing this game? Why did she want to be dragged into an unknown fate?I again told my parents that I was worried about Grandma Rosie. They were very dismissive.Ever since Grandpa died I think she wants to let go my mom said. She wants to be with him.I wanted to know more so I decided to try the game myself. It was late at night and I opened my closet door just a crack. I sat on my bed with my back to the closet tuned my radio to . and put on my headphones. I heard the static and I closed my eyes.I sat there for a long time focusing very hard on the static. The longer I sat there the more it felt like my room was shrinking. Kind of like the space was filling up with something else like I wasnt alone.In my headphones I heard the distant organ and I heard the screams that seemed far away but sounded like they were getting closer. The screeching of the metal began and then I heard a voiceOPEN YOUR EYES!I jumped from my bed very startled. Abby was laughing hysterically through the walkietalkie. I looked around my bedroom. I was alone. I looked out the window and saw Abby smiling and giggling. She brought the walkie talkie up to her mouth.I totally scared you! she said. Theres no one there! Youre such a wuss.I noticed the closet door. It was wide open. The static of . hissed from my headphones.I was only joking the walkie talkie chirped. But I wasnt so sure it was a joke.Grandma Rosie died two weeks later in her sleep. Her time had come. And I was done fooling around with legends and superstitions.Thanksi will like any of this CIvilization V HotlineMiami or Tropico even FTL is cool,RandomActsOfGaming,cwzkbr1,1,t5_2t5mo

Entering to win a game just to sell it not only goes against the entire spirt of this sub as well as just being a dick move.

This is my favorite recipe for them.    cups allpurpose flour   teaspoon baking soda   teaspoon fine salt    sticks  tablespoons unsalted butter at room  temperature   cup packed light brown sugar   cup granulated sugar   large eggs   teaspoon pure vanilla extract  One ounce bag semisweet chocolate chips Position oven racks in the top and bottom thirds of the oven and preheat to  degrees F. Line  baking sheets with parchment.Whisk together the flour baking soda and salt in a large bowl. Beat the butter and both sugars with an electric mixer on mediumhigh speed in a second large bowl until light and fluffy about  minutes. Add the eggs to the butter mixture one at time beating after each addition to incorporate beat in the vanilla. Reduce the speed to medium add the flour mixture and beat until just incorporated. Stir in the chocolate chips.Scoop  heaping tablespoons of dough onto each prepared baking sheet about  inches apart. Roll each into a ball with slightly wet hands. Bake until the cookies are golden but still soft in the center  to  minutes rotating the baking sheets halfway through. Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the baking sheets then transfer them to a rack to cool completely.This is a heartwarming comforting and delicious food to make your night. or anytime for that matter Thanks OP!!!

6458793,0,t3_4415ia,Hi!I live in South Africa. Our currency is really weak compared to the rest of the western world which keeps me from buying games often. The last game I bought was  months premium time for Warthunder at the start of last year. Since then I havent really had enough extra money lying around to be able to purchase anything.There are more than enough FP games around for that not to bother me too much and as an alternative I could always pirate the games but I dont really like doing that  the last pirated game I had was CoD Modern Warfare.Id love to play Cities Call of Juarez and Far Cry but probably wont be able to afford them this year or at least until June. I understand that you want to give them away in a bundle but if you change your mind I wouldnt appreciate getting even  of these games!,RandomActsOfGaming,cznds0f,1,t5_2t5mo

6467504,0,t3_447fvz,So a little over a year ago me and my buddies went to go check out this traveling carnival that comes into town every year. Weve never gone before and figured why not just to see how it is. We planned to go on the weekend and the semester had just started up. There was this super cute girl in my American History class that I mustered the courage to talk to and ask if shed ever been to the carnival. She hadnt so I asked if she wanted to come with us. She said sure.So Saturday rolls around and we all meet up there. Me and my buddies carpooled and she drove separately and met us there. So we are walking around playing some games the ones that arent an obvious scam and you actually have a chance to win and having a good time. I didnt want to go on any of the rickety rides because I didnt trust them. And I didnt want to be this guyWell my buddies and I were already hanging out that morning playing video games and we stopped at a Eleven on the way to the carnival and picked up some large Slurpees. Needless to say I needed to use the restroom. So I scoped out a pavilion that was across the field that was basically like the bathrooms you see at the pool. One half for guys and the other for girls. As I got closer there was a gigantic line just to get IN to the bathroom! So I got it line then started doing the math. I estimated how long it takes people to come out and how many people were in front of me. I couldnt hold it it was going to take too long.So I start looking around and they were renovating the park or doing some construction about  yds away and I scoped out a blue portapotty in the distance. It was a weekend so no one was working and it was far enough away from the carnival that I knew no one would be there. I jogged over knocked on the door to the portapotty no one answered. I opened the door and looked down and it was sooooo disgusting. There was a mountain of turd in the hole at the bottom with a sea of yellow around it. The small was heinous. I had no other choice. I opened my fly and went number . But then I figured since I was here Ill just drop the kids off at the pool number  because I will have to soon anyway. Dont worry I wasnt going to AC Slater it. I coudnt even if I tried. There wasnt enough room from the back of the toilet to the wall my knees would hit the back. So I turned around layed down at least  feet of TP all over the seat and popped a squat.Then all of a sudden someone starts banging on the side of the portapotty yelling for me to get out and that they need to use it. I start panicking as I am already mid poop past the point of no return. Then someone else starts banging on the portapotty from the other side yelling at me to get out. I heard snickering in the background and figured out it was my buddies. Im still sitting on the throne and they start tilting the potty back and forth. I have my hands on the sides trying to keep myself from falling over and I am yelling at them to Fampamp STOP! I can hear the past turds and piss sloshing around underneath me. Of course they dont listen and they see how far they can tilt it. I yell some more and they finally stop but it got a little too quiet. I continue my poop.Then all of a sudden a feel a huge thump comes from the back and the entire portapotty begins to tip over. Turns out one of my friends decided to dropkick the potty like he was on WWE or something. There I am with my pants down mid poop at a  degree angle now as the potty is tipping over. I brace for impact and my whole body slams against the front door which is now face down. I CANT GET OUT! I also got splashed with peepoop on impact. My next thought was omg that mountain of turd is going to leak out more. I stand up crouched and sideways in this stupid portapotty and start feeling the pee cover my feet I had flip fliops on. I look back and that gigantic turd mountain is slowly making its way out. I start yelling at my buddies to tilt it back up. TILT IT BACK UP NOWWW!!!! They do but its too late. I have pee and poop from about  randos all over my feet and legs.As soon as its upright I kick the door open and dont even have time to give my friends the business. I just start sprinting towards my car. The straps on my flip flops break through the sole and everyone just sees this weird dude with brown stains on his shorts and legs running across the field and carnival barefoot with his flip flops flapping behind him as he runs. I get in my car hear a sqoosh sound as I sit down. Just realized I never wiped myself after number . Turn the car on and drive home. Took an hour long shower. Then I realized the girl was still at the carnival shes going to think I flaked out or something. What are my idiot friends going to tell her?Called my buddies and they told her I had an asthma attack but left my inhaler at home. I dont have asthma. At least they partially made up for it.Went out to my car and there is a small residual turd on the drivers seat the floor mat is wet. I got those big yellow cleaning gloves and basically used a whole bottle of Febreze to clean that samp off literally.The girl is the same girl whose house I was AC Slatering at. I rememered the story because last week we saw a commercial for an inhaler and she says to me Have you had any problems with your asthma since? I say no its VERY mild and kind of chuckled.Maybe one day Ill tell her. I still drive the same car and I can still smell poo in the drivers seat but maybe its my memory.,RandomActsOfGaming,czoaakp,1,t5_2t5mo

8399784,0,t3_4unygn,My wife came home from the mall with a surprise for me one night way back in the day.  It was bunch of   inch floppies.  She said I bought you a game!  Apparently a few guys had set up a kiosk in the mall and were selling DOOM.  Of course I had heard of it already but my dialup internet kept crapping out downloading the massive MB install file so I was unable to get it.I fired it up and it was AMAZING.  I loved it and was excited to get to play the second and third episodes.  But the guys were massive scammers...they sold my wife the shareware version not the full thing.  Of course they were long gone by the time I realized it.Ended up buying DOOM  on CDROM because I only had a MB hard drive.  I needed to install and reinstall the two games I was playing at the time because there wasnt room for both.  DOOM and TIE Fighter traded spots on that hard drive for a few months until I spent  on a new MB hard drive.Good memories of great games.,RandomActsOfGaming,d5ripm1,2,t5_2t5mo

ThanksI would like Tales from the Borderlands and either Sanctum  or Brtal LegendAs for a fond gaming memoryBack when smash for the n was all the craze my friend and I would get togheter on sundays to play all day. One of those days Myself and a friend choosed Captain falcon while another friend choosed Jigglypuff. While Jigglypuff somehow ended between a pair of falcon punch that collapsed to each other.I had never seen a player sent flying away as fast a Jigglypuff was.A more recent one my brother and me where playing smash on the DS. I was using Captain Falcon surprise! and him was using link. Well he launched his boomerang and I evaded but on the comeback I was trapped. I tried to press jump but instead I pressed Special. Well by the momment the boomerang was close to my brother my falcon punch executed sending Link off the screen and giving me the match. Man I almost pissed my self from the laughter!,RandomActsOfGaming,d5wgkcf,2,t5_2t5mo

10317055,0,t3_5npenq,I remember the first time I played HalfLife  on PC when I had only played it on the OG Xbox before that. I was blown away by how extremely good the game looked compared to the Xbox port and I was even more blown away by the easy of use and accuracy of using a mouse. It was my first FPS for PC.. I was never the same again. After beating HalfLife  for a second time on PC I finally realized what made PC Gaming so great and although I returned home to Nintendo consoles from time to time I could never play a console game the same again. Now HL is one of my favorite games of all time and it led to so much love and happiness with PC gaming that I never would have wanted or experienced otherwise.Thanks for the trip down memory lane OP. Its been fun.,RandomActsOfGaming,dcdhss8,1,t5_2t5mo
10318333,0,t3_5npenq,This happened like  years ago in the second year of my university in Turkey. After I came to the University I hadnt had the most fun I was studying for an exchange opportunity and all. After some point I had realized my GPA was good enought and I cannot fuck it up. So I decided to join Gaming Club in my university. One or two days after I joined I came across one of the most beautiful people I have ever met Gurkan. He is still my best friend and we are living together he is doing gaming tracks now and has some small soundcloud we are reading books in Turkish.Heres how we metWe bought an old TV Atari and some old Atari cassettes. We were trying to figure it out how to do it old way. We somewhat figured out and started playing one by one. Then this guy Gurkan came to the club. We greeeted and met each other. I was waiting for my turn to play some Space Invaders all of a sudden this guy grabbed the console and opened Space Invaders. Everybody was complaning and he just didnt give any fucks. And I asked if I can come in and play together. Heres the thing. I am very passionate about Space Invaders it used to our daily chores with my dad he was working in Turkish consulate in Iraq when we were there he was busy all the time yet he used to manage to spare time to play Space Invaders with me. So we started playing and it lasted like hours he was so good at it. We were beating each others scores one by one. Later on thanks to him I won a free pizza when I was visiting Yosemite just with beating the high record on Space Invader. That day was amazing. And we were sitting talking together all the time and playing Space Invaders when we want. We became best friends played bunch of games together including WoW Dead by Daylight Hots LoL Hearthstone. Now he is so into Diablo that I cannot offer any other game. I wanted to play that also yet I have monetary issues atm. So this was my story. Thanks.,RandomActsOfGaming,dcdn0ie,1,t5_2t5mo

The other watches your snatch.A man kills a deer and takes it home to cook for dinner. Both he and his wife decide that they wont tell the kids what kind of meat it is but will give them a clue and let them guess.Of course the kids are eager to know what the meat is.

11444308,0,t3_63ce34,Ha! Fandom.  Try life style.  But of a wee boo when it come to One Piece.  I have rewatched the series every couple of months.  Reread them every so often when I have a free chance.  In one way Luffy and the other straw hats have shaped my view of the world and defined my moral code. Friends come first.  Standing up and doing what is kind not just want is right.  Letting my actions define myself rather than the belief of others defining me. As to the creator of the shape Oda.  It is the longest single running show in anime history and Oda has had a plan for the entire series.  He has always known what is going to happen next were the straw hats would end up and when they would conquer or be crushed. Oda has also been resistant to producers companies and third parties from coming in and changing the showmanga because that has been the downfall of so many others. As for the show itself where can I start... It is the only show to have made me cry.  Literally ball my eyes out both in joy and sadness. I held it together for the futurama episode of frys dog but I broke down to one piece.  When the team rescues Robin from Enies Lobby and she screams that she wants to live... I am tearing up and getting child as I write about it.  It was such an incredible moment in the showmanga that have so much credence to Luffys dedication to his friends and comrades.  More so then when he saved Nami and her island from the fishman pirates or when the crew liberated the nation of alabaster.  Id say that Robins rescue was more significant than Aces death at least in my vision of Luffy.  Actually writing this out I know deep down that it is time for me to reread the manga. I am long overdo and I have been burning myself out.  I need the reminder of the joy.  ,RandomActsOfGaming,dft7a8n,1,t5_2t5mo
