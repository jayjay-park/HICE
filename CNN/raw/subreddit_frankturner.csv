4727798,0,t3_3fohnk,Very different to the acoustic version. But I really like it! Definitely more of a positive song than I thought it would be...,frankturner,ctqh9na,9,t5_2s76h
4751869,0,t3_3fwsgj,I think for me that this album is arriving at a pivotal time in my life. Crucial AS results are metaphorically round the corner which will act as a bookend for what has been a difficult year. A year in which i have struggled with my own demons. Yes some of the lyrics on the record do seem a little cliche. But at this time in my life I need a little cliche. I think this record will speak to a lot of people on a rather deep level as it has clearly done to the man himself. ,frankturner,cttinnd,2,t5_2s76h

5524646,0,t3_3qqeju,I loved it! I was about three people back from the stage dead center. I grabbed me some Frank butt when he was crowd surfing and helped support him on the rail before he jumped in.Felt a little bad about Skinny Listers bassist nearly but not quite hitting the floor with his upright while he was surfing.,frankturner,cwhtn91,2,t5_2s76h
7265639,0,t1_d241439,He was quite open about his past use of powder in his book. Why do you think he is still using? ,frankturner,d241vwi,1,t5_2s76h
9145992,0,t1_d892rdu,Im sticking with the DIY version. I added a FTHC and had Frank sign it after the show in St. Louis.,frankturner,d8bbji1,1,t5_2s76h
9595270,0,t3_5c9m38,I dont really have an interesting story lol. My boyfriend has known and loved Frank Turner for a couple of years now and introduced me to his music when we got to know each other about a year and a half ago and I was hooked right away. I have been lucky enough and managed to get a ticket to a small show only  tickets! at the Backstage Hotel in Amsterdam and I went to two more shows after that yay. Afterwards Frank hung out for a bit to talk to everyone really took his time. We waited patiently and I was so damn nervous lol. He was so incredibly kind and we hugged and got a picture together. Not a special story but for me it was really special. The guys amazing. ,frankturner,d9vta63,2,t5_2s76h
