606885,0,t1_cg8v3im,Except Im not questioning the many worlds interpretation. My problem is with how the timeline collapses by exploding. If it affects the entire universe then that would also mean timelines would collapse if time travel occurs anywhere in the universe.In fact the many worlds interpretation doesnt say anything about different realities disappearing or collapsing. The obvious problem with universes disappearing with decisions is that any universe can wink out of existence at any time.,TheContinuum,cg997wy,1,t5_2u6ch

680226,0,t1_cghjiz1,Its certainly not impossible given what they have shown to create a similar or even the exact same timeline as the one she left.However Im still of the opinion that all of the events which take place are part of the same timeline they left from.

743342,0,t3_22mvoz,Kellog for sure.Since the start of the show with perhaps a couple of episodes where he was a major player he just pops in as a tool to push another character in a direction of his choosing. For someone with intimate knowledge of the future and the means and will to exploit that he sure isnt doing a great deal that we know of.,TheContinuum,cgoruc8,6,t5_2u6ch
745326,0,t1_cgoradd,So they didnt rate it because they knew before it even aired that it was going to get a bad rating before the ratings came out? So reviewers in the USA have their own time travel devices. That sure is an interesting theory.,TheContinuum,cgp00c8,2,t5_2u6ch
774958,0,t3_22obq9,Yeah last season I was convinced she was a time traveller with some sort of mod that altered her either tech or genetic to be awesome.

1615975,0,t3_2cq7zg,I dont think you missed anything.  The whole presentation was really confusing.  Chens resurrection first as a hallucination and then presence as a freelancer and then betrayal and presumable slaying of Keira...it was all really poorly executed.  To me it seemed like twists just for the sake of twists almost like the writers were forced to use the Chen character and struggled to find ways to include him.  Doesnt anyone on this show die and stay dead?  I wonder how long until Betty comes back!,TheContinuum,cjiuzfb,2,t5_2u6ch

3689268,0,t3_32lfec,Kiera is the best platform through which to set the story imo. Its not a police procedural! The entire setting is a compelling dichotomy between a band of terrorists whose cause seems just but whose methods are appalling vs a moral cop attempting to operate within an inherently unjust system that she was programmed to believe in. Through Keiras eyes we see her and other characters wake up to this reality. Nothing is black and white. Its all very nuanced and complicated shades of gray. I think thats one of this things Simon Barry was attempting to convey with this show and I think Continuum does a tremendous job of doing that.,TheContinuum,cqcsujc,8,t5_2u6ch

6217487,0,t1_cyw04aa,Kellogg has the word opportunist tattooed on his forehead.

The others in the group then begin collecting the ingredients available in that time which includes a special chromosome found from certain people. During this time some of the members doubt that Travis can make it and Curtis Chen seems interested in taking charge of the group when he dies despite the fact that Sonya is next in line. Eventually the group gathers enough to synthesize serums that could last indefinitely and Travis recovers. ,TheContinuum,d2l2m1h,3,t5_2u6ch
