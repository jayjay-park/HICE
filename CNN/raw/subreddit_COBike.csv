The line was supposed to extend to at least th and wadsworth with a station at church ranch or nd and Sheridan. That extension is almost pointless and certainly doesnt serve the population  of Westminster. ,COBike,cll3hsi,2,t5_2sfnd

9314336,0,t3_57yev7,Ive done this route and its a fun ride. Part paved part well maintained gravel paths not much time on highway you can ride down HWY  which has sections with little to no shoulder on a highly traveled highway.Start point Cherry Creek SP. CCSP to Castle Rock Castle Rock also has a very nice paved trail thru the city that will connect you to the HWY  south to Palmer Lake A beautiful section of highway South. You have some options as you near Castle Rock you can go east on the  into Castle Rock for foodh. There is a concrete path to a frontage road south to Tomah Rd back to the . This adds quite a bit of extra pedaling. I always opt to hit castle rock for mid ride food and ice cream.Or just skip Castle Rock and stay on the  to Palmer Lake. At Palmer Lake you jump onto the New Santa Fe Regional Trail. This is a gravel trail thats well maintained and you will pedal thru the Air Force Academy and into COS. And if you decide to go thru Castle Rock This is perhaps one of my favorite front range tours in state. Its a beautiful ride not very challenging and just a lot of fun. Last time I did it I rode a single speed MTB with zero issues other than I wished I had gears.  ,COBike,d8wnsyq,5,t5_2sfnd
