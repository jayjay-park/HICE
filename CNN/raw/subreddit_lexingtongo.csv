8806031,0,t3_4xr3dl,Update on this I got an armband and tried it out. Almost a complete failure. For whatever reason the game didnt register nearly any of my jog. I ran about  miles and it only said I traveled about . km. I wasnt running in circles either just long straight routes throughout my neighborhood. My guess is that the game just shuts off after so much time of inactivity. I wasnt opening the game or checking anything while running. I turned the game on put it in my armband and then went for my run.Ill try it again either tomorrow or this weekend but so far I cant recommend this to anyone. I may have wasted my money on this armband. ,lexingtongo,d76d67q,1,t5_3fdaz
