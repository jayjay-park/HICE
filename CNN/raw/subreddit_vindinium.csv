4380166,0,t3_38uz6g,Hi.Im about  days late to the thread but I have a vacation day today and decided to try my hand at writing a teambot Its pretty simple at the moment just a bunch of rules of where not to move and to not hurt the teammates if possible. Pathfinding is done using multisource Fringe search although each bot is independant and does not coordinate its paths with the others.Ill keep it fighting for a few days so people can try to come up with countermeasures. ,vindinium,csjdost,1,t5_33hmv
