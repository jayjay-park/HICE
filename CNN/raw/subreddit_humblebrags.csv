The actor was adamant in depicting the Boston gang leader s criminal and personal life as would be ultimately portrayed in the film. To achieve that Depp had attempted to meet with Bulger himself but was declined a meeting and instead consulted Jay Carney Bulger s attorney. Carney appeared on the set during filming a few times to provide feedback on Depp s performance.The site s critical consensus reads Black Mass spins a gripping yarn out of its factbased story  and leaves audiences with one of Johnny Depp s most compelling performances in years. On Metacritic the film has a rating of  out of  based on  critics indicating generally favorable reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B on an A to F scale. Johnny Depp s portrayal of Whitey Bulger received critical acclaim with many critics applauding it as one of his best performances to date.While it did take the top spot it was actually a bit lower than the opening of its predecessor The Maze Runner which opened in the same weekend last year to the tune of . million. The first movie based on James Dashner s young adult novel earned . million domestically and . million internationally for a worldwide total of . million from a  million budget. The sequel was produced with a  million budget so with this lower opening weekend it may have a tougher time earning a profit than the first movie.
