1561588,0,t3_2c4qq0,I want to be in it because i love everyhting about it. The athleticism the acting the travelling its all so cool. As a guy who hasnt started though Im really not looking forward to bumping and taking the bigger bumps ,WredditSchool,cjc0nn6,6,t5_31mcu

2706222,0,t1_cnbfqhs,I appreciate you taking your time to give me some feedback.  Ill try to rewatch and respond.The leg check yeah its a bit cliche like you said.  Was going for the cheap heat.Ill disagree with you on the headlock takedown for two reasons though my gimmick is that I am a pure wrestler and that heel of face im good at what I do and with the size matchup Im taller and can work my leverage to my advantage. He did help sell the size difference by making it look like it took me a bit more ass to get him over.I see what you mean on the lockup.  I need to snap it in more and not necessarily circle around so much.As far as talking to my second the guy Im working is a trainee of his. I cant remember what exactly was going on at that moment I think it had more to do with keeping Hawkins straight.  The match wasnt a straight up squash match but was designed to get me over as a heel and show the crowd Im legit in by debut there.The story I was trying to tell revolved around me being the better pure wrestler and I know that as the heel that goes against conventional story telling but he finds a way to counter what Im doing and showing that I underestimate him.The powder came through some miscommunicationhim not listening. I mentioned in an earlier comment that when he pushed me back the first time he was supposed to do the big brush off pow pow pow shoot me bump bump bump THEN Id powder. Instead of doing the brush off he pushed me back leaving too much space and time so I had to bring up the boot.  We went back to try to get him a good fire up but he pushed again so I took the shoot powdered to regroup and reasses what to do.My nd probably should have waited for me to set Hawkins up again instead of coming out but once Hawkins took himself out of position my nd just kinda said fuck it.On a lighter note we had been doing the gun thing for a bit it started as us shooting down the rats. We started that before the Bullet Club formed. Once the Bullet Club started doing it we were just like fuck it well do it anyways.I again appreciate your feedback and while in retrospect Id probably find smarter ways to do things in that match what I posted above is just the thought process behind what happened as it happened.,WredditSchool,cnboqye,1,t5_31mcu

3794425,0,t3_33vh1z,I dont know what schools are around Illinois  however what the very first thing you should start doing since you stated that you never exercised is to start a FULL ON cardio work out immediately. Mass and flexibility and all that can come later but cardio is so important that it can make or break you sometimes. Start doing Squats pushups sit ups and run a LOT. For example when I was training our day would start out with  squats then the same with sit ups and push ups. Then wed run the ropes until we couldnt run them anymore  rest for a bit then start the actual training with bumps galore  at a time to start then that number climbed as we continued.So if you get used to the three situps pushups and squats NOW... youll be better off. Running is to keep that cardio moving. Have I also said work on Cardio? Cause thats important ,WredditSchool,cqosmoy,3,t5_31mcu

Thanks so much for the advice.Edit I also want the character to be kind of comic relief but at the same time still taken seriously as a bad ass brawling type. I realize the latter is up to me but visually would you feel like a latex or foam sword would take away from it? ,WredditSchool,dfmcqru,1,t5_31mcu
