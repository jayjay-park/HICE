886795,0,t3_2470bi,Im pretty sure there is no physical reason that a trailer would put more weight or pressure on the saddle.Do you ride this bike often?  If so the pain could be a result of sitting on a different position on the saddle or wearing different shoes that result in different pedal position and thus a difference in saddle pressure.  If not this is probably just a result of starting out on a bike again it will take some getting used to.Either way getting a bike fit at a shop even a basic static one would be a good option.,bikefit,ch52yf7,1,t5_2yqq5
