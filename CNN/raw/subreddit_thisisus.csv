10858911,0,t3_5v51dk,Great recap! About this one point though...gt In the pilot episode Randall brings William to his home. William is declining Randalls hospitality and asking to go home. He then tells Randall your father would have been very proud of you. This would imply that William already knows Jack is dead. Keep in mind this man abandoned Randall at a fire station and this is the first time they are meeting yet Randall already told William.In the extras where the cast sits down and talks about the show I watched this on nbcs website  I believe the particular video is episodes  they mention that in the initial pilot the fact that Jack was dead was stated outright in the script rather than being saved for the reveal in a later episode was it ?. They also mention that this particular time when William says Randalls father would have been proud was just a leftover line from the original pilot that they didnt catch.When I saw it for the first time I interpreted it to mean that he was talking about how Randalls father must have been proud of him all throughout his life like even when he was a boy. So perhaps someone else interpreted it that same way which could be why it wasnt caught and edited. ,thisisus,de00qhq,3,t5_30dlx

11175458,0,t3_5zjps6,I fully agree. Many people are treating the show like its a mystery that the entire point is to figure out how Jack died. If anything how he dies is beside the point. What matters is the how the other characters react. I think many tv subs have this problem. Everyone is trying to figure out what is going to happen rather than talk about what happened ,thisisus,deyq4u8,15,t5_30dlx
11202634,0,t3_5zv262,Thats a good theory. I like it a lot. The writers are so obviously painting Jack as a saint he has his faults but he seemingly corrects them quickly and easily. Earlier in the season Rebecca told Jack to quit drinking and he did. Easy peasy I guess. Earlier in the season she told him she needed more help with the kids and whamo next thing we know hes doing everything and shes the one not home much.Theyre writing him as almost perfect and her as selfcentered. I like your reason it makes a lot of sense. My personal criticism of her has nothing to do with her being a woman and everything to do with her being selfish and putting herself before her kids and her husband. She seems to be doing what she wants more than trying to the right thing. Shes a selfish character and theyve written that way.Use this thought experiment imagine their situations were switched. If Rebecca was the one working full time and taking of the kids while Jack was out so much doing something he wanted to do. All the people who think criticism of her is sexistjust honestly imagine how pissed you would be if the situations were reversed.,thisisus,df1syjy,3,t5_30dlx

11256463,0,t1_df5ai4d,gt Ok but he is going to need to come to Kates rescue because she blames herself so stronglyThats not necessarily true.  People overly blame themselves for tragedies all the time.  Just because the writing and pacing has led us to believe that the Cleveland trip is what causes his death and subsequently the root of Kates guilt doesnt make it so.,thisisus,df7wiqd,2,t5_30dlx
