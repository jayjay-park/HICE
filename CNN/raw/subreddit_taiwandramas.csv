10388137,0,t3_5oq6y8,Okay. Lets do this. umentaikoz has laid down the challenge with all the dramas watching. Lets see how I can do. TaiwanThe King of Romance is as wonderful as ever. Still watching RAW and with subs because its paying off to not have to read the subs and get to just watch the crazy gay misinterpretations. Also Lego Lee had some amazing facial expressions that I would miss otherwise. Episode  is still my fave though. Behind Your Smile Ive finally caught up on and Im enjoying even if theres no side couple. Love Cheque Charge is coming to an end. Ive only got  left. I will miss these dumb dumbs. But then the VFocus dumb dumbs are next so Im super excited about that. Im determined to watch one classic at a time so Im picking The Rose back up. I miss long hair Joe Cheng since his new wuxia isnt coming out till much later this year or next year. I also want to watch A Touch of Green but Im waiting till The King of Romance is over. China Ive declared this year the year of the wuxiahistoricals starting with Ice Fantasy. I have no idea what is going on but its super pretty. Go Princess Go is being picked back up this week. No more excuses. I want to watch the She Was Pretty Chinese remake and the lead here is the lead there so I need to finish this first. Is it just me or does China really like the modern dramas melo? They do the cute SOO WELL but there just arent enough of them. KoreaNew tvN drama has Shin Minah in it and we are in love so Im starting that. Gonna start Liar Game and Sassy Go Go this week too cause reasons.Japan I need to watch the movie Liar and His Lover because the Korean drama remake is coming and Im a fan of the leads. From  to  is happening too cause I feel like watching another jdrama. There. Take that. Howd I do? I watch too many dramas. I probably shouldnt mention the US TV that I need to catch up on and am currently watching. Then youll think I dont leave my house and just watch TV all day. Which isnt all that far from the truth but I like to pretend otherwise on occasion.  ,taiwandramas,dclk6hc,1,t5_3hcoo
