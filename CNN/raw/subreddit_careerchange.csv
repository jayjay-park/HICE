11037474,0,t3_5xlggf,I was a nurse manager and honestly it did me no good. Not crazy to do  hours getting that salary for hrs tho all the responsibility nah. Not for me. Im a supervisor right now and its way better but the longer im a nurse the less i want to remain one. Theres soooooo much bullshit tied to it. Too many hands in the pot.,careerchange,dej2tyf,1,t5_2y32k
