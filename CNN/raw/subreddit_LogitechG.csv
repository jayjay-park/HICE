5816338,0,t1_cx8fi9b,Clearly you can see people have legitimate concerns here.  min of silence is not uncommon. adding an option to disable it or change how long it takes to go to sleep would be good. but the best option in my opinion is making the headset wake up by itself when sound is eventually played.  this feature is very annoying indeed. I find myself having to poke my headset to wake up every time Im about to watch a video or something. this is unacceptable for a  headset. if this is not fixed soon I will probably sell it and get the Steal Series H Wireless. that seems to be the best wireless headset out now I shouldve just went with it from the beginning. ,LogitechG,cxi2kjd,3,t5_32hzg

5834598,0,t3_3v5amd,I own the G wireless version of the G. The quality of the headset itself is really nice. Stereo sound quality is probably the best of any of the gaming headsets Ive owned. However before you make the purchase Id recommend you spend a few minutes to read through Logitechs G Headset forums The Logitech Gaming Software used to provide the advanced features for the GG headsets is causing a multitude of problems for many people. My biggest issues with the software are that Currently the drivers only report a stereo device to Windows thus many games will not output surround sound to the headset. The microphone will garble your speech if noise reduction is enabled. Sidetone is practically inaudible even at maximum volume. The headset goes to sleep after  minutes of no or very low volume sound without the ability to change or disable this feature.These headsets have the potential to be the best on the market in my opinion ifwhen Logitech ever irons out these problems with their software. Unfortunately many of these issues have been going on for months across their entire G Headset line with no official word from Logitech as to ifwhen they might be resolved.I would also urge you to look at their Customer Feedback forums You will need to create an account in order to see it but you will see the many complaints regarding their customer service in general across their entire product line.My personal recommendation would be to wait a while to see if they can fix these problems and if you cant wait go with another product.,LogitechG,cxkfy2c,3,t5_32hzg

The specs are really similar but G have g buttons to configure and rgb light. Kave is made from a flexible material you can even twist the headband but G have problems with as i read some people saying on amazon Newegg etc...

Sensei for instance which i currently use also has  sidebuttons and has very low weight.Is there maybe a possibility that there will be a  sidebutton version with the same shape maybe?

From the list find Logitech Gaming Software select it and click on the Uninstall button above the list and follow the instructions from there.In addition to that search for Device Manager in your Start Menu or go to Control Panel again click on Hardware and Sound and then select Device Manager which is in the Devices and Printers subsection and find the Mice and other pointing devices section. You should see HIDcompliant mouse listed there. If you have multiple HIDcompliant mouses there you can just uninstall all of them like I have two identical HIDcompliant mouse options there because of my G but if you only have one or can figure out which mouse is which by looking at the system Events related to it then just go for the one thats for the G. Rightclick on it and select Uninstall and then follow the instructions.Now I havent done this myself personally but I recommend  just to be on the safe side  to unplug the mouse in addition you have to restart your computer using just your keyboard or just the power button on your laptop because the mouse will cease working when you uninstall it from the Device Manager. When your computer restarts and you plug your mouse in again and it boots up it should automatically download basic drivers for the mouse and then you can go download Logitech Gaming Software again.If that doesnt help then...I dunno might wanna take it in for warranty or somethin.,LogitechG,ddjd0fo,1,t5_32hzg

11491565,0,t1_dfyilsx,Hi ever since my last post  months ago I replaced my  with the . The  is now my daily driver and its so cheap that i actually bought a few more for the future. The  is highly recommended  by my favourite mouse reviewer rocket jump ninja so I got it to replace my heavy . Its fine helped me improve my aim but its just so uncomfortable. The shape of the  is the main reason for the swap I have a semi clawpalm grip and gaming with the  is just tiring the center of my palm hurts I tried getting used to it and it was just not working. I think the hump on the  is just too high and pronounced. The s shape is a boring one but it is much more comfortable. I can game for hours without my palm getting uncomfortable. The sensor tracks good enough as well and I cant notice any difference between the sensor of the  and . The buttons are good too and the rgb is pretty sweet. Also worth mentioning that the s cable is thinner and lighter so less obtrusive. One of the best decisions Ive made when it comes to changing peripherals. ,LogitechG,dfykg5n,1,t5_32hzg
