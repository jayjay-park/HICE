606904,0,t1_cg98oph,Thx for taking the time to comment. So what specifically about Hyperstealth makes it definitely rappable? I want to recreate that and get better at it.,hiphopproduction,cg99apa,1,t5_2tb20
1209191,0,t1_ci59y0x,Thanks for all the feedback I really appreciate it. Send me a link to some of yalls work and id be happy to give feedback on any projects.I probably need to EQ a little better and layer a square wave with my subbass so it comes through more on smaller speakers.Changing up the kick pattern and adding some variety and velocity to the highhats would probably making the track more dynamic also.,hiphopproduction,ci5nho7,1,t5_2tb20
5921806,0,t3_3wf57j,That snaresnap is weak sauce. Add a phaser or some kind of filter modulation to the dulcimer or whatever strings to make it sound less clean. Getting good.,hiphopproduction,cxvvp12,1,t5_2tb20
