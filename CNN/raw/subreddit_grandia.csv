4878785,0,t1_cu9gsdo,It is a little weird but hey the game was balanced really well so I say its fine ultimately. Good luck I was at or above  on all characters when I took on the Tower and it wasnt so bad. This was also after farming my skills too. Finished everyone except Feena at the time. ,grandia,cu9ibli,1,t5_2tqke
