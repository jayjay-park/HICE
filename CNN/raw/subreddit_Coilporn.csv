1187107,0,t3_27kupi,Theyre not as much as some vendors would like you to think. Its not like a battery rated for A pulse would simply explode when you pull A through it. Ratings are all about how long a given load can safely be powered. The A rating is given by Sony as ltsec which is very likely why sellers would choose to advertise that as the pulse rating. Theyre even rated for ltA with ltsec pulse. Another thing to note is that the continuous rating also correlates to the listed capacity of the cell. Pulling A pulses on a VTC is of course going to give you significantly less than the mAh capacity. ,Coilporn,ci362j2,1,t5_2z3ff

Thats what Im doingMt Baker Vaping Storypack a day a couple more.  ish. Maybe closer to  than  years really. I love cigarettes or did love up until a week or so ago I could still feel that love strongly. Im now not so sure. I mean I knew for years they didnt curb my anxiety or calm me or do any good but take my money and well being. But they were my constant companion my sense of control that I couldnt control my statement of I make my own decisions I can slowly kill myself if I want all while not really making an active decision in the process. Coval Story How I came to have  Mini Protank Vs.I bought my first mini at a BampM and a few days later sat on it playing with my dog. Crunch. I bought another one at the same BampM the same day then got online and ordered a replacement glass for the first one. Protank count   minus glass When this order came in the mail I found that they sent me a new Mini Protank and not just the glass I ordered. Well cool but I still have a full tank minus glass. Protank count   minus glass So I ordered another replacement glass and this time was drunk and got a normal Protank glass. Oops tried again for the mini glass and got another full Mini Protank in the mail. Protank count   minus glass Great again! but...so I ordered a new glass and finally got one. The End Protank count  fully functional. I wouldnt try this method of getting cheap Protank minis...I was just oddly lucky. Anyway now I have a kayfun and my poor minis are lonely. ,Coilporn,cicvllh,1,t5_2z3ff

1694970,0,t1_cjsi90u,Yep the airholes I was referring to.  Theyre super tiny and dont proved nearly enough cooling for the coils.  Drilled out the Nimbus is excellent.  My only complaint is the size of the atty its a bit small so there will be a lip on most if not all mods.  You cant beat the price though got mine at a local bampm for  bucks.

1709536,0,t1_cjuh7u3,Put an Allen wrench also called Allen key into the chuck of a drill bit with the smaller handle sticking out. Get gauge kanthal about    feet and fold it in half. On the non loop side even the two ends and twist them together about  times. Loop the other end over the Allen wrench and hold the side you just manually twisted in a pair of pliers or vise grips and slowly being to start the drill. You do not want to wrap it too right because it will snap if it does it isnt a big deal you just wont have a continuous piece of wire. Hope that helped,Coilporn,cjund8a,1,t5_2z3ff

2304372,0,t1_clwj6dd,The outer wire does heat up but whether or not it covers your leads makes no difference.

Since one is wrapped with the twist and the other is wrapped against the twist. I dont really know how to explain it any better. maybe next time you could try twisting one in the opposite direction so they might come out more symmetrical. EDIT I thought of a better analogy you know how rope is usually a few strands of thinner twine all twisted in the same direction and then twisted together in the opposite direction like this  Well if you took the same strands and twisted them the SAME direction obviously one is going to look different to the other. ,Coilporn,cnjcsl2,2,t5_2z3ff

4326672,0,t1_csd347g,the leg may have been shorting on the coil especially if you noticed the resistance got higher if you pushed the coil lower. I try to have my legs positioned so they are not bending at all but it doesnt always work out like that. when tightening the screws I found it works best if I put the lead through on the side that will get grabbed and pulled by the screw.  hard to explain over text. so you screw clockwise to tighten put the lead in at the  oclock position. if you tighten the screw and it doesnt grab its the wrong side  that should solve any issues with that area. if your legs are crossing over the coil a little insert whatever you wrapped your coil over to keep the shape and reposition the coil using tweezers to pull the leg out at the end of the coil. test to see the ohms stay steady and then you can dry fire in pulses dont just hold it down and pinch out the hot spots. if the coil is that little bit too big try wrapping another one one wrap less,Coilporn,csdcfe4,1,t5_2z3ff

9772760,0,t1_dah5krp,Thanks! Means a lot coming from a builder like you. Question for you though. Assuming you fold your ribbon stack in half for a swivel loop then make your spaced staple. Now for your two outer core ribbons do you fold those in half as well over the existing loop and secure it? Or do you do strips of ribbons on each side not folded? If that makes sense ,Coilporn,dahpj5g,1,t5_2z3ff
9779663,0,t3_5f9b4p, Wicking and fire shots.  Vapes better than anything Ive tried before.  Probably because Ive wicked it properly because I can see how this could go sideways very easily.

10090070,0,t3_5k6xiy,Came in here to say that deck looks like nothing but leak problems and the comments arent helping me think it isnt. Can anyone chime in otherwise... That airflow directly to the coil interests me. Bottom airflow is great for some builds. Side airflow is better for others....

10324480,0,t1_dce4m9r,A key ring as in that metal ring you wind keys onto to create a bunch well here we just use the ring. You get your cores lined up in the drill then at the swivels if you use those at the other end. I usually do about  wraps here with the outer wire then crimp flat with plies. Next you wind that ring carefully onto the cores so that all cores are held sandwiched between the ring. Not all rings have  full circles you need one that does. You start with the ring about an inch from the drill then slide it along an inch or so when you get to it. Restart spinning slowly and once your on track speed up again. Hope this helps ,Coilporn,dcec50x,3,t5_2z3ff
10454397,0,t1_dcsuskm,Its a tad bit more flavorful denser and warmer. Not much of a difference. It all depends on what kind of wire and how many wraps. This build itself wasnt my most favorite for flavor but it does have very good cloud production.,Coilporn,dct3yl9,1,t5_2z3ff
10491342,0,t1_dcx0c2c,I do that with claptons if not tight enough as well pI think i fcked up during the spacing on the spaced clapton.I used a keychain with one key only on as a weight on a loop to make the spacing.I think it needs some more weight.,Coilporn,dcxay9w,1,t5_2z3ff
