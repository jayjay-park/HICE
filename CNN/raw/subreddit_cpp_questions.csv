117017,0,t3_1vfhek,If I read those comments right the functions are sorted by the base class they are first defined in which is not a bad idea if you have a deep inheritance hiearchy. Now imagine a base class that defines both public and protected virtual functions you want to override. In your derived class you can either sort the classes by access modifier first then by base class or first by base class then by access modifier. Valve decided to use the second sort order in favor of repeating the access modifier.That they superfluously repeated the access modifier here even if they didnt have to not only keeps things consistent it also safeguards the code against future additions of a protected overridden methods in say IClientThinkable.,cpp_questions,cerr8dt,2,t5_2tdbd

351713,0,t3_1y3m9r,Hi! So I think you have a bit of a misunderstanding of how functions are defined as well as how the return type of a function is related to that functions arguments.In C a function is allowed to return any predefined type or a user defined type  and whether or not that functions arguments are logically related to its return type depends largely on the programmer who wrote that function.What is a type you ask? A type is simply a representative of some data structure. Data structures can be simple like an integer  which is defined with eight bytes of precision and has a sign or as a class or structure  which can be arbitrarily complicated.In general a functions inputoutput IO is defined by its signature.A signature consists of a return type and the type of its arguments.So really if a function takes integer arguments there is no requirement that it returns an integer type. In fact one of the strengths of C is its ability to abstract a function via templating  which does not make an explicit type requirement of input OR output types.For example think of a function which takes two arguments and adds them  perhaps a good design consideration would be to return the sum of that functions arguments. Well now we have a problem because if you define a function called add you expect it to do the right thing regardless of its argument types. So two floating point numbers fed to this function should return a floating point type sum. Two integer type arguments should return an integer type sum.But what if you give this function two arguments such as stdstring? What does addition mean in this case? Some people think it should mean concatenation while other people think the function should throw an error of some kind.So ultimately the message is that a functions argument type does not have to have an explicit relation to its return type. Let me know if you have other questions!,cpp_questions,cfh80u4,2,t5_2tdbd

1686385,0,t3_2doij5,The idea behind usages of the form amp ... and  ... is that youre stating the default and then providing a list of exceptions.  Consequently everything in ... must be the opposite of the default otherwise they wouldnt be exceptions.  The ... in amp ... must be a list of identifiers without amp in front and thus amp this is fine and the ... in  ... must be a list of identifiers with amp in front.  But this can only ever be captured by value never by reference thus ampthis and  ampthis are both illegal as is  this because its not expressing an exception that differs from the default.Because this can only ever be captured by value you can still write amp and have this captured implicitly.  The idea here is that by stating a default you were allowing anything to be captured so this is allowed.  Its captured by value not by reference but thats because theres no choice in the matter.  Youd only have to write this if you didnt provide a default in which case you have to be explicit about what you want captured you have to list them all out foo ampbar baz this.  amp this is allowed because its not a violation of the requirements outlined above but it doesnt differ from amp except that its somewhat more explicit to the human reader.Just to be clear the fact that this is only ever captured by value does not mean that you get copies of member variables.  Remember that this is a pointer and making a copy of it says nothing about the things it points to.  Thats why it wouldnt make any sense to capture it by reference and why thats not allowed.  The only reason you would want a reference to a pointer is if you wanted to make it point elsewhere and you cant do that with this as its not a lvalue.  You can assign to this but you cant assign to this.In other words you are never capturing any member variables.  You are capturing a pointer that points to an instance of an object and you can follow that pointer and mutate whatever member variables are on the other end.  That happens implicitly without you having to write thisgtfoo or this.foo by just referring to foo the compiler automatically turns it into the latter.,cpp_questions,cjrqep2,3,t5_2tdbd

5415020,0,t3_3p7cew,gtvoid bPhysicsFixedUpdateThreaded stdvectorltstdthreadgt threadpoolThere are two things wrong with this. You are getting a copy of the vector so overwriting the threads via new wont be reflected in the caller.. Taking a pointer to a stdthread is very likely going to be unsafe. For example what if thread A creates thread B then threads C created by thread A and D created by thread B take a pointer to B and call Bgtjoin? There is a reason stdthread is a moveonly type.  A stdthread is a resource handle just like a stdvector so value semantics are what you want.Combining these with    for int i   i lt threadpool.size i         threadpool.ati  new stdthreadampbPhysicsGeneratePairs this i     means that whatever threads were stored in the vector before this function was called are now being overwritten and leaked too!. The forkjoin idiom you are using is fine but you dont want to use it inside of a loop. The cost of spinning up all of those threads is very much nontrivial.     for int i   i lt threadpool.size i          threadpool.ati  new stdthreadampbPhysicsComputePhysicsThreaded this i    This leaks all of your threads again. You now possibly have threadpool.size threads leaked at this point it depends on how many threads were in threadpool when the function was called. You definitely want to fix this before you do anything else.Effectively what you are trying to do with this forkjoin pattern is to spawn a gang of threads have them generate pairs synchronize then do the physics. The C threading library doesnt yet! have a barrier construct so you will need to build one using condition variables as uspookje suggested if your instructor werent insane you could switch to using OpenMP which does have a barrier construct. Effectively what you would do then is something like this.    stdvectorltstdthreadgt threadpoolNUMTHREADS    auto dophysics  thisunsigned i mutable  GeneratePairs  BARRIER  ComputePhysicsThreaded     forunsigned i iltthreadpool.size i         threadpooli  stdmovestdthreaddophysicsi    In GeneratePairs you call contacts.emplacebackm. Assuming that contacts is a data member of bPhysics and not declared locally this is not thread safe. You need to put a lock on it it looks like you have one commented out. Also its a little weird to call emplaceback with an alreadyconstructed object as the only argument. The purpose of emplaceback is to construct an object from a sequence of arguments notably the ones matching some constructor signature in place. Passing in an alreadyconstructed object is essentially going to invoke the copy constructor so I would just call pushback here.I would have to sit down and think about your problem in more detail and with more details like how the integration functions are implemented before I could give you more advice on how to thread over the calculations. However I do have a few parting comments.I would advise moving away from using stdvectorltTgtat and use stdvectorltTgtoperator instead. at does bounds checking which we dont need here because we have set the size of the vector at its creation and didnt perform any subsequent insertions or deletions.    bBody B  ampbodies.atjThis is C lets not revert to old C habits.    bBodyamp B  bodiesj,cpp_questions,cw3tsrr,7,t5_2tdbd
5425876,0,t3_3panhi,Sorry Ive had a read through your code but its super confusing and convoluted. To go through point by point would take far too long which is probably why nobody has posted yet. I can try to answer some specific points thoughgt  I dont know how to use my previous foodSupply functionfrom my first class on the vector of Condos in my new class. If I knew this I would have a value for my structfood.Well if you want to call the member function foodSupply for each member of a vector of condos you could do    for int i i lt CondoList.size i         double thissupply  CondoList.ati.foodSupply        do something with thissupply...    gt  The code above I dont know how to place the struct data into the vector. I tried a bunch of things but the compiler hates me.The code you posted at the top is all wrong for a number of reasons. It seems like youre trying to create a foodAmount object with the input data nT and then push that onto a vector recordsP. First of all     stdvectorltfoodAmountgt recordsP constThis declares a const function which returns a vector of foodAmounts Im not sure thats what you want to do. In general to push back onto a vector of foodAmounts    assume we have this vector somewhere    stdvectorltfoodAmountgt foodvec    ...    create a temp foodAmount with the input data     foodAmount tempnT    add it to the vector    foodvec.pushbacktempIn general why is checkFoodSupply a class? Thats a pretty weird design choice to pass in your vector condoList and then store a copy to do operations on it. Just make free functions to operate on the data directly.When I look at the code in general and e.g. code like this    foodAmountnT    foodAmount recordsP.pushbackfoodAmountthere are so many errors. To attempt a program like this it seems like youre running before you can walk no offense intended. Get a good book work through the problems study the code samples.

You are never deallocating the nodes data  . removeNode never looks at the first element in the list the first line is tnodegtnext!  . You are never rewiring the linked list after deleting a node make sure you do the rewire just before you delete the node!Additionally you should really learn how to use whatever debugger is available on your system be it gdb or visual studios debugger.

6514270,0,t3_44uxu2,It looks like your build system might be trying to compile ReceiptBag.cpp directly.If youre including ReceiptBag.cpp in ReceiptBag.h you shouldnt be trying to compile ReceiptBag.cpp.A common convention when separating template member function definitions into separate source files that get included at the bottom of the header is to name them something other than cpp e.g. tpp txx. Maybe youre using an IDE that is being confused into thinking that it needs to compile your cpp file directly.edit not that it matters but I dont putting template definitions in separate files and including them at the bottom of the header that much. If I want them separated at all i.e. not inlined into the class definition because they are too long or something I usually just write them at the bottom of the header directly. Ive worked at places that require doing the thing I dont like but I never understood the motivation other than to make things seem more like nontemplate C.

I commented out the Ground ampground parameters of the constructor to leave it empty and also got rid of the member initialiser list as well as some of the code inside the constructor that uses the object because it isnt there anymore. Anyway after doing all that it works. Constructor doesnt do anything but it all works.I set a private variable equal to the object I pass into the constructor so my modifications from the last paragraph tell me that the problem lies there.My aim was to avoid making loads of objects in all the files that I need to use their functions ideally i was aiming to make one object of each class type and then pass them around through the code in references to avoid making more.

6761644,0,t3_48cjil,That book is aimed at teaching programming to new students using C as a tool rather than specifically teaching C. It sounds like you have a bit of programming experience already so some of the information you can skim over but some topics may not have been covered well in your other experiences They might not be relevant to the other languages youve used or perhaps just not well covered by most programming curricula. Those are the things to focus on if you want to get more out of the book.Looking at the table of contents here are what I think those topics might be Chapter  the sections on compilation and linking Chapter  the section on type safety and unsafe conversion Chapter  errors estimation debugging pre and postconditions and testing Chapter  Completing a Program cleaning up the code recovering from errors Chapter  Technicalities Functions etc. the sections on declarations vs. definitions header files passbyvalue vs. other schemes constexpr namespaces Chapter  Technicalities Classes etc. sections on operator overloading Part III Data and Algorithms the whole thing is sort of an intro to Cs ltalgorithmgt and ltiteratorgt libraries. Chapter  the sections on resources and RAII Chapter  the section on coding standards Chapter  TestingThe other thing you should do is write code.

XCode is tricky just because you arent sure where the directory is where it looks for files in terms of custom IO.By default I believe the location where xcode looks for files is the folder where your .xcodeproj file is. Im never sure though because it can change depending on your IDE setup. It is always easier to change that though to point to a location you choose...When you are in your project within xcode click the tool bar ProductgtSchemegtEdit SchemeHere you might have to search around based on different versions but you want to find something called Working Directory there will be an unchecked checkbox with an empty textbox. Check the box and use the browse folder to navigate to your project where your source files are located. Now when you do IO files it will look in this location for them.An easy way to check to make sure you locating the correct file is writing a simple program like so...    include ltiostreamgt    include ltfstreamgt    using namespace std        int main            ifstream inFilemyFile.txt    This will be where you set your working direct path to        if!inFile                   cout ltlt File Not Found ltlt endl                else                   cout ltlt File Found! ltlt endl           inFile.close                  return     ,cpp_questions,d2j0yy7,1,t5_2tdbd

8324737,0,t3_4tkd1g,To communicate with a remote system you need to have your client local speaking the same language as the server remote. To do that you need the details on the protocol.That might be in the form of a document that tells you send me these bytes and Ill do this. Send me these other bytes and Ill do this other thing instead. It might also be in the form of a software library that does it for you. That will look like functions you can call that will send and receive the necessary data. Youll see them called an API Application Programming Interface or sometimes SDK Software Development Kit.With what youre describing wanting to do I think a better starting point would be to write both the server AND the client. You can keep the data format really simple and perhaps test it using telnet.For example you could make a server that listens for a string of text followed by a carriage return. Once it gets it it returns the reverse of that string. You can test it by connecting to it via telnet at first then by using your own client. From there work on extending it out to support other functions. Maybe a getset interface where the client can set some values and later retrieve them. That would operate a lot like an embedded device with configurable registers.,cpp_questions,d5i5b1q,1,t5_2tdbd

8976883,0,t3_538pg4,Every stream has associated with it a set of flags represented as a bitfield.  If you ask the stream to do something that it cant do such as extract a double when the contents of the stream cannot be parsed as a double i.e. cin gtgt d then it sets the fail bit and does not touch d.  Once the fail bit is set further formatted IO operations fail immediately without attempting to do anything.The stream also has a boolean conversion operator which reflects the state of the fail bit.  Anything you use in a whilestatement or ifstatement is contextually converted to bool.  So if you write something like    whilecin gtgt d         ...    The body of the loop only runs if the conversion was successful.  If you enter a string which cant be parsed as a double the fail bit is set and the loop is terminated.  Nothing is abruptly exiting.  The loop is running exactly as you wrote it to completion.The same thing applies to chained operations like whilecin gtgt d gtgt unit.  If the first extraction fails and sets the fail bit then the second extraction isnt even attempted and the loop is terminated.  And likewise the loop is terminated if the second extraction fails but the first was successful.  This is the idiomatic way to write code that should only run if all extractions were successful and fails if any of them fails. In C this was implemented as a conversion to void  for complicated reasons but in C and later its implemented as an explicit bool conversion operator.  The ability to mark a conversion operator as explicit was new in C and resolved the problems that lead to an implicit bool conversion operator being troublesome and the need to use a void  conversion operator.,cpp_questions,d7qvviq,3,t5_2tdbd

10119236,0,t1_dbp2lb7,gtI appreciate the sentiment here but IMHO its a little overboard to create a class for this... Its a simple read after all.Not using structured types in C is asking for trouble. For example in the OPs original code there was a call to malloc without an associated call to free leading to resource leaks. Of course it would be acceptable to replace unsigned short buffer  unsigned short  malloc sizeofunsigned shortlSize with stdvectorltunsigned shortgt buffer to fix this but now there is a timet associated with a stdvectorltunsigned shortgt without any reason. Building a type to ensure they are always used coherently and the proper invariants are upheld in this case making sure there is memory behind the vector. Ultimately I did assume this code was just a small part of some larger program where the buffer would actually correspond to data with greater meaning e.g. a matrix.C is a general purpose language but I wouldnt use it when just needing to read write and manipulate arrays. Fortran has much better syntax for that.gtAlso I recommend and prefer using stdchrono over timet but thats not really a huge deal anyhow.As do I but the OPs code was using timet.,cpp_questions,dbqjlbq,1,t5_2tdbd

After reading it a few more times I see what you were saying was intended to be about stdvalarray. Mea culpa.gtWhats with all this you should not use pointers nonsense when im very clear about building a classclasses around it that even range checks?Because of the decay rule for arrays in C such that T gt T when passed as a parameter. In the example the inner member is being accessed as if it were public. This means that users could do fooparentArrayi.iArray and get a conversion to pointer avoid at all costs. Performing a single malloc and then breaking it up to serve as the backing store for the data members would require doing pointer arithmetic in order to set the extents at runtime. If you leave that to the user then they will need owning pointers. If you wrap all of this then you need owning pointers.gtLike I said I already could build this kind of structure.Are you talking about the code you posted? Because thats not legal C. VLAs are not part of the standard. Yes gcc allows them as a GNU extension but they should feel bad about that.If you know the rank of subArray at compiletime you could use boostmultiarray to set the extents at runtime. You could then have a collection of multiarrays for parentArray.include boostmultiarray.hppinclude ltstringgtint mainint argc char argv int i  stdstoiargv  Create a D array that is  x i x    rank must be known at compiletime but extents can be set at runtime boostmultiarrayltdouble gt AboostextentsiIf you cant use Boost or this solution wouldnt work then I would recommend using stdvectorwith your own allocator that uses an arena which can guarantee contiguous allocations.,cpp_questions,dd66j96,1,t5_2tdbd

10816863,0,t3_5uos8w,gt what are the comparealloc template arguments for?They customize behavior of the class by specifying how elements are compared and how memory is allocated.  They have default values of stdlessltKeygt and stdallocatorltstdpairltconst Key Tgtgt respectively so you dont have to worry about them if you want the default behavior.gt What are member types are they typedefs? Types can be members of classes.  They can be implemented via typedef but they dont have to be.  For example    include ltvectorgt    struct foo         typedef int bar                templatelttypename Tgt        using baz  stdvectorltTgt        int main            foobar x              analogous to int x                foobazltdoublegt y      analogous to stdvectorltdoublegt y       In the case of the standard library containers the member types tell you aspects about how they work.  For example the valuetype being defined as stdpairltconst Key Tgt tells you that the container stores values as pairs.gt Even in the usage I just linked Im still confused as to how ... Prints out the key and the corresponding value...Youd need to read the definition of the iterator type to see that dereferencing an iterator returns a value of the member type reference which is defined as valuetypeamp which is a reference to a pair.  Youd then read the documentation for stdpair to see that it has members first and second for the two pair values.By the way you should not use cplusplus.com.  Use cppreference.com instead.  cplusplus.com has very dubious examples and explanations.  In this case the example is horrible because its still stuck in C.

11392857,0,t3_62eflm,Some background info you probably also need a tutorial for concrete tool usage this is not thatLets define a C library as a package of reusable code comprising A zero or more C translation units andor B support code such as inline functions and type definitions.Reusable code can be provided as source code or in compiled form or most commonly as a combination.However for support code in group B we have to wait for C modules before such code can be portably provided in compiled form and Im not sure that it can be done even then. Visual C has since at least Visual C  had experimental module support that is close to what will hopefully be adopted for C but I havent used it. Anyway until g and clang which implements an earlier variant catch up code using this feature is effectively not portable.The programming term module has had many meanings through the years including being used for single routines for a class as in Bertrand Meyers Eiffel langauge and for a separately compiled unit of code. However the meaning that well get with C modules is closer to the meaning in Niklaus Wirths Modula Modula and Oberon language or a s Pascal unit or an Ada package. With this meaning a C translation unit is an example of a module and a packaging of support code in class B above can be a module a different example of module. So in this view a library is a package of modules most of which will usually be complete C translation units.If a module is provided only as source code then that can be as a header file or files designed for being included as an implementation file or a combination. A concrete example of just an implementation file is a module that declares some static object whose constructor configures the standard iostreams e.g. such that they work for international text. But usually a source code module is instead comprised entirely of one or more header files and is then called a header only module.In particular template code is usually provided as header only modules.The Boost library is an example of a library that is collection of smaller libraries sublibraries. Much of Boost is template code and so many sublibraries of Boost are header only libraries. This makes it very easy to use those parts of Boost all you need is to configure your compilers include path where it looks for headers. A main possible cost of this approach is possibly increased build times since the compiler must parse all the code.If a librarys modules are provided as compiled code plus header files then the compiled code can be a static library or a Unixstyle dynamic library called a shared library or a Windowsstyle dynamic library called a DLL dynamically linked library.A static library is nothing more than a collection of compiled C translation units. Whatever you use of static library becomes part of your executable. If all used libraries are static libraries then your executable is selfcontained.Static libraries are compiler dependent or more specifically linkerdependent but my impression is that in Unixland its pretty standardized. At least for C and I gather its so also for C the problem if there is one is name mangling of C stuff. In Windows however you can get into problems if a static library created with e.g. g is used with Visual C or vice versa. Theres some compatibility but not all the way.So even for static libraries compiled code is more specific less portable. One may end up with umpteen variants. Which means that for a library vendor its generally desirable to just provide source code also for implementation files and let each user build the binaries from source.Dynamic libraries are essentially linked at loadtime or runtime. Your executable only contains references to what it needs from the dynamic libraries. This means that dynamic libraries can be updates separately from the applications using them and it means that the code provided by a dynamic library is not redundantly copied in every using executable. Separate updates of dynamic libraries can be good and it can be bad. It can be so bad that Microsoft at one time invented a term for it DLL hell.The C standard does not directly support dynamic libraries. It does not even acknowledge that such beasts exist. The only probably intended as support that Im aware of is a statement relating initialization of static variables to execution of statements in main. In C its ..gt  It is implementationdefined whether the dynamic initialization of a nonlocal variable with static storage duration is done before the first statement of main. If the initialization is deferred to some point in timeafter the first statement of main it shall occur before the first odruse . of any function or variable defined in the same translation unit as the variable to be initialized.And so dynamic libraries are very much system dependent.The Unixland variant shared libraries can as a conceptual model be viewed as just delaylinked static libraries. In particular if two shared libraries used by your app both use a third library X and perhaps your app also directly uses X then X is provided by a single static or dynamic library. This can be good and it can be bad.The Windows variant DLLs are better viewed as separate executables that export functions and variables. In fact they use the same file format as executable files called a PE format file a Portable Executable. If two DLLs used by your app both use a third library X such as the C runtime library ! and perhaps your app also uses X then X can be provided by a different static or dynamic library for each DLL and for your apps main code. This can be good and it can be bad. Its generally a good idea to let a DLL use a DLL version of the runtime.One nice feature of Windows DLLs is that within the Windows world they provide a measure of portability not just between various compilers but across languages. Just about any compiled language can be used to access C style functionality in a DLL. And if C functionality is structured as Windows COM classes also these can be accessed portably across languages. But this comes at great cost. Ive already mentioned Microsofts term DLL Hell and the sheer complexity of supporting and conforming to COM is another great cost.

11559892,0,t3_64ydrz,    include ltiostreamgt    include ltmath.hgt    include ltcmathgt        using namespace stdThe statement using namespace std brought into scope everything inside cmath math.h and iostream.  And why do you have both cmath and math.h?  cmath should basically be everything in math.h except it is inside namespace std eg math.h provides cos but cmath provides stdcos.  Your using namespace std actually then instructs the compiler to parse cos as stdcos from cmath rather than cos from math.h.  I would recommend getting rid of include ltmath.hgt and getting rid of using namespace std.  I see that youll use cout endl and cin a lot so I would suggest you bring just those into your scope like this    using stdcout    using stdendl    using stdcin        const float PI  .        class trigFunctions        public            float cosineFunctionfloat u float angle                float hz  u  cosangle  PI  .                return hz                        float sineFunctionfloat u float angle                float vert  u  sinangle  PI  .                return vert                This is a class with no data members.  Classes are meant to be instantiated as objects so as is this doesnt make sense from an OOP perspective.  If you want it to be OOPlike then you should have this    class Trig         double u theta    public        Trigdouble u double theta  uu thetatheta          double Cos const  return u  stdcostheta  PI  .        double Sin const  return u  stdsintheta  PI  .    and instead of using trigAccess.sineFunctionu angle youd use Trigu angle.Sin.  Personally here Id make them plain old functions    namespace Trig             double Cosdouble u double theta                  return u  stdcostheta  PI  .                        double Sinfloat u float angle                return u  stdsintheta  PI  .                Also notice how its not necessary to say float vert  usinanglePI. and then return vert but you can just directly return the result of that calculation.  Instead of trigAccess.sineFunctionu angle youd just use TrigSinu angle.  The  is the scope operator and its how you traverse namespaces as well as access static members of classes you can also access nonstatic members in order to get a pointer to them like a pointertomemberfunction ... you dont need to care about that right now if at all.        class SUVAT        public            float finalVelocityfloat u float g float s                float v  powpowu  gs.                return v                        float timeToVfloat v float u float g                float time  v  u  g                return time                        float displacementfloat v float u float g                float displacement  powv  powu    g                return displacement                I think you can take the comments about trigFunctions to see how you could improve this section either to be OOPlike eg SUVAT kinematicsu g s v and kinematics.finalVelocity kinematics.timeToV kinematics.displacement or as SUVATfinalVelocityu g s SUVATtimeToVv u g and SUVATdisplacementv u g.  Classes can be useful when you have a group of functions that seem to share the same input arguments.  So here youve written them as pure functions or nearly and Im noticing that u v and g are shared among more than one of them.  If you had an object with u v and g and maybe s then these functions dont need to have those values passed into them and instead you can store them in the class and then based on that classs data members be able to calculate what you need.  And yes your function bodies should probably be one liners.        int main        bool curvature    float u    float angle    float platform    float g        cout ltlt Do you want to account for the curvature of the earth?   yes   no    cin gtgt curvature        cout ltlt Enter u gt    cin gtgt u        cout ltlt Enter angle to the horizontal gt    cin gtgt angle        cout ltlt Enter height above ground gt    cin gtgt platform        cout ltlt Enter g gt    cin gtgt gOh boy.  General rule declare your variables when you need them.  Id rewrite this as    int main         cout ltlt Do you want to account for the curvature of the earth?   yes   no        bool curvature        cin gtgt curvature                cout ltlt Enter u gt         float u        cin gtgt u                cout ltlt Enter angle to the horizontal gt         float angle        cin gtgt angle                cout ltlt Enter height above ground gt         float platform        cin gtgt platform                cout ltlt Enter g gt         float g        cin gtgt gI also added a space after each gt since I think its a little tidier when someone goes and enters things.          trigFunctions trigAccess        SUVAT SUVATaccessYeah this is why your OOP approach was weird.  What does it mean to instantiate a class with no data members that only provides pure functions?  Its like youre conceptually instantiating a namespace something you cant do so that trigAccess.cosineFunction is doing what trigAccesscosineFunction should be doing in your code the symbol trigAccesscosineFunction would be a pointertomemberfunction at least with a amp before it not sure about without it its either a compile error or implicitly a pointertomemberfunction.            float hz  trigAccess.cosineFunctionu angle        float vert  trigAccess.sineFunctionu angle                float v  SUVATaccess.finalVelocityvert g platform        float time    SUVATaccess.timeToVvert  g        float time  SUVATaccess.timeToVv vert g                float hzDisplacement  time  time  hzThese are all fine but Id suggest that you add the keyword const and use const float or float const as the data type.  The two mean the same thing.  The reason is that when you add the word const it makes it impossible to reset the variable to something else.  This is great for values that should not change ie what immutable means and const makes a variable immutable.                float timeTotal        float hzTotal                if curvature  true             float curvey  hzDisplacement  .  .            float vAfterCurve  SUVATaccess.finalVelocityv g curvey            float time  SUVATaccess.timeToVvAfterCurve v g            float curvex  time  hz                    timeTotal  time  time  time            hzTotal  hzDisplacement  curvex         else             timeTotal  time  time            hzTotal  hzDisplacement        ifcurvature  true is not the same as ifcurvature  true.  The latter has two  and tests for equality.  It checks to see if the left and the right are the same and returns true if it they are and false if they arent.  With one  it is assignment.  What assignment actually does is copies the value on the right hand side and stores in into the variable on the left hand side and then returns the left hand side.  See if it returned nothing then this code wouldnt compile  which you may prefer  but you couldnt do multiple assignment like a  b  c to set both a and b to the value of c youd have to do a  c b  c.  Now the fact that assignment returns the left hand side means that this code is the same as curvature  true ifcurvature.  Guess what thats always true.  So your else block is literally unreachable code.  Usually you need to wrap this kind of statement in parentheses meaning ifcurvature  true for the compiler to not complain about it.  If you were getting warnings about stuff and turned it off turn them back on.  Your compiler is really helpful if you know how to read it.                cout ltlt endl        cout ltlt time of flight was  ltlt timeTotal ltlt endl ltlt endl        cout ltlt particle lands  ltlt hzTotal ltlt m away from origin ltlt endl ltlt endl        cout ltlt maximum height above ground  ltlt SUVATaccess.displacementvert  g  platform ltlt endl ltlt endl                return     Good you remembered return  at the end.,cpp_questions,dg6bgmo,6,t5_2tdbd
