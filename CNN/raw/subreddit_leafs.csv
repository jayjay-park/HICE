When you look at your C imo you dont look at anything other than how good they are at putting the puck in the netgenerating offence. In this sense Kadri is the best centre on the team.Im not saying that Bozak is a bad player by any means I think hed make a decent C or a strong C on some teams if he were on a team like pittsSJHawksetc but he just isnt our best offensive weapon down the centre. I know the fancy stat crowd yells numbers in regards to the KadriBozak debate but doesnt it pass the eye test? Its pretty clear that Kadri is just a better hockey player.

459635,0,t3_1zcseh,So this logic. Trade a  year old centre in Kadri a guy who can carry a team in Reimer who is a RFA not an UFA and throw in a pick for Ryan Kesler.....and then with your projected lineups you put Kesler on the SECOND line? You cannot be for real. Vancouver wouldnt want to have Reimer they already have Luongo and Lack both who are decent for them. Theyd most likely want somewhere along the lines of Jake Gardiner or Cody Franson a st round pick in the future perhaps and a prospect in the system. Offense has never been an issue with this team so I dont know why you want the Leafs to go after Kesler.. just doesnt make sense to me. I can see where youre coming from if you are one of the fans who are like Oh the Leafs need a  Centre yeah.. but the thing is that were doing perfectly fine without a True number one centre in Bozak. The line is second in points to the Tavares line correct? I wouldnt go after Kesler right now. ,leafs,cfsidix,5,t5_2r8hf

That is part of the equation for me too.I would like to get Edler too. My ideal trade would be a blockbuster but I was trying to keep it real.I would like to send Kadri Reimer Gunnerson or Franson and another player or pick to VAN for Kesler and Edler. It makes a lot of sense to me. Reimer and Franson are both UFA this summer. Time to sell high.

630793,0,t1_cgbyk2f,I hear this often he has influenced the other organizations but I would like to know how that translates in the NHL.The NHL has a cap limit which the Leafs are tightly up against.And if he does want to have players obtained via cash have a look at the UFA list for this summer  There isnt any of significance in play for where the team requires help.Next would be trades and no matter how much he yells and screams in order to pull a trade off you require a willing partner and a transaction which has to fit many variables.A  You have to protect the assets you want to build with and offer ones you are willing to part with.B The opposing GM has to like what he sees.C Leafs have to target what they require which wont come with a light or fair price.So again tight up against making trades as this team doesnt even have influx of prospects that they can offer to sweeten deals or to replace for what is sent out.Only place he can touch is management and availability of such would start with coaching which is limited as well.So what is Timmy going to change here? ,leafs,cgbyzw2,3,t5_2r8hf

If someone burned a Canadian or whatever country you represent yourself with Flag in front of your face how can you not even consider telling them they are wrong and its disrespectful EVERYONE involved should take offense to that because it is part of who we are as a people and as a nation. The same is said for a logo it represents who we are as a nation and plays a role in defining who we are as people and if you dont take offense to someone blatantly disrespecting you then what do you stand for nothing. You look at things from a materialistic perspective and thats okay but telling other people who actually have feelings and emotions towards a logo that they are wrong why I think your an asshole.

Or lets pretend that instead of what actually happened Boston had lost its last  games in a row.  They would still be top of the division.  Maybe not presidents trophy favourites but still top of the division.Its not the streak that screwed the leafs.  Its the entire season that matters.  I guess I should expect this from a bunch of people who also seem to forget that its a team sport and that when a goal goes in everybody deserves some blame not just the goalie.  Yes if his glove was just a little higher it wouldnt have but if the winger had put just a little more effort into not turning over the puck the other team wouldnt have got it or the defender had pushed off just a little harder he could have made it back in time or the guy sitting next to the timekeeper hadnt thought it would be a good idea to push that guy into the boards then that goal never would have happened.

His coaching style is pushing archaic and thanks to his leverage we have a contract like Clarksons because hes Randys kind of player.  Orr  Release him to free agency trade him to a minor team for a th rounder  get him out. Really nice guy but hes not a player Toronto needs to tolerate anymore because he doesnt produce much of anything.  Clarkson  I want to think the reason he was so effective in New Jersey was because he played on a line with two allstars Kovalchuk and Elias. When youre on the ice with two guys of that caliber youre not the centre of attention and maybe youll put up some points. Clarkson was front and centre every time he stepped on the ice and his oneonone was mediocre and he couldnt stay on his feet efficiently enough.  Bolland  Unless he signs a contract for lt.m he is not worth the risk no matter where he hopes to finish his career. There needs to be a time where management stops paying out to people who want to fulfill a childhood dream  theyre already in the NHL.  Reimer  You deserve better buddy... Go where fans love you and wont attack your wife on the internet. Im sorry and disappointed that some fans stooped to such a low bearing to say such profoundly upsetting things.

1310566,0,t1_cih11dr,gtThe difference between MacA and Grabo is that MacA was a UFA. He walked away form Carlyle because he could. Grabo went on record saying he loved playing in Toronto. The point was that both got treated like shit by the coach and management despite nationality.  If Grabo was in the same situation as MacA then he would also likely leave considering his comments on the coach despite his love of Toronto.gt I dont think its a coincidence that Grabo MacA and Kulemin soon enough got replaced by blue collar gritty Etobicoke boys like Clarkson and Bolland. The leafs have a lot of Americans and Europeans compared to most teams and have an image of not being that homegrown.  People often say that this is a disadvantage and there is some pressure on the leafs to address this problem.  I dont think that is a great strategy and the best grit players have been JVR Kulimin Komarov etc.  But that doesnt mean that people still dont dream of hometown boys winning on effort.  Maybe Nonis had that as a secondary issue when getting Bolland and Clarkson but I dont think it was the  issue.gtAnd as for Subban yeah got a Norris but along with Kadri his skill and value gets downplayed by a large proportion of fans across the league. I dont think either of them get the respect they deserve.Kadri had one successful year in a shortened season and disappeared for the playoffs.  Expectations vary wildly depending on who you talk to but defensively there is plenty of room for improvement consistency seems to also be an issue.  Its about expectations.  If you think he is potential C then he has a ways to go if your happy with his progress or think he is going to be a good oneway nd line C then great.  This last season he botched his stint on the st line with Kessel and JVR and didnt reproduce the production levels of last year which was to be expected.  Again its about expectationsAlso considering how dirty Kadri is especially this last year Im sure plenty of people dislike him and disrespect him because of that.and I disagree about Subban.  People hate him sure but most of those people would still put him as top  in the NHL among defenseman. His diving drives me crazy but he gets respect as a good hockey player just not as a clean player. Slewfoot and diving galore with him made worse because of how good he is.  The most disrespect I see about him is calling him high risk and from what Ive seen he fits the bill constantly burning his team with bad penalties. ,leafs,cih1zvb,1,t5_2r8hf

1368434,0,t3_29rm9m, JVR  Bozak  Kessel Lupul  Kadri  Clarkson  Komarov  Kontiola  Santorelli  Ashton  Holland  Frattin  Gardiner  Phaneuf  Reilly  Robidas  Franson  Polak Clarkson should be given another shot on the second line and Im sure he will be at least for a while. If that fails we can always throw Frattin up there to see if he kindles something with Kadri. From what I understand Santorelli is no slouch as far as scoring goes so he could even take a shot too. With Noniss comments on the young D stepping up I think hes planning to have Gardiner on first pairing with Phaneuf. Reilly would work well with Robidas for some mentoring and having Robidas on the second pairing would help out Phaneufs minutes. I dont know the deal with Franson yet but I figure Polak will play with him barring a trade. Honestly a line up like that excites me a lot.

Bozak and Clarkson are meant to worry about covering for their linemates so they can focus on their offensive skills they excel at.Sure you might score more on the first line with Kadri at centre but youre almost gaurenteed to be more liable defensively.

If Robidas is healthy he might have an impact but I can already see him getting injured early on this year due to being so injury prone.In terms of our forwards  I assume FrattinKontiola will be sent down. Komarov has heart but I dont think it will translate into any meaningful impact on the ice. SantorelliBoothWinnik will provide much needed depth scoring but they arent game changers.Overall Leafs took a step in the right direction this offseason but I dont see it automatically making us a playoff contender unless everything goes right.

1940548,0,t3_2gw10k,I want to stress that this line up is not what I want the line up to be it is built purely from the quotes and comments made over the past little while from people in the organization. I am only putting together the line up directly as instructed from those comments.Notes based off reported happenings Its been largely reported that Santorelli and Booth will play on the same line. Robidas should be ready for the last few preseason games. Phaneuf should be playing on the left side. Defence should be playing on their appropriate sides. Lupul is looking to be paired with Kessel to spread the offense on the top two lines. Komarov should be getting a more offensive role than two years ago and wont just be kept on the fourth line. Frattin should be starting on the fourth line right wing. Tallinder may potentially be the th defensemen or potentially a Granberg or Percy depending on the training camp. Clarkson will be given every chance to succeed which pretty much means hell be on the second line until he proves otherwise. Based off this the questions that remain Whats the right side Ds depth order? Whos taking the top pairing? The second? The third? How does Franson get played?  Holland on the wing? Does he even make this team? Nylander to the Marlies? Does he get his  games in the NHL before they send him down? Where does someone like Winnik fit in? Who goes out when hes in there? Similarly does a Frattin get sent down to allow for a Winnik or Bodie to stay up?  How long will Clarkson have to prove himself on the second line? Or will they keep him on the third line from the start? Tallinder for the th? Where does that leave Granberg and to a lesser extent Percy? Will Kontiola get the center spot right off the bat or will they throw in a Holland or whomever to center the thirdfourth line?,leafs,ckn15l9,3,t5_2r8hf

2073529,0,t1_cl3dsoe,I answered in the other comment before I saw this  but a couple factors demand yes its still larger in toronto than montreal  perhaps a factor of the economic environment or the population density of the golden horseshoe  more seats much bigger arenaWrong again on the  more  there are platinums in the ACC for   theyre behind the net and in the corners. its just the front row ones that I mentioned that are  and thats only for the super premium games.  and change for the regular games. Its tough to compare apples to apples when they have different classifications and different sections cost different amounts. Both places have the majority of lower bowl seats at about  which is fairly standard for lower bowl in major markets across the league. Im going to a game at MSG on sunday which was  for corner seats  rows up. That is inline with both montreal and toronto prices.The only real price gouge in this case would be the first row platinums  but Im sure you can agree that those dont really have to be attainable  theyre specifically priced out of reach for most people and thats pretty reasonable because theyre the most exclusive seat.

Move lupul up bring down jvr and leivo up from marlies to play that rw. And def need to decide on a dman. If Edmonton is really shopping eberle then we should look to move a dman there plus a prospect of some sort. Anything to make that line produce. We know what the first line  kessel  is.

They know hes as good as gone and we can all see it coming too and Randy can see it too. Imagine your boss at work had had all his buddies fired by upper management in one day and all the guys he loves that work for him but who absolutely STINK at what they do are let go by upper management as well. Clearly youd see the target on his head and youd think less of him. Fire Carlyle and hire practically anyone else to change the leadership of this team behind the bench. Then you make a move involving Kadri Holland Lupul Bozak or any combo of those guys to get a guy to play with Dion and alleviate things not Robidas and try to upgrade at centre. Id even think about moving our first round pick this year to land an excellent young centre from another team. Itd be a tough pill to swallow but Id consider it strongly if we acquire an EkmanLarsson or an Olli Maata to play with Dion then use the st to help acquire a Couturier or a Schenn or a Johansen Ryan Strome or someone similar.

2212634,0,t3_2ke5pd,To me yea I am a Sens fan first there are two main issues in the leaf setup.  Carlyle  st C. The Leafs need to make the choice to land a proper c move Kadri or Gardiner or whatever and go out get an Eric Staal or Joe Thornton whoever just someone that is a solid BIG proven st C. I am not saying empty out the reserves and toss away all prospects but do something. If you put a Thornton on a line with JVR and Kessel the points would be ridiculous.  I havent been able to catch many leafs games yet this year but from what I saw last year and what little I have seen this year guys like Kessel are just not getting the chances often enough. He isnt going to play D or at least not often or well and he needs that C man who can just dish those tasty perfect passed from anywhere.Oh yes and fire Carlyle go get Bylsma sp? or someone who can actually coach and train a damn team. ,leafs,cll2uvt,1,t5_2r8hf

How many times do you see Franson tie his man up behind the net and the leaf player comes and retrieved the puck.The team is a much better possession team with him on the ice. The sheltered garbage is exactly that garbage. He has been started a ridiculous amount in his defensive zone and this year Polak is giving him some relief in that.And thats why I think he looks better to fans  If he doesnt start in the defensive zone as much then the probability is he has less goals scored on him and fans have less chances to poorly unconsciously judge him poorly.,leafs,clyio88,3,t5_2r8hf

Disappeared and worse his teammates adopted his attitude. kessel has freakish talent. Just enough talent to give this team hope.

2740077,0,t1_cnfbqcs,And management didnt believe in tanking  with the picks and without Kessel Burke would have probably more inclined to make other moves knowing the team couldnt go anywhere without roster changes.  I doubt he would have sit on his hands and let the team bottom out if he didnt land Kessel.The team was misjudged but the biggest issue with the trade was the fact that Kessel didnt start the season due to injury and the team was brutal without him  with Kessel the whole season its not inconceivable that they finish above both Edmonton and Florida given their point pace.  Without Kessel but with other roster moves a similar result is definitely possible.  Hell even replaying the season with the same roster you can probably make up  or more points a significant amount of the time due to sheer luck. Finishing one spot higher in the standings takes and their pick goes from being top two . of the time prelottery to . depending on where exactly they finish.A top two pick in  was far from guaranteed.,leafs,cnfj9xz,1,t5_2r8hf

2758698,0,t3_2ro1ub,I like the move. I made a comment about a month ago in reply someone who basically said Horachek is a nobody and shouldnt be the head coach. It broke down why I think he is a good coach and deserves a chance as a head coach on a team with some skill on it.Ill repost the main part of that commentgtThe Florida Panthers fired Kevin Dineen  games into the  season. Dineens record at the time was  thats good for . . Win. Horachek over took the reins of an abysmal Panthers team where their top point producer was Nick Bjugstad with P in G. gtDespite such a poor team to work with Horachek managed to turn them into an overall  possession team during his time as interim head coach. The Panthers went  in G with Horachek good for . . Win. gtThis is incredible impressive when you take into account how bad that teams roster was last year. His Panther team also had an oddly low Shooting on the PP somewhere around . That can be a combination of bad puck luck and not having skilled forwards at your disposal unlike with the Leafs.gtHis Panther team had our number last year winning the season series  GF GA and keeping us to  goal in two of those four games.gtHe also seems to know how to adapt to a changing game and unlikely Randy he believes in balance between all four lines and having all four lines contribute and share ice team.   ,leafs,cnhniv2,15,t5_2r8hf

2799611,0,t3_2s09f7,I think the best Babcock theory Ive heard was on either TSN radio or The Fan  in Toronto where they said Babcock loves winning. Thats what drives him so coming to Toronto seems like a mediocre idea but also a great idea if he can win with this team because if he turned this team into a winnercontender hed be worshipped pretty well. The other thing that may play into Babcock coming to Toronto is the ideafact that Coaches arent paid enough right now in the NHL so if Babcock left Detroit and came to Toronto he could and would according to the radio personalities get paid and raise what coaches get deservepaid in the NHL. This again according to the station from what I can remember would play into Babcocks ego as he would then be remembered as the guy who got coaches what they deserved or at least closer to what they deserve in terms of pay. So he may come to Toronto just to get coaches a raise in what they get paid. I dont think Babcock cares to be a GM. He just doesnt strike me as that type of guy. He seems to be the type of guy who is willing to take any team given to him and find a way to just win with them. So I dont know how much faith Id put in your friends first theory.The second theory has some logic to it but I think the way the Leafs go is they like every other team in the NHL try to get Babcock first if they can ex Babcock doesnt have a contract in place and becomes a Free Agent coach or whatever. If they get him all other ideas die and they move from there. If the Leafs cant get Babcock for whatever reason then they start weighing second tier options of which Id consider your friends  theory one of those options. So I guess well all see how this plays out in the summer but in the mean time it is fun to read theories and give an opinion of how valid they are then coming back in the summer and seeing how right you may have been lol.,leafs,cnmb037,2,t5_2r8hf

2849939,0,t3_2snebo,i love the effort and time put into this post. but no.  Deals like Clarkson are not going anywhere. No one will take these on. And more so they are not going to return anything that is going to help. You also take on the assumption that guys like Jager or St.Louis would even consider TO. I highly doubt it would even cross their mind. They are the point where they are after cups not rebuilds. I think personally TO has the right pieces in most places and a few key missing pieces mostly in the D area. And that is what is scary. Moving Dion could potentially bring in a guy of slightly lesser value but also might make cap space for you to bring in a second guy that is like another Polak. Over all and I have seen it more and more lately it seems like the team doesnt have the right stuff behind the scenes. Nutritionist conditioning coaches etc etc. I see a guy like Lupes how? why? is he injured for so long every season? to me its conditioning I dont think he is exercising or conditioning the right stuff. or enough. Perfect example is Kesler he was an injury machine in Van. Moved over to Anaheim started a new regime and he has been a beast. Kessel is another example sure he is pure god sent talent. but his work ethic is lacking majorly. zero back check and seeming zero energy past the initial rush. all my  cents of course.  ,leafs,cns1cyt,1,t5_2r8hf

Things like this have happened before and they dont ever really make it past the rumour stage but eventually everybody finds out about it through the grapevine.  Gary Leeman allegedly banged Al Iafrates wife back in the s.  Shayne Corson allegedly banged Alex Moglinys wife and Mogliny mysteriously left the team for a couple of days when they were in Calgary I think for personal reasons.  Everybody knows these things happened but theres no proof and nobody really actually knows for sure.  But they sure as hell got talked about a lot...and that was way before the internetforumsetc. are what they are today.As bad as these reporters can get this stuff has literally nothing to do with hockey so they dont touch it.  Its not worth the hit to their reputations to report on something they really cant prove.  Theyll take the reputation hit when it comes to reporting on players inroom activity personalities and other stupid stuff but they still do let the players keep their private lives to themselves.And before someone brings up calling Reimers mother as  douchey as that was remember it was still to ask her about a hockey related injury.And finally using your logic wouldnt you think that media members like feschuk would be more interested in hitting a grand slam and outing a gay player rather than an affair between players and other players wives?  If theyre going to report on players private lives wouldnt you think that would be their holy grail?  These reporters all know which players are gay and they wont touch those stories with a  foot pole.

But to be fair we were talking about Kadri NOT Gardiner.A perfect example of the Kadri hate in media is hereAfter this goal on TSN Leafs Lunch Don Cherry and a few others went on to rip on Kadri because apparently that was a very rookie mistake he made by doing the toe drag goal. They basically said that if he lost the puck there that would have been really bad. For about  minutes they were ripping on him until Jeff ONeil said why cant you just be happy that he scored a pretty goal instead of always bringing up the negative aspects of his game?You may not believe me but just look through the TSN Radio podcasts for the day after that day.Also Don Cherry did the EXACT same thing. He didnt say that was a nice goal instead he said I cant believe he tried that move. Its little things like this that make it seem like there is some sort of racism within the older generations towards him. He is never in talks as being the C in the media.

You only have to watch a few games to see he does possess great skill but I dont always see the hustle in him. The man doesnt even hit. I mean he may be the only north American born NHL player that doesnt hit. Well im sure there are a few others but still throw that body around Phil. Out of everything that has occurred recently the most damning thing to me that Kessel doesnt give a shit is today there was an optional skate and Kessel was no where to be found.

Aside from a team like Edmonton how many places would allow a coach to run his team entirely as he envisions? In addition Im starting to feel that our organization has actually turned a corner with the Shanaplan. We have some reasonable prospects on the Marlies and some higher end ones in Nylander Brown maybe Leipsic and Leivo. While most guys are rd liners or bottom pairing dmen there is solid depth overall that will gradually replace the throwaway NHL team. Add in a bluechip prospect after the draft and the future team begins to unfold. Yes there will be growing pains and it will probably take  years to be competitive our team should be a perennial contender. Even if he goes to a contender hes not guaranteed to win and he will have less control over the teams core.

Now Nash fetched Anisimov Dubinsky Erixon and a st. Lets say NYI wants to dance I hate trade proposals but whatever Im boredId be looking for Ryan Strome a middling prospect and a st  range. Basically subbing Anisimov Dubinsky and Erixon for Ryan Strome and a B prospect. Anisimov and Dubinsky together are good for about  points in a season combined. You mentioned that CBJ wanted those players because they were looking to be competitive AND NYR wanted to shed salary for Nash.The Leafs will want prospects. NYI has a wealth of young players and cap space and dont need to move out roster players to free up cap space.

My grades were good and I didnt go out much.I go into his office and he has a sheet of paper on his desk. He shoves it across the desk and says I want you to take this exam. Your professors tell me youll do well on it and if you do youll get into Harvard or Yale. I look at it and it is the LSAT  the law boards.

4816533,0,t1_cu1nu82,. Adrian Kempe LW Los Angeles KingsAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team MODO SHLPrevious ranking Kempe is an interesting prospect simply because he was two days removed from being eligible for the  draft. If that was true hed have two successful Swedish Hockey League seasons and a topsix performance on the AHL champion Manchester Monarchs by the time his draft rolled around. Hes a fantastic skater with a good skill level but needs to bulk up a lot and work on his defense. Hell need some time but in terms of his play versus men hes certainly on the right track.. Kerby Rychel LW Columbus Blue JacketsAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Springfield AHLPrevious ranking Honorable mentionRychels raw point total of  in  AHL games might underwhelm but as one of the youngest players in the league he was fifth on his team in scoring and second in points per game. Rychels pure skill isnt a wow factor but he certainly makes a lot of puck plays skates fine has a killer shot and a great physical game. Rychel has consistently shown he can be a productive power forward.. Joe Hicketts D Detroit Red WingsAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Victoria WHLPrevious ranking Not eligibleAfter going surprisingly undrafted last year Hicketts went into Red Wings camp and earned an NHL contract. Following that he played his way onto Canadas world junior team as an underage player and was one of the top scoring defensemen in the WHL. Little Joe Hicketts is a great skater who works his rear off every shift is pretty skilled and despite his size makes plays in his own end. Understandably he struggles to win those oneonone battles versus bigger players yet coaches still use him consistently on the penalty kill.. Sebastian Aho LW Carolina HurricanesAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Karpat LiigaPrevious ranking Not eligibleAho consistently has impressed at the junior pro and international levels over the past few seasons. Hes a gifted allaround talent who brings aboveaverage or better speed hands vision defensive play and competitiveness to the table. Despite being somewhat undersized he has always found a way to be a positive factor in every game he plays. He should be a key player in the Finnish Liiga this season and at the world juniors.. Nick Ritchie LW Anaheim DucksAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Peterborough OHLPrevious ranking Ritchie is a big strong winger with standout offensive attributes for a big man. He skates and handles the puck well although not exceptionally well makes skilled plays and has a rocket of a shot. He is very physical with a good work ethic. Ritchie has decent hockey IQ but can force some plays his reads need to improve. His world juniors performance was underwhelming but hes showed well at other levels. Ritchie wont be Anaheims top scorer but he could be a quality topsix forward who adds a physical dimension.. Griffin Reinhart D Edmonton OilersAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Bridgeport AHLPrevious ranking The former fourth overall pick was traded in this years draft as part of a deal that saw the Islanders move up to select Mathew Barzal. The No.  selection was always too high for Reinhart given his limited offense. However hes still a big mobile defenseman with fantastic hockey sense. Hes highend defensively and average offensively which is still a pretty good player. He performed well versus men this season in the AHL and could make the Oilers very soon.. Erik Cernak D Los Angeles KingsAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team HC Kosice SlovakiaPrevious ranking Not eligibleCernak slid to the middle of the second round of this years draft but hes been a firstrounder for me pretty much all season. He has his warts for sure  his decisionmaking needs a lot of work  but hes big a great skater skilled and plays the body. Cernak has also shown a fair amount of success playing versus men and constantly playing years ahead of his age group. I see a player with risk but also a ton of upside and proven ability to play at a high level.. Haydn Fleury D Carolina HurricanesAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Red Deer WHLPrevious ranking Fleurys season was a slight disappointment with his point totals taking a decrease from his drafteligible season  when he was picked in the top . I still think theres a good level of offense to Fleurys game and a game sample isnt totally indicative but hes not a worldkiller in that area. Fleurys skating is elite for a big man and overall he shows the ability to be a bigminutes twoway defenseman. There were red flags raised this season though and the offense and overall consistency in his game have to be pointed out.. Alexander Khokhlachev LW Boston BruinsAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Providence AHLPrevious ranking While his scoring dipped this season he was still the leading scorer for the Providence Bruins. My belief in him has wavered at times and there wouldnt be a spot on this ranking Id be  percent comfortable slotting Koko. However his skill and offensive IQ are very highend and while not the biggest forward hes shown improvement in his play away from the puck. This coming season is huge for Khokhlachev as he has to start making a case to break through onto the Bruins.. Julius Honka D Dallas StarsAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Texas AHLPrevious ranking Not rankedHonkas was one of Finlands best players at the world juniors during his yearold season and hes quite good for a teenager playing in the AHL. Hes not an elite puckmover or rusher but hes very good at doing both. Honkas skating skill vision and shot are all highend. His defense isnt too impressive but hes all right in that regard although his foot frame doesnt help. Hes not too far away from being NHL ready  he just needs to continue to add bulk to his frame.. Ryan Hartman RW Chicago BlackhawksAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Rockford AHLPrevious ranking Hartman was quite impressive as a firstyear pro and hit his stride in the second half with  points in  AHL games after the turn of the calendar. I dont think Hartman is going to wow you with his skill and hes not exceptionally quick but he certainly can create chances and finish. Hes also pretty good defensively and very involved in the physical portions of the game. Hartman earned a brief callup this past season and its not inconceivable to think he could push for a lengthier stay in the NHL in .. Nikolai Goldobin RW San Jose SharksAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team HIFK LiigaPrevious ranking Honorable mentionGoldobin came close to making the Sharks out of camp but ended up being assigned to Finland the AHL wasnt an option due to an overly restrictive agreement the NHL has with the CHL. Golodbin is a treat to watch due to his fantastic puck skills and creativity. He still needs a ton of strength and attention to his game when he doesnt have the puck. He makes you pay attention when he has the puck for a lot of good reasons.. Emile Poirier LW Calgary FlamesAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Adirondack AHLPrevious ranking Not rankedIve probably underrated Poirier over the last year or two and this past season as a young firstyear pro he was so impressive that it really changed my perception of him. Poirier is a highenergy forward who while not a graceful technical skater was one of the more impressive in the AHL in terms of pure speed. Poirier brings aboveaverage skill and finishing to the table and has a highend work ethic as well. Over the past three years hes always been a core allsituations type of player for his team.. Ville Pokka D Chicago BlackhawksAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Rockford AHLPrevious ranking Pokka was part of the Nick Leddy trade with the Islanders. He was quite good in his first AHL season playing in all situations effectively. Pokka is a very intelligent defenseman who moves the puck very well and understands how to position himself defensively pretty well. The physical nature of the North American pro game was an adjustment for him this past season especially given hes not the quickest guy. I think hes close to being NHL ready and given the moves Chicago made this summer the opportunity is there for him to seize.. Ryan Pulock D New York IslandersAge  | Ht  | Wt  |  team Bridgeport AHLPrevious ranking Prior to getting hurt midseason Pulock was performing at the level of some of the top defenders in the AHL while he was one of the youngest players at the level. I dont think Ive ever been truly wowed by a Pulock performance but he has a lot going for him. His offensive hockey sense is highend and his shot is one of if not the best outside the NHL right now. His defense continues to be problematic and while hes not a slow skater an extra gear would be nice. Overall hes a prospect who is trending up and his first pro season was very impressive.,leafs,cu1nw31,15,t5_2r8hf

It was about how people hate Phil Kessel for being a highly skilled player instead of some shitty grinder that everyone liked. It went on to list all the times when Smythe would trade away shitty but loved players for highly skilled but hated players and found tonnes of success.

5386798,0,t1_cw069ru,Wow great explanation. Canada may have more leaf fans than in the GTA because there are other people living outisde the GTA. The GTA is one of the most densest populated in Canada and Ontario contains about   of the population in Canada. It wouldnt make sense to have as of a large following outside the GTA for a team that hasnt been wildly successful anyway so basic common sense says unless your really close to the media influence of Toronto you probably cheer for another team. Like you said theres other people and teams that live in Canada. Barely makes sense for the US to follow them as they have their own team.Really obvious observation but the majority of people who like a team live close to the city as theyre influenced by it. There is literately no basis for your  shit. Id day atleast    of leaf fans live in the GTA because a we dont know every person GTA is a leaf fan but we also dont know how many people really follow the leafs in general. and b Why would the majority of fans of the leafs be outside the GTA when they cant even see them play?

Would the Leafs overpaid for him? Who knows. Would he have signed for a mill less than   years ago? Who knows. Is he grossly over paid?  mill probably not but as a GENERAL rule for goalies going over  mill isnt worth it I dont believe.

I could be wrong here but isnt there something like a below  chance of getting the th OA pick if you finish last? I agree with you that getting a top  pick is not a sure fire thing anymore but Im a firm believer in building a team through high drafting. Hear me out If you think about where do the majority of the most elite players come from? The first few picks in the draft. Sure you have players like Jamie Benn and Henrik Zetterberg and Tyler Johnson who come from other places i.e. Later rounds free agency but those guys are outliers because players in their situations rarely become that good. The skill of the best players in the world is usually identified by scouts before they become old enough to play in the NHL that is why the best players are usually drafted early. I truly think that a championship team in this league needs a major star to succeed and statistically speaking drafting high is the best way to go about achieving that. ,leafs,cxc2e8y,1,t5_2r8hf

He hasnt mastered the SHL and like Nylander has mastered the AHL. He is not the most dominate forward in the SHL. That said yes he is one of the most dominate U forwards Hes also the leading point scorer in the U category.

He has a positive impact on team possession above average primary points per  and is one of the few defensemen that draws more penalties than he takes. Although this is based on limited data from  this chart indicates hes already elite when it comes to making controlled zone exits you may notice another Leaf alongside him at the top see the full article hereConsidering hes only  and possesses all the raw talent needed to take over games Im confident that under Mike Babcock he can develop into one of the better defenders in the game. Other posters here have noted hes already scoring at a high rate despite not receiving much PP time. Imagine his production in a few years when hes getting PP time alongside guys like Nylander and Marner. When elite talent meets elite coaching great things can happen. I cant wait to see him continue to develop under Babcock.,leafs,cz10v11,9,t5_2r8hf

All accounts suggests paraphrased is Other people are backing me up  dont challenge me  Im giving real world examples of my experiences.  I think that counts for something  at least more than what youre offering  nothing...Marner wasnt just tried on center this year he played a bulk of last year at center and he played his best hockey of the year statistically in the playoffs at center not playing with Domi.  And look at team Canadas Olympic team.  We had a ton of Centermen playing the wing.  With the junior team Strome and Point were locks in the top  and Marner has a history playing on the wing with Strome.  That combined with really weak wingers  it makes sense to use him on the top line.  Obviously that line didnt work out but hopefully that makes sense to you..Stop wasting my time throwing out hail marys hoping that you could maybe be a little bit correct.

6321892,0,t3_427gen,Whew this whole goalie thing is a mess. Like who do you gamble on and make the starter? Reimer? Bernier? Looking at career totals they arent that far apart. I think it is possible that Leafs run with  goalies next season but that would mean there is over M tied up just for goal and they would be in the same mess next year if Bernier improves and Reimer regresses. Leaf Management needs to decide who they run with. I think it has to be Reimer even if he does regress a little but thats only based on what Ive seen of his character in the media. He doesnt seem to be a guy that just gives up and he takes responsibility for his poor play and doesnt make excuses like he cant catch a break. This whole thing is a mess.

6322854,0,t3_426y7r,Ive heard an argument that unless its a cant miss prospect like Ekblad or Seth Jones you take a forward in the top  over a highly touted defenseman every time. Goal scorings at such a premium right now its never available on the trade market. You have to acquire when you can and usually thats through the draft with a top  pick.Defensemen on the other hand are almost always available in the trade market. Nick Leddy Travis Hamonic Dougie Hamiltonare all great young defensemen that have become available in the trade market. Teams are usually better off taking the forward with elite offensive talent because thats almost impossible to acquire outside of a top  pick. Top  defensemen on the other hand are much easier to find. Heck were not sure if Hanifins going to be any better than Dermott only time will tell.The bottom line is unless the prospects a bonafide bluechipper worthy of the  overall pick high scoring forwards are usually a much better bet when youre picking that highly in the draft.,leafs,cz8c823,6,t5_2r8hf

6536845,0,t1_czvatdz,Read my post above.Gardiner is elite defensively and in terms of possession. When hes on the ice his team generally controls the flow of play generates more shots etc. He makes everyone hes on the ice with better. He pretty much increased Phaneufs trade value on his own by playing alongside him and making him look good. He doesnt generate points at an elite level but he does alright.Someone else posted his HERO chart which illustrates some of these points nicely.Bottom line is Gardiner is far and away our best defenceman right now. I would argue hes a legitimate top . His detractors often point to the fact that Gardiner makes a lot of giveaways isnt physical or looks too nonchalant out there. These are all invalid criticisms as far as Im concerned. Clearly he doesnt need to be physical to defend effectively and just because he looks nonchalant doesnt mean he isnt working hard or being productive. I also believe that people have a bias when it comes to seeing turnovers. For example Gardiner for some reason has a reputation with our fan base for being making bad giveaways. Dumb fans will actively be looking for Jake to make one turnover and will point to this as evidence of him being a bad defenceman. On top of that giveaways are going to be more common for players who possess the puck as much as Gardiner does. I actually read today maybe in this thread that the players with the most turnovers in the league are guys like Karlsson Subban and Doughty. Its obviously not because theyre bad players but because they have the puck so much theyre bound to turn it over once in a while. The majority of the time theyre making good plays and Gardiner is the same way.,leafs,czvgnpf,2,t5_2r8hf

I have a feeling that Leafs management would be more than happy to give him that as well. At the end of the day he might not have any plans to go anyway. All this might be a ploy by him to just up his value and get TB to dish out more than they other wise would have.

6773933,0,t1_d0j0uba,im saying we shouldnt judge a young guy for maturity issuesarrogance and ceremoniously throw them away asap because of their immaturity breaking into pro hockey. theyre treated like kings in junior hockey and taught that they can do whateveract however and get away with whatever they want. when they get to the nhl they learn thats not the case and things wont be swept under the rug for long if its a pattern of behaviour. seguin and a long list of others learned and grew up. now theyre professionals who dont have off ice distractions or problems that jeopardize their careers. the other example is separate  patrick kane and evander kane if the sexual assault case has evidence should be judged because thats not immaturity thats being a horrific human being. guys like them should NOT be heralded as heroes or idols and celebrated like theyre not scumbags who do disgusting stuff off of the ice despite their talent on it. hosang and seguin  similar because of immaturityarrogance. that will hopefully go away over time under the right influence in the right environment. hell look at jeff carter. he learned to grow up and take his job seriously. now hes one of the best with no off icecharacter issues. sadly the same cant be said for his best friend mike richards but he seems to be doing well right now so good for him. patrick kane doesnt have maturity issues he has serious personality issues and is a scumbags with abusive and violent tendencies. add the other kane to the list if hes proven to be guilty of sexual assault. immaturityunprofessionalism due to sleeping innot taking job seriouslyarrogance vs committing crimes cant be compared. i only brought up seguin vs kanes because certain guys get away with stuff because of their status as superstars while others who dont fit the mold of a traditonal hockey player are treated more harshly and painted as problem children. patrick kane attacked a cab driver while being highly under the influence of alcohol and people still chant his name like some hero during his rape investigation the league and fans continued to celebrate him like a goddamn hero. hosang missed practice and was outspoken about the very real discrimination in hockey where guys dont fit the good old canadian boy image and the hockey world banned together to discredit him and bury him. i downvote things i dont like what you have to say regardless of whether it contributes to conversations or not. thats all i have to say on this matter. have a good day.,leafs,d0k3wk8,1,t5_2r8hf

He never wanted to talk to media and basically demanded special privilege to not have to deal with them while he left everyone else out to dry. Do you honestly think all this shit surrounding him is completely fabricated? Everyone just has it out for Kessel for no good reason? Management traded him away for nothing and gave him no tribute while they are giving Phaneuf one?

But the  year old it is safe to assume will eventually be a better player thus has a higher ceiling or better top end potential for what ever reasons skill speed smarts etc. When some one says ceiling it is simply a way of comparing players who arent in their prime.

I dont think Marner will develop much more if he plays another year of junior and I think management sees that as well. This is a kid that needs to be challenged and start learning how to play against the stronger NHL players.  Ive seen and heard a few people say hes not physically ready but remember he has a full summer to help with that and hes not a player that needs to rely on being stronger.

Hes using it to show how lucky the Leafs have been a reversal of their past misfortune. Stamkos signing in Toronto is very possible and would be almost entirely because of his birth place alone and the Leafs are lucky he was born here.gtThe Stamkos rumors are the product of his Markham Ontario childhood and little else. That both players could possibly figure prominently in this Leafs rebuild is testament to the slowlyreversing fortunes of the franchise mixed with generous amounts of hope and speculation.

This had never happened during any of his past IR stints. Lupul himself wrote a piece for Players Tribune openly questioning if he still had a place in the game after all his injuries and the toll it has taken on him in combination with just aging in general slowing him down while the league as a whole shifts focus more and more towards young speed and skill.Lupul also is likely much more consciously aware of the potential for injuries to impact life after and outside hockey given his own history. There was a time he didnt know if he would ever be able to walk again after his back problems and playing hockey was mostly an after thought. Thats a situation that gives a sort of perspective that most dont have and definitely would be on his mind as he decides how to move forward with his career.I could see the wanting to play with a contender though still making sense in his situation. On a legit contender he would probably play fewer minutes and put less stress on his body which could potentially allow him to play more consistently and contribute in a meaningful way while being less of a risk for his long term health. I do hope if this is true that were able to find a landing spot for him so that he can play in a situation that works for him and that would work quite well for the Leafs to be rid of his contract as well. If that doesnt happen I wouldnt be surprised if he doesnt play this season.,leafs,d4wjau6,1,t5_2r8hf

If we can grab a Provorov Keller Nylander Trouba in the draft we will be pretty damn set. Having said that since were not going to make the playoffs this year it makes so much sense to trade JVR for a couple young players. Yeah JVR is a stud thats why wed get a young high potential player back. Signing him for  million in  years wont make any sense whatsoever.

But then again Kadri had lower quality linemates.So I dont think Kadri is clearly better and I like Kadri. He has an edge that Bozak lacks which I love.

9091353,0,t3_54sjbg,I would go with...LeftWing | Centre | RightWing||JVR|Kadri|SoshnikovMichalek|Bozak|MarnerKomarov|Matthews|NylanderHyman|Laich|MartinThats a pretty competitive roster and Im a big fan of Soshnikovs overall skillset.  He would be a good fit playing shotgun with Kadri and hes got some defensive awareness to boot.  I think Marner would benefit a lot out of Michalek and Bozoak  whereas Komarov would be the anchor to help Matthews and Marner along.   Greening is the odd man out.  So is Rychel and Brown.  Not for lack of merit but I think Michalek will get traded pretty quickly to make room for one of them  and then Greening.  And then the kids will have two extra spots to work with.  Defensive pairings are weird.  But I would go withLeft Defense | Right Defense|Rielly|ZaitsevGardiner|MarincinHunwick|PolakI want Carrick in there somewhere.

They have enough talent on the team and hungry players waiting in the wings to keep that going all year. This may actually improve with young players getting stronger and more comfortable. Where they really need to improve is the defensive side which takes longer to gel. I cant see management continuing with status quo just to get a higher draft pick. At some point theyre going to surprise us with a trade that brings in a veteran D presence that will solidify things on the back end. Its ludicrous to have Hunwick and Polak on the ice when youre trying to hold a lead. Thats just brutal asset management. We need at least one vet to pair with Gardiner when trying to put a game away.

Nylander has actually played better at center than on the wing in the past and Babs is still developing him as a center and having him split draws with Matthews based on strong sides. Marner will end up as on of their RWs likely Matthews in the future. Ideally Kapanen comes as advertised and can slot into the RW with Nylander.

For much of the game last night he led all forwards in ice time until they took the lead and tried to close out a win.  Only Kadri and bozak had more ice time than marner.  I really think when marner gets closer to the  minutes a game mark that other top players get hell be the best scorer in the league.  Hes at almost a point per game now playing with two okay line mates and roughly  minutes a game.  I dont really think hes getting less attention either because hes by far the best player on his line and Im sure other teams know that by now.  As the power play minutes and even strength minutes rise I only expect marners point totals to go up even more.  Hes scored at an extraordinary rate in every league hes played in and hes showing right now that the NHL is not going to be a whole lot different.  I think he has a  point ceiling as of now but if you put up his ice time and power play time as well as playing him with better line mates I could see a ceiling of .  ,leafs,d9x91qd,8,t5_2r8hf

Every year for the last  years people have said Bozak will get worse for one reason or another  the two main ones were Kessel leaving and Bozak aging.Bozak has improved every year in each of those  years and has shown the biggest improvements since Kessel left.All of this is simply to say  I have seen articles like this multiple times a year every year since Bozak fucked up his sophomore season and at the end of each of those years they end up being proven wrong.Also  Fun Fact that isnt meant to corroborate this comment but I enjoy it all the same   Tyler Bozak currently has more points than Phil Kessel this season and throughout his career only has  less points in  less games than James Van Riemsdyk our unquestionable first line winger ,leafs,da3bofd,18,t5_2r8hf

Brutal zone starts and matchups and still comes out on top of possession figures. I have a feeling theyll keep Braun... But you could start next year with RiellyZaitsev  GardinerBraun  MarincinCarrick. Three balanced pairings with complimentary skill sets that can create offense and defend competently.Not sure what the asking is on Braun but he would transform the blue line. And you could still keep Carrick by protecting Fwds Kadri  JVR Bozak and exposing one of Komarov Brown or Hyman.

I dont know as much as them and Im nowhere close to qualified to run the team. But questioning those in power and criticizing their moves prevents them from becoming complacent. If they truly believe they are the best management group and they are the most qualified whats going to make them objectively analyze  every move they make instead of just going with their gut feeling because they know they are the best.

Id legit want to buy one if they werent so bad. Maybe have a group of talented young artists design a couple different ones and when they have their month long ballot voting for all star captains include at the bottom of the page a choice for people to vote on which jersey theyd prefer. At least wed have a say between a few options give them an idea what the public wants going forward AND theyd likely turn over more profit in sales.  ,leafs,dcb4bl4,6,t5_2r8hf

10418223,0,t1_dcoq9y9,Martin is definitely earning his contract. His role isnt to produce scoring and his contract isnt based on how many points he puts up. Players like him are not easy to find. Not only was he on the best forth line in the league last year  and look at the islanders now without those guys but he has laid out the most hits in the league for what?  years in a row now and it currently leading. He is the best player at his position in the nhl. And its a difficult position to define. His off ice presence is almost enough to justify his contract. Hes a natural leader off the ice and he leads by example on the ice. He does that because he more than anyone buys into the style of play that Babcock preaches. And if a guy like him buys in then all the boys will follow.  Teams with as much rookie power as we have need to feel safe on the ice. And nobody in the league provides that better than Matt Martin at least not at his level of play. They cherry on top is that he is only  so he can do for a few years still and In  years when the kids want money he will be the first guy to take a pay cut to win a cup.  And if we do make the playoffs this year he is the kind of player that ups his compete level when the games on the line. Not always by scoring. Hes a huge addition.Just my opinion. ,leafs,dcoz2gv,5,t5_2r8hf

Bozak sosh Zaitsev and hyman were all free agent signings that anyone couldve picked up.

10686947,0,t1_ddi8ywn,Yes possibly hes being sheltered but I think he comes up against those guys during the course of a game more than you think. Games are fluid and coaches dont always get match ups. As far as him being arguably top  on what teams I will list them IMO. Arizona Boston Buffalo Carolina Colorado Dallas Detroit Montreal New Jersey Rangers Ottawa Philly Vancouver. Most of these could be argued either way and maybe throw a couple more in there. I cant speak to match ups and what not for other teams. Also some of these teams have some awesome young guys that arent quite at Gardiners level yet but project to be better. Just think hes major underrated man but I see where you are coming from he has his faults. Hes not a top flight guy by any means but hes a good number  awesome number  guy all around. He also hasnt played with a top pairing guy in his career either and has pulled guys along the whole time that arent his caliber IMO. ,leafs,ddia1o2,-3,t5_2r8hf

10754974,0,t1_ddp97u6,Agreed. Most of the games that went to overtime or a shootout were direct results of blown leads as oppose to mounting comebacks or tying games up late. Even if we only cut our  OTL points in half lets even say  of  when we add those  points to the  points we currently have we would be nd in the Atlantic with  points and  points ahead of both Ottawa and Boston.We have a young team so I dont put everything on the shoulders of our more inexperienced guys. And its easier said than done but having a top  veteran presence on the blue line throughout the season would have obviously been a huge advantage.

G AC seperation stands for Grade  Acromioclavicular AC joint seperation which is characterized by a slight tear or stretching of the AC ligament. Youre definitely not wrong by thinking he could have cracked his collarbone but generally that appears in an xray. MRIs are better to determine softtissue injuries such as muscle ligament or labral damage. With shoulders you have to understand that theyre made for range of motion not stability. Marner is a skinny dude and he likely doesnt have the same muscular stability as some of the more muscular players. Take Sam Bennett as an example. If you saw how skinny he was when he was trying to attempt his famous one pull up you would understand how he was more predisposed to a shoulder separation injury.  ,leafs,ddv84uf,8,t5_2r8hf
10814116,0,t1_ddv94df,I think generally yes its worse but certain stress situations if left untreated can result in irreversible manifestations that require surgery which generally have longer recoveries. Cant really think of any particular examples. But its important to understand that fatigue predisposes one to overcompensation from other musclesligaments thus messing with the alignment. I think Stamkos is a probably a good example of that. Upon his first injury he worked nonstop to get back to health then his team made a deep run in the playoffs which limited his offseason time and then in the offseason he had to start training way earlier than the typical player because of the world cup. In my view part of his injury in november was due to fatigue which enabled him to be put in that awkward position.,leafs,ddveeln,3,t5_2r8hf

Smith Hunwick and Polak arent signed beyond this season so they dont meet the exposure requirements.For defensemen even if Hunwick or Polak were under contract for  wed still have to expose either  or  of Carrick Marincin amp Marchenko we can only protect F amp D OR F amp D and obviously Rielly and Gardiner need to be protected so if Vegas wants a defenseman from us theyll most likely go for a younger option.For forwards we need to expose  players that meet the  requirement. Matt Martin is one of them and Leo Komarov will most likely be the nd. In theory if you really wanted to protect Leo we could extend Ben Smith and play him for  more games and then he could be the nd forward to meet the  requirement. However that seems like a waste of a contract to me especially since at this point Id rather protect Leipsic and Leivo over Komarov anyway.,leafs,ddy6pxg,3,t5_2r8hf

10868826,0,t1_de10dey,gtIf people are willing to just copy and paste the articles every time they are prompted how are we to ever sway people to subscribe? I get that people are either going to buy it or not but I paid to support these guys how are others going to be encouraged to subscribe as well if theres no longer an incentive to pay? Downvoted or not someone will still post the text of the article.The incentive is to support authors you think are worth supporting. Similar to pattern. gtThe thing is with streams some people absolutely cannot get cable like myself at university but we all have internet. In theory I could subscribe to an online streaming service I do I have gamecentre but even then theres local blackouts so the only option is to stream. With the Athletic its different. Theres no blackouts if I have internet and I pay Im entitled to it.There is no difference besides semantics. Your opinion seems to be no one is entitled to the athletics content. This is true. Just like youre not entitled to watch blacked out games just because you have game center. gtEdit I obviously get the case for not removing them people post mirrors and streams to even full online textbooks on this site so to draw the line here is unfair just noting the potential consequences of not having them removed at your discretion.

11037844,0,t1_deibpj0,Personally Id be fine losing someone like Komarov or Leipsic if it meant being able to bring in a RHD like Josh Manson I feel like a JVR for Manson trade makes so much sense for both teams there may be more picksplayers involved but they would be the main pieces.In theory youd protect RiellyGardinerCarrickManson on D then KadriBrownBozakLeivo? I love me some Komarov but Id be fine losing him since hes going into his s. Its also very possible that Bozak gets moved before the expansion draft so the Leafs might not even have to protect him.Long story short Im of the unpopular opinion that its in the Leafs best interest to use the  protection scheme. I think a lot of us forget how many good players are autoprotected Matthews Marner Nylander Kapanen Hyman Zaitsev Dermott Nielsen Horton...sorry had to. That allows the Leafs to take advantage of teams like AnaheimFlorida who need to move a RHD like MansonPysyk and the only thing it would cost the Leafs in terms of who they would lose in expansion is a player like Komarov Leipsic or Rychel. If youre adding what I believe to be a top pairing RHD like Manson thats definitely worth the price and I LOVE Leipsic.Just my thoughts on how the Leafs can use the  rule to their advantage to acquire a top pairing RHD like Manson which I think we can all agree is the biggest hole on the roster right now.,leafs,dej4cbm,2,t5_2r8hf

I think thats one of the reasons a Fehr deal would make so much sense because were in a position where the most valuable player we make available would maybe be worth a rd round pick. We are in a really great spot because so many guys are exempt blessed Zaitsev too. So if we have a player they want anyway Fehr all we have to do is pay the difference in value a th and its a win win.

My point was just that in the race for the Calder Matthews isnt going to get a bunch of credit for doing extra jobs like faceoffs and defensive coverage when those arent things hes done particularly well at an NHLlevel. Scoring is what he has done exceptionally well at an NHLlevel. So whether he wins it or not it will be on the strength of his scoring not the fact that hes performed a few other jobs at an okay level.,leafs,dfli81q,1,t5_2r8hf
