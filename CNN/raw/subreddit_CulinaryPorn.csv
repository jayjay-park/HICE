411289,0,t3_1ysq5f,Roasted Garlic Pizza with Fennel Leeks Enoki Mushrooms Herbs Sprouts and Gruyere Fontina Mozzarella Cheeses.When the toppings are the star I will usually make a very simple crust. A quick and easy pizza dough recipe is here  Roast two garlic bulbs in the oven for  min at  degrees. Saute the chopped leeks and fennel in olive oil.Top the pizza with the white sauce bechamel made with a bit of salt and pepper and a dash of red pepper flakes. Add the cheeses to taste then the roasted garlic cloves and the leeks and fennel. When the pizza is almost done add the enoki mushrooms. Before serving add chopped basil parsley and any other herbs you might like. Finish with a sprinkling of some fresh sprouts. Delizioso!,CulinaryPorn,cfne9wz,4,t5_2swir
