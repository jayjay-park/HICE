Meanwhile people in Bangkok had to tolerate grenade attacks by men in black and the shutting down of a commercial area that was torched afterwards. If these antigovernment protesters start with the same tactics then the same outcome can be expected. ,Thailand,cefcss9,3,t5_2qjw5

Give me a few years and well see .gtIn Thailand Farang are as visible as zebras with their stripes but still about as anonymous as a zebra in a herdOK. On a street like Khao Sarn it might be possible to blend in with the herd if youre here for a short stay as a tourist. But trust me if youre incountry for any length of time people will recognize you they will know you and they will gossip about every detail of your life. Even on a street like Khao Sarn the regulars are wellknown source my wifes family has two shops on that street so trust me they know you even if you dont know them! Some of them may not know your name so if you want to be pedantic about it I guess you could still say youre anonymous. But why quibble about semantics? You know what I mean and you know its true.As for being a public figure. I still get invited to the birthday parties graduation ceremonies grandparent funerals and even weddings geesh Im getting old of students I taught years and years ago. Their current teachers are not invited. Wanna know why? Because they make the mistake of publicly behaving badly. Thats the only sin Thais cant tolerate. Once they do that all those open doors that they probably didnt even know existed close shut for good. Getting invited to these things can be a big deal for Thai people because youre supposed to lend whats know as hai kied to the affair. The higher your status in the community the more hai kied you add to their event. So within my community which is pretty much Bangkokwide at this point Im a public figure. People know me know about me and keep tabs on me. Plus I was very active in floodrelief efforts handing out food with the Army amp Democrats so most people in my neighborhood recognize me from that its pretty memorable to have a farang come by in a boat and hand you some food amp supplies.So in my daily life I literally cannot go anywhere in Bangkok without being recognized by someone. Part of that is because Ive taught thousands of students in my years here and part of it has to do with the particular crowd I hang out with lots of celebs so I get recognized as their friend.My wife doesnt help much either because her comedy Facebook page has almost K likes and Im one of the characters on it so I get recognized from that too. She also blogs about our life on popular Thai forums and so we have a fair number of followers from that too.Other than a few commercials and one movie I havent done very much in media yet. Too busy and not particularly good at it. However whenever I am ready for it itll only take a phone call to a few friends to get my own TV show. So basically I have to live my life now as if I were nationally well known because eventually I probably will be.Quite honestly thats how most farang should live while here because Thailand is literally a place of unlimited potential for us. We can climb up as high as we want to here. There is no ceiling for us. So frankly Im disappointed that most people come over here and squander that tremendous opportunity. Its a damn shame. I think about what the Chinese immigrants were able to do here within two generations in spite of all the obstacles and discrimination they faced and then I look around to see what our generation of Western immigrants are doing here with pretty much a free pass to the top and we just piss it all away doing stupid shit like running gogo bars or buying buffalo for farm girls. Its a damn shame.,Thailand,cenoibl,-3,t5_2qjw5

311325,0,t1_cfcg9u8,uumich gave a really good answer Ill add my c. A few rules of thumb I use in daily life. You dont really wai at a distance. Think of it as a handshake but you dont move in like a handshake of course just do it from where you are making your introduction. Generally the higher you hold your hands the more respect or deference you are showing. I was told once that a fingertips at chinlevel wai was a safe bet if unsure but I think thats kind of crappy I see most Thai people I know doing fingertips at the nose level as a general greeting so thats what I do now. Think of a wai like you would a military salute. You salute superior officers first. If somebody wais you you should return the wai kind of like you are returning the salute. The return can be a low wai or a similarrespect wai or none at all depends on your status levels. Again think of the military salute if a private salutes the general hell probably just get a quick hand lift if anything at all  if a more senior person salutes youll probably get back a more matching salute.Do waiPeople who you are deliberately meeting who arent working for you. As you are coming together to meet and if the other party has seen you a few steps away just put your palms together in front of your face around fingertip to nose for a few seconds. Nearly  of the time you will get a wai and a smile in return or theyve already waid you first and you end up returning it.You should also wai monks regardless of station. But only if your actually meeting together you shouldnt wai every monk passing you on the street. A monk will never wai somebody else its against the rules  you wai them they dont wai you.And you should pretty much return the wai of anybody who deliberately wais you. You dont need to return the wai of every shopkeeper or restaurant hostess or greeter of course  but youre free to give a quick acknowledgement if you wish  you certainly dont have to most people dont.Dont waiShopkeepers taxi drivers bartenders beggars hotel workers etc. Generally the people working for you. You are free to give any of these people a return wai though  or not its up to you.As a tourist there is almost never a person you will meet who you need to wai first. So pretty much dont. It wont hurt you to return the wais of people  but you dont have to do it for everybody. You can get along just fine without waiing anybody! Thai people know that foreigners dont do it so they dont expect it. But it does make people smile when you do it appropriately especially if you catch them unexpectedly.,Thailand,cfd1crk,3,t5_2qjw5

346898,0,t1_cfgoi06,No Farang would have always referred to Europeans rather than to foreigners as it is sometimes mistranslated for example it would never have been applied to Indians or Arabs far more common sights and who themselves wouldve been using the word. I should have specified that earlier. In that regard your  assumption would be correct. Obviously its difficult to track the everyday usage of the word as AFAIK big qualification on this coming later there wasnt much of a tradition of writing down the commoners lives Medieval Latin hardly ever records the commoners lives either beyond the scum are annoying us in a new manner but wonderfully its oddly common in English for our early sources to be about bawdy commonfolk thanks to Chaucer and Shakespeare but I suspect most Thais would have gone their entire lives without thinking about or using the word Farang in the same way that most of us go about our lives without ever bringing up a dodecahedron but for the few who would have found a need for the word the word was there ready for them both when assimilating it from other languages and later on when learning it from the experts. So what would they have used it for if there were no people around to apply it to? Well in the same way that Europeans learned about the goings on in the Indian Ocean through the exaggerated tales of the Arab traders think of tales like the Rok and Sinbad we have to assume there was some curiosity about these foreign lands where goods were being sent to and from. Heres where my knowledge dries up however Ive never heard of a specific story that Thais or other East Asians would have heard about Caroline and medieval Europe I know that the older stories of Greece Alexander and Rome did make it eastward before Farangi the generalised term is thought to have been Rom! but I guess the Islamic world and Asian world were in such better shape culturally and technologically than Europe from the time of the Frankish Empire onwards that perhaps there may not have been all that much to write home about. A Thai or more general East Asian literary historian is probably better to ask for example over on rAskHistorians. ,Thailand,cfgq3dh,1,t5_2qjw5

The Tatmadaw already threatened that it would be very bad for Myanmar people if they amend the constitution which would be necessary for Daw Aung to run. The Tatmadaw has veto power over everything and the roadmap to democracy is supposed to take twenty years so that Daw Aung will never be president and so Than Shwe will not live to see her be president. The junta still runs the country theyre just making a show of democracy because its profitable for them to do so.With that said the Internet in Thailand is much more censored than Myanmar the Internet is wide open and everything from DVB to Facebook to porn is viewable I havent found a single sight in Myanmar blocked.

1596722,0,t3_2ckog8,Your biggest problem is going to be sizing...no not because youre particularly tall or wide Im  foot and a  myself but because Thai sizing is all over the place...literally. First they do cater to farang sizes so at least at your height size if you were  or higher youd have no hope you can buy. With general clothes see if you can try them on even if say with a tshirt its a mater of putting it over what youre wearing. Other clothes department stores tend to be reasonably close with Western sizing Im a  from Robinson with a pair of shorts where as I own a  which fits me well purchased at home from Australia. Tshirts tend to be a size or two up. In Australia Im a SM in Thailand Im generally a Large but that said Ive purchased a Large here that fits me perfectly and another that is a size too big. The hardest one is underwear. I dont know about Department stores but markets do Thai sizes I own XL and theyre tight and I probably need XXL where as most pairs I have from home are SM. It can be pot luck unfortunately but for  baht a pair worth a risk. Buy a pair if it doesnt fit go back and buy another pair a size up or two. Edit typo. ,Thailand,cjgfpj5,3,t5_2qjw5

1630829,0,t3_2czj6r,Its a good choice to go in the low season i.e. before November since hotels are cheaper. On the downside there may be some overcast skies and an occasional downpour. How much time do you have? If its shorter than two weeks perhaps Thailand is too far it takes almost h to get there plus with h time difference jetlag will be massive and airfares too expensive for other lower costs to offset them. For airline tickets use a flexibledates tool like ITA Matrix to find good deals. Where are you departing from in the USA? In general  sounds OK but for say SFOBKK you can find  in September. Theres no need to book a hotel in advance for the entire duration of your stay. Just book it for  nights upon arrival Agoda or Booking.com work well and then either stay or move to a different one. Plenty of vacancies almost everywhere.Pattaya may not be the best choice unless you enjoy people watching and seedy nightlife  tourist trap atmosphere. If you like cheapish beaches Id go to Hua Hin long beach in the city some places south of it maybe Bang Saphpan or an island h from Bangkok like Koh Samet not so cheap though or Koh Chang. Avoid Phuket its way overpriced.If youre not insisting on the beach or have enough time Chiang Mai a town up north is great and hotels are good value up there too. Bus travel is cheap like  baht crosscountry and some buses comfortable use scheduled VIP buses from big stations not agencies. You can save a nights lodging by taking an overnight bus.If low costs are your priority the key is to do as much research as you can upfront and be aware of how much various things should cost. Find out the placesdistances and try to do as Thais do. Do not rely on people who approach you or have interest in taking your money for information  sometimes theyll blatantly lie e.g. that hotel is closed the last bus already left. It is common for clueless tourists to pay  times the going rate for services. Food is usually cheap hotels are a decent value... but local transport taxis tuktuks and tours can occasionally be a snag and cost way over the odds. Do not be afraid to politely bargain or walk away if quoted prices seem high especially for fixedprice tuktukstaxis but hotels can be bargained down too. Supply of almost everything is plentiful the next taxituktuk will usually be along shortly.,Thailand,cjkqbvu,3,t5_2qjw5

1807338,0,t1_ck5z3ma,There are lots of ways around foreign ownership restrictions as well as a couple of treaties that make it possible so I dont see this as big of an issue as it seems on paper.  Also most foreign companies that would be interested in a small Thai startup generally already have a Thai entitypresence that would completely negate those restrictions.  In any case the biggest issue is that it simply is much more expensive to do anything here and it requires a silly amount of red tape.  Thats why the only advice I generally give anyone is to pay the premium for good corporate lawyers that have a good reputation for accomplishing everything in one shot.  It will end up a wash in the end with legal fees as going it alone is something I would not wish upon anyone and often can lead to long delays permit denials poor communication between authorities and applicants and more delays because all thats really required is a filing fee that no one wants to talk about.Of course that is not the case with all things.  Its generally pretty easy to set up a Thai company and its generally pretty cheap.  But there are extra steps needed in order to ensure that for example a Thai partner is limited in their right to do things like sell the company...once the company is set up is when there can be a long list of issues that arise.  ,Thailand,ck6yfu6,2,t5_2qjw5

1843517,0,t3_2fmxfz,Sorry this is a bit insensative but before you choose any course of action Id recommend the following. Make sure she really is pregnant. Simple cheap test should confirm. You say that shes certain but have you confirmed this?. Make sure its yours are you  certain? This may be more difficult to test but widely available in your area. Theres a good reason that paternity tests are so heavily advertised in Pattaya.If you want to abort your only safe and sure options are rather expensive. Either go to one of the few clinics in Thailand that canwill do the procedure others have mentioned a couple of names or fly out to a neighboring country and have it done. If you try to go the illegal route theres a lot to risk. First of course is the obvious risk to your girlfriend  but also with the methods they might use it may not work and they might end up damaging the fetus but not terminating the pregnancy which could end up very badly. On top of that there is no recourse or anyone to hold responsibile for whatever might go wrong. Whatever you choose I would advise you choose one way or another quickly so that the term of the pregnancy does not become an issue.,Thailand,ckbc94s,5,t5_2qjw5

1930063,0,t3_2gkifa,As udisambiguated said I dont know if a backpacking trip across Thailand is a wise idea for your first trip out of the country. Depending on where you are coming from Thailand will probably be a shock to you. It is still a developing country and it can be hard to navigate and unforgiving at times. Also if you get off the beaten path do not expect anyone to speak English or for there to be any resources in English which makes a simple task like buying a bus ticket a difficult affair. You have to realize that its nothing for you to see a restaurant full of Thais eating delicious looking food and realize that because you dont speak or read Thai there is no way you will be able to go in there and eat. A lot of the county will be off limits to you unless you know what you are doing first. Youll be completely fine if you stay down south near all the beach towns. There will be many many foreigners there and there is a lot of things to do and enjoy. Backpacking across Thailand is a different story.Thailand is a country best experienced  at the intimate level and unless you have prior knowledge of the country its culture and its people it will be very difficult to experience that side of Thailand. Unless you know what you are doing so much of the country will be off limits to you. Its not that you CANT backpack across Thailand its that it wont be a good experience. By all means come to Thailand. Its a beautiful country but come here first and get to know the place before you try to venture off the beaten path. You could also find another traveler who has experience with Thailand to help you out. One final thing avoid a backpacking trip during the dry season. ,Thailand,cklrb8p,1,t5_2qjw5

For many decades they preferred power without accountability  control all the essential decisions from the shadows while allowing the weak elected governments to take the blame for corruption poor decision making and such while having only limited ability to govern only when they dont interfere with the shadow interests. Unfortunately the s put an end to this state of affairs and the  coup has not managed to restore it. Thats why they decided explicit power and oppression is preferable for now while they try to stuff the genie of the masses electing politicians that bring some benefits to them back into the box.Old structure doesnt work but maybe theyll find a new way to retain control while preserving the appearance of democracy. Military junta is just a temporary desperate? measure theyre well aware of it.For comparison USA has found a way to get people to feel vehemently support policies against their own interests e.g. be against universal healthcare and for policies that widen the income gap benefitting the  and to channel the votes into two very similar rightwing parties in practice not in rhetoric. ,Thailand,cm5sua4,9,t5_2qjw5

That being said it is a good way to meet Thai people and you can exchange your labor for free accommodation and some food but think of it as you being the beneficiary and gaining experience from them.

4426607,0,t3_3br2sv,I lived on and worked from Koh Phangan for  years. It was ok back then the infrastructure was not so reliable but I think it has gotten better. It is a little difficult to not get caught up in going out to party every night with people from all over the world. It helps if you stay on one of the quieter beaches. There is not much in the way of Buddhist culture and temples there.  I prefer it to Lanta for several reasons better beaches and the fact that most of Phangan is not Muslim for instance. Phangan is probably sketchier though since the local economy is run by mafia families who manage the drug trade which flourishes with the full moon party b.s.,Thailand,csonyh2,1,t5_2qjw5
4432002,0,t1_csoxivf,Not sure how the Marshall plan necessarily led to strong unions but lets consider the Marshall Plan itself...Noan Chomsky Well take any country. There are things which are going to be of some benefit to people. Take the Marshall Plan. Personally I was in favor of it at the time but without illusions. The Marshall Plan was a good thing. It did to some extent help Europe recover but its major goal was for the benefit of US corporate power. And that was barely concealed.I mean remember the situation then. The industrial world had mostly been destroyed by the Second World War. The US which was already the richest country in the world almost quadrupled industrial production. I mean we literally had half of the wealth of the world at the end of the Second World War. US manufacturers had an enormous surplus and they needed a market. Well wheres the market gonna be? Only in the other industrial societies. So they had a real stake in using taxpayer funding to help the other industrial societies reconstruct and be not only a market for US industry but also an area for expansion. Thats how multinational corporations really got started. Incidentally this is not particularly my idea. You can read it in Reagans commerce department which said the same thing. You could read it in the business press which understood it perfectly well. So it was a good thing to do but we shouldnt have any illusions. And dont forget that  billion of the  billion total went straight to the oil companies....,Thailand,cspccao,1,t5_2qjw5

Yeah everything seemingly strung together was a stumbling point for me too as in English there are spaces between the words but in Thai you have to pick out where one ends and the other begins. What youll find with practice is that you start to recognise common words like  and youll scan ahead looking for the end and the beginning of the next word. Context helps a lot too so if its a sentence about studying and you see it becomes faster to parse as you expect the word school to be there.  When I learned I studied the alphabet but it was very slow going in the beginning as I had just arrived in Thailand and didnt know how to speak. And I was memorising indicators of tones... but I really didnt know how those tones were supposed to sound so it was a struggle. Also I was also running into the issue of when practicing alone Id read something but get stuck I wasnt sure if I had read it incorrectly or it was just a vocabulary word I didnt know yet. So after a couple of weeks I stopped learning to read and write and just focused on conversation coming back to reading once I was at a level of basic conversation. For me that made it much faster to pick things up. ,Thailand,cubk8yk,2,t5_2qjw5

5075882,0,t1_cuxojmy,Interesting points. Admittedly Im not as familiar with KL as I am with Bangkok. However I was impressed that you can easily reach both major intercity bus stations Pudu Sentral and TBS on trains. Not the case with Mor Chit despite the misleadingly named BTS station or Sai Tai Mai terminals. You can also reach all the major tourist spots Petaling Bukit Bintang Merdeka square on the train. In Bangkok RattanakosinKhao San are far from any lines. There is no comparison between KTM commuter and SRTrun commuter trains. KTM commuter can be slow but trains are modern and more or less dependable. SRT commuter lines formally exist but run at odd schedules sometimes with up to h between the trains in the middle of the day not just at night. Mahachai line is probably the most reliable running every hour but ends at pm. Not to mention the  yearold nonaircon rolling stock. Its more of a historical reliccurio like Yangons circular line than modern public transit.Utama is in the middle of a gap between two train lines. Ive gone to that area from Sentral and get an impression that geography hills is strongly working against it. Bangkok is all flat and still there are plenty of major outlying shopping malls nowhere near a train line. Im not defending KL here their transport system is far from perfect... but they did have to deal with substantially more difficult terrain and still came up with a system that seems to be a product of some planning and coordination as opposed to Bangkok with its idiotic Mo Chit BTS station nowhere near the main bus terminal with the same name and even more stupidly planned oneplatform Saphan Thaksin station. Also as far as Im aware KL has nothing like those ghastly Hopewellproject remnants. ,Thailand,cuxu2tq,0,t5_2qjw5

For instance for the U.S. you can get a year multiple entry tourist visa I know Thais who got this with minimal process compared to at most  months Thailand on that METV with awful and arbitrary requirements. Its also possible to get a green card which allows you to live and work any job there in perpetuity... yes hard to get but easier than Thai permanent residence which comes with no right to work and requires reentry permits.

6020116,0,t3_3xwzit,Barts NightmareIn the second segment Springfield is held in a grip of terror by Bart who has omnipotent powers. Bart turns whoever is not happy and content with his rule into another being and even history is changed to suit Barts pleasure. When Homer refuses to turn off a football game so that Bart can watch The Krusty the Clown Show which has been running for  consecutive hours Bart transports him into the football stadium in place of the ball for a field goal kick. As Homer creeps back into the house trying to surprise Bart with a blow to the back of the head Bart transforms him into a jackinthebox. Marge suggests that the two see Dr. Marvin Monroe. The doctor says that Bart is desperate for paternal attention from Homer and suggests that the two spend more time together. Despite being a jackinthebox Homer spends quality time with Bart and they soon become a normal loving family. Bart turns Homer back into a human and the two share a warm family moment causing Bart to wake up screaming. Bart and Lisa wake Homer and Marge and beg them to let them sleep in their bed. As the two crawl into bed Homer laments that he has to go to work in a few hours and dozes off becoming the last one in the episode to have a nightmare.,Thailand,cy8rflf,-5,t5_2qjw5

Its a great way to take a tranquil relaxing environment and turn it into a dangerous noisy mess. And in the process it makes it hard for other people to enjoy the beach and the water.The only acceptable way to allow jet skiing is to have a requirement that they operate at least  metres from shore and to have a marked lane through which they are allowed to transit from the shore with a speed limit whilst in the lane.Any operation outside those areas and you are required to be run over by your own jet ski.

I dont think that applies everywhere in the world.  The large majority of college graduates in Thailand do not have functional English aside from a  couple universities.  Its the same in many countries.  Japan China Korea Russia the middle East Latin America etc.  Really aside from north western Europe and Englands former colonies most of the world is pretty shit at English and isnt that interested in it.  Outside of those places I think it is a big mistake to judge people on their ability to speak English.  Definitely should not be making generalizations about an entire population based on the handful of English conversations you have in a tourist area.gtHowever Im not sure Id make the same argument about people in their s or s when learning a new language is far more challenging habits more ingrained and benefits less obvious.Anyone who lives here should at least be able to pick up the basics.  I dont see being over  as being a barrier to that at all...unless you are just so intellectually uncurious andor culturally arrogant that you dont try to.  I know guys in their s that started learning Thai and can hold conversations.  Dont need to be fluent but the benefits of having a bit of Thai are obvious and undeniable for anyone who lives here.  Anyone who just has no interest in trying probably also has zero interest in Thai culture history religion etc. Id argue that the  year old retired plumber here for the cheap sex and sun is probably not intellectually curious at all,Thailand,czlz8fs,5,t5_2qjw5

Also the  first few times I visit a new place I break out one of my fully canvassed bespoke beauties to dazzle them but after they know Im one of the HWBICs I go to my normal dress of jeans.If its for an interview potential job suiting up doesnt hurt.

They even have stupid rules like taxi that picks up customer in Patong to bring them to Karon  about  min journey  cannot pick up a customer for return trip.  Its one of most common excuses they have for high prices... Just never ask them who had that rule put in... Any competing service bustrainuber  either matches those prices or gets legally blocked by tuk tuk friends in high places  if they cannot do that they get blockaded US navy tried to provide its personal their own transport vans to get from Phuket Town to Patong  tuk tuks blocked them in Port and local authorities refused to help  same happened to many cruise lineshotelsresorts or gets a nasty visit. Actually because of tuk tuk blockades a few of the cruise lines that used to come here no longer do   which was a big blow for local economy and US navy have reduced their stop overs here as well though they unlike the cruise lines have never publicly linked that to the tuk tuk blockades  though reduction started happening shortly after so does not take a genius to figure that one out Few years ago someone tried to set up bus route connecting West coast tourist towns  on nd day driver was blocked in middle of road  dragged off his bus by guys carrying machetes and told to quit.

Although technically a requirement youre never asked by Thai immigration vs the airline you fly in on may ask for it. gtIve seen possibly less than reputable sites that allow you to book a temporary ticket or even outright fake oneIf youre really worried use Flyonwards to book a ticket theyre not fake vs actual tickets that you just dont end up paying for. I used this service last year when I need proof of onward travel to apply for a proper tourist visa in Hanoi you get a proper ticket direct from the airline as well. gts it better to be honest and just say we plan on extending it up front?You can try that but ultimately its up to your airline whether theyll accept it or not.

Be careful of the offices and always ask for receipts from them!If youre taking a bus to Mukdahan thats a VERY long ride. So make sure you get a decent bus ticket. The cheapest buses will not have toilets and they might not stop along the way for bathroom breaks. If youre taking flights AirAsia is popular and has cheap tickets but they get most of their money from baggage fees.If youre watching cinemas in Bangkok all movie theaters should have  tickets on Wednesdays. And its easy to slip in your own food and drinks if you have a large purse. But Mukdahan will not have any English movies.

10931234,0,t1_de5hoj5,I lived one block south of Loi Kroh for a couple months at Lanna Moon  I think that was the name and really enjoyed it. Of course if you go on Loi Kroh especially at night you get the catcalls from the women who work at the bars but the surrounding neighborhoods are quiet and close to everything.Walking around and just inquiring at a building that looks good is a great way to go sometimes theyll have an English speakers phone number posted. Otherwise meet and befriend some local expats think teachers digital nomads and ask where they recommend people are always moving and have great insights as to noise levels internet access overall experiences of different buildings.

11022450,0,t1_deha1j9,Capitalism is exploitive in nature. You think regular cabbies arent exploited too? Do you ever eat fast food? Their workers are incredibly exploited. Which makes it also far from perfectBut i hear you. However when the option is no good alternative ridesharing program in place for the majority of the country yet... vs crappy company with a decent product... the choice is clear. Having uber in these areas is still a net improvement. It is a choice between shitty exploitative jobs vs no jobs. Paying into an exploitative system vs driving home drunk. I fully encourage you to install a less exploitable rideshare system for suburban and rural USA though. Treat your employees better than uber and youll take over. Then your argument of boycotts and conscious consumerism has more of a foothold. You need alternative choices for that type of consumer activism to work out positively. ,Thailand,dehd4u5,5,t5_2qjw5

11678863,0,t1_dgjr04f,What you say is all well and good but considering the Thai penchant for corruption in backdoor payments I dont think regulations wouldnt mean a whole lot. I can easily see a restaurant making payoffs to a health inspector just as I do see it done in the building industry to sidestep safe construction standards.To me in a place like Thailand the evidence of my eyes is my best assurance. And a street vendor operating for a while in the same spot with a faithful clientele is the best onthespot assurance that the food is safe and even tasty. Id be less sure if the government told me a restaurant was safe and tasty.I certainly agree that sidewalks should be for walking and not jammed up with a lot of carts and people but then Im not a citizen and the choice should belong to the locals.I really dont think my claim that street food is generally fresh is absurd especially since the locals back me up by long queues at reliable vendors. Ditto in reverse for vendors without customers.And Thai people need cheap nutritious food. Restaurants have a lot of overhead thats reflected in higher prices that many cant pay.,Thailand,dgjtdlg,4,t5_2qjw5

In the high season there are some people there younger than  and Ive always liked the Thais there. Theyre mostly Muslim but youd never know it.But you can rent a motorbike. The coastline is interesting north and south from BS more beaches a few miles of Sahara dunes at one beach some caves one an old monastery...There are only perhaps  people on the beach now low season most are over ...its slooooow. And as I said the expats arent very bright but they are old and and frequently belligerent but grossly drunk so not very dangerous and their teeth fall out when they try to bite you....But I have a few good friends there a decent American guy and a former German girlfriend I still hang out with. And being an olde fart myself I like to hang out after the bar closes at PM in a big hammock under the stars. Theres hardly a sound except the sea no one about few lights the moon is rising the fishing boats are greet dots on the horizon and if Im lucky waves with phosphorescence. The crooked cigarette lends atmosphere....like I said old Fartland.One of the best places to be in the hot season temperaturewise. The trees go right down to the beach huge leafed tall ones that leave you completely in shade and the wind is blowing so its quite enjoyable in your hammock reading a good book. Plenty of ocean pines as well which makes me feel Im on my favorite lake in New Hampshire.The beach is about km from the town. The town is pretty dull too. A few small eating places almost all Thai people. Theres an Italian steel factory  miles out of town which provides most of the work.
