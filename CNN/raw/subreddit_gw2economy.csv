5960343,0,t1_cy0qa6q,This was more or less what I had in mind tbh. Hold a public record for everyone that is willing to invest and for anyone that has already invested. This way you can see the overall health of the fund managers trading activity. ,gw2economy,cy0xjqe,2,t5_2uumj
5978868,0,t1_cy3cqsj,these will defentily go up. Must be people are going back to raiding wvwing running frac and using foods. Supply got cut off at the end of the event. I think the power and condi foods are going to rise the hardest because they are meta atm. well those foods arent but those food effects are meta i think the foods will be a save investment. ,gw2economy,cy3czk7,1,t5_2uumj

9500140,0,t3_5awp0o,You probably should post this to rGuildRecruitment instead. Youre not likely to find anyone here wanting to join a social club for german speaking power traders accepting only k gold playersIn gw trading guilds made sense but they are now completely obsolete up until you hit the  club and hang out in rgwexchangebut even they arent a guild.,gw2economy,d9k3exo,8,t5_2uumj
9676698,0,t3_5d6uo5,Sand jumped in price shortly after the announcement. This is presumably because of the glass and sand visible on the new legendary shield.That said I am not sure how the revamped legendary collection would incorporate these elements. Maybe into the shards?,gw2economy,da5uu8h,1,t5_2uumj
9870239,0,t1_dakd4s1,gt  if you dont mind me asking. how do you refresh the sheet to sort items that are profitable that ive saved? I have around k gold from crafting bifrosts a few months back when the profit was upwards of kk per weapon and experimented a while back with trading a large amount of small profit fast selling items but it was boring as it took a long time to profit for the ammount of time i spent on it. i also have invested heavily before and always made a large profit mostly with millions of candy corn and items linked to legendaries,gw2economy,dau45gj,1,t5_2uumj
