1469621,0,t3_2azjt4,Ive worked with OnGui a bit and its not very intuitive to me.  I bought Daikon Forge GUI on a sale thinking it was the visual workflow I needed but it ended up being too high of a learning curve.Im currently just using the built in UI funtions inside D Toolkit which seems to be working fine for what I need.  It sounds close to what youre trying to do.  D Toolkit is amazing even if Unity now has D integration.,unity,cj0hqlf,1,t5_2qtuh

You made a functioning blackjack game and tons of options for spending your money in other parts of the game.  For a  man  day project I think you did pretty well,unity,cohkxbc,1,t5_2qtuh
