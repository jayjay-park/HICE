8513212,0,t3_4wadap,I mostly go to uocmike s store to buy models along with eBay Mostly at his store.Check what fees your creditdebit card has for international purchases.

9108621,0,t3_54zlfi,I have been trying to decide if space mountain and the fun wheel are worth the cost. Any feedback on those two? I am going to buy  today but not sure about those two. I already have the black pearl and the farris wheel. Looks like the fun wheel is just Mickeys face on the ferris wheel.,metalearth,d86pjp2,1,t5_35mff

10432225,0,t3_5pcrlo,Good idea.  I use a set of drills up to  with many  divisions. I also use dowels cut to  with diameter up to  .  I also have jewelry circle rods some acrylic marblesand anything else that is on the desk to make the right size  Using the drills or dowel if the size is close or correct I roll it on a piece of paper and it will even out imperfections and give you a good round unit.,metalearth,dcqk8we,3,t5_35mff
