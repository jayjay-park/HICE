623348,0,t3_21a3xl,I went through something similar in my final year in highschool. My least favourite part was definitely feeling alone all the time regardless of how many people I was around. In fact being around more people made me feel even more alone. And no one seemed to get that. To be honest Im not entirely certain what advice to give because I ended up not taking my finals and dropping out for the last term. Had to repeat the year after taking that break. But I did want you to know that there is someone right here that gets it. I still dont show people real me and Im probably heading to a similar position again. So Im going to be somewhat genericand I hate it when people give advice like this but I wouldnt say it if I did not believe it to be the solution and suggest that you find someone to help. I didnt and I cracked. I still have problems with asking for help and it may lead to another fall. So I cannot stress it enough. There is without a doubt at least one person that can offer some form of support. I dont know you but I honestly believe that. You just need to find them. Hang in there lt.

743716,0,t3_1zcu2h,Ive always been afraid to cut myself but Ive beaten myself at least since  years old. For me its partially the immediate release due to stress that is commonly mentioned but more than anything it is a feeling that I deserve it and would be a bad person if I didnt take responsibility for the bad things Ive done.The most clear memory was when I was driving back home from a long roadtrip with my grandparents and brothers for the second time. My family always complimented my strength in geography and being able to recognize certain features so when my grandparents asked me when the exit was to get home when I was in st or nd grade I proudly gave an answer which turned out to be one exit short of the proper exit. However they didnt actually take the exit and I thought it was just luck that they happened to miss it. A couple years later the exact same situation occurs but this time I realize that it couldnt be just a coincidence and that my grandparents knew the correct answer the whole time and that they were just trying to make me feel special. I waited until we got home but at some point I went into my room and started crying and beating myself by punching myself around the temples. After refraining from eating television or games for long enough I felt as if I had made up for my arrogance in thinking myself some kind of expert.For me its not really an addiction not something that I just do quickly because of nonspecific stress. Its a way of admitting guilt to myself and trying to right a wrong and the relief of a physical punishment comes much quicker than that of living with guilt. Maybe an even better example was in th or th grade when I was just beginning homeschooling after being expelled for giving a kid a nosebleed and threatening to kill him and going through a lot of issues. At one point I attacked one of my younger brothers and honestly I didnt even feel guilt about it. He told my dad and I was taken into the master bathroom for a belting which was my second belting ever. He held the belt out counting ... ... ... for each tap and when I expected searing pain after the third tap he instead told me Ok youre free to go. At first I was completely confused and just sort of stood around but then he insisted that I go play with my brothers again. It was as if he was rewarding me for something that he considered to be a terrible act of violence on my part. I went to my room and stayed in my bed crying and punching myself late into the night until at one point my dad entered and basically apologized thinking that he had physically hurt me excessively which only made me feel even more guilty he never saw me beat myself or anything fwiw.Maybe it could even be called a kind of selfsacrifice for me the idea that I have to give something up or take pain in order to gain a level of goodness. Not coincidentally I also was a selfdescribed fundamentalist Christian around this time at age  I was already making it to FundiesSayTheDarndestThings and proud of it and a big part of that involved making promises to give certain things up and to accept punishment to absolve myself. For a period things like praying a certain number of times or reading the Bible enough actually substituted for my selfpunishment to an extent. Over time I became less and less religious and once I got back to interacting with real people again college my selfharm started to have flare ups. To be honest I only commit selfharm a few times a year lately in part because I have to admit that I dont feel guilt like I used to. When I do have the urge I may cry for hours still but I mostly resist the motivation to even hit myself even when Im telling myself Just do it and itll be over quick. To be perfectly honest sometimes I wish I could still do it like I used to because I feel like I linger more now but even when Im trying to psych myself into it I just break down and decide that I cant.,selfharm,cgoteu3,1,t5_2rm6q

You shouldnt be held back by your past and I think its great that youre going out and getting yourself back on track. Its good to have cut out all those toxic people who were no doubt holding you back.

1508467,0,t3_2bhdnz,Curious your seeing a Psychiatrist first.  So they will obviously talk to you but at least in the US they have fairly different roles.  A Psychiatrist would generally prescribe you medications such as an antidepressant mood stabilizer etc. I would imagine they would refer you to a Psychologist or Therapist as well which is more of talk therapy.For most of us we have both a Psychiatrist and Therapist.  The Psychiatrist you see on a semiregular basis every month or biweekly depending on circumstances.  Then a Therapist weekly or biweekly generally more often than your Psychiatrist.In either case I would admit your self harm hiding it wont do you much good and they may ask anyway.  But in the end unlike most other treatment plans where your doctor does things to make it better. This really only works if you want it to and are willing to put forth effort to make it work.  As such you should be as honest as possible.  Otherwise you are concealing your problems which then your doctor or therapist is working on incomplete information.I will say Therapy is very hard at first.  There are a lot of very probing questions and you talk about emotions and things that you may have been trying to avoid.  When I get out of my sessions I often feel like I want to cry or just generally very emotionally drained.  And even sometimes Im very triggered when I leave but trust that working through it will make things better in the end.  Being a minor in the US this does get tricky.  Depending on state the doctors can tell your parents everything if they so choose.  Generally they do want to build a relationship with you otherwise you may not be truthful in the future.  So there is a good amount of discretion that most professionals use.  But if they do feel your SH is very dangerous like very unsafe practices or potential for accidental suicide or that you are suicidal then they would almost certainly tell them.  And of course assuming your on their insurance they would see the bill and presumably have an idea of whats going on based on that.  But assuming they dont tell your parents of your SH they may just get a more generic impression that you are depressed or some other diagnosis.  Good luck!,selfharm,cj5d10v,2,t5_2rm6q

NEVER start with your biggest weakness for example a blade Start with things that arent even similar but could produce a similar outcome.  Scissors they are an everyday kind of item that lies around. They are kind of necessary too!  Then slowly progress to having more items but one item at a time exacto knife pocket knife just dont keep it on you and then box cutter i agree as someone said not to put it by your bed but I would say not have have it in your room or bathroom. You just need work on this progression with your tool of choice. Leave it in a drawer where you know it is then try leaving it out in thw open move it around the house.

Now Im pregnant and wondering how Im going to explain to my daughter why mommy has so many big scars. If Id just kept with the short shallow cuts that wouldnt be so much of an issue. I cant hide mine anymore. The worst part about it was I thought cutting deeper and longer would make me feel better. I thought it made me a real self harmer even though I have been doing this longer than some people on this subreddit have even been alive. But it didnt. I was a self harmer before.

2573136,0,t3_2p7dyq,hey so self harm can function like a real bona fide addiction. It can release endorphins in your head so it feels good thus pressuring you to do it more. You probably got that first rush. That it feels good sucks because I havent even cut that much and I still have lots of days where it sounds like a really great relaxing idea which makes it all the more fucked up. The more you SH the more its going to proliferate and become harder and harder to stop because thats how most addictions go. Its hard not to do it but seriously try the best way to avoid temptation is to work hard to not reward it e.g. give in. What helped for me the most was hyperfocusing on drawing when I felt really bad as well as deep breathing to keep myself calm. Writing poetry and getting out of the house also helped a bunch. I also found it helpful to have some object to hold onto extremely tightly when I was out and about to help relieve anxiety. Other folks have found drawing on themselves with markers can be helpful. Good luck friend.,selfharm,cmug3rw,1,t5_2rm6q

Also using that page for reference I suggest putting some triple antibiotic ointment on it then wrapping it lightly with a gauze wrap or giganticnormous bandaid.  Once it stops bleeding that is.

We blame ourselves because it gives us a sense of control to do so. In fact children have no control over their parents but self blame is easier to do than to feel helpless. It makes sense that cutting helps you feel normal its what youve been conditioned to and it allows you not to feel helpless.

6420632,0,t3_43m6oo,I think theres a deeply rooted biological conflict that blocks understanding. Its something that isnt or cant be articulated because its based in the survival part of the brain. Buried deep in the limbic system where people feel more than they can verbally communicate. The core driving force of the human brain is survival. To survive on a very primal level we are driven to seek out three things food safety and sex. These three things are crucial for survival of all life forms. The modern human brain has evolved into something much more complex we still have this primal survival system. Selfharm significantly conflicts with the safety need. Safety is crucial for survival and avoidance of harm is one part of survival. The human brain needs to identify and evaluate anything that can cause harm and remember to avoid it in the future. In terms of physical harm its basically like this thing hurts me I dont like it. Pain and disgust serve to help identify any potential threat. The brains response to pain that endorphin rush selfharmers seek is meant to temporarily ignore the pain and escape the lifeendangering situation. The brainbody is pretty determined to stay alive. People who dont selfharm are instinctually driven to avoid pain and injury. This basic principle is no fault of their own the problem arises from how people respond. Selfharm goes against the brains drive for survival. When people try to understand selfharm they are as many say trying to understand why someone could ever hurt themselves. But this understanding is not so much based on what feelings motivate someone to selfharm. Rather its trying to resolve an inner conflict. Someone who doesnt selfharm is driven to avoid pain so they experience an inner conflict when trying to understand selfharm. They may want to understand may ask many questions but inside they have never felt the drive to seek out pain. The intellectual developed portion of the human brain wants to understand but the primal brain wont allow a true understanding. I think the internal conflict is what causes people to be uncomfortable. I really hope this makes sense my thinking may be a bit wonky as its am here,selfharm,czjfhkw,13,t5_2rm6q

6992879,0,t3_4bgr8v,I dont think I agree with what she said at all. Your feelings are normal at least based on the illness you have and the situation youre in but that does not make them healthy or reasonable.Yesterday I was doing something which got me extremely frustrated and ended up cutting myself. Its not something I do often cutting out of frustration but I know for many people it will be completely normal for them to cut out of anger or frustration at life. Just because its normal doesnt make indulging in it the right thing to do.Im not saying that you shouldnt agree with what she said. The part about feeling upsetdownhurt by living a life you dont want is true for some people but its less true for others. Bursting into tears because you accidentally dropped an egg on the floor is normal for some people but they still deserve help because it is certainly not healthy. Maybe Im misjudging her but it sounds like that might be one of her stock responses to people and certainly having set phrases which are helpful can be useful but its just not something which applies to everybody. The rest of what she said certainly doesnt help with this  her views are unsupported by modern medicine and are an incredibly harmful opinion to vocalise while working at a helpline.

9109643,0,t3_551ud3,I guess the way I see it is this if you are seeking attention its not that youre doing it only for that reason. For many self harm is a cry for help. It definitely was for me on a subconscious level when I first started. Of course that wasnt the only reason but it was one of many. I did always try to cover my arms but I think a part of me always secretly hoped someone would notice anyway if one of my sleeves got pushed aside or the like. This was  years ago now so its hard to say. But youre not entirely in the wrong if that thought crosses your mind consciously or not.gtHonestly should I stop?Personally because I know the hell it causes me now constantly anxious about whether those I interact with in my professional environment notice my scars the neverending urge  and need to fight the urge  to give in and do it again etc I vote yes. If you can stop and find an alternative means like talking to a therapist or even just a creative outlet poetry fanfiction and sketches were my gotos it would be loads better for you in the longrun.

Im thinking about the relationship advice columns from ancient womens magazines for spicing up a sex life which has become boring.  Would any of the suggestions help to revive your interest in cutting?   I guess this would mean varying costumes locations tools scents lighting and maybe doing some role play with yourself.  For specific suggestions Salvation Army shops might be a great place to find bundles of s Cosmopolitan magazine if you can beat the hipsters to them.  How about going selfsufficient and sharpening your own blades maybe as part of the ritual?    Sharpening a knife enough to shave like a not very sharp razor is feasible with practice Ive never tried to go any sharper than that because it makes the edge too delicate.  Im not entirely serious here but Im really worried about you cutting veins doesnt that introduce a bigger risk of sudden septicemia?  People die of that.

Whatever youre feeling to cause you to want to hurt yourself is the reason for it. Doesnt make you a bad person or a strange one. Hell at the very least if youre weird for it then the thousands of us that do it are all weird right along with you That said if you do want to stop now is the time to do it. I cant stress that enough. You can very easily get addicted to it and when that happens its harder to stop than you can imagine. Again look through this sub a huge portion of it is about people talking about how theyve relapsed and how much they hate themselves for it. If you dont ever want to get into that place then just stop where you are and dont do it anymore. I know that may sound tough and Im not telling you what to do but if you dont want to become dependent on it this is the best time to jump off of this train. If you want some specific tips on how to stop there are very useful ones all over the place including in the sidebar. Some people swear by things like holding ice cubes or snapping rubber bands on your wrist. Others think the best way is to just distract yourself with something else you enjoy. It may be hard for you to do that now but I promise you that this is the easiest time to quit that youll ever have. Regardless of if you do decide to stop or not dont forget that you are not alone you are not weird and there are people that care and can help. Come back to this sub whenever you need to. Maybe youre feeling the urge and you dont want to do it. Maybe you need some support some advice. Hell if youre like me maybe it makes you feel good to help people as much as you can. I know it works for me. Whatever happens you can be alright you just have to want it Edit Oh! How could I forget the most important part?I dont know how old you are or what your situation is like but if you want to turn this around and address whatever is pushing you to do this get some help now. Just like with quitting its easier to do it earlier than later so talk to someone. You can get a referral to a psychiatrist or a therapist from your regular doctor. I recommend you go do that ASAP like this week if you can. Just get a medical professional to help you out. Maybe you do have a mental illness that can be treated. Maybe you just need someone with more expertise to give you better coping skills. Either way this is the best way to get help. Do it. It wont be easy but its the best option you have for right now. ,selfharm,dauj1w4,3,t5_2rm6q

How do I do these things?! change topic by asking them question. Playing it off as casually as possible helps too.

10246957,0,t3_5mns7c,This is a very common feeling among selfharmers. I think it stems from the fact that most of us have underlying selfesteem problems and it manifests in insecurity about pretty much everything we do. The irony is that if another cutter tells us to fight the urge warning that the consequences of cutting yourself too deep are too terrible it actually doesnt help because it adds to the drama surrounding the act which is part of why we do it in the first place. The best thing I can tell you is that at every degree of selfharm people experience exactly that feeling that they arent doing it badly enough which shows that it has nothing to do with the actual action and everything to do with the persons insecurity. It also shows that pushing yourself to go further and further will not necessarily make you feel any better or more accomplished. There are many ways of selfharm and they are all serious and worthy of concern. They are all also temporaryfleeting comfort from the underlying emotional problems that cause it. ,selfharm,dc5jsfi,5,t5_2rm6q
10259011,0,t3_5mwo1x,I havent told many people because Ive always hid it well. People most likely wouldnt notice it on their own. So I have always been afraid of how it would affect my relationships or how people see me as a person because I would have had to decide to tell them in order for them to find out. So basically almost nobody knows. But the people who I have told all reacted with strong concern. Like I would never tell someone if I was planning on doing something fun afterward because it definitely sucks some of the joy out of the air. They ask questions too which I answer because removing uncertainty eases people a little and then after a bit its always been okay for me. Like I said I havent told too many people and the ones that I chose were all people who I thought would handle it well but still Ive been lucky. ,selfharm,dc6wyln,6,t5_2rm6q

Many places like lowes or home depot put sand paper near paints and adhesives and stuff. Anyways you can use that stuff to polish away small scratches and fingerprints and stains. Then rub it in some oil to protect the metal. Also dont ever put away wet blades and wipe them after handling them to avoid rust and fingerprints.
