A few days wont kill me.I dumped some XP pots into Luke and Emily they are  now so not far behind where I have Seeley Baggins and Aurai.  Also had a stash of runes and burned my overnight stamina refill buffet and bought stamina and managed to sweep enough to get them both Blue.  My hero levels and overall skills are lower but my power actually went up a little.Ill keep farming for that list you linked and get back to you in a week or three.

6157823,0,t1_cyl7tl3,If youre going by the stated power levels you should ignore them.  It might say the enemy is k and your team is k but you might still be able to take on the enemy.  The silver chalices will upgrade your team  quality stars levels etc  but that wont update the power your game says you have.  Additionally you start out with skills ready to use.  If you interrupt heal and shield at the right time you can reduce the damage you take by a lot.I would say that next time when you feel youll be over powered try doing the fight anyways.  In a worst case scenario your heroes will die but its possible youll win too.,magicrush,cypkwvl,2,t5_37wu2

6341025,0,t1_cza5jq2,Like OP mentioned its more of a hierarchy of needs than one over the other situation especially if you have limited stamina to spare. In the beginning you can do both especially when you need to summon and evolve critical heroes to help you advance in most areas of the game Muse Pulan Sebastian and your main arena team. Or whenever youll only need  SS for the next level. You should always farm for soulstones when you can bec of the limited places you can get them daily limit for sweeping and costly means to refresh elite stages.  And it will pay off in the long run if you invest on the right heroes. ,magicrush,czaek05,1,t5_37wu2

The reason is because the campaign will give you more experience which gives you more staminachances. Also the campaign may give you those runes you are looking for already. Of course if you are at a position where you are about ready to make all your heroes the next level say purple upgrade then focus on getting them to purple and use them to beat people in arena. That will also allow you to advance in arena.,magicrush,czvbduu,1,t5_37wu2

Like myrnym said use resources on your starting squad to get you through the daily activities and such but its not advisable to spend too much of those resources on heroes that wont stick with you in the long run stamina and gold being very important ones to allocate the right way on the stronger heroes.Having Crabbie is a great asset even at level . I made the mistake of investing too heavily in my first star heroes who were Yuan and Russel both of which fell off really badly into higher levels and I could have potentially spent those resources on some longerlasting reliable heroes.But thats how I learned!

6987979,0,t1_d1852u6, TheresaPulanGerberSebastianBlaine team looks solid to me. After you get Jacob you can either replace one of the tanks with him or just keep PulanGerber combo. Youd need to experiment and see what works better for you. Prepurple item passives dont really matter that much. I dont know the exact mechanics but the Guardian Shield gives a pitiful amount of resistance. At the same time the Flame Gem gives better attribute bonuses. Id level Flame Gem for now. I have the Thorny Embrace passive enabled on mine previously I got the Scepter. Yes it works like that. The energy bonuses arent carried to the next battle but the health loses are. So heroes with shieldshealingrevivesummons fare better in this particular game mode. Ive never really used Merlynn with Theresa. If youre referring to health regen from the ultimate keep in mind that Theresa stays at the back row. So when she needs the regen the most chances are the rest of your team has been already wiped out. I suppose it could help against those pesky Smokes. But I keep hearing good things about Merlynn.

Considering the cost of Legendary heroes most players even if they spend on the game cant or wont afford a decent Legendary lineup. This is why the top  players have an entirely different meta than everyone else depending on how many heavy spenders there are.On the top end certainly top  spots and generally top  for most servers Sebastian falls off and I stand by that. Below that I agree that Sebastian does remain at least somewhat competitive depending on the team composition on both sides. When the incoming DPS from the enemy team is so fast and furious that your Sebastian cant even get his ultimate off before he gets blown up then he no longer holds much value which is precisely why I dont run him all that often anymore.,magicrush,d337kch,1,t5_37wu2

I am currently lv almost  I will write down my current lineup and a thought I was having for a couple of days now in my head.I really enjoy TD CD and Abyss. Especially TD. I find it super fun I am regularly doing War Guardian as well of course. Arena and Hero Brawl were my main focus regarding teamcomps due to the fact that I wanted to achieve something. Also my alliance is heavy on World Map war thingies we are constantly battling with the No. Alliance we are No. so I wanted to keep up a competitive team but that does not seem to happen anymore without spending excessive amount of money on this stupidly pbe comptetitive game. So. I am going to stop that and focus on the things I enjoy and try to help out my alliance whenever I can. Here are my current heroes.PurpleMurphy Karna Gerber Mira Coco Pandarus Uther Aurai PurpleYuan Muse Blaine Jolie BlueLufia Diaochan Merlynn Emily Little Red Seeley The others I have are mostly Blue or Green or even untouchedAs followsChavez Crabbie Watson Gearz Gridlock Bedivere Medea Salman Kaiser Luke GorganaI also have Alma at  SS Pulan at  SS.Now I am interested in Lorya too I dont know the viability of hers I just like her concept for maybe a Lorya Uther Muse Merlynn Murphy healdefMR combo or something just be fun.My other thought was an Uther Muse Merlynn Murphy Aurai team for full healsupport fun team haha. I saw a video with this team that had awakened Merlynn I dont know when that happens I am into the idea tho DMy academy is also pretty messed upHP LvAD LVAR LVAP LvMR LvHP LvAd LvAR LvAP LvMR LvNow I dont really know what to do at this point but I think the Bullet time thingy and the whole AD comp wont work. My original concept was to build a team I am using currently maybe switch out Coco for Baggins later at awakening to counter Arielshitcomps with Pandarus and stuff. but that is a LONGSHOT. Baggins awakening is FAR away I do not even own him and I do not even enjoy this concept I was just pushing it due to trying to be competitive but now I lost that motive...eh...So can this be saved somehow? To switch back to AP comp? or something? Must I get Alma to have any decent results? The purple amd purple heroes are all on my level now with maxed out skills and  equipments on each available ones. I was also thinking of getting Pulan for CD using Diaochan a lot I like her a LOT. I also love my Murphy and I wanna give some love to Merlynn so I wanna make teams using these heroes if possible. Of course getting Lorya could be another goal I dont know if it is worth it but Alma will be out of my roster I guess.. takes too much stamina to farm..Any thoughts? I know I am the one usually giving advice I am just a bit confused now due to losing my whole motive behind building my teamcomp.EDIT Forgot to mention that my server has a heavy Magical AP meta with Lilith Ariel Alma in usually every single teamcomp. I do not see Bullet Time yet as the highest guy is lv  on the server.Thank you lt,magicrush,d49iu77,2,t5_37wu2

The bad thing about slow pulses is it gives the enemy more time to sustain themselves if youre not packing enough punch. So yeah it does depend on who else is on your team.

Plus Kong Ming can stun the Boss with his Portal which can delay the Auto Kills as well. None of that is in any way reliable or consistent though.In normal mode Im doing very well with Mira Pearl Rek Gridlock and Baggins.

A week later I got russel. Now I have no doubt that Alma is a great hero even for end game. What Im unsure of is Russel and Muse. Are they any good for arenacrystal dung for a magic based team?This is the list of all my heroes so far. a Yuan. a Uther. a alma. a Emily. a Karna. a Jolie. b Russel. bGorgana. bMedea. b Muse the starting heroesThe ones marked a are the ones that I have leveled so far while the ones marked b are lv.  I have been told that Russel is a bad hero after  and in all honesty I havent found a single team that uses him in the team picker program. Is he still worth leveling at least until I get to that point? lv  troop so far. Also how does he fare in campaign and Crystal dungeon. Albeit having  pretty good AOE heroes Im struggling a tiny bit in crystal dungeon and campaign on certain levels where mages are either banned or have good counters for them.What lineup would you reccomend for a magic based team? Currently farming Pulan  stones he should be a great addition to the team.,magicrush,daocupu,1,t5_37wu2

But yeah the game has a lot of fraud around it typical with a lot of Chinese companies and people should know the truth who they are giving their money to and what they should be expecting from this game especially if they are ready to PP.,magicrush,dfwasni,3,t5_37wu2
11495061,0,t3_63jw3v,My Halley is almost k power now. I am the only one in top  in my merger who uses it. My rank changes between  to . I use halley to great effect combined with Aw. Merlynn and karna. All that healing coupled with her extreme survaviability makes her nigh unkillable.The real problem is vortex is better. So why spend diamonds on halley. Instead vortex is stronger and can fit almost any team comp. ,magicrush,dfyyq4i,1,t5_37wu2

If you cant show pics of the dude buying  usd dias package at dunno  usd or a video of him getting for  usd more than the normal amount of dias.

11684189,0,t1_dgjxhb4,True on my Merger its the same most Kung Fu teams have disappeared Im one of the last survivors and my rank dropped from top  to barely top .Im way more concerned about Zoe being totally crazy than Coco even when im facing her be it with my Kung Fu team or another one.Usually there is  teams without Zoe in top  sometimes one manage to take a spot.In all TOP  there might be  sleep teams and except these only  without Zoe.And there is only  Coco in Top  teams. Its still quite a good position for her but i think it shows clearly that yep shes strong but there are others heroes way more OP than her p,magicrush,dgkf4sn,3,t5_37wu2

11775623,0,t1_dgucs96,No offense you dont know much about awakened karas then. He can do pretty good damage. My alliance friends silver  dot karas k does crazy damage against most teams. I agree Halley hasnt become op but saying A.Karas is zero damage is ridiculous.,magicrush,dguswmh,1,t5_37wu2
11802458,0,t1_dgxu3hi,Its not Coco by her self its the teams she open up. I can kill mid rows before they get to use a skill. They have zero armor. First fight a k Gerber drops nearly instantly. Its a gimmick team yes but its Coco that enables it and it renders sleep teams useless. Even cookie cutter Chavez Blaine Mira Sebastian Murphy is changing Blaine to Coco. No mid row  more damage no more dual tanks pushing through. It feels like its not the meta shifting but all mid row heroes that become obsolete.,magicrush,dgxulgh,4,t5_37wu2
