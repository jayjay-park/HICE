5714733,0,t1_cx5gt0q,But is giving them your trust really wise? When you think about it theyre really the only peoples around here with the kind of tech needed to defeat you. Would it not make sense to join with those who could not backstab you to gain strength in numbers and ensure the Enclave doesnt misuse said tech by obtaining it yourselves?,NorthwestWastelandRP,cx5gvhp,1,t5_3aqho

5893501,0,t3_3vui1h,I begin heading Toward Seatec and see a Small Ghoul Boy Crying over a dead mans body.Is that your pops? I ask him.Yes He answers Killed by some raiders from the southDo you have anybody else to take care of you? I askno he says softly it was just my dad and I since we left Colorado and my mom and grandma were killed by raiders My dad slowly became ghouls walking through the wastes and now Ill probably die all by myself!Hey Grab your things and come with me I dont what the BrotherHoods view on Ghouls is but it can be much worse than just sitting here waiting to die maybe Ill even teach you about surviving.the Young Ghoul looks at me and slowly grabs his things and begins to follow along he pipes up with a quick statement saying my name is Joseph!I reply with Cy but you can just call me Kriggs,NorthwestWastelandRP,cxs67eq,1,t5_3aqho
5932616,0,t1_cxxai6g,He rules from the shadows. He is always this way. He has been busy for a while formulating a grand plan to do what shall be revealed very soon at the meeting. I am perfectly happy where I am safe warm and not dying from raider attacks. A crippling injury stops one from going out on ones own without dying and we Blazers keep a low profile so going out with guards is difficult. I do go out a large amount into New Portland. I dislike your appeal to ignorance thing youve got going on there. Just because you do not know that Ive gone out doesnt mean I havent. Your ignorance has given me many a laugh. I thank you for that.,NorthwestWastelandRP,cxxaoiz,1,t5_3aqho

7046160,0,t1_d1bf85u,Gabriel detailed to Alfonso what he had learned from his reconnaissance. The NCR didnt have the bulk of their military in Oregon but they surely had enough and that didnt mean the NCR wasnt moving more soldiers into Oregon as they spoke. Arroyo was by far the most populated city in NCR territory and most likely all of Oregon. The city had a long history relatively in terms of the Wasteland and was now heavily populated and advanced. However the NCR had been experiencing a rather concerning economic downturn something Gabriel stated was their weak point. As far as telling them anything Gabriel had simply told them of the RNPs presence and remarked that the Northwest Wasteland was wrought with war. He provided the recordings of his conversation with the NCR rangers which he had been recording ever since they had begun speaking.Gabriel agreed to helping them in the future however he also told them of his intent not to leave just yet.These guys are a bunch of dicks Ill tell ya.Count me in this fight.Where do you need me?OOC Apologies for not answering back for a few days hopefully this wall of text makes up for it ,NorthwestWastelandRP,d1f1ghi,1,t5_3aqho
