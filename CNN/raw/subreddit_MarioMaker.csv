4927478,0,t3_3id1nq,I get the defensive attitude to a point because yeah there are some people who are certain the game is already missing too much and dooming it because its not perfect in their eyes. Spoiler Its going to be amazing DLC or not.On the flip side of the coin I dont see why theres so much negative energy associated with DLC. I want the game to be as successful as possible and if Nintendo ever decided to add more styles or pieces to the game Id be thrilled to have more.For example you could easily argue that the focus on having so many Amiibo costumes in a single style is less important than adding more pieces to the entire game. However I also know a ton of people on this subreddit alone seem to love it so I would never suggest taking that away from them. Why not have both?I just dont see why giving more tools has to equal unstable or too complicated. I get that its more development and QA time  DLC lets them monetize and recoup costs for that effort.

As it is thats just a mode that allow the players to discovers random levels while unlocking characters and it should stay as it is and let peoples play as they want to play it.I like challenge so I play Expert mode and I try to pass as little levels as I can but some players just want to play in chill mode and I understand that.But if they add an alternative more competitionbased so yes there such a limit will all make sense.,MarioMaker,cv0xkh4,3,t5_324q9

From what i see there are  ideas here Beetle flying whomps and firebar hopping. Id prefer if you take just  ideas in a level like this. For example i would have liked it if you took the flying beetles that you introduced early in the level and used them again later in the stage more challenging ofc.Anyway it was a very fun run so gave it a star.,MarioMaker,cv15ydf,1,t5_324q9

5107883,0,t1_cv1ojws,I played SMB Underground  Undergarnish. It was an easy course something I could see being in the first world of a traditional Mario Bros. game. It was a decent level but it could stand to have a vertical element. Additionally if you jump off the blue tiles at around the halfway point you can see the top of the pipe.

Maybe a few many different kinds of enemies I think it might have been better slightly more focused but super fun.Classic MB Water Level I really loved this water level.  I dont know if it specifically reminded me of playing SMB but thats not much of a complaint I thought the design here was great!  Excellent use of vines and platforms for aesthetics the level was fun to look at.  Lots of great riskreward setups and I found a secret oneup exactly where it looked like one might be I felt rewarded every time I tried something.  Great level!

5110136,0,t1_cv1yao5,Had a lot of fun on this one. I like what you did stringing together the fireballs. I agree it wasnt terribly difficult. I had a lot of fun playing it though. And towards the end the combo of vertical management thwomps and horizontal management bowser fire added some challenge vs the purely vertical oriented progression of the majority of the level.edit In case youre more interested completed on my second attempt played a couple more times to check out the secret areas. The low one is very tricky and the jump into the pipe for the other as well. This is the kind of level that makes me wish there were big coins included in this game.

5124024,0,t3_3l5htc,Haha my tutorial level has easily the most stars its true. I think its okay to have a mix. I usually end up making  difficulty levels since it achieves a nice balance when what I enjoy tends to be more around the  area. I think including optional challenges in your levels helps. I make it so all my levels have a speedrun option thats a lot more difficult.,MarioMaker,cv3mxwy,2,t5_324q9

5127496,0,t3_3l8c07,I havent made enough levels to have established a style yet. Itll take more time and practice to determine what I gravitate towards.Ive made mostly short levels but a couple decently long levels. Ive made levels in each game style and theme. Not gonna make many water ones though. Ive made primarily platforming levels and primarily enemydriven levels and Ive got a puzzle level idea brewing in my head. Thatll wait until Im home from work to make though. And Im trying to make levels of varying difficulties from the kidfriendly to the expertly precise. But none will be trivially easy or trollishly impossible either.My goal is to play around with a variety of styles and difficulties and eventually settle on the ones that suit my taste best.,MarioMaker,cv420c9,2,t5_324q9

The only bad thing that happened was the beetle shell got stuck between  blocks and the cannon wouldnt fire another one but theres no workaround for that without completely breaking the level and I dont think its something that happens often.,MarioMaker,cv4sf5d,2,t5_324q9

I pushed through it and after many deaths got to the second screen with all the flame sticks and died there. The thought of needing to go through all the burners again just to get another shot at the flame sticks is enough that I had to shut the level off. That first parts just too tedious.If you were to post a new level with that section shortened Id definitely like to play through it.,MarioMaker,cv5ek9p,1,t5_324q9

5158635,0,t1_cv7snce,Thanks for your kind words!  Ill have a look at your levels in a bit.  I was eating dinner.  Ill leave an edit with feedback once Im done EDIT  Jump amp Spin to Win!  Great idea for the level utilising Mario spin mid jump has become such a habit for me that sometimes I struggle with the older games.  Would like to have seen the level be a little longer and ease into it.  Sort of like have a jump where  spin is required and then build to  or a spin to get to  enemies you bounce off or something.  Something to make the player realise how far they can go and how beneficial the spin can be.  Great idea though!Lanky Marios Journey  Im still getting used to the physics of the skinny mushroom and that was the perfect level to teach me.  Good stuff!Im a Squid. Im a Kid.  That was fun but Bowser caught me off guard at the end.  Good idea with the thwomps hitting the item boxes.  Another enjoyable level!Splatoon  Love the underwater theme with the Squds!  Getting the feeling you like splatoon haha.Shoot Em Up  Was a great idea for a level but I think the difficulty was hindered a bit by being able to fly against the bottom of the blocks overhead for the first bit.   Maybe add some spikes there to make it less enticing to go up there.  That would ramp the difficulty up a bit.  Good idea with the clown car though.  Hard to find a way to use it without Nerfing a level too much!Super Mario Underworld  My favourite of the lot.  Great level and could easily be in Super Mario World.  Great stuff!,MarioMaker,cv7t2u1,2,t5_324q9

5161019,0,t3_3lo2lz,Very challenging! Well polished. I was stuck at the munchers for a while I think that part is the most difficult because of the timing of the spin jump but I overall had a good time. Now that I think about it thats actually a perfect spot to put them I might have quit earlier if it was a later hazard.You had good pacing throughout the level with each death trap followed by a moment to cool down. There is a lot of precise jumping but the first walljump section makes a good preview for how close you have to cut things.For the length of the level I feel its a little harsh to not have any super mushrooms for allowing mistakes but if you really wanted a perfect run for this map thats wholly your decision to make. The coins in the beginning misled me for a bit until I found the easy method to cross it. I think you should make it an arc instead of a cluster to be more helpful scratch that Im looking at it again and its fine. That one goomba pipe also got me because of the pipes delay which was kind of frustating after going through a good portion of the gauntlet. I didnt find the goombas all that necessary in the first place kind of just there to fill space.I was worried this would be too much for me after the munchers but I was pleasantly surprised to find a great balance between precise platforming tension and relief when I see my trampoline buddy elevator its way up.Great level keep up the good work.Edit As of this moment Im the only one who beat it.

5212629,0,t3_3mdgwu,This level was pretty damn great! I really wanted it to be longer and have some more challenges but obviously you had to use up a lot of real estate to create the effect.I thought it was very well designed too. The use of the ice blocks to signal where stuff would be was quite clever. The entire level also had a good flow to it even if it was a bit on the easy side. The important thing though is that it was fun to experience.Also that secret room was awesome! Definitely one of the best implementations of a secret that Ive seen. I noticed the pipe down there while swimming and made a mental note but then kinda forgot. After I left that area and started progressing further it suddenly hit me that I didnt check out that pipe. So I backtracked only to find that I couldnt get back up to access it. Not to mention that I could see it from the edge of the screen taunting me. Thats exactly how a secret should be done! I actually ended up dying just so I could go back and see what was in the pipe. It was a great little bonus room very SMWish.Overall I really liked the level and would love to see you make some more in this style to extend the concept. A hard version would also be great.

Levels that dont make me say nope out loud while swiping my game pad furiously to skip in  Mario Challenge.  The raw footage I used for this video consists of me skipping about  of the courses I played usually after my first death. I had to split my one session of  Mario Challenge up into three videos because I felt like one video would be too cluttered. GB of video later.Im just glad that this sub is filled with people like you who appreciate good level design and thats why I rushed to share my video with you guys in the first place.,MarioMaker,cveh0fw,3,t5_324q9

5217129,0,t3_3mgwuj,The level is pretty confusing even for someone who knows the sequence. Figuring out the first part is easy enough but the pipe doesnt lead anywhere new which feels like I wasted my time.The second part is just confusing with that ...sequence. There are  s which could mean I have to figure out the element for N. So the solution for this could either be  because of all the s or  since thats the th element of your Fibonaccisequence.Another thing that I didnt like about the second part was that I had to count indistinguishable pipes while getting harassed by enemies. That can throw the player off.,MarioMaker,cveuucb,2,t5_324q9

Those who like to designplay good high quality levels and those that like more fun absurd levels.Id assume that the latter group is a younger age demographic and follow certain YouTubers closer than the first group. This trend is reflected on the list of top played levels and you can see that the community that is most engaged is the group that likes automario and funny levels or levels that follow a strict theme regardless of quality.However just because this group is most prominent doesnt meant the more mature group of level designers wont disappear they just wont be mainstream.Just my two cents.,MarioMaker,cvgco89,3,t5_324q9

5283302,0,t3_3nc7tk,I played your level and I liked it. There are two parts where I found that your level can be broken. It is where you have the piranha plants set up next to the first helmet. Someone could grab the helmet and use it to kill the piranha plants. This can be fixed by using a helmet dispenser that does not allow the player to grab the helmet.ExampleThe example here is a first attempt I later closed off both ends so that the player could not kick the helmet but at least they are not allowed to pick it up.Secondly if you grab a second pswitch from the pipe you can use it to beat the second boss fight. Which was fine by me because I hated the boss fights. I kept getting squished between blocks. Anyway this can be fixed by using a nonrespawning pswitch over a floor of bricks.Just a thought.Oh and I beat your level without using checkpoints with more than  seconds remaining.If you would like to try my level there are no checkpoints sadly and it is a LOOONG level it is The Puzzle House D.

5297443,0,t1_cvosdhp,I think i would class this as a Hard level in the mid range category what saves this level is that its pretty short. What i would recommend is adding a miiverse comment at the beginning explaining how to do the spinning techniques so newer players have a fighting chance and also mention its a short level so people who dont know wont just skip it. The one thing that did seem out of place was Lakatu and that was the only death that felt a little cheap as it was hard to judge where the spike shells were falling. Lastly i would recommend making a safe zone just after the wall jumping section as a kind of reward for players getting through the first half of the level at the moment its only  block long but if you add a few more blocks there so players can have a breather you will find they will be more likely to try again if they then die afterwards. ,MarioMaker,cvot58d,2,t5_324q9

5309666,0,t3_3nqbii,Every hard level is trial and error. Its either figuring out just the right inputs down to muscle memory or remembering every trap the level throws at you. The latter is usually more annoying and is what most people complain about but that doesnt necessarily make it less legitimate. If a level is predictable as in it behaves the same way every time you play it then by definition its fair and can be mastered with enough patience. Whether its fun to play or not is an entirely different matter.The one exception to this is when Bowser abuse is involved or a lot of enemy spam or spring spam or something else where replaying the level the same way might lead to different results. Then it turns into random chance. That is truly unfair.Ive played fun difficult levels and bad difficult levels. Likewise Ive played fun easy levels and bad easy levels. Quality really has nothing to do with how hard it is or how fair it is.Just keep in mind that if your level is too hard that I cant beat it before I get tired of it Im not going to continue. That doesnt mean you need to change it for my sake but... Im not going to play it. Im not quick to give up either. Ive finished a number of levels where Im the only one who cleared it out of many players. But some are just so out there Id have to dedicate days of training to beat one level.

5315520,0,t1_cvqz9w6,While I do agree with what youve said I do think part of the problem is we look at the levels through the eye of the creator.

Ive gone back to one of my favourite levels and realised where my various flaws were but at the time I was pleased with the results I uploaded it without a second though.Someone else did say they like to finish a level then leave it for half a day or so BEFORE uploading and making sure there arent any glaring issues to resolve which I think is a great idea and will adopt.

5324014,0,t1_cvs4zx1,I love Super Meat Boy. I do not love this course. After the first jumping section I cant get much further. The initial saw is fine but then you have the player jump  blocks to a single donut block with a row of spikes to the right and that alone makes me wanna pull my hair out. But then its the part after that with the opposite running saws. I made it that far about  times out of  and thats monstrously unfair to have to HURRY to a donut block surrounded by spikes then jump  blocks in the air to another donut block and then progress before that saw comes back around. It may seem like no big deal because you get to try that section over and over again in edit mode until you nail it but I have to do the entire level just to hope to get past that one incredibly difficult part. And as is typical with these crazy difficult courses there are no mushrooms for even one second chance and barely any coins. If it had been  Mario Expert I wouldve have skipped it for certain. And wouldve had no fun in the process. ,MarioMaker,cvs7dor,1,t5_324q9

5332354,0,t1_cvt8ao4,gt Death Insurance  gt FEDFgt The idea was to create a challenging level that had no killable enemies and instead focused on things like spikes and fireballs.Yeah I think Im going to quit after that first Kaizo block once I get down to the bottom of the fire stairs. Your level is challenging in the same way Super Pit Fall is challenging. I spent an hour and a half working on someones level that was even harder yesterday with almost no killable enemies but I wasnt constantly being killed by things coming from off screen and it was fun. As far as I got heres the things that made me quit  I made the jump onto the platform which wasnt an easy jump and my reward was being killed by a fireball that shoots up from the bottom while I was focusing on avoiding the cannons. Its easier to go the bottom path because you can stop in a safe place and watch the fireballs and know where theyre going to be and youre not being shot at by cannons. On the moving platforms youre just wherever you happen to be and if youre in the wrong place at the wrong time you get killed by a fireball. Oh you also have to dodge cannon balls. In general if you make a path thats more difficult to access you dont make that path more difficult you give them a reward and either skip them ahead or give them a powerup Then I get to the stairs and a bobomb gets shot directly into me with no warning.And Im not even going to play your second level.

5357119,0,t1_cvwdwyr,Played and left a little picture comment. Very funand I think you did a great job with a tough concept. The early sections are nicely designed to train the player allowing them to get used to the concept in relative safety before it really counts.Ive tried creating this sort of level before so I know that Flying Buzzy Beetles are so hard to use as a platforming elementyou pretty much have to use autoscroll with them or else the way the game loads enemies causes them to load randomly in little groups with huge gaps between them. Difficult to use reliably.,MarioMaker,cvwfl7n,1,t5_324q9

I accidentally dropped one of the p switches in between the spike and flip block but I didnt have normal sized mario.

5380602,0,t1_cvzffmu,I agree with your points. In fact I tested the map without the autoscroll but there was absolutely no sense of urgency and it nerfed the map. And in some places it led to a lot of blind jumps because you werent forced to progress without the scrolling mechanic. I also tested it at faster speeds and it went to a frustratingly Kaizoish difficulty which is what I wanted to avoid.I worked really hard to ensure that this level while difficult could actually be cleared on the first attempt without resorting to trialanderror deaths which I hate.,MarioMaker,cvzfkwi,1,t5_324q9

5394947,0,t1_cw18qpl,I just finished the second one. It is rather challenging. There are some tricky jumps like this where you need to jump through a high hole in the wall. Its easy to go a little too high and bump into the wall above the hole. Add ice and you got a hard jump that most players wont pass in the first try. I fell a few times on the wigglers but I was probably trying too hard to not get hit by the burners.It was a well designed level though. I had fun playing it to the end.

With scrollers nonenemy blocks can crush you so make sure obstacles arent crowded as well. You can see how they balanced that out in the youtube video I linked above.Here is a level that I found in the  Mario Challenge that is similar in spirit to SMB  C. You will notice from the map of the level that it looks like it is pretty empty or plain but once you play it you can see why that layout works so well for an autoscroller.

5458861,0,t3_3ptk06,Ive beaten it  times now and havent skipped a stage yet.  After a while you get used to the troll levels and figure out how to beat them without losing too many lives always check for hidden blocks at the start never take divergent paths unless you cant move to the right anymore treat everything as though it might be a troll if you have a powerup still treat everything as though you would die in one hit dont get tunnel vision play attention to as much on the screen as possible.  If you watch streamers like Witwix or Trihex they also beat it regularly without skipping.I know a lot of people have suggested that there should be a difficulty between normal and expert and I really think thats the best answer.  After watching your video its clear youre good enough to beat Normal no problem but youre making some mistakes you just cant be making if you want to regularly beat expert.  With some practice you should be able to gain lives on stages like Obstacle Course break even on stages like A MazeMerizing Time and lose no more than  lives on a stage like the first one you skipped assuming it didnt get any more ridiculous than the start.,MarioMaker,cw9f6bs,1,t5_324q9

5499014,0,t3_3qavjm,My first level is Spiny Sky Trial.ID DCBBIt isnt that long slightly longer than default iirc. The level requires you to hop on a cloud and reach the next cloud before yours disappears.When building it I wanted the player to be able to see everything coming no cheap surprises. Still there are a loooot of enemies. I mainly use winged spinies but for some reason I felt the need to put fire piranha plants on top of half of them... The biggest problem is that if you are quick you have a relatively easy time since you pass most spinies before they shoot spikes. When you like to take your time however you need to evade all those spikes coming at you. It can get pretty crazy.

5543032,0,t3_3r0tes,A couple of random suggestions Give powerups with moderate frequency unless required. A good fun level will give the player a sense of empowerment without spamming them with so many powerups so as to cheapen their value. Hide secrets that reward a clever player but that arent overly cryptic. Things like get on top of the wall behind a pipe for a Mystery Mushroom of an appropriate character or evade this enemy to get a helmet. Powerups are generally better rewards than stars since they last longer hopefully. Decorate. A ghost house with clocks and lanterns placed in deliberate ways is much more appealing than one where theyre randomly placed. Above all else aim to give the player an experience where if they fail they want to try again instead of give up.Hopefully these are of some use.,MarioMaker,cwk5xa3,6,t5_324q9

5549689,0,t1_cwkx6k3,Thanks for the feedback as for the reply I will just use the costumes in places where youre not suppose to be like in the clouds. Actually I may remove them altogether since thats less design work.For the muncher part I think Ill leave an opening to commit suicide since I realize you stay invincible in the muncher area. Technically youre suppose to bait the Thwomp into the POW blocks to clear the munchers.And finally I know I am not designing professionally like gradually increasing difficulty and subtlely teaching players concepts before adding intense obstacles. My intended goal is to showcase a variety of concepts and themes so players can take them and improve their levels. Each level is suppose to be different and have something Ive found or long for in Mario Maker.So if you manage to make a sideway spring level with a  clear rate let me know and I will play it right away. ,MarioMaker,cwkznvp,1,t5_324q9

5607154,0,t1_cws0yg2,I believe the difficulty was consistent in most of the level. Maybe the secret of the pipe of the first giant plant is too well guarded I believe its a shortcut? so after two tries I avoided it. Good checkpoint placement. Maybe Im just not good enough but I couldnt keep my fire flower very long giant plants kept taking it from me right away after I got it. But at least I had Super Mario instead of regular Mario after dying. It suited pretty well the SMB castle musicatmosphere which I find to bring the most tension. Maybe I missed something but maybe you could add a fire flower towards the end for those of us who actually like killing a boss at the end of a level even if you clearly make it so that it could be avoided.,MarioMaker,cws4e0s,1,t5_324q9

But i would argue that that only worked for mario i cant think of many other game like that besides donkey kong returns because of the immense cultural impact of the originals games so again its really the original games that are the classics,MarioMaker,cww908u,1,t5_324q9

5658479,0,t1_cwyeoc9,For a course designed to show off music that first course had a lot of effort put into it and actually a couple of fun platforming sections. First time in a long while where the horizontal springboard wasnt simply a deathtrap or the beginning of an autostage...Steak and Eggs Expert was great as well though I didnt use Yoshi all that much for as often as his eggs were cooked. A lot of nice platforming segments though if I had to throw a criticism in I think it started to lose steam a little bit toward the end. Especially stuff like the thwomp room after the baby Bowser fight which was very straightforward to get through and just felt kind of there I guess. Not a big deal but it hurt the flow a little bit in a level that I felt was largely well paced otherwise.Good courses though worth the stars.,MarioMaker,cwyhmiu,1,t5_324q9

5691925,0,t3_3t2vlw,The problem with the  star system is that people would give low star ratings for reasons other than bad level design. Water levels would probably get some low stars just because people tend to dislike them. People would also give well designed levels that are too easy or too hard for them low stars. Getting a low star rating would also discourage people from making levels. Someone making their first level might get a star or two in the current system but a . in the  star system. Its also important to remember that companies want people to feel good about their game so they probably arent going to implement a system that fosters negativity. With the current star system its either positive feedback or no feedback.

PBelieve it or not theres already been a few people who have died on the first green koopa and the level is really new. Its intended to show the bounce effect of the shell and that it can be lethal if you dont watch out. Honestly I think it would have almost been easier not to have those blocks there. I do agree that it could have been handled better though. Thanks very much for the feedback Ill be wary of difficulty spikes in the second level and beyond. ,MarioMaker,cxn6vhb,1,t5_324q9

Feels like this should be a level on its own it makes the whole first part of your level seem like filler. I had to download it to beat it.

I know that feeling about wanting to build new levels and also playing others. I always play all the levels of the ones who play mine on reddit and if possible make a video as well. So it sometimes happens that they pile up and I cant build at all D It is fine though. That way I got at least a constant stream of awesome levels.

A few specific things thoughIn some of the levels I was a bit confused as to what some of the aesthetics were meant to represent like the tracks on the pipe in the second level.I liked  a lot and had a little bit more of a theme than the others! Also this level was quite visually pleasing and I like how you used mushrooms for trees. was easily my favourite level I loved the idea you came up with using the bumpers I used them once so far on one of my NSMB remake levels was also quite unique and the way you made the windmills was relatively inventive. was the first time I saw a level that used the PDoor. The beginning was quite interesting with the way you showed the crash but I felt that the boss needed some boss music in the background without it it felt a little odd. The timer mechanism you had at the bottom though was good as it means that you have to fight Bowser Jr and cant escape until the shell breaks the last block.Great work!

6058365,0,t1_cydmhko,But conversely if you want the  trick you could just put it in your level by lowering everything by one block.

6127087,0,t1_cylsr5i,While your levels are clearly thoughtfully designed theyre simply hard in a way that is very unforgiving frustrating and thus not fun enough to keep my attention. If you want to keep it the same difficulty keep it short and sweet between checkpoints so as to make the player want to finish it despite the difficulty instead of giving up. But my main complaints are that theres too much danger especially with the low power up frequency and too many places where its easy to die. It shouldnt be easy to die it should be hard to continue! My favourite of the ones I played was Forgotten Passage as at the beginning it was quite nicely balanced difficulty. I would complain the mushrooms should not be hidden and the jumps should be more lenient particularly with the two pipes near the very start. Also the boos add unnecessary pressure and could do with being a tad more leniently placed. Also the start of The Flying Fortress is incredibly boring on repeated runs as its basically  ? seconds of standing still with slight shuffles. I would try to keep the design coherent with each level focusing on specific mechanics. Often the different parts of the levels felt discordant and it would be better to have a main theme mechanically as well as aesthetically. The aesthetics were very good by the way! ,MarioMaker,cym3407,8,t5_324q9

Great level though! Ill give this one another go tomorrow. Blue block clues the beginning was pretty fun but you lost me in the airship part of the level not quite sure what I needed to do. The parts i did manage to figure out were fun. and . Cannonball climb so both of these are pretty awesome inventive levels.

The checkpoints never looked so good.I think the hardest part was getting comfortable crouch flying but you alleviated that with goback doors. The last bit of the stage im not sure what happened but I managed to hit the P and I just jumped up as high as i could breaking through some blocks to reach the vine.

6185728,0,t1_cysqige,I was referring more to the level layout nearly every section looks copied from another level. Its not just Panga levels Im talking about too parts are taken from a few different popular levels hence why I didnt mention any specific creators. Yeah youre right about shell jumps and other advanced tech being fair game. Those things are just tropes which should be used freely because no one can claim ownership over them. But imo copying layouts from other stages doesnt really make for originalgood levels even if it is one of the hardest stages out there. I get what you mean about it being a tributehomage but even then I dont think that justifies a carbon copy. Tributes and homages should reconfigure and recontextualise elements without explicitly copying them.That said I get it. This is mostly about a  year old kid being able to contend with the very best players and thats a pretty cool thing to see. I have no idea whether a  year old kid could distinguish the line between tribute and plagiarism but I just hope he learns this soon enough especially if this stream gets a lot of traffic and is used as a source of income etc.,MarioMaker,cysr44u,2,t5_324q9

6287717,0,t1_cz4aqcr,In a traditional Nintendo SMW level  Yoshi was usually like a bonus that made the level more fun rather than a requirement to complete the level.So a traditional level would never have a jump where you need to suicide Yoshi because such a jump couldnt be completed without one.Yoshi is fun because he gives Mario a whole new ability set.

6291340,0,t3_41rekw,I disagree with your first rule. If all you care about is stars then that might help you make levels that get more stars. Good levels are not only easy though. Difficult levels are made for the few who can beat it and not the masses who cant.  As such they will have a lower star count because players with less skill are usually unable to recognize when a level they cannot beat is just higher than their skill and not trying to troll them. I have several kaizo levels and many utilize item abuse. My best levels have much lower star count than my easier levels however I consider them to be far better designed and better levels overall.,MarioMaker,cz4r6e0,9,t5_324q9

6299044,0,t1_cz5de4n,I had a similar idea but instead chose to revamp some of my older levels with checkpoints and new features. To me they feel less like their own level and more a shall repeat or copy of something I once made. The fact I havent deleted the previous version also doesnt help. As I said to others Ive had some people play newer versions first and then go back to the earlier ones. Sometimes they acknowledge the growth but Ive also had some comments that point out the similarities.And I do agree with you about the way some people like to label their criticism. As someone who likes to draw in his spare time and I often find part of the reason I lose interest in a level is because Id rather spend the time sketching getting that kind of criticism can be slightly disheartening as well as frustrating.

My World  has a totally arbitrary but interesting name and has like  stars.Also just making your levels pretty helps too. I want my levels to seem like authentic Mario levels so I stay away from the usual semisolid and decoration abuse found in most Mario Maker stages.

Yes it is a spooky level but its my only other Easy rated level with a clear rate of . Mario faces off against an undead army of Dry Bones and Boos riding haunted tanks!

6450669,0,t3_43yt3w,Level Title PEnduranceLevel ID EBDAEDifficulty HardDescription This level is my take on an endurance level. For those that dont know endurance levels are fun levels all about staying alive in one area for a given amount of time until you are granted the ability to move onto the next area. In this one you are dropped onto a tall tower of PSwitches that is  wide. You must survive by jumping off of the PSwitches continuously until two platforms appear at the bottom on either side that grant access to doors both leading to the finish. The idea is that the challenge will dynamically change as you proceed further down the tower. You have  seconds to survive while avoiding piranha plants flying out of pipes fire bars boos on tracks and a monty mole throwing wrenches at you. There should be more than enough PSwitches to allow room for several errors in mistimed jumps or hitting  PSwitches at once. Good Luck!,MarioMaker,czmjgf1,1,t5_324q9

6548774,0,t1_czwofzs,Leaps of faith In the beginning after jumping on the koopa you cant see where youre about to land. When you jump with Yoshi you cant see where youre about to land. When you jump off the conveyor belt you cant see where youre about to land. Other kaizo levels let you see what is ahead.  Forced damage You can get rid of Propeller Mario by simply putting a short ceiling for Small Mario to get through instead of making you lose your powerups as you go along. Kaizo levels do this mostly and when they dont its usually not because they dont want you to have a powerup its because you have to take damage to get through an area.  Enemy placement Sure there werent many but they were hard to avoid and took away from the platforming. Kaizo levels use enemies sparingly. They mostly use them when you need to jump off them.  ,MarioMaker,czwp3in,2,t5_324q9

Its clear that a lot of thought went into each obstacle.At times it did feel a bit sparse. If you dont want to add coins or enemies I think the minimalistic approach you have here works very well for this stage perhaps using the semisolid platforms to fill out parts of the background could make it more visually appealing so that it feels like the stage has more going on.Also at the end I was a bit frustrated to find out that the end was mostly blocked off. I ended up hesitating when I saw that pipe and quite appropriately for the Orpheus myth turned back and landed in a pit missing the platform below it.I enjoyed this course a lot.And thanks for not doing one based on Oedipus.,MarioMaker,czytc6r,2,t5_324q9

For traditional its how can I make this feel like something youd find in an actual game? On the other hand its what can I do thats unorthodox but still really fun and unexpected for players?And as others have said I think the new update will really help make open world levels even more fun. I know its hard to sometimes make something like thats meant to be explored only to have it be optional or even breakable.

I will say though that I think I did a pretty good job adapting the amazing theme from SMDW into Mario Maker.,MarioMaker,d1348o5,1,t5_324q9
6945242,0,t1_d13k9kw,Im still failing to see how allowable frames for a jump from a pswitch is a glitch. If it were a glitch we wouldnt be able to jump off a pswitch at all while activating it.Im hopeful that the change in allowable frames was a biproduct of touching the code in the editor for shaking a pswitch in to a key hence why we did not receive any communication about the change  yet I remain doubtful that the allowable frame change will be addressed and potentially reverted.,MarioMaker,d13knlg,4,t5_324q9

6954856,0,t3_4ayh8y,The primary purpose of a level  is to teach the level the mechanics of the game it should be built assuming the level doesnt know anything about character control power ups death or progression. Usually  needs to teach all these things to the player so they can have fun with future pieces of the game. Mario can jump Enemies kill you in one hit Pits kill you Mushrooms make you biggerOptional advanced things to teach players Wall Jumping  Spin Jumping Grabbing  holding items highjumping off of enemies highjumping from runningReally every level should start by teaching the player the things they need to know to beat that level by showing off the mechanic in a safe controlled environment before twisting it and adding more. One example would be giving the user a starting area with nothing but a small wall in front of them  they cant get past it until they know how to jump.Because of this I would personally hold off ALL advanced elements moving platforms Pblocks enemy enemy harder than a koopa. After all if youre making a  youre probably going to make at least  to  levels in your world probably many more  there will be plenty of time to introduce more complex elements.If you really want to add some complexity you should include more complex enemies or elements in their most basic form. SMW  did introduce the montemole but the first time you saw them they burst out from a wall onto a platform. If you were above them they died instantly  if you were below them you got to see how they move about on the platform above you before they became a threat. Using this really ANYTHING is fair game for a  level... but Id caution you to save the more interesting uses using a thwomp to hit a Pblock using a POW to open a hidden path for future levels.,MarioMaker,d14nzp3,3,t5_324q9

Do not touch the ground or ground pound. You may wall jump as much as you want.  . When you need to crouch mid air after a wall jump start to hold down during the wall slide animation before the jump where you need to crouch  . Jump from the wall  . After a time chosen by you shoot a fire ball. You will be crouching after that fireball animation.Notes  A You can hold down all the time  B  Fireball per wall jump is enough.  C Usually the best time to shoot the fireball is immediately like  frame after the wall jump but that might vary.

7366867,0,t3_4g8yn0,Whats the difficulty?In general with me the harder the course the less stars I get. Also simpler and shorter courses that arent just empty nonsense that kids can enjoy get more stars too on average. Courses where people where people will leave excited comments that they found the Yoshi and such. At least in my experience. If you can also make it a good speedrun course for experienced players all the better.On the other hand while harder courses get less stars they get more loyal players that star more courses as long as I reciprocate.

7408461,0,t1_d2k4uqm,There was some footage shown of the gameplay in a Japanese video. From what I recall the main issues people noticed were the lack of partners lack of experience and usage of paint for attacks akin to stickers. Also Bowser symbols suggest hes the main villian again.The only good thing I saw was that it appears that only paint needs to be refilled while the canvasses you use it on remain in your inventory.

7421866,0,t1_d2lrpfg,What made the boss tricky was getting into the nook with the shellmet. I usually would get stuck on top of the thwomp and never actually bounce into the nook. If I did get into the nook then by the time I got the helmet on the boos were right around the entrance and it was tough to get under them to kill them. I hear you on making things easier. I didnt get to actually watch anyone physically play my levels till I already had about  uploaded. My gamer friends really struggled to beat even my easiest courses. Making traditional courses is the hardest thing for me. If I want to play a traditional course Ill go play a Mario game. The beauty of SMM is that we can make such untraditional courses. When trying to make a traditional course I find myself either totally ripping off a canon level or it devolves into something not traditional. That underground section speaks to that PThe  element course is tense! And yes I did notice the occasional ride along. It happened so infrequently that I wasnt too worried about it. If you need a hint on the puzzle level check out this thread from a few days ago  .I really enjoy wall jumping levels but they usually come with the stigma of being really hard I think thanks to the popularity of super meat bros. I even have  other wall jumping course that flutter between expert and super expert. I wanted this one to be more accessible to less skilled wall jumpers.

This is very good on puzzle or standalone levels that need this mechanic to get through a level.What Im mainly thinking about in this presentation is mainly putting vines in the roof thats not supposed to affect gameplay. Which is used a lot by many of the good makers when it comes to aesthetics even if it really doesnt fit in all levels and even less in almost every level offull traditional games.,MarioMaker,d2v8ch5,3,t5_324q9

7555209,0,t1_d30f5iu,Cool looking level. I liked the use of the rails and the clouds were well placed for the angry jumping wigglers to travel around. The inside areas felt quite fun as well. If I had to complain about something it would probably be that the outside sections felt kind of pointless because several times there wasnt anything rewarding at the top. I did like the use of special coins for secrets.The level was well decorated and I liked the contrast between indoors and outdoors. The vines for making trees was nice too. Definitely good on the aesthetics.If youd like maybe you could check out my level The Ship Above A,MarioMaker,d30zp1f,1,t5_324q9
7555581,0,t1_d2zr73e,I solved the original version. Nice puzzle made me think and I liked it a lot. What was the intended strategy for getting up to the bomb block the first time? I was able to bounce off the shellless koopa to the upper platform so that I could still jump to the lower platform after hitting the Pswitch and retrieving the shell. Alternately I tried using the lower platform first and saving the shell on the upper platform so I didnt have to jump down again but that was a lot harder.For the last part I put the shell where the spring was supposed to go. Instead of putting the spring down I threw it upwards and grabbed the shell before the spring landed.Maybe you could try my puzzle level? Its all in the pipes BFEDAB,MarioMaker,d3117r4,1,t5_324q9

7573953,0,t3_4ivnny,Well so far I must say the intro is a little annoying. Since its a difficult stage dieing will happen often. Having to run through the message at the beginning every time you start over gets old. And then once youre underground the fireballs add randomness to your challenging areas.

7594883,0,t1_d35cvao,Well with recent development in mind they obviously didnt mean to experiment with glitches!

I have no problems whatsoever experimenting without resorting to glitches.,MarioMaker,d35i09p,2,t5_324q9
7595661,0,t1_d35ih9z,I liked this. It had a good traditional feel to it and was fun to play through despite the challenges being fairly simple which isnt a bad thing. I liked the idea of going inside the airship and thought that was handled well.Only recommendation I would have is that some of the cloud platforms seem a bit randomly placed. I guess if you were going for appearance and the idea that clouds would be sort of wherever than I suppose that is fine. But as platforms one or two of those clouds could confuse the player since they did not serve a functional purpose.Edit Looking at snafgurrys feedback below it may appear that we are saying opposite things! But his or her comments did make me remember that the saw section could be potentially be handled better. I would maybe place the mushroom cannon lower as I was having troubles getting the mushroom to spawn but it may work better if it were on the floor. I liked the idea behind the challenge but it was a slight pain getting another mushroom if you did get hurt which slowed things down a little.,MarioMaker,d35l6uv,1,t5_324q9

7654766,0,t1_d3brmpk,I do agree on a lot of the point you have however there are a few cases when a glitch level can be very enjoyable. A good example is CounterStrike Surf. In CounterStrike Source and all games that use its engine like Half Life  there is a bug that allows people to glide on sloped surfaces. After this quirk was discovered people started to make maps that take advantage of the quirk. exampleThese maps became very popular. So much so that they created their own unofficial game mode called Surf. Counter Strike Sources sequel CSGO also allows you to play surf maps as it uses the same engine. This allowed the game mode to become even more popular! So basically I think that if a glitch doesnt affect the game too much and can actually be used to create interesting levels then it would be best to leave it in and not punish people for making levels that use it. However glitches that are just neat visual things or glitches that negatively affect performance are best removed.,MarioMaker,d3cayjl,3,t5_324q9

Your first tip is definitely one I will add to my making process. My two cents Ive been playing Mario for as long as I have been able to hold a controller and I think that for a level to be classic also requires that the player can see the challenge that awaits them and strategize accordingly. The challenge might be very difficult to overcome but its never a blind leap onto a pixelwide platform. Mario knows where hes going before he jumps. ,MarioMaker,d41zyb5,4,t5_324q9
7884497,0,t1_d427kwn,Nice level I really enjoyed the humor! PI noticed its possible to skip the red coins by having Bowser Jr destroy the walls to the locked door and it seemed like the WR holder realized that too. However I figured out a way to sequence break your level further! Letting Bowser Jr destroy the walls like normal I could then take a hit use the checkpoint to become big Mario and through three entrances of the pipe to use up the POW destroy the blocks and catch the shellmet I could then jump up to Bowser Jrs area and force him to destroy the other wall!!!Carloss Total Debacle?

I love having the option too but especially since that update Ive noticed a sharp decline in miiverse comments and feedback overall. Part of that is due to people interacting on social sites such as this one instead which I see as a complimentary service but the rest of it is largely due to the before mentioned speed running new courses and ignoring all appreciation for player interaction and details crowd which is a negative side effect brought on by how the community used a given concept.,MarioMaker,d497kfx,1,t5_324q9

7979156,0,t3_4oincd,Themed overworld maps.By that I mean the maps shown in areas of the game like the  Mario challenge Mario makes his way toward the castle on the map can be themed in several ways.  The map chooses a theme from those tied to levels and assigns a theme to the overworld map. This gives the illusion of a narrative between levels thats sadly missing from the current game in any of its modes.  Level nodes on the overworld map can be visually themed for the levels they contain.  Ghost houses and castles can be inserted as middle and end world bosses instead of what seems to be just castles now.  Players can select a theme for levels to be played in their overworld i.e. I want to play only SMB levels or only Traditional levels or a mix of both and the game will supply those where it can and fill in the gaps as well as it can if not. ,MarioMaker,d4cxkjl,4,t5_324q9

The aesthetics was great as well.The boss fights on the other hand wasnt the same quality in my opinion. The  first and the last one gave infinite items so you could literally not die unless you tried to.Overall I still enjoyed the level a lot for the great autoscroll part so I gave it a star and a comment Id also appreciate if you checked out my newest level.

Disconnect your Wii U from the Internet. Delete all your connection settings so theres no way it can get online. Once youre absolutely sure youre disconnected boot up Mario Maker Go to Coursebot and edit every single one of your levels that has the uploaded flag. Make a small change put a coin or something at the start and then save the course again so that the uploaded flag is no longer present.After youve done this you can reconnect your Wii U to the Internet and launch Mario Maker.

8199817,0,t1_d52i2ph,And to elaborate on the difference soft locks are really frustrating for all skill levels and should be avoided at all costs especially after checkpoints because restarting after a checkpoint will lose the checkpoint progress. If you identify one in your level its usually a good enough reason to delete the level fix it and reupload it unless its a specific kind of level where restarting constantly is the norm like a onescreen puzzle.Locks that dont force restarts are much less of a big deal in hard levels but still something to be avoided if you can in easier levels as its usually pretty trivial to give the player a way to try the challenge again via reset doors or backtracking paths or prevent the lock with design elements like putting lockable areas out of reach of jumps or barring them off with oneway gates bumpers etc. The main thing to avoid is locks that the player cant see until theyre in them as those feel very unfair.,MarioMaker,d52j4e4,1,t5_324q9

I was just wandering over and over until I collected everything. I keep holding power ups as much as I could to see if I need to use them or not. Sometimes I reach a certain area but I dont know if I cheesed or not. Then I go after many obstacles just to reach an obsolete item that it was not needed because I used the one that I had to reach there. I started trying to draw a mental map in my head but I gave up.

So one doesnt necessarily imply the other.But yes you can do either or both as far as finishing on zero and getting a recorded time higher than the levels timer. Im sure its one of those things where there was an easy way to program it and an accurate way to program it and they figured it was going to be relevant so rarely that they might as well use the easy way.I assume there are some speedrun levels that are tight enough that they can ONLY be completed with the timer on zero but I wouldnt know its not really my scene.,MarioMaker,d6xd6q8,4,t5_324q9

Just recycle some assets and throw them into a game to cash in on the th anniversery. If they actually included everything we actually want thered be no reason for Nintendo to keep rehashing the same Mario game over and over with slightly new levels to keep the profit going. If they unlocked the real features and creativity to the consumers people wouldnt need to buy the ned Call of Duty Super Mario game every year.As it stands. Mario Maker is essentially a VERY BASIC level maker to get people excited about Mario. NOT to empower creativity for peoples own games. This game is made for kids to pretend theyre game makers.

8819570,0,t1_d77uds6,My guess is since certain levels wont be compatible they are dropping uploads and direct level codes to obscure the incompatibility.If you could load up a level only for it to tell you its incompatible with your device the game would seem incomplete and pretty much like a scam because you need to get the full version to make use of the actual available features. By cutting it theyre obfuscating this shortcoming but since you cant directly access levels online there isnt a reason to upload levels as you cant share them.They could feasibly have set up ds dedicated servers dividing the player base not ideal only had bookmark support with a special ds icon for compatible levels admitting one version as inferior or transfer levels to upload via wiiu but what theyre offering is technically feature complete.

8972305,0,t1_d7py1th,Yeah I think more objectively that the SMB style strikes a more even balance between player freedom vs. designer freedom than other styles NSMB mechanics might be tough to design around but SMB gives players the least options.While you still get itemgrabbing which adds a lot of depth to the game on its own there are no spinjumps nowalljumps no upwards itemkicks and no airstalls  all things that can break a stage if theyre not designed around them. The Super Leaf is also probably the easiest flying power up to design aroundfor imo.Plus I mean its good nostalgia too.

This idea factors deliberately into the levels design by virtue of the fact that there are very few walkable surfaces present besides yellow bricks which the player is hard locked to spin on to and continually break away as you spin on them and munchers.Additionally enemies like spinies spike tops and thwomps are strategically placed to serve as spring boards to bounce off of and traverse obstacles. The result is a number of unique spinning based challenges which gradually get more challenging. Things get more interesting when cape feathers and fire flowers are thrown into the mix.

9228894,0,t3_56ryyb,Heres a repost of my clarification from last weekJust a friendly PSA about next weeks theme traditional levels  Fifo has put a description in the main post that reads as followsgtThis week levels that resemble levels that could be found on a regular Mario game. No crazy contraptions one screen puzzles experimental levels or any other crazy gimmick. Just good ole traditional platforming action.This comes with a slight clarification  Traditional is different from Classic which is a theme weve done previously. A classic level is always going to be traditional but not all traditional levels are classic. For example you can get away with using amiibo costumes or SMMspecific themes like SMB airship SMB ghost house etc..Ill still be pretty strict in how I interpret this theme but my main point is that some levels which would be ineligible for Classic week could be eligible this week.,MarioMaker,d8ltvzf,1,t5_324q9

9281062,0,t3_57f863, Title  Fire Temple Level ID AADF Description  A huge level with balanced action and puzzle gameplay elements which plays more like a Zelda dungeon. The main gimmick is using lava bubbles creatively in several ways. The action part should not be too hard though offer a fair challenge. The puzzle is not straight forward and requires careful observation and sometimes fast dexterity to solve. Finally a interesting and unique boss awaits you which is showed in the level thumb nail image. It may take more than  mins to clear this level if you dont know what to do at first so I suggest you only try this one when you really want some challenge. Note Keep the fire clown car when you get it. You need it to access the final boss. The last parts use the fire clown car extensively so for those who are not good at control the clown car it maybe much difficult.,MarioMaker,d8sfwpp,1,t5_324q9

Re  I can see what you mean with wanting to make it a bit easier to upload with the challenge  skip. Maybe it could be that you add a one way or some sort of think quick on your feet or you dont get the key  skip again maybe a  way or a wall or something you can only clear while falling. But if you choose not to change it I dont blame you  it may even be good to give the player some options. Re  Sorry! Haha. Yeah you may want to close it off in some way. To be totally honest since I spotted that I dont even know what that section looks like.  By the way did you ever get a chance to check out my level?

9388148,0,t3_59281d,Cute stuff. I do like the visuals. It all looks solid  though I wish for some Calvinstyle grotesque snowmen now and then.A couple of niggles. Im not a fan of the boss rooms which basically involve doing a single simple thing for just a little too long. In the first one you basically just have to stand in place and fire fireballs. Against Bowser Jr you just wait it out atop one of the blocks until he finishes his little shelltantrum between each hit.The spring room also has the issue where if youve hit the spring out of the block and you fail to bring it through the door you basically have to kill yourself. It didnt happen to me but its one of those small things in an otherwise extremely forgiving level where it would feel more solid with a respawning spring. Say let the key door take you into a room where theres a springspawning pipe before you go back out or similar.I did like the challenge immediately after with all the dropping donut blocks. Its the kind of organized mess I like to try to create myself.,MarioMaker,d960inx,1,t5_324q9

9911997,0,t1_dazgy0a,Thanks! I played completed and starred four of yours. Ill be honest that puzzle levels arent really my thing but you had some clever ideas and the hints were clear enough to grasp without being too obvious. Some of the art you made like the Goomba moods was really cool too. You seem to have played through a few more of mine than I did yours so Ill try and level the playing field later on.As for philosophy my levels vary between types although I generally like multiple paths lots of secrets and perhaps a relatively high difficulty level for standard Mario courses. I make a point of trying to make things as fair as possible although the inability to edit published levels without all stars being detached from that level aka putting the republished version at risk of deletion annoys the hell out of me when a player indicates a frustration I hadnt realised as per the image you published of dying next to the Kuribo Goomba pipe in Tick Tock Clock. I think I could amend that by raising the pipe up a block so players would know its not an exit. The inability to make those edits and the star system in general people should be asked to give a star upon completion not have the option shunted off to the side where its easy to ignore and move on are my biggest complaints about what is otherwise an amazing game.Treetop Trail is definitely one of my hardest courses. I went through a phase of creating endurance test levels which are very long and quite difficult but hopefully rewarding once you master them.

Improving on his previous design from Part  the Thwomps can now put out all the fire enemies by moving sidetoside! In this level you must destroy the correct fire enemy which has a key to progress to the next stage. I put some reset doors here and there and added two checkpoints to save your progress.

9957265,0,t3_5i4cvt,Luckily I know a couple of people who will truly look for very well hidden secrets. They make it worth while putting the time into making a multilayered secret.The secrets I like most and like to implement are the ones that you know something is there but maybe not just how to get it quite yet. These may require a cape or Yoshi to be able to pull off. Make something in the design that if someone paying attention will notice it is there for a reason. One of my levels you have to keep Yoshi and the cape to the end. Then you have to fly over part of the level to find the secret. I had to purposely design the entire level around this and I think makes finding it incredibly satisfying. I have played a lot of levels with incredibly deep and satisfying secrets. Many of my levels have them as well.The problem with this game is coming into rewarding the player for finding a secret. I try to make a room that lets you know you found something special. Then give them a powerup they can try to end the level with. ,MarioMaker,db5ggmn,3,t5_324q9

A spiny cap  break bricks above.  Yoshi grab and spit items.  Etc.  Many of the obstacles are borderlineautomatic in nature.  Just remember that enemies mostly Munchers dont react to POW blocks hit from below if theyre not onscreen and touching ground so you may need to hesitate for a halfsecond before hitting a few of said blocks or risk getting crushed by a wall.

10225595,0,t3_5mdnyx,Almost a year.  It encompasses all  of my level slots so part of the effort was just getting  stars through shameless self promotion.I tried to emulate all of the canon Mario games Id played which is most of them.  I also fixed things when people gave me feedback.  I tried to have gameplay and visual variety while making the levels flow nicely.  Some of the limitations of Mario Maker drove my creativity.  Particularly World .  Mine has  Worlds and  bonus world called World .  I wanted to make something the same scale as a retail Mario game you could buy at a store.  Most D Mario games since Mario  are around  levels.  I tried to be generous with power ups before difficult areas.  I also played through it multiple times and shuffled the order of levels quite a bit I didnt make mine in order.  I had an idea for a level and then figured out later how it fit in the grand scheme of things or if I liked how it turned out I decided to do a whole world of them which is how World  became ancient ruins.There were a few levels turned hat were made an cut from the final product.  There are also a few that are in the game but severely altered from their original form with entirely new sections or changed from over world to underground or from NSMB to SMW.I also made a level that serves as an ending cutscenes so that the game doesnt just end anticlimatically when you beat Bowser.  If you have hands you can beat it.  Its easy but it wraps things up.About  of the way through I made a generic themeless  but still fun level to serve as my .I tried to get creative with aesthetics to create settings beyond the ones provided.

10307713,0,t1_dc8c66j,Hey Michael!So I played your course and enjoyed it overall! The aesthetics were really unique and you had quite a few interesting concepts in there like the hidden conveyors and the moving platforms moving Mario and the piranha plants. It was a fun course overall to play and I liked having to run in the middle of mushroom platforms to avoid Thwomps and piranha plants.Near the beginning I found the first Thwomp jump to be just a little tight and I think it would have been ideal if you gave the player just one more tile of space to jump around it.I died once not recorded at the conveyor section as I was not anticipating to get so much momentum off a slight jump which lead to me getting launched into a piranha plant. On the attempt where I beat the level in one run I was able to keep my fire flower which made the section super easy. While I like the idea of having hidden conveyors using faster ones may be a source of frustration for some players. I totally get why you used them I was tempted to hide fast conveyors in one of my courses but the feedback I always received was to slow them down which made the course more enjoyable for others. The faster conveyors near the end are probably fine though when you are just trying to climb the pipe stack as there is only one enemy there.There was also one section after I lost my fire flower that I had no clue how to get past without getting hurt. It was where you have to drop down to a tree to get into the pipe at the end of the section. At the time had no clue how to do that without damage boosting.  Just rewatched the video and you provided a fire flower just before it so I see that the player is supposed to shoot there. I just got hit with something immediately which was unfortunate. Haha.Overall though I absolutely loved the ideas in this one. Enemies on tracks were used well. Kept to a theme that worked. Lots of interesting surprises sprinkled throughout the course and I was very engaged the entire time while playing it.Very well done!,MarioMaker,dccfnxy,1,t5_324q9

On the second screen I would have the first spiny start one block further down just because it isnt that fun to reset with the door whenever your timing is slightly off. The spike trap corridor also seems a bit much to me and is where I threw in the towel. Finally Id like to see more decorative elements on the outside of the path stages that are mostly empty space dont feel as nice! Cant give any feedback beyond those screens bc Im not gud enough haha.Block Breaker is also a good concept but gets repetitive and a tad boring after a while.

11030260,0,t1_dei8biw,Yeah i figured out how to get the sideways springs to move but didnt have time to experiment further Ill get back to it cause its an interesting mechanic if reliably reproduceable.Theres always a level of whats reasonable to expect the player to be able to do. Where you draw the line is the key. My philosophy is that difficult platforming and puzzle solving at least in the vein of OSP should be two different skillsets and overlycrossing the two muddies the water.I play puzzle levels to relax I play platforming levels for excitement. Forcing the two together makes both frustrating and becomes unappealing to me.That being said Sorry to have ranted off. Ive played a few puzzles recently that made you have to do silly stuff because the puzzle itself wasnt very hard. So it fell short of what i was expecting but i couldnt simply clear it cause there was unfair platforming which also isnt what I wanted to be doing. And instead of taking the time to sludge through the platforming which Im more than willing to do on Platforming and Kaizo stages I would skip out inflating the creators sense that they had created a good challenging level when it simply didnt meet the critera of being interesting or engaging.,MarioMaker,dei96ok,2,t5_324q9
