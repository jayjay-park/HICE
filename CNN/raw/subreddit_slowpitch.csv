It makes sense so you dont intentionally walk a power hitter and go for a double play but this team we were playing kept changing their lineup and the umpire didnt notice.Obviously we shouldve called it out but there were a few other weird rules that we discovered throughout the game.I looked on our leagues website and the page with the rules is blank which is not helpful at all.,slowpitch,cil3iax,1,t5_2st4o

1726886,0,t3_2e7lhk,The main factor that comes in to play with those batting cage balls is the density and weight. Typically they are a rubber foam material that has variances in weight from the factory. Additional weight causes more stress on the barrel of your bat much like you wouldnt want to hit golf balls a baseball or a weighted practice ball.More commonly than that though is that those balls tend to be pretty porous and can soak up water fairly easily. Now if youre using batting cages that are indoors and temperature controlled you probably dont have any issue beyond the balls possibly being heavy from the factory but since they are so soft as it is they wont do a single thing to break in your bat anyhow.,slowpitch,cjwu7ce,2,t5_2st4o

3678960,0,t3_32g53x,Running drills only works if people come out. Your first step is getting people to buy into coming out to play which is really tough. Especially in beer leagues. Sometimes the best thing you can do is just focus on the players who actually care as much as you do. BP for a little bit then switch to fielding practice for a little bit. You guys will pretty quickly build up more skill and more camaraderie and others will follow suit if they want to stay in the loop. And really as others have said it really helps to bring a case of beer to practice. Thatll get people to come out and you can take it to the next step from there. But above all you have to get that team buyin which happens a little bit at a time. My team still only gets a consistent six or so guys but we started with just two. The others will buy in as long as they see that itll be a good time. Conversely you may be just playing with guys who dont give a shit and just like the socialization aspect. In which case it sounds like theres a disconnect between what you want and the type of league you play in. And the solution for that is to find a new league. ,slowpitch,cqbmjad,2,t5_2st4o

4102973,0,t1_crnyiks,gt sometimes it is just adjusting to the pitcher. I always try to take a pitch or two my first at bat just to see the ball. Thats something big that I didnt touch on right there. I try not to lock in to a specific position in the box because every pitcher is different. Low arc landing right behind the plate? I need to move up. High arc back of the zone? Move back. Good call on watching a few for sure.,slowpitch,crnyps9,2,t5_2st4o
4294186,0,t3_3a63vi,When youre on deck take a minute and visualize your at bat. Visualize the exact pitch you want to swing at and visualize yourself hitting that pitch. This little mental exercise is quite effective.Now when you go up to bat only swing if you see that exact pitch you visualized. Unless you have  strikes on you you dont need to swing the bat unless it is your pitch. Youll get better results swinging at the pitch YOU want to hit not the one the pitcher wants you to hit.

7804050,0,t3_4lidno,Its definitely a good starting point. A couple quick things I noticed.  You have alot of pre swing movement from your hands to your hips you rock back and forth a bit. If you eliminate those you swing gets to a point that you are starting your swing from the same position every time. That is the building blocks of a repeatable swing.  You have a good load in your swing but your step out of that seems to be inconsistent. When you go to plant your lead foot you transition to more of a upright position and all that power you are generating from your big leg kick is lost because you cannot transfer your power very efficiently.  In conjunction with the last point when you go to plant your front foot your back foot rolls up onto the toe much like a golf swing. Baseball and softball swings are a bit different. Pretend that there is a bug under the ball of your back foot and when you rotate your back foot you are squashing the bug. So when everything works together you have a strong front leg kick you explode your hips through the ball you back leg with naturally turn counter clockwise since your a righty on the balls of your foot. You knee should bend a little bit. It helps you transfer power from your legs all the way through your arms which is how it should be. I was trying to find an example from one of my BP Session videos but noticed that I am guilty of it too. I am currently picking my back leg up all the way instead of pushing off of it. That is probably why I have lost some power recently. ,slowpitch,d3t8ix1,1,t5_2st4o
