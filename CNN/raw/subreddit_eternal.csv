11189710,0,t3_5zqneh,I like this change. Im also pretty fine with no change but it does seem more fair with a nerf. Fwiw you get more life in Eternal and the unit stats are slightly buffed compared to Magic.,eternal,df0c9jw,2,t5_2r5b2
11531837,0,t3_64lhcm,You didnt exactly answer any of the questions people have been asking.Primarily why make a duplicate sub completely out of the blue? If there is another reason other than you wanting to mod? Which is fine and allowed and all but kinda backwards when it comes to community building.Its a fan sub... But so is the other one. Its not run by DWD but what it is is well established and with a mod team as opposed to you know a single guy doing whatever.Id get it if this sub had a theme or any kind of a twist to it  la summonerschool overwatchuniversity etc but as things stand its just a competing sub splitting the subscribers and confusing new players who may stumble on this one first without knowing of better.From a quick glance I saw several new players posting all excited about the game and then getting a single reply if that due to this subs size. Whereas praise threads have frontpaged on the other sub a bunch of times. There have also already been people surprised at the fact that there was a larger sub at all.P.S. Censorship is simply not a good move period. Posts and comments containing a link to the other sub seem to magically vanish from this one.,eternal,dg34weh,25,t5_2r5b2
