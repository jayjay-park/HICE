291794,0,t1_cfaznop,Thats simply because the fast hit goes through first. A Phalanx only has more range with his fast hits than some other characters but its also a stab so itd make Foils a lot more powerful. Though that means that as a Ryoku or Pure you can avoid it and punish the Phalanx quickly and powerfuly. ,bladesymphony,cfb0c37,1,t5_2sovp

966001,0,t3_25667a,You can view a detailed report of each duel on their website.  But I feel ya people havent settled into their correct divisions yet so maybe give it a week.,bladesymphony,che3dme,1,t5_2sovp
973742,0,t1_chev7qi,Ryokus forward airs are pretty bad. Some people use them in very specific situations but most people just use side airs. Remember to aim at your opponent swords and swipes are no good if they miss.As for the jian as a weapon it has great airs but thats not what makes it good. Its a combo weapon. Every time your hit connects with an opponent the delay at the end of the swing between attacks is dropped by .. This is significant and makes some combos possible that were otherwise unimaginable. If you dont combo the Jian has the lowest damage out of any weapon. So its also a decently complex weapon because of that required a good understanding of all your characters combos or the ones you use for your playstyle.Also the intercept is pretty easy. Just time it to hit their attack. Once you learn the moves of the characters youll land it no problem. Its stupidly powerful.,bladesymphony,chez2dl,1,t5_2sovp
984958,0,t1_chg120a,Yeah its probably that you were very low steel and then got boosted back up.,bladesymphony,chg8x30,2,t5_2sovp
999336,0,t1_chh7znp,Its not in the technical sense but if you compare DS fighting mechanics to other popular RPGs coughelder scrollscough the mechanics are far more complex and varied.,bladesymphony,chhvroa,1,t5_2sovp
1005761,0,t3_25m091,Live by example. And then crush the trolls with your superior skill.Trolls have fun in ways completely different from the rest of us. I read about bowing in the community guide I think and I loved the fact such a thing exists. All we can do is stick to the ritual and show new players to Blade Symphony what the game is all about by sticking to being honorable and deadly duelists.,bladesymphony,chim2lx,1,t5_2sovp
1019439,0,t3_25m091,As long as you dont make a big deal about bowing I couldnt give a crap what people do in between fights. ,bladesymphony,chk615x,1,t5_2sovp

1064927,0,t1_chpbx4a,I doubt it it was just on sale last week. The ping will just be dependent on the quality and location if the server and your own Internet. Smite is pretty popular with a couple million users and still averages  higher than blade symphony for whatever reason. Its currentlyUSD. Im online right now in Texas US and I get a  ping to South East Asia and Australia.  Russia is also . ping to Germany...from the center of the US. Surely you cant have the same ping as me?,bladesymphony,chpc4ud,1,t5_2sovp

2340612,0,t3_2lvj40,A while ago I used all three stances and landed multiple Jian intercepts the biggest counter to spammers and still was flamed by a Diamond for spamming. This was in Duel so at least the spectators had my back and he sulked off to another arena.More recently Ive also seen a couple of people cant quite remember the rank but I think it was Diamond again flaming a heavyonly stance Phoenix when he beat them which is hilarious seeing as soloheavy Phoenix is easy to defeat. The point is that this is still a competitivefighting game so people get salty. Dont be intimidated whether its an Oak or a Diamond whos crying. That said Masters tend to be on the whole fairly cool guys.,bladesymphony,cm10ggi,2,t5_2sovp
