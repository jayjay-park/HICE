On the movement there will be a serial number that you can look up in the waltham database that uQuartzSplinter linked. If youre lucky there may be some other bits of info on the back like  jewels or something like that. Its been a while since I collected pocket watches but If I had to guess thats a size  watch maybe  jewels unlikely to be any fancier than that. Still pop open the back and let us know what you find!

I would say get it cleaned and use it they are a uniquely elegant form of timekeeping. ,pocketwatch,df2fu5g,2,t5_2ti8w
