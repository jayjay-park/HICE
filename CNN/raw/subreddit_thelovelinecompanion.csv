1559889,0,t1_cjbsc88,yeahmostly what dusty said. too lazy to put the thought in coming up with a thoughtful reply of my own except to say if anyone shouldve known the fray they were entering into it was Leif.  he shouldve put on the nut cup and handled his business like the king of TLC.  ,thelovelinecompanion,cjbszzm,1,t5_322fn

1651724,0,t1_cjmwuyl,So you are definitely amazing.. Where in Idaho is the job? Northern Idaho is so pretty but holy cow so cold. I guess Michigan is like that youre probably one of those people that can get cold and not completely freak out. Im not.. Im building scaffolds to something better I just dont know when the building will be done. Youre my hero.. In your situation which is hopelessly complicated the best you can do is pick a direction and steer the ship in the direction you while allowing yourself the permission to make course corrections as you learn more about what you need. I am so in love with this that Im tempted to hire you as my life coach. Totally going to do it. I mean steer the ship not hire you as my life coach.. Dont focus on the deadline since this particular moment is a year or two in a  year working life The only reason Im concerned about deadlines is because once the kids are in elementary school theres huge pressure from my husband and his family to put them into the Catholic school system which makes me want to pukerun away. So I kind of want to blow this joint before I even have to deal with that which would be  because my son will be in kindergarten next year and hes in a Montessori school so I want him to finish the threeyear rotation with the class hes in now then go to first grade  hopefully in a Montessori but at least not some crazy parochial school. And I dont mean to say thats the only reason I want to move. I dont love it here  its growing too fast and were surrounded by suburbs instead of in the country like we were five years ago I love my home state and miss it all the time and so on. So I suppose my deadline could be next winter instead of this year but Im so impatient. Plus Id want enough time to look for jobsconvince him to comeget my ducks in a row for him not to come..  Study for the out of state bar Im definitely going to do it. Its just a matter of timing. This winter would definitely be harder to find the time to study but like I said Im impatient so. I could take it next summer when the pass rates are higher even though I know thats just some weird statistics its still kind of a psychout but its so hard to find time in the summer with the work I have to do at home and on the property every day. Also Id love to just start studying now and take a more relaxed approach but the study courses you basically have to buy are condensed into the two months before the exam. I get it I guess but it doesnt make it easy for someone whos not a single justgraduatedunemployed candidate.. Practice a little law Im definitely going to do that starting this fall. My husbands firm hes an attorney too has offered to throw me some easy research and memo and briefwriting stuff so at least Ill stay in the game a little bit. . Being in the company of yoga people would probably feel better than the company of attorneys. Almost always. Except the touchyfeely yogis that want to get up in your space.. If youre planning on keeping the husband make a family trip out of the exam No idea whether I am or not. I think a lot depends on how this whole thing goes which is a strange thing to base it on but not really I guess. ,thelovelinecompanion,cjnd3ca,1,t5_322fn
