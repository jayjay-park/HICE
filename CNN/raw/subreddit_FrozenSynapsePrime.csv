1712662,0,t3_2e13rc,Information from that article and the comments The game is in the final stages of testing... The story in the campaign has the depth and size of a novel. In each mission youre briefed and debriefed. In a nutshell you take on the role of Tactics a tactical analyst to Petrovs Shard. Petrovs Shard is a small urban resistance group or sort of like a faction. Prime is a team based game and that team constantly changes. As the campaign progresses and the story unfolds you meet more and more characters that also help explain the story. The fastest if your not going for trophies and rank is about  hours. If your going for gold and want say not lose anyone on your team or a hostage or complete a mission in a lesser number of turns its easily  hours plus. There will be future blog posts in regard to the combat system and online modes.,FrozenSynapsePrime,cjv1kih,2,t5_3340v
