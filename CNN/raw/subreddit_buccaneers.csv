17480,0,t1_cefy2w7,gtTedford seems to favor bigger more physical backs. Martin doesnt fit that mold.The only one of that mold that Tedford had at Cal was Marshawn Lynch though you could argue that the Broncos CJ Anderson also fit.  All of the others Joe Igber JJ Arrington Justin Forsett Jahvid Best Shane Vereen Isi Sofele werent all that big or relied on top speed or shiftiness.gtAlso Tedfords past suggests he likes the featured back approach so the  back approach may not be a reality. While he generally had a feature back the backup got a LOT of snaps during games and that helped groom them.  Marshawn played a lot behind JJ Forsett behind Marshawn Vereen behind Best etc.  In addition his final years for better or worse he pretty much had a platoon between Sofele more of a scatback at  and CJ the lb bowling ball.Other than that I think youre pretty spot on.  If Tedford can dial back some of the complications and unnecessary nuances IMO Cal needless incorporated elements of the Wildbear and the spread later on during Tedfords tenure and stays true to a specific offensive identity things may turn out well.,buccaneers,cegf99s,2,t5_2rd5c

312729,0,t3_1xoi06,You may remember me from early January when I made a bunch of MUW clouds for NFL teams for the  calendar year. After feedback in my topic on rnfl I decided to recollect the data at the end of the season with a special modified dictionary enabled to eliminate even more common words. This new data was pulled immediately following the Super Bowl so as to encompass the entire season. After much internal deliberation I decided to leave team names on because there was just something wrong with seeing the name of a teams  rival without seeing that teams own name for a reference point. Cursing was also left on because I fucking wanted to leave that shit on fuck.I gathered this data for this using a script made by the folks over at rMUWs. The actual word maps were made through Wordle As the rMUWs bot only does this in monthly increments a little manipulation was required on my end to get the yearly breakdown. As I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness I used the HTML codes from this site for the colors. My apologies if these are difficult to see. Whats hardeasy for me to see has been easyhard for others to see before so I trusted in the site. Instead of posting the numbered top  words in this thread I have instead put them at the bottom of the imgur album.The rest of the NFC South Saints Panthers Falcons,buccaneers,cfd6lvy,2,t5_2rd5c

Im not a big fan of this business where rookies have to start because they were drafted in the first round and no one in the league has any patience anymore.  Take a guy like Bridgwater Bortles Manziel or trade down a few spots if you can and grab Carr then actually give him some time to learn whats going on before throwing him to the wolves.

997858,0,t3_25h1k8,Verner looks like the kind of guy who can make a Cover Two scheme work.He has good field vision in that he can read a quarterback from almost anywhere on the field.  This combined with solid agility enables Verner to read and jump a passing route.  Jumping passing routes is one of the secret weapons of the Tampa Two.Think of the two most successful iterations of that defensive set.  The Buccaneers had Ronde Barber whose field vision was pretty much unprecedented in the NFL and who retired with an eyepopping fourteen pick sixes.  Charles Tillman of the Bears has eight.  The pick six can be one of this defenses greatest weapons and Verner has a similar skill set to Barber and Tillman.  Of course even defensive touchdowns by design dont happen every week.  Verner has proven to be a solid tackler another requirement of a Tampa Two CB theres a lot of open field tackling and versatile enough that he wont stay in one place all game hiding the CB is another staple of this defense when its working properly.  Hes also not a trashtalker or a loudmouth something that fits in with the organization of Ronde Barber John Lynch Derrick Brooks and others.  Overall Verner was an excellent pickup at a virtual bargain price.  Hes one of many reasons I cant wait to see the Buccaneers on defense this year. ,buccaneers,chhppi4,2,t5_2rd5c

If the team rolls with Mett and he fails like you said you guys are screwed for a couple of years. And anyways statistically speaking the odds of a th round QB actually panning out are about as good as the odds of you getting a bullseye after I put a blindfold on you spin you  times then give you the dart not facing the target.But if Mett turns out to be a hit after you draft Winston or Mariota you could turn the th round pick you took him with into at least a couple nd rounders.,buccaneers,cnev4wg,3,t5_2rd5c
2741085,0,t3_2rd3l9,I think both are solid QBs and both can have bright futures. Both have their strengths and weaknesses.That being said Im leaning toward Mariota simply because he brings dynamic athleticism a humble demeanor and seems like an overall great guy . He is NOT a run first QB he knows when to use his legs to extend plays and find the open guy he knows when to slide and not take unnecessary hits and he brings speed to a position that is extremely rare. To me that brings excitement and a sense of hope that I havent felt since Ive been a Bucs fan.Im not going to get into Winstons past but to be completely honest Id rather not deal with media circus and ESPN circlejerk that follows Winstons every step. Every minuscule mistake will be microscoped and would get so old. I dont want the Manziel treatment coming to Tampa.I wouldnt be mad if we did decide Winston as I would rather us take  of the  QBs and not trade down.

2790220,0,t1_cnl7s1n,Well what are you saying then? You say dont take Mariota or Winston so youre saying the QB for the Bucs is either on the roster or they will get him elsewhere.  I can assure you Mike Andy Daltonlite Glennon is not the future and obviously  year McCown isnt. So are you saying get the QB after the st round or are you saying wait for another draft?It definitely has a lot to do with Luck and the fact that the  draft was so bad back to back. The Vikings and Jaguars specifically reached hilariously on QBs in the st in  that predictably ended up being awfulI love and follow the draft closely as well as college football and I barely knew who Gabbert was. Then in  Luck comes around and plays great right away setting the bar for future QB picks higher than most can possibly reach. Obviously with hindsight Geno shouldnt have been a st round pick but there were a lot of people that loved him as a prospect and thought he should have at least snuck into the tail end of the st round.It is about them not being Luck though. QB prospects having question marks is the norm. No prospect in any draft at any position doesnt have at least a couple question marks. That was accepted preLuck. Its like now if youre a QB prospect you need to be perfect otherwise you arent worth being the top pick which is silly. Both Mariota and Winston have the potential to be great franchise QBs. But theyll need some time to developand the obvious Winston charactermaturity issues so that means theyre marginal I guess.To go back to my first paragraph if youre suggesting that the Bucs wait til next year to draft a QB I hope you realize those QBs will marginal prospects as well in your eyes. Because they will have question marks just as these QBs do. If youre waiting for the Bucs to take a QB until theres one with no or very few question marks you will be waiting for a very long time.,buccaneers,cnl8kvt,6,t5_2rd5c

3005750,0,t1_co97uot,Mankins is a tough SOB. When he came here the first few games he was clocking any defender that was even near him. It was truly a joy to watch. As the year progressed I watched him stop caring. The Buccaneers are soft. I think playing for us has hurt him because he has had to soften his attitude and the other players not just the ones around him do not care to win or have any pride.As an example in week  against the Bengals with  left in the rd quarter  Thompson jumped offsides unabated to the quarterback and violently pushed McCown to the ground. It was flagged  yards for unnecessary roughness but it showed a lot about our team and Mankins. The play was a blatant disrespect for our players. Thompson could have very easily avoided McCown but he went way out of his way to shove him violently to the ground. It could have been call for being removed from the game. Mankins was the only offensive lineman to attack Thompson for what he did. Mankins turned around and shoved Thompson and was looking like he was going to beat his ass as he should have. But the rest of our lineman got in the way and kind of milled about. None of them went after Thompson who just turned his back and walked away like he did not have a care in the world. You could see the shoulders of Mankins just slump in disappointment and disapproval. Not one single offensive player either helped McCown up or came to his defense except Mankins. It was disgusting.There were many examples of things like that during the season. Our team is soft and seems more worried about being nice than actually being tough football players who are dedicated and loyal to each other. I think this has worn Mankins down. If a defensive player had done to Brady what Thompson did to McCown there would have been a riot on the field. Instead our players just milled about looking like they could not wait to go home and play xbox.Our team is more worried about eating ice cream at training camp than protecting our quarterback from getting bitch smacked on national television. We are soft from the top to the bottom. Mankins is probably going to collect his paycheck and get the fuck out of Tampa as soon as he can. And I do not blame him.,buccaneers,co9jl90,2,t5_2rd5c

3788188,0,t1_cqnw5j6,Sure. Rainey finished the season with Tampa under an expiring contract and has accrued a total of  years in the NFL years defined as being on a  man roster during  or more regular season games which qualifies him as a Restricted Free Agent  years or less  Exclusive Rights Free Agent and  years or more  Unrestricted Free Agent. Restricted Free Agents RFAs are restricted in the sense that their current team has first right to refusal allowing them the option to match any offer sheet coming from another team if they have made a qualifying offer or tender. There are  different levels of tenders a team can offer RFAs that determine both the level of compensation for the player and the compensation for the team should they choose not to match another teams offer sheet. First is the lowest tier a deal in the amount of .M plus a draft pick from the signing team equal to the players original draft round in return if the current team opts not to match the signing teams offer in the case of undrafted players like Rainey the team would not receive a draft pick since the player was not drafted. Then comes the middle tier a deal in the amount of .M plus a nd round draft pick from the signing team in return if the current team opts not to match the signing teams offer. Then the highest tier a deal in the amount of .M plus a st round draft pick from the signing team in return if the current team opts not to match the signing teams offer.Rainey was tendered a deal at the lowest tier so up until he signed it yesterday any team could have signed him to an offer sheet and forced the font office to choose to match the offer or let him go. It would have been the same scenario Tampa attempted with George Johnson. ,buccaneers,cqo30px,2,t5_2rd5c

I dont know if the Bucs see him as a better fit at LT than D. Smith.

5172857,0,t1_cv959uk,gt...fuck him and truebuccaneersfanhaha. I really wish the mods would do their job and ban you.You are the exact reason why our fan base is considered so ignorant. Let me explain something so that even you can understand it We beat a shitty team. Barely. That NO team is a shadow of itself. Besides the fact that they had to get rid of all their best players this year Drew Brees got hurt and threw about  ducks out there. We should have had at least  more interceptions than we did. They practically gift wrapped us that game. Brees threw some balls out there that my  year old niece would be ashamed of throwing. Not to take away our win because a win is a win but to be celebrating like we just cured cancer is kind of silly. But hey when you are one of the worst teams in the league anything is worth celebrating right? Not going out there and shitting our pants is worth throwing a block party at this point.Remember last week when everyone was all hey it is only one game? Yeah keep that in mind when you are circle jerking. We only looked halfway decent because NO looked retarded.So you can say fuck me all day long but what you are doing is ignoring reality and thinking that we are a good team because we beat up retards. Maybe if we are lucky we can win a couple more games this year against bad teams. That is Lovies MO anyhow. He wins when teams play bad and gets crushed by good teams. We have a schedule filled with bad teams this year. But I for one would rather be a good team that can beat the best teams in the league. I am not satisfied with getting wins against the bottom feeders and jostling to see who can be the top of the bottom. You have to beat the best to be the best. I want us to be the best.Now that you have set the precedent of calling me out when we win I am going to do the same when we lose. I am pretty sure I will do the vast majority of call outs.

5412217,0,t1_cw3g33h,My only argument for that is that great players rarely need or receive that discipline. I know that Gerald McCoy ronde barber Donald penn and davin Joseph our veteran leaders when Schiano got there were not against holding the rest of the team to such a high standard. In fact they all publicly endorsed Schiano even in his last season thats why I never turned on him. But since the majority of a team is not made of superstar leaders he was abrasive to most of the team. I assume you were also referring to talib as superstar talent that he let walk but talib is a legitimate scumbag and I had no problem with that. Id rather watch us lose than root for a menace to society however Bennett and Blount were not bad people they are just the type of players that ALL coaches dislike borderline uncoachable. Look at the coaches that were able to make the most of them they both won a  Super Bowl with them on the roster. Not because those players were there but because those coaches are great and like you said able to mold themselves to make the situation work.

That season was exceptional by even a great QBs standards.The thing I dispute most about people evaluating quarterbacks is that I think the current bar for what most people think is acceptable is so high that only Hall of Famers will ever be considered good enough.And there just arent that many of those.  People dont realize its not like a team can just wish really hard and land a franchise quarterback whos elite and other moronic buzzwords people love to throw out.Yes.  Teams that have those guys have an advantage.  But since there arent  quarterbacks that good in fact there are never more than like  teams have to make due.And you could do a lot worse than Alex Smith or Nick Foles but you cant bring either of those guys up these days without some smarmy quarterback worshipper suggesting that their teams both should and can easily upgrade.,buccaneers,cwvjaie,1,t5_2rd5c

I thought he was a superstar shut down corner? Meanwhile there are other top tier CBs like Mackensie that could very easily end up being a better pro. My other reasoning is that I feel we have a much larger need at DE than at CB. I want Shaq!Im also curious to see what we can still get from Verner and Banks. Theres certainly a chance one or both of them could bounce back in a new system and play significantly better. There is no such hope with our DE situation.

Denver has been our biggest trade partner according to rumors.

7427928,0,t1_d2mhai2,The UF defense did give up those stat lines to Cooper and Benjamin so on paper it looks bad but my point was Hargreaves who was not matched up against Cooper each play Bama moved him around alot specifically to avoid Hargreaves and exploit the others held his own and played well. As I said I couldnt find the stats for the  Kelvin matchup but seeing as how he was a true freshman its hard to imagine the Gators putting him on a guy like Benjamin each play so it was probably a similar type of situation in that game too. That all being said were cherry picking two games here against two guys who were on the brink of being NFL superstars while Hargreaves was a true freshman in one and at the beginning of his true sophomore campaign in the other. Seems a tad unfair especially considering how elite his play has been for the the last three seasons. That being said youre right that NFL  wrs are usually top tier like the list you mentioned for next season so Ill concede that we do face them more often than I first said. But lucky for us maybe Grimes will be covering those guys not VHGIII. But I have full faith that Hargreaves could hold his own right now at least against them.

8700057,0,t3_4z67wh,gt Sure a guy who had . sacks last season in New York and signed a lucrative contract this offseason should be a star but Tampa Bays recent track record with highpriced free agents including one at his very position hasnt been good. The Bucs signed Michael Johnson to a fiveyear deal worth  million and they cut him after just one season. In the case of Ayers his impact was felt the very first snap of training camp and it has made the whole defensive line better. Defensive tackle Gerald McCoy might not see as many double teams which frees both of them up. Ayers too is really helping along rookie Noah Spence who could have a breakout season as well. I respectfully disagree with Laines pick here. If I were to guess who is going to break out I would probably put my cards on Ali Marpet. When healthy last season he looked like he had AllPro upside. In my preseason prediction post for rNFL I predicted he would get second team AllPro this year. With Mankins retirement I think he becomes the single most important piece on our offensive line next year and gets to the next level. As Laine correctly pointed out we dont have a good track record with our FA signings. Thats not to say that Ayers wont pan out I loved the signing in fact. I just would associate breakout with a younger star than a guy whos in his thirties. ,buccaneers,d6t50nl,4,t5_2rd5c

10714876,0,t3_5t8asx,In my opinion well more than likely be looking at a running back committee next year with a combination of Quizz Sims and a RB that well draft between the nd and th this season. I think Dougs played his last days in a Bucs jersey. Hes had  allpro years and  years where he averaged just over ypc in between injuries.Hes in rehab and we owe him nothing and that doesnt spell great thing for his future but hopefully he does well in rehab because a team will definitely latch on to him if he can prove hes worth it this offseason.I think we should look to expecy Quizz as a lead back Sims as our passing down back and both will be spelled by a draft pick. We wont get Cook or Fournette but theres still some really good talent at HB throughout the top half of the draft.Our O Line is too broken and were too close to competition for us to try and build it through the draft. Hawley can survive at center and Marpet will be great for years to come hopefully but we need to figure out what Sweezy and Smith are going to do on the left side.

I think the main difference is that Ross has lbs on Westbrook which is huge considering they are both pretty small. It gives the appearance Ross will be more durable even if that isnt actually the case. Im not really buying that just because of the type of players they are.

We have  of the same OL from team  of which are no longer rookies along with a better Center and roughly the same caliber LG. A great RB makes your OL look better. We didnt have any great RBs last year and thus no one views the rushblocking ability of our OL very highly. Personally I hope one of the passrushers falls to us like Barnett and we grab him.

11788267,0,t3_6873kn,Lost my team when the Rams left St. Louis tried to be a vikings fan then my hate for the Minnesota Wild tainted anything to do with Minnesota sports.Its my personal opinion that Godwin will be the best WR out of this draft so Im gonna be keeping my eye on the Bucs from here on out. Also the pirate ship is dope as hell,buccaneers,dgw8mro,59,t5_2rd5c
11788654,0,t3_682gig,Weve traded back up  I wonder if its for Davenport or King.,buccaneers,dgwa7oj,2,t5_2rd5c
11788726,1,t3_682gig,I liked the idea of trading up and going defense but LB? The one position unit we dont need,buccaneers,dgwai8t,-1,t5_2rd5c

11798110,0,t3_68c2s3,Sign him to a cheap deal and see if he can beat anyone out. If he still has anything left I could see a use for him even if its as a th wr or something. ,buccaneers,dgxcu1o,2,t5_2rd5c
11799260,0,t1_dgxh1ja,Im being sarcastic.  What you said about people brushing off racial issues as irrelevant complaints.  If we tell ourselves that those injustices dont exist or have nothing to do with race then we can all tell ourselves that we solved racism. And a lot of people want to believe that more than they want to address those problems.,buccaneers,dgxhj99,4,t5_2rd5c
