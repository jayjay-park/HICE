6536209,0,t3_44wvhx,That looks like a lot of fun! Bookmarked to try later. Quick question... I have a couple of shmup levels but they use the fireflower. Is this station just for clown car shmups? TIL a new word... Shmup. Shmup shmup shmup. It sounds like a small furry animal from Newfoundland,secretroomclub,czveaa0,4,t5_3cdps

One part is normal castle theme and one part underwater because turtles live both on land and in water The stage offers a variaty of challenges to procede jumping on a giant buzzy beetle on a track hopping over turtles from tower to tower some minor puzzeling swimming through an underwater fortress. Getting through giant koopa sprites both on land and in the water. It also offers some shortcuts and secret treasure room. The clear rate is about . at the moment.

6741238,0,t1_d0gl18n,Thanks uuberMario! my boyfriend Jason made it through guess how long it took him?  minutes. He kept dying at the part where the wiggler is between the piranha plants. He finally got the jump right and the rest was easy! He loves your levels and was ecstatic!,secretroomclub,d0globq,2,t5_3cdps
6758945,0,t3_456pql,I want to do something completely different then Ive ever done before. I have never done a SMW level. If I were to undertake this momentous task I would definitely need some advice. For one thing I dont understand the mechanics of this theme at all. NSMBU is my comfort zone and Id like to push myself past that to really challenge myself. Jason can help me a bit with this as he is really into retro but I need more help from makers like  uWebbieWife uShadowfox uTheBigLebootski uThatTomHall etc. If anyone wants to help me out with this theme Id greatly appreciate it! ,secretroomclub,d0ifjjr,3,t5_3cdps

6959714,0,t3_4aj7ht,I will have to revisit this soon. I am definitely impressed with what Ive seen so far. I didnt know what happened when you jumped into a clown car with those winged boo buddies around it lol! I am really disappointed in Nintendos pink coincheckpoint issue. I keep having to work around the check point so people dont lose their coin progress but Im also not clever enough to do something like this. ,secretroomclub,d157vl0,4,t5_3cdps

7150058,0,t3_4dhb5y,I have found them all.. I guess I have to grind using the tracker..  I just dont like the tracker submission thing at all because it feels like work to me.,secretroomclub,d1qw0od,2,t5_3cdps
7170379,0,t1_d1t3fga,Where did you get stuck with the autoscroll approximately?   Also this must be an autoscroll level because otherwise the player could just walk backwards to make the new enemies and items appear! how do you think I could improve the bowser section?   also is there any part on the main level you found too hard?  a few other things do you think its dumb that i even have pink coins?  they serve no purpose really.. also thoughts on how i give weird mushroom on the bowser section?  sorry i took so long to reply.  my internet was down.thanks a lot for the detailed review chicky! ,secretroomclub,d1t7dvz,2,t5_3cdps

7232295,0,t3_4dq9d3,I stumbled upon this room and I am not sure if this an invite only club or not but I had  quick question about what qualifies as a secret room. Does a reward room at the end count as a secret room if it means you have to collect  red coins hidden throughout the level?,secretroomclub,d209bxz,3,t5_3cdps
7242031,0,t1_d21cqyx,Thank you so much!  Happy to hear you enjoyed the level!  I am very happy you got to see the entire level.  Most players will not even see the level change upon multiple plays.  Im glad you got to see that.   When the next level is done I dont think i will include the dark farm as part of the coin rankings.  I am also thinking the next level will be spinies and drybones.  I was thinking of putting large spinies on ceilings and have them drop down to break blocks similar to this level but maybe not have a sub section that is played.  I really wanted to have a velocity spring sling shot in the sub level where the player jumps off a super fast spring to grab red coins but it got patched out during the last update.   ,secretroomclub,d21d75s,2,t5_3cdps
