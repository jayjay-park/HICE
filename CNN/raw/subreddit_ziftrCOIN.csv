4049112,0,t3_36w7bv,Hi nickiheskjaer the latest update should have fixed that issue are you sure you have the latest version from  Also what OS do you use?,ziftrCOIN,crhtw3e,1,t5_3397c
4246763,0,t3_39k8uq,Thanks for the feedback. Its always helpful to learn about the user experience and hear what they have to contribute to our apps.We agree that security is important. We havent yet added any sort of pin protection per se to enter the wallet itself as it seems to be a bit redundant because users can set a password required to send any coins in the app. Additionally we feel that most users would also lock their mobile device with a pin codepassword.The good news is the others are already on our road map. HD wallets and better backuprestore features are in progress and should be expected soon. We also have a handful of NFC features planned which includes possibly using it for FA.In the meantime you can backup your wallet now by selecting Export Wallet from the debug menu. If a password is set the backup will be encrypted with the password. Note that similarly to desktop QT wallets sending coins may cause coins to be lost from the backup.,ziftrCOIN,cs4blc1,2,t5_3397c

5956558,0,t1_cy0fipf,Looks to me that they have Ziftrcoin as a coupon entry. Price in the example is  per coin. That would be real nice!,ziftrCOIN,cy0fos1,2,t5_3397c
7097042,0,t1_d1ksj0x,Not bad. There are getting to be a lot of X coins. How bout ZGC?,ziftrCOIN,d1ktj22,2,t5_3397c
7510445,0,t1_d2vrpod,Definitely not now but you got to start somewhere right? The distribution curve isnt going to dump billions of coins into the market anytime soon. The way I see it going is this optimistically. Finish the platform which they are currently working on. Sign more companies to use the GoCoin payment method which is the next big step. . As more companies start using it it will gain traction. . Continue to expand with more retailers.. Soon enough slightly bigger players will join on and it could start a snowball effect. I might add that GoCoin has a lot of advantages with how they are structured at least in the eyes of retailers such as zero chargebacks.Something I like is I can already use the GoCoin payment method to pay for movie tickets. Thats not a small thing. They have Movietickets.com as a partner as well as a travel industry and some NSFW websites. My point is they wouldnt give a rats ass now but if this catches on with numerous smaller retailers I can see it gaining attention. Thats an if though not guaranteed. None of this is ever guaranteed but I can see it happening and Im hedging my bet that it will gain traction eventually. Probably wont be tomorrow but I can see it happening within a few years at the latest. ,ziftrCOIN,d2vwex7,1,t5_3397c
7832858,0,t3_4kxl6f,I just had a look at website and my old ziftr login works. That is a good sign for them doing the right thing by ziftrcoin ICO holders.,ziftrCOIN,d3whbk1,2,t5_3397c
7845601,0,t1_d3v1tsv,Escrow through a reputed rd party and not using Paypal. The escrow takes the ziftr or the other crypto asseses he has the volume the buyer sends funds to the seller  he confirms recieving them and the escrow releases funds.Of course the process is auditable by any of the  members because the adresses are publicly visible.I am willing to provide this security if you trust me to do so.,ziftrCOIN,d3xwxk3,1,t5_3397c
8045131,0,t3_4pbt67,A few questionsconcerns.  Since this will now be used as a coupon controlled by merchants does this mean that we will not be able to buy a product FULLY with GoPoints unless the merchant chooses to even if the exchange value surpasses the ?  With these GoPoints coming in from the network after the closed loop it seems if used merchants will end up with even more GoPoints. What is their incentive to use these points? Will they be able to exchange them for fiat easily and if so will it be exchanged at a controlled rate I dont think it would be tempting for them to do so at very low prices which if they dont find them valuable why use GoPoints instead of any other free point system ?Im just concerned about what will drive the value of the pointscoins as at low  discounts I dont think people will care to mine or buy GoPoints. If stores get to higher percentages like    redemption for competitive products then were talking but I dont see the incentive for them to do that.Im hoping for the best and maybe some answers will stomp my concerns. Thanks  ,ziftrCOIN,d4kckol,1,t5_3397c
