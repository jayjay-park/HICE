5722113,0,t1_cx6cc4i,Fahrenheit was not more arbitrary than Centigrade.  It was chosen so that human body temperature was at the mid range of the scale.  There is some debate about what the lower point of the scale was originally based on but it is generally considered to be based on a freezing point of a  mixture of salt and water.Both scales are utterly arbitrary  the assignment of a random scale to phase changes of arbitrarily chosen materials.  There is nothing universally fundamental about the freezing point of water versus a saltwater mixture.  Both would give you relatively invariant temperature points for the accuracy of the time.  Both scales have the same upper point which is even more variant with pressure.  Even the Centigrade scale is arbitrary.  What is fundamental about ?  The fact that we have  fingers?  It is simply a matter of convenience to make our base  math a little less messy and is in no way less arbitrary that  which was chosen to have most of the everyday temperatures we experience cover a wide range with human body temp being at the rough midpoint.Even Kelvin is arbitrary to an extent  it uses shifted degrees Centigrade as the units.  Only the zero point has any basis as a true nonarbitrary basis for measurement.  The triple point of water would be another acceptable point of reference.  Beyond that everything you tout as being a system of reason is simply another arbitrary human convention that has jack all to do with physics.  ,dataisugly,cx6dv2h,3,t5_2vmg2

Following the bible for example makes you Christian which is a valid holy monolithic religion in the eues of islam but that doesnt make the bible a muslim holy book it makes it a holy book in Islam.

Whether its Fox Newsrdataisuglycommentsujuthisiswhybarchartsshouldalwaysstartatzero or the Economist theyre both wrong. It doesnt matter if they did it on purpose.

This is a cynical political attempt to make the increase in staffing levels appear greater than it is.I counted four ways in which the chart misleads.First having a yaxis that doesnt start at zero is only helpful under certain circumstances and those circumstances do not apply here.Second when the yaxis doesnt start at zero it should be labelled clearly.Third when the yaxis doesnt start at zero there should usually be a clear discontinuity on the yaxis just before it meets the xaxis.Fourth when you use lots of drawings of objects to represent a quantity of those objects the number of drawings should be proportional to the quantity they represent.

This matters because it helps us know whether we should focus more on absenteeism or more on something else that absenteeism indicates like poverty unstable or unhelpful home lives abuse hunger etc. etc.  Based on that research we dont know!  And if absenteeism is more of an indicator than a cause of low grades then spending money and time to create interventions and slick posters is foing to be a total waste and will do little to improve those kids grades and test outcomes.,dataisugly,d41wm9v,4,t5_2vmg2
