Even in sleep he was troubled with a line of concern on his forehead and the corners of his mouth slightly downturned. Perhaps he ruled the realm in his dreams as he would someday when he succeeded his father. A tear came to her eye at that thought. She did not wish the kingdoms burdens on him. But she had no power over the laws of gods and men only over herself. And she would not place another burden on him when his back was almost breaking with the weight of what he carried. She went to her horse and quietly prepared her for the ride to come. It would be a long way but she would manage. At the last moment before she would leave she turned back to Rhaegars steed and carefully sorted through the saddlebags. When she found what she wanted she sat down to write then trudged slowly back up the hill to place the scrap of parchment on his chest.

The accused would be condemned only if her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot. It is known as the Sotah One writer has recently argued that the procedure has a rational basis envisioning punishment only upon clear proof of pregnancy a swelling belly or venereal disease a rotting thigh. gtInteresting Sassywood | Bishaa | Bedouin systems of justice | Manorial court Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqkquf oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqkquf.

3788112,0,t1_cqo2faf,Did you get a message from mag? Basically we need to come up with roll values for detection making it up the wall horn blowing for reinforcements. Then it will be a basic skirmish once they are up. I am fine with the values we had before we should have just sent out numbers to the mods. I was thinking for the horn blowing we could roll a d. If the patrols spotted the climbers beforehand  means no horn was blown  means it was. If the climbers made it up undetected before attacking the opposite. So  is horn blown  is not. I feel the reasoning behind this is pretty clear if they see them climbing the wall unless they just straight up forget a horn is gonna get blown.If the horn blows  reinforcements arrive.

He stood up from the chair and reached into his cloak pulling out the necklace he had stored in the hidden pocket. Id say youd look more beautiful with this around your neck but Im afraid its impossible for you to be any more beautiful than you already are.

Quellon pulled out a letter from the bank of Tyrosh. This bank  shows I have enough gold  gold for which to pay for your services and if all goes well it would lead to further easier work. I propse that you and your crew join me in a raid on the Haunted forest wildling clans beyond the wall. Mayhaps supported by the Nightswatch. I figure that I will pay you enough  gold and that you may take your spoils in the form of the slaves. Yet if we collect none Ill pay you the other gold at Tyrosh IF no slaves are taken.

He looked up to maester Luwin and more specifically at the small link on his chain the one made of Valyrian Steel. What do you make of this?Maester Luwin scoffed. Those of us who study magic know the giants died out years ago but... If there were giants or more likely just a group of large wildlings if they were there then this Lord Commander intends to let them through the wall and I think we should stop them its what the wall was built for.Rickard sighed kneading at his temples. I dont exactly have a lot of time right nowWhy not send Brandon?Hes also got things to do and probably believes in this less than I.Benjen?Benjen is only a child he cant go north of the wallBenjen is seven and ten my lord even when interrupting the maester was ever polite.

What risk is there?Does he?Does he what?Yearn for adventure Gods damn it you know more of my children than I do. I barely even see Benjen these days. Ill talk to him but Im not pushing him into it.A real adventure? Giants north of the wall? A chance to prove himself to everyone to Ysilla to Brandon...Yes. Yes Ill go.Alright youll have  of our best men including Jory and Maester Luwin has asked for you to accompany Sam his assistant.

His raged had somewhat decreased though not nearly enough. I do suppose you have warranted they may be I still have not been given the original reason for these ships. They were in those waters long before these cunts attacked your men. I think you and I both know Lord Tywin that there is another reason as to why they are there. Aside from the obvious running patrols.Victarion crossed his arms across his chest. The Ironborn have been crippled and we could not dare face your fleet. He tossed a hostile look to his brother.

Truly Lucerys there are few people in these Kingdoms whos advisement I would still trust but your loyalty to the future of these Kingdoms is unquestionableAll those Southron dealings were the machinations of old Rickard whos health seems to fade as the Winter grows closer. Tywin shook his head answering his guests question And you know as well as I do how the father and son often hold dissimilar ideals... Tywins memory flooded with the differences between Rhaegar and Aerys Balon and Quellon Robert and Steffon even his own father and himself... The list of fathers and their sons clashing over ideals was long and even longer in regions with differing religions than the Seven.I do not hear anything from the North besides the conflict between their own lords which is disconcerting. And with Winter fast approaching we know how much the North will suffer worse than us men pushed to their limits often make dangerous moves.

Placing a mere child on the throne only for more disputes about his legitimacy and sanity be brought upon us in the future?

Ive spent the last half a decade hiring mercenaries and pirates to help Tywin seize the throne by force should a fight come.

4045334,0,t3_36ups0,Aemon EstermontThe debate had once again been a heated and repetitive affair. Accusations and recriminations had flung backwards and forwards. However when names were being bandied rather than discussions of proposals it had been easier to keep track of which man had the most support... And it had seemed clear Lord Baldric was the most popular man. Aemon had gambled and as he had done yesterday and had once more called for a vote this time with more success. Lord Baldric had won though strangely it had been Lord Swann who had enjoyed greater support than Lord Trant. Odd that. Aemon thought back to the message he had received from Ser Addam Selmy a few days back about being offer a Wardenship in exchange for a vote for Lord Swann. He had declined the offer then perhaps a more interested party had been found. Aemon was snapped out of his reverie by an ever swelling chant of Baldric! Baldric! A broad smile spread across his face as he lustily joined in the chat. Later as the chants had died out he approached the Lord of Blackhaven.Aemon clasped hands with his new Lord Regent and offered him a few polite words of congratulation. Gesturing behind him towards the mighty castle towering over Shipbreaker Bay Aemon smiled as he surrendered My Lord Regent the castle is yours. I shall go ready my troops to march home on the morrow.As Aemon turned to leave he stopped himself and addressed the Regent once more. Oh my Lord I hate to bring this up now but it is a pressing matter. You must make a decision on the Prince Viserys.

He looked until he saw the beautiful girl with the voice of a goddess Youre the opening act so I need you to sing better than youve ever sung before! Also you all should be very happy to hear that Lord Eddard Stark will be joining us tonight and is very curious to see our production of Hamnet! Fortunately Hamnet will be the final performance so he should see many of you perform. Best of luck to all of you! Now lets do this thing! There was a brief and mocking cheer before everyone returned to their duties. Finally the guests started arriving and finding their seats and tables.

Valaena and Corlys were still too young to think of their father as anything but a distant hero a blur they could not remember. He had not bothered to change that notion. But Baelor had been old enough when Rhaegar died. Too young to understand but old enough to remember.Your father was a weak man he finally said. He was selfish and vain and arbitary. He accepted no help and no council and alienated all those who sought to guide him all those who could have taught him to be a better king. He took lovers frequently and beat your mother sent her away to Dragonstone in exile time and time again. When you came to Drifmark that last time before she... He paused finding his throat more dry than he couldve imagined. She intended to leave him then for she had discovered he had fathered a bastard that was then passed off as the trueborn heir of a powerful lord. She sought to protect you and to take you far away from his reach. But soon enough she was gone.All the while other lords were plotting against him. Tywin Lannister sought to murder your father and your brother and your sister and you and place his own son on the throne. And though I tried time and time again to warn your father of the danger he faced he would not listen. He turned everyone who might aid him against him and none supported him any longer. And the time came when I had to choose to fight against him myself or to see your family my family fall to the Lannisters.I deposed your father Baelor. I ended his reign. And as a result of that he took his own life in shame. He paused and solemnly looked his grandson in the eyes. I do not regret it for an instant.

No my mother never took me with her she replied a tone of bitterness finding its way into her words. Whilst my mother went to Essos I was held in Dragonstone as a ward. A hostage is more of an apt term. Marq and Allyria had blamed their mother but Kyra had always known it was Jonothors fault for being so reckless. Nobody controlled him. Not even as a child.Mother says the east is very beautiful but I think it might be bewildering Kyra admitted. As to what it looks like well she brought back a hoard of portraits and landscapes from her time there. I could show you she almost said before sobering.

Lady Allyrion was always a problematic choice but to dismiss her in such an obvious way was... unwise. Profoundly unwise.He thought about Drumm about the man whod dueled the bloody Mountain for his vengeance. He was not a man to poison his enemies any more than Stark was nor to dispose of them politically. The Ironborn regent did not like loose ends. That much Lucerys had gathered.Lady Serala is more likely to murder a Rosby than marry one he griped. But a thought had occurred to him quite a while ago one which now convinced him he ought to go himself regardless of what the spymaster cautioned. In any case I dislike such unrest so close to the capital. Both houses are integral parts of the Crownlands and should their feud continue however justified it puts the city and the king at risk.Lucerys tried to puzzle out the meaning of the mans last words was he asking for a bribe? Before he could respond however there was a knock at the door from a serving girl who he waved in vaguely annoyed. She kept her eyes downcast obviously illatease in front of Velaryon and set a plate of delicate pecan pastries and cranberry tarts down on his desk.

4662041,0,t1_cthxpei,Father once told us this story started Arlan a story about two crows.All the kids in the circle fell silent eager to hgt Once upon a time in the Dornish Marches there lived a young princess. She as fair as the sun her beauty unmatched in any maiden in the land and she had a kind heart and a gentle demeanor. Lots of people from all of Westeros came to court her but she refused them all as they were all too prideful vengeful or lustful for her liking. Until she met a man called the Kind Crow. The Kind Crow was not the prettiest knight nor he was the most skilled one but he was kind with everyone not only with her. Both of them fell in love and decided they would marry.gt However the Kind Crow had a brother. A very greedy brother who only thought about himself and treated other people badly in order to achieve what he wanted. Like the Kind Crow the Greedy Crow wanted the Princess for himself not because he loved her but because he wanted to have that beautiful woman for himself. So one day when the Princess was outside of the castle he kidnapped her and locked her into a tower while locking his brother on a cell far away from her.gt Enraged the princess family declared war to the Greedy Crow and sieged his castle. But they were unable to get inside. The Greedy Crow had threatened to kill the Princess saying that if he could not have her no one else would. All hope seemed lost but the Kind Crow had something the Greedy Crow did not have. Friends. And one of those friends was a brave hero who during the night managed to sneak inside the castle and take him out of his cell. Together the Kind Crow and his friend confronted the Greedy Crow and defeated him saving the Princess and stopping a war that would have killed hundreds of people.gt And thus the Kind Crow and the Princess married and lived happily ever after.After finishing the story Arlan looked around to see if his companions had liked his story. Beric gave him a faint smile as if he already knew the tale he had told and the little girls were staring at him eyes wide open as their hands were trying to cling into the nearest grownup they had found. ,IronThronePowers,cti7fpx,2,t5_361bq

He imagined the thick red nectar coursing down his gullet. The desert vampire took his cigarette into clawed fingers and rubbed it into the cutting board then flicked it away into a pot. He was starved but it would be rude not to enjoy the flavors of the cooking so Etan cut off a smaller piece a hand then raised it before him towards the cook. Alak DhaTar!

5214489,0,t3_3md2qu,meta I can give you a bit of background on the Rosbys in case you need it Lord William formerly Bill killed Jonothor Darklyn. For some reason he also disinherited his eldest son Ser Duncen in favour of his second born Ser Tommard. Ser Duncen became a hedge knight. He then came to Duskendale to try to plot with Serala Darklyn to allow her to get vengeance by allowing Darklyn forces into Rosby where they were to covertly kill William and Tommard handing the reigns back over to Duncen. Serala saw through the plan and had him arrested publicly along with his retainers for treason. So Ser Duncen is currently rotting in the Dun Fort dungeons. ,IronThronePowers,cvejf65,2,t5_361bq

It is a dim lit maze of a place with a hundred private alcoves and hidden nooks whose blackened beams and cracked ceilings echo in the din the sailors traders captains money changers shippers and slavers lying cursing and cheating each other in half a hundred different tongues. A lot of business is done in the common room. There is a central courtyard where a trellis of flowering vines throws intricate patterns across the flagstone floor and green and purple moss grows between the stones. The widow of the waterfront has a customary table in the common room in the corner by the courtyard where she is steeped in shadow so that she herself is nigh invisible.Characters to interact with InnkeeperBartender Baenowin MagretridTall lean older man with light violetblue eyes and a bald head Tavern WenchServing Girl ElyiseBright violet eyes with yellow hair a cheeky grin and an ample bosom Plotter VurnSmells of smoke with a large black cloak over his shoulders and pieces of armor on his person brown eyes tanned golden skin and brown hair Mysterious ?She has green eyes long blood red hair a heart shaped face and is filing her nails idly with a wine glass of red wine next to her going untouched,IronThronePowers,cvs0fyt,1,t5_361bq

Laid out before him was all the beauty of the Marches sprawled out beneath a glowing spring sun. The tents of the myriad nobles who had come for the celebration clustered together by their regions like a patchwork of cloistered villages. There he saw the Falcon of Arryn accompanied by a small cluster of Hunter banners. Further along he saw a large mass of Reachmen foxes and grapes and trees all swaying gently in the wind. His heart sank as he found the sun and spear of House Martell. Three years he muttered to himself.For a moment he felt the urge to walk down from Summerhall and join his countrymen in their camp. That urge lasted until he caught sight of the other banners in the camp. No where in sight were the golden and purple of his own House Dalt that he had expected but painfully present was the swooping black vulture of House Blackmont standing alongside the falling star of House Dayne. Andrey could feel his stomach tying itself tightly in a knot even worse than the initial anxiety he had felt over the tourney to come.

House Manderly provides the brunt if the support to the watch and expended the majority of the coin and manpower in the search for the Wildlings after their sacking of Eastwatch is it not telling that we refused to support this endeavour despite that?. Does the failure of the Watch not indicate that they are incapable of defending against a few paltry savages and ought to be replaced with some more modern sophisticated lines of defence?.

They took no hostages and sacked no keeps you may say that they killed Eddard for his resistance to the crowning yet there is no proof of that and I have resisted it too and they have done naught to me. If they had no honor they would have struck before sending the Declaration. They would have resisted me taking my rightful place as regent and they would have resisted me even attempting to make a peace that leaves the North inside the Seven Kingdoms. They may even have attacked White Harbour. Call them traitors as much as you will Lord Manderly. I will not contest that. But they have done very little to show dishonor.He looked at Baelish with an iron stare. You say these are the only terms. You must realize that there are only two scenarios which can result from this. Either I accept and the North devolves into a civil war and destroys itself for the Northern Lords will not go along with this. Or I deny and the rest of the realm descends on the North and destroys it from the outside. You must realize that this is a farce these terms are warbait. They are unjust and arbitrary. They are to be executed without trial for signing a piece of parchment? What of those who signed because they feared what their fellows might do if they did not? What of those who cheered for the crowning in this very hall but signed nothing? What of the people around the Realm who express opinions almost identical to the ones put on the Declaration? On my way from Kings Landing I met Ser Tristifer Whent. I had never seen him before yet he freely told me of how little he respected the Crown or the King. Shall you execute him? Shall you execute the Riverlords who committed much more violent treason against their lieges the Tullys? Of course you will not.He leaned forward. I do not want war but accepting your terms will bring it as surely as refusing it. His Grace said that there will be no negotiating yet I must try anyway. There are so many other options that would not result in civil war. I would return threefold all lost taxes and double taxes sent for the next five years. I could have Lyarra ward wherever you wish. I could have the ringleaders be tried for treason and myself as well if that is what it takes and I will ensure that this never happens again. I could restrict my vassals ability to raise troops. I could have wards taken no House aside from the Manderlys will be permitted warships and I will make it clear in no uncertain terms what will happen if they ever do something so foolish again. I could also accept a coregent of the Crowns choosing to help Lyarra rule as a Lady Paramount. Any of these terms are incredibly harsh to the North infinitely more so than what was presented to the Riverlords or even to the rebels in the Reach but I can accept several of them and they will ensure a lasting peace. The terms you proposed will bring nothing but years of war. You may crush this rebellion but another will rise and another and another after that no matter how much I may try to prevent them.He leaned back again. Regardless of what your answer is I know that it is time for you to leave Winterfell. You likely plan on returning via White Harbour though I ask that you do not. Even should you accept my new terms then other northern lords may want to take revenge on you. I recommend that you allow me to send decoys disguised as the members of your party with a Stark escort on the road to White Harbour while you and your escort take a different route either through the Neck and down to the Riverlands or to White Harbour by a roundabout fashion. You will have a thousand Stark horsemen led by my castellan to protect you as well as your own escort disguised as Stark knights.

By securing the lands boarding his own with the aid of his own vassal Lord Blunt he acted solely in defense of his smallfolk against those who had vowed to fight to the last man. You swore oaths to defend your vassals I do recall but no defense could have come from Winterfell to aid White Harbour had he not acted. If it is the seizure of Ironrath you take issue with a seizure in which the blood of no loyal northman was spilled then you berate the wrong target. That decision lies not with Lord Manderly but with the crown who saw it as vital to end this as quickly as possible regardless of whose banners stormed the keep. Your grief over your cousin in no way excuses your alienation of a man who is so loyal he refuses to even draw steel against you in defense of his own life for he would rather die than betray his oath to serve your family.She smiled softly hand on the hilt of her own shortsword.Fortunately I have sworn no such oaths.

It is no issue though the lordship was an offer of gratitude for your service to the Crown. I had hoped to find the best holdfast in my and the kings ability to offer. My own abilities may be limited but I will continue to look for a way to accommodate you for your work to unify the realm. Even should it be simply continuing a closer relationship with the Crown and all of your pursuits for the time being.In any light Clarice considered his comments more now. The management and investment into it were all fine reasons. Going to Casterly Rock she knew though lords wandered about all the time it seemed. Her own brother an example of that. Yet the topic of defenses was interesting. In all the realms in the last twenty years only the Crownlands had never had a single holdfast attacked. Clarice took well to his advice though its meaning to her had to be deciphered. She did not know of Wendwaters strength on its own yet the Royal Navy was known from the Wall to Dorne to defend the Blackwater Bay.Clarice repositioned herself on the plush seat then went on in her flat tone Your advice and acumen will always be valued Lord Petyr holding the envelop he had given her in her hands.

She would not bring up the list of accomplishments Lucerys had had over his lifetime to earn a child being named for him. Not after Corlys had dismissed the man but her second sons name would be Lucerys all the same. Corlys had given her options before and she had planned on honoring Baelor in some way. Not anymore though.Your word has and will matter to me Clarice stated a little too strongly. Her own frustration of how this had been handled another resignation with such poor handling. I am afraid I am not privy to his plans either. I believe he is attempting to play at politics and is failing? making more of a mess? making allies into potential enemies? doing a poor job of it. I can think of two possibilities though neither are due to any ire for you Lord Lucerys. He believes Victarian will decline the offer then can use the offer itself as proof to the Ironborn of attempted inclusion. Or...more likely he fears my presence in Court. Having a man who once fought against the Crown now apart of its Council would be a dramatic expression of offering second chances. Potentially how he believes he can sell his marriage to me to the greater realm.Clarice placed both hands flat on her dress now looking away from him after all that. She finally went on in her flat tone I do not agree with either notion Lord Lucerys. And I will speak with Corlys again on this. Perhaps I will be able to convince him.

He was careful to keep his voice low lest he attract unwanted attention to himself.

Tylaria held their youngest child and only boy together Eres in her lap and next to her sat their three little girls Penelope Bianca and Ellery.

He was going to speak out again questioning why he was being chosen now that Aerys was unfit why he required his Fathers assistance for however many years and not Aerys but glanced around the room at the others present. Now was not the time for those questions. They could speak of such later. Ah...questions yes. For now at least. Only a concern for one of your conditions. My Father is not likely to return to Kings Landing for a political appointment. When he left this city after your coronation officially resigning as Master of Laws he told me that was the last time hed...ah...well serve on the Small Council. His exact words were be a straw dummy with all the power of a housecat for the petty lords of the realm to beat on while watching criminals walk free. Jon thought to himself but knew better than to say. I can reach out to him and ask if his attitude on the matter has changed but...well youve met my Father Your Grace.

With any luck hed get his answers and foster a relationship with his lord that is amicable to both.At the mention of giving up his sword Ormund chewed on his lip for a moment before sighing and handing over his weapon. You may search to your hearts content he simply said. That was my only weapon. It was true that he had no need for more weapons than his own sword.

6375277,0,t1_cze8120,Corlys tore his eyes away from Yohns and wondered scratching his chin. What do I see in Jon? Why him over all the other choices? There had been many choices available many were qualified if not more than qualified. From Jon to Aerys Val to Joffrey Lannister. Each brought a unique perspective to the role and each couldve done extraordinarily well. So why Jon?He looked back at Yohn. In Jon I see an intelligent young man that worked underneath someone who got things done. Jon has seen the results of working as Petyr Baelish did. Petyr employed methods that could be considered unsavory and Jon saw and learned. However inside him is the same boy you spoke about. The one who wanted to bring about change for the better. His ideals may have dulled and dimmed but theyre still there. Theyre slowly waning like a candle with a wick that needs to be replaced. Once the wick has burned away the candle will remain but it will become much more difficult to have the candle blaze once more Corlys paused and chewed the inside of his cheek for a moment before continuing.Jon has served me faithfully during his time here and hes done so at great personal cost. You know the price the Crown exacts on those who serve it. The weight of the Realm is something you know better than most. I will carry this weight upon my back for as long as I am able for it is my duty and duty is heavier than a mountain. Once the Realm has bled me dry it will pass onto my son. I know this and I try to make a better world for my son so the weight he will one day carry will be lighter than mine. The apprehension you have for letting your son become entangled with the Crown is understandable. Through Petyr hes learned to accept the world for the harsh place it is. That friends will become enemies and some wounds are too deep to heal. I mean to teach him that all of that is just one side. Yohn that is what I see in him. Hes someone I can teach and help that will in turn not only help me but my son as well. Aerys is someone that can complement me in so many ways but Jon is someone whom I can complement. As the two of us grow we will help each other learn from the mistakes of the past and mistakes that we will assuredly make.There was much that happened during your time as Regent and yes the CoHands set up by my brother did not work as well as Im sure he intended them to. Here is the difference between then and now. I want you to mentor Jon and teach him over the next few years and then let him take the reins. The world is a dark and cruel place but there are those who bring light with them. There is much I will ask of Jon in the days to come as I work to heal the Realm. Have no doubt that theres blood on my hands blood that Ill never be able to wash away. However I will not allow that blood to have been spilled in vain. The Realm needs you Yohn. I need you will you not answer? Corlys finished letting the silence in the room grow. There was a weight to this moment something Corlys could feel but not understand. He thought he felt a pressure building as he waited for a response.,IronThronePowers,czeas5n,1,t5_361bq

Chanton nodded standing from the kneel and stepping over to the stallion a groom had brought over. In a fluid movement he mounted the animal and looked down to his cousin. Meldred Merlyns heir and daughter has died. There is rumor of dissent in  Pebbleton and no declared heir. Youre in charge here while I attend to matters. I will send word as needed. Without waiting for a response he wheeled around and shouted to the patrol beyond the gates. Ride out! We shall bring up the rear. Clods of mud flew through the air as a dozen horses made their way to a canter. First those outside the gate left then those within began to filter out at a trot before picking up the pace. Chanton nodded to Drifa and Rengar before nudging his beast to follow. Half a dozen riders formed up behind the three as they made their way to the port.Once they were well on their way he decided to broach the conversation once more. Have you thought any more about what I asked you my lady? Chanton called to her over the sound of hooves.

6415019,0,t1_czij8en,Ser Noble paused to whisper in her ear. It has certain charms not all too unlike your husband. Returning her kiss he used his fingers rough and calloused from years of hard labor in the field of battle the training yard and quill use as he slowly and methodically played with the lips of her entrance as he stimulated her breast with a firm and secure motion as his fingers danced around her areola teasing her nipple. He continued this for a few minutes until he slid a single finger his middle finger into her as he used the the area of the joint between the finger and his palm to gently and briskly pinch her clitoris. He continued this for several minutes until stopped abruptly. Looking into her eyes her lifted his finger the same one that had been in her and with his tongue wiped the finger clean as his teal eyes never broke contact with her green orbs as a cheshire grin spread across his face. Kissing her once more this time by taking her shoulder and turning her to face him he lifted his bride into the bed the fire roaring behind them warming the room well enough. His kiss soon left her mouth as he left a trail of powerful passionate and lust filled kisses down her neck to her collar bone stopping as he paid mind to her breasts before continuing his journey down to Amereis nethers. A single taste wasnt enough it would seem. Ser Noble played with her entrance with his lips and tongue kissing her region as passionate as he had the rest of her. His teal eyes stared deeply into her green orbs as he finally slipped his tongue between the lips to its fullest length using it to create waves with his tongue contorting it to different shapes as he continued to feast upon her womanhood as though he was a starving man as he used his top lip to massage her clitoris. ,IronThronePowers,czitmmn,1,t5_361bq

He remembered Jenn and wondered how their children wouldve been. Once upon a time thinking about her hurt like a knife scrambling his brains but the pain was gone. Looking at his squire and his page made him happier than all the tournaments he ever won all the battles he ever fought all the alcohol he ever drank. It even made him happier than the Stormcloaks being reformed and thus he wondered about his future. He would probably die in the icy wasteland beyond the Wall but he was sure Galad would protect Richard. Richard what do you think the wildlings look like? Asked Galad. A sailor told me they had big fangs of stone and claws made of ice harder than iron! And he said that their stench was so bad a grown man would faint after the smallest sniff!

6553854,0,t1_czx5lx6,Benjen sighed he knew this might comegt Your Grace King Corlys Targaryengt The North answered the call and acted as I saw was right. Immediately after we received the cries for aid from the Watch the North mustered and marched for the Wall being among the first to reach Castle Black. I myself was involved in fighting elsewhere and before I could reach and assemble the forces of the North I received word from you that all men under my command should be give over to Daeron Velaryon. I therefore complied and sent forward word to the Wall that all Northern forces there should join with his forces. However Ser Velaryon abandoned the Northern troops and rode off with his cavalry alone leaving the North troops leaderless and awaiting orders.gt I therefore decided I would take up control myself again and follow the Crown forces perhaps to reunite at the Wall and discuss our plans. I reached Eastwatch where I offered to march with the forces of the Westerlands to no avail before travelling on alone to Castle Black. There I summoned the Northern lords and gathered together our forces.gt We had no knowledge of the other forces intentions. No ravens had been sent us of the locations movements or plans of the other forces which I then assumed must be North of the Wall. If I had been consulted I would have replied thus Marching beyond the Wall is unwise and unjustified. To march north of the Wall is dangerous attempted even by a Northern force only a handful of times in the last thousand years. To seek out a force there in hundreds of miles of tundra while winter is coming would I thought have been a fruitless task while many of our own men died in the frozen conditions. I also believed that having hunted down the clans responsible itself a hugely difficult task given the Wildlings hatred for one another and their likelihood to blame one another for the massacre we would gain nothing by slaughtering those responsible. Even if we killed only the men directly responsible for the attack I dont believe it would stop this tragedy repeating itself. We were heavy handed not  years ago when with the help of the Watch the Lords of the North burnt back the Haunted Forest in retribution for similar attacks. It changed nothing and the Watch was decimated still worse. I know many of us have lost relations in the attacks and the wounds wrought there are hard to bear but they were men of the Nights Watch and they knew their were laying down their lives for the Watch when they took their vows. Therefore if consulted I would have advised against such an attempt to break the Wildlings strength it will not break. Instead I would have counselled restraint and bolstering the Watch supplying it with more men and arms. This is the only course of action I can see protecting the Watch for the future and I therefore set my men to reinforcing the garrisons and establishing regular patrols on the Wall. My men have not been idle your grace but have been aiding the Nights Watch and protecting the realm.gt Therefore left with forces I been told to relinquish giving orders in a campaign when I had been left out of discussions I did what I thought was best. The other Northern Lords had no part in this decision and indeed Lord Stromton marched regardless. I bear full responsibility for my decision and if a price must be paid I would pay it alone.gt Lord Regent Benjen Starkm Im not sure whether Benjen was also made aware of Valaenas letter to Castle Black where he is now stationed but if so he would append this paragraph.gt It indeed gladdens my heart that Southern forces had met with success. I am relieved at their luck in finding those responsible so soon. Nevertheless this relief is mixed with my earlier foreboding that little constructive will come of this victory. They claim to have decimated the Redbeards who they admit were not solely fighting men. They have also taken giants captive perhaps creating further enemies needlessly. I do not suggest that these Wildlings escape punishment but I again caution restraint as in the process of delivering justice your forces may bringing even greater losses on all of us.,IronThronePowers,czx7zyl,2,t5_361bq

Seems Lady Cora is out right now she should be returning shortly.    It took some time before the other guard came back only to tell them Lord Titus couldnt be found either. These Peakes... Really. He thought and continued to wait. Sooner or later they would always resurface.      It took half an afternoon before a white mare rode up to the gate the red haired Lady Cora atop it. She gazed at the soldiers with the same look Clarice would wear. Her face expressionless before she forced a smile upon it.      What ho  old chap. So glad to see you visit us its been a rough time for. You didnt need to bring all your friends though comfort from just one old friend is more than enough. The words used where a strange clash with the flat tone that was used to say them. Guard  still had a hard time getting used to it but it seemed Lady Cora was in a mood to play ball today. He inwardly let out a sigh of relief and cast a quick glance at the few hundred soldiers.       Lady Cora if I may have your permission to switch watch so as to take up my post by your side? He asked unsure how this direct approach would end. To his relief he received a rather mild nod her attention still focused on .

Dead dead and gone.Ellyn saw what had transpired but did not weep. It was her worst fears realized to watch her brother die in front of her very eyes. Her father had slipped from her fingers ill on his deathbed her mother choked on her own blood while she stared and watched in horror her friend and mentor faded in childbirth and now her brother all gone. There were no words for her despair how far the depths of her sorrow reached. In place of her brief ephemeral moment of joy there was now again the complete absence of hope.No tears fell from her eyes no words from her mouth  there was nothing. But she would not leave without seeing her brother in his last breaths long though they may have passed and she ran from her place in the stands down towards the ground where her brother lied still on the ground blood pooling around his head. Myra was absent as was Nevio and Courtland but what did they care for her brother? Monsters the lot of them the three who had driven her brother towards his death. They may have played no part but she blamed them all the same clenching her fists so tight that her knuckles turned white. What gods would allow this to happen. Why me? Why him? Jon raced to the two the Lord Orys and young Ellyn his armor clanging loud as he ran. His list had finished early and though he was bruised and battered the tall knight was otherwise fine. His eyes were on his cousins body the boy who had been like his younger brother and his tears fell freely.. The boy was too young to have gone so much life lost in an instant. His last words had been encouraging at least but could he have done more? Should he have not pressed Steffon with dreams of Knighthood told him less stories of valor? But whatever his part Steffons life was done. What would come in his passing he knew he could influence for the better.The tall knight looked up to the Marcher Lord a man he knew little with tears still in his eyes. My Lord Orys Caron he said his teeth bared and gritted. Steffon always spoke highly of you. You were his friend I thank you for that. But for now we have little time to mourn. We must speak privately.Ellyn her eyes still locked on the corpse of her brother spoke up. Im coming as well.Jon rose back to his feet his curly brown hair matted against his skin. He took care not to look at Steffon any longer  he could not bare to see him in such a state. Ellyn this talk is important. Are you certa?Yes Ellyn said tersely.

She planted the silver lemur on his shoulder and gave it a loving scratch trough the fur when the little monster stretched out his arms to her.

Im sure the lake would be a good place to look if there are indeed pirates about!       She gave a last longing look to the cryptex and was seriously tempted to try again The prospect of finding some pirate hideout was too good to pass up however the cryptex would still be there later.

7090378,0,t1_d1j85i7,Ellyn slowly rocked her legs back and forth under the chair enamored in Myrandas story. Her golden eyes looked up the young woman like a child with her troubles far in the back of her mind. The story was a sad one with a hint of melancholy and perhaps even nostalgia but it was all kept quite reserved. It was said with a dignity that the young apple had come to expect from the Lady Myranda. And even towards the end of the story there was a moral to teach her something. It was such a familiar feeling something Myranda had in common with Raeschel. A small smile crept up to her lips both sad and happy at the same time. The girl had not thought of it often but there were boys in her life. But to put them together with the idea of marriage? It was such a queer thought she had thought them friends but as husbands? It was enough to put a blush to her cheeks. I do think of a few boys sometimes Ellyn mumbled. Theres Arys Oakheart I met him at the Wedding at Highgarden. Hes a very nice boy kind but so full of worries. He has the loveliest eyes as well dark as the night sky.I met an Arrec Buckler at Cider Hall as well. Hes younger than I am the heir of his house as well. He was so boastful and bashful but so terribly bad at archery. She giggled at the last words Though I should not speak ill of people behind their backs.It was pleasant to be with both of them and she considered them dear friends but the thought of romance with them was so alien. It was not as though she would have been against courting them but it simply hadnt occurred to her. She tilted her head as she spoke Steffons never pressured me towards marriage but I know other Lords do. Its part of the reason why I love him so much.

There is no shame in defending those you love or hurting those who have hurt them. You showed strength yourself today. The Martells will take notice of it. House Dayne was stripped of High Hermitage for no sensible reason I can see and tragedy came of it. The Blackmonts failed to manage their vassal the Weyrons failed to manage their own family. Many now lie dead and it could have been prevented had the Princess not slighted you. She will know that whether she admits it or not and perhaps she will understand it is in everyones interest for High Hermitage to return to Dayne control as it was for thousands of years.Alysanne paused frowning.

Or is it just the Stormlands you distrust? He would only be reared in Nightsong for a few years and then hed be sent to his rightful seat. If the illness was such a great threat why would you have those afflicted also come with you to Highgarden yet say it is too great a risk for Grance to stay here? Youre fickle arent you?

It seems every year theres a new reason to avoid that place between odd monsters devouring knights to moronic wars. Still theres something intriguing about it. Ive heard there was a knight from Weeping Town who was connected to Septon Marcus. A thoughtful frown crossed his lips and he cocked his head sideways turning his book downwards again. Marcus looked up and took in the image of Cora wearing nothing but his shirt and the frown quickly became a wide smile. Id love to visit with you.

He had always eaten as sparingly as a bird though as he had grown older the paranoia of the years of the regency had faded and he no longer outright starved himself for fear of poison. He reached first for wine a dry Vale white its sharp tang almost herbal crisp and refreshing after an uncomfortable day spent in the saddle. I always thought the same of Corlys when he was young. Sharp as a knifes edge with so much potential. I was softer on him than I ought to have been I realize now. Because he was intelligent things came easily. He did not have to work as Baelor did and took what he was given for granted. I saw it then but I was... not much of a mentor to him. Too indulgent or too distant depending on the winds in the capital. He sipped at the wine with a strange expression but it was his words that tasted odd not the Vale white. So many children I have raised and still I have no idea where to begin nor how to correct my mistakes. It gets no easier.,IronThronePowers,d20t7u7,2,t5_361bq

7271617,0,t3_4ezoqb,Andrey had done his best in the hours of pacing and sitting and pacing to keep his worries silent as Sylva and Maester Gerion did their work. He trusted the man with his life had trusted him with it before but he could not help feel an imminent foreboding. Death had seemed to come over Lemonwood like a heavy shroud over the past few months and years. Just as the sting of Deziels loss had started to lessen the body of the king washed up on their shores and the castle was swarmed with mourning Kingsguard. It had taught Andrey to fear every unknown turn of the future.When the maester finally came out with the good news he found Andrey dozing in a chair little Cassana sleeping against his shoulder neither of them ready to go to bed on such a day. It took only the sight of the maesters smiling face to lift his spirits and a simple sentence to nearly launch him from his seat were it not for tired Cassana in his lap. You have a son. Slowly rising from his seat he made his way to Sylvas chamber. With a gentle whisper he roused Cassana from her drowsing against his shoulder. Wake up now Cass. Were going to meet your brother.Padding across the floor to quickly kneel at Sylvas side the broadest of smiles in months was spread across his face. My love. he said softly leaning in for a quick kiss having set their daughter down beside the bed. He was at a loss for words marveling at the love of his life and the small bundle in her arms. He had kept silent on his fears his hopes for a son and the fear he would never have one. He loved Cassana with all of his heart of course nothing would ever change that. But looking down on the little boy in Sylvas arms a flurry of thoughts flew through his mind drowning out his words. Our son... he finally said softly. The future suddenly did not seem so terrifying. ,IronThronePowers,d24qfej,3,t5_361bq

He answered thinking of how it wasnt long ago he and his family heard of the Kings demise. He couldnt help but wonder with the ringing of so many bells if it confused the peasants of Kayce. Ones being rung for the death of the King then rung again for the celebration of unions between so many families. Do they even care? Rodrik wondered.Though we shouldnt dwell on such things now. Not when theres celebrations to be made. Rodrik said with a grin reaching for his own goblet of wine of which he took a sip. Thats what the dead would want us to do I suppose to keep on living. Rodrik remembered her own brother had only passed last year at a wedding much like the one they were at now. He couldnt help but feel bad for the family though figured that bringing that up would only hurt his attempts at moving the conversation to a less grim topic.M Its Rodrik Crakehall shes married to btw not Tybolt.

Renly chewed on his lip in thought not noticing that hed bitten into it slightly on one side. A few drops of blood beaded up even as he absentmindedly licked them away. He was rather thin with a black beard cropped close to his jaw and only a fringe of hair on top of his head. Another detail flickered into Renlys mind and he looked back up at his mother. Also he had extremely bright blue eyes. Id never seen eyes like that before but perhaps theyre more common in Essos.He finally forced himself to take out the letters though they were as heavy as stone in his hand.

Even smallfolk did not seem eager to part with information in exchange for some coin. Much of the information gleaned from the inns and wine sinks were tall tales such as bands of wildlings who managed get south of The Wall and have taken up residence in Kings Landing. Disgusting but unfounded rumors about the personal lives of various lords and ladies doing inappropriate things sometimes in public places. The usual sort of nonsense the common folk are often predisposed to chatter about to distract themselves from their dull lives. She shook her head dismissively.I had brought three of my girls to the Riverlands with the intent of establishing contacts in that region when word of King Corlys death arrived.  Unfortunately one of those girls took ill around the same time and has also died. A frown pulled at the corners of her lips when her thoughts turned to Tanselle.

7633055,0,t3_4judno, men under Stonesinger banners had arrived to the western tower on the road from Seagard. Having been led to his seated counterpart Chanton greeted Stevron and his kin with an easy smile and a bow. The Lord Paramount of the Isles was welldressed for the road with supple leather boots as black as his soul IRL and his traveling cloak was as dark a blue as his sultry voice. The rich red curls that sprawled across the crown of his head almost bounced as he inclined his head slightly. Lord Frey its a pleasure to finally meet you. Ive been eager to take you up on your offer for some time. Two lords who some may have said twenty years ago were of no consequence A pause And yet here we are.,IronThronePowers,d39u4v3,2,t5_361bq
7634183,0,t1_d39umrz,Chantons gaze followed to the towers as they were pointed out making a note to do what Stevron could no longer. He smiled faintly in acknowledgment more than anything. Many of the lords of the Isles have... polarizing history. A fact perhaps that led to their inability to curry favor amongst themselves in the moot. His voice bordered on a boastit was no mean feat to bring a house from unlanded to lords of their domain in  decades. He said nothing to the remark of Kings Landing. Hed visited the capitol infrequently and with as many years as Frey had on him it very very likely have been a whole different world.Duty calls Chanton dismissed the apology with a shrug as they he walked alongside the wheeled Lord. I would have taken you up on your offer sooner had other matters not intervened. In any case I believe such an arrangement could be found. As they reached the pavilion he came to a stop not far from where Stevron had. His gaze skipped about the pavilion observing the place with a neutral expression. Stevrons question brought his attention back to Lord Frey and the smirk he gave him was sly. Does the sphinx give all her secrets? A pause and his expression grew more serious. I had sought marriages with other Ironlords for some timewell before there was any consideration to call a moot. For stability for power for connectionsmy family had only recently been landed and even more recently become high lords and if it could be given in the blink of an eye so too could it vanish. His hands clasped behind his back as he thought back to the moot itself. Harron Harlaw had been a poor ruler whose inaction was only occasionally interrupted by even poorer decisions. The decision to reave Starrfall on a rumor the decision to leave the Isles undefended and what served as his downfall the decision to notify the Stormlords of our intention to form a base in the Stepstones. Between the alliances already built and the inadequacy brought to light it was a remarkably onesided decision. ,IronThronePowers,d39yqo5,2,t5_361bq

7664113,0,t1_d3d9ts2,Rella Bolton the regent of Highpoint approached the dais with a straight back and a graceful gait highly appropriate for her new station. She was a stranger to these halls but she was no stranger to ladyship. For the majority of her life it seemed her purpose was to be shuffled around to rule where men had failed to rule first Harrenhal and her doomed husband then Bear Island where she had served as her brothers representative now Highpoint in her nephews stead. She was the eldest surviving Bolton now nearly the last of an era. These thoughts weighed heavily in her mind masked by a perfectly neutral expression as she closed the distance to the high table. The lord before her was powerful and experienced no doubt but as her moonlike eyes raked over him calculating his features she noted every boyish curve of his cheeks.Lord Stark she said inclining her head and dipping low into a practiced curtsy. Her red silk gown rustled on the floor and shimmered as she rose. It was a gown she had worn in her youth at the Dreadfort. It fit her the same then as it did now gathered as it was at her waist still slim despite her fortyseven years by a black leather band. She was not an old woman and wouldnt drape herself in old rags. Her hair was still black and thick and her face unmarred. She attributed it to a mastery of her features an unwillingness to allow emotion to pervade them. Her voice was sweeter than one might imagine. She continued with a light smile at her liege lord. We met briefly at Bear Island though you have no cause to remember my face. I am Rella Bolton the one who has been so graciously charged with the regency of Highpoint. Her eyes diverted then to Lord Bowen ensuring that he had caught her introduction. Lord Bowen my nephews regret that they could not be present here today the administration of their lands precludes them from the festivities I am afraid.She stepped closer towards the bride revealing a small velvet pouch that had been concealed in her hands. As you know it is customary in the North that wedding gifts reflect something of the houses to be joined together. Dustin and Bowen an axe and a stump it is very fitting to be sure but perhaps not an... appropriate omen for a marriage. She smiled sympathetically at the bride. I had this made by a fine craftsman in Highpoint lady Dacy. Your husband may carry an axe on the battlefield but now you may carry one close to your heart.unightwing uccolfax,IronThronePowers,d3dd6ql,1,t5_361bq

Remus chimed in with a serious tone. There are two ways around the mountain the plains to the right and through the forest on the left. The forest will be hard to fight in if the enemy gets there first so we should go around the long way. He looked at his surroundings.

7977583,0,t1_d4cl2vs,MyraMyra rose to her knees on the bed and made her way slowly to where Arya straddled her brother. The faintest bruise appeared above her shoulder where Aria had bitten her. Her young flesh was otherwise without blemish in that candlelight.She reached her hands about Arias head her delicate fingers drawing fans of her goodsisters red hair to lay upon her breasts. She played at that for a long moment in the silence. The only sound was the guttering of a candle burning out. When she finished she lay a hand upon Arias cheek and pulled herself closer until their nipples nudged one another.It is as you say goodsister an act of love unparallelled. As she spoke she brushed her thumb down Arias lips. I understand the pain. I like the pain a sinful smile spread about her face. The teeth the choking the ravagingI will have more of it certainly. I understand this game at last I think. I understand that desire and shame are so often bedmates as are pain and pleasure. And for that reason I trust that you understand that when I refuse I do not necessarily wish you to stop. Myra gazed into Aria meaningfully watching her meaning take hold as the woman returned a sinister smile. At that Myra turned from her stretching out to grasp the knife from where Aria laid it by. As she did she swayed her hips slowly deliberately inviting Aria to glimpse her sex. Myra rose twisting with blade in hand studying it in that dim light. She gave Aria a knowing smirk and lay the flat of the blade upon her collarbone. I could take a lock of her hair she thought. She would permit me. But with a whimper of her heart she realized that could not be. There would be no record of this night. There could be no record of this night save for the details that Myra studied and painstakingly recorded like a maester copying a manuscript.She slid the flat of the blade slowly back and forth upon Arias collarbone. Based upon her grip and the languid motion of her wrist it was plain that she was no master of the blade but she was not wholly unfamiliar with it either. My brother is a tough boy she said and flashed him a grin his violet eyes studying her intently. And you are a hard woman. You are blooded warriors both. But I... the cold steel slid down Arias breast slowly the flat of it coming to rest at last on her nipple. But I am a soft young thing she said staring at the dagger against her goodsisters flesh. A delicate and proper lady. And while I may lust for my own degredation... Myra looked up at her again her expression the same as it had been in the bathconsuming longing given to lust entirely. I simply do not care for knives.Myra lifted the blade from her goodsister and flung it carelessly into the corner skittering.AerionTheir rutting took them nearly to dawn. Myra was rather fond of their last position but insisted instead that she be on the bottom provided that Aerion would finish himself upon her and not within her. It was a request that Aerion granted eagerly. And after that it was Arias turn. And when that too was done Myra took Aerion in her mouth to clean his seed from him and did the same for her goodsister.Aerion did not take part each time however. He permitted his sister to explore his wife on her own and contented himself to watching as he cleaned the blood from himself or as he sat warming himself in a robe cup of wine in hand. Again his mind returned to when they might next enjoy another woman together. They will be in short supply at Bloodstone to be sure he thought sighing inwardly.When Myra and Aria brought one another to climax for the final time he strode to bed unbidden and disrobed. He mounted his stillpanting wife once more came quickly and then collapsed beside her. He awoke groggily in the false dawn but did not move. The candles had all but died away. Aria and Myra still stirred he saw but they were not fucking. Instead they held each other their bodies still naked atop the silken sheets. He could hear them whispering to one another and giggling like girls. But he could not hear their words. He did not want to. It was their moment he knew. What they had to speak to one another could not be said in any other place. It could not be said at any other time. It was not for Aerion and he would not defile such a thing with selfish curiosity. He watched them there as long as he could until his eyes fell shut again.Aerion was the first to wake that morning and found the hour well past sunrise. His wife and sister lay apart from him still only partly covered with Myras head resting lovingly on Arias breast. He robed himself and set out into the hall locking the door behind him. He took a wicked delight in thatlocking up his women like some depraved king. And with that he set off for Maester Brandons quarters. He showed the man the long scarlet slash and the maester was flustered entirely.Aerion shrugged. My Lady of Hammerhorn is...spirited was all he said.Maester Brandon took his meaning at once and waved at him to close his robe. By the Seven Aerion that appetite will get you killed one day. He sighed. The son of a queen. He told Aerion he would have no need of stitches and handed him a jar of green poultice to pack the wound and a small roll of sheeting to dress it.Aerion returned at once to his bedchamber turning the iron key as slowly as he could. Within the smell of their sex was overwhelming. He closed the door behind him smiling.The sight that greeted him was familiar now. Myra was upon her knees her mouth slowly servicing Aria who appeared to still be awake. Myras full round buttocks were the color of milk in the morning light. Below he could spy the lips of her sex and below that he saw her bare feet folded beneath her as if in prayer. Aerion approached quietly but she heard him all the same wagging her ass quickly as he approached. He disrobed and lay his hands upon her the silky flesh of her hips cool to the touch.Dont wake her brother she whispered over her shoulder. He looked at Aria laying there languidly.Oh I doubt theres a chance of that he said. He knew his wife was well awake of course clamping every part of herself in restraint that Myra might have this thrill. Aerion pulled on Myras hips and drove himself within her ready cunt slowly gently. Myra bit down upon her own fist. He repeated the motion almost silently and then withdrew entirely his cock thoroughly wetted. He then lay it between his sisters buttocks and teased back and forth.Not there she rasped at him.Come now Myra he said. You were wagging it in my face all night.Myra thought upon the prospect biting the tip of her thumb in sinful contemplation. Will you be cruel to me? she asked a hint of concern in her voice.Aerion smiled down at her. Of course he said.Myra did not assent. Rather she simply blushed and returned to her work on Arias cunt. Her ass inched slightly closer to him as she arched her back and relaxed herself. Before he even began she splayed her fingers across the sheets and clutched them in great fistfuls in ready anticipation.Aerion seated the tip of his cock gently in the desired place and studied his sister inch by inchher ass and the dimples above them the narrowing of her full hips as they became her waist the delicate ribs the notches of her spine leading up to her slender neck and that great sea of raven hair that undulated with her labor.  Then he saw his wifes eyes open and a smile spread across her lips.With Arias eyes in his he breathed once and drove himself within.Tasteful fade to black.,IronThronePowers,d4cr7zq,2,t5_361bq

8034089,0,t3_4p957u,Martyn Mullendore the lord of Uplands was the lone Mullendore to make the small trip to Oldtown. No need to bring his whole family for a simple meeting of concerns. Especially since he didnt really have any. He wore his white and orange outfit that was topped off with a sash with butterflies stitched into it. As he used to be a warrior his broad body still showed hints of the muscles even at his age. With his regal grey hair giving him a heir of wisdom and experience. The last lord of Hightower had left this world leaving a boy as the new lord of one of the biggest houses in the  kingdoms. Martyns guess was this meeting was to make sure no one took advantage of that fact. Jaremy was firm but Martyn didnt mind. It wasnt easy to rule least of all a house this large.Martyn smiled and relaxed in his chair at the table. He looked over all of the lords present. He had seen most of them at recent weddings and tournaments which were in abundance thanks to the summer weather. They never voiced any concerns from Martyn experience so it was interesting to see if they had anything to say now. Martyn watched Humfrey walk around the table pouring everyone cup. When he reached him Martyn simply smiled and nodded at the gesture. As he began his speech Martyn held up his  cup of wine up for the regent. Gold was indeed flowing since Martyn moved his business into Oldtown. It was a good deal that was paying off.As Humfrey went on he talked about the idea of having people ward for the Hightowers. Both his granddaughters were far too young. However the idea of squiring seemed to peak Martyns interest. His brother had adopted a child named Dorrick who was young and strong. He was already staying in Oldtown with Ulysses watching the shop. With that Martyn began to speak.I believe my nephew Dorrick Mullendore would be a perfect squire. He is around  years ago and is already training in the sword. Taking lessons from a Kingsguard would be a valuable lesson. As for any concerns I have none.,IronThronePowers,d4j3vmn,4,t5_361bq

8102163,0,t1_d4qjwsn,Once Clarice had finished with the ceremony she was almost ready to quit the wedding altogether. Big green eyes stared outward over the feast hall the young eightyear old lost among the seas of older more experienced men and women. House Meadows was not a large House and took their seats close to the back as per her fathers advice. She wasnt too prominent and she didnt want to be. The few that came up to her were members of Houses more minor than her own with names she didnt understand. Some even seemed upjumped merchants though she doubted that was much the case.Dressed in a soft gown of white and green Clarice looked every bit like her mother. Vines of embroidery wrapped around her bodice snugly the flowers of her house each in different colors along her modest neckline. Her red hair was wrapped neatly in a bun atop her head packed together save for a few dangling strands that rested beside her head framing her thin smooth face. Sitting she looked almost as tall as some of the other children of the hall but she didnt come to match them  she was short after all and quite skinny. She was an outcast. At least she felt that way.So thats why she ate in silence her eyes darting here and there observing whomever she guided her eyes to. Soon she would be going home. Soon the daughter of Raeschel Meadows would be able to relent and forget about her duty to her House. Eyeing Ellyn Fossoway for  Ellyn Hightower rather for just a moment she looked into the girls eyes with some sadness. Was this how her own marriage would go?

His stature was still shorter than hers as he had not yet begun growing taller. Books are meant to be read just why would you want to discuss it? Its a book. You read. In your head. He tapped his temples. Am I the only one who sees this as unnecessary? Dedicating almost an entire day. If I wanted to be lectured at I could just go see a maester. Jorlyn rolled her eyes. She would not expect him to understand the value of this book club. It was enrichment for the mind and creativity for the soul.

When shed lain with Aria and Aerion it was clear that Aria enjoyed laying with Jeyne and her husband almost equally but there had been a certain fervor in her eyes when husband and wife fucked. Jeyne had never felt particularly close to any man like Aria or Kiernan perhaps that was where she and Loras were different from others.If you hadnt promised Marq that we wouldnt lay together any more Id have a half a mind to show you how wrong you are.

Crownlander works alongside Ironborn serves alongside Stormlander he continued. Only now the Dornish have withdrawn scant months after a Martell replaced a lord willing to stand side by side with the others. A waste. At the mention of old wounds Valarys violet eyes locked onto his nuncle. Even without knowing the purpose behind his visit the older man had a knack for hitting nearly straight on at one reason. Lucerys the Sunglass said quietly. Do you believe all such wounds can be healed? Or even should be? Asha Greyjoy is on Bloodstone.

8661076,0,t3_4yjnq9,The Velaryon orphanage was not a particularly grim or foreboding place. It had neat plaster walls and a verdant garden that lay behind a wrought iron fence the longer one looked at that fence however the more one had to wonder whether it was meant for the childrens safety or merely to keep them locked in. In faded script Queen Rhaenas Orphanage was written above the door the name was all but forgotten now. If it belonged to any queen it was the Good Queen Aelinor they venerated.With the door cracked Alyn was greeted by an odd sight in the spacious atrium two people sat at a table playing cards one a guard in Velaryon colors and the other a portly matron of perhaps forty years her hair mousy and streaked with gray rosy cheeks flushed. Though the both of them seemed comfortable there was a sense that they should be out of place. This building had been grand once. Now it was full of quite ordinary people faded by time cheapened with dust and cracks in the stucco.The womans head perked up before the guards she had keen quick eyes that pierced through illusions quite well trained after years of looking after urchins and ragamuffins. Wots it eh? WhosHes a proper noble Clara watch yourself hissed the guard in a voice with a good bit more gravitas than the womans. She cleared her throat and rose to her feet. Her full height was rather unimpressive and she wore her weight like a bulldog all jowels and stout limbs.Pardon ser the woman managed frowning a bit. Tisnt often we have visitors unannounced.

He couldnt quite grasp everyones fascination with the weather yes they had storms but it rained in all of the Seven Kingdoms.

It was simply that the memories of the recent upheavals were far too fresh for people to easily forgive the central part the two played in it all.I... well no. Joanna raised her hand instinctively placing her palm across the back of her neck as she pondered what to disclose. We were wed a little later on. It was a strange tale. We were never meant for each other. Well not according to my father. But thats how things happened. She sighed and glided over to a chair to sit. Why was she telling Jorlyn all this? She rarely told anybody. She had not even told Lorent even when he asked.Young love is a beautiful thing. Adrian and I shared that but it also brought with it some uh complications. I dont know if your rushing a marriage is a wise decision Lorent. I dont know if you feel it is rushing at all Jorlyn. But maturity is important. Love ripens with age but spoils if you are impatient with it. Joanna knew that these werent the words Lorent wanted to hear. He was enamored with his betrothed. But even so he had to be cautioned. She saw the unhappy marriage that her brother and Jocelyn had. She did not want the same for her nephew. He had suffered so much and deserved to be happy.I... dont understand.

Despite a great deal of protest he conceded to the maester and midwives and had taken a seat outside the door. He did not think it would be a long wait. But dawn came and went and still she was laboring. He sat hunched over with his head in his hands as close to the door as he could be. At noon one of the servants brought him some sort of stew in a trencher of hard black bread. He had managed nearly half the stew before throwing it up his fear getting the better of him.With every scream or pained groaning he felt an invisible dagger plunge deep into his breast and give a merciless twist. Every time he tried to enter the maester gave assurances that everything was going fine and that he would only get in the way. If she had called his name he would have burst through the door and killed anyone who tried to impede him. But all he heard were murmurs and pained cries. Finally two hours after noon he heard one last painful cry so terrible that he nearly sprung to his feet to force his way in. Before he could he heard a new sound. The wailing of an infant. He slumped back down in his chair feeling his nerves loosen for the first time in hours only to be bound up again with fear for if Serenei was alright.The midwife who let him in after what seemed like a concerning amount of time managed to quell his fear. Her grace is well was all he needed to hear from the woman. He moved past her without second thought and entered the chamber.The scene was a mess with bloodied disheveled linens and rags being gathered up and removed. The air was warm and humid with steam still coming from a basin of hot water at the foot of the bed. Those present bowed to him wearily and unless otherwise needed made a hasty retreat from the room.Next time he would be beside her. The maester and the midwives could be damned he had not promised his queen that he would be on the other side of a wall while she suffered for him. She was sitting amidst the chaos propped up by feather pillows the babe in her arms. Her hair was disheveled and sweat was running down her brow. She was still bare beneath the covers and her heavy eyes betrayed just how exhausted she was. Yet to Vaemar she was more beautiful than shed been at their wedding. He made his way to her side. The days ordeal had left his face pale as snow and his hands were red from being clenched and squeezed together for so many hours. He lowered himself gently sitting on the side of the bed and putting an arm around her bare shoulders. What have we got here? He whispered playfully kissing her forehead.,IronThronePowers,d776d4k,4,t5_361bq

8888318,0,t3_51zvi2,hey so glad to have you but wanted to let you know pennytree has a very specific history in this game! its been fought over many times by blackwood and bracken with its sept eventually being burned allegedly by blackwood. that was about thirty years ago its been in bracken hands ever since though every few years blackwood invades and tries to get it back.it was given a town charter recently and as a claim it would have a mayor instead of a lord. i think that means you could still play their family and stuff but theyd be smallfolk basically. you should ask the mods to be sure though.tully was deposed and hoster tully has been dead many years before it was given a town charter so it also doesnt make sense that the family would be raised to lordship by him. in general the tullys are very unpopular in Bracken lands.the faction that got rid of tully is called the riverlads and includes Bracken your old liege lord Damaran your new liege lord Whent Vance of Atranta and Wayfarers Rest and the extinct house of Darry. Pennytree has been controlled by them for decades so youd probably be part of that group too.once your on slack me or other riverlads can fill you in on some of the details of the region and its history. ,IronThronePowers,d7g90ko,1,t5_361bq
8888993,0,t1_d7dfyhj,If it is stories of my own you wish to hear I might have one or two that you would find suitable. Gil said with a weary smile. Though my most interesting story would come from outside life in the Vale from when I was Master of Laws for then a newly crowned King Rhaegar Targaryen. He stopped to see if the boys would be interested in such a story and judging by their reactions they very much were. Dorne had just declared that they would be breaking away from the Iron Throne and forming their own kingdom due to the treatment they received from Rhaegars father the mad King Aerys and I was tasked to travel to Dorne to resolve the issue without war. I was still a young man then not even past thirty years old at that point but I had no idea what to expect when I arrived in Sunspear. With me were Hoster Tully Ser Arthur Dayne and Lady Alysanne Dayne former wife of Lucerys Velaryon. A small part of me though that the Dornish would kill my party as soon as we arrived but thankfully my fears were for naught. When we arrived we were greeted by a small delegation of Dornish lords  styling themselves Princes and Princesses and a kingdom of their own.The negotiations were very tense and took many hours to get through. The King had authorized me to offer the Dornish a spot on the Small Council which we hoped Delonne Allyrion would accept and a betrothal between the Kings son Corlys and House Martell. For a long time I thought that the Dornish would not accept the offer many of them seemed reluctant to accept offers that did not benefit them but in the end after some threatening and further negotiations he left out the flagship that he left in Dorne as a part of the deal they saw reason and agreed to drop their plans to become an independent kingdom. If they had not Im afraid we would have seen the bloodiest war since the War of the Ninepenny Kings.uMetalfros ,IronThronePowers,d7gbxlu,2,t5_361bq

It seemed as if perhaps she had planned the whole situation expecting Addam to give the answer he had given. He should be waiting right outside for you if you are willing. Ellyn sat up and walked towards the bottle to fill her cup once again with cider. It was then that a knock was heard. Come in Ellyn quickly responded to the knock.Slowly the door creaked open showing a tall man with a strong build  coming through the door. Ah here he is. May I introduce Jon this is Ser Addam Addam this is Captain of the Guard Jon.Jon sized the man sitting in the chair and nodded. My lord.Ellyn smiled. I took the liberty of teaching him how to speak like a highborn dropping those silly mlords. She looked at Addam. Do not perceive it as me looking down on the common folk I simply wanted him to adjust in a greater manner to the situation he was put in.Jon smiled for he was thankful for the effort Ellyn had put behind his education. Not many of his kind got this sort of a chance. Well I shall let you two get acquainted. Ellyn quickly followed.Jon awaited for Addam to leave them room and started talking. Lady Ellyn is truly generous my lord. She has given me an opportunity not many are privileged to see in their lifetime. May I show you to the armoury? So you can say if it is good enough of course my lord.Jon guided Addam along the halls taking him to a room filled with old weapons and armour. It is all rather old it seems that Cider Hall has not seen war in a while. I was thinking perhaps my lord that you could give a little input on our situation. I can show you the routines for training we have for the guards or perhaps something else you might be interested in my lord.

My father taught me well enough and I shall trade in whatever my patron which might be your liege tells me to deal with. As winter is coming a shortage of food is to be expected.

Food will still sell and I know how to trade and haggle for good prices.I would request a rather large patch of land I want to believe I will be successful and I will be able to get enough money to also create an inn a good place for a merchant hub shich shall stand tall and proud. And while a small room might suffice for a young man and maybe his wife I happen to plan for a house in the plot that will raise a legacy.

Fearing the worst she abandoned the Sept and ran towards Thiqis chambers.She knew something was wrong even before crossing the gates. The way the servants looked at her as if apologizing for something.

The girl calmed as soon as Sandra was passed to her her eyes softened and her attention fixated completely upon the infant. Joanna waited a moment staring at the girl a bit longer before sliding out of the bed and reaching into the crib. She held Denys in her arms making sure to slide him out slowly to avoid waking Donnel. The plan had been Joannas and though Lorent agreed to it he had little faith that it would change anything about Jorlyn. That young Lord was no longer so young but a man grown. But even so despite his good rule he grew more melancholy each day closer to a depression that seemed all too common in the Marbrand family. Lorent was near breaking Joanna could tell. He lived with no purpose and though his face glimmered with hope at every mention of his wife his dull and dead eyes told a different story. He may have been in the prime years of his life but it was clear Lorent was dying of grief.Tomas Joanna said giving the boy a false name as she settled onto the bed sitting directly opposite Jorlyn. And the other she named after Lorent she continued keeping her voice slow and calm for fear of driving the girl into another one of her sudden frenzies. Joanna simply cradled the young boy in her hands as she stood and walked around to face Jorlyn.

9683729,0,t1_da5xgm1,The evening was waning when Clarice Meadows stood and made her way to the center of the feast. Amidst it all was the sound of drunkards and lonely men and one smell was more prominent than the other. Despite the orange haze of the feast hall and the revelry that had accompanied the booming hearths and festival music she hadnt the thought to join in. Her belly was rumbling full of aches that would go away in the morning doubtless and her gaze was lost amidst the nobility oft looking for one man or another.She had spent her time gazing at Martin throughout the feast ashamedly peering at him whenever he looked away. He was an ugly man but he was just perfect for her with handsome eyes and a perfect mop of hair. When she had realized she had loved him it had been at her wedding feast just shy of five years back now and she hadnt ever admitted it to herself until she had fucked him in the maze hedges of Highgarden. She had been reluctant tired drunk  but she remembered every bit of it to her shame.Tymon and Martin were different lovers. What one of them lacked for passion the other made up for it in sheer strength and ferocity. One spoke of love with soft kisses and the other by driving himself hard enough into her that she had cried out.Clarice didnt realize her heart was pounding in her chest until she nearly dropped the cup of wine in her hands. Her breaths came in unsteady frequent gasps her cheeks alight with fire.Come here she murmured under her breath. He wouldnt hear of course but her fingers made a grabbing gesture. Something that he would doubtless pick up on. Men were not that foolish.umetalfros,IronThronePowers,da6q35w,2,t5_361bq

The lines in the tiles were so smooth and clean and they seemed to glow in the early morning light. She stepped through a narrow arch and entered the garden and though this was her morning routine still she marveled at the springy turf beneath her slippers. Marcella held a hand to the side so she could run her fingers along the soft and damp petals of the lilies. Dewdrops covered her hand and she raised it to her lips to taste the dew cool and slightly sweet small capsules of the flowers perfume.Marcella had gone to Kings Landing before when she was a young girl destined to be the Princess Rhaenyss handmaiden. It had seemed like the greatest city in the world if one could ignore the stench but the princess had seen that vision tarnish. When Lady Maia had led the small gaggle of Sharp Point refugees toward the Rosby Manse the city had still held a certain glamor. Every golden cloak that had passed by had given her heart a thrill but she hadnt seen her brother or her uncle. Yet the city had paled somewhat and she wasnt sure why. She preferred the garden at the manse or its winding corridors or if her mother allowed it and Maxwell was able to escort her the view of the sea from the walls of the Red Keep. Maybe the only change had been Marcellas rather than the capitals. She was older more mature more selfassured. She was also lonelier.,IronThronePowers,dd0tu2o,1,t5_361bq

She had been worried that the lady might pass during the trip her brief periods of consciousness growing more irregular and less coherent and although Sarah had followed Maester Cleytons advice to the letter she had feared that it would not be enough.As she and Grance approached the hall Sarah heard hurried footsteps approaching before her daughter burst into view trailed by a servant who was struggling to keep up. Ellyn had grown so much since Sarah had last seen her and the relief at being in her presence again stunned Sarah as her daughter closed the distance and wrapped her arms around her drawing Sarah into a tight embrace.

10640630,0,t3_5s3s06,EDIT pm EST Feb  Consider this app withdrawn. Thank you.This would be a tough claim to step into thats for certain. But I think Im up for the challenge given the plethora of excellent people that would be around to help out. Ironically Lucerys Targaryen was not all that tempting to me as a claim when he first went up for applications  not because I didnt think the character had potential to be very interesting but because at the time I was more intrigued by the challenges of Vaemar or Baelon each of whom generally have inward facing personality traits. Lucky is obviously quite a bit different. Hes very extroverted very curious about the world around him  not just people but places animals the history of anything that comes across his attention and so on. That interest in history is manifested differently from his brother Baelon who would resort to study Lucky instead takes a more active role asking questions of anyone on anything that comes to his mind. Thats changed somewhat as hes grown older and hes mellowed out but he still has a generally excitable and inquisitive nature.Hes also been through some stuff in recent days that may well have some profound impacts on his personality and his tendencies to become impatient or restless. During his time in Essos Lucky started to become familiar with what it meant to actually make decisions that would have ramifications beyond himself or his business interests decisions that would impact the people around him for good or ill. During the quest to find Baelon the people that went with him could have encountered any number of dangers opening their lives up to risk. He was their leader so it would have been his responsibility  just as it was when Armistead Vance nearly drowned while they explored an abandoned sinking ship in the sea. Weve already seen an opening to a more serious state in this lore post where Lucky mused on the weight of these sorts of decisions.Lucky currently faces a significant hurdle in his relationships with his family members though there hasnt yet been time for those ramifications to play out. I am speaking of course about his duel with his aunt Valaena and the ensuing aftermath. Its my understanding from speaking with uancolie that Val is currently brain damaged and an invalid left behind with Baelon in Sunspear when Lucky went onward to the Iron Islands. At some point hes going to have to own up to what he did in causing her to enter that state and at present no one beyond Baelon and Marcia seem to know that there even is an issue.As for who Lucky is? Well he cares deeply about his family  his siblings his nephews and nieces his own son and wife his grandfather etc.  even if his brother Vaemar can often become frustrated with the different perspectives that Lucky may bring to a situation. I view him as someone who is struggling to find his place in the world trying to find a purpose beyond merely being a prince who could simply live a life of leisure if he wished. He recognizes that he has responsibilities to his family but has trouble figuring out exactly how to meet those responsibilities. It doesnt help of course that his views can often conflict with those of his family again particularly Vaemar though at least Lucky seems to understand that his cousin Valarr needs a positive reinforcing presence to help him with his own struggles.Sample lore to come in a commentNote If selected I would ask for a few days  perhaps the week  to finish up some outstanding Sunglass business before taking up the new claim. There are a couple ongoing tasks as Master of Laws that I sent people out to pursue and feel that I should attempt to see those through to a point where it would be easier to hand them off to someone else.,IronThronePowers,dddhzrp,1,t5_361bq

I know Aerion answered quietly leaning forward to place a small kiss on the womans forehead.Whoever she was in truth he continued afterwards I can see you are not the same sort of woman to willfully abandon a child. There are days actually where I prefer to think my mother perished in the birthing bed. Its easier than to think she made a choice to leave me.Another deep sigh and another labored breath followed the emotional intimacy of the moment starting to catch up with Aerion. Here he was halfnaked in bed with a woman fully nude who a few months prior had given birth to his son. A woman to whom he was not wed though mayhaps would be able to entertain that thought in days to come. Aerion recognized he stood upon a precipice though he knew not if he could turn back. Or if he even wanted to turn away to abandon this newfound affection that was building within him more rapidly than he could have anticipated. And yet as was the case for her with him he knew little about Ceryse even while his emotions ran rampant.Ill answer anything you want to know about me Ceryse he said still in the same soft tone. But I too know so little of you even with all that exists between us now. Will you tell me something of yourself? Anything.,IronThronePowers,df9by81,2,t5_361bq

Who knows what this hedge knight truly wanted?But up on the top floor of the apartments Roslyn had been listlessly flipping through a book at her window seat. It was full of botanical drawings and diagrams of seeds and flowerbuds and it was dreadfully boring so she had almost drifted to sleep with her cheek against the glass windowpane when the knock came. Her window looked out onto the street and she gazed blearily down at the visitor.And her heart did a backflip.But... Benedict had got to the door and he was speaking to Bael. Roslyn thought about flying down the stairs but she wasnt certain she could get there in time. She pressed her hands against the glass riveted and gasped when Bael turned away and Benedict shut the door.That snake of a brother! Roslyn thought then instantly regretted it. Benedict wasnt a snake he was wellintentioned but he was a hindrance to her.Roslyn waited a few agonizing moments making sure Benedict would not come back to the door and then threw open her window. The air was warm and pleasant but Roslyn didnt care. She stuck her head out watching Bael walk slowly away and panicked. How am I to get his attention?Caaaw caaw! she tried hoping hed look up at the sound of a strange bird. He didnt.Hoot hoooooot hoot? Still he seemed absorbed in attending to his horse. Roslyn let out a disgruntled noise then hoisted half her body out the window holding fast to her curtains but foolishly close to falling. She didnt even think of it so intent was she on waving her other arm in the air. If he didnt notice her this time then she might just have to shout and risk Benedict hearing.But he finally looked up and Roslyn grinned in delight.
