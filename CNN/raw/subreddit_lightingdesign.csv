469004,0,t3_1zc2xy,The reflected glow from a screen should be a soft source or a collection of soft sources.  Also keep in mind that most modern movies dont flicker continuously  there are moments of fast action which may result in a reflected flicker and moments of slow movement which may result in subtler fades.  Sometimes there are even static moments.  Having varied movement will make your illusion seem more real.  Listen to the sound cue if there is one and bias your effect towards what the sound designer is doing so that you support one another...Its partly subjective  youll try some of these suggestions until you find one you like.  Personally Ive been happy with writing an effect  its been a LONG time since my MA class so  Ill describe it more in EOS languageStep based steps some are bumps some are rapid fades some are slightly slower fades.  Some bump in and fade out some are set up viceversa and some are just straight fades. Some move low to high some move high to low.  Many of them complete their in hold and decay times before the step time elapses.  TLDR  youre looking for a wide variety of fade types.Random grouping the steps occur in random orderRandom Rate of  through Best of luck!,lightingdesign,cftkspy,1,t5_2rfak

When you program your chases you can select as few or many fixtures as you like so try to create a long gt steps chase that moves your lights around and try to match the chase button to the fixture button below it.  Also put one master chase on like Chase  that controls all of them.  Each step in each chase also has unique fadestep times as well.  Experiment with that alone and you can pull off some pretty neat stuff with that console.Also try playing with the MIXSEQ feature ,lightingdesign,ci3tk94,2,t5_2rfak

1690899,0,t1_cjs9yai,Welllll Im just throwing this number out there.  for a dongle that works and a piece of software that costs nothing. All you need after that is a laptop or desktop. This cost kicks everything else on the market easily.Or you can around  for a shitty Elation  channel scenesetter that doesnt give you many options and is well known for dying within months. You are getting what you pay for there. Not to sound mean and I generally am I would avoid skimping on these things if you want something that is going to last a while and will have little in the way of problems. If you have are going to be cheap stick with the computer software and the Enttec or Chamsys hardware and the MagicQ software. Read the reviews on sites dont be a sucker for stupid devices realize what you are paying for. Etc etc. And not to be that asshat that goes on about how he uses big consoles for theatres and arenas and whatnot but I want you to see just how costly a dedicated console costs when you start getting into bigger things. ETC Expression  a discontinued nonmoving light console from  is selling for generally .k.Whole Hog  Discontinued moving light console that is fairly buggy but is a working horse console sells for about k.GrandMA Ultralite a downsized version of a standard moving light console that is discontinued and not used super widely sells used for around .kI realize what you are looking for doesnt need those consoles but those are dedicated consoles that stand the test of time and hold value very well. Shitty American DJ Elation Chauvet etc consoles do not last and they are bound for failure. If you want something dedicated that is going to do well for what you want Im not going to tell you not to buy from them. But for the money my dongle has held true for me for maybe  years now. Much longer than my last NSI  fader that lasted about  months before randomly not starting up one day. Dedicated consoles are great for the right application. But for a dimmer pack and a few LEDs just stick with a computer software and a dongle. Itll make your life very easy.

2175105,0,t3_2jypem,I primarily tour with rock and hip hop acts. it really depends on the size of the system and your budget but the systems that I see most often are GrandMA  Hog Avo Martin and Chamsys. I have been in a few places with ETC systems but they are more theater oriented. Ive never run a Rock show on one.  If you stick with one of the ones I listed most LDs will know how to use them. If I had to walk on to a rig I would prefer MA   Hog Chamsys or Avo Titan in that order.    MA Really pricey but unbeatable in reliability and ability to customize. You can have multiple user profiles which is great for clubs if you have different people who use the same console but want it set up a different way. Also you can give some users playback only so that a they cant touch the programming.    MA Same benefits as MA but older and no longer being made. The cost for one of these would be more reasonable.      Hog Almost everyone knows how to use this. Since the hog  stuff came out the Hog  consoles are really coming down in price. The main drawback here is that you need the console  a wing to really have enough buttonsfaders for a decent rock show. Ive done it with  faders before but really really like more.      Chamsys not as popular in the states but probably the best bang for your buck. Programs a lot like a Hog so users familiar with that can figure it out. Great for reliability I havent had one freeze up on me like hogs do but I havent spent nearly as much time on one.      Avo Titan Same kinda thing where everyone will know how to use one of these. Plenty of faders and buttons on the Pearl Expert. These consoles were built with rock shows in mind.      ,lightingdesign,clgb46c,4,t5_2rfak

2576933,0,t3_2pao8o,Youve got some excellent equipment for a high school so most of what I suggest you do is learn how to use it. The more familiar you are with the equipment the better equipped youll be for designing your first show and the better youll be able to teach other people how to use it. Learn the board. ETC has an application called EOS Nomad that is identical to the software on the Element but it runs on a Windows PC. You can use this to preprogram the show or explore some more obscure functions of the board. Id also suggest reading the manual there are a few neat tricks you can do on an Element that arent widely known i.e. using a household cordless telephone to remotely program lights. Learn the fixtures. LEDs are fundamentally different from incandescent lighting in both color mixing and operation so you should do some research into how they work. You might also want to delve deeper into the different kinds of lights i.e. cyc lights vs ellipsoidals to see how they work and which would be best.  Learn the theory. It seems like youve got a basic understanding of both the tech and design parts but you really cant have one without the other and still have it look good.  Learn the show. I did a brief writeup about my process here but in general the more familiar you are with the show the more detailed and nuanced you can get with the lighting. It might be a bit early seeing as they probably wont hold rehearsals over winter break.Youve got an entire winter break to plan lights and in short the more work you do during break the less work youll have when hell week comes up.,lightingdesign,cmuxz1i,5,t5_2rfak

7493462,0,t3_4hdwkl,After using the chauvet COLORstrips I would not recommend them to anyone. If youre looking for a cheap led batten I would recommend the american dj megabar RGBA. The RGBA version is very different from the other megabars. Its a long fixture has multiple controllable cells and generally reproduces colors pretty well. The COLORstrips do really poorly at reproducing color since the cells of red green and blue are so large and separate.  If youre looking for cheap DMX I would look at rockville on amazon. The cables are decent enough quality and usually come pretty cheap. I own   footers and through  years of load in and load out only  have gone bad and I was able to repair them.Hope this helps!,lightingdesign,d2tystd,2,t5_2rfak

Even colour change shouldnt be too hard so Im quite confident that this will work out.However Im sensing it is better to get LED light tubes from all these replies and since I dont know better Im going to assume that you guys are right.

8341638,0,t3_4ttlny,Its not a MIDI controller that you need. You need a device to receive data from a computer that will translate it to DMX out to an XLR socket. I dont think your stage setter can interface with a lighting software I quickly read the manual nothing on that kind of feature.I recently bought the DMXKing eDMX pro its an ArtnetsACN device it means that youll be able to control it with any software or console that support Artnet or sACN. Once you figured out how to set up the network between the device and your PC its really easy to use. It has two variants XLR  or XLR  pins.I use it with my own custom software MaShine I develop it myself based on OLA but maybe you can find an easier solution. Ive seen showrooms using Chamsys MagicQ it may be relevant to your needs. I know that people at my school uses Millumin but its more for interfacing or synchronizing Arduinovideo outputsoundlights. The eDMX costs me about    dev  shipping  taxes  ethernet adpater to USB  POE .af compliant power supply. This one outputs or can read  distinct DMX universes. DMXKing has smaller and cheaper devices too but Im encouraging you to buy directly an Artnet device rather than a USB one as many software may not support the USB.

If you go with Chauvet you can get . So hang most of them and keep a couple of spares laying around. A venue I did an install in went all Paky for movers and Lustrs for Lekos. They had a budget of around half a million. You need to dip into six figures if you really wanna do it right. If you cant then you have to make concessions.

Picked up Lighting and Audio doing this for  years mostly centered around Theater and Dance. I junior college for theater and Psychology and eventually went to college for Theatrical Lighting Design.The question of if you should if very touchy. I ended up in this industry because there is no where else I could ever imagine myself.

9479074,0,t1_d9hh96g,Sort of... This ended up being the key documentation for me to grok this   the whole collection on that site is kind of amazing.   Based on the handprint page Ive worked out my initial problem which is how to go between an arbitrary set of primaries and XYZ space.   Specifically Ive now run into a problem that I just need to bang on for a while.   Going from say YellowVioletGreen into XYZ and then back out is pretty easy you just reverse the matrix.   Where it gets tricky is when you have more than three primaries.  For colors that are within the gamut any set of three primaries there are multiple ways to mix that color.   Theres an optimization problem to maximize the brightness of the output which is the part I need to bang on for a bit.   The problem is not just produce this specific color but produce this specific color as brightly as possible.   ,lightingdesign,d9hi079,1,t5_2rfak
9646310,0,t3_5d68pl,What I would say is if you really want to keep your flexibility but want to be able to recall several cues maybe just record those looks as subs before the event so what you get to those moments you just use your prerecorded sub instead of a cue. It can get tricky bouncing between subs and cues seamlessly unless youre really on top of it.When I have a really easy show to busk that I know the show order of Ill often record a very bare bones cue sequence ahead of time and then add my specials and color over top of that with subs. For those  values make sure that you arent recording from sub masters that are set up as exclusive. I dont know why they would be but check that.Im very much a theatre programmerdesigner though so Im much more at home preprogramming everything into cues.
