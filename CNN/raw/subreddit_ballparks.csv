943598,0,t3_24wuyz,The ushers will stop you from going to your seats if someone is batting and only allow you to go between batters. This is one of the awesomest things I have ever seen at a ballpark. Respect the ushers.,ballparks,chbjkyx,19,t5_2sm8o

How else can you explain missing heads man in yellow disappearing heads woman in white missing hands and half head person on right and a body with a beard above the neck man on left.

7213229,0,t1_d1y2ibi,The expos also played without a roof for a few years. Cleveland has been snowed out a few times already this year and has played in below freezing weather. The Bisons in Buffalo also make it work with a schedule that basically starts at the same time.The one good thing about the dome is you know there is always going to be a game but there is a whole different feeling when youre watching a game in an open air park on natural grass.,ballparks,d1y36if,2,t5_2sm8o
