606279,0,t3_2130pz,Havent read it yet. I heard it focuses a lot on his return to religion and that made it a lower priority for me.Incidentally I didnt think Mustaines book was all that great.,Megadeth,cg96qsw,1,t5_2s1dk
608098,0,t1_cg9dzm1,Oh I do I just dont care for the body of the song the intro is awesome. Same with These Boots that funky guitar and bass is smooth but once the lyrics pop up its kind of meh. ,Megadeth,cg9e6dk,2,t5_2s1dk

Marty left Megadeth in  so kind of weird they would put that as the sites description.Sadly using wayback for cached history doesnt include the same text in the webpage source ,Megadeth,co1urn5,3,t5_2s1dk

5291170,0,t1_cvnzj43,He didnt say u loved risk he said it was ironic he loves it and u think it is throwaway which is basically just another way of saying said individual doesnt like the album at hand. I think what we have here are two different bands producing two different type of music in vwrying quantities in the same genre at the same time with some overlap. You prefer megadeath he prefers metallica but they hwve some common styles.It also comes down to what country ornetate you are from as before internet connected the world bands usually focused on a few singular areas to gain popularity in.,Megadeth,cvo0bt8,1,t5_2s1dk

6310819,0,t1_cz6y4ot,Yeah its really good.  The songs are fairly original sounding too.  And they have some of the breakdowns that older songs had...come have the cadence of older songs.  People are just whiners.  This is a  star metal release.,Megadeth,cz6ywxf,1,t5_2s1dk
6313158,0,t1_cz6upns,Melt the Ice Away is on the Spotify version of the album I dont know if it made it to any physical releases though. Maybe the Pledge pre orders will have it?,Megadeth,cz78i43,2,t5_2s1dk
6367776,0,t3_426ix2,If you really liked Kiko in this album you should definitely listen to his solo music especially the album No Gravity. Dystopia is nothing compared to what hes done before.,Megadeth,czdg2se,1,t5_2s1dk
6839558,0,t3_48tnz1,Best on the album best song in quite a few albums as well. Feels like In My Darkest Hour and Promises.,Megadeth,d0rkg2d,1,t5_2s1dk

8749412,0,t3_4zwbsf,Theres no doubt that Dirk Verbeuren can handle any Megadeth drum part with ease. The man is a beast on drums and no offense to Nick Menza at all can play circles around any previous Megadeth drummer including Adler in my opinion. I feel like Dave wants his drummers to play a certain way as Im sure Drover was capable of much more than he exhibited on record and live.,Megadeth,d6zbyix,2,t5_2s1dk

9266535,0,t3_57apsy,Dystopia songs youll likely see include the title track Fatal Illusion The Threat Is Real and Poisonous Shadows. You may also see Conquer... Or Die! and Post American World. Thats six Dystopia tracks on a  song setlist or so.Then theres the usual Megadeth songs Hangar Holy Wars Peace Sells Wake Up Dead Trust A Tout Le Monde etc. The only kind of lesserknown song they play would probably be Poison Was The Cure following a rendition of Dawn Patrol.,Megadeth,d8qll19,2,t5_2s1dk

10202506,0,t3_5m1mbv,Hangar . It was the first Megadeth song I heard and the opening riff alone blew my mind . It was unlike anything I had ever heard before. Holy Wars is my no.  fan track though it might be hard to appreciate immediately.,Megadeth,dc0ieqo,6,t5_2s1dk
10281170,0,t1_dc9dbwo,haha yeah I hear you. Ive gotten a lot pickier about music in some ways too but for me its more criticizing sound and production quality where I would often not really notice it before.  For example its a lot harder for me to enjoy a lot of Megadeths also one of my favorites if not favorite depending not the day due to Daves declining voice.  It just grates at me.  I also miss how nicely produced the albums used to be and now theyre so blaring and lack dynamics though that problem extends well beyond Megadeth.,Megadeth,dc9fdnd,1,t5_2s1dk

10628539,0,t3_5qqsbl,I Have to agree with many others and choose Rude Awakening    Great overall sound    Good setlist with old and new songs and few really rare songs like kill the king and longer version of shewolf with absolutely amazing solos!!    Pitrelli and DeGrasso both really amazing and underrated megadeth members,Megadeth,ddc948s,1,t5_2s1dk

11640547,0,t3_660r2r,I thought that was a pretty cool performance tbh. I like how loose they were playing  very unique. I suppose were unlikely to see these types of rehearsal outtakes released officially for obvious reasons but cool to hear!,Megadeth,dgfgwq5,1,t5_2s1dk
