2514106,0,t3_2of4j8,There are  different types of mining locations that I have found of the  Pristine metallic variety .Asteroid Belt   Small Asteroid Cluster  odd asteroidsIn the small clusters there is usually one paladium rock which bears   It can often be found off by itself the farthest distance from the sun. It gets easy to spot. Have never found platiinum in a small belt  and have tried quite a fewAsteroid Belt  Large Asteroid clusterThese clusters have s of asteroids and  mine similarly to an planetary ring. There are many varieties of metals in varying  . What you find seems to come down to the rng that occurred when the belt was generated . They are randomly formed  but once formed the same asteroids have the same contents. Have seen up to  metal content in there and sometimes pure asteroids . Mine them like you would a ring . The ones Ive been to tend to drop you a long way way from the cluster when you drop from supercruise   kms . Platinum can be found in the large clusters.Im not  sure but I think the large clusters might occur when there are  asteroid belts around a sun  the furthest belt from the sun might be a large one   havent confirmed this  but it would explain why they are rarer to findMetallic Rings  The metallic rings seem to be usually the inside rings. They have endless amounts of asteroids and again the rng when they were generated seems to determine the make up. You can get lucky and hit something good immediately  or you can fly around constantly chipping away at the crap metals for  minutes . I think Ive mined at about  pristine metallic rings and I cant really find any sort of pattern  you have crap runs and awesome runs in any given ring .  Ive been trying to work out if the metals are better near the mining site locations in the planetary rings but I havent really decided what the outcome is yet. Two Ive tried have been in anarchy systems and I got harassed too much by randoms . Also been playing around in the part of the rings closest to the planet  but havent really seen a major difference.If I find Im in a bad area  all gallite and indite Ill usually jump out and back in to a different spot.In the end the RNG plays a big part  imo.Good luck with your pick and shovel !,EliteMiners,cmmqd5r,3,t5_3583f
2554746,0,t1_cms0vyv,Ill be honest I dont know. However a laser that mines really fast is a blessing and a curse as fragments can decay if left too long in empty space you wont get all of the fragments if you mine all  and then start collecting some will disappear. All I know is the k one isnt extremely slow or bad. I havent seen any other lasers than the k one and I also havent heard people going on about how anything but the k is absolutely amazing and that everyone should buy a premium one now.,EliteMiners,cms1je7,1,t5_3583f

I had quite a bit of luck when I started out then stopped being so lucky so to speak. I got quicker at prospecting though not stopping but prospecting whilst making passes through the asteroids. This helped speed it up a bit and a few changes of pants.A couple of other friends usually mined at the same time as me and in the space of time I found one  Platinum they would have found around three  Plat rocks. I cursed them a lot.That being said after getting my cobra mkIII and cargo slotting it out it would still take me . to hours to fill it to the brim with Plat and Palladium. I have since gone into the trading game and am currently making triple of what I made from mining in a third of the time I did enjoy the mining and worked damn hard but also learnt a lot about flying a couple different ships and utilizing all the thrusters worth,EliteMiners,cn9aowc,1,t5_3583f

2903439,0,t1_cny4ac8,Possibly related bonus problem RES points are pointlessExcept for bounty hunters using logging exploits of course.  Ahem.The reason that FD decided to flood belts and rings with pirates is because FD thinks fun comes from the following sources Risk Randomness CombatThere is however another source of if not fun per se lets call it satisfaction and that is playing a skill based game and getting better at it.Consider for instance the satisfaction gained from getting better at the supercruise and docking skillbased minigames.An example of a game which doesnt have combat but is still a lot of fun is Tetris.Now the bounty hunters complained about mining the basic thrust of their argument being that because they were taking higher risks they should be rewarded more.  And thats okay.  Its not a realistic argument but there are enough people who buy into that that Im not going to bother trying to fight it.  By all means make bounty hunting more profitable than mining.  It doesnt hurt me.  But you dont need to nerf mining to achieve that.Rather than trying to add more combat to mining it could be interesting if players can share chunks this also allows griefing via me stealing your chunks and following you around till you find a nice asteroid and claim jumping ... which is another reason you might want a small fleet of sideys on your side ...  rather they should be looking to make the skill games deeper.If you did have a fleet of sideys all madly scooping I think this would create a new skill based minigame gt not crashing into each other.  Precision formation flying?  Unpossible?  Would require lots of communication and coordination neither of which seem like an especially bad thing.So the problem with RES points is that theres no reason for anyone other than bounty hunters to go there for logging until they get a stream of hot and cold running Anacondas.Why not grant a bonus to asteroids  based on how close they are to the RES point?  That might be as little as  but even going  chunks and  for a reduction is going to greatly improve the yield for that asteroid.  As such a lone Cobra isnt going to care but a group of miners will so groups would tend to congregate around RES points.,EliteMiners,cny4kz7,5,t5_3583f

3149620,0,t3_2w7d0l,I have mined my way to a well equipped Cobra and had fun in the processHas you can see when going for PPG platinum palladium and gold the profits average around the k credits per  minutes. However I only applied this strategy after h of mining h in an Adder. At first I struggled with scooping taking a lot of time to soop all the fragments before they disappeared. Prospecting  shooting the asteroid to see what it has  consisted of flying to it stopping shooting and examining.After practice I was able to prospect without stopping and scooping was trivial and fast. I have stopped for now to experiment with rare Trading. The route I planned can yield around k per hour using the same Cobra but with  tonnes of cargo. However I find it more boring than mining.Normal trading is not for me the idea of just going back and forth between  a couple of systems does not appeal to me.I wish you luck on your journey Commandero,EliteMiners,coogdx6,2,t5_3583f
3250737,0,t1_coxoa6w,What Ive been trying recently is this.. Even with class A power and and distributor I  cant blast off all chunks before the power runs out with  medium lasers .. And I prefer a string of  chunks to go pecking at.. So I have  mediums but  fire groups also.. I can then prospect at max speed a very quick hose with  mediums lifts the first chunk. Then if Im interested I switch fire groups to one medium only that takes a little longer to blast the chunks but I never trouble the capacitor and the chunks are nicely spaced out for pecking... ,EliteMiners,coyy4e5,2,t5_3583f

I think the mining yield is progressive ... i.e. only after mining  asteroids do the higher numbers turn up. Ive never seen anything over about  though...and thats almost always gold.... which is nice but its not  palladium.The other thing about mining that annoys me is that good yeild chunks always ALWAYS seems to trigger when my refinery binshold is full.e.g. I have  full bin of gold.... then one asteroid suddenly starts producing  chunks of platinum. So i am forced to DUMP  gold... only for the PLATINUM producing asteroid to stop giving up chunks of platinum!It IS peaceful...but dayum... is it dull.,EliteMiners,cq40dp0,3,t5_3583f

4475978,0,t3_3cey8c,Avoid big irregular spinning asteroidsIf you must mine them either mine the most protruding end so that fragments will not end up inside part of the asteroid when it rotates this is bit hard to describe but approach along the axis of rotation. As in there is always one spot that will not rotate like poles on a planetPosition your ship so that fragments are not between your ship and the asteroid preferably so that if you extend a line from your ship to the limpets itll go towards empty space. This is because limpets will fly directly towards fragment and turn after they pick it up. So if asteroid is right behind the fragment theyll smack right into it.If you start losing limpets you can try to save them by not allocating new fragments so they cant drop off whatever they are carrying then try to manually pick up the problematic fragment or just move out of range. By the time they start dying its likely too late tho so just try to avoid that situation in the first place.,EliteMiners,csuv8ed,5,t5_3583f

5369135,0,t3_3ogqda,No. Prior to . the refinery needed babysitting. If you collected a fragment with new materials not currently in one of your bins you had to manually tell the refinery to process the fragment.Now in . it just processes everything unless all of your bins are part full. So the garbage ores have to be vented from the refinery bins rather than from the input hopper. Your work rate has decreased but only slightly. The most efficient way Ive discovered is just to process everything then vent the canisters when your collector limpets expire and move a few KM away to stop the collectors picking up your jettisoned cargo.,EliteMiners,cvxytte,2,t5_3583f

Thats where prospector shines from an asteroid with  Platinum you will mine  fragments without a prospector which will result in . t of Platinum butwhen prospected  with an Arated prospector it will yield  fragments or . t,EliteMiners,d4nip7z,1,t5_3583f

8951516,0,t3_518ik0,Ive only been playing  weeks so Im no expert but here is how I progressed thus far  knowing that I wanted to get into mining. ran a ton of missions got into an Adder then a Cobra and ran even more missions  primarily hauling cargo around.    Cobra got me up to around  ton cargo capacity.  Tried a little mining in that but its still pretty limited.  Kept running cargo missions until I could afford the ASP explorer.  Didnt take all that long. Started seriously mining in the ASP.  I dont have my build handy but I had prospector collector refinery and still had  cargo space.  Might have downgraded the shields to do that.  Mined in that for a while great ship btw and also used it to rank up with Federation.  Eventually I had around  million credits. At Midshipman rank I took spent  million or so and bought a Federal Dropship and made that into a miner.  Kept the ASP now its my dedicated exploration and mission ship.,EliteMiners,d7nu7mt,1,t5_3583f

9528282,0,t3_5bcxnh,I guess they didnt see the need for randomization in these. I still wish that instead of the specific cluster points asteroid belts would be a region of the system where you could drop out anywhere inside and get a much wider dispersed version of the planetary belts where bodies are only a few visible at a time but are randomized based on densities which would vary too. The clusters just feel fake and apparently they really are.,EliteMiners,d9nk8un,2,t5_3583f

10409163,0,t3_5ozq88,OP  Strictly for mingin Horizons doesnt give you much beyond surface installations as source for mining missions and resupply and of course the engineers tuning for your boat.That being said when Ive been mining the last time Ive done so from a settlement on a moons surface a large one with proper ports and all thats been orbiting a gas giant with a pristine metallic ring so Ive took off from the pad got out of orbit and already were in the ring and the return trip was also short. Payout was good and the orbital flight on the return trip broke up the monotony.Other than mining if youre mining only cause you dont know what else to do Ive found that Horizons give you a lot of new type of activity such as surface based missions like search and rescue and of course the really neat so called tipoff missions along with infiltration of bases with your SRV.Ive also done some minimalriskdogfight with my Keelbacks fighter in a normal RES area with parking the Keelback roughly km from the beacon and get into combat with the remote controlled fighter.If it gets destroyed its not a big deal the bay got its own D printer and starts to work on building another one. I think it can make six fighters if I recall correctlyIn any case Horizons is not some magic addition but it sure adds multiple ways to expand on the activities you may enjoy to play.Id advise to look up youtube videos bout surface missions and surface activities to get a general idea on what you could expect and get Horizons only if you feel like any of those things interest you beyond mining.,EliteMiners,dcny2ur,1,t5_3583f
