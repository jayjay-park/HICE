11196127,0,t3_5dcvo7,I am  done my tiny house build x..I would recommend using google to find tiny house blogs and forums.  Also using google images to research floor plans and design ideas is key.  RV forums are also great lots of old timers with tons of experience running and maintaining RVs these guys are helpful with technical questions wiring heating and cooling plumbing etc. These guys probably provide the most in depth instructions available  to my knowledge.  I bought the dvd set when i was starting out and it was useful in showing the required steps to complete a tiny house but hardly covers all the skills you will need to complete a build.The more details you can provide about what you are trying to accomplish in the long run will help answer your questions better.,smallhouses,df12fvj,1,t5_2umk1
