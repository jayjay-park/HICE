2781154,0,t1_cnk6hm6,gtand most of the time not reported. Ah the vast international media conspiracy against pit bulls strikes again!gttheres actually more documented labrador bites than pitbull bitesThere is a universe of difference between a dog bite and a dog attack. Pit bulls consistently account for the more severe and deadly attacks in the U.S. than any other breed and often more than all other breeds combined. Many studies based on hospital admissions and dog bite report data have come to this conclusion.The Pick the Pit website was created by a pit bull lobbying organization called StubbyDog a totally unbiased reliable source!. Pick the Pit tests have been criticized as being purposefully deceptive anyway. Anyone could design a similar test for virtually any other breed.StubbyDog is named after Sergeant Stubby a Boston terrier who just like Helen Kellers Boston terrier and Nipper the RCA Jack Russell were made honorary pit bulls by pit bull apologists. So Stubby a Boston terrier is a pit bull but Niko offspring of two pit bull terriers is not a pit bull. Iiinteresting.Unless you have evidence that the paperwork and photos and news stories etc. were falsified youre just speculating which is a nice way of saying that youre allowing the wrong end of your digestive system to do your talking.Please point out the mastiff in Nikos pedigree.
