8582665,0,t3_4xcic4,Its been on repeat all morning here! D I love it! Im really glad they got rid of the happyjoyjoy single recipe from the last album. Its an earworm in a way but not long as repetitive as the previous singles and it actually has some gloomy bittersweetness and quite same layers to it. In short everything i love in a Sonata song!! The vocals kinda drown here and there though and the talking at the end makes it kinda messy but other than that im loving every bit of it! ,SonataArctica,d6ef34n,4,t5_2vkwi

9195742,0,t3_568stp,it looks like Pasi doesnt really know what he wants with the mix. With Ecliptica Revisited Tonys vocals were floating somewhere lossely from the rest and the guitar was toned down to a point where it was almost inaudible. Now the opposite happened. I love the rumbling guitars in this one but it indeed sounds muddy at most of the times. Tonys voice is pushed to the back which is a darn shame because he delivers one of the best vocal performances ever on this album imho! I love this album from front to back but the mixing is indeed an issue. Not such a nuisance as on Ecliptica  and still quite listenable but this could be done way better. ,SonataArctica,d8hmmb9,5,t5_2vkwi
