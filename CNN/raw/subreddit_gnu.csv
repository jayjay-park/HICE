610884,0,t3_213vo3,As long as the source code is provided this would be fine.The servers are not free anyway I see no problem with somebody asking money to set up an alternative minetest server.IMHO the original developers should do the same and sell access to official servers and delivery of CDs for money maybe this would help the development or maybe help pay for some advertising and redesign of the website that would help bring more popularity to the game.,gnu,cg9pkcw,0,t5_2qh3i

4224038,0,t3_399nxm,I dont think that any of the things you have stated above depends on the distribution.Power management and wireless are mostly handled by the kernel and should work out of the box nowadays.For remote desktop connection you will have to install an RDP viewer. Should be pretty easy no matter what distribution you use.There are websites that only work with internet explorer?Whatever when you encounter one you have several options. It uses some plugin Flash Shockwave Silverlight that you may not have? gt Try Google Chrome or Firefox with Shumway.. Maybe the website is just confused by your User Agent string? gt Use an addon like User Agent Overrider to tell the website you are using Internet Explorer even though you are not.. Still not working? As a last resort try installing a Firefox for Windows using wine.You should choose your distribution based on whether you want an distribution which does most things for you and just works out of the box or one that doesnt get in your way as in you have to do everything yourself.Since you seem to be pretty new to GNU you probably want the former unless you are willing to spend a lot of time and effort understanding your system and working things out.I would suggest you try Linux Mint. As far as I know it has the best out of the box experience and its desktop environment is pretty decent too as in not too different from Windows to scare people off but still feels modern and has all the awesome stuff like unlimited virtual desktops.Since Linux Mint is based in Europe it can also ship video codecs so that watching DVDs and stuff just works out of the box.  Distributions like Ubuntu that are based out off the US can not do that due to legal problems.,gnu,cs1pvur,2,t5_2qh3i
6358791,0,t1_czcbn3e,Thatd be unusual.  There used to be problems with gcc being quite out of date but they usually have very recent versions of clang they contribute quite heavily to llvm  the primary author even works there.,gnu,czcf9p1,2,t5_2qh3i
6625458,0,t3_42hokn,gt Other than these two things and flash ...I always thought Flash was the first to go. Even my Open Source acquaintances purged Flash citing Occupy Flash,gnu,d04mo1r,1,t5_2qh3i
7224095,0,t3_4ebcy5,Forgetting about all the various rights issues its neat in that it seems orthogonal to cygwinmingw from a usage standpoint. cygwinmingw runs nix programs compiled into Windows .exe binaries. You could launch them from Explorer or Powershell or whatever but you have to have the source so you can compile them as Window binaries. You can even run an X server. GNUkWindows is a FreeBSDesque binary compatibility layer so it runs Linux ELFs including presumably ones for which you dont have the source. No Xsupport though from what Ive read.From a Free Software standpoint it seems like if you have to use Windows then cygwinmingw is preferable. For that matter it seems better from a practicality standpoint as well. Im kind of left wondering what the point of GNUkWindows is.,gnu,d1zbqak,6,t5_2qh3i

8999542,0,t1_d7tlbo8,No I dont and Im seeing a lot of people not liking it either most dont know what they want but they know they are against capitalism.Anyway I was just curious most anticapitalists programmers love GNU and free software so I was trying to understand why you think in here most people would like capitalism I do understand I was just trying to get your explanation.,gnu,d7tlt2c,1,t5_2qh3i
9685295,0,t1_da6ok2u,yeah but thats the iis.net page not the gnulinux.org. and the link is default.the gnulinux.org website is on a microsoft webserver product. and probably on a windows server. doesnt mean the website is in any way connected to microsoft.and it doesnt mean the mailserver of that domain runs on a windows machine either.,gnu,da6x1p9,1,t5_2qh3i
