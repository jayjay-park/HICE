647339,0,t1_cgdtczl,Simplest answer is thats just how the degrees are.A bit more complete an answer is that the number  is everywhere in Masonry and the YR degrees are no exception. The need for  Companions in the Royal Arch degrees makes a bit more sense after the Cryptic degrees but thats really all I can say.,yorkrite,cgdupi0,2,t5_2ujbb

6965321,0,t3_4b3ovi,You should investigate the history of the specific degrees in YR and their relation to early Freemasonry.  Then you can decide which degrees interest you for deeper consideration. If youre approaching this looking for a good setup and dinner Id expect failure outside of any but the most elite or selective of Chapters Commanderies and Councils. The York Rite in America including its invitational orders are among the oldest and more ancient craft masonryesque degrees out there. Personally Mark RA AMD KMs hold the most value. Youll find the prolific figures in the AASR were all leaders in the YR first. Dont judge our ancient tradition based upon the quality of dinners and social bullshit. If weighed with those standards the judge hasnt understood our tradition. Of all Masonic bodies the AASR is the most business of them including its inception in America  the most like your Scientology example but the AASR has much legit information to convey. ,yorkrite,d15us91,4,t5_2ujbb

8712435,0,t1_d6j6cb0,From the Secretary. a Companion does not need to be a resident of Washington to receive the Royal Ark Mariner Degree by Puget Sound Lodge No.  Royal Ark Mariner. The only requirement would be to be a Master Mason in good standing of a recognized jurisdiction and a Royal Arch Mason in good standing in a recognized Royal Arch Chapter. Both statuses to be confirmed by presentation of current dues cards. There is not any other prerequisite or requirement to be considered for a person to petition to receive the Royal Ark Mariner Degree,yorkrite,d6uovzc,1,t5_2ujbb
