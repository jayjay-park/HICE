5351058,0,t1_cvuumca,Autumn Games owns the Skullgirls IP in full. Royalties always go to them first and foremost. Their contract with Lab Zero Games to develop DLC for the game per the SG Indiegogo campaign didnt include anything about sales royalties for Lab Zero until summer  when things were renegotiated so that LZ would get royalties of all game and merchandise sales.,Indivisible,cvvnok0,2,t5_38x3z

Welldeserved.It would have been nice if Lab Zero kept an official gallery of all the entries since its a bit heartbreaking to pour in a ton of work and never get any confirmation at all from them but I did see that someone set up a cool general gallery on Deviant Art I suggest checking it out,Indivisible,cxo0vhh,4,t5_38x3z
