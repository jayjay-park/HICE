6892514,0,t1_d0x8lvb,You can simulate a click easily enough with the Robot classWhat I havent thought much about Ive been running errands  all day is how to best put together an exercise like this. It seems like you would want to use autocalibration to find where a screen is e.g. projection being used to show the game but then get rid of the projector arena and use the browser on that screen instead.,ShootOFF,d0xl1ql,1,t5_37hyq
11122490,0,t3_5wnmh2,I have pushed a preliminary implementation to github.  The next nightly will have a target called POI Adjustment.  ShootOFF will beep when there is a shot near one of the crosshairs indicating that the POI adjustment is being updated.  It is currently set for  shots.  If you shoot more than  times it will reset the POI and start adjusting again e.g. on the th shot it will be like setting the POI from scratch again.  Right now the POI will remain for the rest of the session but is not saved.,ShootOFF,desq46p,1,t5_37hyq
