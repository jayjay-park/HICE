8080642,0,t3_4pwbgp,The best advice agains illaoi. I tend to let her grab me and the I get myself out because I can farm her tentacles PAnother thing avoid her poke she tend to poke and get oom too quick or be absolutelly pasive on lane.And last avoid her ultimate. When she ults simply get yourself repositioned and avoid the damage once you reposition yourself simply kill her you dont even need to pop your ult to do this P,Kaylemains,d4oc889,1,t5_39pk1

9579368,0,t1_d9ts6fc,One thing I tell people about the on hit build is the damage is not random.  You have a very good idea of how much damage youll do.  Crit that leaves too much to RNG.  Unless you have like ,Kaylemains,d9tupmf,1,t5_39pk1

9785036,0,t1_da7r38g,Kindred ulti has cd of  Kayle is . And since Kayle builds cdr you can get your ulti every  seconds. Kayle is a niche pick but still a very strong champion.,Kaylemains,daj7w2i,1,t5_39pk1
9810289,0,t1_dam8h6d,Well im diamond My problem is my main champion pool is weak early and gets shoved in and poked until I have to take a bad back and then I can never kill her.

10262456,0,t3_5mme6r,I honestly think dawidsonek has the best idea with  flat cdr  intelligence for  total at lvl .  The power of having E on a reduced cooldown this early really cannot be underestimated. ,Kaylemains,dc7b01a,1,t5_39pk1
10305052,0,t3_5nihxp,Mobi boots have been good on her for a while both mid lane and jungle. Theyre kind of a forgotten item at this point but theyre definitely really solid on her.,Kaylemains,dcc4sqm,2,t5_39pk1
10329240,0,t3_5nliqm,Ryalis is an early game purchase bought as the ndrd item for most mages. Frozen Mallet is a late game purchase because its bought for the hp and  . sec slow.

10679940,0,t3_5ssrlx,I mainly use this build but I usually go for rylais for the early AoE slow then I buy rylais before runaans and better heals lt.Sometimes I feel that I have too much AS lol and that I cant hitandrun properly with Wits End so I occasionally try Rabaddon Void Staff or something more defensive like GA or QSS.,Kaylemains,ddhjzgb,1,t5_39pk1

10944962,0,t1_de8jn6l,Wow thanks for all the advice! Right now Ive usually been building BG gt nashors gt guinsoos gt wits end and then if the game is still going on I usually never know what to get Ive seen people say BotRK and void staff or some say LB and deathcap but I feel like then Id need void staff and not wits end? And only if they had a lot of squishies?,Kaylemains,de8w916,1,t5_39pk1
11079061,0,t3_5xu41g,Swain Pantheon Tryndamere irelia kennen are hard lane counters that eventually get oustcaled but snowball easily. malphite and jax are pure counters to kayle at all stages and nasus can be problemati if hes good at nasus,Kaylemains,densv2e,2,t5_39pk1

11542858,0,t3_64kewi,I usually go Nash gt Rage gt Wits gt Runaans sell wits for botrk late game and its a rush build to make Kayle hyperscale faster through cheap items. It doesnt scale as well though.  If you go the Runaans gt Deathcap gt Void Staff route it may be better to go void before deathcap if they have gt Mr sources. Lichbane   Dcap  Void Staff gt Dont do this to kill tanks thats not its job.  If you do problably Deathcap gt Void with lichbane last. Runaans  IE  LW gt If you have lots of Magic Dmg Pick up LW before completing IE if you need be. Big damage with fervor.  Botrk  Runaans  Mallet gt AOE hp shred and slow.,Kaylemains,dg4duv8,1,t5_39pk1
11567234,0,t3_652q1s,She has better matchups top lane and even though the lane is longer its harder to get ganked by multiple lanes. Mid is well.. mid. You get people from top bottom and jungle roaming on your lane because Kayle auto shoves waves. I suggest sticking to top.,Kaylemains,dg75gku,1,t5_39pk1

11790054,0,t3_686eem,Well I would never buy it against a single enemy. Probably not even . But when the team is packed with slowcc these boots are optional.I would go slow vs stuff with at least  of the likes of Ashebraumnasus etc.I go for mercs when they have at least  forms of heavy CC like malphsyndrabard.But even in those games its not always I go for them  sometimes still just berserkers.I almost always get the iron elixir lategame when teamfighting and it grants you the tenacity as well. It combines well with swift boots but not well with merc treads. One of the problems with these boots is that berserkers gives such a big powerspike where these doesnt. You want early movement speed for kiting but berserkers gives you an aggressive part as well where the others are just for surviving. That means you should buy them later but then you lack the ms for kiting. ,Kaylemains,dgwfxld,3,t5_39pk1
