8686430,0,t1_d6r41b7,They have a websockets API?Would you mind pointing me towards where thats documented? It doesnt show up on their siteI found the upload API but this the first Ive heard of websocket support.,screeps,d6rfihp,1,t5_34ioa
9054200,0,t1_d801c10,Why shouldnt I build extensions around the spawner? I havent noticed any movement affects from having them in these positions. There are no console errors and checking console.logtargets gives me the expected list of extensions and roads throughout the entire build process. Thanks for taking a look.,screeps,d80653w,2,t5_34ioa

9973827,0,t1_db6yiqz,Thanks very much. I found it weird that you can do    .sumGame.creeps c gt c.memory.role  harvesterbut not a simple    .sumGame.creepsLooks like with .size or uthpions quote below however it should be an easy workaround.Also for what its worth I found a line in one of my modules where I did something like    if creep.memory.role  harvester Im sure that many people have fallen into that trap before me... of course that should be    if creep.memory.role  harvester that double equal sign can be a killer if you mistype it!,screeps,db7m7w7,1,t5_34ioa
10019456,0,t1_dbdk27z,You can have all the roads you want no need to convince me. You were wondering where your energy went instead of upgrading and I pointed out the two things I believe you loose most Creeps with WORK parts running around hauling their own energy and roads getting not used. Mind the roads are probably not that bad especially if you keep them repaired by creep and not by tower. I certainly loose much more on roads per room than you do because I use towers.And there are plenty of reasons to keep around unused roads Preparation in case the military suddenly needs them a planned upgrade or change in code in the next few thousand ticks art...It is just worth remembering that they are not free especially unused roads on swamp.,screeps,dbdkagx,2,t5_34ioa
