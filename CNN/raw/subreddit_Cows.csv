7822017,0,t1_d3v5u61,Hi I dont want to sound rude or condescending as Im sure this will come off in the tonedeafening room that is the internet but its not as simple as that. Letting a cow hold a days milk can be very dangerous and painful for her. A prize cow we had one year made  pounds a dayimagine that kind of weight strapped to your groin and you can see why not milking her is a poor idea. Not milking can also increase bacteria and somatic cell counts leading to infections of the udder.As for leaving for the calf most milking breeds simply make too much milk for a calf to fully ingest. Its a deep hole weve dug ourselves through thousands of years of animal husbandry but not milking them isnt a very ethical opinion imo. So the most ethical answer? From what Ive seen and done after all my ag work find a local farm one that lets you visit and see how they operate. Buy from them and support them because theres a shitton of those evil bastards out there making all us look bad. ,Cows,d3v9eo5,3,t5_2rqm5
