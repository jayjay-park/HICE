877048,0,t1_ch3xvft,I understand what youre saying  and I agree with it. Im just worried with this huge growth spurt the community is going through that if we dont have set rules of etiquette were going to run into scenarios that will damage trust in the community. The average amount of players on at any given time has recently multiplied exponentially as more people are realizing that this community exists. If even  of those  people online are leeching dirtbags then were going to need some form of selfpolicing and redundancy. If not now then certainly in the near future if it keeps growing like this.Edit Blizzard needs to give communities better ingame tools. Being able to create games with options like preventing people from entering if they dont have at least  rift keys etc.,RIFD3,ch3z2tl,1,t5_31ijd
928961,0,t1_ch9toz1,As a runner I completely agree. I can carry a team of  up to torment  with no troubles but I can imagine how others would feel if they have to work harder because the th player is level . ,RIFD3,ch9vlnv,1,t5_31ijd
935778,1,t1_chafbhe,You are scum. You openly admit to scamming. You are what is wrong with this community. If you join a game expect to have to open the rift. Thats how it works. Period. So what if a group of  want to run rifts and get a free open from the community? Thats how it works. Youre not getting scammed. You owe it to them to open the rift because they cleared the previous rift and let you in for boss loot. If you dont want to open the rift for their hard work you deserve to get banned you fucking douche bag.,RIFD3,chanisg,2,t5_31ijd
936236,0,t3_24tzge,I think this is a good change.  When the community is private how do people try to join? Is it simple as finding the community and then clicking ask for invite? Or do you have to pm an officer?  If it isnt too difficult I wouldnt mind it.  EVEN if no one else could join during the time it was private we could do a  days a week private and th day open to public sort of thing so that it could still grow.  Or we could wait till we hit a milestone of people K?,RIFD3,chapedx,2,t5_31ijd
937392,0,t3_24tzge,I may not be qualified to speak as ive only been a part of it for one day now but from what ive seen the community self regulates pretty well and i only encountered one person who left and didnt return to open heshe was called out in chat and as others have pointed out the few who are trolls and leeches i really dont know why either are  rift keys really that hard to come by? are in seem to be a huge minoritythat being said i dont think think the idea should be completely forgotten because it is possible that this could become a real problem some time down the road as the community gets biggerbut until such a time comes i feel being open to all is more in the spirit of paying it forwardP.S. thank you to everyone in this community and even more so to usoylentrd for creating this and any others that had a hand in it,RIFD3,chau4qp,1,t5_31ijd
951647,0,t1_chcecn2,Lol the point is not how many words make up the list of rules. The point is what youve helped solidify. So thanks.,RIFD3,chcgkxu,-4,t5_31ijd
970716,0,t3_24tzge,Everyone is posting about how they think leaching isnt a problem.  I think I have a better point  that you couldnt stop it if you wanted to so dont waste your time and effort and reduce your community size in a fight you cant win.Preventing rejoins after a kick by requiring invitations wont discourage leaching because everyone knows there are MANY other similar communities to join.  So a person without morals would just say who cares if I get banned Ill just leach somewhere else?  And then theyll leach until they get caught so the problem isnt solved.Plus trying to enforce a rule given the tools Blizzard has for us is almost impossible  you dont have chat logs and even if you did it would be one players word against another.  So your only enforcement option is to take someones word  if you do that then you risk booting people because some unsavory types are issuing false reports of rule breaking.  Youre just creating a lot of work for yourselves as administrators of the community without actually solving the problem and introducing a new problem  liars could easily get well behaved players banned.Finally RIF is about saving time andor being lazy.  The people who want to join your community are either lazy or just want to save time or both.  Naturally they wont join your community if they have to wait for an invite when they could instead pick from  more similar communities.,RIFD3,chemosx,1,t5_31ijd
1008988,0,t3_25kvlo,This all sounds like an extreme undertaking. If people have this sort of time kudos to you and thanks for potentially managing it. Otherwise I dont see many people investing in this.,RIFD3,chiza29,2,t5_31ijd

1065379,0,t3_26b7aa,I would of opened and then blocked him. It was a dick move but burden of proof is an issue when he starts sullying your good name. Im sorry this happened.,RIFD3,chpdzr0,1,t5_31ijd

1247229,0,t3_28ddyx,I have no problem with any of them. I dont use scriptsmacros and the best ping Ive seen is ms  most of the time  year old computer and am still frequently am not the last in.Take the perspective that youre swapping keys for shards and the process is a lot more palatable even if you end up opening a lot. There is no unfair conditions for the openers this way unless youre in a game and the one that is supposed to open bails. I try to stick around and make sure they open and if they dont I do. Small price to pay for the service the runners are offering.,RIFD3,ci9xg4m,2,t5_31ijd
