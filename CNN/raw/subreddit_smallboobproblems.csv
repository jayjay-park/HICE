5042488,0,t1_cutfv6n,I have a few from Aerie that have some light lining and my nips dont show through. The ones that dont hide as well I usually just save for days I know Ill be outside in the heat and dont really think about my nipples. I should probably get some pasties though so Im not so limited p,smallboobproblems,cutt79i,2,t5_2vimr
5124171,0,t1_cv3n0la,The Little Bra Company sells some nice pushups though the bands run tight in that brand. I would recommend a strap extender rather than sizing up thats what works for me. ,smallboobproblems,cv3nkxa,1,t5_2vimr

6732795,0,t1_d0925vy,If I had a dollar for the amount of times Ive had to do stuff like this I mean I am not a big fan of the whole nipple thing since Im not sensitive there. but instead of just telling a guy what to do I just passiveaggressively because Im an aries do it myself and hope he gets the message.,smallboobproblems,d0fqa77,1,t5_2vimr
7173046,0,t1_d1o2wa5,Because if youre stick thin you cant have an under bust of  inches. A lot of places measure absolutely wrong! To get a proper fit you need at least  measurements  most places like victorias secret only use  or .... VS also measures over your boob to get the UNDER bust size.. ridiculous. You can try it yourself rabrathatfits has a really good calculator. There are explanations how to measure too. You can also google brabandproject and look up how properly measured  under busts look like  thats not what i would call stick thin. More like normal and up depending on height.Another way to tell your band is too big after you come home get in front of a mirror. Is the band sliding up at your back? My whole live i thought im a A.. bras were awful uncomfortable just ew. Turns out i am a DD... i just did the calculator for fun and didnt believed it at first... yeah... i started to look into breast shapes and how the affect bra fitting and how bras actually work before i got convinced. ,smallboobproblems,d1tiakv,3,t5_2vimr
8327343,0,t1_d5igy7k,Absolutely! Shout it from the rooftops. All body shaming is wrong but fat shaming is much worse than thin shaming. I say this is a thin woman who has been skinnyshamed but also has a brain and a heart.And feel free to cross post.,smallboobproblems,d5ih143,2,t5_2vimr

8882745,0,t1_d7fgwvd,The problems that big breasted women face dont strike them at the core of their femininity. Tall man and big dick probs dont strike men at the core of their masculine identity. Its easier for the aforementioned groups to be more content. Hell big boobs and small boob reddits have similar issues sometimes but with different flavor. Small boobs dont fill out a dress that can be depressing. Big boobs fill out a dress too much and its Ooooh look at how big my boobies are i mean LOOK! LOOOOOK!!! hehe!!!  Their problems can easily be seen as humblebragging.,smallboobproblems,d7fkwb1,9,t5_2vimr
