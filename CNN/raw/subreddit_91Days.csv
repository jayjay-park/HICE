10365649,0,t3_5odvfx,Interesting speculation and well written! Its very possible that the imagery with the stained glass window could be symbolic of the relationship between Avilio and Nero. I think thats one of the best parts of  Daysthey have this incredibly crafted story and they purposefully leave some parts of it ambiguous and open to interpretation for the viewer. There are some things we might never get a definite answer to but its a lot of fun to analyze what weve been given to draw our own conclusions. Out of curiosity do you have a theory for what happened at the ending of the show? Do you think Nero spared Avilio or killed him?,91Days,dcj0bca,1,t5_3fedf
