1529487,0,t1_cj7yz7t,I liked the direction you were taking this but I dont think this is it. Lets Look at what could and could not be changedSR?n?U?eFWT  he? henna ?V?eThe Capital Letters can be changed and lower case can not. The ? represents the current letter o.When changing the O we know we can not change it to e a or i without screwing around with Henna so only vowel it could change to is u. So we try that first but there is no word that ends with heu which comes right before Henna in this case so OgtU is out.So O is a consonant. But if we look right after Henna we see ?V? ?V?e or ?V?eS. If O is a consonant then V must change to a vowel and U is now the only option. So its ?u? ?u?e or ?u?eSBut if we are changing U and V then in the middle here we also have ?n?v? which would be  consonants in a row. I cant imagine any word combination that would work with this.,SeekingHenna,cj7zy5w,1,t5_32koq

1537739,0,t3_2buj02,I was wondering the same thing about the pluscross symbols involved in alchemical symbols. With the various clues pointing towards alchemy playing a prominent role in the institute and the video its a definite possibility. That said the course description specifically mentions algebra so it may just be that Im over thinking it.,SeekingHenna,cj913yf,1,t5_32koq
1538216,0,t3_2bu31w,Actually this seems to be a running theme. None of the courses at WW read anything like any class I took in college except perhaps for the Language courses.We have everything from the history of the  sign to studying mythological animals in the field to focusing on the works of people who died or went missing prior to creating the works in question to dream interpretation. I dont think theres a course in there that seems the least bit like standard fare at any university Ive ever seen.So I very much agree that it seems like this is by far not your standard university and instead one that prepares its students for work or study in the metaphysicalsupernaturalsuperscientific.Which...sorta makes one class stand out. The only class that seems mundane on its surface is the French class. I mean theres nothing at all weird or unusual about the class or its instructor which is something that really doesnt hold true for any other class offered. I suppose you could say the same thing about Latin but even that fits in with the study of ancient cultures. No one spoke French in ancient times as its a late derivative of Latin.So is there a significance to the Francais More than the Language of Love course being the only normal or mundane course in the catalog?,SeekingHenna,cj939dg,1,t5_32koq

1570932,0,t3_2c88bg,Hey have you guys thought that since Blake implied that the locker note is a riddle that since we should stop looking where we cant find Henna that maybe we should start looking where CAN find henna....

1575975,0,t3_2cbj5m,Melodramatic but true. Actually it might be an idea to take some basic precautions against common pitfalls for internet occult investigators. Could you please also Let us know before going anywhere alone preferably giving a time to check in with us before we should start to panic Maybe go so far as to drop one or two members of the community a key to a cipher only you know and delete the message from your outbox afterwards to guard against your account being hijacked Download a voice recorder app for your phone.

1607810,0,t1_cjhsfxy,Lexan is a trademarked name for polycarbonate products Velis is a form of a Latin verb. Might be an anagram might be a sort of red herring because names in ARGs which are from the near past invariably have to be made up.I honestly doubt its a clue though I might be very very wrong.,SeekingHenna,cjhtyp3,1,t5_32koq
1609037,0,t3_2cpob9,Not a bad line of thought. What do you think about the goodevil mechanic of the Institute being the people trying to teach students to use their powers for good and the smokeheads or some other shadowy evil entity fighting against them and trying to turn these powerful people to evil? Thats my own personal take on it Lexan seems like a shoe in for the conflicted young man role could go good or bad Bela K on the other hand could be on the other side of things. Henna might have discovered she had the power to heal starting with herself etc. Thats my theory. I havent fleshed it out in detail yet Ill likely post a thread when I do but thats what Im thinking. ,SeekingHenna,cjhziuu,1,t5_32koq
