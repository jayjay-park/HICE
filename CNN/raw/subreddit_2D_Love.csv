7952557,0,t3_4o6788,Id probably geek out HARD! I mean being in space is not something you get to experience everyday and Id love to tinker with the machines and stuff on the station draw diagrams and learn how they work and can be improved.Megumi is not that much of a geek I think in the series she starts slow but can be pretty hardcore when something catches her attention at least at the beginning so wed probably explore the place and enjoy the view. Also try the space foods to see what it tastes like.If possible get some souvenirs like rocks and gifts.And space sex obviously because itd be interesting to know how it goes with antigravity p,2D_Love,d49xxwz,2,t5_3ejkn

8430063,0,t3_4v1kq2,Thats a good question Ive always wondered what she could enjoy given how difficult to read she is. I think maybe something to help people like nurse or something low profile like secretary.Post Circle I can see her making a career in management or business for the game industry or tech. Id love to create a start up with her and I wish we could. She became a lot more driven after being in Blessing Software.Edit Oh or programmer given that she already learned scripting and seems to be pretty good at it. Cant believe I forgot that was one of the many reasons I fell for her XD,2D_Love,d5varn3,1,t5_3ejkn
9062107,0,t3_54c9do,Windas from the trading card game YuGiOh! She has more story than most yugioh cards since shes from the Duel Terminal series which establishes a plot for the archetypes involved in it. Winda was a member of the Gusto tribe. They lived among nature and animals in a place called Mist Valley and were a peaceful nation. She and her tribe worship a nature spiritgodthingy called Gusto hence the tribe name. Winda specifically was a priestess and so would often lead said worships Although  peaceful or maybe because they were under attack often so Winda and her tribe would often need to defend their lands from invaders they fought I think  other factions during the story so shes a badass as well a cute! However long story short the Gusto tribe fell to its enemies in the end most of them were killed. Thankfully Winda gets better. She gets revived as an evil puppet for one of the bad factions but eventually breaks free even more badass! and returns to the new tribe formed from the remainders of the Gusto tribe the Ritual Beast Tamers.,2D_Love,d814aun,2,t5_3ejkn
9793508,0,t3_5falf3,Probably nothing all that extravagant wed probably just get a place out in the country where we can just relax and be alone with each other without having to deal with all the problems of city life and probably just use the rest of the money to live life as normal except for occasional vacations and stuff.,2D_Love,dak9g1i,1,t5_3ejkn

11726414,0,t3_67a0jm,Theres also the progression of the IIA theory to tulpamancy rtulpas which has similarities and differences with this community and what you and Koakuma have described. In the past I have been involved in both simultaneously although my OC had a fairly strong base in canon tulpamancy unlike traditional OCs or waifuism is not static and the tulpas grow and changemuch as in your IIA theory which reminds me a lot of Soulbonding which was sort of an earlier internet predecessor to tulpamancy and perhaps waifuism too thus making them more or less OCs even though they are not consciously designed or intended to fulfill the perfect waifu role or necessarily even to have specific traits.,2D_Love,dgp7wtd,2,t5_3ejkn
