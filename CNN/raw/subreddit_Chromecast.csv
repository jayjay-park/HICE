147402,0,t1_cev6urm,Yeah thats my take too. There isnt a consistent operation experience among various apps. In Play Music for instance using device volume buttons doesnt bring up the volume bar although it does change the volume. Listening to Netflix YouTube Play Music on device speakers then casting seems to max the app volume from whatever it was.There are also kind of quirky results when you switch away from a casting app and then try to come back and regain control. I guess a lot of this is just early days in any new product probably why theyre going slow on appSDK rollout. Im supposing Google HQ knows about all this stuff.,Chromecast,cev7xjh,4,t5_2xz02

This argument is no different than saying that the xbox netflix app shouldnt auto stream because people might loose their controllers after starting the app...The whole point is that if you arent there anymore you walked away fell asleep etc then netflix stops streaming. To get the video on the chromecast to being with you had to use some device i dont think its too much to ask anyone even the most brain dead of users to be able to press a single button on that device again to keep watching after a few hours of streaming. The real reason the CC only plays one at a time is that it uses a version of the android mobile Netflix app and that app has auto streaming disabled so that people dont unintentionally eat through their data plans something that isnt an issue with the CC.  ,Chromecast,cgjawid,2,t5_2xz02

718302,0,t1_cglg6xu,This is actually a completely valid question that should not be downvoted. The reason why certain supported services YouTube Netflix can go DIRECTLY to the chromecast and everything else must be decodedreencodedreboradcasted through the chrome addon has to do with the HARDWARE inside the chromecast.The Marvell chip inside the chromecast is not a powerful device. It is cheap and keeps the cost of the device down. It does however have DEDICATED silicon to DECODE p HD H. encoded video. This essentially means that the chromecast hardware can only do this one thing well play video. Not much else.What does this mean?For one thing There is no browser on the chromecast. This means it cannot load webpages to display on its own. WHY? Google most likely chose not to because the said Marvell SOCs CPU is not fast enough to adequately do this.Another missing link in the chain is Flash. This old deprecated technology is unfortunately still around and is being used mostly for DRM purposes in the online streaming world. The chromecast does not have Flash support again most likely due to the weak hardware and corporate licensing shenanigans with Adobe. Many web streams use flash that cannot be decoded by the chromecast hardware.YOUTUBE HBO GO and NETFLIX all send plain old H. video to the chromecast. The companies have to support it. Their servers support it. The video stream is not encapsulated in any thing fancy like Flash. This stream is exactly what the chromecast hardware can play The only solution to using the services that DONT support direct H. streaming is the chrome addon. Its a quick and dirty solution that puts all the hardware intensive work on the computer that is streaming instead of the weak chromecast. Computer loads the webpage as usual and then CONVERTS everything it sees into H. ONTHEFLY to send to the chromecast! This is not particularly easy. Downside of this means that the computer has to be fairly powerful to handle the decoding and reencoding.TLDRChromecast hardware is fussy. It needs content in a particular format.If content does not match format a computer must convert it.,Chromecast,cglxahi,2,t5_2xz02

810556,0,t3_23eb6l,Ive been asking myself the same question and tried some things out recently. So heres what works for me. All of these methods require a PC and also work outside of the USA. A Using Plex and the FilmOn Plugin. This plugin is part of the unsupported app store for Plex that you can download here With FilmOn  Plex you can stream a lot of live TV channels to the Chromecast. The video quality is not great only SD for free users but its watchable.Pros Free lots of channels. Convenient remote control with mobile device.Cons Low quality B Another option is USTVnow You can register and and access six live channels for free. Select one of the free channels on their website and start tab casting. Select high quality HD is laggy for me. Then maximize the player. Voila A live US station in decent quality on your TV.Theres also a Plex plugin for USTVnow but since its automatically switching to HD its laggy for me.Pros Free good qualityCons Requires a pc performing well enough to cast a high quality stream. C This one is actually my favorite OnlineTVrecorder Its not live tv but you can download recent news shows or anything else you want a couple of hours after they have been aired. You have to register and pay   monthly to access UK and US channels. No subscription no cancellation neccessary if you dont want to use it anymore. You have to also pay per download prices are very low though. For example you can download todays CBS This Morning for   and thats even one of the more expensive shows because its about two hours long. Its provided by a German company but you can choose to display the website in English. The videos quality is not so great but its definitely watchable.Pros You get legal access to A LOT of content movies shows etc. Elaborate website with lots of options and a very detailed search.Cons Video quality could be better but its still watchableHint If you dont want to wait untill the download is finished you can cast the temporary .crdownload file with the Videostream extension for Chrome and watch while its being downloaded. D Perspectives Theres this Android app called Mobdro thats a lean and clean application that searches the web for free streams of your favorite TV programs. It offers a great variety of channels and is stable and reliable. I use it to watch TV on my tablet sometimes. It has no Chromecast support yet but they announced that theyll add it soon. If its possible to cast all the stations they support thatll be quite cool.,Chromecast,cgwexn1,9,t5_2xz02
827898,0,t1_cgyd00e,Yeah I couldnt get it to work. The server on my desktop could see the server on the phone but not the other way around.Im going to experiment with ffmpegs builtin streaming. The problem is ffmpeg doesnt seem to support HTTP so I may need to proxy it through ffserver unless theres some hidden way to get the Chromecast to accept TCP or UDP links.I also need a barebones casting app example that just demonstrates how to pass a URL to the CC and tell it to play.,Chromecast,cgydtmh,1,t5_2xz02

844275,0,t1_ch05c2o,No purchase required actually. If you have a Mac or Windows PC download Chrome and then the Chrome Cast Extension. Then if you havent already navigate around Plex.com and install the Plex Media Server to your computer. Then if you havent already go ahead and create a Plex account and use this to log in to your media server. Then in Chrome go to Plex.tv in your browser. Once there click the sign in button at the top right of the screen. Then also at the top right should be a button that says servers. Click on this and then the server you created should show up. Click on the server name and then click the  launch button. Then after doing the whitelist action I mentioned earlier a chrome cast button should appear in the top right hand corner in your Plex library. Click this and then select your Chromecast and then as soon as you play any media from Plex it will be sent to your Chromecast.,Chromecast,ch08xdr,1,t5_2xz02

919463,0,t3_24k0ck,For you all having the issue where seeking in an MKV causes a black screen with audio only I found a fix from uSwissJAmes in an older chromecast thread. Duplicate your video file and rename it to .mp instead of mkv. Load the .MP file into VideoStream and voila now you can seek to any point in time in the video and it works! I imagine this doesnt work with every single mkv but its worked for all of mine so far.,Chromecast,ch8srk8,2,t5_2xz02
919953,0,t3_24k0ck,Edit  its not pausing videos again using either the browser pause button or the remote pause button. Cant pause a show to get a beverage have to force stop casting from the Chromcast button. Guess I spoke too soon. I added Videostream to Chrome  days ago when the press releases hit and I admit I was ready to write it off as everything I streamed was troublesome. I had some hefty .mp and .avi rips of DVDs mine if it matters between mb and . Gig. I was getting stuttering and delays the app and the remote werent tracking the actual time of the video and it was generally depressing as I was already getting these sorts of issues streaming the same large .mp files from a Chrome tab.I left it alone for a few days while I was busy then decided to give it a try today with some of the same movies. Flawless. No issues it pauses when I hit pause skips quickly when I skip through the video it tracks the time stamp and it loads large files quickly. Hats off Videostream guys. I dont know what you did in the last  hours but you really improved the performance. The tagline is correct this is what I bought the Chromecast for and it handles my local and NAS networked videos seamlessly. Ill go premium once discretionary funds roll around in the budget. Thanks again.,Chromecast,ch8urtv,2,t5_2xz02

Offer an optional cool gyro mouse with hardware keyboard and microphone or some other cool input device so you dont require a phonetablet to operate it.  This would drop the barrier for getting them as gifts for the technologically challenged.. Faster screen mirroring and direct device connections so you can take it to a friends place plug it into their TV connect your phone directly to it and stream media to it or even play games if its fast.  This will be tricky to do wirelessly.. Allow for an optional Ethernet connection.. Allow native decoding of more codecs and containers.  This would be nice for those of us whom use digital tuners that catch over the air TV in an mpeg transport stream ts format. Also allowing streaming of other file types without transcoding would be great.. Add a digital TV tuner perhaps as an addon accessory because why not..

The best solution is to see if your TV has an audio out port and connect that to your surround system. The second method is to see if your surround system has an HDMI inputoutput. If it does then plug the chromecast into the surround system then send the surround HDMI out to the TV.

2729494,0,t1_cndwok2,Have you tried checking the settings in this little square And when you play a youtube video on your computer this icon is not available  ?Since its a laptop I have a couple things you could try if possible.  First disable your local firewall completely via the control panel and if convenient take your laptopchromecast to a friends house or a different WiFi network.Try disabling all chrome extensions except the Google Cast extension too.  Press F in Google Chrome click on the resources tab click expand local storage and then click on the YouTube video you want to play.  You should see chromeextensionboadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd. I believe the way it technically works is when the webpage loads it tries to discover the boadgeojelhgndaghljhdicfkmllpafd extension or the Beta dliochdbjfkdbacpmhlcpmleaejidimm.  If it finds the extension it will display the cast icon.If your cast extension is able to discover your devices but the webpage is not able to discover the cast extension that would be very odd.  The cast extension discovery is done via JavaScript too...so maybe antivirus firewall or strange router settings.,Chromecast,cnebykf,2,t5_2xz02

3069163,0,t3_2vb1o3,Honestly I agree with  on the raspberry pi idea. Thats probably the easiest solution. I havent heard of connecting to multiple chromecasts with a single device. I would think that it would need to disconnect from one chromecast to cast to another which would mean that you would need to have multiple controlling devices one for each chromecast. Unless anyone else knows a way around this. Then you would have to write a script somehow to monitor for available chromecasts on the network and automatically cast to them. Which Im also not entirely sure is possible anyways. Another option would be an HDMI splitter which is gonna cost you more than getting a bunch of raspberry pis anyways and you would still need the script.,Chromecast,cog45s5,1,t5_2xz02

For security purposes its best not to allow people to connect to your router even if theyre blocked in the config. Its just plain fishy.Also how much do you pay to rent the modem?

If that doesnt work and the factory reset doesnt work you might need to just buy a new one luckily they arent as expensive as the apple tv.,Chromecast,cpn8jw6,0,t5_2xz02

I chose Nexus Player since its easier for my gf to pick up a remote and go into Netflix or Plex vs dealing with phone and then pushing it to Chromecast. So far no issues with NP. Picture is good. I used Micro USB to Ethernet adapter to ensure Internet signal is the best it can be. Also voice search is another reason I went with it over just Hromecast.

8793208,0,t3_50k45g,This has never been officially implemented nor is it a part of the Chromecast SDK  because  take Netflix for example the only possible way this can be achieved remember the Chromecast gets the content direct from Netflix not via the phone is for the Chromecast to get the stream from Netflix and then the phone ALSO gets the same stream from Netflix and even if it doesnt display the video it still needs to decode the stream to get to the audio. The Chromecast would then need to send sync messages across the websocket connection to the phone to keep the phone and Chromecast in sync. Its technically possible  but clearly a huge waste of bandwidth to have to stream  copies of the content even though you are only watching it in one place. The Roku gets around this by sending the decoded audio to the remote via Bluetooth which is perfectly suited for this. There has been suggestions that the Chromecast could send the decoded audio back to the device over the network  but the network connection is a Websocket and its not really designed to be anything other than a command and control connection.,Chromecast,d74tozm,3,t5_2xz02

I have a UI on my router to track data usage of devices. Also mine turn off when my TV turns off as I use my TVs USB port.

Also review the following recently published article that addresses your needs relative to streaming via airplay to Apple from an android device.

An optional access restriction feature thats off by default is not fundamentally opposed to the Chromecast. Its nowhere near as unrelated or unreasonable as asking a car to also be a boat. Similar casting products like the Apple Airplay have an optional pin or password feature. The Chromecast itself has a pin feature when in guest mode. It works seamlessly on those devices and doesnt compromise any other part of the design.If you want a car analogy it would be more like if a car model didnt have electric rear windows and you asked if it could.
