1807346,0,t3_2etr3y,The road planners in Tallahassee dislike people who use their roads and they hate people who are trying to go EastWest. Gaines Street went from a little used backwater except for gamedays into a main eastwest corridor after the Pensacola Street bridge in front of the stadium was demolished. Gaines was supposed to be improved to handle the cars but instead it became this showpiece road designed to bridge the colleges and state offices. It looks great and has revitalized the area but it doesnt work as a way to get across town. It is bizarre that Gaines goes from six lanes by the stadium to a two lane slow road. Now they want to take Tennessee from six lanes to four. If you have to go across town there are no good options.  ,Tallahassee,ck6yh38,1,t5_2r7a3

9408031,0,t3_59hgpu,League of Women Voters is fantastic for putting this together each election. I rely on it heavily. The only thing they dont really cover is the merit retention votes for judges. The goal of these ballot measures is to determine if a judge should be retained or not but its really hard for a citizen to determine that. To help The Florida Bar polls their members on what they think. Since members of the Bar interact with these judges regularly their opinions are valuable in helping the public determine which judges are doing a good job of remaining impartial. You can see their  poll hereFor what its worth the Bar members think we should keep them all. Also its worth noting that in the history of FLs merit retention vote system no judge has ever been voted out. Also keep in mind that if a judge does get voted out the current Governor gets to appoint their replacement. ,Tallahassee,d98j8dj,4,t5_2r7a3

10992438,0,t1_dedt5jq,I havent really seen a breakdown of his political agendas per se but Id expect more or less a more left center more Barry O than Bernie agenda from him.  Id expect something to the tune of criminal justice reform education reform health care reform etc. Ive lived here for the past decade but Ive seen quite a bit of city growth over the last several years. That may or may not be attributed to Gillum or the City Council or both.I think his harshest criticism was the hurricane preparedness and response which a lot of the criticism wasnt necessarily his fault. However as the face of city he needed to make sure there were as little miscommunication as possible. This is my own anecdotal experience so take it with a grain of salt. The Dems particularly love him and may be able to win the South FL voters.,Tallahassee,dedyi18,6,t5_2r7a3
11048628,0,t1_dekblj4,Nope. Fish. Editing because I looked into prices at a few places I like for comparison. Echelee nice sized tacos with pretty much anything you want on them  for  tacos. Very tasty good price but not high end or fancy.The Wilbury big fat tacos stuffed with inhouse brisket baked black beans and mac amp cheese  for  tacos. Not in any way authentic but super tasty. There are other options just picked the one I like best.El Cocinero many options for  each stuff like Marinated grilled pork grilled pineapple fresh onion cilantro and so on. High end make their tortillas in house etc. Plus there is decent seating.Taco Bout It chicken pork or mushroom topped with onions cilantro and a wedge of lime on a housemade tortilla are the  options. No cheese available.Look I like the people involved. I like what they are doing. But they are a taco stand. Bring the price down or up the size on them things. Because there are a lot of people selling tacos in town and so far theyre not really standing out for me. I mean I just scratched the surface with that list. ,Tallahassee,dekccz7,1,t5_2r7a3
