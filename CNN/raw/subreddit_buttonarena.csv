4324646,0,t1_csd3boh,Hes not talking about Dancing Knife specifically but abilities in general. Again this is probably me knowing my own work too well to  explain it thoroughly the first time but I described Dancing Knife as using a basic attack because thats essentially what it does. You make an attack roll and a damage roll and the description takes it from there. Youre not actually making a basic attack. Sorry.,buttonarena,csd479q,1,t5_3826g
