6461772,0,t3_43pmrx,My group has gotten quite used to th Age stuff now and I like to twist the icons around fairly frequently.I merged the Diabolist and High Druid into one figure that has been come to known as The Hermit. With Hellholes and demons given a feytwist. The only real interaction my players have had with the influences of this icon is in witnessing the parents of a town pulling lots to decide which child to send into the forest for a tithe to allow the protection of their village from the encroaching woods.The adventurers had gotten just to the outskirts of the forest and found hundreds of statues with golden masks  for some reason that was enough for them to decide that they didnt want to be anywhere near here and bailed to go find fortune somewhere else.,13thage,cznovh8,1,t5_2xyuo

7921687,0,t1_d46ebl4,Hmm. Not at the moment. Id need to neaten up the doc to make it worth reading. A lot is head canon right now. It is on my bucket list now though.,13thage,d46h0ru,1,t5_2xyuo
8287906,0,t3_4szf9o,To mirror other comments The best OUTs tend to start with The only  and altho its not a requirement I always try to get my players to use that statement. Maybe the only Cave Bear that can transform into a person? Bearwere instead of wolfwere? but there are quite a few other ideas  perhaps youre the only slave to escape from Manfreds Carnival of Horrors or the only slave to escape from the Demonic Pits of Yorth or something else that you totally make up and is awesome. Or maybe the master you killed to escape was somebody particularly important or noteworthy in the campaign like the human ambassador to Drakkenhall or the Lord Master of the Dire Wood.Remember your OUT is your way of forcing the GM to put something into the campaign world and is your chance to tweak change add to or play with the setting!They only other advice I can give If youre playing at a table use notecards or a cheat sheet with your spells and abilities typed or written out. It can help quite a bit. Dont forget to use your Scout Form whenever a battle looks like it might be a tough one and decide if you want to have a variety of scout forms or just one favorite same with your beast form although it looks like you already decided you like to shapeshift into a bear.Good luck and I hope your games are great!,13thage,d5djpkv,3,t5_2xyuo
9285114,0,t3_57k57m,Ive never managed to actually play a proper campaign of th age  our game fell apart spectacularly and we havent gone back to it yet we will but were playing Mutants and Masterminds In Space for a bit first. Beyond that my favourite edition of DampD is th because it knows its a game and is designed to be fun my least favourite is .x because... well a whole host of reasons really nd holds a special place in my heart because Planescape was my first introduction to DampD and Ive not played th yet. ,13thage,d8syeke,3,t5_2xyuo
9548170,0,t3_5bodtj,A lot of these I feel are flavor questions best left up to the player. If the player thinks that its cool for their armor to shift with them to suit their animal form then thats what it does. On the other hand if the player would rather have their armor represented by having a thick hide or bony plates then thats what they have. The important bit is your first question a druid wearing armor andor carrying a shield does get the AC bonus associated with those items while in shifted form. Everything else makes little difference to the mechanics of the game and as previously mentioned Id let the player decide the finer details of what their animal form looks like. ,13thage,d9q0bzx,7,t5_2xyuo
9890979,0,t1_dawt4tu,Good point that would work. You could build a bowwielding fighter and multiclass him with an wisdom cleric and have it work well.,13thage,dawtg21,1,t5_2xyuo

10564444,0,t3_5r7sp6,If I wasnt the only person I know who wants to actually GM th Age I would love to play this version of a necromancer.This is because I loved playing the Necromancer in Diablo II and made a Dread Necromancer in DampD . with the same concept in mind. I loved the character and have many happy memories of playing him but the system of making undead in DampD is extremely complicated. First you need to kill the right kind of creature then you need to have the right amount of Onyx with you then you need to cast a spell to create undead. Now this only takes a standard action for your character but it takes an awful lot longer for you to sit and apply the skeleton or zombie template to whatever creature you just stumbled across.The th Age Necromancer gives you the same kind of feeling without any of the fuss. Feelingwise undead are undead. They are their own distinct entity rather than say demons bound into corpses like in Dragon Age though if you want to bind demons into corpses to create your zombies that could be a cool One Unique Thing. Furthermore your minions are completely obedient just like in Diablo II and arent going to turn on you for no reason. And as always th Age allows you to add overthetop embellishments with a minimum of fuss. Do you want to ride around on a big skeleton Chimaera? Just grab the Skeletal Minion Talent. Are you worried that the authorities wont like you walking around with a big undead monster? Just get yourself a positive relationship with a Lawful Evil badass like the Crusader and a background like CrusaderSanctioned Necromancer and youre good to go.In short Necromancy usually falls into the awesome but impractical category. th Age made it practical without losing the awesomeness.,13thage,dd5lkzp,6,t5_2xyuo
10664422,0,t3_5sl19x,I always loved the far off desert continent trope which is more sword and sorcery in flavor than the campaign continent setting. Usually that means my barbarians come from that land. Or a far north land filled with undead or giants or whatnot. Its also usually where my dragonborn tieflings and other monstrous or unique races hail from.I just like ASOIAF I guess.,13thage,ddfyciz,3,t5_2xyuo
10803629,0,t1_ddtl29f,Sorry but no.The wood elf racial is miles fucking miles above any other racial power. Weve had a wood elf in out party from levels  by now and while the player screwed up his build and kept changing things around the one thing that always kept his PC above everyone was the ability to just pump out one more spell sometimes several times per combat.No other race has anything remotely similar.,13thage,ddubgsc,-1,t5_2xyuo
