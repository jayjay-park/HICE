3626015,0,t3_31m08a,I got a fairly solid Othala Shaker with the Red Joker and the Second trigger is a Jera Brute with the  of hearts so a decrease in versatility for more power and control... Hmm Looking at it this character has poverty as one of his negative aspects for both... and a connected shakerbrute power possibly something like a person who sustains themselves off the land around them but renders it barren and those caught within it are enervated until they leave.poverty and homelessness are both on Othala he can speed this process to give himself enhanced regeneration and strength ,FutharkGenerator,cq5lcwi,2,t5_37edn

4109656,0,t1_croi10f,It was just from a  minute conversation. Essentially the people from WeaverDice got a hold of this and tried to use it for their thing and it didnt go into the level of detail their current system does so it got some kind of bad wrap? Apparently some people were also using it to make some super broken characters because we sort of trust people to be realistic with what they get,FutharkGenerator,croq57y,1,t5_37edn
