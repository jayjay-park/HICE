4885,0,t3_1u5rzy,The point of the Prime Directive is to prevent harmful imperialist actions similar to those performed by conquistadors in Mexico colonists in North America and crusaders in the Middle East. Interference however well intentioned has the capability of leading to oppression disease and the destruction of culture.Your science officer claims that should these Polynesianlike natives continue to settle on islands that they may irrevocably damage the ecosystem. Okay. Maybe maybe not. We dont really know whether that will happen or not and we dont know what effects will come about due to the Polynesians actions. They may form an island society that would be prevented through our interference or they may destroy the islands and themselves with them. We cant be sure.What we can be sure of though is that interfering with these people using futuristic technology or introducing these people to ideas before they are mature enough to comprehend them will be destructive. More importantly this is these peoples planet. What ride have we to swoop down and declare what is and is not appropriate in their care of it potentially damaging these people in the process?Now if the planet was about to blow up thats one thing. Clearly destruction of the planet is worse than any alternative and it would be wise to intervene and let life thrive on this planet.

153066,0,t1_cevkssw,Im not convinced that transwarp is the way to go for anything other than spacelanes.The way Borg transwarp works is by generating a transwarp conduit basically an artificial wormhole once your in youre coming out where ever it ends whether you want to or not.  When jumping into possibly hostile territory thats bad whats worse is that transwarp travel also affects the power levels of Federation ships.  Imagine being the admiral who suggested transwarp after your vanguard armada drops out in the middle of a bunch of Swarm ships without the power to generate stable shields or fire phasers.Slipstream on the other hand has various additional benefits to its use as an explorer ships drive other than the ability to change course while moving.

178019,0,t3_1w4l9t,I think CBSParamount is going to be VERY cautious about making a new series whenever they decide to actually do it. So maybe instead of a live action show that is going to be very expensive theyd be better off doing an animated series not that animation is super cheap either. And not like the s one though I do love it. The postBatman TAS world of animated television has proven to be a place that can not only handle complex stories but also long story arcs and character development. Just look at recent stuff like Avatar The Last Airbender Star Wars The Clone Wars or Young Justice. A Trek cartoon would fit right in. As for the premise behind the show there was already an idea for a postVoyager animated web series so maybe something similar to that but I think its more likely to be set in the Alternate Universe and would follow the adventures of a ship other than the Enterprise. Maybe it could deal a lot with the Klingon conflict. But I think theyd want to set it around the same time as Into Darkness. ,DaystromInstitute,ceypltq,6,t5_2whek

They could also be betazed or Dinaali or Drayan or Krenim or any of a host of other aliens that are only distinguished from humans by odd markings if at all.Personally my theory on the Origin of the Queens was as a defensive reaction to the individuality brought into the collective by Hugh. Unable to eradicate those elements that were running rampant through the collective it instead tried to isolate them by concentrating it down into a single entity possibly with the intention of them purging that entity. But instead the Queen took control. Possibly separate sections of the Collective each tried this and we ended up with multiple factions each with their own Queen. I explain Picards flashback in First Contact as being more metaphorical than literal his brain had never been able to really comprehend the concept of the collective as a voice in his head so when he saw the Queen it latched onto it and transformed that incomprehensible collective into a literal voice whispering in his ear.,DaystromInstitute,cf8szh7,4,t5_2whek

608540,0,t3_213rte,Subspace most likely comes out of one of the consequences of String Theory  that there are many more than  dimensions either  or  depending on the type of string. As of now physicists really have no idea what these dimensions could look like. To bring this back to Trek not only did the writers needed a FTL method of communication they needed one that was faster than ships could travel otherwise all the federation ships would do would deliver mail. Warp drive works by actively distorting space. To do so you need an engine so anything that does this effectively might as well be turned into a ship. In normal space the fastest something can propagate is the speed of light. So the Trek writers needed a medium in which some sort of wave can propagate faster than both the speed of light and faster than starships can travel. So my best guess is that they took the idea of extra dimensions and designated one as communications medium.That being said Im honestly surprised that Trek didnt use the idea of entanglement to have instantaneous communication. Physicists still arent sure if entanglement can actually be used to send valuable and useful information faster than the speed of light but something as basic as something being physically impossible shouldnt stop Trek.

Its helpful to the audience and since stardates have always been inconsistent and confusing it takes nothing away.If we cant accept this minor change we can explain it away with the alreadyexisting theory that Spock and Nero come from a different timeline that just strongly resembles the one we know.gtDoes Earth have such a stranglehold over the Federation that the other member worlds just allow terracentric timekeeping?Everything else in Star Trek has been shown to be ludicrously Earthcentric from the Federation standard language to the mostlyhuman crews to the designation Sector . Why is this suddenly a problem?gt Its cumbersome. If I ask an officer whats the date today he will say . Are time travelers so prevalent that you need to recite the entire year? The person asking likely knows what year it is. Why not just say its .? If someone asks me the date I dont say it is the third of April two thousand and fourteen.

Once he is forcedchose to experience the darker impulses of Suder he lost his cool. A fully mature and in control Vulcan became terrifying mix of adolescent rage and power. Did a lifetime of consistent practice really mean nothing or was he simply unprepared to deal with emotions that he already possessed due to a lack of selfawareness and experience leading him to become drunk on these feelings until shocked back to his senses by the Doctor?Theres a bit about this I havent seen addressed yet in anyone elses fantastic responses.Tuvok had a known as in awareness of its existence degenerative neurological disease. He could not be treated on Voyager and until Janeway changes the timeline at the end of the series he had been continuing to decline  so far as that seeing him so dependent erratic and emotionally distressed contributed to Janeways desire to change the past and get him treated in time.I dont feel like a natural nontriggered disease is a fair data point for this discussion.

916421,0,t1_ch8dq7s,Id have to agree.If we are going to call it a TRUE democracy we have to first determine what version of Democracy you are referring to as Democracy has been modified with additions made over the centuries of its use.Even in the series of modern democracies that exist around the world there is less power held by the people with oligarchies becoming more predominant.In terms of the Federation I imagine more of a modified version of how the UN was designed with obvious additions. If we were to compare it to the modern world Id say that the UFP is a combination of the UN with its own military beholden to no single planet the WTO and the WHO. Heres my reasoning.The current UN model has member states that send representatives to vote on legislation and laws that govern the Federation overall. The establishment of Starfleet which answers only to the Fed Council is much like the UN forces however without specific loyalties to the individual states. I could also see the original founders of the Federation Earth Vulcan Andoria etc. holding security council positions as we have now in the UN. The General assembly of member states votes for the president and he works together with the security council on issues that affect the federation.I add the WTO and WHO simply because they are responsible for trade and health. Having these two current agencies in the UFP as a single entitiy makes sense and to me also explains the economic advantages to joining the UFP. After all youre looking at receiving aid from a massive economy so that yours develops and has the potential of reaching the standards of living and comfort of member worlds.As I understand it as a member of the UFP there are specific rules and laws that you must follow but just as in the UN the laws of your specific planet are yours to legislate as long as they follow the code and laws set forth by the UFP. This would also govern how they choose their representatives to the general assembly and in the case of founding planets the council.Would you consider this a true democracy in the greek sense? Id say definitely no as it lacks the direct participation of citizens.

1190284,0,t1_ci3dnyc,Your examples of interactions with Q are interesting and the points made are plausible.

The interactions between Q and Quinn if your hypothesis that mental trickery and illusions are all more likely than the selfproclaimed abilities of the Q it must take into account the two conflicting Q and their hideandgoseek game. They gain no advantage in a fake display of their powers to the Voyager crew with regards to teleportation time travel and compressionexpansion of a  metric ton vessel. This includes Qs ability to locate Voyager with a small lag time. Qs comment of I know all the hiding places dont indicate mental trickery or illusions. Quinns interactions with the continuum A being with the power to traverse the galaxy conclusive as the same Q is present in both Alpha and Delta quadrants should be quite capable of suicide by simply ducking into a black hole. Although it could be said that he could be teleported away from those by an observer watching at all times. But that would raise the question of why Quinn didnt do so immediately after his release from the asteroid but before the Q continuum noticed. The Q civil war during The Q and the Grey Voyagers Q actively participate in the civil war with Q weapons.

1193744,0,t3_27s35g,Its an interesting article but I think it misses the point in a few key aspects.  The authors main point is that bridge crew take longer to carry out the captains orders than an automated system would be.  But speed isnt everything when it comes down to running a starship usually its more about making good decisions and being robust enough to keep functioning when put to the test.  So what are the advantages of a physical bridge crew?Bridge crew make thousands of little decisions independent of the Captain better than the computer could.  The captain gets to sit in the big chair and make large scale decisions but its up to the individual crew members the chose exactly how they are carried out.  When the captain shouts evasive maneuvers its the skill of the helm officer that decides how evasive those maneuvers actually are.  Just look at the DS episode where Sisko is pulled into the mirror universe and ends up commanding the mirror Defiant in an attack against a NeghVar warship.  His mirror universe crew are inexperienced pilots forcing him to spell out directions more explicitly and even take the helm temporarily.  Now weve also seen in other trek episodes that the computer can take control and execute evasive maneuvers as well but there is a strong preference to have a skilled pilot at the helm instead which suggests the pilot does a better job than the computer.  This undoubtedly extends to the other bridge officers as well.  The captain might say Target the ships weapons array but its up to the securityweapons officer to decide exactly where to focus fire undoubtedly taking into account the hostility of the threat where else the phaser might hit on the ship and the damage it would cause etc.  Engineering is constantly shifting power to bolster the systems that need it most and bypassing broken systems.  The list just goes on and on.  In all of these cases weve seen that the computer can perform many of these roles but never have we seen that the computer can perform these roles better other than faster.Bridge crew are more reliable than computer controls.  You can imagine that for a peaceful voyage of exploration most bridge crew routines are so basic that the computer could probably take control.  But what about in battle or near unknown anomaly?  The computer is large and sophisticated but the highlevel controls voice operation amp AI fail quite often in these tense scenarios.  While the crew can also fail crew members can be replaced more quickly than the computer can be restored.  Certainly for the EnterpriseD there always seemed to be an abundance of crew manning the secondary stations in the rear of the bridge.  If Mr. Crushers console happened to explode at OPS during a battle you would expect one of those other crew to either take control of OPs from their station or move Wesleys corpse aside to take his station.  One crew member might have died but the bridge as a whole would still continue to function as normal.  This makes a personcontrolled bridge far more robust than a fully computer controlled system because there are more independent parts that keep it operating.  Even if the Captain were to be killed or incapacitated the First Officer or highest ranking officer present would be there to immediately take charge and continue the mission.The final advantage of a live bridge crew is the one that the author here picks up on as a foil to the will of the Captain.  The Captain might be dead set on breaking the neutral zone to attack a Romulan starbase on the other side but it would only happen if the bridge crew also consented.  While not  foolproof its much better than not having any checks on the Captain at all.,DaystromInstitute,ci3wy4m,6,t5_2whek
1196809,0,t1_ci46g1v,Yeah thats fair enough.I would have thought theres less matter stored than antimatter because once the reaction starts the antimatter will react with any normal matter no point storing more matter than necessary the casing and physical components of the torpedo can react with the antimatter for the final reactions. The small feed of antimatter could still work however itd have to be pretty slow and would release a fair amount of high energy radiation usually gamma  although there would be no explosion the torpedoes would be hazardous while defusing themselves.,DaystromInstitute,ci49cii,1,t5_2whek

1310242,0,t3_29314x,I disagree. I think Khans plan was to take over the Vengenace and use it to continue his centuries old quest to dominate humanity. All through Admiral Marcus attempt to use him Khan was doing the same this is why he designed the Vengeance so that one man could if necessary control it. This is why he hid is people in the experimental torpedoes in the first place not in an attempt to flee and start a new life but rather so they could be awakened at the crucial moment and together with Khan they could take over the ship. Naturally he assumed his new torpedoes would be loaded onto the new warship he had designed  the perfect warship the ultimate expression of Khans aggression and will to dominateThe discovery of his plot did throw it into disarray and he was forced to improvise. And certainly his affection for his crew his family is real but then we saw that in Space Seed and TWOK as well. The only new thing is that its expressed more keenly likely due as you said to his impression that hed lost them.But the things he says to Kirk whilst in captivity you are an honourable man etc are all carefully calculated to win Kirk over and to blind him to Khans true intentions. He tells him just enough of the truth  Marcus plan  to make himself seem trustworthy while keeping the details of his own scheme to himself.He saves Kirk during the EVA not for sentimental reasons but because at that point hes still useful as Kirk himself says to Scotty on Vengeance I think were helping him.And remember that this gt Khan could have actually done as he threatened to do with impunity and rendered the Enterprise a lifeless husk but at that point he chose not tois not in fact the case. After he sends Kirk Scotty and Carol back to the Enterprise he does open fire on it presumably in an attempt to destroy it. The torpedoes exploding prevents that just barely  of course at that point enough damage had been done to send Enterprise spinning to her death toward Earth.At that point Khans warship his magnum opus had been crippled as well he believed that his crew was dead and that his grand plans had been foiled.

1331440,0,t1_cij18w0,Section  is shadowy and does distasteful things willing to do anything to preserve the Federation. They have access to advanced technology but they are not the magical ubersinister intelligence agency that can solve any problem. I can think of four scenarios.. Section  was not ready to act against the Blue Gill threat and was biding its time. . Section  was not capable of acting against the Blue Gill threat.These two options could imply that  Starfleet Command had been emptied out of all noninfected personnel and only Picard was allowed in to be infected thus making direct action impossible against the infected without a firefight. It could also imply that Section  was not aware that killing the Brood Mother would be the simple solution.Another interesting though for option  is that any operation to effectively excise the Blue Gill threat may have involved revealing the existence of the Section  organization. If enough of Starfleet Command had been infected it might be difficult if not impossible to cover up your tracks as an agency that has remained under the cloak of secrecy for over  years a remarkable feat in and of itself.. Section  was coopted by the Blue Gill threatEntirely possible and would explain Section s inaction against this existential threat to the Federation.. Section  did act and Picards intervention was their workI am NOT suggesting Captain Picard is a member or asset of Section  in this scenario. I am suggesting that his behavior and actions were manipulated by Section . Captain Walker Keel was not a member of Section  either but he was contacted by Section  and given incontrovertible proof that the Blue Gills were a real and imminent threat to Starfleet. And of course as we know from the official record and logs Keel was able to recruit Picard to investigate Section  had the Horatio destroyed to both erase the link to their organization as well as to spur Picard into action over his dead friend. The Blue Gills were aware of Keels suspicions and were of course also delighted at the destruction of the Horatio. Unfortunately for them these events were not at all under the control of the Blue Gills as they had supposed. This option is perhaps the most coldhearted and yet also true to form for the Section  we theorize to exist.,DaystromInstitute,cijejs4,2,t5_2whek

1488951,0,t1_cj2vz9l,gtThe time to start building a fleet is not when the enemy is knocking at your door.You make a good point.I might suggest to the other admirals and yourself that the levels of deployment seen during the Dominion War just arent sustainable. They take too many men and resources away from the other things in the Federation. Keeping all these ships in fighting condition and so on is perhaps too much energy going into the other things in the Federation. Its a drain.That said I think one of the things weve seen from the Borg incident and the Dominion War is the weaknesses in the Starfleet model of exploration ships conscripted into wartime duty. Id be wanting our committees that I mentioned to be looking at how to speed up that process in case we have to mobilise again in the near future. Thats why I mentioned laying ships up in ordinary. We dont need them immediately but we can get some of our Zakdorn friends to file them all nearly ideally keeping a better eye on them than they did on the Tripoli in a storage yard ready to be reactivated. I wouldnt want the wholesale destruction of ships for no good reason other than that theyre there.Of course if its a choice between disassembling a battered Akiraclass vessel that we dont have the men to operate and using its warp core and replicators to keep thousands of colonists on a ravaged world alive or having the ship just for the sake of having it Id know which I would suggest to you and the other Admirals.And then on the other hand the citizens of the Federation are weary after a long painful war. So many families have lost people and so many have sacrificed so much. They arent going to be all that keen on hearing that they so many valuable resources are going into maintaining a militaryindustrial complex maintaining an expensive warfleet without a clear enemy.Lets remember that by its very nature the Federation will never be as secure as the Klingon Empire where they have the public appetite to use so many resources for military vessels. We admirals have spend a long time moving ships around battle maps closing every gap making sure nothing sneaks through. Weve become suspicious careful and worried.

1551542,0,t1_cjac387,I watched this episode for the first time recently so maybe need to check it again but I assumed she didnt bond with him. I thought that was the whole point of the episode.The episode examines Picards character through the lens of a personality intrinsically inclined to give a person whatever they want in a partner. His moral certitude and commitment to selfcontrol sees him desire her liberty more than anything else. Ultimately she gives him that at least as a fantasy just as she is fully capable of fulfilling any other romantic fantasy. By telling him she had bonded with him she gives him the fantasy of her now being a discrete bounded individual. One that has to judge her life and marriage as not necessarily being one she is intrinsically designed to accept but one full of comprise. Just like any other autonomous individual.Her bonding with Picard is no more real than her suddenly baring teeth at Worf or slinging it with miners it just took more time for her to adapt to due to the exceptionally high psychological barriers Picard puts between himself and his selfish desires.I mean doesnt this just sound like Picards ideal woman?  A beautiful intelligent stoic maiden condemned to a life of selfreflection on the nature of individuality and circumstance due to obligations outside of her control? And that is out there in the universe waiting to be rescued by the perfect morals of Picard but that Picard never actually has to go and do anything about  thus risking psychological intimacy and behaving selfishly  because it would be inappropriate?She was biologically incapable of doing anything other than pleasing men around her. There is no reason to think she magically stopped this due to the brilliance of Picards morals in their time together. If anything this episode is a meditation on how Picards morals  usually so valuable in almost any other situation  have the power to create his own hell when applied to his romantic life. He is at heart a lonely man and she became a woman to appeal to that fantasy.The dark truth that Picard couldnt face about her nature as a metamorph is that the moment he left the room she would probably stop trying to please him and focus on the next physically nearest man in space. He wanted this to be different and she game him the fantasy that would satisfy this desire. Not every thing in the universe conforms to Picards ideals.

1664634,0,t1_cjoyv75,My main point is that no matter how advanced the Federation is the resources it commands as a society are limited and how those resources are distributed is subject to the laws of economics. Individuals and organizations can not have everything they want instantly.   There are for instance immense costs in time and resources that would be associated with collecting and processing material from the asteroid belt. Sure its there but it isnt instantly at the command of the Federation. Just as unexploited mineral deposits exist today on Earth. The Federation mining industry would have a limited capacity. Also Certain substances are very rare even on a galactic scale. Hence the importance of certain planets with key resources to the Federation economy that are shown throughout Star Trek. The material used by replicators would therefore have a limited supply and a value based on supply and demand. Also the goods produced by replicators would by extension have a finite supply and a value based on that of their inputs. These goods would have to be distributed in one of only two possible ways. The Federation would have to ration them or they would have some form of monetary value. Think about this for a second. Why didnt Star Fleet build those billions of ships? Why doesnt every citizen in the Federation have the option of owning his or her own starship? Why didnt McCoy go replicate a ship to go to Genesis or have one built for free? Their means are limited. The means of every society are limited. The laws of economics as we know them still apply which is consistent with the examples of economic activity and motivation in Star Trek that I cited previously.    ,DaystromInstitute,cjozlyh,1,t5_2whek

For instance the Ambassador class is specifically referred to having been designed for those deep space missions whereas we know ships like the Steamrunner Akira and Defiant classes have a distinctly different mission.  So perhaps it has to do with what kinds of things the ship can provide e.g. combat and science and diplomacy and cargo and on and on vs specialized ships for only one of those particular roles and the requirements of being away from a starbase for prolonged periods of time.Edit and in regards to the NX its simply an outgrowth of the basic design of the Phoenix.,DaystromInstitute,cjrnbtb,4,t5_2whek

Starfleet wouldnt know the Reliant was rogue just yet and another ship would have to be sent to Regula space to find out what happened to the Enterprise.Khan possesses the Genesis torpedo and a Federation starship. He has some limited time until Starfleet figures out what happened to Enterprise Marcus and her crew on Regula I amp the Reliant crew.Khan could do one of several things strike out for Klingon space. He could    a try and broker a deal with the Klingons using Genesis as leverage. The Klingons would be incentivized by possessing superior weaponry.    b Khan shoots Genesis at the Klingon homeworld making it appear to be an act of provocation by the Federation. War erupts between the Klingons and the Feds and Khan and his followers now have a diversion to slip away into unknown space and grow his people. While his ship is still believed to be crewed by a Federation one Khan heads to Earth with plans to launch Genesis at Earth.Personally I like the idea of Khan going dark and hiding from the Federation. If he managed to stay hidden with Genesis for  months the events of Star Trek IV happen and the alien Probe decimates Earth. Without Kirk and crew to stop it Earth is removed from any sort of position of power. This would give more probability for Khan to remain unimportant while the rest of the Federation assists Earth in the aftermath of the Probe.By the time the events of Star Trek VI happen and Kronos is decimated by the Praxis explosion now two of the major superpowers in the AlphaBeta quadrant are on the ropes.This is when Khan makes his move.,DaystromInstitute,ck3i65m,3,t5_2whek

This note would come from Starfleets paperpushers processing the logs of legitimate actions taken and would have served to warn the crew of the Reliant.That there wasnt any mention of such a warning or a computer flag to the effect of this system has fewer planets than last time suggests Kirks crew failed to do their jobs.  Adam Savage wrote The difference between screwing around and science is writing it down.  If Kirks ship didnt report their science results of the Ceti Alpha system and note what they did at best they were screwing around.

So... theres one. Edit OP has made it clear he is referring specifically to colonies based on artificial satellites not just any old colony so this doesnt really apply.Your arguments in the rest of this thread seem to revolve around the idea that because weve never seen Federation colonies on screen they dont exist. I cant recall ever seeing a shot of the moon in the run of the show that includes a view of the colony colonies?. Doesnt mean Riker was wrong it just means space is big.Consider Star Trek TV shows have only followed three ships around the original Enterprise the EnterpriseD and Voyager. The first two had the explicit stated mission of going where no one had gone before... not hanging around established Federation systems and colonies. Voyager got kicked halfway across the galaxy  definitely not going to run into Federation colonies out there.Star Trek simply suffers from a great deal of selection bias when it comes to showing civilian colonies on screen.

2000311,0,t1_cku5lhr,I think that this stems from the preexisting femme fatale sort of idea. A femme fatale is a woman who uses her sexuality as a weapon to trick tempt or otherwise corrupt the male protagonist traditionally speaking. So we already have this female villain archetype of the seductress presentif you try to turn that up to  as things tend to go in the Mirror Universe it just removes gender from the equation entirely. That sexuality is now a weapon that can be used against male and female alike.So I dont think its intended to be dismissive of bisexuality no more than the femme fatale is of female sexuality in general anyway. Any connection between bisexuality and evil characters is usually more a result of said character using their sexuality as a tool and most villains are likely to use just about any trait they have as a tool to get what they want. A villain like the one in Warlord would likely also use Kess female identity as a way of disarmingsurprising opponents by exploiting traditional gender roles or for a more typical scifi example her telepathic abilities. Villains use what they can to win almost by definition.Of course this whole thing gets a lot more problematic in a show that otherwise completely lacks bisexuals. That if anything is where the negative associations emerge from. Small sample size.,DaystromInstitute,cku8jex,4,t5_2whek

I could go off on a rant about just one of the many questions this apparent contradiction raises but Ill keep it short.Is humanitythe Federation responsible for these drastic changes in the Borg? I hesitate to provide an answer to my own question because it is all speculative and formed upon many assumptions but I think the question itself is important. As the Borg grow in the shows and film they become less machinelike. It doesnt seem like too great a leap to say that the Borg perception of perfection grew away from a drive for technological development to blending their strengths with the strengths of these pesky AlphaBeta Quadrant species.,DaystromInstitute,ckvp421,7,t5_2whek

If that CO is offship on a mission etc then command of the ship passes down but there is always one named individual in command of a ship. One cannot be in command of two ships at once.However...once can be in command of a group of ships. A good example is the Carrier Strike Group which is a formation of an aircraft carrier at least one cruiser a destroyer squadron and a carrier air wing and usually a submarine or two and maybe some other vessels. In this case youve got a CO of each vessel plus the commander of the group itself who is usually on the carrier so youve got two COs on the carrier one for the vessel itself and one for the Strike Group...oh and one for the air wing who also reports to the Strike Group commander...,DaystromInstitute,ckwve3b,5,t5_2whek

2026307,0,t1_ckxci6u,I think youre only viewing education from the very narrow perspective of education in your particular corner in the Western world. To you education is just going through the motions so that you can get a job and get money.But an education is a lot more than that. Education empowers people to do things they simply could not do before because they simply didnt know how.An uneducated community cant deal with severe sickness or injury because they lack any medical knowledge. An uneducated community cant repair the technology that keeps people alive like foodproducing replicators because they lack any engineering knowledge. An uneducated community doesnt know how to predict or even handle a colossal hurricane or earthquake because they lack any meteorological or geological education. Even issues of philosophy and diplomacy are vital for a community to have a basic understanding of. Id particularly think that the Federation would value those things as these are directly related to living a fulfilling life and ensuring that a large amount of people are able to interact ethically and peacefully with a full understanding of how even in grey esoteric situations they can take actions to help others and essentially do good.Youre acting as if education has only produced jobs and cash but thats clearly untrue. A massive part if not the massive part of how society has greatly improved worldwide is directly because of better educations for everyone across the board. If you take away peoples right to an education you strip them of knowledge that can save lives and greatly improve the quality of life for everyone involved.If youre trying to argue that the state educational system here in presentday America is flawed and in need to reevaluation I am  right there behind you. But if youre trying to argue that humanity would be better off without standards for education or would be better off with no formal education then youre just simply wrong.Theres just this titanic mountain of evidence that education improves quality of life not just in jobgetting and moneymaking but in the much more important fields of workdoing and decisionmaking.It is morally wrong to allow a government to fail its people in such a monumental way as total governmental collapse and the literal dissolution of civilization. How is it not a horrific tragedy that in a time where man can bring people back from death that someone could die from contracting the flu or live malnourished in a time where replicators exist or be helpless against natural disasters and alien invasions in a time where weve long since mastered ways to provide securities?The government is designed to take care of all of its people. Thats literally the most important role that system plays. The rules of a postscarcity society can only really apply to a society that has access to postscarcity technology and ways in which to use it. These people didnt have that. Hence being a huntergatherer society. The government without regulation failed them heinously. Took them from a postscarcity utopia to a total nongovernment.

2085020,0,t1_cl3zjfw,Sorry youre getting downvotes for asking questions. Asking questions should be encouraged both on this subreddit and in any discussion of legal theory. I would expect better in this subreddit of all places...French law a good representative example of natural rightsbased IP law handles reviewscritiques and parodies in the same way as US law there are explicit exemptions for those and a few other types of use in the statutes defining copyright infringement. Outside of those exceptions the authors right to prevent any unapproved modifications to a work used to be pretty much absolute  to the point where architects were able to block renovations to a building based on their right to preserve the integrity of the original design. AFAIK that right has been narrowed in recent decades so it mostly just applies to visual and written works e.g. you cant alter a painting or make editorial changes to a written work and then publish it without getting the creators approval for your changes.The Federation is a moneyless society so clearly whatever legal system they have isnt really focused on financial damages. The main remedy for copyright infringement is probably just injunctive relief the courts will make sure they cut out the infringing activity. In some cases some additional compensation might be ordered perhaps requiring the offender to issue a public apology or something like that... And maybe Federation courts would have established rules for dealing with international disputes involving parties from currencybased economies who seek monetary damages from Federation citizens. At any rate you are hurting the author or at least you are violating their legal rights and they are asking the court to enforce them by refusing to honor their natural right to protect the integrity of their work and control when and how it is shared with the public. They dont need to prove why they have good reason to care or how the infringing activity harms them materially any more than you need to prove that a trespasser on your property is a particularly lousy house guest before you have the right to insist that they leave. Now you cant sue them for a million dollars without convincing a jury that their trespassing somehow cost you a million dollars  but you can have the police assist you in forcing them out if they refuse to leave and you can have the courts order them to cut it out or face jail time. Damages are important to most plaintiffs today because most people want the court to order the defendant to fork over lots of cash but if you just want to force someone to stop blatant ongoing violations of a clearly established right theres no real need to worry about quantifying the harm being caused From a contemporary US free speech point of view publishing a ripoff whether its a misattributed copy of someone elses work verbatim or a copy of someone elses work with unapproved alterations or whatever may be a form of self expression but I think an advocate of natural rights theory would say its not true self expression because the thing you are expressing is not something that you created yourself. To put that another way speech acts communicating an original creative work made by the speaker are a special sort of expression that is more worthy of protection than other forms of speech. Even in the US free speech rights generally end where someone elses legally cognizable rights begin which is why you can be convicted of a crime if you lie under oath to a court or say that you plan to kill the President and you can be sued by a private party if you make slanderous or libelous statements about them defraud them out of money or property or breach a binding contractual NDA in the course of impassioned political speech. Those are all cases where either some individual or society at large has a greater legal right in prohibiting you from saying something than you have in saying it. We tend to think of free speech as this absolute inviolable rule but in practice its really more like a strong presumption against banning speech that can nevertheless be overcome by a suitable compelling state interest. If you want to juxtapose Django Unchained clips with your own words then you may have the right to do that or you may be violating Tarantinos rights  it would depend on how much of his work you used and whether the court thinks it was justified in context. If you just want to show the whole movie and then give a speech that you view as thematically related... Thats probably not gonna fly. You have a right to communicate whatever ideas of your own you wanted to express but not to show Tarantinos creative work without permission because you think it supports those ideas nicely. If Tarantino agrees he can always authorize you to otherwise his right not to have his work shown in public against his will and potentially associated with views he finds objectionable outweighs your right to speak in the form of a public showing of a movie you played no part in creating. ,DaystromInstitute,cl4uo92,1,t5_2whek

I might as well dismiss your supposition about unmanned warp ships as baloney.It was not a supposition it was an idea that made sense based on the beta canon.If anything chucking things and events in alternate timelines when they can make sense in just one timeline be it Star Trek Enterprise or the Bonaventure is baloney.Its a somewhat logical approach but is a dumb and gratuitous way to get rid of things you dont like. Case in point the only real objections youve drawn up are its not canonically humanbuilt reasonable but still boils down to its just not canon particularly given that it can fit in one timeline along with the Phoenix or this alternate timeline business.gtgtI wouldnt demand that specificity because I know it doesnt exist. I actually did the research on the script before making the bold claim that there is no evidence to the contrary of my proposition.I said this because I looked at and read the whole First Contact script and found no dialogue supporting the common assumption that the Phoenix was credited as being the first test of warp drive which it was not.I didnt mean to simply declare I was right I was pointing out that First Contact doesnt mean what people think. There just isnt quotable evidence from the movie that says the Phoenix was the first warp ship and that includes the quote you provided. All that says is that ZC invented warp drive.gtBut I doubt youre going to entertain the notion that the Bonaventure was never actually built are you?Of course not. Something that was never built cant have discovered anything. The Bonaventure discovered warp drive. Thus it existed as a real ship.gtBonaventurefirst PhoenixfirstI spent some time thinking about it and I think I get your idea here.Lets assume for a moment that youre right that First Contact made a split timeline and see if it works.. The Bonaventure is launched sometime after April th  and is therefore credited with discovering space warp in the first timeline DS. Bonaventurefirst.. Later the Enterprise crew goes back in time with the Borg helps the Phoenix launch creating a new chain of incidents where the Phoenix discovered warp drive first and then they returned to this timeline.Unfortunately this doesnt make sense given the Enterprise crews statements about their situation.If they changed the timeline into the Phoenix being the first warp ship then they couldnt have known they would change it into a warp ship.Consider they knew historically that the Phoenix had launched in . Therefore the timeline where they came from recorded the Phoenix as a warp ship.If their timeline ALREADY recorded the Phoenix as being a warp ship then theres no way they could have altered it into a warp ship.Conclusion whether or not there are alternate timelines at work here the Phoenix couldnt have changed from not being a warp ship to being a warp ship because when the Enterprise crew went back in time the Phoenix was ALREADY equipped with a warp engine and the like.Therefore since the Enterprise crew of a timeline in which the Bonaventure was credited with the discovery of space warp expected a warp ship to exist on April the th  the discovery of warp drive from their historical perspective must have happened before that date. In other words the discovery of warp drive happened before the date  they arrived at.And as I make clear above the only way to alter a timeline such that a particular event is eliminated is to travel to before that event which did not happen.You can think it created an alternate timeline if you want but it certainly did not alter the fact that the Bonaventure came first.,DaystromInstitute,cldumw6,1,t5_2whek

Any individual component should be fine however. This would be akin to scrapping a machine gun because the cart youre carrying it around in ran over your foot. There are great reasons in the Star Trek universe not to trust most of the AI they stumble across but you dont throw away the tool too.gt The second reason is that they dont understand the new technology. Any new thing that a civilization capable of fasterthanlight travel teleportation and molecular replication discovers would push the boundaries of physics. Which is kind of the point. If a Federation gearhead had come up with the idea hed get his own lab maybe on Regula I if it was thought sufficiently dangerous and told to go at it. But because an alien civilization came up with the idea it goes down the memory hole and doesnt even come up during the Dominion war when it would be fantastically useful against Jemhadar warriors with phasershedding body armor or suspected changelings so that they can be tested in a controlled environment and exonerated.gt Does the stasis field involve literally isolating its subject in time? Then what happens when you release the field? Do all of the quantum interactions at its boundary that would have happened in that time happen at once? If so wouldnt that lead to a huge explosion or the creation of potentially dangerous exotic particles? And isnt that essentially time travel? There are a lot of potential problems mucking about with quantum mechanics and even if you can perfectly reconstruct a stasis field it does you no good if you dont understand what will happen. You could cause an explosion a black hole a rend in the fabric of spacetime. Even if none of these things happens in RampD it does the Federation no good to develop a nonlethal weapon if for all they know turning it on may annihilate everything for lightyears around.All valid concerns in general but again in the specific case of the Minosian stasis field questions with known answers or which have proven safe enough for study in isolated lab conditions. In orderDoesnt seem to. Momentary disorentation and not much else. Doesnt seem to. Definitely didnt. Not really but if it were it would be forwardsonly and therefore not causally dangerous.Your point is taken that simply disassembling the weapon and ducttaping it to a phaser is a terrible plan but Starfleet is supposed to be made of science fetishists and the weapon has proved if not safe than safe enough to study. Given that a month and a half later we find out that Paul Manheim has been monkeying around with ripping holes in time gets his entire lab crew ripped apart at a causal level and doesnt even get a reprimand before being sent back to his research I find it difficult to buy institutional safety precautions as the reason we never see this again.,DaystromInstitute,clztst0,3,t5_2whek

2355948,0,t3_2mc023,Some stories especially longrunning legacy stories like Star Trek where fans beget fans beget fans do really well with reinventing the past and intricately weave their way through canon to imaginatively squeak by an amazing It was there all along! revelation that puts everything that came before it in an unexpected and redefining light. It creates clever aha! moments that only a fan could create.Few stories benefit from these however. In most cases this doesnt retroactively add layers so much as overlap. Theres a fine line between reimagination and stagnation and making a great big galaxy into a small world can make the entire show including its history feel well confining.Personally I dont like the idea of the Borg Prophets and PahWraiths all sharing the same origins. Especially when those origins are the cliche It was us all along! type.Its the sort of thinking that seems cool on paper or more specifically on a fanforum or fanfiction site. Honestly it doesnt really look good in any other setting but thats where the honeymoon begins and ends.I mean lets set aside the canonical issues which are a bit plenty with this particular theory and really are too exhaustive to pick nits over and focus on the vastly more important issue Does it make for a good story? Does it add to the Trekverse in a meaningful way leaving it even richer than it was before? Is it a good idea?And honestly I dont think it does. While your theory is certainly imaginative I cant honestly call it creative. A lot of this is just revisitation and recontextualization. And the context is a bit... well small.An obsession with origins is unhealthy and detrimental to good storytelling. Attempting to unify everything under one grand explanation only makes all of the events that follow seem smaller.I mean literally all of modern Vulcan and Romulan culture is now caused by some petty spat between Federation factions over who gets joined in the Singularity or not. Something as monumental as the redefinition of a race gets thrown into the context of military one upmanship. Surely you can see how this lessens the story?Worse the conflict seems to be contorted to the tourist events of Trek history rather than acting as a natural cause to them. Why the Eugenics War? Why the PahWraiths doing? It doesnt make sense other than to get an established name to cause an established event.A lot of fanfiction does this because hell its fun. But that doesnt mean it makes sense or is a good story. Its easy to get your Boba Fetts to your Tatooines but when you overuse the character and the location and constantly need to tie everything exclusively to them you just wear out the appeal of both.Humans being everything feels both hilariously anthropocentric and frustratingly closeminded. In the great expanse of the final frontier itd be terribly disappointing to discover all of the cool shit is just us from the future recycled over. It drains away all the intrigue and mystery to give explanations for every little thing especially when you force the same explanation across every conceivable event and party. Simply put In trying to have fun it ends up lessening the fun. ,DaystromInstitute,cm2wmv6,15,t5_2whek

It turned me off so badly that I stopped watching for a long time and only went back after finishing all of DS and loving it.

He even threatens violence against her in the first  minutes You have no idea how much Im restraining myself from knocking you on your ass. Then of course the awkward dinner with the captain where Archer is again hostile accusing TPol of being a spy and we get Trips obnoxious line to TPol I took a shower this morning. How about you Captain?Then they take a full  minutes to practice forced sexualization of the  most attractive characters in the show as we watch them slowly slather blue goo all over their glistening bodies.I like Enterprise over all and I really enjoyed the rd and th seasons but this episode was so bad I questioned the series.

2920888,0,t3_2tll62,Reference Sections Canon Fire  The Agency  The FTS  FATsNote  Suggestions for better namesacronyms are welcome!Canon FireMy notion of how credits work is at the heart of my theory of how the Federations economy could work.  My notion of credits is formulated to discourage hoarding and concentration by keeping credits in the virtual hands of individuals closer in my view to actual physical resources and valueadded labor.  I tried to make my Federation Transaction System FTS autonomous flexible and unapologetically biased in favor of functional value over financial value to enable it to act as a robust constraint on highlevel greed chicanery and corruption.  Unfortunately I dont see any way for the FTS to be effective without it being supported by a gargantuan heavily shielded bureaucracyThis presents a problem because nothing like this is ever mentioned or even suggested in canon even though this system would have to be a huge part of the environment of The Federation and could be viewed as being in competition with Starfleet for political dominance.  This is the main reason I think my Federation economy is canontolerant and not canonfriendly.I do think I should be able to wriggle through the cracks because we mostly see things in Trek via Starfleet. Starfleet personnel would be isolated from this system perhaps aggressively so.  And even though I view it as unlikely in most cases members of Starfleet might not even be Federation Economy Participants FEPs themselves.Another canontolerant wriggle is to assume that most interactions with the FTS would be indirect automated and so routine especially in the late rd and th centuries as to be virtually invisible to most even to FEPs who arent in Starfleet.I could go on but hopefully you get the idea.A Semiautonomous Government Agency Makes It SoIn my theoretical Federation economy the Federation Transaction System FTS evaluates Transactions proposed by Federation Economy Participants FEPs and if those Transactions are accepted executes them as Federation Approved Transactions FATs.  The FTS and through it FATs are the most important components of the engine which powers The Federations economy.A semiautonomous Federation government agency referred to as The Agency is responsible for creating maintaining and operating the FTS.The Agency operates under an Establishment Charter that specifies its structure governance rules and procedures.Among other things The Agencys Charter specifies the composition of its Governing Board the members of which are political appointees who serve fixed terms and cant be fired only impeached.  The procedure by which an Agency Governor can be impeached and removed from office is a matter of law and not part of The Agencys Charter.  It is chiefly through this arrangement that oversight of The Agency by the Federation government is possible.The Agency is analogous to current day central banks. It is a government created entity that is not directly subject to political control.  In addition while its Governors and employees are themselves subject to Federation civil and criminal law their activities related to the internal functioning of The Agency are not.  They cannot for example be compelled to testify in legislative hearings or civil or criminal court regarding the performance of their duties on behalf of The Agency.Inside The AgencyThe Agency is necessarily gigantic.  It is responsible for funding constructing maintaining managing and securing its own administration communications and information processing infrastructure.The Agencys Governing Council Includes a Cybernetic ConstructThe Agencys Charter requires that the Governing Council must include an artificially intelligent but nonsentient cybernetic construct referred to as the Simulated Aggregate Participant SAP.  This construct represents and acts in the name of all FEPs.  It is created and maintained by The Federation government outside The Agency.  Because of who it represents the SAPs votes carry disproportionate weight in council deliberations and decisions.The Federation Transaction SystemThe task of the Federation Transaction System FTS is to examine and evaluate Transactions proposed by Federation Economy Participants FEPs to determine if the proposed Transactions are acceptable and if so to appropriately post Federation Account FACC balances thereby performing Federation Approved Transactions FATs.The criteria that the FTS uses to evaluate proposed Transactions are determined internally and immutably by The Agency that governs it so these criteria must in theory be viewed by the world outside The Agency as arbitrary.Whether or not a proposed Transaction is accepted and a FAT performed is completely and arbitrarily at the discretion of the FTS.  All decisions by the FTS are final.  No mechanism exists for official review or appeal.  If a proposed Transaction is rejected the proposing participants can put together another and try again but they have no recourse but to accept the FTSs decision on the original Transaction as final.  No judicial legislative or governing body other than The Agency has jurisdiction.In theory therefore the FEPs are solely responsible for putting together and proposing Transactions that the FTS will approve.  This is an apparently difficult and discouraging requirement.In practice FTS criteria are made available to the public in great detail and are for the most part intuitive except in complex situations such as collective endeavors irony noted like consortia syndicates and corporations.  Also FEPs can count on the FTS providing decision logs and ledgers that can be used to determine why a proposed Transaction was rejected or for that matter accepted.  For some applications however like the aforementioned collective endeavors considerable perhaps even cybernetic expertise could be required to fully understand the criteria or to correctly interpret decision logs and ledgers and use them to preevaluate or postevaluate a proposed Transaction.Therefore in practice the FTS can be counted on by FEPs to accept reasonable Transactions to justify its rejections and to routinely accept all but a minuscule minority of proposed Transactions.The FTS Favors the Exchange of Things of ValueIn theory because the acceptance or rejection of a proposed Transaction by the FTS is arbitrary anything that the FTS could conceivably accept can be put forth as the object to be exchanged in a proposed Transaction.  In practice the FTS is highly biased toward exchanges of things of value that is physical goods or useful services for an appropriate number of credits.An example of an unreasonable Transaction one that would almost certainly be rejected by the FTS would be an attempt to sell a grain of sand for a million credits an obvious attempt to get around the restriction that credits cant be transferred.Federation Approved TransactionsIn my proposed economic system the only way the Federation Account FACC balance of a Federation Economy Participant FEP can be changed is through the execution of a Federation Approved Transaction FAT.  When the Federation Transaction System FTS accepts a Transaction proposed by two or more FEPs at least one seller and at least one purchaser the FTS performs a FAT.  In a FAT the FACC balance of each seller is credited with the amounts agreed upon in the proposed Transaction.  In accepted Transactions this always occurs regardless of the FACC balances of the participants.  The FACC balances of the purchasers might or might not be debited at the discretion of the FTS but never by more than the agreed upon amounts.In effect the sellers in a FAT agree to have their FACC balances credited with an amount exactly equal to the amounts agreed upon in the Transaction.  In turn the purchasers agree to have their FACC balances debited decreased by no more than the amounts agreed upon in the Transaction.  The FAT process does not require that the purchasers FACC balances equal or exceed the amount agreed upon in the Transaction. When the FTS accepts a proposed Transaction for FAT processing the FTS also determines what if any amounts will be debited from the FACC balances of the purchasers.  The FTS could and often does decide not to debit the FACC balances of a purchaser at all especially when the Transaction involves Quality Of Life goods and services such as food shelter medical treatment etc.The asymmetry of FATs is a crucial tool of the FTS allowing it to support FEPs who would otherwise suffer deprivation or harm while at the same time supporting and encouraging FEPs who are providing vital products.  This asymmetry can also be used as a way of increasing the number of credits available in the economy.More Reference Sections in More Comments,DaystromInstitute,co04423,2,t5_2whek

2941915,0,t1_co2hjjg, I actually did skip the last sentence when I got all excited about pointing out the progenitors after reading the less divergence bit.  but regardless the progenitors provide all the linkage you need to explain the xindi. There is no reason to assume some difference in splitting on the trees of life compared to other planets.  You have a situation where some seed DNA is supposed to guide evolution but within the context of the natural evolution.  So if you compare humans and vulcans you will have a tiny bit of overlap in the progenitor DNA but the rest will be all different especially the areas around the progenitor DNA.  This would mean that a sequence analysis like phlox was doing would find some similarities but it could easily be explained as isolated convergent evolution for specific proteins.  Science prior to the progenitors probably over emphasized the importance of convergent evolution for some genes important for intelligence because of this overlap.  In the case of the xindi we are talking about races that are evolved within the same genetic soup.  So naturally the genes couldnt be explained away as simple convergent evolution because they would integrated into the similar secondary gene organizations.  Like HOX genes or something.  This would make them appear more related using any sequence analysis based approach despite the fact that physically they could have diverged many years prior.  In other words a algorithm like that which I am sure phlox would use would always produce a higher degree of similarity from two organisms from the same planet that had both incorporated foreign DNA regardless of the actual history of evolution on the planet.  There is no need to assume anything beyond this.  Try to remember that you have about  similarity in your gene coding regions as some plants.  Two organisms from the same planet would have a lot of genetic overlap and if there is a progenitor sequence that is somehow controlling the evolution of the organism you could imagine a LOT of similarity.  ,DaystromInstitute,co2ibu8,1,t5_2whek

2962631,0,t3_2u2xbt,gt tldr Star Trek is fictional.Star Trek taken as a whole is a set of narratives set within a continuous fictional setting. Analysis of those narratives is to treat them as works of fiction and is a worthy pursuit. Analysis of the continuous fictional setting in which those narratives are set necessitates an entirely different approach but is no less worthy.To quote the sidebargt We discuss both canon and noncanon topics at the Daystrom Institute and encourage discussion from both inuniverse and real world perspectives.The entire message of your post appears to be Yes but all that inuniverse discussion is pishposh because its fictional. Perhaps thats not your intended message but that is how it reads to me and judging by other commentsreplies how it comes across to many others as well. Why does warp . work out to c in one case but over c in another case in the same episode ENT Broken Bow?  Real world answer because the former comes from the ostensible science behind the warp drive while the latter is a plot contrivance necessary for the episode. Inuniverse answer because the performance of warp drive is heavily dependent on environmental factors that greatly alter the effective travel speed of a ship regardless of the warp capability of its engines.The former is the end of a discussion and does not produce anything interesting to me at least. The latter however opens doors to many discussions and possibilities and especially ways of further defining the framework of the narratives  the aforementioned continuous fictional setting.An anecdote Im quite fond of comes from the production of s Superman. Richard Donner the films director had the world verisimilitude posted prominently in the production offices. It was a message to everyone working on the film Yes so far as we know there is no alien world called Krypton that sent a being here that gains impossible superpowers because of the radiation of our sun. That is clearly fictional. But for the purposes of this film we are going to treat that as real. We are going to make you believe that a man can fly. This is the heart of the inuniverse discussion angle. If we take as assumed that what we see of Star Trek depicts real events in a real world  not our world but a real one with consistent rules the way our world has consistent rules  then what conclusions can we draw from that? If the settings rules are inconsistent to the point where they cannot be reconciled this often leads to the restoration of disbelief to contrast with the suspension thereof and so it is I think imperative that every author of every narrative strive to ensure the existence of this verisimilitude.To dismiss this kind of inquiry and exploration or to  if youll forgive my choice of wording  pollute it by factoring in authorial intent and so on strikes me as simplistic arrogant counterproductive and ultimately does a disservice to the stories being told.I like analyzing Trek as a work of fiction. I also like analyzing the setting of Trek. These pursuits do not generally overlap for me.

I watched the films in the  aspect ratio as part of classwork in the early s.  However at that time it was impossible to view  as the original production intended.  Kubrick must have been fuming about MGMs decision to release his film as a  film.  A few years later while at a prominent University I was encouraged by the CinemaTV professor to review  as it was originally intended in the original . aspect ratio projected on a huge movie screen with correct sound amplification.  The differences were so appalling that I ended up writing a term paper for cinema class on this particular issue of aspect ratio scale and sizedensity of visual information.To this day Im a film snob when it comes to aspect ratios.

3254549,0,t1_coys3mk,Theres a big difference between an exploration cruiser and a short range frigate.The venerable Miranda class hull is ideal for these short range duties. The Miranda class hulls are modular. The mission pod mounted atop the ship can be easily switched out for different mission pods. These ships can also be run on tiny crews or theres enough interior space that it can be reconfigured for survey missions.But mostly these ships function as a defensive garrison. Theyre tasked to planets and starbases with missions to patrol the region around their assigned planet or starbase.Weird subspace anomaly shows up? Send a Miranda. Freighter breaks down needs rescue? Send a Miranda. Nausican pirates causing mischief? Send a Miranda.While a Miranda can be used for a long duration science mission the small size of this ship means that its a single purpose ship. It can do a long range science mission if modified for that but what if it runs into trouble? Its not well equipped for that.As an example USS Reliant was configured for a long range science mission. It had a very small crew for its size and it had extra sensors on the ship as well as extra supplies to allow it to operate at range. However the ship was poorly equipped to handle combat. A Constitution class heavy cruiser would normally be able to easily destroy a Miranda class. Or rather it would have had its shields been up. Oops!A big long range jackofalltrades ship is invaluable for long range missions. Who knows what the ship will encounter? It needs to have a very big toolbox because of all of the unknown situations it will encounter. This is why the long range exploration ships are typically very large such as the Galaxy class.Short range ships dont need to be big because they stick close to their assigned port.,DaystromInstitute,cozcepx,12,t5_2whek

3263883,0,t3_2xfh5o,I favor a Doylist explanation for stuff like explosions visibly rocking the ship and sending people flying out of their seats into the aisles lighting flickering consoles exploding etc. its good TV. o In a real starship everyone would be restrained in shockabsorbing couches during a hostile situation and any failure of the inertial dampeners would transform the crew into pat unless they restricted maneuvers to only a few Gs. Similarly the lights and the consoles really shouldnt be receiving high voltage or current. Even in the engineering section I think you would see the effects of damage to the hull far more seriously decompression before youd see battle damage to electrical components. I would even suggest that the human crew would not have control of the ship they wouldnt have the reaction time an AI would be making picosecondbypicosecond evasion and retaliation decisions.In fact with energy shielding and inertial dampening in reality the crew might not even perceive that an attack was occurring until a hull breach blew them into space or a critical system took damage. For that reason getting to my Watsonian explanation you could argue that a little excitement like vibration lights flickering or even electrical shock at the consoles is feedback created by the ships systems to make sure the human crew knows that shit is getting real. o,DaystromInstitute,cp0ba94,2,t5_2whek

One imagines Scotty is tense when they fail. Capn I cannae push the Demons any harder! Theyre gonna go on strike!Ive always figured that replicators were just a whole class of manufacturing technologies that worked by making sparkles with resolution material volume speed efficiency et al. varying as with any other huge class of manufacturing technology like machining casting printing etc and that they came in pocket models and factory models and some could use only a few chemicals and some could use everything from lunchmeat to tritanium and so forth. Like they still mine things and farm things and starships arent made by shoveling dirt into a box with the ship driving out the other side and they still store antimatter and the like.So could they have a big giant scarce tightly controlled box that occasionally turned an atom of x and an atom of y into an atom of xy as part of making selfsealing stem bolt? Sure if youve ever had a nuclear medicine scan or treatment youve been a beneficiary of our limited capacity to do the same and if theyre sitting on handy sources of fusion neutrons and antimatter and the like I imagine you can make a nice big nucelosynthetic tree to get you from A to arbitary B if you really had to. But each step is not cheap and most such events produce radioisotopes that have to decay into what you really want and is notably still juggling with baryons not a big giant quarkgluon plasma or photon gas. Mostly Im just amused that at the notion that the process of in the closed environment of a starship turning your morning crap into your evening meal was imagined to involve energy fluxes sufficient to vaporize islands and regimes of temperature and pressure not seen since the Big Bang when the chemistry can in principle be done at room temperature and pressure. ,DaystromInstitute,cp5lskr,4,t5_2whek

The species has always been the subject of my pity truthfully to a greater degree than the Bajorans.They should have been restrained therefore but not exterminated.  I would have advocated the return of the DMZ to Federation control and perhaps the annexing of a couple of their other worlds if they were not yet ready to repent but beyond that I would not have recommended brutalising them.  A person who is violent and does not know of justice can only be taught about the concept by example.The focus then would be on removing Cardassias ability to commit further harm while remembering the need which motivated them to cause such harm in the first place.  One provision of a treaty between the Federation and Cardassia in my mind should be the requirement for Cardassia to atone for its crimes against the Bajoran people in a manner that will satisfy them but another provision would include replicator technology for the Cardassians with the appropriate patterns to supply their basic needs without causing potential security risks and sufficient dylithium to power said replicators.Hunger is one of the primary motives for violence and it has ever been thus in Earths history as well as Cardassias own.

Just because you have technology that enables people to work from inside their rooms never leaving them doesnt mean its the healthiest or the best for a crew. Its basically like the holodecks. Whats the point of building ships when you have the technology to just send probes to distant stars and experience everything wirelessly through a holodeck?I concur that as technology and efficiency improves ships will need less space for warp reactors or other ship systems. But this will open up the opportunity to use those spaces for many other technologies that would certainly be useful on starships but not considered until that time due to impracticality. For example industrial replicators adapted for ship environments that can immediately replicate huge chunks of the ship that was just blown off during a battle or much more complicated and vast sensor systems that previously could only exist on planets or orbital stations. Social interaction is crucial. Anything that inhibits that takes away from the combined potential of a crew. ,DaystromInstitute,cpi299g,1,t5_2whek

Berman was called a bean counter by fans before the Voyager thing kicked off and I think that title fits pretty accurately he is a businessman and probably a pretty good one but when you listen to and read interviews of the cast you get the impression that he had a very narrow view creatively. He would stick to a idea even when it was clearly hurting the show.  DS suffered because it was probably a bit ahead of its time. TV was still not at the place where long arcs were a good idea so it did make DS a bit difficult for nonregular viewers. Still I do think it could have done better had Paramount put its marketing weight behind it a bit more. It was never pushed as hard as TNG was initially pushed.   There have been some rumors that Berman was never really crazy about DS Perhaps it was because it had a team that was so entrenched that he could not really fit himself into it creatively. This is also why I think DS was able to creatively flourish while Voyager suffered. Berman had all his attention on Voyager because he was in a better position to influence it to his liking.  It is for all of the above that I consider Enterprise a great tragedy. We saw what it could have been with the last two seasons. If Enterprise had been run by Coto from the beginning I think that show would have been much more popular simply because it would have been different enough from Voyager to excite people again.   There is a three hour interview with Berman on youtube and he gets pretty indepth but it is easy to see all the things he is not saying. You can see that he simply was not great at recognizing talent and letting it develop on its own. He had to control all aspects of it and in the process he stifled it. This was seen with the Voyager cast and even in the first two seasons on Enterprise.  To put it simply Berman blames franchise fatigue because he did not really see that his results were not very good. Had they been good I think we would not be having this discussion and we would be watching a new series.  ,DaystromInstitute,cpzrbwg,8,t5_2whek
3578823,0,t1_cq06com,I dont know. there are a lot of awful TNG episodes in the first two seasons TOS is awful very often and DS had a rough start and total loser episodes throughout the run  in my opinion. Voyager is just the one that gets bullied a lot.Plus I think Voyager never gets credit for stuff they do handle well. like the Transition from third to fourth season I just recently watched. I liked Scorpion I and II a lot then it was followed by The Gift which hints at a relationship between Tom and Belana amongst other things  and most importantly  at a future in which Voyager had to endure a Year of hell during a conflict with the Krenim. Year of Hell I and II a couple of episodes later show us that.

3578900,0,t1_cq07pp6,Every Trek has its share of bad episodes. I dont know if I personally agree that the first two seasons of TNG were really as objectively bad as people make them out to be but I can say that much of the seventh season was poorly handled and contained many badly received episodes. Ironically this is where Jeri Taylor seemed to have the most power with the show. You can see a lot of the seventh TNG season in Voyager as a whole.  As far as Voyager getting bullied. I can see how it might seem that way and it may be harder for folks who really did latch on to it but to put it frankly its difficult to watch Voyager and not notice the weak characters the somewhat lazy writing and the pandering that became a signature BermanBraga staple.  Its okay to like the series I even like some episodes a lot but at the same time I cant ignore that out of all the Trek series Voyager never really found that special element that would have made it really compelling. It was designed to be as safe and unchallenging as possible to the audience and it was made worse because of it.  Everyone has their favorite series some may even call Voyager their favorite and they are not wrong to do so. That being said I do think that one could make a very strong case that Voyager was a objectively of lower quality when it came to writing.,DaystromInstitute,cq0812f,3,t5_2whek

Unfortunately a generic impluse to discuss something rarely is productive. Whats much better is something specific. For example you could ask for opinions about a specific aspect of their portrayal or things like that preferrably also with a short summary for those unfamiliar with the project and your own opinion on the matter.

Not me.gtGRANGER How can you possibly be harmed?gtRIKER Its not a question of harm. A single William Riker is unique maybe even special. Hundreds or thousands of them diminish me in a way I cant explain.Thats why its kind of surprising that hes so chill in Second Chances. Tom Riker is not simply a genetic clone but a copy that has an equal claim to being the real Will Riker.gtI think this may be the case. We know that by the th Century modern medicine knows exactly how the human brain works. Maybe. But knowing technically how the brain works doesnt necessarily mean that they have a firm or consistent idea of how personal identity works.Off the top of my head there are a couple significant stories that provide evidence for the What is Personal Identity in the th Century discussion Theres the Vulcan concept of the Katra which is a soul or memories or something. Its kind of unclear. I mean evidently Spock continued to be Spock after he did the little mindmeld thing with McCoy at the end of Star Trek II and everyone seems to treat Spock . the same as Spock .. This might be evidence for the In the th Century most people believe a sufficient copy to be identical to the original person response but we dont know that for sure. Maybe Spocks body at the end of TWOK was a kind of simulacrum or zombie  simply going through Spocks intentions before he was transferred to McCoys mind I think this kind of lessens the drama of the movie but whatever. There are the events of Power Play in which a group of alien criminals are discovered to be living on a planet as ghosts of some sort. One says that they were separated from their bodies which raises interesting questions on how this was achieved do they have physical souls or are these some kind of artificial energybased body?. That society at least must have believed that the resulting ghosts were the same as the original criminals or else they probably wouldnt have done it. Its not entirely clear how Graves does his little trick in The Schizoid Man but he evidently manages to download his memories and personality into Data. Did he simply make a copy? Was there a kind of continuous transfer? We dont know. We do know that everyone seems to think its really Graves in there and not simply a simulation or something. Last theres the fact that the Voyagers crew never simply copies the Doctor beyond the backup. Surely it would have been useful especially once the Doctor got the emitter to copy the Doctor a few times so that they could have a doctor onboard while also having one on an away mission or sending him onto the Prometheus. I think the fact that the crew never does this is evidence that they think doing so would be an assault on the Doctors identity as a person creating a copy being something of a diminishment but it could also be that they think it would necessarily be a new person that theyre creating and thats why they dont do it. Note that at least some people in the Federation have done this however in Author Author we see dozens of Doctors mining dilithium or whatever in what must be a very inefficient process. That the ones doing this explicitly do NOT believe the Doctor to be a person is further evidence I think.So all I can say is that its not really clear what people in the th Century or rd believe when it comes to personal identity and copies of a person. Evidence would seem to indicate that they think that a copy of a person would be the same person at least for a little while but thats unclear too.gtWeve seen people maintain consciousness during transport Barclays experiences during TNGRealm of Fear seem to indicate people do maintain consciousness during transport and are even capable of performing actions midtransport his grabbing the crew caught in the matter stream.Yeah Realm of Fear is probably our best look at how exactly the transporter works its also one of my favorite TNG episodes. Personally I tend to think that the transporter just pushes your molecules into subspace or something as you say subspace magic and then pulls them out at the other end. That would fit I think with whats depicted in the episode as well as the movies like TWOK in which people can talk during transport which doesnt seem to include being physically disintegrated and then reassembled someplace else. I mean how can Barclay get touched on the hand if he doesnt have a hand to touch? How can he see something in the transport if he doesnt at that moment have eyes?,DaystromInstitute,cqrwr8m,0,t5_2whek

Only in  of occasions e.g. the Bird of Prey in Trek VI do they make any reference to a torpedo tracking the ship and it does appear to sort of track although the BOP isnt actually moving at least not evading since its cloaked and they assume safety at the time.Given that Torpedoes are propelled weapons I can understand that they have a limit to their turning radius etc. given how fast they go and the efficiency of putting a full compliment of thrusters on a disposable torpedo... that said in Genesis they are testing torpedoes and one goes off course. The remote kaboom system fails and they have to chase it via shuttle how the hell a shuttle is supposed to catch up to a torpedo given how fast they appear to travel is beyond me but anyway. In this case Worf had to be ordered to blow up the torpedo and press buttons to do it  so in a complex space battle does the tactical officer get charged with ensuring he hits the selfdestruct on any torpedo that misses its target? Or in real battle dose the computer handle that? I agree though its never explained why a torpedo that misses doesnt come back around for a second pass.

4027350,0,t3_36mdkj,A Star Trek movie is not going to break a billion dollars at the box office let alone a billion and a half dollars at the box office any time soon. Paramount isnt realistically expecting those kinds of returns on a brand that lacks both the global multimedia recognition of Marvel or the broad globally translateable appeal of the Fast and Furious movies. Hell even if you do have those brands working for you a billion dollars is still a steep hill to climb.And you couldnt really make a Star Treklite movie that does that well either. Science fiction makes great money at the international box office but its the broadest least scienceheavy type of sci fi possible Avatar and Transformers dominate the top of the box office for the genre not brainier stuff like Interstellar or the Planet of the Apes reboots which both fell far short of a billion dollars.So whats an actual viable way to make Star Trek a profitable return on investment at the box office? Spend ninety million instead of a hundred and fifty million. Scale things back financially. Scale back your expected results. See if a good Star Trek actionadventure is capable of grossing half a billion dollars before setting your sights for triple that. Tell a story that relies less heavily on crashing space ships into planets. You wont lose your audience by doing this because this is in fact what your audience wants. A shrunken budget still lets you make the swashbuckling romp Paramount thinks Star Trek needs to be itll just have to have a few more fights in corridors and jefferies tubes than free falling onto laser derricks.  This wont be the strategy pursued by Paramount of course. Producers live or die by their ability to secure everincreasing budgets. Theyll keep struggling to fit Star Trek into an impossible crowd pleasing niche overlooking the profitable audience that embraced the  film and grudgingly paid for Into Darkness and is plenty big enough on its own to support some kind of regular Star Trek franchise in theaters.,DaystromInstitute,crfcj4c,6,t5_2whek

4073513,0,t3_377p4e,I know there are a lot of anecdotes and out of context quotes and metaphors about Westerns and Wagon Train To The Stars and The Rifleman. But is it really? If you were to ask someone what the themes of a Western were without ever mentioning DS theyd say things like Conquest of a frontier Nature as an antagonist Subordination of naturelocals Codes of honor and citizen justice mobssheriffs vs courtsjurisprudence Centering on seminomadic heroic rebels vs blackandwhite villainsAre any of these in DS except for in a really stretched way? DS is more like Seaquest DSV in space. I dont think Ive seen a single western movie centering around a small group of enlightened officials looking after the affairs of a semiremote wild west town cooperating peacefully with politically complex natives and regularly interacting with mysterious godlike beings. I mean look at this its a Western. Its about grizzled larger than life pioneers shooting guns at each other for simple reasons. Guy calls guy a coward blam. Guy wants to take guys girl blam. Girl doesnt like way shes being treated blam. Guys on a wanted poster blam. Guy was imprisoned for minor crime made to serve a tortuous soul warping lifetime in a tiny prison is released to find it was a simulation and he must now reintegrate into his life not blam. The last one was a DS storyline that snuck into the list sorry.Maybe early TOS can be wagon train to the stars kind of but not really. Maybe in its original pitch it was appropriate.

4111768,0,t3_37pv19,We have seen instances of militarystyle court martials inquiries and investigations in Starfleet so it stands to reason that  since there are no civilianfocused episodes involving legal issues  there must be a few civilian legal professionals on Earth if not scattered across the Federation. I mean youd have to have a few of them to draw up basic contracts for services such as transportation of goods either within or outside Federation borders. There would doubtless also be public lawyers involved in contract tenders between civilian organizations and Starfleet for the purposes of gaining access to or development research in a variety of fields. I mean the Atlantis Project Picard was so tempted by would have had to obtain consent from the Earth Government as well as regional authorities i.e. the former nation states whose coastlines would be used as jumpingoff points for scientists and adjunct service workers. And I refuse to believe that despite the utopian ideal humanity has no need for criminal lawyers there can be no doubt that the occasional theft or murder occurs  or an allegation for same  requiring the services of both the th century equivalent of prosecutors and defense attorneys. They would hopefully be few and far between but nevertheless required in a society where crime is all but eradicated.In short just because we dont see any doesnt mean there arent any. The majority of ST series focus almost exclusively on Starfleet i.e. the military and the few episodes in which we get a glimpse of civilian life never involve legal issues such that a lawyer character would be written in or cast. From a writers perspective it also makes sense to downplay the need for lawyers  and the adversarial system in general  in order to emphasize the point that Earth has become a utopia.,DaystromInstitute,croytou,3,t5_2whek
4120335,0,t1_crpo3m6,I just took the most popular ideas from two different threads about characters people would want. Im certainly not insisting on its current form just a rough draft to update a living document.A human counselor and a human security officer would be thrown in and a few more humans in lowranking roles but I thought it made the most sense that Starfleet was growing more diverse over time. Nog was the first Ferengi and SevenofNine introduced the Borg. The logical trend would be that more species would begin to join Starfleet eventually and there is a large gap in Star Trek history between then and now. Starfleet diversity increased from TOS to TNGDSVOY and another almost  year gap has formed. And the rate of diversity would increase at a faster rate. Thats just sort of how civil rights seem to work historically. The Dominion War would have earned the Federation quite a few brownie points in the galaxy but the many casualties would dissuade humans who made up the majority of Starfleet and the deaths at the time. Of course tons of humans would be willing to join but species new to the Federation whose cultures are not as versed in the hardships of the Federation and would only see its triumphs would start to get involved more further diluting the humans.Deep Space s massive appeal was that it was so diverse and all these characters had conflicting personalities. The thing with majorly human casts is that in the Star Trek universe humans are as perfect as you can get. Roddenberrys ridiculously high standards made TNG quite difficult to write. Humans cant generate much conflict. Deep Space  was able to introduce some dark themes from outside sources soon after his death. Voyager which followed it was much less diverse and much more dull it took a while to get off the ground. Diversity builds depth. The contrast in ideals really shows.Especially on a mission to a new area where everyone hopes to settle it makes sense that all species involved would send representatives. I think the Dominion War is good reason for this too. In American history when soldiers couldnt be paid they were promised land out West. I think the desire for exploration would be a fairly universal thing. Plenty of species would want in on a Federation approved chance to spread their species empire to new worlds. And Federation colonization is brought up frequently although never for long. It was mentioned on TNG quite a few times and I do remember they actually made an episode or two about visiting colonies. A large focus of TNG was exploring and helping people get settled safely on planets far away from home. Star Trek crews have offered replicators to people to colonize or rebuild quite a few times. I just think its a new aspect worth exploring that would be decently unique from the other shows in the franchise.I think its time we get to see an alien captain but what changes specifically would you suggest to the crew?

Riker was noted for being the best pilot on the ED and his first duty on the ship was to reconnect the saucer and stardrive of the ED manually which was apparently a good test of his talent.Now why the little craft?First theres the existence of fightercraft in the Federation Second is that these specific craft that Nova Squadron fly will be one person vessels because theyre meant for training pilots possibly without a lot of the automation youd find on larger ships so that if one of those systems does go under the pilot can still improvise. Theyd also be easier to learn train in and lose because theyre smaller cheaper ships with only one person in them. Theyd also be great for airshows spaceshows? if those still exist.But what benefit could this have for a starship pilot on a large vessel? Basics of evasive manuevers development of spatial awareness working with other shipsformations an appreciation for gravity wells that sort of thing. Odds are a lot of these skills developed in smaller ships still had application especially when piloting more nimble ships such as an akira or defiant class.Why are they visually unique? Because these are just unarmed training ships. They dont typically go far from base and are not suited to other roles.As for the emergency transport beacons the computer detected a critically low level of Plot Armor around the pilots and had them made up. But seriously probably because in those fightercraft theyd be going too fast to realistically maintain a transporter lock manually while on other missions they either expect the transporter to work correctly or not at all thanks to a broken system or a magic atmosphere or a cave with a special ore in it in which case emergency beacons wouldnt help out most likely. It might seem ridiculous for them to not go in with a backup just in case maybe its really easily detected since its a beacon and all and they forego it unless they have to. Thats the best inuniverse explanation I got. Out of universe you keep tricks that like underutilized to keep them from becoming stale to the audience and to indicate greater danger  if normal transport suffices so much it must really mean something for them to whip out this beacon.,DaystromInstitute,csccof4,25,t5_2whek

How did those antiwar members feel about having to send troops and supplies to the war effort and having their very survival threatened? Heck what about Federation members with divided opinions among their own people? How much internal political conflict would there have been within each Federation planetcolony? What will happen to those planetscolonies that did not believe the war was justified or worth the cost? Are they still willing to remain within the Federation?Well the US has had a series of unpopular wars but none of the states have seceded. Not exactly the same I know but I think the benefits of membership are still more important than the collective pride of one of these worlds governing bodies gtThere will also likely be a new balance of power within the Federation after the war. Planets that were more affected by the war may see their influence wane while planets less affected may see their influence grow. Earth will likely become even more powerful and prominent due to its central role in executing the war and all the industry mobilized for the war effort. Will everyone be happy with that change?Well I suppose that depends on how the fed. Government operates? I assume it is something like a cross between congress and the UN Sec. Council. If votes are based on population maybe. If not then I doubt we will see a dramatic shiftgtThen you have the reconstruction effort. We know that at least Benzar and Betazed were conquered by the Dominion. Earth itself was attacked although the damage wasnt that bad. How many other worlds were conquered or devastated by the Dominion? It may take a massive effort to rebuild those worlds. But how much help will each Federation member agree to provide? The Federation may be founded on mutual cooperation but the amount of resources required to rebuild the devastated worlds may require a lot of sacrifices from everyone. That may push the antiwar worldscolonies away even more since they already sacrificed a lot for something they didnt believe in and now theyre being asked to sacrifice even more.I feel like the destruction of actual federation worlds was not that bad. Starfleet definitely suffered massive losses but I got the sense that the dominion didnt just annihilate civilians needlessly until cardassia. That was more because the founder got pissed. Anyways the only occupied property we see besides cardassia is ds and they seemed to take a policy of appeasement theregtYou also have the problem of what theyre going to do with the Cardassians and the Breen. The official Federation policy will likely be to give all their territories back and help them rebuild. But is everyone going to be happy with that? So many sacrifices were made and so much blood was shed to win the war are people just going to be fine with letting the Cardassians and Breen off the hook? How many Federation members would want to hold the CardassianBreen territories they took for their resources and force the Cardassians and Breen to pay reparations?Cardassians they would help since its just the civillians left. They might hold trials of remaining military leaders. The Breen I doubt they would be able to get reparations with out further war. The Breen didnt loose their whole fleet like the cardassians and jemhadargtNot to mention all the problems theyll run into with the Klingons and Romulans. I doubt that theyd let go of the CardassianBreen territories they conquered and they certainly wont let the CardassiansBreen off the hook that easily. And what about Federation planetscolonies that were liberated by the Klingons or Romulans? Would the Klingons and Romulans just leave those worlds or will they attempt to lay claim on them? Is the Federation willing to fight another war to prevent the Klingons and Romulans from abusing the Cardassians and Breen or to take back the Federation planetscolonies they took?They have a staunch ally in Martok so the Klingons would negotiate. The Romulans probably didnt conquer that much territory but I could see some tensions and negotiations due to that scenario,DaystromInstitute,csj401m,3,t5_2whek
4378437,0,t1_csj3ymm,True but its also a good idea to have defense in depth as well and not leave your interior totally undefended. Avoiding the enemys main force and attacking their vulnerabilities directly is an ancient tactic and is even easier to pull off in space due to the large areas that need to be covered. Its really impossible to have a completely solid front line in space you can only really defend individual planets or star systems. Something like the Pacific theatre of Earths Second World War would be a better basis for interstellar war strategy than land warfare would be.And theres always the possibility that the enemy might break through your front lines but if you leave a small force defending the interior they may be able to repel the weakened enemy force or at least fight a delaying action to buy enough time to evacuate Earth.,DaystromInstitute,csj6ols,3,t5_2whek

Dorn has been in more episodes than anyone else. Weve seen his parents his marriages his son and fully explored his life in the Federation and in the Klingon Empire. The only thing we havent fleshed out is his childhood. What stories are there left to tell about Worf? If he isnt a fully explored character then no character is.Id love new episodes but I cant disagree more with Dorn in that there is more to tell. If there is anywhere to go its somewhere in the th century completely new worlds and stories. Keeping the past as a crutch wont get the show anywhere.

Its like having a friend let you look at their term paper after they got a shitty grade on it and thinking about how it could have easily gotten an A if theyd let you proof it before it was turned in. I already listed my two main problems with it in the previous thread but I could have also gone without the more slapsticky humor Scotty running into an overhanging pipe thats in perfectly clear view is a great example. A simple fix hes talking to whoever hes talking to in that scene does his ...like the back of my hand thing as hes backing down a side corridor hits his head mutters who the hell put that there or something that sounds really vile in Gaelic or just whips out a sonic wrench or something and hits it back.

That wouldnt fix the special effects production problems the first company dropped in their laps sending them over budget. Would the third movie do better with a different director instead? The story fits just right for the fourth movie so how would those changes cause issues with The Viyage Home?Suppose you remove Shatner as director of The Final Frontier? Instead do what Paramount wanted and made another comedy? Star Trek would just produce comedies until the humor died and the series followed afterwards.Generations might have done a lot better without being tied to Kirk instead allowed to do their own thing with a better director. Ignore the whole Nexus thing and focus on a madman helping the Duras sisters with the Romulans being a major player. Insurrection could have a complete rewrite and do without the space elves.And Nemesis should have been completely rewritten with a better director like La Var Burton instead of the jackass they had.And of course how many of the films would have done a ton better with even a few extra million to cover production costs?tldr there are too many issues and too many are interconnected to really say one fix would change everything.EDIT accidentally mixed up the movie names.,DaystromInstitute,csx238m,3,t5_2whek

4983397,0,t1_cumo67w,I think there is a difference between the limits of warp propulsion and the limits on the power system. Modern warp has a ceiling that no matter how much power you feed into it you cant hit warp . Burning out the engines could just mean pushing them to the point where you are bumping up against that ceiling and possibly creating some sort of feedback that burns out the engines like blowing a fuse by by sending a current through a  resistance circuit. Or as you said it could have been due to pushing against that ceiling while cloaked both being huge power drains possibly causing some feedback. I think that the Romulans being as advanced as they are would have this worked out extremely well.

I used the term selfish not as a insult but as a way to describe their mission. Star Treks mission is selfless while Farscapes is more survival based ie selfish. Farscapes more comfortable making flawed characters and allowing them to make more mistakes which leads to great character growth. On the flipside Star Trek tries to make a more perfectoptimistic world and characters you could look up to which is pretty difficult to make interesting and still manages to have character growth somehow. Both have great writing teams that know how to use social issues in their plots well. Its just when you get down to it the only major difference is selfless and the other selfish.

5027946,0,t3_3jsjmz,First off  youre not going to have some massive alliance of the Dominion  everybody else vs. the Borg. Its be the resources of all the Alpha and Gamma quadrants dedicated to growing literally billions of JemHadar and building millions of ships.I was one of the ones that commented in that Betazed occupation thread but I was suggesting things would be ok for the Betazoids as long as they didnt cause trouble and stayed on their planet although I dont think I mentioned that explicitly. Now that said full and immediate capitulation might actually work but itd be a massive sacrifice with far more far reaching conditions then youre suggesting. The Dominion has a specific goal and purpose a prime directive of their own if you will. With most nations if a national purpose exists at all its something vague like increase power or preserve our people or something like that. The Dominions prime directive is to prevent solids from wielding significant military or political power for the purpose of suppressing any threats to the Founders. This is why the Founders are happy to be so reclusive as to be considered myths and why the Dominion is so hands off with its member worlds. They dont care about what youre doing as long it doesnt constitute a threat to the Founders they dont care about your political ideologies or religious beliefs as long as they dont mandate conflict with the Founders and they dont care about your commercial activities as long as they dont undermine Dominion integrity and hence become a threat to the Founders. The Dominion only cares about political supremacy military power or scientific research in terms of how they can be used to suppress threats to the Founders.Hence while a total surrender might work out this would require the complete disarmament and dismantlement of all those nations. You arent going to have say the Romulans or the Federation as vassal states of the Dominion. Those states will be decomposed into independent worlds each of which have an independent relationship with the Dominion overloads and each of which will be isolated from each other. So in practical terms this would be the total and permanent destruction of the Federation RSE Klingon Empire etc ... The worlds would remain but the nations would be gone. I wouldnt at all be surprised to see the Dominion take harsh measures to suppress any lingering national identity. Maybe ban interstellar travel for a  or  generations for instance. The Dominion would do this for a very specific purpose because if no world has any ties to any other world then it would thoroughly suppress any possibility of the solids threatening the Founders which is what it always comes back to for the Dominion. This has already been done in the Gamma quadrent so theyre allowed a little more freedom. The Karemma can have unarmed ships for instance. Its true that they didnt do any of this with Cardassians but thats because they still needed the Cardassians for a time especially with the wormhole closed. In a total Dominion victory scenario the Cardassian Union is getting dismantled just like everyone else. So my point here is that this is one hell of a big sacrifice and your losing all autonomy outside of your planet. Itd be like if today the world was on the brink of World War III and you could surrender to avoid the war but if you did no one would ever be allowed to enter or leave your city again nor could you talk to anyone outside of your city nor conduct business with anyone outside of your city. Thats a damn high price to pay unless you really do think you have zero chance and history has shown that plenty of people would fight a doomed war anyway rather then take a deal like that.

5050862,0,t3_3k4zg0,I dont know that an answer will be so black and white as to say definitively one thing or another.  The truth is that it is probably both.  The technology depicted in Star Trek was the result of fanciful writers great directors a great founder and budgetary concerns famously transporters were invented so as to avoid costly shuttlecraft scenes.  Clearly fans of the show took these artcometechnologies and adapted them to suit the real world.However the opposite is true too.  When Star Trek was created the technological capacities of the United States were exponentiating.  The space race nuclear power laser technology and the like were ideas that the writers wanted to incorporate either through metaphor or as direct technologies that the Away Party used.  In an effort to showcase not only the technologies but also that they were commonplace in the future the writers took those ideas and improved upon them.  Not only were lasers incorporated into Star Trek but they were improved into these fanciful nadionemitting phasers.

In the Enterprise timeline Earths and eventually the Federations Starfleet would likely have held onto that information since the Klingons were a constant threat in case it was useful. Remember after all during DSs Trials and Tribbleations OBrien is surprised to see Klingons with no ridges and Worf just says we do not discuss it with outsiders.I dont think OBrien and Bashirs ignorance indicates that Starfleet was unaware of the virus or its effects and I am not at all surprised that Klingons are none too keen to discuss the situation with outsiders.

Even after having her natural biology restored to the point where the Borg no longer had direct influence on her actions she still remained firmly on their side and tried several times to return to them.

With trillions of drones estimating half are able to reproduce female they could grow their numbers far greater than any rate of assimilation would get them. They dont do it because its not part of their programming. I would call this a weakness.Consider this Human pregnancy takes  months to develop a baby which is nearly defenseless and usually takes two adults a number of years to keep it alive until they can fully develop and become independent. A single drone can create a new fully functional drone in under a day and that drone can create another and another...Even if they can only harvest a certain number of drones they still still save an enumerable amount of resources by completely skipping child rearing. If it was more efficient for them to have children then the Borg would have them.gt Their lack of free thought is a serious weakness. They basically lucked out on Voyager being close enough to the war to offer a solution.I mostly agree their limited creative ability is a massive weakness for them but just like everything theyre adapting to that which is why they have a Queen in the first place. But they wouldnt have ceased to exist if species  had won the war they would have another catastrophe Sevens recount of fragmented memory  years ago and rebuilt.gt The Borg are closer to a large fungal colony if anything single driving force singular consciousnesses. There is no individuality thus once connected each member is no different than a new appendage. So i would argue they are not a society personally.This doesnt seem right to me when Seven of Nine talks about the collective she mentions countless voices talking all at once which would lend to the theory that theres some degree of separation.

5182960,0,t1_cvamv2a,Voyager was operating along a contentious region of space. It was operating with less than a maxed out crew compliment. It was not fully supplied. The Intrepid class is an Explorer Type vessel. Its a smaller alternative to the Galaxy class for deep space operations. The pilot episode for Voyager marks a turning point for the FederationMaquis relationship. Prior to this episode the Maquis is a nuisance. From here Starfleet is now infiltrating the Maquis and sending a state of the art Deep Space Cruiser to intercept the maquis. No there were no civilians on board at the time. If Voyager came from Utopia Planitia it would be silly to not have it filled up when it made its first cruise out to the a anorak Sector. People and materials. That stuff was then offloaded prior to the beginning of the mission. This actually helps explain why there were not enough officers to replace the senior staff with Starfleet personnel once casualties were incurred. Janeway was forced to replace her XO Senior CoNN officer Chief Engineer with Maquis. There was no one to replace the medical staff. The terms Chief Engineer and Chief Medical officer leads one to deduce that there is redundant staff to cover at least  shifts for standard operations. Not on Voyager. Why is that?Now as to Customer Service. Nothing about transports requires the engineering staff to interact with guests. Neither would navigation or Science staff. Passenger relations would be handled by crewmen not senior staff. All those redshirt crewman we see in the corridors do something. This is a likely job. If you cant prove you can handle cranky passengers how are you ever going to be trusted with diplomatic contact?  We see lots of red shirt crew and have no idea what a red shirt petty officer actually does. Private contractors could handle this load too. Personnel transports is not the same as a Princess Cruiseline. No star fleet vessels are not running tourists out to see the rings of Saturn. They very likely are moving the families of workers out to the edge of federation space. Environmental engineers out to star bases administrative officials to new colonies students to and from their home systems to medical school or engineering schools. This isnt ideal transport either. Think the Britania or the Titanic more than the Princess of the Sea. This isnt perfect travel either. You are at the mercy of Starfleet mission objectives as a passenger. If the Captain changes course for any reason civilian schedules are going to be a low priority for him. Unless the ship is purely for transport like an old Excelsior running from Earth to Risa.  As to Shipyard allotments the idea that the Federation has developed a post capitalist economy gets in the way. There is not an unlimited supply of stuff. If there were every ship would have ablative armor but they dont. And federation citizens are more likely to support multi mission star fleet vessels than ore transports. Traversing Federation space is no easy feat. Warp  is really very fast in Star Trek. Warp  is staggeringly faster. A warp  vessel is still going to take a year or more to move from Rigel to Antares. The TV shows and especially the movies are flagrant violators of speed and distance. The ships are occasionally powered by PlotDrive systems that beak the math that the Star Trek creators laid out. Fans who try to create accurate maps for Star Trek have gone through painful contortions to explain certain episodes. Yet as a case in point the USS Equinox is a Nova Class Survey vessel. This is a newer design with an exceptional space frame. The class is still in existence in a future timeline where Harry Kim commands the USS Rhode Island. Also in the future battle that Daniels shows Archer where the XindiFederation alliance defeats the sphere builders. Thats the early th century. The Equinox has a cruising speed of Warp  and a top speed of Warp. This is a new design Starfleet survey scout ship.

5215269,0,t3_3meab3,Im going to copy a former thread of mineNow that Im older I totally see this. gt JELLICO Lets drop the ranks for a moment.beat then bluntI dont like you. I think youreinsubordinate. Arrogant.willful. I dont think you werea particularly good first officer.All of Jellicos critiques are valid. I think its clear from the end that Jellico had a plan and that he was bluffing when he chose to leave Picard earlier. A poor gamble perhaps. Maybe he could have trusted the others with the plan but that was his prerogative and trust is earned in both directions. He ordered Riker to have shift changes ready at a certain time and Riker allowed the department heads preferences to take precedence over the Captains orders delaying the transition for everyone. If Riker had concerns he could have brought it up immediately May I ask why sir? Sure the captain could have volunteered this info but its obvious he is a lesstalkmoreaction guy than Picard. In other words Riker hasnt behaved in a way that makes Jellico think he can trust Riker with sharing the details his plan.Rikers response Then ask. was a pretty asshole attitude response. I was appalled watching this recently. Adding to this Riker publicly questioning Captain Jellicos orders is exactly the reason Worf got a dressing down from Acting Captain Data in that awesome scene in Gambit edited down for relevance  gt DATAYou continually question my ordersin front of the crew. I do notthink this is appropriatebehavior.gt WORFSir... with all due respect Ihave always felt free to voice myopinions... even when theydiffered from those of CaptainPicard or Commander Riker.gt DATA...... The primary role of thesecond in command is to carry outthe decisions of the Captain... inthis case me...... once I have made adecision it is your job to carryit out regardless of how you maypersonally feel. Any furtherobjections should be given to mein private not in front of thecrew.beatI do not recall Commander Rikerever publicly showing irritationwith his Captain as you did amoment ago.You can put Riker in Worfs place and see that all those criticisms are transferable to Rikers interactions with Jellico. ,DaystromInstitute,cvemsnw,17,t5_2whek

He alienated the most valuable member of his crewsCollaborative approaches only take more time to succeed if youre not good at them. Especially when the team has already been working together for a long time. People are more likely to buy in and follow directions when they think theyve been heard and had some input. If he really wanted to be sure they would follow his orders he wouldnt have shut them out at every opportunity.As for disobeying orders riker assumed that the captain might value input from the crew.

It perfectly balances its serious tone its humor and its action in a way that only Nick Meyer could really achieve. Its the kind of movie you could show to a nonfan and they would still be able to enjoy it as a movie. . Nick Meyer has a knack for making Starfleet more believable as a organization. He really ran with the idea that Roddenberry first put forth that Kirk was a Horatio Hornblower in space. As such he made Starfleet into a believable political scientific and military organization in a way that no other could.

5258110,0,t1_cvjr0k0,Its limited and Hollywood think to go back to the moment of Demise. Thats what made First Contact so awkward. They should have gone back another  years and jumped to Vulcan. Hollywood doesnt care about Vulcan and the Borg would be the Federation in the th century. now if the Borg went back to the beginning and assimilated everything it would be aggressive enough to provoke the Temporal Factions to action? The Borg are always aggressive its their defining feature. They were aggressive in First Contact in a way that should have set off the alarms at every Temporal Faction headquarters in history but no one did anything. Except Picard who was already known to have done it even though he didnt know yet?  These causality loops are silly. The Borg are aggressive enough to need to be eliminated by virtually everyone. Weve yet to see anyone who benefits from the Borg not even a parasitic beneficiary. I agree that Time Travel is the nuclear option and Star Trek has shot itself in the foot with it. First Contact was bad enough then they piled it on with ENT. I liked both of those from a story point of view. But from an overall viewpoint they were whiffs. Im convinced that Paramount hates continuity. They want compartmentalized projects. All the time travel shenanigans allow that by confusing any continuity that may have existed. My  season run was in reference to a new show not one with Borg in every episode. A new show set in the th th centuries HAS to resolve the Borg thread its been built up to much not to. People still want to know what happened after the Dominion War  years later and the Dominion has a tenth of the Borgs profile. They painted themselves into a corner I think. They overused the Borg to start then confounded them then tied them in to the movies and stopped just stopped. Put em over to the back burner. That was a giant mistake and I do not doubt that it killed the TNG movies. Who cared about space hippies and clone Picard? No one. No one outside of die hard Trek fans anyway. The movies arent for Die Hard Trek fans they are for the general public. This is what Im getting at. The Borg got too big of a buildup and then got shelved and it hurt Star Trek.

Their society does move towards democracy despite opposition in beta canon but they elect that path on their own not from having it forced on them by occupiers.Im pretty sure the Cardassians are occupied after the war and their decision to move to a democratic society was definitely influenced by both the war and their occupiers.

5435752,0,t3_3pi431,Speaking to your mention of the Cyclons assimilating aspects of humans remember they didnt want to be us at all. But they felt we had qualities they lacked so they were looking to assimilate THOSE qualities.      Mainly reproduction to endure the survival of there species and to follow their Gods commandments to be fruitful and multiply.          Minus any of my own Bias since Im working on the Borg I think you are right that some of the overlapping themes apply.        For example The Borg seek perfection and the Cyclons seek the sort of perfection that can only be achieved by being closer to their monolithic God.  This leads both to a path of interaction with humans.           There is also the obvious be careful what technology can become theme.         A striking difference I see though is the emotionalism of the Cyclons verses the Borg. The Cyclons are steeped in emotional expression and exploration of themes such as love hatred vengeance retribution.  The Borg seem largely disinterested in the subjective with all their desires being more objective in nature.           That said I think Battlestar was one of the best scifi put on screen in the past decade simply because they were the first show to ask are we worth saving and then spend the entire series exploring that theme showing the worst and sometimes best of us.  A very different theme than star trek which starts with the assumption we can be better and then tries to show us how.            I believe the Cyclons as a product of man tell us more about US as their creators than the Borg  sort of how a child tells you all you need to know about the parent.     ,DaystromInstitute,cw6gzsk,8,t5_2whek

5664384,0,t1_cwyw4c5,I was about to start listing individual things such as Species  from Voyager but then I remembered was that the real problem with them was that they were created to have a foe that even the Borg were scared of... and that the real problem was that the Borg had been repeatedly jobbed until the crew of a ship that had no external support from Starfleet or anyone else could just waltz in and steal their transwarp coils or use their conduits or whatever else they wanted. Theyre supposed to be able to adapt to shit like that so that you shouldnt be able to use it again they should get tougher to beat not easier. As a general principle they shouldnt set up the archfoes so that all anyone has to do is reverse the polarity on the pluttifikanium coils and suddenly these galaxystompers get turned into giggling spacekittens. Gotta agree on Worf although hes my secondfavorite character after Spock. Sorry Michael Dorn but your guy has the most appearances of any character in the franchise.Time travel isnt totally undoable but I would think that having a Temporal Starfleet in the th century would mean that theyd stop a lot of this stuff from happening.

5738448,0,t3_3tqax5,The stardates and the episodes dont match up here.  Sacred Ground comes right after Basics Part II.  I dont think anyone on Voyager other than Janeway would have made the leap required to save Kes...Chakotay may have gotten close but I think his doubt would be enough to prevent him from understanding how to save her and no one else would have respected their beliefs enough to attempt the Sacred Ritual.  So Kes dies.  False Profits happened pretty quick after.  According to the dialogue they were able to detect the Barzan wormhole where it had appeared six months prior so the three months not lost in Resolutions wont really matter just means the traces they picked up will be less stale.  In the episode Janeway had to convince Tuvok of the logic of removing the Ferengi but I think he would have come to that logical conclusion by himself.  Now Tuvok may be Captain at this point in our timeline but he was a security officer before and that will colour his experiences in the same way that Janeway being a scientist coloured hers.  This suggests to me that Tuvok would have dealt with the situation here in a more decisive manner sending a security team to nab the Ferengi.  In the episodes they had no problems beaming the Ferengi up right in front of Kafar whose presence would have been easily detectable by their sensors and I dont think Arridors arguments about cultural interference would be effective on Tuvok.

5739750,0,t3_3tqjh2,Phlox may not believe in the Hippocratic Oath but Id presume hed need to take it in order to be approved to practice medicine on Earth and in Starfleet. I completely disagree with Archers decision and if that puts me on the wrong side of the Prime Directive so be it. Its a doctrine not the infallible word of God despite how its treated at times. Archer encounters a species that while lacking warp drive is already contaminated. Given other examples of Starfleet in its hippiest era dealing with prewarp species Angel One I assume this removes many of the traditional issues with interfering with them. This species is suffering from a genetic mutation that selects for death in a nonsuccessful way. Now the way this all is treated seems to be to indicate modern Trek humans allow TaySachs Trisonomy and cystic fibrosis to die for their absolute refusal to change evolution. After all its their genetic destiny. Thats morally repugnant to me. They have arbitrarily declared all deaths as a result of genetic conditions to be sacrosanct why not allow viruses and bacteria to have free reign. If nature expected us to live to the ripe old age of  itd have evolved us a better immune system and allow us to regrow limbs in the event they become injured in some way. As to your claim that they should develop their own way of dealing with it THEY DID. Their solution was We dont have medical technology necessary to solve this. So lets try and find people who do. There is no evidence given in the episode that they will be able to solve the issue in time. Hell Phlox seems to be excited for them to go extinct so that seems to indicate that they probably dont have the technology to solve it. But even then Archer gives them something to solve the symptoms. So he doesnt even obey your ideal version of a Prime Directive. If they wanted to take a firm noninterference proxenocide position Archer should have never given them anything curing the symptoms for a decade while denying them a cure seems arbitrary cruel and immoral in either way. ,DaystromInstitute,cx8klou,7,t5_2whek

That is just the practical reality of making TV.  On the effects side there literally is no way to make a majority of the cast nonhuman with makeup well not if you want the money to do anything else.  On the writing side you have to make the stories appeal to the audience.  That will manifest as a human centric view because it is a show written by humans.I wish there was a good inuniverse explanation.

5809222,0,t3_3unrk8,I have the same pet theory that the borg are tech farmers.  We see in Voyager that they often gobble up species only when they get to a certain level of advancement. They also skip over species that offer nothing like the Kazon.So here is my theoryFuture Borg Queen in  or later is duking it out with the Federation Delta Fleet. After a century of assimilation and attacks the Federation is now determined to totally and completely disrupt the Borg ability to assimilate anyone and anything. The Federation by this point is made up of the majority of species in the Alpha AND Beta quadrants. Klingons Romulans Cardassians? You name it theyre Fed now.The Borg Queen sees this alliance as unacceptable because it is becoming too powerful much too quickly.  The Borg Queen also doesnt like to tamper with the timeline too much so she concocts a plan to send instructions back to herself during an era when the timeline is alreayd fucked up because Warlord Janeway and Picard have disrupted things so extremely.  During the fight with EntE etc outside Earth Borg Queen receives a signal that explains that she must go further back to the moment of Warp Travel for whatever reason and head it all off at the pass.The rationale is that the Federation stability is too much to counter effectively. The Dominion war has changed federation thinking entirely. They are now capable of dominating militarily any power in two entire quadrants and will never EVER let their fleet become as aged and decrepit as the Excelsior fleet became.She fails to do what she wants creating the Federation by accident. She is now trapped in a predestination paradox. Any feint or move she makes just winds up being unmade and getting the same result. So she stops trying to tamper.Anyway thats my theory.,DaystromInstitute,cxh6tbk,2,t5_2whek

I know that most people arent going to hold the series as dear as I do simply because for many people its just a really enjoyable television show or a pleasant piece of nostalgia. For me its somewhat physically and emotionally painful because growing up TNG provided solace and kinship that I really didnt have due to home issues and severe bullying. TNG became the de facto family and friend circle I had until my adult life so for me the ideals and lessons learned in the show are distinctly tied into the person Ive become. Seeing something commercialized that youve tied into your self worth and identity is always going to be gut wrenching and honestly its always been a commercial venture but it took me growing up to begin to realize that as I imagine many kids experienced with entertainment from their formative years.  Id agree that keeping the series going is probably the best outcome for all regardless of whether its just a money grab. Im really hoping that Justin Lin does something amazing here truly Im not rooting for him to fail though just trying to remember the first duty of any SF officer.   Side note I actually dont dislike the FampF series. Its delicious action junk food and there are few things that have been so perfectly crafted towards the audience its intended to reach.

How fast they can breed JemHadar doesnt matter as the Borg dont engage in planetary combat.  They just carve the planet up from orbit and assimilate what they find interesting.    The reason that the Borg had so much trouble against Species  was because their technology and biology was completely resistant to assimilation as well as the physical effects of their weaponry.

But I dont see the Borg caring much who rules the Alpha Quadrant. They may feel comfortable stepping back and taking the long view. Maybe the Federation and the other local powers shake the Dominion off maybe they dont. Either way the people and resources of the Alpha Quadrant will still keep building and struggling.

6172945,0,t1_cyr17qo,No its not my point and Im sorry if my fencing crossed into unkindness. Im just saying that were in angelsonheadsofpins territory. Its not fuck it its science fiction its this is exceedingly soft science fiction where the founder gave his staff admonishments to keep it all vague so they could do what they please so lets keep a leash on how much we care when our curiosity about the widgets exceeds the resolution of the story. And when that approach was eventually buried by a preponderance of repeat encounters and curious fans like ourselves who garnered some measure of pleasure from knowing what was behind panel XYZ or how a warp drive worked they started to develop buzzwords and general behaviors for those buzzwords and it seems somewhat important to you that one magic wand the transporter not utilize one of those buzzwords when it seems to me that it fits pretty well and was I think what the people who touched scripts and cared about such things had in mind. And make no mistake some magic is called for. Youre right lots of materials are transparent to assorted breeds of radiation but if youre pumping enough energy at high enough density to turn it back into heaps of matter at the other end youre still depositing meltinglevels of energy into the intervening matter even if youre dealing with radio waves or neutrinos. Something imaginary is called for and subspace seems to fit the bill. But if you would rather label that black box something else sure okay. The likes of the Okudas and Sternbachs and Co. tasked with filling in all the TECH the TECH spots in scripts and in general trying to throw a lasso around all this wild invention seemed to be heading down a path where most of the stuff that was a patent violation of physics as we knew it warp drives and forcefields in their assorted containment shield gravity antigrav tractor and damper forms and all the rule breaking radiations novel particles FTL communications and spatial anomalies in which space didnt behave like space making tunnels and knots and everything but curving and twisting around big heaps of mass was the result of a whole new field of physics involving subspace not unlike Mass Effects well mass effect.  Which makes sense just like relativity opened a lot of door so might the next breakthrough change the rules. So they stuck things implying as much in the writers tech bible that turned into the Tech Manual and it seemed to rub off on the onscreen product hence Data saying of the Borg the signals are interactive across a subspace domain similar to that of a transporter beam I looked it upand the transporter inventors son being trapped by an experimental transporter in a subspace node.And whatever its all good if it suits you best that a transporter run on aether and phlogiston knock yourself out this business got reworked to power a new shiny fable time and time again and thats kind of my point that they are first and foremost black boxes to set up moral puzzles and enable adventures not pique scientific pondering they cannot withstand. ,DaystromInstitute,cyrat3u,1,t5_2whek
6189359,0,t3_40729d,I think using on screen evidence that Star Trek has much more effective weapons technology. Star Wars defensive screens seem to be more or less invincible until they get shut off. Im not sure any of this matters though. The two universes are very different in other ways that are less clear but far more telling. In Star Trek military engagements happen in deep space and heavily rely on Maneuver speed and tactics matter. This is necessitated by the reality that they have the ability to destroy whole solar systems forget individual planets. In Star Wars military engagements are heavily ground based. Taking the real estate and establishing dominance matters. This implies an overarching strategy that isnt readily apparent. There is an economic element to this that neither franchise ever discusses. Building a fleet of ships is expensive. Maintaining a fleet is also expensive. While its not obvious maintaining a large ground force is very expensive and requires the expensive logistics of moving a large ground force. From this money and manpower is seemingly unlimited in Star Wars. Star Trek has a shortage of manpower but established economic systems that alleviate the money issues. Going from comparisons of modern military doctrines and practices which can be awkward given the state of modern military dynamics when coupled with geopolitical and economic integration the Empire and perhaps the First Order are operating under some system that resembles the economic management of communism. The Rebellion and its funding is never explained but must be benefiting from from some form of planetary patronage. I say this because the current American ground forces are enormously expensive. Roughly half of the Army and Marine budgets go to payroll. Our soldiers and marines are very well paid however. They are well above the median income of any given region of the US save the heavily urban areas of NewYork Chicago and DC. In those places they get subsidies to offset cost of living variances. The United States couldnt afford to wage war the way that they do in Star Wars. Not given our economic system. We also lack the type of manpower that you see in Star Wars. It is seemingly unlimited. The US Navy is also payroll intensive. The largest cost in fleet operations is payroll over a given length of time in any ships service life. This is why all modern ship designs are as automated as possible to reduce crew levels. We have seen that the loss of assets ships hurts in Star Trek. It is the human cost that is focused on. This is why I say that manpower is enormously more important. There is a shortage. Starfleet Personel is also highly trained in comparison to Star Wars Personel. What we see in Star Wars is an almost unlimited access to men and resources and an infrastructure that is functionally galactic. This has oddly left them with more military capability but less military competence. They do stupid things and the commanders give stupid orders. In Star Trek every force needs to innovate to stay competitive. This is because everything is limited. Manpower resources and the ability to get from points A to B efficiently. They have to work smarter or they get crushed. Every force in Star Trek is supported by a Nationalistic Socialist government. Even the feudal Klingons fall into this at the Macro Level of government. This form of government is all we have as a comparison to create the type of forces that we see in the future. In Star Wars we have evidence that powerful Oligarchs control whole sections of the Galaxy. Planet sized factories planetary monarchs and private armies. That changes a great many things. Even crappy planets seem to be populated and the population is trapped in a very real sense on some of them especially those outside of the Core Republic. That power imbalance and heavy and poorly articulated factionization is what led to the creation of the original Deathstar. A clunky terror weapon. It doesnt seem to be designed to impose order or establish dominance. It is designed to destroy a planet and inflict serious material damage. The latter Deathstars seem to attempt a similar objective. They dont conquer they destroy. The prove that one side is right by eliminating anyone who might disagree. If opposing forces were to control multiple Deathstars the Galaxy would be in poor shape. Given the amount of work involved in this endeavor thats a telling state of galactic affairs. Life is cheap. Material can be wasted. Winning is all that matters. In Star Trek destroying a planet is relatively easy but the waste is unacceptable. Everyone needs more labor and more raw materials. Winning matters but the cost of winning is just as important. Spend to much and its lights out for your faction. Laying waste to whole planets is stupid and everyone seems to get that. They all acknowledge that mutually assured destruction is a real and terrible thing. In this Star Trek is more modern this is a post Cold War Storyline where influence trumps control. Star Wars is a throwback to the WW era where control is dominance and influence is irrelevant. tldr.Star Trek has better weapons and more firepower. Star Wars has better logistics and more manpower. This makes Star Wars more destructive and less precise. In Star Trek cost matters. Despite all the nonsense about post scarcity and the much higher standard of living overall. ,DaystromInstitute,cyt5ycr,5,t5_2whek

6463042,0,t1_cznsvj8,Possibly. But I suspect the Q play a little fast and loose with the term omnipotent. I suspect theyre capable of traveling backwards in time which is how they can be omnipotent.But to travel back in time and tell everyone whats about to happen you have to experience it first. True omnipotence would be to know what will happen without having to be there and then go back in time.Thats a fine distinction but an important one. If someone is planning to shoot me on the way home from work today and Im omnipotent Ill know what their plans are and will be able to take steps to avoid them. If Im only a time traveler then I wont be able to tell my past self to avoid getting shot because I wont know that I need to tell me that until I get shot and its hard to speak or travel through time when youre dead.Regarding the Q if theyre not truly omnipotent then they need to see the Borg infiltrate the continuum and destroy the Q before they can go back in time and be aware that the Borg will infiltrate the continuum and destroy the Q in time to stop it. This would necessitate eliminating the Borg threat before the Borg are capable of being a threat.The reason I suspect theyre not truly omnipotent is that if they are none of the events involving Q that we see in the show make any sense. For instance why did Q act like such an asshole if he was omnipotent and could tell that it would result in him being dumped naked and powerless on the Enterprise? Why did the other Q wait until Q learned his lesson to give him his powers back? Q is omnipotent and can learn the lesson by simply peering through to the future and deciding not to be an asshole before the point where he pisses the continuum off enough to strip him of his powers.,DaystromInstitute,czntmq9,1,t5_2whek

Hes not emotionally ready to lead others hell hes not emotionally ready to know what he even wants to do with his life really. I think Picard knows that and because Data could conceivably live for millennia hes letting Data plateau for a while because where he is now is one of the best places he could be. Enough authority to see how he feels about and performs in that role but enough superiors to know there are limits and of course surrounded by people who consider him family and like to encourage his growth.I think many good captains will take similar stances on lengthening Vulcan progression and perhaps reducing that of fastermaturing species  so that proportionately an excellent Vulcan and an excellent human might spend very similar percentages of their lives at various stages of rank.

In WW the Axis invasion of the Balkans turned out to be a total clusterfuck.

I think we can assume it was a Federation space station from what we saw in The Trouble with Tribbles.Next at the end of the meeting where Spock briefs the admirals Scotty mentions that he just bought a boat.  While that doesnt have to mean he paid money for a boat it goes along with what happens in TTWT.Im going to suggest that being money free is just a result of of the quest and turning into a utopia.If you can have whatever you want whenever you want it  you no longer feel a pressing need to go out and get one before they are gone or while they are still available.

6630836,0,t1_d04qjwm,But that example was dealing with travelling at .c not moving at Warp Speed. There is a HUGE difference. When in a warp bubble you are not actually moving at FTL speeds you are squeezing spacetime in front of you to skip it. So time in the bubble moves the same speed as the folks back home. They are covering distance quickly but not actually moving quickly. IIRC starships dont move at relativistic speeds in impulse. I read somewhere that  full impulse is .c not .c. That could cause problems actually. I think moving at Warp would be less resource intensive than actually moving that fast conventionally.Edit Actually reading further .c does not cause anywhere near the time delay issues that you get at .c because its logarithmic. Youre looking at an hour or something time dilation if moving at full impulse for a whole day. Really FTL communication is problematic at ANY speed. For instance you could setup an FTL communication between a computer that is operating aboard a jet flying around and a computer on the ground. When the lottery numbers are announced you transmit them back and forth and back and forth. Because the communication is technically arriving before it was sent if you send it back and forth enough times eventually you will receive the communication early enough to be able to walk to the corner store and play the numbers.,DaystromInstitute,d056ovn,3,t5_2whek

6892478,0,t1_d0xk7ye,gt I wonder how the UT would handle song lyrics. Would it be a direct translation that does its best to preserve the melodyrhythm? Or would it be a more poetic translation to accommodate rhyme and flow? Maybe both?Fascinating. I have no idea at all haha. I am unable to make an in universe explanation other than an educated guess. I would assume that the program does not translate what it recognizes as music andor that the translator would provide a literal translation of the phrases over top of the song as it is sung. The only thing I have to support that theory is that the UT has been shown to lack the ability to translate a metaphorical manner of speaking and instead makes literal translations.As for the music itself. I fall back on the brainwave idea that the translator works on the ability to translate the brain patterns that it identifies as direct communication. Music would still be deemed communication but rather it being communicative of thoughts and descriptions music comes from feeling and therefore would be untranslatable or maybe even too complex to put into words other than love passion angst. And would likely be omitted from being translated in efforts to not confuse the listener.Specifically on the chromatic scale I am puzzled to even come up with a guess. It is way outside my wheelhouse to even venture a guess haha. I think I need to watch some of the musical episodes. Because you bring up a good point. Think about Rikers trombone when heard by a non native listener. I would venture to say that what is considered good music to some would be abrasive to other species much like metal is to country music fans haha. Is human music translated to an alien equivalent? Or do nonhumans just avoid trombones? Lol.The only scifi that I can think of that even addressed the difference in the ability to appreciate music by species was Stargate SG where the automated alien ship is terraforming a planet with a humanlike species on it. The alien ship creates a living Android version of one of the humanlike people and he plays the aliens music only to comment that it does not appeal to his auditory faculties and that he would need a wider range in order to fully grasp it.

Tuvok is a Vulcan example and a nameless senator from ENT is a Romulan example. I think also one of Neros crew. Tomalaktype. Pale skin ridges. Most TNGandpost Romulans. No Vulcan examples.

Without Janeway though things would have been complicated. Going strictly by Starfleet policy Kim would have been captain as the senior surviving bridge crew member but he was a newly minted ensign fresh out of Starfleet Academy with zero practical experience. While he was a capable officer and had graduated as valedictorian which is hugely significant I think if you compare Voyagers likely survivability under Kim to Chakotay theres really little comparison to be made. There was no one to vouch for Tuvok so he likely would have remained out of the role of captain so I think the best solution would be some kind of temporary powersharing situation. Kim would have been responsible for the Starfleet officers and Chakotay for the Maquis and they probably would have worked out a slow integration plan eventually leading to Chakotay in command but with Tuvok as his first officer to keep him in check.

Surrounded by a panEuropean team. In that environment their sense of European identity became more prominent. As another example is an exflatmate of mine with one polish parent one german parent who grew up in switzerland went to an international school and visited her Spainish boyfriend in Madrid every six weeks while studying art here in London.  To her a European identity was much more true than any one nation.

I once knew a Cardassian a dashing handsome young man with a promising career. And then one day through no fault of his own he found himself exiled and alone with nowhere to turn. But did he give up? No. Instead he struck upon a brilliant plan. Rather than fleeing for the rest of his life he sought shelter in the one place no one expected him to go. In a stronghold of his peoples most hated enemies. There surrounded by hostile strangers he built a life. And there against all odds against the merciless logic of the Universe itself he thrived.,DaystromInstitute,d2ek3nc,12,t5_2whek

7401821,0,t3_4gojlb,Im thinking of the scene from Star Trek IV where Gillian Taylor runs against the side of the cloaked birdofprey and Kirk decides to beam her aboard because the temporal noninterference rule is more like a guideline. She starts to cry out with surprise before the transporter effect is even visually apparent. This indicates to me that one can feel themselves being beamed before the beaming becomes visually apparent since the transporter is likely doing something pretty crazy to your body before it snatches you up. The concern with somebody like Daniel Kwan  assuming that the explanation elsewhere in this thread about transporter interference isnt enough explanation  is that like with any suicidecrisis situation you dont want to force the personincrisis to have to make a hasty decision with only a split second to weigh their options. If Kwan had felt himself being beamed away he would probably have jumped immediately. Its why when someone is on the ledge you dont rush them or try to grab them. You dont want them thinking hastily or irrationally because thats probably what got them there in the first place. Or in a hostage crisis the armed raid to defuse the situation is the absolute option of last resort because when somebodys hand is forced like that they wont be thinking through the consequences of pulling the trigger all theyll be thinking is this is my only opportunity to pull the trigger. ,DaystromInstitute,d2jjdvh,5,t5_2whek

7672898,0,t1_d3e6v4d,gt  What I am searching for is the evidence that this is the case as opposed to simply being an advanced parlor trick. Parlor trick seems rather dismissive especially since youve likened it in another comment to Ardra in Devils Due. Ardra didnt have any real power she simply had advanced holograms. Q on the other hand actually accomplishes the things he claims to do.In Deja Q he inadvertently reveals something about how his powers work. When he tells Geordi how to fix the moons orbit he doesnt suggest transporting it or teleporting it he suggests changing the gravitational constant of the universe. Im going to assume that a more advanced version of Federation technology will operate along the same principles if the Enterprise could have moved the moon it would have done so with a larger tractor beam. Altering the fundamental principles of physics isnt anywhere within the realm of Federation science.Could Q theoretically have some sort of advanced gizmo he keeps with him at all times? Maybe one thats undetectable to any sensors or exists within some sort of portable extradimensional pocket? Sure. You can use enough handwavium to justify anything.The problem with this thought experiment is that it devolves into navelgazing. Nothing in the show or books that Ive read support this theory. In fact Id argue the spirit of the show flatout contradicts it.One of the longterm themes of TNG is the betterment of ones self. During the Farpoint mission humanitys morality is put on trial. Its not a question over whether mankind has the technology to survive in space its whether mankind deserves to be in space at all. In the end the Enterprise succeeds not because they were able to feed energy to the creature but because they were able to unravel the mystery and most importantly fought against their own best interests in exposing the crime.Just about every interaction with Q is along these lines the evolution of the species the morality of humanity and the Q the right Q has to torment them etc. Q wants them to expand beyond the trivialities of technology and physical limitations.From All Good Things...gt We wanted to see if you had the ability to expand your mind and your horizons... and for one brief moment you did.gt For that one fraction of a second you were open to options youd never considered. Thats the exploration that awaits you... not mapping stars and studying nebulae... but charting the unknowable possibilities of existence.That doesnt sound like technology to me. That sounds like evolution.So what it comes down tofor meis this Is Q lying to them the whole time? He could be but what is the point? Its a sevenyear charade for what purpose? A laugh? That isnt satisfying in any way whatsoever. From both a logical and thematic standpoint I think we have to take Q at face value.,DaystromInstitute,d3ed3lx,12,t5_2whek

7752450,0,t3_4lekxj,gt Is there anything in the betacanon that goes into detail about these parts of North America?We can extrapolate from the actual canon.  We know that Khans dictatorship alone stretched throughout Eurasia with nearly a third of the worlds population under his rule and that one of the belligerants of WW was something called the Eastern Coalition. Also the events of First Contact are likely occurring in the middle of the PostAtomic Horror but we see no evidence of anything like that in Bozeman.I would posit that the bulk of WW fighting hit the Old World the hardest. This would also provide a solidly inuniverse explanation for the lack of native Asian representation in Trek the only natively Asian main cast members being Hoshi Sato and possibly Julian Bashir although his and his fathers Anglicized names may indicate that he grew up in Europe and not South or West Asia. This excludes Harry Kim being an American from South Carolina and Hikaru Sulu being an American from San Francisco.On the basis of both proximity and modern day significance the East Coast of the Americas would be hit harder by the fighting as well.  This would leave the West Coast of the Americas as relatively the least impacted areas in the world when the fighting ended.

7785013,0,t1_d3qxjg6,The best we can say is potentially. Its possible that biological damage eventually exceeds what is efficient to repair and replace and that those drones are destroyedrecycled.However observing changes in the Borg habitus from Wolf  to the First Contact incident and Voyagers contact with drones in the Delta Quadrant  either drones were substantially retrofitted in that timeframe  the cube from Wolf  was particularly old  older drones are generally maintained closer to the core of Borg space and so we have little exposure to them or  drones are recycled over an unknown timeframe. I would propose a combination of  and . The cube from Wolf  was likely fairly old. If I recall correctly the cube was already en route to the Federation when Q placed the Enterprise in its path and its implied at varying points that the Borg first became aware of the Federation either from the crashed Borg ship in Enterprise or from their assimilation of the Hansens in the s. Even in the latter case the cube would have been traveling for at least a decade and as such the drones aboard looked fairly old as the technology on the cube itself was less advanced than home. It was however still perfectly functional and replacement outside of a drydock en route would have been deemed inefficient. The newest assimilation technologies would be most needed on the edges of Borg space where assimilation is occurring and mass movement of drones within Borg space is inefficient. Retrofitting old drones would similarly be seen as inefficient  likely the drones at the core of Borg space have been operating since their original assimilation. I believe the longestlasting drone we know of is Seven and her parents which had been assimilated for roughly  years. However its likely most drones last for at least a hundred years. We may also have seen newerlooking drones in Voyager due to the war with  which may have cleaned out a lot of older ships and drones.,DaystromInstitute,d3r3af1,3,t5_2whek

Eighthgear did refer specifically to a baby but I agree that without access to the same standards of nutrition and healthcare during development an older person from the ancient world would on average be shorter in stature and their height would cease to be responsive to the effects of diet and current medicine after they entered adulthood.Their intelligence and life expectancy though would be a more complicated question. Malnutrition in childhood can permanently affect cognitive development but of course not everyone in the ancient world was chronically malnourished.The ability to learn new skills and concepts neuroplasticity is also generally thought to decline with age so an older person from the ancient world might have more difficulty in those areas than a baby but this is a complex area and there is a great deal of variability among individuals many people retain the ability to master new skills well into old age and some talented polyglots begin learning languages long after their formal education ended. Some individuals in the ancient world also lived to ripe old ages.As long as our  year old from ancient Egypt hadnt suffered too badly as a child many born in times of famine did of course yet many were more fortunate I wouldnt rule out their chances of a long welladjusted life in the modern world.In the th century they might even be able to do something about their relatively reduced height  but apparently nobody would care about that anyway!,DaystromInstitute,d3seomo,1,t5_2whek

In the examples of convergent evolution you mention its true that we can appeal to recent common ancestry but look at e.g. dolphins and icythyosaurs and think about the radically different evolutionary paths taken to get there. Another example is the development of eyes in cephalopods and vertebrates In both cases it may simply be that theres only one biologically feasible strategy for dealing with the problem given the resources provided by DNA.Of course thats not going to be the case for every ecological niche or every problem of survival.

For this reason starship construction facilities seen at Utopia Planitia in Booby Trap and Earth Station McKinley in Family have been depicted as construction platforms rather than large replicators.

8969005,0,t1_d7lbwvy,gt But the Federation has obviously consciously chosen a different path that I think is based on a cultural change in human society rather than technology especially since that choice seems to predate replicators.I think the fact that the transition to a moneyless economy is supposed to have begun on Earth before good replicator technology became widely available is probably the strongest argument in favour of this theory.The ubiquitous replicators of the TNG era and later with their apparent ability to reproduce almost any physical object were not common in the TOS era if they existed at all. Prior to TNG similar but less capable technologies were in use aboard starships like Protein Resequencers in the nd century and Food Synthesizers in the rd century.Paris statement about the New World Economy in Voyagers fifth season episode Dark Frontier as well as other references establish that Earth had a moneyless economy by around   perhaps a century or more before true replicator technology was widely in use on Federation starships.Replicators might have existed on Earth in the TOS era in some form but if they did they were apparently not yet suitable for routine installation on starships which I think implies they would probably not have been widely available to civilians in domestic settings either even if they were being used to produce goods for public consumption.Perhaps they existed only in industrial settings like todays semiconductor fabrication plants or the roomsized computers of the s and s and were only suitable for narrow specialist uses but by the th century had undergone a Moores Lawesque revolution in their capabilities miniaturisation and efficiency that led to them becoming widely available.Interestingly there are several characters depicted in the shows who would have lived through the transition from the prereplicator to postreplicator eras particularly members of longlived species like Vulcans pretty much all Vulcan characters whose ages are known would qualify but also some humans such as McCoy.I do however still think the transition to a moneyless economy would require more than a cultural change I think both technology and culture would have a role with one enabling the other in a virtuous circle.I think the description of the Federation as a PostGreed society is insightful and correct though I agree with what others have said that certainly by the time of the th century the Federation is essentially a PostScarcity society too the distinction between practically limitless material abundance and actually limitless material abundance is I think largely academic as far as the effects on human motivations are concerned.I think that for most human beings there is a certain level of material wealth beyond which further acquisition is simply a power and prestige game that ultimately has very limited appeal and its that game that I think Picard is referring to in his interactions with Offenhouse in The Neutral Zone and Lily in First Contact.Judging by the onscreen evidence this critical level of material wealth which no doubt varies from person to person was achieved on Earth gradually with the assistance both of improvements in technology and organisation after and perhaps also partly before the cataclysmic setback of the third World War. The initial effect of these developments would probably be to cause significant reductions in the prices of many goods and services around the world. Goods that we now regard as luxuries or major investments would perhaps become so inexpensive as to make it practical for the voluntary or public sectors to provide them freely.By around the time of the nd century the material circumstances of the average person on Earth had apparently improved to the extent that the acquisition of money was no longer a significant motivation in their lives and it therefore fell out of general use. By the time of the th century replicators were in every home and the material scarcity that underpinned the workings of the economies of previous centuries became as alien to the average th century human as feudalism is to us or modern transport medicine plumbing electricity computers and communications would be to a Neolithic human.I dont think the appeal of material things would cease to exist in Star Treks th century rather its relative importance has dramatically subsided and greed and the envy associated with it has become pointless. If you would like some gadget fashion or other object to enjoy show off to your friends or provide to your family you can get it out of a machine in your home and so can everyone else you know. Competing for wealth under these circumstances or envying others for things you could obtain with trivial ease would be perverse the game would no longer be about survival or even comfort but a desire to outdo others on a meaningless metric.When nobody need strive to ensure their material needs are met and everyone has access to essentially whatever physical goods they might want the principal underlying causes of greed disappear a PostGreed society follows naturally from PostScarcity conditions. An economy in which material needs are satisfied in turn frees people of much of the need to sell their services for income and so if they choose people can make their skills available to others freely without any significant material penalty to themselves.People who wish to charge for their services in an environment in which any of their competitors could in principle provide the same service freely without suffering any material reduction in their standard living may find it much harder to find paying clients and so the utility of money in the service sector may also be substantially eroded  perhaps completely if an effective and wellorganised voluntary sector meets the remaining demand for services not replaced by automation.Many of the wealthiest people in todays world develop an interest in philanthropy and often the richer they are the more time they dedicate to it. In many cases theres no doubt an element of selfinterest to this prestige influence peer pressure etc. but more generally I think its a natural product of human nature when a persons own material needs and wants are satisfied the remaining pleasures are in improving yourself your environment and the lives of others.In a society in which all people rather than a minority find their material needs easily met perhaps we might expect all people to become potential philanthropists.,DaystromInstitute,d7pxsru,2,t5_2whek

9018516,0,t3_53o9w0,Heres my take on the Borg timeline A Borg cube travels back in time to s and tries to prevent the first contact. It is destroyed by the Enterprise E but some drones crash land in Antarctica and freeze. These drones are revived in s and destroyed by the NX Enterprise. Before they die they send a signal to the Delta Quadrant about their situation. The United Earth government gets their hands on Borg technology but decides to keep it secret. After a while the signal reaches the Borg in the Delta Quadrant. They are not interested in invading a planet on the opposite side of the galaxy but for some reason they try to resolve the predestination paradox by sending a single cube to Earth and then back in time  maybe they are aware of the temporal cold war and try to prevent some technologically superior temporal agents from messing with them if they leave the time paradox unresolved. So they dispatch a single vessel. At that point the Borg dont have transwarp travel or it is scarce so the cube takes very long time to reach Earth. Much later the Federation meets El Aurian refugees who mention the Borg. Because existing knowledge about the Borg is kept secret nobody really pays much attention to this. During the decades it takes the cube to reach Earth the Borg get much more technologically advanced and greatly expand their territory. The Hansens learn about the Borg from the secret Federation materials and go looking for them. Eventually they meet a Borg cube but this is not the same cube as the one that has been travelling from the Delta Quadrant to Earth. They follow a cube to the Delta Quadrant and get assimilated. Later the old cube sent to Earth decades earlier finally gets close to the Federation space. Q facilitates the Enterprise D meeting it. The cube looks very different from how the Borg look later in The First Contact and in VOY because at this point its technology is outdated. Also because its essentially a generation ship and it doesnt stop to assimilate on the way the Borg onboard are forced to grow new drones to replace dying ones. Thats why we see a baby drone in TNG Q Who which is something thats not seen later. Eventually this old cube reaches Earth and events of TNG The Best of Both Worlds transpire. The Borg fail. In response to this they send another cube which arrives in The First Contact. They are still not interested in assimilating Earth because its too far away. This cube is much more advanced and uses transwarp so it takes it much less time to get to Earth. It succeeds in traveling back in time which closes the loop.,DaystromInstitute,d7vvuvb,4,t5_2whek

So since we are never given a reason why Data created Lal we must infer a reason.I brought up the quotes I did specifically to explain that Lals building had a specific cause that wasnt Q as you claimed. Going back to the script Data explains that he has wanted to build an android for some time independent of Q.gtDATA That is why I must attempt this sir.

Its like if someone were to try to tell you that unicorns exist. Theres obviously no reallife evidence of the existence of unicorns so debating it is pointless. Theres simply nothing to discuss.

9098240,0,t1_d84txe5,Hmm I know that episode and stuff isnt canon but I could have sworn it had been mentioned before in other materials that Warp  is infinite speed and is impossible to achieve but I could naturally be wrong. The problem still comes from the scale theyre using to measure warp factors and so on I believe. I mean from an objective sense two ships that are both traveling  times the speed of light are traveling  times the speed of light but one ship could be using a scale that measures that as Warp  whereas the other ship could be using a scale where that speed is only like Warp  or something. Sort of like the difference between measuring speed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour. Im not sure how engine power in Trek translates to speed so Im not sure that if you want to go at speeds of c that means you need an engine four times as powerful as one that maxes out at c or if it actually might need to be  times as powerful or maybe only  times. And naturally the Warp Core isnt the only component factoring into the speed. Id assume better nacelles and conduits and all that junk would also help.,DaystromInstitute,d85gmmi,1,t5_2whek

9160880,0,t3_55qzy8,To decide whether Data is alive or not we have to first decide what life is. The definition of life is controversial in modern science and there is no one official definition used by scientists. It may indeed still be controversial in Starfleet. However NASA does have an official working definition of life that is used to guide their search for extraterrestrial life which would seem to be the most appropriate definition that we have as it aims to avoid constraining the definition to the particular kind of life we have seen on Earth. It may be the basis for whatever definition Starfleet uses.They define life as a selfsustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Is Data alive by that definition? No  he does not reproduce and therefore his species can not evolve. Although he could construct another android as he does with Lal this android can be as similar or different to Data as he desires rather than having some form of DNA that would constrain it to being similar to its parent. The kind of random genetic mutations copy errors essential to the evolution process are absent.Of course you could argue that this definition is insufficient  its certainly not universally agreed upon by scientists and its just a working definition by NASA. I think its important to note that the question of whether Data is alive or not is different from the question being asked by the JAG. Most life is not intelligent or selfaware so those qualities do Data no favours here.Others have said that it shouldnt matter if hes alive or not which is also certainly valid. In the end life is just a word useful for discussing various things like death or the exploration of the universe. But given that owning experimenting on and killing insects is generally thought to be acceptable while doing so on humans is not despite both being clearly alive by any definition I could find it would seem not to be a useful word for deciding whether Data is the property of starfleet or not.,DaystromInstitute,d8d7ixq,2,t5_2whek

Ascension carries with it powers which defy conventional physics. Ascended beings are powerful but still wish to keep their existence secret from the Borg. The Founders are not ascended but they are energy beings and can defy physics.Assumptions a The Founders failed ascension or they were forced from ascension by other ascended beings perhaps giving rise to their persecution complex. They are halfascended part material and part energy. b The Borg are a threat to ascended beings which is why ascended beings wish to keep their existence a secret from the Borg the odd assimilated drone which believes in omnipotent energy beings is easily dismissed by the collective. Ascended beings either lack the power to or wish to avoid the cost of destroying the Borg and have consequently manipulated races like humanity into doing so. c The Founders form a possible bridge from the material to the energy which would provide a way for Borg to understand and assault ascended beings.If the Borg were to discover The Founders they would develop the tools to assimilate not only The Founders but to assault and assimilate beings like the Q.

The Vulcans are the best example of this with their own scientific fleets and expeditions and a local government that controls access to the planet. Journey to Babel depicts the Federation as more or less an alliance of semiindependent members with their own economic interests.We know from DSs Acession that Bajors old caste system would have prevented its entry into the Federation but as far as Im aware this is the only time a local custom has been described as a fundamental barrier to Federation membership. Even the standard of a unified home planet TNGs Attached is not considered a hard rule. The standards for membership seem rather broad. Vulcans governmental system after ENT is vague at best but we do see what appears to be a sort of union of religious and governmental organizations. TPau is at once a priestess and a government official offered a seat on the Federation Council for instance. Bajors established religion governmental Vedek Assembly and Kai Winns status as First Minister do not seem to be bars to their entry to the Federation. So at least we can say that an established religion is not considered to be a problem.We also know that there are a set of fundamental rights afforded to Federation citizens TNGs Drumhead has a few examples and so at the very least it would seem that a planet would need to be willing to accept those precepts.Overall the Federation seems willing to accept many differences in member worlds and so I suspect that the only real restrictions on Federation membership would be an ability to accept the laws of the Federation presumably these laws would clash with Bajors caste system and the willingness of the other Federation worlds to accept them into the alliance.,DaystromInstitute,d921kdb,9,t5_2whek

As for the others his supposed role in the reckoning is deeply ambiguoushis role in initiating it may just as easily have been Pahwraith intervention as that of the Prophets. and we dont see the reckoning actually serve a purpose. His meddling in the affairs of Bajor may be done in the name of the Prophets but hes hardly doing it because they want him to. We see in Accession that the Prophets dont even really seem to have a concept of an Emissary its a role primarily fabricated by the Bajorans.gt If it did they are quite capable of getting to where they need to be and possessing a relevant humanThis is precisely my point if they can posses anyone anywhere in order to manipulate events why do they need Sisko? They can just possess random Federation diplomat  to stop Bajors admission to the Federation etc. If they have the power to manipulate events so that Sisko shows up and is the person they need him to be then Sisko is redundant.gt just make sure certain key events occur as they have already seen them occur... which might not even require interventionIf this as all they do then they dont really have control over events. Either they need to intervene and have the power to do so or they dont and what happens happens regardless of what the Prophets want.gt While the wording of the prophecies is often layer after layer of symbolism and metaphor even with all those layers were shown time and again that the prophecies are trueWere also shown that you can always interpret them such that they are true see Destiny. When youre free to interpret the words in increasingly vague and symbolic ways you can make them say anything. I dont doubt that the orbs sometimes show the future but I dont think we know that everything the Bajorans call a prophecy was the result of an orbhow many ancient Bajorans recorded fever dreams as gifts from the Prophets? Who knows how many mindaltering substances were taken in the interest of better communing with the orbs or understanding the Prophets. I also question your reading of them as implicit promisesthis requires a specific understanding of how the timeshenanigans work if nothing else it implies that the Prophecies could actually be false. I think we also have reason to believe that while many orb experiences may show the future they are not direct attempts to communicate by the Prophetswe see them show up and talk to Sisko when they want to but we seem to be lead to believe this isnt normal. I think the orbs should be seen more as probes sent out by the Prophets which contain something analogous to a radio if the Prophets want they can communicate over that radio they can even project themselves through it to possess someone but if you just fiddled with the radio you might be able to tune it to some random other communication or just get some static that seems meaningful and the inherent nonlinearity of the Prophets technology means that this noise can include information from the future.gt Hes flat out being told by beings with an eagles eye perspective on time that this is a really bad idea for BajorNo hes not being flat out told anything hes being shown a series of images which he interprets to mean it will be bad for Bajor. We see the Prophets talk to him if they want to tell him something this is hardly a case like that.gt They care about BajorWe have surprisingly little evidence for this considering its so commonly stated. In Sacrifice of Angels when Sisko tries to get the Prophets to stop Dominion reinforcements they definitively declare thar corporeal matters do not concern us its hard to reconcile such a statement with a genuine concern for Bajor in any way that we might understand. Sisko tries to argue that they do in fact care about Bajor but importantly he makes another argument at the same time that if they do not help him he will kill himself in a suicide run against the Dominion. We dont know which argument convinced the Prophets but given their seeming annoyance and declaration that a penance will be extracted Im inclined to think they were convinced by the blackmail part of his speech not the warmfuzzies for Bajor part. Its true that a Prophet does say following Siskos assertions that we are of Bajor but its unclear whether this is conceding that they care for Bajor or clarifying that they dont care and their relationship to Bajor is something else.gt we are told a Prophet makes her way to Earth and takes over a human body for a number of yearsI concede this is one point Ive never adequately been able to deal with. Personally Im inclined to believe the Prophets are just lying its a real anomaly in terms of what we see them capable of and the revelation comes just at a time when Sisko is beginning to doubt himself and his mission. It seems perfectly reasonable to me the Prophets tell him this to get him to keep doing what they want in particular to prime him for the sacrifices they need him to be willing to make like jumping into some fire with a book.gt I get that from a certain perpsective theyre using Sisko to defeat the PahWraiths once and for all... its a bit unnecessary though.This is what makes me inclined to believe the Prophets are dealing with forces they dont really understand. I think the most reasonable explanation is something along the lines of the Prophets casting the Pahwraiths out and imprisoning them in the fire caves. The limited ability of their kind to manipulate and traverse physical reality and linear time means they essentially stranded the Pahwraiths on Bajor in the same way you might want to surround a prison with impassable terrain. Their interest in Bajor is purely instrumental they want to protect the integrity of their prison. The nonlinear relationship the Prophets and by extension I assume the Pahwraiths have with time allowed the Pahwraiths to try and set in motion events in our world that would lead to their release in response the Prophets have recruited Sisko to be their agent in foiling the Pahwraiths schemes.,DaystromInstitute,da6rj73,3,t5_2whek

However I would like to hear what you think about the what I deem more credible possibility that these events are not really happening within our reality but Q is representing them to us in this format for our help?edit OR...  What about the possibility that Q bring their conflicts into the simulation because the actual death of a Q is so abhorrent to them?

If we assume any of the nexxus events to be true we must assume that picard is stupid and just doesnt get it that hes still in the nexxus.However this isnt the cannon explanation. So we are left with a giant gaping plot hole with only one logical conclusion.Like a lot of star trek episodes and movies one must assume the whole universe in some senses resets after the episode is over.Or the more likely explanation that the entire events of the film were an imagined fevered vision of trek emanating out of a fevered nightmare dream... and the whole movie never happened in reality.Which is a fine solution i think Lets suppose the entire movie started in the nexxus and is a story about the nexxus and that it is actually a stand alone instance of a nexxus mirror of star trek taking place entirely from start to finish inside of the nexxus.Neither picard nor kirk are real versions the whole movie is sorans nightmare in the nexxus emanating from over attachment to the nexxus a psychological inversion and then a narrative to give shape to first his rebellion to leave and then the consequences of leaving and then his desire to reenter.The whole film from start to finish takes place inside the nexxus.Otherwise the plot holes are so glaringly huge and continuity so violently blown that there is no possible explanation for the series of events all the way down to picard picking the most idiotic possible moment to intervene with saron.So now you have my alternative and continuity saving theory. the movie actually is from start to finish sarons nexxus dream.No kirks or picards or enterprises were ever harmed in the creation of this nexxus mock up fantasy.i see your kings flush but raise you a theory inversion,DaystromInstitute,dbakg02,1,t5_2whek

My initial foray into this topic was with the thread about Starfleets lack of contact with the Kyrians  itself a highly speculative thread  Observation contact and subsequent erasure is the concept I contributed to that thread to try and answer that OPs question. If we dig too deeply into multiverse stuff theres no reason why Starfleet wouldnt make first contact in that way because in a multiverse they already do somewhere.gtHow does classifying technology keep it away from people who are going to invent it anyway?It doesnt but it allows your civilization to get the upper hand. The Manhattan Project was classified because the US wanted a nuclear weapon before anyone else. That gives the US more time to be the most familiar and therefore most competent with the technology.

10261198,0,t3_5mvoks,I seem to recall Janeway mentioning to Chakotay during one of their notadate dinners that she slaved over a replicator program.  I like to think that the operative word there is program.  It would make some sense to me that with replicator technology the preparation is entirely automated but you can specify the process the food undergoes to appear as such on the plate.  Were not ever shown how specific the programming is or can be.  It could be a matter of just telling the computer something relatively general like roast this beef and some carrots and onions at  for  minutes.  Or it might be more precise like synthesize proteins this way to get the best approximation of beef and synthesize carbohydrates this way for the carrots then make the protein this temperature and the vegetables this temperature.  Or it could be really flexible and accept all manner of parameters limited only by the culinary knowledge and programming fluency of the chef.This brings to mind the relatively modern reallife field molecular gastronomy I think that while its novel and niche now in a future filled with automated replication of food at a molecular level it would be a useful field of study for most professional chefs.  One wonders to what degree cooks like Joseph and Ben Sisko would pay any attention to such things since they seem far more salt of the earth in their cooking.  Still overall I would bet that certain fields of study would be far more important to food preparation in the th century than the ones that are now.  On a starship the chemists and computer scientists might well be the bestequipped to make a delicious dinner.ampnbsp Of course this doesnt even touch on how the presentation of food would be handled by a computer program.

Considering the complexity of the computer systems it shouldnt be any more complex and perhaps significantly less than the thousands of detailed scans stored in medical files or of the last planet they visited.

I would still like to respond to them even if it may be extrapolation.gt However I would propose it is a defensive item intended to protect the occupants as opposed to an offensive arrangement.I see what you are saying.  I agree in one sense but not always.  For the most part we know phaser arrays on the Intrepid Defiant Galaxy and well really all of them are Class X phaser arrays. So if all ships have class X I dont see one being more aggressive than another they are just using the most advanced arrays they can.  The Sovereign does have Class XII arrays but then again it is also the newest and most advanced when it was built as Geordi says.  So is one ship more aggressive or defensive if they are all just using the most advanced they can. Now the Defiant has a different weapons system in pulse phasers and is built around those.  I think clearly that is built to fight more so than other designs.  Your neck idea is interesting.  Ive always seen the change in design as being in regards to warp dynamics and layout not tactical considerations. As is often brought up and just because many say it doesnt mean its true that shields are the primary defense.  Any ship without shields is really a sitting duck.  All the ships we see in DS in various battles taking horrible damage or destroyed in just a few hits when there are no shields.  That is usually where I come from in my thinking.  The neck or pylons arent really weak because if you get through the shields the ship is done for anyway Defiant being a different case because it does have ablative armor but again once that is gone....I would point out that phasers can still fire even if the power would be cut to the warp core.

When Crusher unthaws the three corpsicles there isnt some wistful discussion about how of all the thousands of people who sought to preserve themselves for a better day only these three have been revived and that it might very well be so hard for them that they might come to question their decision to abandon their time and that this deed they approached with scientific zeal really had more to do with Egyptian pyramid builders than it did with a new age of reason you know actually talk about people and death. It would seem like a prime occasion to establish a line of continuity in the human story. Instead she says this bizarrely tone deaf bit about how strange it was that people in the th century were afraid of death.Like the fuck? Shes a doctor on the ship where really terrible things happen with some regularity and all her patients played out with a smile on their face? If thats the case its hard to imagine that the Enterprise is full of people at all.I think a far more defensible example of Trek passing healthy judgement is something like DSs Past Tense Sisko is appalled by the Sanctuary Districts but hes never confused by them. The avarice and shame that leads to imprisoning the neglected are things he recognizes some continuity with and he has some pathos for them even as he has no tolerance. ,DaystromInstitute,dcl9ypa,26,t5_2whek

I acknowledge that you have to suspend some disbelief to accept the premise for the conversation. However there are American shows with some threads of continuity like The Fugitive but the bigger example would be the UK series Doctor Who. Its clear that serialized science fiction television was possible over there but just wasnt yet tried in the US. And my first experiences as an American with Doctor Who were not as serials but edited into movies.  You are right though in that it wasnt until decades later that longer story arcs became more common on US television.  ,DaystromInstitute,dclsq2z,2,t5_2whek

At that point they may have put in a token effort of locating the ship and trying to recover the crew but in the end had to abandon the search.As to what might have prompted them to abandon the search this would have been in the middle of the Cardassian situation starting to heat up. On the TNG side it had been only a few months since Chain of Command and probably within a month or so of the Bajoran Coup attempt that was revealed to have been funded by the Cardassian government.

All of the battles involve two large fleets running directly into each other then twisting and maneuvering amongst each other. The opposing fleets are usually mixed together for most of the battle. All very much like a WWII fighter dogfight and nothing like a naval battleship battle. Even the way the Defiant does a strafing run looks like a WWII fighter. Phasers must have a range limit but it should be measured in hundreds of thousands of km not hundreds of meters which is the range we see in engagements.

Yes creating antimatter takes more energy than will be produced when it is used. So if it takes  units of energy to make X amount of antimatter for a starship.  When the starship uses that X amount of antimatter it will only get  units of energy back.  Here is the passagegt As used aboard the USS Enterprise antimatter is firstgenerated at major Starfleet fueling facilities by combinedsolarfusion charge reversal devices which process protonand neutron beams into antideuterons and are joined by apositron beam accelerator to produce antihydrogen specificallyantideuterium. Even with the added solar dynamo inputthere is a net energy loss of  using this process but thisloss is deemed acceptable by Starfleet to conduct distantinterstellar operations.Not that you get more energy out of antimatter than was needed to produce it.,DaystromInstitute,ddf8h2p,6,t5_2whek

10912265,0,t3_5vwhll,The Borg always had some sort of major flaw that could be exploited. It was always simple enough that youd think they would have identified and patched it. In BOBW disconnecting Locutus was enough to destroy the entire cube. It seems to me the protocol should have been to destroy the compromised drone rather than the ship. However since their local network was compromised perhaps this was to prevent the enemy from doing or learning too much from their access. Basically I see it as a defense mechanism. The hive detects a network intrusion and unable to stop it they destroy the whole ship much how the Queen destroyed ships due to a few tainted drones in the episode Unimatrix Zero. As for biological agents it seems the Borg should have had a means to detect and quarantine infected drones. Biofilters are pretty standard transporter technology and they definitely should have assimilated it by now even if the Federation was the first species they encountered with it. Theyve already shown they will destroy a whole ship because of a few bad seeds so Id imagine they wouldnt hesitate to do the same thing if they detected a highly contagious virus capable of wiping out the entire collective.The last example weve seen with Hugh and the unsolvable computer algorithm also seems like it should have safeguards in place already. Most computer systems we have today also have safeguards against infinite loops watchdog timers so Id imagine they have even better algorithms to detect it in the th Century. The issue though is I think the algorithm they were using tricks the computerhive into thinking the problem has an answer but it still seems that not running untrusted programs you download off the net is basic computer safety.Out of Universe the Borg were meant to be powerful and unstoppable by design so the only means for the Federation to defeat them was to use the Star Trek equivalent of firing proton torpedoes down the exhaust port.  Perhaps the Borg were designed by the same engineering firm that made the Death Star?Its essentially a David vs. Goliath story. The unbeatable giant has one tiny flaw if properly exploited will let the little guy win. The Federation is always resourceful and lucky so we end up with story after story where the Borg are stopped by sheer luck. Lets also not forget the Federation is known for their resourcefulness. Even the Cardassians and Dominion revered the famed Starfleet Engineers who could turn rocks into replicators. Honestly a lot of Trek episodesbattles come down to this. Think about the Battle of Chintaka. Or any number of battles where one of the crew members has an epiphany and they realize they can reprogram something most likely the deflector to exploit the weakness they just thought of?

10982799,0,t3_5wq9op,Its not hard to logic your way into exploration. For example how well did the American Indians fare when Europe arrived? Not too well. For as isolated as the native Americans were that isolation was poor defense for when outsiders decided to forcibly break into that state of isolation on their terms and not the Native Americans terms.Moreover one theory for why those Europeans were more advanced than the native americans during first contact was because of the heterogeneity of the Europeans. There were so many different cultures and societies in close proximity that they spread ideas and knowledge amongst each other and advancements by one society would quickly propagate to the other societies in contact with it advancing the whole area more quickly than in other parts of the world.Also in a political sense the concept of isolationism is an attractive one. Unfortunately just because you pretend the outside world doesnt exist that doesnt mean it actually stops existing. Maybe the Germans and Russians decide that they should team up and take America. If youre truly isolated you dont even know that a dangerous alliance is forming until its too late. Exploring expanding and establishing a frontier buffer zone gives you information and room to react. Maybe vulcans dont want andorians and Klingons to decide to gang up on Vulcan territory. The Vulcan participation in the federation cleared worked out very well for them in the prime universe at least. Arguably the doom of Vulcan in the Kelvin universe suggests that contact with other species helped bring calamity. However sooner or later the Borg threat in the gamma quadrant is going to show up in Vulcan space and if the federation had not been developed to the extent that it was then the Borg would have steamrolled Vulcan. Again the Borgs key source of power is that they are constantly exploring and gaining knowledge and power as a result. If Vulcans were shutins thatd result in certain extinction and even in the Kelvin universe the Vulcan race is better off for having been a part of the federation since it gives them a chance against existential threats like the Borg. On a more individual basis a Vulcan could conclude that a life without risk or purpose is not worth living. Call it an extension of the Socratic teaching that the unexamined life is not worth living. Vulcan philosophy would certainly find room to respect the argument put forth there.,DaystromInstitute,decv667,1,t5_2whek

11026969,0,t3_5xe3hn,As a minor point it bothers me that not too many people seem to have considered the fact that Federation Credits could be reasonably backed by Latinum.It seems like it wouldve been an easy enough handwave to write in. Rather than owning the Latinum physically a corporation Goverment run or otherwise quantifies a certain amount of Latinum to be represented in Credit form.Kind of like modern economic systems now that I think about it. I dont think that its impossible for the Federation Credit to not be backed by such a universally accepted currency as Latinum and there most certainly has to be some kind of a currency exchange of Credit and Latinum otherwise. Just because the US Dollar is banned on North Korea doesnt mean there isnt a black market for KPW to USD after all! But the fact that such a currency would otherwise be fiat in a universe where computer hacking seems exceptionally easy would seem to be a concern!EDIT Some quick research indicates USD isnt officially banned from North Korea but I certainly cant imagine its endorsed for usage by private citizens there.,DaystromInstitute,dehvrfv,1,t5_2whek
11032652,0,t1_deiilma,i think you are missing the point againyou asked why fans as defined by the context of this convo reject the new films. and the reason is because it was called prime and it wasnt prime. as such they had expectations that WOULDNT have existed if they had been honest about things from jump. similar to Discovery they have called it prime but every thing we have seen of it so far has been rather divergent. and its a problem because you are getting people hyped for something you KNOW you wont deliver. like the no mans sky debate. the individual complaints might seem petty or trivial or somehow not really at the core of what you shouldve thought you were getting but the fact is it was billed as one thing they KNEW they werent going to actually MAKE that thing and as such people were pissed because while they MIGHT have been happy with what they got if they had known it was what it was you still lied to them about its nature. i dont hate chocolate cake but if you get me hyped for icecream sundaes Im going to observe the let down.as for profits thats a poor metric in general. holly wood tends to make films people dont like because they are chasing some trend that wasnt really there see vampire genre following the more or less one off success of twilight. deciding which film you like best is entirely opinion based and of course many feel like multi part episodes because thats all a movie is in the first place i mean schindlers list is just pictures projected on a wall while audio plays. the fact remains there are plenty of trek films to use for reference if the idea is to appeal to every one. if yo are going to bill it as a film the fans will ALSO love you cant knowingly make a film that has so many issues. the fucking ship had a steam factory for an engine room are you serious? idk why this needs to be the rock you stand on for this discussion considering this is an environment for academic discussion. i repeat again you asked a factual question it received an answer. did you ask the question ONLY to get in a long conversation about opinion based points entirely tangential to your initial point?,DaystromInstitute,deiiy33,1,t5_2whek

A man who didnt want to die and literally pleaded and begged crewmembers to spare his life. Tuvix didnt ask for this he was just as an unwilling participant as Neelix and Tuvok. His only crime was apparently recognized his own self preservation and not wanting to die a fundamental right that was denied to him. gtTuvix has always struck me as a dangerous creature sociopathic even. Despite familiarity with Starfleet protocols he is not a graduate of the academy he is not a proven asset over time. This overly developed sense of self preservation at the expense of others is not a trait that is compatible to the needs of Voyager in specific and Starfleet in general.Thats why I wouldnt speak up in his defense and in fact would escort him to sickbay myself.Are these really the ideals that we should adhere to or we believe exists in the th century? That a man can be summed up by his usefulness or compatibility to a cause and if he doesnt meet a specific standard than his life can be extinguished guilt free? To seek out new life...   That is literally what Tuvix was. New life. A man with hopes desires and dreams. One of which was simply to live.

The entire point of that episode was not that Picard was right but that he was wrong! He  and Guinan as well  were allowing their personal experiences with the Borg to cloud their judgment with emotionalism and selfpity. And in doing that they were committing the same sins as the Borg. The Borg dehumanize their opponents and so was Picard. The Borg have no respect for life or individuality and neither did Picard. The Borg ruthlessly and remorselessly killed essentially entire species and Picard was getting ready to do the same thing. The situations are not the same but the arguments for wiping out the Borg were essentially the same ones used in favor of torture several years back our enemies are ruthless and evil so we have to become like them to fight them. How easy it was for both the United States and for the Federation to jettison their supposedly deep convictions because their noses had been bloodied. Picard at least had the excuse of trauma from his experiences in Best of Both Worlds to explain his actions but its disturbing to me how some Star Trek fans are willing to adopt those morally repugnant views  ones from a broken man  as their own. ,DaystromInstitute,dgt1rta,2,t5_2whek

11799043,0,t3_68b2fo,The Douwd appear to be pretty close to the Q as far as how powerful they are. Im sure the Federation does have laws against genocide and the Douwd committed this act while in Federation space. Those laws would have been written to prevent the ruler of some planet from systematically wiping out a neighboring species. Itd be at least possible to capture the person who ordered a few buttons be pushed to launch missiles then the person would be punished under the law. The Douwd simply used a single thought to kill all Husnock everywhere. Picard wasnt implying that they had no law for such a crime only that there was no precedent to sentence him. Even if he was willing to accept punishment how could anyone in the Federation determine the sentence for an immortal being?  years a million life? Life seems a bit harsh for an immortal being since the Husnock wouldnt have survived until the end of the universe anyway. So youd have to pick less how? Theres no way to confine him either since he could just leave in a few hundred years if he got bored of it.

I didnt say the Borg dont or cant have research or even develop new tech or that they dont use the scientific method. On the contrary I think they use the scientific method too much. Ill use an example A new disease crops up. There are  different standard avenues of research that could be pursued to eradicate the disease all with varying chances of success. FederationDoctorA is a Vulcan and logically pursues option  which she calculates has the highest probability of success. FederationDoctorB is a Trill and pursues option  which has the least chance of success because he was on the Holodeck and his crewmate told a joke that reminded him of something he read about once in a past life about a similar virus and he thinks that may be the key to curing this one. Which was a funny story because at the time he was a she and...FederationDoctorC is a Human and she has a dream where she is the virus and she goes around attacking her crewmates who are organs of the body until she is stopped after the shipbody makes First Contact with a new race. Once she wakes up she comes up with a completely new and novel approach based on her dream that well call option  and cures the virus. Humans are !The Borg calculate option  has the best chance of success. They devote all necessary resources to this process. It fails. They calculate option  has the next best chance of success. They devote all necessary resources to this process. It fails. They calculate options  and fail. They understand the standard solutions are insufficient and begin calculating what the next best avenue for attack is which may or may not succeed. Eventually they land on option   which was that method the Human doctor utilized. Cure achieved. To reiterate I would fully expect the Borg to follow a form of the scientific method...to a fault in that case. They were probably on method  to assimilate  when Voyager arrived they just hadnt altered their parameters from assimilate to destroy.As for the shields Id have to rewatch. Id swear they didnt have shields. As for the weapons keep in mind these ships are in space and even though they were bioships they still had to have some form of powerplant as well as structural integrity. I doubt that the nanoprobes completely destroyed every cell of the bioships...more likely they did enough damage that the bioships toreblew themselves apart due to being structurally compromised. ,DaystromInstitute,dgxia5t,7,t5_2whek
