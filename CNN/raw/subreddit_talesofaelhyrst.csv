5789416,0,t1_cxaeq0o,  Does Thumb have a last name? Not a problem if he doesnt but its fairly uncommon for humans to not have a last name so it kind of sticks out.    No one will have a Block score to start with as you are all beginning as prisoners.    Please include the reason your character is imprisoned in Alpham in the backstory on your sheet.    Smoking dragonherb? No problem. Turning it into another compound while imprisoned? Bit of a problem. Not saying you cant do it but its a lot harder to brew chemicals when you dont have limited resources and guards breathing down your neck.    Id like you to develop some characteristics about dragonherb. Its pretty obvious that its magic marijuana but Im curious about what properties you feel it should have  the idea of smoke rolling off of it from out of your pouch is a nice touch and Ive modified your Smokescreen trait accordingly.,talesofaelhyrst,cxeqcku,2,t5_3auzi
