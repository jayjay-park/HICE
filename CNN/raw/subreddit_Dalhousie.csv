1010725,0,t3_25nszg,I took philosophy.There is a lot of crossover between that and discrete maths plus it can be pretty mind opening early in your degree.FYI  I took a pretty math heavy CS degree opting for discrete math  over calc  and loved discrete.,Dalhousie,chj6ds7,2,t5_2sp8w
1228701,0,t1_ci7ufj1,Sorry let me clarify my definition of easy. Easy would denote a relatively easier program where more than exactly . of students can achieve a  grade in a first year English class. Those are official stats for English  at UBC by the way. ,Dalhousie,ci7uhpy,1,t5_2sp8w

4859311,0,t3_3hesw8,Ive got one semester left of electrical engineering and I came from an associate university.The student atmosphere at Dal sucks. This could be because Im stuck on Sexton campus but I find that there is never anything going on. Like social events and all that good shit. If there is stuff happening and I just dont know about it despite searching then the events are really poorly communicated to the engineering campus. ,Dalhousie,cu71wg1,2,t5_2sp8w

6347305,0,t3_423kjm,I would recommend attending Dalhousie straight through. I am actually in my third year of chemical engineering and I do the engineering tours here at Dalhousie. I get lots of these questions. If you attend Dalhousie the first two years some of the professors you have in your diploma years you will have in your last  years depending if you do coop. It is an advantage if you know how they mark your tests and how they lecture to take notes appropriate to each professor. I could talk on about this. Let me know if you have any specific questions.,Dalhousie,czb4981,1,t5_2sp8w
6885673,0,t1_d0wg94b,I grew up in Halifax so I might have some bias but I love it here. It is a relatively small city so if thats not your thing you should look at Toronto or Vancouver instead. Its big enough though that theres usually something to do. Lots of students come here from British Columbia and vice versa. I think Halifax and Victoria have a lot in common,Dalhousie,d0wt39d,1,t5_2sp8w

7767127,0,t1_d3o6juu,FYI this link seems to indicate that there is a different standard for probation with regards to financial assistance. It seems that as long as he got at least  of the credit hours he was registered for last semester he wont be on financial probation.,Dalhousie,d3p26zb,1,t5_2sp8w

8186684,0,t3_4rg9dx,Both first year micro and macro Econ   respectively were great courses that it was possible to do well in as long as you put the effort. It did a little bit depend on the prof so I suggest you do ask around and do a bit of research ratemyprof? before signing up. I recommend trying to take as many courses as possible with Dr Cyrus shes great.She also taught a class last year on the Economic Rise of China and India  I recommend that one as well. Its a second year Econ class sorry I forget its course number but I found it very interesting. FWIW I had no experience in Economics and my degree is something else entirely. Think I got a B in Micro and A in Macro?,Dalhousie,d50vxgj,1,t5_2sp8w

11747074,0,t3_67ky83,Im a CS student just finished my second year. DalI dont really pay anything on top of tuition although I havent really needed to use any software for any classes. TopHat is a thing that some profs use but you can use the code DalEng pretty sure thats it for a free year. Lots of textbooks that are used are free or you can find them online. I havent bought a textbook but have had courses that list textbooks just didnt want them. Lots of clubs and events from what I hear although I havent had much interest in participating. The WiFi is decent great coverage everywhere in the computer science building and everywhere else Ive been. Ive had a few problems before but not many. Cell coverage is great Im with Telus. Ive enjoyed our computer science program so far. Most professors are great with only a few to avoid pm me if you want. Some of the first year courses are super slow and dull but youre past that. Ive had a lot of fun in the courses Ive taken this year. All of the professors Ive had are super helpful and available. We have a learning center thats really helpful I actually work there as a TA and also a good work space when the building fills up. The CS building has tons of great study spots but the problem is everyone else at Dal has figured this out so it gets pretty full during midterm and exam seasons. The campus is really safe most of the south end is safe as well. I live in the south end near Dal and Ive never really had a concern walking around at night but its probably worth looking up areas to avoid. TransportationYeah Ive heard parking sucks when I had a car I always parked elsewhere and bussed in. Now I live nearby and walk. Yes most all? of the metro transit stations have free parking I used to live in Dartmouth and parked at the Woodside terminal and took the ferry over then a bus up to Dal. Not familiar with parking in Halifax but Ive heard its more difficult. ,Dalhousie,dgrk6ox,1,t5_2sp8w
