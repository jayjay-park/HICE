8399021,0,t1_d4ign1l,Add me on steam guys. DI managed to get a key and im addicted to this game on coop now.. online playing it almost every day. Already logged  hours played in DoI coop and I have over   hours played of Insurgencys elite coop mode on Brutal. Cant wait til they come out with harder modes and maps in DoI and add more weapons  attachments! D They really need to let me put a scope on an MGewehr gt.gt The  round semi auto non bolt action rifle for each side. Although I cant tell you how satisfying it is hearing the manual click and seeing the animation of each bullet going into a bolt action rifle and then sniping  dudes in a row from cover. Feels like youre prescribing them bullets.,DayofInfamy,d5rfa23,2,t5_3byav
8534652,0,t3_4we3fm,Really having a blast so far just i hope they add a few more maps even if not  completed or try outs in the near future.,DayofInfamy,d68eb5p,1,t5_3byav

11136113,0,t3_5xrm9j,The teamwork that does happen in this game from time to time wouldnt work well with hand signals. People arent focused on watching teammates and it seems like it would be pretty dangerous to do so. The action in this game is not amenable to the distraction that this would pose.,DayofInfamy,deu9mxl,1,t5_3byav

11246090,0,t3_6010py,A few thoughts What if the radio could be picked up by other classes if the radio operator died they might have to give up something... like grenades to make room to carry it.  Additionally the radio might have been damaged when the operator was killed and is rendered in operable. What if the ability to call in airartillery support gets passed down the ranks after the officer dies and only the highest ranking officer can call strikes at any time.  If the radio operator is the last person standing then the radio operator themselves can call in the strikes.,DayofInfamy,df6q77u,1,t5_3byav

11466757,0,t1_dfvqhwx,Depends on what screen youre using and how close you sit to it. I use a decently large cant remember the exact measurements p screen sitting a little over . feet about half a meter away. With this setup I think a FOV of about  is far more natural and comfortable.,DayofInfamy,dfvr0u7,1,t5_3byav
11512235,0,t3_64bdd0,seems fun! reminds me of that snow hill map in ro.i suggest to add trenches maybe  tunnels? towers for the guys on the bottom of the hill add broken accesible buildings on the right and left flank  that connects to the bottom hill? the bridge is too much imo by the looks of your early development i dont think bridge would work or even be atheistic with your current setting ,DayofInfamy,dg0wwiy,2,t5_3byav
11625441,0,t1_dgdqwb5,No I wish. The mod hasnt been updated since they pushed some recent updates to the base game which broke a lot of mods and maps.,DayofInfamy,dgdr7om,2,t5_3byav
