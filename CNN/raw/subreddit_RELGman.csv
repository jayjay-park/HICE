I started fouling because I couldnt get an armor breaks in my favor and if I didnt get some of his skill players off the pitch I was going to lose anyway. By kickoff of the nd half I had already given up but the touchback made try to go for it anyway.I didnt APO Coors light blodgeguard for a couple reasons.  it was the only the nd turn and I had no way to protect my star players already.  he was always move busted keeping him on the line  ever since he got blodge he got CAS every single game seriously like  or  get games in a row. He was cursed and Im sick of him My squad was really sunk in the last  weeks of REL. Sauce and King combined to retire  elves  deaths and I was down  blitzers for this game.
