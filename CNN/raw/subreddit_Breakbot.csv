6490077,0,t3_448mpj,So after quite a few listens Ive got a lot to say about this record considering its the successor to one of my favorite albums By Your Side.Getting this out of the way early I feel that Still Waters doesnt have anywhere near the level of accessibility of BYS and I believe it will have much less of an impact as a result.However I can say Im overall not disappointed in the slightest with this album going into it based on the singles wed already heard I did not expect to hear such pure unadulterated disco pop tracks like My Toy Too Soon and All It Takes. The introduction of Yasmin was a choice necessary to bring these poppy tracks to life in a way that Irfane couldnt replicate.For the most part I think the album flow works Arrested is a perfect track to follow up Back for More and the transition between Wet Dream and Too Soon is nice.Talking about tracks individually I think Still Waters Man Without Shadow Too Soon and Arrested standout to me as the best whilst the combination of The Sweetest Romance and GoodMe feels like a bit of a lull even though I still like the tracks. To sum up I think its a really solid record that might be playing it little too safe but it does enough to still be an enjoyable listen.,Breakbot,czqmezy,4,t5_2x0k0
