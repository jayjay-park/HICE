2096624,0,t3_2iwv21,I work in a bar close to the Collingwood cheer squad area and serve a lot of regulars. Some feral but usually polite and friendly. Wouldnt be a be a bad idea since I see quite a few people that seem to know each other through the club. ,collingwoodfc,cl6bsoo,3,t5_2tqcz
4769675,0,t3_3g84s1,GREAT game by marsh. Welcome to the big league. Poise decision making plenty of time. Good ball use and hands. Couple of errors but hell complement the back line very well. Interesting to see Langdon push up into the mid after Scharenberg came on also. Welcome back to Reid. Felt for him for that opening behind but damn if he didnt have an impact across the whole game. And welcome back to form Mr Fasolo. Pity about that Varcoe fifty. Idve bet on him Fas slotting that for his fifth. ,collingwoodfc,ctvrej8,5,t5_2tqcz

5045607,0,t1_cuu511q,Yeah really agree with how much we missed goldsack.  His kicking is really good plus his tackling and offensive pressure is really solid.,collingwoodfc,cuu6r1u,3,t5_2tqcz

7205776,0,t1_d1x2o84,Yeah I see what you mean. Reid should be the man to fill that role and I think he will as long as he stays fit. After Reid it should be Brown. ,collingwoodfc,d1x8mjd,2,t5_2tqcz
