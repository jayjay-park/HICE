Sure her abrasiveness gets her some good and offensive oneliner insults but WHY am I supposed to care one bit about this person??,WEEDS,ch012xn,1,t5_2r33i
1620204,0,t1_ci96az3,I was definitely choked up about the season  finale but otherwise yeah very little investment in anyone.I only care about Nancy because of Shane and Andy at this point. When she decided to get back into the drug business after burning down Agrestic I already though she was a selfish bitch and that it would take something really huge to redeem her. When she decided to have the DEA guy killed instead of the thug that did it for me. Her only value to me is that she is loved by her childrenAndy.Yeah Dougs character stopped being entertaining when it was clear that they were going to take it to an extreme and never give him a flash of redeeming character. How could you be on the city council and be the kind of backroom deals and a shady CPA yet not be able to hold your shit together to run a business for a few months or to not fuck up when your life depends on it? Just not realistic.,WEEDS,cjje4yy,2,t5_2r33i
