5378269,0,t3_3omy8r,Thank you for this. The immediate impression is that I am off staying with Lastpass at least for the time being. As you I use my phone a lot for passwords during the day and I rely heavily on the S fingerprint sensor. No fun entering a long passphrase many times each day. And Lastpass has secure form fill profiles as well. Thank you. ,Lastpass,cvz4ugv,2,t5_2yuk0
