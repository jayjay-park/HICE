7761981,0,t1_d3i7ohl,Thank you for your comment Much appreciated. Ive been trying to stay positive by reading inspirational quotes to get through day by day to keep my mind off these toxic people Luckily we have a garage to safely park our car inside at night and added security cameras after some magically cigarette butts landed on our driveway. Once someone disrespects me they no longer exist to me. I dont tolerate bullshit and just try to move on. However I suspect we have neighbours who are trying to sabotage our from home selling. When we do home renovations outdoor they would coincidentally walk by just to mock how ugly our house look. Ideally we ignore their words and continue doing our work. To make matters worse we live in between them and their inlaw family house with their kids playing on our driveway in the past. That issue has stop ever since we got security camera installed around our home.Im aware they have been not so secretly recording our vehicle backup alarm when it automatically activates when it is shift into reverse because they started taking pictures of us while we were installing our security cameras outdoor. In addition they would have their inlaw family car intentionally block our car from easily reversing out of our driveway once in awhile so someone inside of their home could record the backup alarm noise activate for a longer period of time to collect video noise evidence coming from our vehicle instead of moving their car out of the way.People try to sue over almost anything nowadays no matter how ridiculous it is. Ive read an article about someone suing their neighbour for hanging up WIND CHIMES to Starbucks sued for  million for putting too much ice in its iced drinks by a Chicago woman. If it was deemed too loud we believe some kind of official authority would of said something earlier to us if they measured the decibel dB.Hopefully everything will be alright in the end because I dont want to meet these people in court for this type of nonsense.
