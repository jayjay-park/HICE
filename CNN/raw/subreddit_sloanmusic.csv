9318322,0,t3_582dev,Man I miss going down to NYC for Sloan shows. As a Canadian who is lucky some years to see them during the summer festival circut shows in the US are pleasently smaller dont cater to the radio crowds and usually have a crowd of hardcore fans. Hopefully in the next few years Ill head back down. Ive met some awesome people along the way I havent seen in ages. ,sloanmusic,d8x5yrt,1,t5_3187y
