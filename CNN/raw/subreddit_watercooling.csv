149540,0,t3_1vsulr,uBartimaeus is your man for Australia based stuff as pricing and whatnot differs greatly depending on where you order from etc..Your best bet is to head over to a watercooling parts stockist like  and just browse the various parts listed there.  To give you a head start the following brands are good safe bets EK Aquacomputer XSPC Bitspower Alphacool and Watercool theyre behind the heatkiller blocks.  There are others but the ones I listed are probably the best supported and stocked plus theyre harder to go wrong with for instance Phobya has some very good products but also some rather questionable ones.  For a pump the Laing D Vario is a very solid option.  There are a lot of aftermarket parts pump tops mod kits etc. for them and theyre typically very reliable and run pretty quietly.  You may also see the same pump listed under the name MCP Vario.   These pumps are sold under both the Laing name and by other OEMs like with GPUs Swiftech is a good option here in addition to the ones I listed above but they get a bit iffy on the warranty front regarding changing the pump tops now.Reservoir tip try to avoid bay reservoirs.  Theyre typically louder harder to fill and to drain.  A good tube reservoir plus a pump or even a tube reservoirpump combo theyll have it labelled as such if it is one is your best bet here.Basically go for the parts that you think look great and that suit what youre happy to spend watercooling gets pretty expensive fast.  When youve built up a potential list well go over it to check for any inconsistencies etc.  If youve made any mistakes or arent sure about a particular component then well do out best to help out.Oh and try out the EK cooling configurator in the sidebar under resources for helping to choose a GPU block.  Its not strictly necessary as youre buying everything from scratch though.  Just remember to go for a reference design card and not one of the custom models with a fancy cooler else you can almost guarantee that no full cover block will fit.Hope that helps,watercooling,cevgoz5,3,t5_2r01v

You are going to want a lot better fans than the ones you have chosen. I would start by looking at NoiseBlocker or Noctua. Ditch the Hi and do a full CPURAMGPU loop. Dont get a Blackwidow Keyboard! I recommmend a Ducky or at least a Corsair head on over to rMechanicalKeyboards to see some good ones and to get advice for your needs. I personally have a HHKB for typing and a Cherry MX Brown for Gaming.Unless you really think you need it or if you really just want it I would get the K instead of the X. I personally dont find the Extreme Editions worth double so I have a KAnd like the guy below me said you could get the EVGA HydroCopper Tis but I personally love EK Waterblocks so that is what I am going to use on mine when I upgrade.Two last things that power supply you listed is Out of Stock everywhere so I would look at either the LEPA W or the Corsair AXi in the near future. And with those power supplies look into custom cabling at And as I said before. Get a CaseLabs Case.

Thats a rough increase of  more volume!gtWhilst I dont have my thermal testing results anymore I can definitely confirm that the cards were not running anything like C I also wasnt running my fans even close to kRPM was using pushpull mind but at RPM or so.GPU deltas have been lower than CPU deltas in my experience I suspect due the heat being spread over the larger cores so I suspect C could have been attainable for your system even with so much GPU wattage.Yknow I dont actually disagree with you that its technically possible to run the system on one mm radiator and I know you had a massive caveat in your post but I just feel it should be a bit more clear cut for beginners in if it will work or not.

Are you using some extensions?Yeah having it blow hot air outside at the back makes sense.Im no expert but I will pass along some advice that Ive received. . Regarding your parts you might want to switch to Mayhems X Coolant Concentrate instead of EKs amp you should go with PrimoChill PrimoFlex Advanced LRT Tubing instead of Tygon. Everything else looks good.. RAM cooling is generally not required unless youve overclocked your memory amp the default heatsinks are lowprofile or something. You can leave it to be cooled passively.. The same goes for the motherboard you can leave it to being passively cooled unles youre doing some heavy overclocking.. You were asking for fans blowing over your pump? I dont think thats required either.. As for the HDD I dont know how hot yours runs. I have mine in a Phantom  amp I have the intake  mm fan cooling the drive cages amp I get about C on my HDDs. I guess they would be hotter if they were just passively cooled. So you might want to have a fan that blows air over your HDD so it stays cool.. Also since you dont have any space restrictions with regards to radiator space you can think about getting a thicker radiator or even multiple radiators so you can run your fans at lower speeds. You dont seem to have any fans in either your FrozenCPU list nor your PCPartPickerList eitherHope this gives some pointers!,watercooling,chyns8u,1,t5_2r01v

1469274,0,t3_2b015a,Fans are going to play the biggest part here  a slim mm can handle that heat load fine with medium or high speed fans but dont expect to run some rpm silent setup. When you add the second rad go with a mm its noticeably more surface area and will give you more cooling power letting you run the original fans slower or replace them with something slower if you lack fan control.Yate Loon high speeds are dirt cheap and will easily handle this for a temporary solution but you probably wont like the volume. Its a LOT deeper than the vacuum sound the x makes though which makes it more bearable. You could try some yate loon mediums instead again theyre dirt cheap and you can replace them with quality fans when you finalize your loop.An example eesh edits X  .ghz  core   thread mosfet cooler plus x gtxs in a single loop MCPX and a truly ancient Black Ice mm thick radiator with x yate loon high speeds has zero problems even under heavy use of all  components.

Clear versions will still cloud but wont leech plasticizer and clog. You might want to look into getting barbs and zip ties if you really want to save money. Pretty much any metal fitting in the right size is secure if you install it properly.

However the corsair software is open source and allows users full access to the keyboards full capabilities. Of course due to its less user friendly nature its more inaccessible in a sense to the computer illiterate. Do you feel as if you can type on the Kailh switches without bottoming out? The activation mechanism is different and in my usage of it I found that it was near impossible to type without bottoming out whereas I can do it consistently with Cherry MX switches. I had an older BW non chroma the keycaps faded too readily and a couple of the keys stopped functioning entirely. Given that some of the keys were less commonly used keys such as the right side shift button I dont think they got even a million clicks out of them. Much less the  million click lifespan theyre advertised. The board seemed durable but I never even got more than a year out of it as the microusb connector eventually failed.I cant vouch for anything regarding their newer be chroma lineup.

2937799,0,t3_2ts0sv,Tygon E tubing was not meant for watercooling and leaches out residue that can eventually gunk up your blocks. You should swap to a plasticizer free tubing such as primochill advanced LRT. Theres nothing fundamentally wrong with   sized tubing provided you have a strong enough pump a D is perfectly fine in this setup. But the tubing is going to look puny and anorexic in anything larger than MiniITX its the smallest available size in what seems to be a midtower case. Theres going to be a major mismatch in aesthetics. Id recommend you go for a larger OD plus a thicker tubing wall as thicker tubing is harder to kink and can take tighter bends. I feel that  ID  OD tubing is the sweetspot for popularity compatibility flexibility and usability.Seems strange to invest so much in watercooling gear and just get a basic pump. A custom pump top like by EK or bitspower will improve the flowrate and reduce the noise of the pump. You should also opt for a variable speed D rather than a normal one. being able to vary the speed and power of the pump is very useful for filling and bleeding a loop. On top of that you can turn down the speeds to reduce noise as sometimes your pump vibrations resonate at just the right frequencies with the steel walls of your case causing your case to just become this giant noisebox. I would definitely recommend a D vario or variable speed nonpwn version of the pump.If youre a firsttimer I would definitely recommend you use distilled water its cheaper easier to replace and nonconductive and nonstaining to boot. You can get it for a couple bucks from your local market youll need to anyways as you need to flush your components with distilled water to rinse dust and leftover metalsolderpaint bits from the factory. Distilled water is a lot more forgiving as all colored coolants are conductive. So in a situation say where youve discovered youve got a leak dripping onto your expensive pc components youll be much better off if you were using distilled water. Biocides and anticorrosives are unnecessary in a properly prepared loop but theres nothing wrong with throwing in a killcoil or mild biocide as a justincase option. You should at the very least practice filling your loop with distilled water before later swapping it out for colored coolant.Youve also ordered a way drain valve and a drain valve but no plugs. Youll probably want a few of those otherwise youll have these open ports in your system.It looks like you have two GPUs in SLIcrossfire did you know they make special connectors for those? They link up your GPUs so you dont need to buy extra tubing and fittings. I dont know what motherboard spacing youve got so I cant recommend anything.

Additionally the VRMs on a motherboard are relatively largespread out compared to the VRMs crammed onto a graphics card and they usually have their own heatsinks to begin with.I think VRM heatfailure is really just an issue on AMD FX CPUs because these are in the unusual situation where a CPU FX drawing  watts can be physically installed and used in a motherboard that was never designed to handle it. In addition to those CPUs drawing an unusually high amount of power in the first place you dont see those kinds of compatibility issues with the current Intel lineup...

Itll  clogged up your CPU block and youd have to constantly tear it down to clean and replace tubing after a few months.Whats the point of saving shipping if you have to tear down the loop clean it and replace the tubing  months down the road? Youll spend more time and money in the long run. Ive ran the promo chill tubing  years without cleaningflushing the loop once and ZERO leech happened.

8367001,0,t3_4u7991,The fact therere two offshoots is a little mystifying a single would mostassuredly indicate a bleed point for the tubing especially at the bottom.It could be that the one near the res itself is actually on a rotatable fitting and could therefore be lifted to a horizontal angle and used as a means of blowing on the tube to eject whatever liquids still there after doing a normal bleed. Entirely speculative though. I dont know the specific fittings well enough to make claims.And all ends need to be plugged but for presumable bleeding endpoints a valve fitting works wonders.,watercooling,d5nfcpd,1,t5_2r01v
8370661,0,t3_4u9bbf,I bought a  pack of the  tubing.  It depends a lot on your case how many rads blocks and ress you have.  Example being Im using my Corsair Obsidian d with a res gpu  rad up top cpu block  rad in front to res. I have redone it  times and I think I have  to  sticks left of the full tubing so I used about  tubes each time.  I have a large case but there are larger.  I would say if you go with a smaller case you could do the full thing with  as long as you take your time and make sure your bends and runs are accurate.  If this is your first time you may want to do a  pack and another  pack for the extra  or  you may need just in case you need a tube more. If you dont mind a little more the  pack was a bargain for me and I can go back an redo everything if I ever wanted to.edit Also for some good info the primochill bending rod kinda sucks.

9113164,0,t3_552zfg,No sense water cooling the GPU very little reason to water cool the CPU either. Honestly the best bang for your buck to get a dead silent system is to rip out the Sideon put in a Noctua NHDS replace the stock fans and get an EVGA W G with the eco mode on so the fan turns off and will basically stay off.Lastly I would remove the middle unused drive cage to reduce any airflow restrictions and make sure all fans can be PWM controlled so during idleminimal workloads you can have them running at very very low RPM.Now if you want to turn this into a watercooled rig you can I just wouldnt considering the hardware. Basic loop cost is going to be around  at the low end if you include the GPU. It also probably wont be quieter than the air cooled approach under load unless you spring for a second radiator.,watercooling,d8796zz,2,t5_2r01v

Im fond of doing a quick clean in the sink and rinsing with distilled water then doing a full system flush with one of the many products out there.  Then a drain and flush with distilled water then final refill and bleeding with the desired fluid.  It will add a day or two to the assembly but it also almost guarantees you will find any leaks get to test and possibly improve your fillingdraining setups and wont have to tear into again till its time to do the biannual maintenance.  ,watercooling,d9ocftd,1,t5_2r01v

It also takes talent to actually pull off something like that.Why does a PC have to be purely functional? Yes with energy efficiency on my k and  being so good I do not need to watercool. But I want to for reasons summed up in your picture.It will be unique  your build will be something you disassembled and made rather than a generic copy you see  times over on rpcmr everyday. It would be totally silent and a perfect demonstration of how function meets art in a way. Computers dont just have to be big boxes of boring steel. Old PCs used to be like that  why does it matter if a motherboard is green and the case a white box? It doesnt change performance. We now see RBG LED and tempered glass everywhere. The same thing will happen to a greater and greater extent  PCs will not be some ugly massive box to be hidden under a desk only consoles left to be seen. Aesthetics is becoming more and more important.Put it this way  not many people will understand granted but for those that do its something really impressive. If you posted another boring ass build of a air cooler like you see on PCMR everyday I wouldnt even open the thread. Ones like this though are impressive and in a different league.

Place the top panel on its clips undo the crews remove top panel place it on the top without fully depressing. If still using top rad bracket COMPLETELY seal off ANY open space with some black tape. This prevents hot air from recirculating back into the main chamber. . Increase the front vent area by buying longer screws for the front panel mounts. You only need about .cm of extra length. Final result should make the front panel flush with other panels.. Fan orientation should be FrontIntake TopExhaust RearIntake. The last one is what people mess up. A rear  will feed fresh air into your top mm rad and keep your case at positive pressure.. Dont buy crap fans.
