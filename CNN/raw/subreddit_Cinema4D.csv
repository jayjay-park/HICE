169226,0,t3_1w06ye,Vray is quite powerful once you learn how to use it properly. Not understanding and learning it well results in horrible renders with horrible render times. Going from CD to vray renderer is a pain. I suggest if you will use vray at some point just start using it from the beginning of the project.Physical gets the job done but its quite a bit slower with less customization options for how it renders.,Cinema4D,cexpi13,2,t5_2roi3

262415,0,t3_1x2t00,Well first of all Id start out with a cloner object with a multi shader to create the multiple cars and use a plain effector to move them. Maybe a spline effector would also work.That saves a lot of key framing and gives you a bit more freedom to play around.If the looping doesnt turn out great with the multi shader you could always put multiple cars in the cloner and give them colors by hand.Looping is always kinda tricky and needs some tinkering to get right. So its always a good thing to make playing around easy as possible.  Good luck!,Cinema4D,cf7yic8,1,t5_2roi3

283265,0,t1_cfa3wjc,For a first project this looks really good! Regarding the cams try to tweak the paths it follows. Perhaps keying the cams instead of morphing gives you more control. The handling of the splines in your timeline may be a bit daunting in the beginning but once youve got the hang of it youll have much more control over them. When ypu start in a shot give the camera a faster movement. CD automatically puts in a soft ease which is usually fine but with cameras its often nicer to have a more constant movement.The comping might need a little bit of attention here and there but yeah for a first project it really is pretty good!

431843,0,t3_1z0dfr,looking good for starts. definitely agree with the flat lighting looks like theres only one light source. one easy trick to really make the lighting pop is to use a  point lighting system. make a target light copy the light  times  leaving only one target. position the target item on or around the pillows then move the lights around the scene until you get some nice dynamics of shadows. you can also try slightly tinting each light a different color. another couple things to play with to get some more variation into the models would be to add a displacement deformer with a very subtle noise shader. Or get right in there with the magnet tool and push and pull the mesh to give it some added lumpiness. Also you could find a good high res texture of fabric and add it to the bump channel of your material with a very low height. This will give the material a very subtle ridged or sewn texture. ,Cinema4D,cfpix7s,2,t5_2roi3

1040866,0,t3_260b8r,Well its a first render. It obviously needs a lot of work in just about every way but you already know that so I dont think telling you everything that needs to be worked on would be terribly productive.Instead since youre just starting out Ill offer you some advice that or some rules of thumb that Ive picked up along the way. There isnt any one thing that makes a great looking scene. Its a combination of composition textures lighting modeling and imperfections. Perfectly smooth surfaces and edges made of perfect degree angles do not exist anywhere in the real world. Try to soften up every hard edge in your scenes whether its beveling edges on polys or chamfers on the curves of your splines. Even seemingly smooth surfaces like table tops and shiny plastic things have a texture to them. Try to use some method of mapping on your surfaces whether its bump mapping displacement mapping or normal mapping. Every surface has its own its feel this is where good texturing comes in. Perfect black and white really arent found anywhere in the real world either. Avoid using them when trying to achieve realism. Pay close attention to scale. Learn to use global illumination and ambient occlusion. These two settings will increase render times but you get much better renders because with them. I do this one a lot and may be alone here  When youre out and about during your day look at certain objects and think how you might model it. Which techniques would you use how would you change it if you could? These are fun little mental exercises that keep your head in the game when youre away from CD. Never reach a comfort zone. No matter how good you are you can always be a lot better.Keep with it though. D modeling isnt something youre going to get good at over night. But with every scene or every model. Make sure youre constantly going the extra mile. Dont rush an object or a scene just to show it off. Spend more time adding detail. ,Cinema4D,chmln4b,3,t5_2roi3
1042318,0,t1_chmqu7n,Thank you I have taken your advice and created an outline. However this has not helped. here is an updated version of the scene,Cinema4D,chmrl8k,1,t5_2roi3
1198604,0,t1_ci1qkb7,I can try to explain but I dunno if Ill be any good at it  Think of it like a cube. in D a cube has  sides.... now.... if you unfolded your cube you get a cross... like this .....thats unwrappingOr Think of it like a map of the earth. The map you usually see is flat. its the equivalent of if you took the round earth cut it down one side and peeled the map off the sphere and flattened it out. UV mapping in D is sort of the same idea. textures are flat. D geometry is not. Sometimes you want to have your flat texture map to your D geometry in a very particular way.... like on a lowpolycount face like for a game for example. You dont need to necessarily model all the features but you can put  like.... stubble for example.... as part of the flat texture. but then you need that stubble to go precicely on the chin of your mesh. to do that you need to unfold the mesh.... so you know exactly where your stubble needs to go relative to the rest of the face on the flat texture. Now when you apply your texture back to your mesh everything is in the right place. its a fairly advanced texturing technique. But seriously just watch the first video in Jamie HamelSmiths UV mapping series. He explains it way better and with visual aids!  ,Cinema4D,ci4gma5,2,t5_2roi3

2131887,0,t3_2jc9qy,There are many things that you should account for with motion tracking...Lens distortion  there are many tutorials on this since I use pftrack its very easy to compensate for lens distortion I dont know about Boujou. You can also film a checkerboard with the same cameralens to find out how much optical distortion there is then run the footage through AE using an effect to compensation for optical distortion using the checkerboard that you shot as lens distortion reference.Motion blurRolling shutter  Footage with noticeable motion blur or rolling shutter will be MUCH more difficult to track.Camera details   find out all of the information you can about your cameralens and fill in the metadata in your tracking program such as... Film back focal length lens size etc.NoiseCompression  worry about noise with higher quality K footage where small amounts of noise or grain can actually offset the tracking marker. Make sure that you never compress your footage before tracking.User tracks  create custom hand keyed user tracks to help guide the automatic tracking. With a bad track like this one it would help the shot a lot. It would also be easy to do on this shot due to the points where the squares on the blanket meet.Frame rate  footage with higher frame rates is easier to track. Also make sure that you set your motion tracking project to the same frame rate as the footage.Grading  to help with a tricky shot you can run the footage through AE before tracking with some effects like upping the contrast to help create more visible points for the program to track.ReflectionsMoving objects   there arent any in this scene but any reflections or moving objects should be rotod out in your tracking program as they can mess up a motion track.Hope this helps!,Cinema4D,clat5sv,2,t5_2roi3

2603750,0,t3_2pnyza,My first issue that Im seeing here is that you have WAY too many polygons.  Hypernurbs exist to reduce how many you have to work with.  Im guessing you used a spline you built in another program then extruded it to make this?  Dont make it in CD and build it with the linear spline if you choose to do it that way I built mine with a  sided polygo and extruded edges to build the one I gave you it makes it easier to make sure point have partners to connect with.  Focus on being a simple to start with as you can you dont need to spell out the curves with lots of points use as few points as you can to get the curve you want.  Next dont worry about the triangle thing too much.  Sometimes the odd triangle will be necessary or even helpful and if you dont see it messing up your geometry then no harm done you can see  big ones at work on mine.  Triangles really only become an issue when youre trying to create some kind of radial geometry they result in dead ends or you have too many of them bunching up in one place which can get ugly.Here is mine which I built off the shape of yours I dont know that its perfectly what you want to do but I think it should point you in the right direction.

2612324,0,t3_2ps4au,What a cute little room! Nice palette but Id turn down the overlaid texture a little. Great table texture I wish the other wood surfaces would have a little of that. The Pikachu texture seems to be slightly squished horizontally? Maybe add a few more items to give it more personality like a lamp on the bedside table or a few toys. The chair seems to be too low to sit on but maybe its just the perspective. Are you working with real life measurements?Some edges like the bed sheets are heavily beveled which doesnt work too well with the broken phong shading in the pillow in my opinion. One looks very low the other very high poly. I actually prefer the look of the sheets.Im a bit confused about the lighting.

3176844,0,t3_2wg55j,Im assuming you used the mograph effectors? You may want to try and work on your falloff settings. Also you may want to try and use some delay effectors or tweak if you are. The settling of the pieces is very abrupt and linear.Also your camera has some bumps and drifts. There are a few things you can do to alleviate this. You can use camera targets. They are def your friend. You could animate the camera along a pathsplineshape in conjunction with the target if youd like. The motion camera has some great features allowing you to blend between paths and add convincing camera shakesettling.I also noticed some funky edges in the circle cutouts. Im not sure how you modeled that but it could be done with spline masks and extrusions or even with a boole.All in all not bad for a first time. Further along than I was when I first started out. Keep it up and do some googling on some of the things I touched on above they should help.As neoblade suggested below x the speed. I wouldnt go down that route.

You could try using a compositing tag and tell everything in the scene not to be seen by reflection then you could throw a map into the Environment slot for each material.  If you dont want to do that you could try to bake your reflections.Be sure to check Use Camera Vector in the Bake Texture tag. You cant exactly map reflections though Id use a layer shader in the color of the material and experiment. Layer your mapped reflection on top of the color or texture you were using for the material. Id try overlay and play around until you get something that looks close.,Cinema4D,cw0m8ud,1,t5_2roi3

5500952,0,t3_3qfufj,The power of Octane is in the DirectLighting kernel think of it as a rendering mode. It doesnt treat light properly to the trained eye in some specific cases  but is likely unnoticeable for your purposes and is extremely quick to render on GPU. PMC and Pathtracing kernels are appropriately unbiased pathtracing approaches which see loosely the same render power per dollar as unbiased montecarlo pathtracers Arnold PRman for example on cpu.Considering that Octane requires you to load your full scene onto the GPU Vram in your case mb  you probably wont have a lot of success with anything beyond a relatively simple scene. As well  when people use Octane they tend to exploit the price point of GPU cost multiplied against the speed at which the DirectLighting kernel will render.The shader models are quite easy to pick up and are more closely related to other render engines than cinemads shaders. Cd has taken some steps to reaching similar models  but is still highly a niche of its own. By learning octanes shader scheme you are opening yourself to other render engines shader models.I use both Octane and Arnold  as well sometimes cd standard and physical  all with successful results. Unfortunately there is no easy answer. However  I am always a promoter of learning new tools!,Cinema4D,cwesqzi,6,t5_2roi3

5925995,0,t1_cxvy2yi,I am sorry I meant no harm or offense by my comment. However I am still convinced the material OP references is refraction based on the following evidenceRefractive qualities    CD Material Transparency refraction . blurry  CD Material  SSS radius CD Material  SSS radius CD Material  SSS radius As well here is a quickie of the same refraction technique in a  second Octane shaderSubsurface Scattering  in my opinion is incorrect because it does not refract. In the real world concrete and glass are both made of particles that receive a photon and have to decide what they do with it based on their qualities. D rendering is a cheat I am saying that Subsurface Scattering is the wrong cheat to achieve the effect shown specifically in OPs reference. It may not be the fastest cheat but OP did not ask what is the fastest way to achieve something close to this effect. There certainly are ways to achieve a very pretty however fairly different result using other methods.I am a promoter of plain speaking and open civil dialogue for the sake of learning  once again I mean no offence in what Ive suggested.

Something around that but that just affects the final look not the speed of the flow. With my above settings during the simulation stage the particles just stop and orbit around one of the noise fields along the circuit instead of exiting.

I also dont think you want to put the time effectors under the fracture object.

I have  machines and if at any point im rendering on them I just work with the watermark on my workstation.If youre in a superpinch you techincally could go as far as not purchasing a license and work with watermark  and simply do your render on pixel plow or rebus.Personally I dont mind paying a premium for good software. At the end of the day I want the tool that is stable reliable and packed with features that help me get out of a jam on a job.,Cinema4D,d8xc1us,1,t5_2roi3

10361739,0,t1_dcij664,I would call those green. Doesnt look too bad. I would look into adding light to your scene next. It looks like you use default light only which comes straight from the front and doesnt cast any shadows its just for testing really.You can add a sky object to your scene add a HDRI texture to it via Material gt Luminance and then enable Global Illumination in the render settings for instant effect. You can find some HDRI files in the CD content browser just search for HDRI. Alternatively add some light objects manually and set them up until everything is light properly as you want.You definitely will have to spend some time with that to make things look good. Theres no one single Instant Magic button to solve this sadly. For your materials you could add a Subsurface Scattering shader to the Luminance channel and enable some reflection with a Fesnel via the Reflectance channel to give it a better pop with slower render times of course  ,Cinema4D,dcikbla,1,t5_2roi3

10370453,0,t3_5odso0,Hate to sound like a broken record but yes dont bother with videos. Just render out a png image sequence and youre good to go. If you want to do a lot of colour correction out but in  bits. I use movie files only when Im doing quick renders and tests and want to see how everything looks and on final output just export image sequences. ,Cinema4D,dcjjwus,3,t5_2roi3
10465863,0,t1_dcud981,If Im not mistaken the reason it does this is because you can rerender frame sequences over top of old ones. Especially if youre using Team Render Server. Because you can do that theres no way for TRS to know whats finished and whats not... for example if youve rendered a  sequence but want to replace  you just replace the cd file in TRS with a new save and press render. youre telling it to rerender the sequence over top of an old one. I dont know how backburner would handle that  it would be equally frustrating if you were trying to rerender a few frames  and the only way to do it would be to go into the folder and manually delete the frames or make an entirely new folder just for those frames. and hey nothin is gonna be the best at everything. for some things Max is just gonna be better. Same vice versa.... thats just software man. shrugs But uLazores is right  if you use the render queue you can set it to render the frame ranges you want. it may just prompt you to save each one as a separate cd file which isnt the end of the world. Also If Im not mistaken You should also be able to use the take system in conjunction with render setting children if you dont want to save each sequence to a new file. You pair each new take with a corresponding render setting child that has the ranges you want..... Then you just tell it to render all takes and itll go through the list. Im pretty sure Ive done this before. Probably a bit more setup though.  ,Cinema4D,dcueui6,1,t5_2roi3

11446319,0,t3_63ek3x,Hi everyone  Im going travelling fulltime in a few months to visit all  countries so this is a long term solution Im looking for. I have spent the past year reducing my belongings and now live out of a L backpack so Im on a search for the best travel laptop. Money isnt really that big of a deal as I plan to keep the laptop for at least  years whilst travelling. I mainly work in After Effects and Cinema D. You can see my work here www.tierney.tv if this helps with my laptop needs. I did buy the MSI GTVR RE Dominator Pro K but it was way to heavy for travelling and it was only a rd faster rendering the same file in CD then what Im currently working on so I sent it back. I currently work on a MSi Notbook PC MSGDIntel Core iMQ CPU  .GHz  GB RamNVIDIA GeForce GT MTB SSD Im not in a huge rush to get a new laptop. I would rather spend the time researching and getting peoples ideas and opinions first. So to summarise I want a laptop that is . Lightweight around KG definitely under KG. Renders CD files faster than my current laptop. Budget  around  GBP can be pushed higher if its worth it ThanksMichael ,Cinema4D,dftfhxm,1,t5_2roi3
