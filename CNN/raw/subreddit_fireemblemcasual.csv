I never said the drama was necessary.Third there are no sides here theres no point in acting like if they were. Doing so only fractionates the subreddit which is something that doesnt help at all.And finally you cant shield someone by saying he is just saying the truth to prevent misunderstandings. Saying the truth does not mean you can not be an asshole and while I dont have anything against Chast saying that there is someone you cant stand in the subreddit and then even asking if we guessed who as if we needed more drama and stating that you are cleaning the house when asked why he deleted skype contacts is just being a drama queen. If you are going to leave fine do a statement and delete those people you dont want to keep talking to. But trying to create drama over it is totally unneccesary.,fireemblemcasual,cmpo54k,1,t5_342g7

Youve experienced a great deal of tragedy and pain in such a short while. Youve lost so many people and been betrayed by those you thought were on your side. I cannot even begin to fathom how that must feel.But if this subreddit is testament to anything I believe great things can happen if you just keep going even against the odds. Some days may not seem worth the effort but there are always those days that make life worth living.Im not saying to forgive what happened in the past or even to accept it. Pain isnt erased or forgotten by the mind so easily. Instead just keep going. There will be days where nothing seems worth it but remember that there are so many of us here and other places who will be there to catch you when you stumble. And of course there will be plenty of days where life is worth living.And well be here to help you if you trip and fall.

3063950,0,t3_2v73wl,Gotta go with Phantasy Star IV on Genesis. Fantastic RPG thats extremely easy to return to. Along with the extremely useful Macro system which allowed the player to set when each character would perform their action In numerous other games its entirely possible for the speed order to be broken via RNG so having more stability is definitely nice PS also had these really cool combo spellstechniques akin to Chrono Trigger. Unlike Chrono Trigger though the game has coolunique names for these combo spells seriously its hard for Fire Punch and Double Cure to compare to the likes of Holocaust and Grand Cross and while there are admittedly much fewer of these techs they are far more useful IMO.Not to mention the beautiful attack animations. Even the more mundaneweak spells have pretty cool animations that make it feel like your partys actually dishing out damage. Then you have techs separate from spells they dont use the MP bar but have a limited number of uses which are unique to each character and can perform a wide variety of actions. These can also be used in the abovementioned combo moves and generally look cool regardless. The storys pretty good and will certainly keep you interested outside of maybe one or two parts I never felt like the game was really dragging or stalling. The pacing is great and still manages to keep sidequests in mind which I can certainly appreciate. Its at least standard length for an RPG if not longer and the characters are easily likeable.The musics fairly memorable though admittedly there are games with better overall soundtracks. Not the greatest aspect of the game but not bad either Id say its at least above average.Lastly though Im probably skipping quite a bit about this game the enemies themselves have this neat fantasyscifi design thats really visually appealing. The designs can range from extremely soft and lighthearted to somewhat dark and grim and yet none of them feel particularly outofplace in their given setting. They look amazing and I love how welldesigned they are.So yeah if youre a fan of oldschool RPGs this is definitely a game you should check out. Its surprising how little its talked about considering how great it is.,fireemblemcasual,cofkqa6,1,t5_342g7

The only concern is that I might also have bipolar disorder so Im meeting with a psychologist next week to find out and start treatment Chest pain got so bad that I couldnt even bend over last night and was having trouble breathing and speaking. I also had a violent cough that would take all of the little oxygen that I had out of my lungs Suicidal plans Didnt go through with it and they have passed now Left the sub and missed talking to everybody Having trouble concentrating on one thing at a timeWhat I did differently Actually went to get help Took some time to worry about myself Got into contact with old friends that I havent spoken to in a little over a year Cleaned up my facebook friends list to only people that I talk to in order to try to feel more comfortable posting there Opened up to my friends and roommates completely about everything that Id been going throughSpecial QuestionHonestly I look up to everybody.

3649406,0,t3_3264ao,Today was great. I was awake and alert all day little drowsiness.    Started two new saves for Bloodborne. One is just a general replay. The other is a Castlevania style challenge playthrough. No guns whip only final destination.    I also tried to do some coop in Bloodborne. When it didnt find anyone to connect to I decided to try a small experiment and see how long it would take to find someone. It took two hours to find one person. And that was after I set connection options to Worldwide instead of Local Only which meant the game was so laggy that the boss we fought didnt even animate.    Seriously that is not hyperbole. Two hours. Thats  repeats of Deadly Premonitions Whistle Theme which I was listening to during the experiment.    . Would not coop again From Software.    In good news though I did have my first fencing lesson in three weeks. Rusty as heck.    EDIT TWO HOURSQuake,fireemblemcasual,cq89ch7,2,t5_342g7

After navigating through some confusing caves I hapened to meet these two They had a kickass theme and I got really excited from facing them. Then I had to face the gatekeeper so to speak. Those two fights went reasonably well. My puppets were a bit higher level than theirs so everything was good. Then I finally entered Makai and after healing and buying stuff I headed straight for the Pandaemonium This is the equivalent of the Pokemon League.Facing the first one Yuki already pretty challenging but I beat herNext up was Mai I also beat her but most of my team was wiped out. Good thing I brought revives!Afterwards I beat Yumeko the third one but forgot to take screenshots oops! It was a really close fight!Up last was the th the final one of the Makai Elite Shinka the one who created the puppets! She was pretty intimidating and she came with a badass theme! The background was really cool too!After losing one time I retried and made a really close finish! Thanks uKyroOryk!That was it! I resolved the incident.

Kumagawa was the best!Then I watched A Boring World Where the Concept of Dirty Jokes Does not exist what a name. Pretty funny will be following it but nothing special so far.New episode of Gangsta too read the manga though so nothing to discuss there really. Then I watched Gakkou Gurashi!. Damn thats all Im gonna say.After that me and a friend wanted to watch funny stuff. We relished Assholekun from Charlotte. Great fun so far.Then I checked out the Prison School adaptation. It was everything I had hoped for and more except the white beams. I think uFaZeBoOtY can agree that Hanachan is best girl.Also checked out Gate. Expected something similiar to Outbreak Company but was pleasantly surprised with actual politics and military fucking up medieval armies.To finish my day I watched the new episode of Summer Days Dream and finally watched episode  of Memories of Phantasm. Great day all around.,fireemblemcasual,csz5w3l,2,t5_342g7

Honestly I might have to go with Arvis of Velthomer provided that the replacement occurs sometime before Chapter . As much of a great character that he is I dont think I would make the same mistakes that he did. Im just going to go with a wild guess and say that Grima and Ashera beat him but none of the other FE final bosses do but I have a tremendous lack of information for that.,fireemblemcasual,ctzo72a,2,t5_342g7

5118610,0,t3_3l3lh2,Oh god. Here we go.The anime itself is called Romeo x Juliet. Now before you write it off as another cheesy adaptation of Shakespeares Romeo and Juliet hear me out for a second. The anime itself is only loosely based off it.Lets start out with the shows atmosphere and setting. It has a simple fantasyesque setting that is very similar to Shadow Dragon. Its a show that skilfully balances its romance political intrigue and action into a  episode anime.The story itself also mirrors that of Shadow Dragon. After Akaneia is successfully invaded by Dolunas forces Prince Marth is exiled from his homeland in order to live another day. Because of this Marth is forced to build up his strength until he is  so that he could eventually lead a rebellion force in order to take back Akaneia.In Romeo X Juliet the leader of the House Capulet is slain by the leader of the House Montague in a coup dtat for the control of Neo Verona. The only surviving member of House Capulet Juliet is forced to hide until her th birthday. It is on the day of her th birthday that she is to then assume her role as the leader of a rebellion group that wishes to overthrow House Montagues oppressive reign over Neo Verona.Its also able to take itself seriously and doesnt even have any fanservice. It also has some great action scenes. THIS ANIME IS FUCKING AWESOME,fireemblemcasual,cv2zg1t,2,t5_342g7

You roll special dice to determine what your monster does on each turn.  You can attack heal score points or collect energy.  You can use the energy to buy powers to make your monster even stronger.

6247758,0,t1_cyzr7u9, USS Indianapolis. I did a report on it in my sophomore year in high school. The ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine before the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima In fact I believe it was carrying vital information regarding the construction on the bomb. The entire crew was forced to survive adrift in the middle of sharkinfested waters for a long period of time. I like survival stories so it interested me. I really REALLY fucking hate those terms. I find the whole culture built behind them to be really weird and cringy. However I KNOW most people are joking about it. So Im not accusing anybody of anything. If I absolutely HAD to give an answer I ended up marrying Olivia in my FEA file. But even then I consider that a major stretch. I suppose  STTGL sized Kamina. If its THAT big I dont think it could possibly have any means of physically supporting itself in real life. Id win by default. Medium I dont know what Fatestay night is. Sorry.

6356118,0,t3_42phzt,Watched about  episodes of Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei The Irregular at Magic HighSchool. It is... Alright. Its not terrible but its not great either. If anything it feels a bit like missed opportunities since the miniArc I am right now just feels really boring compared to the last one.The characters are good enough. Tatsuya is a bit too good at times and it shows since he is always in the right place at the right time and he is great at everything he does. If it wasnt for the fact that his eternal pokerface is amazing I would probably hate this guy.And then we have one of the worst characters that I have ever seen  Tatsuyas sister Miyuki. She is ridiculously bad. Like real bad. She is really clingy to Tatsuya I am pretty sure there is a special reason for this but alas it is annoying to the point that if someone says that he is getting along with a girl she is already freaking out freezing everything around. Seriously this girl cant say two sentences without mentioning Tatsuya which is just ridiculous. I know literally nothing about her character aside that she is a great magus and loves her brother because that is all they showed me.sigh At least the sidecharacters are pretty cool. Leo and Erika are specially funny but that is it.I still need to finish this but I am sure it wont be an anime that I will remember too much about because everything looks so forgettable.,fireemblemcasual,czc4cvy,1,t5_342g7

And dont you dare let the stigma about mental illness get you down  the way I see it we all have problems. Sometimes these problems have a medical name.

Makes it shame she also has her darkest moment too this arc too.gtAnd just like you I love the way she promotes herself. Being a regular director isnt enough for her. She needs to be an Ultra Director and its hilarious that she keeps upping things as the days go by.Its a shame they didnt keep coming up with more adjectives. Super Ultra Director  MEGA Director Omega Director TheOneAboveAllDirector etcgtShe can be such a pile of spaghetti at times.She want to keep Kyons noodle out of Mikuru p No but seriously go back and look at how she handles that.

8758276,0,t3_501cxj,gtBest twoeye colored characters?Not KurumiTamayura SeriesIf I had to choose what anime series I thought was the most underrated then that title would without a doubt go to Tamayura. Its no wonder it went under the radar because at first glance people will think that its just any other ordinary slice of life series. It kind of is intially but as time goes by and after watching it I know its so much more. Tamayura falls under the subgenre of Sliceoflife called iyashikei which are shows that have a healing affect. After seeing this and his two other works in the genre Aria and Amanchu! its clear to me that Director and Creator didnt create the two just mentioned just directed Junichi Satou has a deep fondness of it. Nowhere is this fondness more evident than in Tamayura.As an iyashikei show one way to judge Tamayura is to judge its ability to heal and Id say that Tamayura has that covered pretty damn well. I could frequently find myself smiling softly at the events that unfolded. Episodes vary in this capability but after just about every episode I did feel a bit more relaxed or more. There are occasionally episodes which do go the extra mile and offer a lot more touching stories and they all work amazingly. When Tamayura gets good it gets really really good. Because of this Tamayura has quite a deal of memorable moments that will stick with the viewer long after they watched it. But there are still some pretty memorable and heartwarming moments in the rest of the episodes so thats something to look out for.The characters of Tamayura are very likable. Other than Potte I wouldnt call them all that complex. But its all good since each character gets their time to shine at one point or another. What makes the cast so likable arent that theyre the epitome of character writing. What makes them so likable is that they all do feel like genuinely good people. Each of these characters support those around them and are overall nice to another and thats all you need in a show like this. They still have their own quirks but I never detested any of them due to this knowledge. Except for Komachi. Fuck Komachi.One thing I liked about Tamyura is the way that they characterized Pottes father. Hes already dead  years before the series begins but they were able to make it so that he recieved a ton of characterization regardless. This could easily be done through flashbacks but this shows handles its flashbacks cleverly. Pretty much all of the flashbacks about her dad are from Pottes point of view so they feel a bit more distant and faded. Because of this her dad doesnt have a voice or much of a face you can still tell how he looks like though. So instead to characterize him we rely on everything he left behind. The memories he left in the people he met in the town as well as the more tangible remnants of himself that he left. These remnants are brought to the forefront in multiple episodes of the series and through them youre able to tell very accurately what kind of person the guy was and over time its very easy to grow attached to his character just as much as the others.Tamayura to me is mainly a story of seizing opportunities. This manifests in the series through a thing called aggressiveness. Aggresiveness in the series is the capability and courage to create or take the many different opportunities that are present in life. By grasping at these opporunities your life can change for the better and allows you to live without regret. The main starting point of the series where Potte decides to ask her Mom to move to the town of Takehara is seen as an example of aggressiveness. And because of her aggressiveness all the events of the series are possible. Aggressiveness allows a person to move forward and inspire change in their lives. Despite the difficulty and the anxieties that making these decisions can bring you youll end up better for it in the end. Of course such a lesson isnt exactly new but its better to judge these types of things by the strength of which it delivers its message rather than what it is unless its god awful. I love seeing how Potte grows through the series. Her actions always take her to a better place than she was previously and by the end reflecting on the events of the series I can look at her position and be satisfied. So many of the events of the series wouldnt have been possible without her aggressiveness and that only goes to show what power such a concept holds.Although this isnt a novel concept I still like that time actually passes in Tamayura. We see the characters go through  years of High School and it definitely feels like it. We see the seasons change we see town events happen multiple times and we see them deal with issues that deal with this passage of time. It doesnt feel static and events happening multiple times makes the town itself come to life. This all leads into the final  movies which deal with their third year and deal with stuff that people in their final year of high school would deal with like finding the right college finding out what you want to do as a career and most of all saying goodbye. This allows us to see new sides to the characters and acknowledge their growth in both emotionally and physically.Im quite fond of the art in Tamayura. Being a slice of life it doesnt need to do much with its art so I can forgive its simplicity. It thankfully does have quite a few things going for it. One is the character designs. Not amazing but they do the job. Special mention goes to Pottes design for making her look really soft had way too much trouble trying to find an example of this that stood out. Earns her a lot of points in the cuteness department. I also like how the character designs change for movies. Theyre not a dramatic shift but they make the characters look a bit older and an older appearance works better with the movies considering what theyre about. Another strength with the art is that some of the backgrounds and scenery can look gorgeous Occasionally were fed with some really great looking shots and theyre usually well deserved.The music in Tamayura isnt godly but I still liked. Ive commented before that Tamayura has better insert songs as Love Live! Sunshine!! and I still believe that not a big accomplishment really. Granted Tamayuras music is completely different from that show but in terms of quality Tamayura blows it out of the water. I love these insert songs I do. Probably has to do with me preferring more calm and emotional music. Also has to with how the insert songs are expertly integrated in the show. They play at the exact right time where the music syncs perfectly with the scene to add the greatest effect. The rest of the soundtrack does its job well. Like I said its not godly but theres some nice and relaxing tunes here that fit very well with the show.Cant say this about most series not even for most of the shows in my top  but I think Tamayura earned it. I love this show. I remember I said that Tamayura was working at getting me emotionally attached but it looks like it worked a bit too much. Tamayura is a series I would cheesily describe as a series with heart. I could feel it throughout that Junichi Satou was pouring his heart into this project. Does Tamayura have flaws? Yes. It can get boring at times the characters for the most part act younger than they are most of the jokes dont work that well and characters can sometimes be pretty annoying. Its also very polarizing and as a result very difficult to recommend. But do I care? Yeah kind of. But thats besides the point. The show almost literally envelopes the viewer in such large amounts of warmth that it was difficult for me to not get caught up in its pace and fall in love.I need to let it sink in a bit more but its very likely that Tamayura will end up in my top  anime with the final movie as the representative. Where it will go exactly I dont know but itll probably be there.ScoresTamayura  Tamayura Hitotose  Tamayura More Aggressive  Tamayura Graduation Photo Part   Tamayura Graduation Photo Part   Tamayura Graduation Photo Part   Tamayura Graduation Photo Part   Giniro HarukaIts out now!

Watched episodes .  were some of the best episodes of the whole show so far probably. I had been on the fence for a little while but I dont know how anyone can watch episode  and then not think that Rem is best girl. I actually discussed this with upikrob on Discord yesterday and we got into a debate where he absolutely eviscerated me and I had no defense.But still I like Rem a whole lot even if Rob will destroy me in a casual argument about it. After watching  though Crusch is right there with Rem and Emilia honestly. These episodes were entertaining but not quite as good. I couldnt take a couple of parts of the white whale fight seriously ReZeros Wilhelm pulled a Sharknado . Are you serious right now?This has been very entertaining though. I think this show is pretty overhyped but it is nonetheless quite good.gtShow with best OP and ED combination of  so far?ERASED.

9071702,0,t3_54hpx2,Hi Haar Im really glad you decided to write this as hard as it can be. Its super courageous. I know how hard it can be to even reach out to people and let them know youre struggling. Maybe you were raised similarly to me but growing up I was really taught to be strongstrong as in never asking for help or opening up. Like for many years between  years old I just kept all my anxiety to myself. So thats really awesome that youre sharing this. Its not easy. OK Im going to do this maybe stupid thing of speaking broadly from my personal experience but here goes I think sometimes that existential anxiety can point you toward something that you need. It can be like a little alarm bell telling you that your current life is NOT matching up with who you want to be as a person. Maybe who you are right now but not who you want to be. For me I had a ton of existential anxiety through college. It was part of a difficult process of being reborn as a person that Im still going through now. It began at the end of high school at what should have been my biggest success getting into an Ivy League. But at college I crashed and burned. I kept my grades up because it was all I knew how to do but beside that I was very unhappy. I had attacks of existential panics of sometimes upward of twice a day. I wouldnt go to class for weeks sometimes. A lot of days I would get extremely angry and actively avoid other people. I went to therapy through student health insurance because I honestly felt like I was going insane. How did I get so far and now was undoing all my hard work? Im really really glad youre doing therapy. It was one of the biggest gamechangers for me. That and daily journalling and mindfulnessmeditative activities.What I eventually came to realize after a couple of years years its not an overnight fix at all that the problem was that I was so lopsided as a person. I was academically smart but thats all I knew how to be. I didnt know how to connect with people not on a deeper level beyond small talk. That was what was most important to me in life to feel the sense of connection to people and a community larger than myself.Im starting to move in that direction now after Ive graduated. I was really fortunate to luck into some great friends here on reddit that I get to correspond with. Although I didnt know how I felt about higher powers I did join the Unitarians who are very welcoming to agnostics and atheists. Maybe you want to look into that if you want a community of people who think about these existential issues without the frame of dogma. Anyway this is super long but from someone who has had a ton of existential anxiety I know how scary it is. Just be patient with yourself if you can and dont try to pressure yourself to just be normal or hide it through drugs or alcohol. Its part of the necessary reevaluation process to get yourself on a track where you can be happier.I really encourage you to journal just for  minutes every morning. Dont try to erase anything. Write in pen to avoid it. You can write anything. Sometimes my  minutes was some deep poetic stuff sometimes its just a list of things I need to do sometimes its just a cuss word over and over because I didnt know how else to express how I feel. Just let yourself rest on the page. NEVER show it to anyone unless you really want to. The journal is for you. Listen to yourself and be really kind to yourself. You really are going to have to be the most compassionate person for you during this time.Im sorry my advice cant be more specific but existential anxiety is kind of a nebulous shithole. But necessary. If you do some of the things I list finding a community journaling therapy youll come out of it on the other side. I promise. You dont have to believe me but I know you can. Again PM me if you like.Best wishesCat,fireemblemcasual,d829sei,3,t5_342g7

Hes not the only analytic shonen character but a tactical guy like him whose a nice guy and a hard worker is definitely uncommon.I was saying that Im quite sure weve had more tactical focused shounen MCs in the past and that that trait isnt as unique as you make it out to be.gtuh all I got was a blank picture.Exactly. Its a bit risque but I thought youd appreciate it.gtIt was unnecessary fanservice but was good fanservice.No because any time devoted to Yukino and Yui that could be devoted to Iroha is a bad thing in my book.,fireemblemcasual,dbz6dqu,1,t5_342g7

10239255,0,t3_5mmf7v,Diabolik Lovers More BloodOH MY GOD!! I forgot how amazing Diabolik Lovers was. Diabolik Lovers is still one of the best comedy anime out there. Really if anybody wants to have a good laugh Diabolik Lovers is a must.First episode was awesome and encapsulated why I love this series as much as I do. So we start off with a bunch of shoehorned in biblical symbolism with Yui directly being referred to as Eve which when you know how badly written this series is you will start to find the humor in that. Then it was just a dream and you have  of the male vampires at her bedside complaining about how loud she was when she woke up instead of worrying about her. They then go on to all force themselves on her to drink her blood. Brilliant. Already sold on this season. Then we go to the entire cast being in a limo and being the closeknit family that they are they all start fighting. Why? I dunno. Then in one last final hurrah one of them blames Yui for it even though she was in the corner doing absolutely nothing. Not even the best part. Right after that the limo goes of the road and crashes into a tree bursting into flames instantly. Best show ever! Diabolik Lovers keeps on throwing surprises at me. Thats not all. They survive because vampires and they see  bishounen off into the distance. We return to their mansion and then when Yui is outside shes ambushed by the  they saw. Theyre all are every bit as abusive and assholish as the already established harem. We get twice the asshole this season and I couldnt be happier. I think Im in love.Demichan wa KataritaiIt was alright I guess. Couldnt think of much it did wrong but it didnt wow me either. It has a teacher MC so thats cool since while I know its been done before I havent experienced it yet. I like the whole message it has going on with demihumans and how they actually do want to talk about what its like to be one. Its not something to be treated as taboo or anything and can create a disconnect between themselves and others. If we were to apply this to a real world setting the same idea can probably be applied to people of different cultures living in a place surrounded by completely different people. Thats a nice message I suppose. Only kind of complaint I have about it is that the demihumans arent exactly all that remarkable. By that I mean Id rather vampires be much more interesting entities than just humans but with a small thirst for blood and being a bit bad with sunlight. I think thats probably purposeful to help humanize the demihumans and to make the audience see them as normal people but I think it could still be done with more exaggerated traits.SeirenYES!! Its everything I hoped it would be. Seiren as a spiritual successor to Amagami is doing everything right so far. The dialogue feels so natural compared to other shows of its type as these characters actually act and look like theyre in high school. They dont arbitrarily introduce characters coughMasamunekuncough and nothing is forced. The characters all feel quirky enough to not fall too far into anime tropes while also still being just anime enough to be entertaining in their own right. Im really liking the MC. Hes got lowkey perversion in him like any kid his age would but hes still a relatively normal guy in all the right ways. Hes also very proactive and actually tries to improve himself so hes not just a guy who is static while stuff happens around him. The other characters are also nice too. MCs two best friends are cool and arent the butt end of jokes and the MCs big sister is also nice. Shes has a just right level of bratty supportive and somewhat mature to her. The only heroine given a significant amount of screentime so far is Hikari who is just like the other characters quite likable. Her teasing of the MC is just right and there is certainly a small air of mystery around her right now. I think MRAMGruzzlacks will like her since shes played by Ayane Sakura and she fits the role perfectly.Mob Psycho Second episode was a huge improvement over the first. It wasnt amazing but the second episode gave the show a lot more direction and I hope it sticks to it. They introduced and began to explore Mobs whole coming of age story and I think its being done incredibly well. If they focus on that then I see myself really liking this show.Urara MeirochouIts pretty standard moe stuff. The fortune telling looks like it could be interesting though and I smiled at least  times throughout the episode so this show must be doing something right to illicit this type of response out of me.gtWhen taking only visuals into account what are your favorite anime OPsEDs?For OPs probably the OP for The Perfect InsiderFor EDs its Balance Unbalance from GJBu,fireemblemcasual,dc4odjz,2,t5_342g7

11644829,0,t3_6661ih,Oh boy apparentely more work to be done. That class just keeps being a roller coaster between shit and cool. And it is decided that there is transportation for this weekend. Time to get my camera ready. Besides that day was a mix of work and feeling unwell after lunch. That movie during class didnt help either. Seeing a movie on reverse puts me under stress since I try to play it normally on my brain and with such soundtrack. Bleargh. Looks like a profound movie but no. Not for me.,fireemblemcasual,dgfye61,2,t5_342g7

11783748,0,t3_684db6,One Punch ManEpisode What a fantastic way to end. This episode had all the right elements in all the right places.eps That overthetop battle at the beginning of the episode was just so fitting. That shot of the clouds splitting was spot on. And following the complete ridiculousness of that battle we get Boros letting all of us know that Saitama still had power left in him. Just how are they going to top that massive spectacle in season ?My personal favorite moment was when eps Saitama busts his way out of the ship and he and Genos just start walking away like its no big deal. Having Tatsumaki in that scene just added to the fun.The runner up was the postcredits last line eps Just one punch again! God dammit!Not only that but there are interesting teases for season  eps Mask and Metal Knight look like they might be upcoming antagonists which would be a shift from the straightforward heroes vs. monsters stuff.Final thoughtsI had a ton of fun watching OPM. The jokes were fun the action was cool and every moment was interesting there wasnt any filler or needless material.Dont worry uSilverKnightZ Ill start Mob sometime soon.gt Game Day My grandma was responsible for introducing me to anime. My last relationship almost ended because of anime music. I once wrote Fruits Basket fanfiction.,fireemblemcasual,dgvq5iv,2,t5_342g7
