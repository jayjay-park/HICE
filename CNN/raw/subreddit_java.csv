70356,0,t3_1uwfje,First you need to understand that static fields are not really inherited by instances. Java foolishly in my opinion allows you to reference a static field from an instance variable but this is misleading because its really just looking at the declared type of the variable.That said the decision to disallow static fields in inner classes was a judgement call by the language designers. It doesnt matter that inner classes need a reference to an instance of the outer class to be constructed because you dont need an instance to access static fields. And actually static fields are allowed in inner classes so long as they are final and constant. From JLS ..gt Inner classes may not declare static members unless they are constant variables .. or a compiletime error occurs.If I were to guess I think the decision was made because it isnt really a necessary or important thing and it could be argued that it makes code less clear or misleading to be allow static members in an inner class. But that doesnt really explain why certain constant fields are allowed. For example static final int n   is allowed but not static final Object o  null. Weirdly while static final String s  abc is allowed static final String s  null is not. To me this smells of implementation details leaking into the spec.,java,cemft6l,11,t5_2qhd7

You can have a var of value true and it will throw an error in a boolean condition under some conditions but if you do true then it will work.  I dont get it.  Sometimes it works like I expect it to other times Im just like boggle.Honestly if you have a wrapper class for every type they should be able to transform as the case with string to boolean with relative ease.  Throw an exception if the string isnt true or false  fine.  But Dont tell me true isnt a valid BooleanValue.,java,cex7puc,2,t5_2qhd7

208324,0,t1_cf25b5e,gtWhat is it with people so against using tabs for indentation?Consistency for readability.  You can tell at a glance the indent level no matter where you are reading the code your editor or theirs on a printout etc because the spacing is constant.Copypasting code into different editors can result in weird layouts when you use tabs E.g. pasting into a Word document or email window.People do things like tab then hit a couple spaces to line things up then the next person replaces the tab with spaces.  Or puts spaces in before the tab. This results in annoying whitespace merges but also just layout problems.Spaces are easier to deal with since you know exactly how many characters there are. Tabs are environmentspecific to someones configurations of what a tab should mean.In general spaces are easier to deal with even if they are extra keystrokes so they probably devolve to the KISS principle.,java,cf266kd,7,t5_2qhd7

I have talked with my teacher and apparently out of my initial  ideas the rd one is the best one so far but still have some time to find another one if i so choose.The sculpture idea sounds fun sadly its required to have a real use and not just for show.The reflection idea  Not  sure i understand with my limited english but what i would have to do is identify faces in pictures that have some kind of reflective surface. Meaning detect faces in pictures that are found on such surfaces and maybe match the face to a known face out of a pool of other pictures ? If so it sounds quite complicated i mean you would have to recognize a face on angled surfaces... dont completely understand what you mean by eye reflection.Reminder app  This sounds really cool and i really like the idea. And i am pretty sure i would enjoy making it but wouldnt you need a pretty impressive database to store all the locations you pass by and not only that but specific things about them  like opening hours closing and other.Timeline app  basically make an app where everything is centralized what happened with your contacts social media camera maybe even sensors. It looks really good also something i am really considering of doing. Great idea. Also it seems to me that its the easiest of them all to make. Tho i wouldnt be surprised if its already been done.Hard limits are happening and for starters i will make them as strict as possible. Once i get the ball rolling maybe i will loosen them up.Thank you so much for your feedback and help.

Like say your app needs an index to be in a file location and its not there.   Silly things like index out of bounds exceptions.  Ways to predict?  Hard to say good coding prevents lots of these.  But as is the nature of software it happens and when it does youll likely say wtf that shouldnt happen.In some cases with developer experience you will surround obvious places of danger with try catch blocks and some sort of recovery code like trying again displaying nice error flagging amp logging it.  Its always the nonobvious bugs and its hard to predict and Im not sure there is a way.  Static code analysis might be able to provide some hints but you can probably predict most of those.  Like any resource IO is obvious.  But array out of bounds are usually not cause people usually think they write the code in a safe way.,java,cgqze3u,3,t5_2qhd7

1353816,0,t1_cilyogi,gt If your project are IDE independent e.g. Maven  go for it. Dont waste your precious time with Eclipse or Netbeans.I wouldnt agree completely with the above.  Netbeans has great Maven support out of the box as well.  Its also created by the same people that make Java so its going to support the latest and greatest features of JavaJava EE first.  I had experience with Eclipse  meclipse for maven because I worked with another companys codebase and it wasnt pretty.  Things that just worked in Netbeans required a bunch of resets and delete this folder now regenerate now reset configuration data again clean and build finally it worked! with Eclipse.Edit Cant comment on IntelliJ but with maven projects Netbeans doesnt require any IDE specific files either which is NOT the case for Eclipse.In reality I like that theres  major IDEs.  I get to use the one I want but they all benefit from the others existence for adding new features and trying to stay ahead of each other.,java,cilzq18,2,t5_2qhd7

Dependency injection is indeed not specific to JSF and in the current JSF version . you would not even use the JSF version of this but the Java EE platform technology CDI.Alternative web frameworks like Spring MVC have perhaps an even greater dependency on uhm dependency injection.I do agree with you that a lightweight version or something with better defaults would be nice.

1603991,0,t3_2cm8vc,I just resently started a carreer as a Java Developer myself m so I can remember the things I had a hard time with like it was yesterday.What I had the most trouble with carreer wise is the configuration of a lot of frameworks. Java in itself is relatively easy especially since you already are an experienced developer its the frameworks that require the most time to learn. A lot of them require a certain amount of configuration mostly in XML. Learning how to set them up was mostly trial and error in my case. Like someone else said in the comments pet projects are the best way to learn this. So to answer your question about what I hate about Java this configuring is it. Stuff like that is easier in say C. However if you join an already existing project the configuration is already done most of the time although not always very good.Now for the resources. I really did a bad job with Java in my first year of college but this guy really helped me with his tutorials I got  percent when I took the exam again The New Boston  I linked you the beginner tutorials but he also has intermediate. Effective Java  is also a good resource like mentioned in the comments. Another one I like is The WellGrounded Java Developer  It is a really balanced book talking about important things like Threading the JVM Dependency Injection Continuous integration etc.I would suggest you first do some little projects to get a feeling with Java as a language and then stepping over to frameworks like Spring and hibernate. Check the differences between Spring and Java EE read about dependency injection Martin Fowler has a great article about this etc.This turned out longer than I expected so Ill leave it at this.

1653184,0,t1_cjnjd5v,Saving  characters of typing is pretty valuable on its own when you do it all the damn time. It also reduces syntactic noise making the code more readable.One of Javas biggest problems is that its really noisy. Shit like public and void is everywhere repeated constantly. Thats a lot of BS that one has to visually filter out to grasp what the code actually means.I like Scala because among other things it makes great strides in bringing that about. public is the default access level. There is a shorthand syntax for methods that dont return anything. Types can often be omitted e.g. on variablefield declarations. Custom operators means I can define a plain old  method for a class where that would make sense instead of having to say add everywhere. These features mean that poorlywritten code is even harder to read but wellwritten code is vastly easier.,java,cjnjpoc,4,t5_2qhd7

Does CDI provide declarative transactions and security instance pooling and remoting?No CDI does not provide that.In Java EE  declarative transactions actually have been reimplemented as a CDI interceptor. Its the Transactional annotation contributed to the platform by JTA. Its a close copy of the way EJB works with a small enhancement.See this zeef block for more info about that Instance pooling and binary remoting still have to be implemented. I wonder where instance pooling will be done maybe that will be CDI itself.Remoting is a bit troublesome. Im a big fan of EJBs Remote but I think the EG specially the lead Bill Shanon wants to get rid of it in favor of JAXRS.There are of course more things in EJB like Asyncronous RolesAllowed technically not an EJB annotation but still and the timer service which would need to be reimplemented as CDI interceptors andor extensions.,java,ck1o8st,5,t5_2qhd7

1800222,0,t1_ck611ye,gt Well no getters and setters arent implementation details. Since gt theyre methods their implementation can change.Getters and setters are methods yes. But they dont exist to tell an object to do something they are not behaviors so what exactly is the purpose of getters and setters?gt There are different levels of data hiding appropriate at different levels gt of abstractiongranularity. Of course which is why getterssetters have a purpose. For example data binding.gt People get into all sorts of problems with they equate objects with gt modules.Lets stick with objects and programming with objects. Unless Alan Kay is wrong isnt OOP about messaging and retention and hiding of process state? About modeling the flow of behavior messages rather than the flow of data? Why is retention of process state important?gt This is a misunderstanding.I think you are misunderstanding his objection to getterssetters. The author is equating the flow of data into and out of objects to the leakage of implementation details.gt Yes if you make massive changes to the definition of an important gt class in the system thats going to affect a lot of code. Isnt the Liskov Substitution Principle a cornerstone of OOP?gt The author gives us no reason at all to think that this might be true.Perhaps so. But if getterssetters expose data about an object to its collaborators do they not increase the coupling between them? Doesnt increased coupling between objects make classes less robust in the face of change? Tighter coupling isnt always bad such as in the case of data binding between a template and its backing object. Which is why getterssetters arent always bad.gt Youre still going to have essentially the same code just in a different gt file.But isnt the location of the code and its organization what differentiates paradigms? Why do classes bind data and methods? If not to localize data and the responsibility decision making based on that data? If data spreads does not the decision making responsibility on that data spread? Isnt that the problem with violation of encapsulation?This is the idea of both the Law of Demeter and principle of Tell dont Ask. Also theres the principle of CommandQuery Separation. What is the point of these principles? Are you opposed to these principles or not consider them good guides to developing objectoriented programs?,java,ck62p0z,2,t5_2qhd7

1829215,0,t3_2fhvs0,Recursion is all about taking larger problems and breaking them down into smaller problems of the same type. You repeat this until you reach a base case essentially the smallest problem of that type with a trivial answer. This is the key to recursion. Recursion only makes sense if you have an end goal in mind otherwise youre just endlessly repeating the same process over and over again without a result. Once youve reached the most trivial solution you can then back up and take the solution from these smaller problems and use them to solve the larger problems. A simple example is calculating factorial. Heres the recurrence relation.So what is our base case? The smallest factorial you can possibly have is ! which is defined to be . gt !  We can use this as part of the solution for !.gt !        !    !      And so on...gt !        !    !      gt !        !    !      gt !        !    !      gt ...gt n!  n   n   !Some sample code        int factorial int x          Base case ! is always .        if x              return                 Where x is not  we use recursion        else           return x  factorial x                       ,java,ck9m2ts,5,t5_2qhd7
1848162,0,t1_ckbqdu8,Variables are not the only things to have value expressions have them too. Its pretty trivial to guess the value of an expression like int x   its . or the value of true || false. But what is the type and value of something more complicated like a ternary expression?     Object o  true? i  d is an expression where second and third operands have different numeric types. Before the result can be assigned to o the the type and value of this expression have to be determined. What do we make it Double or Integer?    Thats where Java spec . comes in. In your case we have an expression with operands of different but convertible numeric types  and according to spec the type of the expression is the promoted type of the second and third operands. This is how binary numeric promotion is done. tldr   if needed unbox both operands to primitives  if one of the two operands is of type double the other is promoted to double as well.        So what happens here is this     the entire expression is determined to be of type double       at runtime the conditional part evaluates to true so the first operand is chosen. It is an Integer so     . we unbox it with i.intValue    . since we need double and not int we cast the result to double and then box the whole thing to Double again    see uflif s answer    And because you assigned i to be null i.intValue throws a NullPointerException.    Now in your second example the NPE doesnt happen because we dont have to deduce the resulting type of the expression. You tell explicitly what type it will have with casting the whole mess sorry the second operand to Object.  Object is the supertype of Double so the expression type is determined to be Object as well. ,java,ckbwdej,5,t5_2qhd7
1852268,0,t3_2fsp29,What Ive found is that most employers arent looking for everything they list. A few different things can happen HR just got a list of things to look for and put them all into the ad this also applies to screening interviews. Theyre advertising for several different teams and just lumped all the skills together. Theyre chancing their arm in the hope that theyll get a a developer with exactly the skillset they need.There are probably other reasons but those are the majority that Ive run into. Id apply for the job if I knew most of the technologies asked for or had worked with similar tech in the past. My CV and LinkedIn profile list my most familiar tech along with key projects demonstrating that knowledge so it shouldnt be hard for a potential employer to see where my strengths are.Once youre in the technical interview dont be afraid to say that you havent used a technology. No one should expect you to have used every library or tool available and if they do expect that then you most likely dont want to work for the company. The key point is that youre willing and able to learn.Having said that Id expect a fullstack developer in my area to be quite familiar with Spring Hibernate web services relational DBs unit testing MavenGradle HTMLCSSJavaScript and a few other things.

2468915,0,t3_2ntrzw,Id like to emphasize finalize its something really scary to overrode and really hurts the garbage collector. For example what if your deallocation process actually requires you to allocate a byte of data? Now you have an object in the eden space being referenced by an object that has been marked as unreachabledead. Technically that new byte should also be dead but is not because your object is still kind of alive and needs that new byte.Furthermore one benefit that a GC can provide over a traditional explicit allocatordeallocation process is memory placement. Each time the garbage collector is run it can reorganize the memory in a way such that fragmentation is minimized and temporal and spacial locality is exploited. This really gets more into runtime optimizations instead of garbage collecting though so Im not sure if this is entirely relevant. Nice writeup. I skipped the diagnosis section since its getting late but overall its decent.,java,cmguv6c,3,t5_2qhd7

If a thread calls methods from several classes then all the methods can see the ThreadLocal variable set by other methods because they are executing in same thread. The value need not be passed explicitly. Its like how you would use global variables.So if you make your ThreadLocal globally accessible then it will behave as a global variable  no shit Sherlock!

As someone with a Ruby background I thought they were honestly the worst templating engines I used and often fell back to just using ERB.gt . The rest of JSTL is just tags that look exactly like HTML which I cant stand.This is what I appreciate about JSP. I can see it being a matter of taste but taglibs are a big selling point for me. Being able to do ltmyappmywidget itemitemgt is a lot nicer than lt render partial blah item item gt or some garbage especially since they can be type checked by my IDE.gt JSP is also fundamentally lacking a sane way to do sitewide layouts and swap out different subtemplates based on the page you are on so theres that.This is where Tiles comes into play.

3420381,0,t1_cpi4pxb,OK but at least for now it seems like the JDK is not going to follow that route so your code would not be idiomatic and youd still have to do all those null checks when working with the JDK or thirdparty libraries. The nullness checker has you covered as the code is both idiomatic and interoperates well with the JDK.As to annotations these isnt Hibernate magic or any such thing. In Java  you have type annotations so the annotation is just a part of the type so for example you can have ListltNullable Stringgt which allows null values or ListltNullable Stringgt which doesnt. Instead of options you have    void fooListltNullable Stringgt xs          String x  xs.get  lt doesnt compile        Nullable String x  xs.get        if x ! null             String y  x  this compiles             ....

3643527,0,t1_cq7drzb,Well I actually meant that many of the more experienced people here have seriously considered Scala some time ago and found it to be seriously problematic. You are forgetting or perhaps too young to remember how a lot of people myself included were thrilled with C for a good few years until its full horror became clear. We were the ones saying the platitude you are now repeating we were the ones dismissing warnings about the language being too clever... until we learned our lesson and have now become attuned to recognizing duds worse danger. It will happen to you too and youll be able to know the next CScala when it comes around and then youll be able to resist those junior developers saying what you just have.Thankfully there are enough people now able to recognize Scala for what it is which is why organizations with enough experienced workforce are rejecting it so it wont become a serious problem for the software industry like C and instead will be used only by those who somehow manage to tame it. Sure there will be casualties unfortunately there already are but it wont become a Cscale disaster. Note BTW that C today is quite OK actually as it is no longer used wholesale but only by some niche and relatively small shops able to hire people who wont make a mess of it. I reckon the same will happen with Scala.BTW Cs disastrous effect was one of the main reasons for Javas wildfire adoption. Organizations clamoured for something simpler. Java was the response to a toocleverforitsowngood language. Of course Scala is far too small to have the same effect on the industry and again many have said fool me once... but weve actually seen what happens when organizations adopt a clever language and the signs are already there for Scala i.e. the first casualties have already fallen and some are already on the edge so we know to keep our distance. But just like Americans have forgotten that strong regulation was the response to the disastrous effect of an unregulated market of the end of the nineteenth beginning of the twentieth century  and a much calledfor rescue  some people forget the hardwon lesson here too.OTOH in my company weve already adopted alongside Java Clojure and Kotlin  two languages designed by people who have learned their lesson unsurprising considering the backgrounds of the people involved with the creation of Java Clojure and Koltin vs. the background of those behind Scala.,java,cq7l7sg,6,t5_2qhd7

In the Java enterprise context JSF and Spring both featured DI and had their . release at exactly the same time.Spring didnt really improve its DI much while Java EE took it to the next level by taking the best ideas from JSFs DI system scopes and EJBs annotations and proxies and then drawing further inspiration from Guice to come out with a vastly superior solution.CDI is contextual fully typesafe and build from the ground up to be annotationnoXML based.Those are all things that Spring didnt implement because the thought they were at the top of the game with no competition in sight.And nobody was talking about Spring boot or data but DI as a core value asset was mentioned and I agree that Spring dropped the ball there by not providing any significant updates for a long time.,java,cs3abpz,2,t5_2qhd7

And no on stackoverflow JSF leads by a narrow margin at this writing around .  Taken together with comparing the spring and javaee questions tagged perhaps thats simply an indicator of how hard JSF is to use. JSF Spring MVCAnd like you attempted to do on your previous post with indeed.com job posts you compare one thing in Spring to multiple  things in EE to bolster your numbers.   Primefaces is an impl not a spec.If JSF is so awesome why does the MVC . JSR exist?  Its pretty obvious that its borrowing Spring MVC and ASP.net concepts.Yawn.  This whole conversation is pretty irrelevant because Javascript.  The MVC logic has been moving off to the client since around  rendering JSF irrelevant.   SpringMVC will continue to thrive because its a single API for both REST and WebApps and wont be rendered irrelevant by this trend since people are flocking to Spring for the backend and were actually solving hard problems for those with Single Page JS Apps and a Java backend  Im going to get back to working on modern Java concerns in Spring  like asset pipelining CORS support and reactive web support that isnt based on the servlet API while EE is working on the MVC .

Most of the new C . features are due to participation of the .NET community in user voice.There was a  hour video on YouTube in which two Microsoft employees were showing new features of C . and while I didnt watch the whole video they mentioned that new features in C . are those that have been wanted the most by the community rather than Microsoft adding features that the community might not want at all. nameof String interpolation and a few other features were mentioned.Even JavaScript now has String interpolation. Even JSP has it! And I personally like to see it in Java but without a place where we can easily and transparently see how many people are in favour of a feature and how many are against it we cant know for sure what the community really wants.JCP is great but it is not as transparent as a place like User Voice. Most communication is email based. No one page where you can go to and vote or propose features etc.At least we can give it a try.

4808559,0,t3_3gqx25,I am currently using Red Hat Fuse which is a packaged up version of Camel and ActiveMQ. This is in use on a very large scale enterprise project. Camel and ActiveMQ are indeed separate things and using one does not mean you need to use the other. I can say that it is a phenomenal integration platform to work with. We have integrations with REST SOAP Files and databases with JPA.You are correct the ActiveMQ provides message queuing and reliability and Camel provides routing and transformation.For our routes that use ActiveMQ we read messages out of queues and route and transform those messages with Camel. We also have other routes that dont use ActiveMQ they can get input from a REST or SOAP endpoint or maybe a file. Most times the input to our routes gets persisted into an Oracle database. We are using OpenJPA as our JPA provider.So the whole thing is pretty flexible and you can make it into something that fits your environment very nicely.,java,cu0npri,6,t5_2qhd7

Java is more typically used serverside where its in much wider use than people think think Google Netflix Twitter etc.. The vast majority of complaints like In a perfect world there would be no Java are from people who probably have no idea what Java is used for other than applets.Its also important to distinguish between Java the language and Java the ecosystem  JVM especially because Java isnt the only language that runs on the JVM and many other JVM languages have very good integration with Java e.g. Groovy Clojure Scala etc.. As a language Java especially before Java  is rather verbose but easy to understand and was missing some arguably important features like closures well until Java .In some ways it also gives static typing a bit of a bad name since Javas implementation of it is somewhat awkward and limited. This is far less of an issue in other JVM languages which range from much more advanced static typing e.g. Scala to optional static typing e.g. Groovy to fully dynamic e.g. Clojure Jython JRuby etc.Finally theres the problem of Oracle owning Java since Oracle is one of the poster children for blatantly evil corporation in the software world.,java,cuq1bo2,21,t5_2qhd7

6280046,0,t1_cz3cc1f,MySQL does all sorts of things that are wrong but make it easy to use for nondatabase people. Empty column the same as null? Sure why not. Case insensitive text fields by default? Sure people dont really want equality. Referential integrity in the default storage engine? Nah foreign keys are only for database wonks and are definitely not web scale.There are more just search for them.Its since been fixed but I ran into a nasty group by issue a while back that caused some big issues for me. MySQL totally accepted the query but did what it thought was right and gave very inconsistent results. When I imported the data into PostgreSQL it barfed on the actual SQL and when I fixed it suddenly the results were consistent and correct.Just use PostgreSQL and be done with it. Its no harder to install than MySQL is now and it actually works as youd expect it to.,java,cz3gypm,7,t5_2qhd7
6281812,0,t3_41mm3b,Books and theory are all well and nice but how much did you actually program?A lot more important than theoretical knowledge what you get from books is practical experience.You can read all available books about a subject especially in programming and have immense theoretical knowledge but will fail on even simple programming tasks because you have never learned to program.Reading books about programming is roughly the comparison lacks a lot like reading books about a spoken language. If you dont ever speak the language use it more or less live in the language you will never become proficient.I said above that the comparison lacks a lot because programming in any language is a whole lot more than knowing programming languages. Programming requires a different way of thinking abstractalgorithmic thinking a skill that can mainly be acquired only through practice i.e. through actual programming.Sure the books give you some headstart but what you need to do much more than learning other languagesframeworks etc. is to practice. To work.Write programs. Lots of programs.Visit the programming related subreddits like rjavahelp rlearnjava rlearnprogramming and try to solve other peoples problems. Solve them by actually doing the programs not by reading booksgoogling. This will really boost your skills and take you on the way to being employable.,java,cz3o6v3,6,t5_2qhd7

Keep the following in mind though.If you want to use the latest and the greatest technologies then consider expanding outside of Java EE unless you want to implement Java EE to mimic those new technologies.  In time after the dust has settled for each of those technologies within their respective markets Java EE will incorporate the things that stick.That being stated you might prefer a different stack thats considered more up with the times such as Spring Vert.x etc.,java,d1k00g0,5,t5_2qhd7

8135771,0,t3_4pjf73,Hi Im Rob who is the Ebean maintainer. Some good questions here and comments so just to add my perspective on it.Maven central reports  downloads of the main Ebean artifact a month. However a big chunk of that Id say  is likely to go to Minecraft plugins  where Ebean has been used for many years maybe  years. So  downloads a month for everyone else but then Ebean has been releasing versions approx  per week over the last year so  person could often download  versions in a month etc and youve got CI servers etc. Its hard to know what those numbers actually mean in terms of adoption but there you go.In terms of documentation Id have to say that is the big work on at the moment. Its been getting a lot of attention and work recently past  months or so and if youve looked at the videos page youll find quite a few there now  the videos allow me to talk about why things work in a certain way etc so I think that is a useful addition to normal text documentation.  There is still a good chunk of documentation that needs to be updated.The contra to the documentation is that Ebean is much easier for people to use relative to JPA both in terms of optimising queries fetch what you need and persisting. Ive been bumping into people and not even knowing they have been using Ebean so that has been good  suggesting a lot of Ebean users find it obvious  intuitive to use.The Ebean community does seem small. I think there are  subscribed to the mailing list  github watchers  github stars. My thought is that they also are not that vocal.Marketing wise I personally have to take responsibility there in terms of Ebeans low profile. For a period I intentionally kept it low profile as life was busy then I kept it low profile as my focus was on bug fixing for the existing community ... and now Ive just gone through  year of feature development sponsorship where my focus was on technically building and documenting those features.  Long term Ebean exists because IMO JPQL is just really poor for defining how to build object graphs and I believe statelesssessionless ORM is much more fun to use and avoids lots of problems.  I cant see JPQL changing nor can I see JPA moving to a sessionless architecture.  So Ebean will continue on its path.  Ebean is now very close technically to where I want it to be  a little bit of sponsorshipdonations would be great to push that along.Hopefully that is interesting or useful.Cheers Rob.,java,d4uj986,1,t5_2qhd7

9336424,0,t1_d8zfv8u,Yep I think you and I are on the same page. I agree with all of that. I definitely encourage my devs to think about the architecture and reason about what a class is for when it is written In the case where an implementation might change in the future such as a wrapper for S data storage or some other remote dependency it is important that the public interface to a class be clean but it doesnt necessarily need to be enshrined in a separate Interface definition. If the time comes that the implementation does need to change it is trivial to extract the interface and create two implementations assuming the original implementation was clean in the first place. Thats the important part. I just dont like codebases to be cluttered with interfaces when they arent necessary.

9556738,0,t1_d9qxpl1,gt It is hard for me to really understand what was changed.Currently the JVM is like a big black box of C code for language implementors. You can sort of pour some bytecode into the top and hope that it reaches the JIT and that the JIT does something sensible with it but you cant really see or control what is going on.We reimplemented the JIT in Java code. As its just Java code you can use it like you can any other Java library with a much richer interface than bytecode so you can directly control what the JIT does. But using such a rich interface is hard so we also built a framework for writing languages that controls the new JIT compiler on your behalf and is easy to use called Truffle.gt It is the JVM version of PyPy?Yes very basically.gt Can static languages like Scala get some benefits?Yes.

I guess most of them tried to actually build complex stuff in JavaScript and then had to maintain that project.Im mainly a Java dev but due to customer demand Ive also done a few full stack projects where I did both the Angular  frontend and the Java Spring or JEE backend. There is no way Im going to ever do a frontend project in pure JS again. Refactoring is complete and utter hell compared to refactoring a Java backend in IntelliJ.gt Again code completion turns System.out.println into  key strokes.Not just that tools like Lombok take away most of the generate getters and setters work for you.

10277547,0,t1_dc8xs9u,It might be a reference to the use of the word sharp in mathematics in contexts of subsets sharper bounds means narrower or more precise bounds. As sharper bounds designate a smaller subset of the larger set sharper types describe more conditions on the values in turn making the value set smalled. Normal enum E has more values than enum EltStringgt after refactoring unless all enum values are ltStringgt in which case refactoring was pointless. This way you know more precisely what kind of values are expected the same with sharper bounds.At least thats how I read it. However I think Id rather use the word precise instead of sharp.Id say that typing sharpness or typing precision is yet another axis of typing systems along staticdynamic and weakstrong and is usually positively correlated with staticness.

Hell even C would be kinda slow that way since youre basically describing CGI scripts and theres a good reason Java beat those on performance even before it had JIT!The whole damn point of serverless technologies is that they will never spin up a whole damn container to execute a single method call instead the container and the JVM will be up the whole time with the worst case being that it has to load some classes and you could even optimize that by just paging in a preJITed image from some lowlatency storage ever heard of SSDs?.,java,dcax8fq,10,t5_2qhd7

11039146,0,t1_deixs8x,Would you say that class was welldesigned and had only one responsibility though?If I opened up a class and it was  lines my first reaction would be something like fuck me because thats a starsized red flag.,java,dej9nf7,2,t5_2qhd7
11049615,0,t3_5xln16,I agree with others intellij IDEA is superior to navigating classes in a large code base.,java,dekgdu1,2,t5_2qhd7
11055757,0,t1_del5agm,Well OK then. I like NetBeans too!,java,del5grp,0,t5_2qhd7
11057432,0,t1_delbo6p,gt You mean the laziness of doing proper separation of concerns and just do it the easy way?Haha. Thats not quite what I meant. Im more wondering when the cons outweigh the benefits  whether that is project size or something else..What do you think?,java,delcayy,6,t5_2qhd7
11068732,0,t3_5y24mg,No I dont think so.,java,demmpat,-8,t5_2qhd7
11125669,0,t1_det1w5s,Thats incorrect.        Type erasure was chosen in Java so that bytecode compiled with generics wouldnt break in . JREs. The language fundamentally didnt support it and so they sort of bolted it on to support it.         In the .NET world on the other hand they decided to make generics a breaking change in older CLR versions and this is why they were able to use reified types. In this sense it was not bolted on top.,java,det32rn,15,t5_2qhd7

11328442,0,t1_dfg1qb3,There are competing frameworks and all are working good. There is spring and there is javaEE. The two are very similar but in some kind different. If you want full stack options look at spring and javaEE. JavaEE also is implemented in different frameworks. JBoss is one of them. So spring gives you a real framework that you can use. JavaEE is just a standard that can be implemented and oracle will verify it. That said there are a handful of javaEE servers and frameworks. Just use one of them. And yes you need a applet server. But for microservices you can use an embedded one. ,java,dfg264w,2,t5_2qhd7
11333293,0,t1_dfgli6j,I understand. However I wouldnt use this approach at the end Im trying to get rid of writing the comparison still you have to provide the data somehow either you fetch it from your DB or having a mocked class.,java,dfglxux,1,t5_2qhd7
11337814,0,t1_dfh3ewr,Fair enough I may be overthinking this. I guess Ill try the app ouside Docker approach. I may have been traumatized by connectivity issues between things inout of Docker in the past thats why I may be reluctant to just map the services manually.Do you use anything to orchestrate your dependencies in dev Docker Compose or minikube? Or just manually docker run each dependency individually?,java,dfh4dvz,1,t5_2qhd7
11339890,0,t3_61u413,I think rjavahelp may be better suited to your needs.,java,dfhcuth,4,t5_2qhd7
11375658,0,t3_61qvp4,Laughed my ass of while spottedself.givefryingPan.getContents PERCENT  huehuehueDAlso very good article method tidiness is one of the major clean coding pillar good job!,java,dfletlx,1,t5_2qhd7
11384332,0,t1_dfm9kxk,Its experimental ATM. You can snoop around and find their artifacts but theres nothing beyond murmurings of an EAP coming soon in the Slack.,java,dfme7yg,5,t5_2qhd7
11394038,0,t1_dfn2qrp,So a binding via Java  C works faster with Googles tensorflow? And writing filters actions and transformation for Spark are so much faster written in Java than in Scala? Which frameworks for big data do you use for the C world? Imho the framework enables the true performance capabilities... scale out capabilities are much more important than pure performance of a process on one machine...,java,dfnhy3u,1,t5_2qhd7
11400167,0,t3_62k03v,Although I find FizzBuzz absurd I recommend you look it up as its about x easier to solve if youve solved it before.  ,java,dfo70fg,3,t5_2qhd7

11467664,0,t1_dfvuf7q,I am at the highest level as a desktop support at my company. The recruiter doesnt know how much I am making but she knows I will moving down  grade pay level for the entry level Java developer.I was thinking of giving a K base salary offer to the recruiter. Is that a reasonable salary range for negotiating? ,java,dfvuqew,11,t5_2qhd7

11528632,0,t1_dg2qosg,I hope so having to use special gradle builds have been the primary reason I havent started yet,java,dg2rtf3,-1,t5_2qhd7
11542736,0,t3_64phpf,Most of the rules seem common sense at least for experienced developers nobody will argue against them. However we can often see how some of them are violated on a daily basis even  on experienced teams. Good post.,java,dg4dcyy,1,t5_2qhd7
11545390,0,t1_dg4k3tq,Whats the value in mocking a static utils method? ,java,dg4o7cg,3,t5_2qhd7
11574918,0,t1_dg7zg9h,gt The Maven general rule is one primary artifact per POMThat is a good rule. But that has nothing to do with what you or OP said. You can have a project which consists of multiple modules POMs and each builds its own thing. Well thats how it works by default anyway.,java,dg80u7w,4,t5_2qhd7
11582051,0,t1_dg8tbt1,A c developer can forget to guard against a buffer overflow exploit. A java developer could not know that storing passwords in String objects is a bad idea. Its all the same. Developers have to avoid writing exploitable code in all languages.Java is beautiful. So I think your lecturer is lame and probably an inexperienced Java developer.,java,dg8tz20,6,t5_2qhd7

11627124,0,t3_65vwnp,Holy shit. I love you mang. Ive been working on a web interface to scan UPC codes to add new items to known. And allow you to either scan them in and out of the inventory compiling usage data in a table based on ingredients. Ive also made an interface for reporting symptoms in real time I.e. GI stuff pain headaches...etc. You scrible on a diagram of a body slide some sliders and it saves the data to a table. The plan is to marry the two and find correlations...posaibly find environmental contributors to chronic conditions or identify conditions with more precision and granularity. Nyeho...ive had nothing to manage the data with till now. U rock dude.,java,dgdy3ge,2,t5_2qhd7
11790873,0,t1_dgwiy7x,Not having to maintain and configure another external dependency.I remember stumbling upon a Glassfish bug where some JEE lib needed an update.I had to document all steps updating this lib in Glassfish to everyone.Otherwise a simple pom.xml update would have been enough...Its all JAR files anyways...,java,dgwj9y3,1,t5_2qhd7
11799686,0,t3_68cd9j,I started with Eclipse but that was before IntelliJ IDEA became popular. Its hard making a recommendation for beginners because I dont want to recommend Eclipse because its so bad but IDEA might be too difficult for beginners to understand. Ive never tried Netbeans so Im not sure how good it is for beginners but unqzero seems to think its a good one for beginners.,java,dgxj9w2,3,t5_2qhd7
