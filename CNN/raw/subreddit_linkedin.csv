5960667,0,t1_cy0dzb7,I think it makes sense to have your Projects under your Experience. In this way anyone looking at your profile sees the breadth of your Experience and Education and then they scroll to the next section and see the indepth examples of your work.Similar to if you were applying Cover Letter Summary Resume Education and Experience Writing samples Projects.,linkedin,cy0z2rt,1,t5_2qtyx
6465797,0,t3_446951,I went in and blocked all the people that couldnt know I was looking. Also turn off sending notifications to your network when you update your profile. I used something like interested in expanding my portfolio of online media or something like that in my summary. Basically something that says you want to grow your skills which your current employer should want too has been my method. May not be blunt enough for what you want though,linkedin,czo3x1r,3,t5_2qtyx

And I didnt know that the preffix will be changed as well. Im so sorry for being so silly but still... many thanks. Youve helped me. Have a nice day.,linkedin,d22e9ii,1,t5_2qtyx
7634152,0,t3_4jtz0p,Its all risk versus reward. Trade offs. Will this employer say bad things about you? Is what they say more damaging than a  year gap? Any other way to explain having relevant experience?One thing you can do is hire someone to make and record a reference check call with the old employer. It will give you more information.If you were really fired for a disability seek legal advice. A sternly worded letter from a lawyer may turn a bad reference into no reference or a totally neutral one.,linkedin,d39ym46,3,t5_2qtyx

10914122,0,t3_5vrbw8,I guess it depends on how many you have? If these open days are good for getting longer placements summeryear in industry etc... then I cant see any harm in having some within the employment section. But I wouldnt have more than  or . At the end of the day you need to show your best experience I have seen many banking undergrads list week long insights so not much difference. As a first year undergrad I guess this is a great start to a law career. Just go on the theory that once you have a couple of longer placementsexperience then Id remove them and focus on the longer more in depth experiences.. But whilst your looking for that experience sure add them. It shows recruiters that you have put yourself out there and are looking to gain professional experience though out your studies.Alternatively if youre worried about feeling desperate I dont think you should feel like that you could always add them under your current university in the education section.,linkedin,de5pq17,1,t5_2qtyx
