I was on my computer when the email got sent so I immediately replied and got an invite. A few friends bailed on me so I ended up going with my girl. While we were there in the eastern club level we noticed some people on the field. I approached a securityusher guy and inquired about how we get on the field. He said Just walk down there man! After I stopped squealing me and the better half took an elevator to the ground floor and walked on the field. Let me tell you its about the baddest thing ever. When it got dark the lights came on and that was also amazing. We sat in the south end zone near where my seats are and watched some of the draft then we did some running then we did the Oklahoma Drill on the  yard line I won. Then I tweaked my knee really badly playing catch with some guys in my defense I did come down with the ball in the corner of the end zone. All in all an experience I wont soon forget.

That one wasnt on Dalton but it probably hurt the team the worst that early.gtAs I mentioned in the pessimist thread our rushing defense is quietly ranked st in the NFL. It is the biggest worry for this team and yet again it goes unmentioned.I said that I wasnt making excuses about our inadequacies and it is your right to be pessimistic. However I find it foolish to give up with  games yet to be played and first place literally tied. I really dont know what you are trying to pick apart and I agree we should admit faults but the problem I have with posts like yours is that it hurts more than it helps.

However there have been differing interpretations of how this play should have actually been ruled and it has remained a controversial play for fans of both teams involved. The NFL amended its rules after the  season in order to prevent a recurrence of the play.gtgtImage iInteresting List of Oakland Raiders broadcasters | Dave Casper | Fumblerooski Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmnyyx oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmnyyx.

2557765,0,t3_2p0k6u,gtWhy Trade Dalton melted down earlier this season most notably in a  loss to the Browns during which he threw three interceptions and went just of for  yards. It hasnt been his only bad start. His teammates bailed him out during Week s win over Tampa Bay and theres still that public perception that Dalton cant win in prime time or in the playoffs most recently fueled by the  shellacking Daltons Bengals took from the Patriots in Week .This angers me. Daltons second half in the Buccaneers game was nearperfect. Factor out the bogus OPI call on Green and two drops and Daltons second half stat line was   yards  TD. And of course he threw up  times and didnt sleep the night before so I think that helps excuse his first half picks. Though no one outside of Cincinnati knowscares how sick he was. Then the Patriots game  Daltons . QB rating was higher than Bradys that game. What really killed the Bengals was  yards allowed by the defense and  fumbles lost by receivers in that game.What were we talking about? Oh yeah trading Dalton. Not going to happen. ,bengals,cmsfrib,19,t5_2rehg

3961795,0,t3_35sw4r,I think that if it was just about proving beyond a reasonable doubt that they knew about the balls there wouldnt be enough evidence for a  game suspension. But the commish based this off of the CBA which said that if they dont cooperate with an integrity of the game investigation its a suspension which whether hes guilty of tampering or not he didnt cooperate Brady not wanting to turn over his text messages as one example. Goodell also said after Spygate that if the Pats had another integrity of the game violation it would be considered a nd offense and they only have to prove its more likely than not for a guilty on that or  likely.  Given those conditions the penalty isnt extreme but of course if it happens to your team youre going to cry rape and Pats fans are like shitsburg in that they think their team can do no wrong. If it happened to the Bengals Id be upset but rules are rules and the penalty fits the crime as it stands now.

What if our young corners dont reach their potential?I fucking love the Bengals. I always have faith in them but I keep my expectations real. This year I think one or two games will be the difference between us being in the playoffs or not. We cant afford losing to the Browns. We cant afford missing a PAT to tie someone. With this schedule Im not even thinking about the Super Bowl. Im not even thinking about the first round playoff game. Im thinking we better beat the fucking Raiders to get off to a good start.

They were two separate injuries to two different body parts. He was unlucky. I followed him all of  preseason because he was one of my fantasy targets.Bryant was considered a gamble. His injury was known and wellpublicized. He had had knee surgery in the offseason and was still on the mend. Physicals get fudged pretty often. His signing was the result of toplevel mismanagement not a poor medical staff. That signing and the Jeanty signing both happened when Mike Brown was still acting as GM.

The NFLs current rule works for I would say  maybe even  of applicable situations but because it seems that the  are plays that matter they get scrutinized a lot. Is it a type of confirmation bias? Sure. Does it probably validate the fact that the NFL should try to deal with this problem I think so.,bengals,cvhnfia,1,t5_2rehg

Just sitting in front of it is feels like the optimal setup for gaming with the exception being racing games. I considered an eyefinity  nvidia surround setup with  monitors but if falls into the same cost realm and you have to deal with bevels. I also recommend against any eyefinity setup that doesnt use  identical displays. It seems like we are on the fringe of the next generation of ultrawides and we will begin seeing more hz IPS displays with gsync  freesync options. Every  curved monitor currently has IPS backlight bleed problems that seem to favor the bottom left corner but its only noticeable if I put up a black screen just to look for it. Ive also read that with the exception of a couple displays Samsung LSECNS and acer x Preditor they all use the same base panel thus the reason they all have the same issues. ,bengals,cxn9zxt,3,t5_2rehg

5937128,0,t3_3wp1gg,The season doesnt have to unravel now. The defense actually held Pittsburgh to a relatively low scoring day. Two scores came directly from a turnover by a quarterback playing the first relevant snaps of his career and that was with the heart of our secondary out. Just get to the playoffs and get to them healthy which is still a crapshoot and I have faith that this  version of the Bengals can make noise.

But the idea that people can qualify a players actions for a year without explanation just baffles me. These people dont know what jobs the players are supposed to do they dont have an idea of the footwork and handwork people have to do. They dont know what play is called where the focus is supposed to be what the coaches have been telling them. These people have never played football at anywhere near this level. Theyre basically just fans that watch a lot of football. So if they get it into their heads that somebody is bad instead of grading them neutrally they are going to start looking for reasons to take off points.

I think if McCarron does well in the preseason the team will pretty much have to trade him in order to get anything in return for him because he will price himself out of the Bengals market for a backup QB by the end of his rookie contract. ,bengals,czejx4q,2,t5_2rehg

Hes got all of the talent in the world but I think he falls because of the injury. Its not a clean comparison to Todd Gurley Gurleys injury happened  months earlier in the season compared to Smith and was a relatively simple tear by comparison. Any team that is able to draft him has to plan on not being able to play him until . Which is right up our alley. Give him time to recover fully get integrated into the locker room and system. My dream scenario is that we draft him. It doesnt matter what else happens the rest of the draft if we are able to get him I will need to call my doctor because I will have an erection that lasts longer than  hours.It sucks that Chao is the source on this because he doesnt exactly have a sterling background ,bengals,d0ely5k,7,t5_2rehg

How fucking bad is your bandwagon memory? Dude just got past his sophomore year and were calling for a fresh rookie to replace him? Do you really think the rookies going to be any better?Hardest offensive positions to transition to at a prolevel from college is line and QB. Hes going to need more time under his belt before he becomes completely solid. That and the fact that he hasnt even sniffed IR time while hes been with us makes me think yall are spoiled fans who try to overhype our team and cause problems. Trust in our FOs player strategy. They set us up on a plan to have a higher chance to succeed years from now than a marginally higher chance to succeed this year then bankrupt our future. Theres a reason why they havent made FA moves to get another Center.Also  PFF can go eat a dick theyre morally bankrupt and will cherry pick the fuck out of their stats to get views. Theyre not doing anything that hasnt been done before. You really think the positional coaches for every team dont film their own fucking practices and assign player grades based on what they see in the film room afterwards? When they and their assistants have way more information about the assignments in the play than the underpaid PFF recorder whose expertise and motives should absolutely be questioned  yes Ive seen their recruitment pages using bad camera angles from game pass will ever dream of?

I think their performance this week could be a preview of the rest of the year. As far as our other receivers we finally got to see Lafell last week. I was pleased I think he can capitalize on everyone focusing on Green and get some good production. I am also super excited about Tyler Boyd. I think he will come through with some big plays but outside of preseason we havent seen much.

9342580,0,t3_58gprg,I have absolutely nothing against the Bengals. While the hit on Bennet is certainly questionable and I can forgive that what he tried to do to Blount isnt forgivable for me. Please dont try and say there is no proof of what he was trying to do. He wasnt taking a step he was stomping. Sure we dont get to see contact ever actually happen but I have NEVER seen a player retaliate for somebody stepping near them in a pile. It happened. Admit it. He has the history. We have the footage.Anyways like I said. Nothing against the Bengals. It sucks that any player gets injured especially with how big of an impact Burfict has on the game when he is playing clean of the time. In an ideal world nobody would get injured at all and it would be a safe game while still being as violent as it is. I hope he decides to clean up his act and play with some honor because I would hate to see a team lose a player with that much raw talent to a suspension.And Burfict certainly has his good moments too. I recall seeing him helping Patriots players up several times during the game after making big tackles.

It could be scary having him and Burfict on the same field.My second pick would be Mike Williams. Brandon LaFell impressed me last year but were going to eventually have to find a younger  receiver. Cody Core also impressed me last year and he could potentially fill this  role. This is more of a dream pick if anything. I think our offense could be scary with Williams.

Minter is  and in the prime of his career Vinny Rey is  and still has plenty left in the tank. Then we have former rd rounder Nick Vigil who showed well was a rookie last season. Drafting Foster would essentially be giving up on him completely with no reason to do so then trying to thrust a square peg into a round hole by forcing Foster into a SAM or MIKE role which he is not suited for in the NFL.

I just think its foolish too throw out a bunch of stats of TE production against the Bengals defense excuse the offenses failures do to injuries and think that tells the whole story of the  season.TEs have shredded this defense for eons. Im well aware of it. Ive grown weary over the years of watching dinosaurs like Heath Miller get open at will and convert long rd downs. Pass rush is an even bigger issue. We dont blitz very much in this scheme so pressure is predicated on a  man rush. Our defensive line has become easy to defend as teams simply hold the shit out of Geno and double or chip Dunlap. MJ hasnt done much of anything since he got the franchise tag  years ago. Peko was a useless. Overall the defense is good though. They dont give up a ton of points. Bend but dont break very often. The offense let them down big time last year.The last stat you listed to me is the most telling th in points scored. The most important offensive statistic. If you cant put points on the board offensively it doesnt matter how good your defense is. Unless youre the  Ravens or recently the Broncos or Seahawks. The Bengals arent on that level. Nor will they reach that level with a st round pick. They wont be getting Von Miller Ray Lewis or Kam Chancellor at .The offensive line killed this team last season. The FO then saw it fit to let their two best lineman walk in FA. This will continue to be a huge issue for this football team. OL is not an option at . The next best solution would be to give Andy options to get the all out of his hands and stretch out defenses. Skill position depth is an issue outside of AJ and Eifert. The Bengals have relied on AJ to carry this unit for far too long. Eifert is an AllPro for his  games hes active a season. They cant afford to go into another season with these two being the only difference makers. Injuries are part of the game. Being unprepared depth wise is on the FO. FTR Im all for defense at  if the value is there. Solomon Thomas would be my top pick. However Im strongly against reaching on an edge rusher that could be available  picks later in lieu of taking an offensive weapon at .,bengals,dgf1aal,2,t5_2rehg
