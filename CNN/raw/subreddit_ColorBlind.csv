He might see green as grey or he might see it as bright green. Youll have to compare it to other greens to see how he perceives them. I had a single pair of socks with  grey stripes at the top for years. Apparently they were green stripes. I no longer have those socks. I got the color blindness and correction simulator android app. It does the closest match for me to what I see.  My daughter though peanut butter looked disgusting through it so I guess it works.

1419606,0,t3_2abhc2,Pastel Color Blindness!!!! MY FIRST FRIEND!!! One of the rare  of types of color blind. My doctor actually told me this Im not making it up often not found in definition beyond medical books because it later got categorized into one of the forms of redgreen. Essentially its harder to tell pastel differences Shades of colors Purples and Navy Blues and Blacks are hard as well as oranges reds and some greens. It is often similar to deutaranomal CVD. In older color blindness tests cards were designed with  numbers. Normal vision a red green number and a third number for the other  blindnesses. When a  is on the card RG people will often see a  normal vision will see a  but pastel and others see an  because they make out parts of the  but struggle differentiating other colors.I find it easiest to describe this way Normal visioned people can see about  hues of colors. RedGreen color blind people can only see approximately  hues. Pastel is like being able to see  hues. Its easy to slide by with  and never think something is wrong but once you realize it there is still a significant noticeable deficiency in determining hues. I can still  differentiate a red and a green but put  greens next to each other and they most likely look the same to me.EDIT I found this page  that helps explain it. The  pictures next toe ash other look the same to me however when someone pointed out the background was a different shade and the foreground was a different shade variants of green I struggled very hard to find a difference and could kind of see it but if it was just me I wouldnt have noticed it.,ColorBlind,ciu8532,4,t5_2qq1i

8134388,0,t3_4qfw1i,Visited Chicago in December of last year. Went to the museum and tried it on with my Mother an artist who is SUPER sensitive to colors and has amazing color vision. It was a gloomy cold winter day. They were pairs meant for outside with outdated s cool frames that I hated. Lighting inside was dim. The setup for the glasses being effective was working against me from the start. I could not leave the museum with them on because there were no outdoor exhibits and like I said it was totally dark gray and cold outside. Purples were much deeper but NOTHING very impressive or life shattering. They looked almost artificially deeper and tinted like in a Tim Burton movie. My mother agreed and said the glasses almost made the colors uglier and less natural thats the artist in her. Reds were pretty much unaffected oranges turned to red pinks turned to purple greens almost turned to teal! Like I said there was very little light and it was gloomy outside and I only had them on for  minutes. Too many big buildings in the way for me to try to look at stoplights from outside. There is a multicolored mural behind the front counter and the person who gave me the glasses that worked there said people are often shocked at how vibrant it is once they put it on. I said it already looked vibrant to me and pointed out all the colors to him. He said I got them all right! This is before I put on the glasses. Then I put them on and the hues were affected the way I described above. I need to try these glasses outdoors on a sunny day. Anyone in LA that can help?  ,ColorBlind,d4udnan,1,t5_2qq1i

Can you tell me how you write that very mild...protanomaly or deuteranomaly i cant see which one is it. Have you done colorblind check on android how did you score? I have kinda mild pronamaly and i score cbc about  points and severity  in average.  is perfect vision.I have nobody to compare to except my fammily and friends who all get  or  severity I think that is the best colorblind program so far cuz it changes brightness constantly.

9646770,0,t3_5d6e6j,Its not as big of a deal as you seem to be making it. Its small enough that there are many people that are unaware that theyre color deficient until theyve already lived most of their life. The amount of times color deficiency becomes a problem in everyday life is so few that a lot of your suggestions for changes seems excessive and coddling. The only thing that I can remember that would have actually helped me back when I was in school would have been crayons and colored pencils with the colors written on them. Also that traffic light is an exception not standard. Traffic light designs are already standardized. Im not sure what more you can do to standardize a standard.,ColorBlind,da25xek,12,t5_2qq1i
9649014,0,t3_5d6e6j,Just echoing here what has already been said it really isnt a big deal. And this is coming from a chemist in a field where color changes are important. Apps to help me identify colors exist so I really have no problem. If anything I think being colorblind is a blessing because sometimes I get surprised when Im told certain things look this way or another. I definitely wouldnt say this minor disability is at all comparable to most other disabilities in that they dont really affect our daily lives. Plus most of us havent known anything different so its not really like were missing anything.,ColorBlind,da2fvpi,4,t5_2qq1i

Did you know that you had to distinguish these colors in these specific situations initially and upon being hired? Does the main aspect of you succeeding in this position other than for safety reasons depend on accurately distinguishing colors  of the time? If the answer is no to the last question employers ethically should find reasonable accommodations for you. If it DOES require accuracy all the time then fuck they should have made sure you werent colorblind before hiring you. WTF is the matter with them? Get to the unemployment office STAT!,ColorBlind,db4kve2,2,t5_2qq1i

Last I heard CVD is not protected under ADA and if you happen to live in a righttowork state they might be able to fire you for any reason they want without any other recourse.That was the response I received when I was written up for a similar situation of my own no potential damage involved just a task I wasnt able to perform without accommodation.  Short version my boss wrote me up for what she thought was insubordination for my refusal to do a colorcoded job that was assigned to me.  When I complained to HR I was also told to get over it and to go take an art class to finally learn my colors.That was one of two equally ludicrous events that happened at that job in quick succession.  I chose to just quit and go find another job rather than press with any kind of legal action since it was obvious by then it was not a job Id be willing to keep.Good luck to you and let us all know how it turns out.,ColorBlind,dgp2sgb,4,t5_2qq1i
