8248452,0,t3_4s3656,So gutted to have missed that stream only found out about it after theyd finished. Did see the Periscope clip of their intro though and the sound mix on Bloodfeather sounded a bit patchy. Did it pick up during the set? Howd they do??,HighlySuspect,d58m1xk,2,t5_38h0i

10518417,0,t1_dcznanm,I think Viper Strike is hard to swallow but it is very personal.  They are stating their personal feelings something they feel very strongly about. I think a band starts to suck when they censor themselves because they are worried that they might offend people. Besides Viper Strike seems to be a shot at people who are racist and homophobic. The sad part is that it offends people. Lol. Its just saying dont be a complete dick and somehow that has set people off. Weird. And yeah they hate trump. And ur right a lot of people do. Especially intelligent musicians who write rock and pop. Its not edgy. If ur gonna get upset with evvvvery artist that stands up to him then you might just wanna settle for ted nugent for the next  years.,HighlySuspect,dd0djz5,4,t5_38h0i
10556565,0,t3_5r5olj,Stoked for the LA show. The Fonda is a pretty cool venue I saw IAMX there a couple of years ago. Fairly small.. but not as intimate as The Troubadour so Im a little bummed.. and the sound isnt as good. ,HighlySuspect,dd4pf88,2,t5_38h0i
