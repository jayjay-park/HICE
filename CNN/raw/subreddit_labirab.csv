2756286,0,t1_cnhd4nr,Numbers would have been good huh.  Power CleanBaseline   before you judge I usually purposefully stay away from themLow Point pre injury  High Point  For other lifts my back and front squat had increased  and lbs respectively from pre plan.  Log went up around  or lbs this is from memory and my deadlift had the biggest improvement with a lb increase.  I think thats mainly because I used a lot of deadlift variations instead of straight pulling so I got a lot of weak point work in as well.  What I enjoyed the most though is I was a lot faster on the moving events.  I can give more solid numbers in about a month once Im all healed up and back in the swing of lifting.,labirab,cnhdmlg,2,t5_31d72
