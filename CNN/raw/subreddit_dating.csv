24089,0,t3_1ueb1b,My advice here be yourself! Dont over think this. It sounds like you two really hit it off and she wants to see you as bad as you want to see her so ask her whenever you feel like it. Dont wait for perfect timing.

41724,0,t1_ceir7fj,A good direction to go in is to have an idea what you would like to do before you ask her out.

41773,0,t3_1uegzc,The vast majority of the time on date  or  Ill take the check and the girl will offer to split it with me. Ill just level with her and say Honestly Im in grad school and I cant keep paying for both of us but I invited you out and I want to do this for you tonight. How bout we talk about it again next time? followed by a sincere smile and eye contact. Shes usually happy to consider dinner a onetime gift and doesnt feel patronized and appreciates my honesty. Occasionally Ill take a girl out  or  times and she wont even ATTEMPT to offer to pay for a date. I keep my mouth closed but usually it works itself out because by the third date we prove to be incompatible in general. My insistence on paying the first few times is a gesture on my part that says thank you for spending your evening with me. If we get serious her insistence on splitting the check is a gesture that says Im with you for more than free stuff.,dating,cej6qi9,1,t5_2qhb1

She is definitely interviewing you but thats the point of a first dateto see if therell be a second.

2737758,0,t1_cnf7kgn,Thank you. Yeah Im talking to this guy right now and we met on a dating site so the interest is at least kinda mutual. He and I got super close and I let on that I have feelings. He accepted them well but for certain reasons beyond our control theres really no way we can be together even if he was interested in me like that. I usually text first thing in the morning with a good morning. We talk for a bit do our own thing then he would text me in the middle of the day andor we would do something together online at night. As far as the whole initiating goes I actually dont mind doing it. I usually text first etc. But sometimes I feel like it puts me at a disadvantage. Were all human I feel like sometimes its easy to take for granted of a person thats always there you know? I used to be more like your first GF. I was an Illdomyownthing type of person then I would just get together with my SO and that would be it. Then I guess to compensate for that I became more and more clingy. So Ive gone through the stages.

You goal should be to focus on yourself figure out what things make you happy and tackle the depression issue. Maybe consider seeing a therapist or someone who can help you professionally with your depression issues. Then find a hobby. Pick something youre interested and get really good at it. Then associate yourself with other people who also like that thing. Girls are attracted to guys who have confidence in themselves have interesting hobbies and dont give off a vibe of desperately wanting a girlfriend.

That ended really badly but it was also a really different situation. I hadnt known him before at all he was a notorious partyboy and he was incredibly selfinvolvedI dont think he wanted to hurt me but he just seemed incapable of thinking of how his actions affected me.My friend now is not like that at all so Id be more willing to try your suggestion.

College aged women are usually after one thing and that is fun. Those who can provide the most of it will get the most attention. Just wait until she has a slow day and just ask and see if she wants to hang out that night. This will shorten the likelihood of her finding other things to bail for. Also do something fun like hiking paintball whatever. The basic dinner and a movie is cliched and boring.

Some may not think your movie sounds like what they want to see so dont take it personally. Just dont make the invitation do you want to do something make it specific and on a specific day.

I think its a great way to really get to know someone. Friendship is a great start even if you are rejected you at least learn from the experience and gained a good friend.  For me when I tell a guy that I am attracted to that its nice that we can be friends for me that means its nice to have that bond where you have the trust to be honest with one another and share your thoughts. We tend to act a bit different when we are trying to date someone there is no trust and real honesty as you would have with a friend.

4395803,0,t3_3bbtha,The mere fact that you claim such success yet you get suckered by every single woman that enters your life screams bs to me. At  or more dames pr day you would eventually learn how to tell.The fact that you only list your financial success as a measuring stick for your values screams you have issues. I would say likely youre a trump character. You think your own shit doesnt stink and this combined with or defects make people unable to stand your personality for extended periods of time. Reflect on yourself. I realize these words appear harsh and cruel but if I am right then this is the only way to open your eyes to the truth no matter how much it hurts.If I am wrong you will simply ignore me. And a Rage back at me will simply prove my point. If I were you I would start by telling me how you grew up what went wrong with the marriage and what things you consider romantic. How do you treat a partner as an equal? How do you show respect to someone that havent achieved success?I will bet you will find answers somewhere in these questions to why they consider you a stop and hop. Most people will eventually feel bad for taking advantage of someone.Unless they perceive that someone as a major asshole.And it sounds like a lot of woman dont mind abusing your hospitality for extended periods of time.This screams asshole to me.

4406558,0,t3_3bgu1q,A bit very drunk so this post is going to be out of left field.    I read once that every relationship hinges on what you get from the other person.     Sounds harsh but its true.So instead of focusing on yourself and thinking about school and transitioning etc focus on what you offer as a partner that people youre interested in want.    You mentioned youre attractive and affectionate.    Great start so what else?   Be interesting funny have hobbies low maintenance exciting...  etc etc what we all want in a partner.Then I suppose...   internet dating has been the best bet for me and I think for you too.  You can instantly disclose your MTF doober and not waste any time though I imagine youll get a fair few fetishists which can be good or bad.    GL amp HF Morrigan lady.,dating,csmcqhe,1,t5_2qhb1

4469663,0,t3_3ca2vs,Start organizing stuff.  A lot of places have specific days that they are betterfunner than others. Example  if its Thursday know a few places that have great happy hour specials that evening so if you feel like going out you can send out a text to a bunch of people and get a group together.  The more you organize the more friends youll make.  This will also make it easier to date because you can casually invite a girl to a happy hour and if she flakes you still have friends to have fun with if she does show be sure to give her attention. ,dating,csu2qek,1,t5_2qhb1

She like you has a life outside of her dating life. Sometimes that can be overwhelming. You gotta respect that. If what shes available to give you doesnt work for you look somewhere else. . Its better to be specific about plans to go out. Instead of are you busy this week? suggest an activity and a time. Even if she cant make it if she wants to see you shell suggest better options.

4524847,0,t3_3d1icn,Dating is a game of numbers. Its absolutely true you have to keep trying. Dont beat yourself over failing because then you will over focus on things that could go wrong. I found it when it came to dating for me when I started and Ill tell ya I started late . The two most important lesson I learned are as followed.Lesson  Although a  parter lesson one is Dont fear rejection and dont put individuals on a pedestal. After I got over that I just went in with an open mind. Worst thing the individual could do is say no. Go after anyone that you believe has the characteristics that you look for in a potential date. Some of my most memorable dates were with girls who I thought were out of my league and would reject me of the bat. Although I didnt end up with them in long term relationships it boosted my confidence knowing that hey I do have something to offer.Lesson  Not everyone will reciprocate the feelings you might have for them after a few dates it takes time. Remember were all looking for someone special the end game is finding someone who you like and someone who likes you for you. In the end there is nothing wrong with you and the universe is not cockblocking you. Just have to keep on trying.,dating,ct0zurj,5,t5_2qhb1

4727731,0,t1_ctqg2t5,okwellthatwasweird Well I could still argue that  texts was too much and not really necessary. If you knew he was leaving then you could have just said let me know when you get back and left it at that. I also wouldnt try to make specific plans with him for after he gets back while hes currently away. Hes working right now let him be. Whenever he gets back then you see if he gets in touch and then you can arrange a new date. That being said I do generally consider it somewhat rude to not reply in a timely fashion. But I guess with the type of work he does his schedule for something like this isnt locked down its possible thats why he didnt reply immediately when he got your text because he was waiting until he had a better answer. Or not. I dont know. I wouldnt recommend jumping to any conclusions good or bad right now. Again just leave it. See how things are when he returns.,dating,ctqgyos,1,t5_2qhb1

I get it if a guy wants to get coffee or a drink Im thinking hes just looking to talk on a nonserious level. That being said I feel like if something i.e. life comes up it shouldnt be a big deal to reschedule or reconnect down the line.However the rescheduling i.e. flaking seems to be eating at you. Maybe you could be more direct about what these meetings mean for you. Perhaps you could straight up tell her that you want to make date plans and dear God please say the actual word date. In your OP you used date and get a drink interchangeably. This is quite telling as it says to me that you and your potentials have not clearly defined what this meeting is about. To me it sounds like getting a drink is your way of finding a potential longterm relationship. Otherwise Id imagine it would be easier for you to move on. However keeping it too casual as you have been doing has made it easier for these potentials to move you around their schedules. I feel like the line needs to be drawn and clearly defined. This is so that she cant play dumb or act as if she didnt know you were interested as some do. You could possibly risk more upfront rejections but this could help you save time and frustration seperating the wheat from the chaff is that the right saying? IDK.I say all of this because I am the girl that flakes. I have this thing about men who do not want anything serious yet want my time especially since I am now looking for a longterm relationship. As a person with two jobs and a family business obligation I seldom have time for coffee chats and I only go out with guys who truly have my undivided attention and interest. I make time for the guys who say lets go on a date at the park potential longterm relationship but rarely the ones who want to get a beer hookupshortterm. I realize that not every bar meeting means hookup and that not every date leads to LTR but for me these two kinds of encounters communicate two different vibes. But please if anything do not put it on the potential to try and figure out what you want from her.At the end of the day dont let it get you down. Maybe instead of asking girls out for drinks maybe meet a lady while she is already out getting a drink flaking problem solved. BUT if you feel like calling it a date would run a lady off its likely youre getting too serious too soon or that shes simply not for you. And only one of those things are within your control. I wouldnt worry. Now find some chill and get back out there  Good luck!,dating,cxa03zt,3,t5_2qhb1

No more problems.You can expect them to be sleeping with other guys if theyre on these sites and you need to put your bid in so to speak if you want to be even a blip on their radar. Its emotionally hard to weigh one partners compatibility over another when sex is involved.gtI asked to kiss her on the cheek.gtI wasnt sexually aggressive enough.This is a theme. Im  so in a different age bracket but I begin touching her not inappropriately but a highfive or even a handshake nearly as soon as the date starts. When I kiss them I just go for it. More physically dominant and aggressive as the other person ITT says is what you want.PS As for the actual format of your dates sitting sidebyside say at the bar is a much more comfortable way to build a rapport because you dont have the interview feel of sitting across from each other you get at a dinner date.,dating,d0i4fpj,-1,t5_2qhb1

7063020,0,t1_d1gwyne,Really long sorry.I guess it is just where I live and how I grew up. I would be willing to make compromises and have a real relationship god knows I would love to be in a real relationship. No one is perfect I understand. I am not perfect FAR from it. However I have on a very few occasions met a woman I thought was actually worth getting to know.I went to a public school my whole life where being white was a minority yes this made a difference. The things that I guess the culture of where I live value are things I simply do not like for example I could not care less about the sports teams of my state or any state really I just do not care about sports. I believe there are amazing women out there I really do! I have just had such a completely terrible experience with so many women and I have tried going to so many different places doing different things online dating whatever and I never find anyone that leaves me wanting more. No its not that I think all women are whores sorry if I came off that way.Give me a woman that has some interests that I do can actually hold a conversation who I come home from hanging out with fighting myself on how long I should wait to text her because all I want to do is talk to her more and I would be more then willing to potentially change the person I am to be a better boyfriend for her. I have yet to find a woman like this and while  is not really old as work continues to take up more and more of my time I just see myself slowly becoming a lonely person and it scares the shit out of me.,dating,d1gydbt,1,t5_2qhb1

7153430,0,t3_4ddhua,Lets step through the question in a slightly different way and then I think youll have a pretty easy time of deciding how to proceed.Heres what we know.... At the very minimum shes flirty with you and shes okay sleeping over in your bed all while she has a boyfriend  one who she actively ignores while doing this.  Therefore if she were to eventually ditch this guy and get serious with you you would have to always keep in mind that shes capable of doing this without remorse so shell probably do it to you too.. She has let you know that she has a boyfriend yet still made these moves with you and seems to indicate a desire or willingness to go farther. This means you now have an implicit agreement that you are okay being her sidepiece.  Which isnt necessarily all bad but you should use protection.. You dont want to fight some dude but youre comfortable sending texts and snapchats so if hes the kind of person who snoops its entirely possible that he already knows who you are and plenty about you.. Everything youve done with this chick has involved heavy use of alcohol which makes it a completely deniable and nonserious and b possible grounds for a rape accusation so be very careful about how you proceed.Bottom line  Dont dream of dating her seriously and especially not in any way that involves her leaving her boyfriend for you.  But if you want to keep messing around she seems to be game and you could probably have a fun little fuck buddy... just be careful enough that the first time you do have sex you should do it before shes drunk enough to be unable to give consent.  After the first time your worries are over.,dating,d1r9vax,1,t5_2qhb1

I dont have ptosis but I do have a fairly noticeable case of lazy eye that causes me to look like Im not looking at a person when I am looking at them. I also have problems keeping eye contact in conversation simply because it gets exhausting for me to keep looking at moving objects peoples faces are esp bad for this since facial twitches are inevitable and I notice... that being said as someone who is insecure about this Ive noticed that the best way to handle it is to be upfront.

Or if we decided to test girls before giving them a chance which really doesnt happen. I totally understand that historically its the girl who has the upper hand because of competition among men pretty girls always have a possible guy waiting somewhere etc. but why is it that a girls intrinsic value is always just understood and accepted while a guy has to consistently demonstrate that hes of good quality?Maybe we are feeding into this by allowing girls to run their tests or games on us? Ive begun to adopt the mindset that a girl who wants to play games is not the right one for me I just dont have the time and mentalemotionalphysical energy to keep wondering WTF she wants. Im a little older now  and while Im not feeling like I have one foot in the grave I am feeling like time is becoming more important and Im trying to find the right one now not just the one for right now.Also I get that youre nervous about letting whatever youve built so far crumble away but if shes also into you shell give you the opportunity again.

The key from what Ive seen from friendsfamily with kids who reentered the dating scene is to put your energy into expanding your social circle more so than trying to simply get dates. The more friends you have the greater chance you have of meeting a single women who will not write you off simply because you are a father.For how to do this try to meet other parents with kids in the similar age ranges and host a cookout or something for everyone to attend.When your ex has the kids if the situation allows go out with coworkersfriends. Use every chance you get to meet new people and you will meet someone in time. It wont be instantaneous like online dating promises to be but willEasier said than done of course and the particulars will change depending on wherehow you live but at least this way you can have some fun and be a solid dad along with meeting new people and potential partners.,dating,d493ycr,1,t5_2qhb1

8095232,0,t1_d4pn7g1,The blog and starting to learn armenian I feel like isnt a waste at all if it gets me another chance. I understand learning armenian is pretty much useless if I never see her again but its only a week of learning. Ill probably send it to her on Thursday or Friday. So I do think her father was playing hard. Because there were a couple things in the conversation that I didnt mention in the original post. There were two sections to this call. The beginning angry threats and defensive shit. And then I realized that wasnt going anywhere so I slowed things down and said how I felt. And after that he calmed down and said things like Youre both young and youll find other people. I hope that you find someone that loves you too. But there was also something that I think he said in the middle before the calm down that I still remember. Its not my decision. Now his english wasnt perfect so I doubt it was a premeditated sentence that was meant to be Yes Im still trying to lie and make it seem like shes making this decision.My bet is that after four years of her NEVER talking to anyone about our relationship... she had nobody to go to at any point for advice... that when she did tell them it came out like an waterfall of concerns and not a waterfall of love. And between me and her she wasnt very good at expressing her honest emotions. It wouldnt surprise me if there was something I was asking her like to spend the night at my place not sexually that had her worried for a reason that I dont know. And so while I assumed she wanted to do that because she never communicated otherwise maybe she didnt and so instead of this being tell your parents about this guy you love it was sort of venting and getting things off her chest. And then... her parents not being psychological masters not saying I am. Its taken me a week to come up with this... didnt realize that thats what was going on and just saw it as look at what he is doing to you? He cant be good for you. Let us protect you and cut him off for good. Which I understand if at this point you are thinking I should forget about her. But I cant. In my mind that series of events isnt an acceptable means to just walk away from this.Did she tell them about how when she falls asleep she has a pillow that she hugs and pretends its me? Probably not. Did she tell them that her most comfortable place to be is hugging me with her head tucked into the corner of my neck and shoulder? Probably not. OR that the  roses she got on her birthday last year werent from her office... thats ridiculous... they were from me. And so this blog is going to show her that once the dust settles that Im still there. And Im staying strong and not giving up. I said in the last post that it was going to remind her of the good times or whatever. Thats not true. I feel like that is tricking someone of getting back in a relationship with you. Im making it in a way to show what could be. Her helping me learn armenian. The moments Ive had this past week that I wanted to share with her but couldnt. Im adding audio clips and maybe video. She loves ME. The stupid vernacular I have. My subconscious tendency to be sarcastic when Im insecure. And so if I just let the blog be me... I think I have a shot.This all being said... I am prepared to let it go. Im not some crazy person who cant move on when someone says I dont want to be with you. I know that it sort of seems like that but I think this is a unique situation that allows for me to give more push to make things work out. If she calls me after reading it or at some point and says I love you but here are the reasons why it cant work. I think its best if we try and go our separate ways because well always have feelings and blah blah blah... Yes essentially Ill feel like I got kicked in the nuts again. But I will take it and know that at least I tried. And hopefully at least Ill know what happened. It wasnt like I got rid of all my friends when I met her. I never really had friends that I could actually trust growing up. I thought I did but it always fucked me later. Shes the first person Ive met that is there for me  and understands me . How could I just let that go in these circumstances? Armenian is proving insanely hard to learn.

You could be honest and say that you arent ready to date and if he respects you as a person then he will respect your decision.Personally I tend to be a bit blunt about this kind of stuff.

And she resents us both for her own lack of willpower.Maybe I was a bit pushy asking  times i an hour long make out but I would have respected a NO.

8621099,0,t1_d6i9mdf,Pretty much every country either has their shit together or is completely broken and people accept it while ours is east its self away from inside out using things like media and politics. The big deals now were not big deals a couple years ago. Our work culture has gotten very lazy. Most think they should get paid to sit at home and drink beer rather than even look for a job. There are still places that prefer quality over quantity such as where I work. Perfection isnt perfect enough. I love it. That and I almost halved by hours worked at a side effect of more than halving my income but more than doubled the quality of life. So worth it. Sleeping at night is about the most awesome thing ever. Im  and worked more than  hours of overtime last year the average  hour work week is something like  hours in a year. Like you I find it hard to meet those my age. I have zero interest in bars hate them have no interest in being around a college campus finally done what that work with older engineers literally half of them went to the school I did and work at a place that highly discourages relationships with other employees to the point of they will not even hire your SO for any position. I also find mentioning engineer means ghosted but that might just be my area. That makes it harder. Like you I have plenty of hobbies but they are usually expensive truckscars motor cycles technology lead and machined steel RC racing and cycling and more. I prefer isolation to subdivision. Lived over an hour from my highschool and about  miles outside of a town of  people. Loved it but literally knew no one at school or in my town. I hate the fact I can see my neighbors house in the duplex I live in now. This kind of isolation for sure didnt help. I commend you on your business. It takes a lot of work and a ton of courage.

9005172,0,t1_d7u9u44,Harsh lol but true. It is crazy to me and I think youre right about her own insecurities thing. She once cheated on me with a mutual friend a mutual friend that was engaged and getting married in less than  months. The best part is she completely cut him off from our lives after we argued and got back together a few months after. But one of her friends has been telling me all the little details about her and that shes friends with this guy again and hes even married now. Its completely mind blowing that someone can tear apart a marriage and continues to be in their lives. Its as if she actually enjoys ruining everyones lives around her. I secretly hope they get caught just so shell be known as the whore that broke up their marriage. But in actuality I couldnt care less about it. The real sad part about it is the guy is some old overweight Asian bald guy Ive shown pictures of him to my friends and theyve all been absolutely disgusted by him. Thats the type of guys she decided to lose me over and the type of guy to ruin a marriage over. Its a shame really. Im sure theyve been hooking up again which I find hilarious. But the best thing is a handful of her friends have been very flirty with me even trying to come over late at night to watch a movie. Ive been a gentleman and have always said no because as much as I dislike my ex sleeping with her friends seems like a complete dick move. But at this point I might take them up on the offer. Plus one of them is hot as hell and she is constantly asking me to take her out for drinks and to randomly hang out at  in the morning sounds like a fun night to me.

9014515,0,t3_53oe5x,Honestly it sounds like having A introduce you to B would give you the best of both worlds.  A already knows you like B so theres no point feeling any kind of embarrassment about liking someone you dont know. The pluses for you are that most guys are receptive to learning that a girl is interested in them which means you will likely only increase or at least pique Bs interest in you by him finding out you like him.  The other good thing is that since A will do the talking for you its kind of like you get credit for making the first move without actually doing it.  Extra bonus is that your friend A WILL talk you up to B.  If he didnt plan to do he wouldnt have offered.  Also if he knew beyond a doubt that you didnt stand a chance with B he wouldnt have offered to help in the first place.If you do get rejected or things dont go well with B just know that means he wasnt for you and it isnt a reflection on whether or not you were worthy of him.  If anything itll just help you narrow your search all while giving you a chance to be brave and take the first step!

Gaming culture is horrible to women which is why Im not surprised so few talk about it.

You can go beyond the photos on social media and dig through her personal collection.  What you want to keep an eye on are photos withof the same person you can probably ignore celebrities with relative frequency in the same time period.  That implies a relationship.  Also go drinking with her close friends and family youd be surprised what people will tell you with a bit of gin.  Finally if youre not too worried about intrusiveness you can always load spyware onto phonestabletscomputers and monitor communications.  Be sure to do this after spending a night reminiscing about the past.  If there is anyone she still cares even moderately about shell be likely to contact them after.  Keep in mind however that you will be unlikely to know the true number as girls often dont count one night stands.

9748568,0,t3_5ermo7,Dating is hard maybe you should give up. Here is what I suggest you do instead. Do things that get you social stuff that interests you or something that you care about. You sound like you may already have some so invest in that especially if it gets you around a diverse group. Then just ride the wave hang out get to know folks. Diversity and expand your circle of friends and acquaintances. Do not mope and for the love of god dont make disparaging comments or be negative about being single. Just have fun enjoy life and the freedom you have. Youll get a lady if you do this perhaps sooner than you think. Why? Because modern dating is an artificial way to get to know someone. Folks ghost because they are unsure or have little to no emotional investment or they are socially awkward and dont know how to tell the truth. Getting to know more people will make folks invested emotionally in you and one of two things can happen. You will meet someone and develop a connection before dating. This is not the friend zone Im talking about mutual attraction that can happen in the first couple of meetings before you ask her out always be clear with your intentions. If she hangs out with you in a group before the date she will kinda know you and feel more comfortable. It lessens the chance of ghosting but doesnt guarantee a date will go well or that you will be a match. The other thing that can happen is friends you make can vouch for you say youre a good catch. They can also help you meet people who may make good relationships. All in all  has been a shit year for a lot of folks. You are very young and its not a bad thing to be single just dont get bent about it. Go out there and be open to whatever happens. Have fun you wont be single forever.

Youll just have to try making that first step and being very friendly. Are you as attractive as you think objectively? Not saying this to be rude.

But the second time she saw me and messaged me about it I was probably way too cold.So what would you recommend? Wait for her to message me and ask her out after few texts if she doesnt bring it up herself?

Replace them with SelfEmpowering and SelfValidating Beliefs. Step  Identify your fears of failure and rejection and work to demolish them. Failure and rejection with women cant actually hurt you except if you believe that it somehow should. Get your ego out of it.Stop giving a damn about what random strangers think about you. It doesnt matter. If any particular woman doesnt have a good opinion of you you are under no obligation to deal with her ever again. Women even single women arent nearly as rare as you think they are.Step  dating will always be a numbers game especially for a man.The more women you approach get to know flirt with and ask for numbers from the more successful youll be.

10408931,0,t3_5p18u6,Ill tell you a thing as a lady  years older. For some the games never stop. There is no age where we all pass and become mature. Some folks never mature beyond the drama you recall from high school. For many that insane bullshit tiresome drama is what they feel they need. Its exciting it shakes things up. They think they need it and if the drama isnt there then something must be wrong. Some people create drama needlessly in their relationships because the lack of it makes them so uncomfortable. Watch out for those folks. Relationships that are drama prone dont last and are rarely pleasant. Ok so that out of the way No not everyone is game playing drama prone folk looking to get laid but many are. You have no control over that. However you can be crystal about your own wants needs and expectations. I wouldnt suggest being agressive about it nobody wants to be presented with a laundry list of demands when getting to know someone. Just be forward about not looking to get laid but instead are looking for someone to get to know spend time with and date. Doesnt mean sex is off the table just not gonna happen right away. You arent looking for instant gratification. I would suggest not trying to hard on dating sites and such those seem to propagate the hookup culture you may be running into. I would instead suggest getting active in your community and make friends through those interests you have. Some folks you meet may be single or know someone who may be single and right for you. Building any kind of relationship takes time and you never know where you might meet someone but if you meet someone outside of places where people hook up you are more likely to find a relationship where folks are looking to build on vs hook up.Its kinda like going to eat at the mall. You can go to the food court and get instant food that will fill you but it may be greasy or have been put under a heat lamp yeah its food but its not the greatest... or go to that sit down restaurant. Youll have to wait longer invest more but the food will be much better. So be clear with what your wants and expectations are and look for likely dating folk outside of hookup places and be patient. We all gotta weed through shit before landing on something that works. You cant control if other folks are drama prone and play games only person you have control over is you. You dont have to play games or tolerate those who do. Meanwhile enjoy your life have fun being single and get involved in things you enjoy. Good Luck,dating,dcnx4t5,6,t5_2qhb1

10713073,0,t3_5t7yoe,girls like confidence they dont like needy wishy washy unassertive men.  In shortgt  I treat women just like how I would treat a friend...maybe thats my problem. Im not stepping things up?this is a good way to meet friends.  thats cool if thats what you want.The deal with identifying girls to date or get laid is that you have to put yourself out there and accept rejection as inevitable and get over it and do it again.   I mean making a move not talking about your feelings with them.  Women prefer action over chat when looking for a loverboyfriend.  It seems that you have the friend thing down so well that it is all you know.  You have to be able to change into your hunter clothes if you want to get laid.  By rejection I dont mean she doesnt return you txt msg after three months of wishy washy does he want me as a gf or a friend ..??? I dunno because we hang out and he doesnt try to kiss me all I am getting is mixed messages!?!?You have to a plan a date.  B on date plan date  C On date kiss her not on the cheek KISS HER.  You have to let a girl KNOW you are into her sexually.  Its pretty straight forward.  If she isnt ?  WGAF???  Ask more girls out    Even if she IS into you still ask more girls out.  ,dating,ddkz1xi,5,t5_2qhb1

Sometimes we come off a certain way without meaning to. I cant tell you how many times Ive met people with offputting personalities that dont realize theyre rubbing others the wrong way. Not implying that youre off putting but you get what I mean.I have a coworker who has a habit of being loud and going off on a tangent. She doesnt realize this about herself and as a result drives them away. Another coworker of mine is a really nicefriendly person but has a tendency to get clingy and follow people around. Also offputting. I have one of those restingbitchfaces when im thinkingfocused so ive had people tell me that they thought I was a bitch for it.Theres a saying that goes....We judge ourselves by our intentions but judge others by their actions.I wouldnt give up until youve actually tried to figure out whatever is causing people to misread you or lose interest.Also what terrible friends you have that would go for your ex gfs!!   ,dating,ddxcb31,2,t5_2qhb1

11034734,0,t1_deilvcu,You failed to mention the distance factor in the OP.  This definitely changes the air of how youve been dating.You need to ask yourself what you want from this guy.  More dates?  Deep conversation?  Cuddling?  Sex?  If all you want to do is see him more often its pretty simple.   kilometers isnt awful maybe a date once every two weeks or so some sooner some later.  Just tell him you want to get together again soon and take the initiative on when you want to.  Next weekend?  Tomorrow?  Sometime during the week?  Work it out with him.  Find a hole in both of your schedules and meet up.  If the spark is still there you can communicate during the date that you want to do these things more often.  Express how often youd ideally like to.  Just be forthcoming with what you want.  We simple men are in fact really this dense and really this simple.  When it comes to these things we pretty much just dont know what were doing.These types of conversations especially when having doubts are always done best facetoface.  This makes reactions from both people totally candid and facial expressions and tone can be conveyed correctly.  A statement as simple as I guess can take a ton of different meanings when behind text from apathy to agreement  but theres no denial of what this means when talking in person.And if you want to go further?  Just go there.  As I said nobodys going to judge what you want unless theyre just a jerk in which case it ends up saving you a ton of time to know to dump them sooner.  Happy relationships are open and honest and youll never get there if you dont open up and start being honest with your other half.  Its a giveandtake of desire and compassion.  If you have needs you both should be comfortable fulfilling them.  The same is said on the flipside.  Its when these dont align and theres no room for compromise that things dont work.  But you wont ever know that until you try.  Most people dont try until its too lateafter marriage and its why so many marriages these days fail.So yea if you want things to get more serious because you like the guy just put forth the effort to meet up again to tell him that.  And if hes not willing to make that km commute when he cankeeps putting it off with crap reasons then you know it inherently just isnt going to work.  But thats still the result of you trying.,dating,deirg6e,1,t5_2qhb1

I used to suggest to the guys I was talking to to go after other pretty girls in attempt to see if they were interested in me or not. As bad as it sounds I was in a way testing them.If shes like the majority of the female population shell want the guy to make the first move... that means grow a pair buddy. If you take a step forward and make some sort of first move shell either love it or hate it. And if shes really not into you and lets it affect your guys friendship then shes also not a very good friend to begin with. Honestly I think you have nothing left to lose and to just go for it.

And I think men have high standards too! They want someone thin and athletic who can also somehow drink beer eat fried food and pizza without doing unfeminine workouts like Crossfit or weights. Some men  not all  have this standard. I think it comes down to the fact that people have a hard time articulating what they are looking for in a mate so they find these generalizations to try to narrow down the selection and because its social media it can come across as crass entitled presumptuous and defensive. I really loved the book Modern Romance by Aziz Ansari. And honestly when I did online dating the amount of sleazeball replies I got turned me off from replying to any of the replies even the ones from nice guys. And some not all women use online dating for an ego boost especially the swipe right app. Its like a game.Because even getting a coffee or a drink can sound like a scheme to just hook up maybe be a little more specific and detailed and innocent. It may work or it may not but something like I am here to make a real connection with someone. If the conversation is flowing after some exchanges meeting in person seems like the next logical step. It would be my pleasure to meet on a sunny Saturday afternoon where we can get the citys best muffins  eat ice cream  go to the dog park  check out an art exhibit.Be specific paint a picture and make sure that its not about sex.

You got anxious and didnt talk to her...so fucking what? Very few guys are that smoothgirltalkerjock that you picture in your mind. Second of all by not talking to her and by just keeping on catching her eyes you probably upped her interest in you if you see her again.

I know its incredibly difficult and you probably wont but youll realize one day after youve invested so much more emotionally how poorly shes treating you and itll be that much more devastating in the long run. Cut your losses. Believe me there are girls out there who wont string you along arent codependent on their unhealthy relationship and wont cheat. ,dating,dgozpg1,2,t5_2qhb1

11799270,0,t3_68b3ud,Never put your dick in crazy.Best you can do is just please tell her to stop and just assure her shell find someone else.  Offer a shoulder to cry on if she needs it but say youre really just not interested.  If shes doing it just for a relationship and youre adamant that youre not interested shell stop.  Had a similar experience with someone who fatfished me and proved to be crazy on the first date who just carried on about how shitty her life was.  Continued to get texts pretty much just admitting to having massive depression that she refused to get help with and roommate drama to boot.  Told her I didnt think I was interested.  Got a latenight text literally saying WHY WONT YOU LOVE ME?  Told her if she needs support to get past her issues Ill be there for her to move on but that I wasnt interested in a romantic relationship with the person she wasis from what shes going through.  Told me she just wanted someone to love her as she was.  Sounds kinda similar to your case.  Havent heard from her since. Hopefully you went to her place rather than yours and she doesnt know where you live.  Otherwise keep your doors locked lol.,dating,dgxhkq8,2,t5_2qhb1
