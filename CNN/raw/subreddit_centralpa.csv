862270,0,t3_23zzio,Byberry was demolished in .  Pennhurst was turned into an amusement park sort of house of horrors.  There are the twin tunnels in Downingtown.  Toad Road and the  Gates of Hell in York.  Theres a section of abandoned Turnpike that has two lengthy tunnels.  Mount Moriah cemetery in Philly is cool but its run by a friends group now and isnt properly abandoned although still quite wild.  A quick google turned up  which seems interesting if you care to troll through it all.  ,centralpa,ch2ange,5,t5_2qygz

972610,0,t1_chetxxp,Ahhhh.... Ok lets start with some back story.... About  miles away is a city named williamsport. In  williamsport got a brilliant idea.  Until this team it was a beautiful city nice downtown etcetera.  It had one issue its tax revenue wasnt enough to sustain itself...What should a city like williamsport do raise taxes?  Nope they took a large sum of money from Philly and literally bused in their homeless convicts people with aids remember this is  and people that got arrested for violence and selling drugs. Kinda reminds you of the Australian prison colonies doesnt it?Now unlike Australia these individuals werent surrounded by water so all their drugs just moved to a virtually clean area. Drugs gang warfare thats what I call it when there is an average of  a weekend for a rural area and turned it into the part of the state that has the highest crime index stats  on top of that before this time it was difficult to even get weed in some places around williamsport now half the rural populations teens have done heroine. The reason your neighbors are Leary of you is because a city mins from you got greedy and fucked a huge portion of the state. Dont believe me just google police news from williamsport... Its depressing. I personally live the same distance as you just the other direction. Dont take it personal be friendly and helpful get involved with the community and DONT play your music loud  throw keggers. If someone in the neighborhood needs help knock people over to be first in line. The locals may be difficult to get through to but once you do they are loyal and good people. I have lived in pa a long long time since before all this started but as an outsider myself Ive noticed exactly what you are talking about. here is an article from Phillys newspaper about it,centralpa,cheufhx,3,t5_2qygz

Hes just stating facts that there is a racial and class divide between the East Shore and West Shore.  That impacts how the city operates and how the two areas relate to one another which is something to keep in mind.I dont exactly love the Mayor but you appear to be reading a lot into a simple but uncomfortable statement of fact.,centralpa,d5h5wma,3,t5_2qygz
