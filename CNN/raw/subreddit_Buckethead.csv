1026130,0,t1_chkgkww,I dont know if I find it easier now a lot of them have titles and names. I remember when  and  came out they were untitled and they stayed that way in my head. I had a lot more freedom with the songs and I literally knew nothing about them other than how they sounded. Now  one of my favourites of the entire Pikes series is The Boiling Pond and its nice that it looks like a regular album but I miss the mystery. This is probably why Im still so fond of ISOT  while its still so massive and immersive theres a lot of intrigue.,Buckethead,chkxe6j,1,t5_2skqu
