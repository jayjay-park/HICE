533894,0,t3_1zhzl4,When I was married I would actually get upset if my ex dated someone that I found to be UNattractive.  I liked to think of him being away from me with someone who was super hot it made things more enjoyable.  In my current relationships one of my metamours is a guy so it is a nonissue there.  Other relationship well I am pretty sure my boyfriend has a type.  My metamour and I have the same hair color and are within an inch of the same height and within  pounds on weight.  Its fun because we can share clothes and dress each other up for outings.  On the flip side though she is older than I am and can get insecure about that.  I just tell her she does yoga and has nicer boobs than me then I end up making her laugh by trying to get her to let me touch her boobs.  Shes straight and she never does but for some reason finds that hilarious.,bipoly,cg0yl8k,2,t5_30air
