10994909,0,t3_5x0c60,Hello there! This is my first attempt at sapping and I unfortunately didnt look at the tree when it had leaves. I know to look for paired buds but this is a tree that has no branches until about  feet up so it is difficult to tell. I thought i remembered reading somewhere to look for whitishbluish dots on the bark?As soon as i tapped it clear sap started coming out. Is there a taste test that would distinguish it from oak? Sorry for the questions but I am very interested in starting this hobby!,maplesyrup,dee8llh,1,t5_2tv11
