5377646,0,t1_cvyuslx,Great comment! Thanks for the feedback. Intro I want vocals a sample maybe some chords. As for the drums I dont know a lot of drum and bass so I wasnt really sure what to do. Second drop Ill definitely look into expanding that it was something I added last minute. Maybe ill make it the first drop and try and mix it up again for the second. Ive been producing on and off for  years now Ive always thought drum and bass was something that was out of my leagueish ,neuroproducers,cvz1zn6,1,t5_3a9ln

Kind of cool to see so many different takes on it.,neuroproducers,cxg1tey,1,t5_3a9ln
