3207374,0,t3_2wt6l4,From a biologic point of view I think that most people have abandoned the idea that homosexuality is a genetic trait.A number of studies have been done have not been able to link homosexuality to specific changes in the gene sequence.The current thinking now is that it is an issue with epigenetics  We know from the human genome studies that DNA homology is about . between all humans.If our DNA code is almost identical from person to person why are we so vastly different?  One of the big causes for why people vary from one another is due to differences in how when and to what extent their genes are expressed.  In reality the epigenome all the noncoding mechanisms by which our body regulates the expression of genes is also critically important in determining how we become who we are and we are only now just beginning to understand the mechanisms by which epigenetics works.Usually epigenetic markers are wiped clean from parental DNA when a new embryo is created.  There is some support that in homosexual persons some of the epigenetic controls failed to be wiped leading to their certain behavior.Im told that this model fits the biologic patterns much better than prior theories using traditional genetics but I think well have to wait several more years to see if this will be proven or disproven.Hope that helps!Edit typos,ChristianApologetics,coufyrh,3,t5_2t6hc
3568874,0,t1_cpz19zi,Im sorry but my morals are great. I work hard love my neighbors as myself do not lie cheat or steal.The fallacy that one must follow the teachings of savage ignorant goat herders in order to be moral is hilarious in its irrationality.People who loathe the poor prove that Christ is a lie. They do not have open hearts they do not love their neighbors as themselves and they do not champion the cause of the least of these.In real life it takes a male and female to create life. My belief is that the Abrahamic religions  created a male sky daddy and subjugated women to demean women due to male jealousy and misogyny.The bible says to be kind to the stranger in your midst to pay the worker what his labor is worth  DO NOT STEAL FROM WORKERS WAGES and to wipe out debts every  years.The bible says not to charge interest.The bible says a lot of things with which you disagree so I am amused at your professed adherence to it.It seems Christians pick and choose which verses they will follow rather than understanding their Lord and Saviors call to be compassionate nonjudgmental and kind.You prove to me that I made the right choice. Whoever your god is he has done a poor job of opening your heart and mind to the suffering around you.Thank you for validating my rejection of cruel meanspirited greedy Christians.I do hope that Christ was telling the truth when he told the tale of the rich man begging for water in death.You had your reward on earth. Now you will suffer the way you watched the poor suffer was the message to the rich man.Blessed are the poor for they can see through the evil schemes of the wealthy who use religion not to make life better on earth for all but to serve their own avarice and arrogance.If Christ is true and real I would be worried if I were youSheep and goats baby. Which one are you?,ChristianApologetics,cpz2ujw,1,t5_2t6hc
