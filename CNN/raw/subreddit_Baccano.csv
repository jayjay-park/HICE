7710448,0,t1_d3ijm4s,Ah I see.Well Baccano! spans a large chronological and geographical I suppose  New York Italy Illinois... timespan youve got the  novels the  novels the s novels... if any of the following interests you you might want to consider making Baccano! the priority Immortals | MafiaCamorra | Alchemy | Homunculi | AssassinsGunmen.  Characters youll come across A pair of idiot thieves | A solipsist | Moral and Immortal mafia gangsters | A gang of bootlegging misfit teenagers | Homunculi galore | A demon or two | Information brokers | A dual katanawielding Mexican assassin I recommend reading Baccano! in publication order i.e. the way it was intended to be read rather than chronological order. On the other hand Durarara!! takes place in one location  the Ikebukuro district in Tokyo starting in  and proceeding from there. Like with Baccano! Durarara!! has a similar theme of connections and interweaving amongst large casts of people. Durarara!!s cast includes An Irish dullahan working as a courier | A sinisterly clever information broker | a violently strong exbartender | The Russian mafia masquerading as a sushi place | high school students who are more than they seem | an underground doctor. Drrr! focuses on the chaos that surrounds its rather dangerous cast of characters and their interconnectivity  between the dullahan the internetbased anonymous gang The Dollars other criminal gangs like the Yellow Scarves and the other singular individuals that I have and havent mentioned. Youre right to be wary with anime adaptations  Baccano!s anime adaptation completely butchered the  plotline and left out several important recurring characters who affect later events in the novels. I wont go into the other stuff it got wrong. Gah. I know I probably didnt explain things very well so if youd like to know more about either series please do continue to message me. No need to apologize! All questions are good ones. Oh and in case you didnt know  Narita has also written two other LN series in the same Naritaverse. Theres the completed series Etsusa Bridge which takes place on a fictional hub in the middle of an incomplete abandoned bridge stretching between the Sadogashima and Niigata islands. The hubisland city has become host to criminals and wanderers alike and then some a refuge for people of all sorts of backgrounds and motives. Set  years after Durarara!.The other series Vamp! is currently at five novels and is ongoing. It takes place on the fictional island Growerth off the coast of northern Germany and as you might have guessed from the title is a vampireoriented series though other supernatural beings exist among the vampires like witches werewolves and Eldritch Abominations. On the island theres a mix of humans and vampires galore and its a pretty dandy little series if you ask me. Might want to give those a look as well although neither have been licensed so the only way youll get to them is through fan translations. Speaking of which if you ever need to get a hold of the Baccano! fantranslated LNs do PM me. Although I will of course encourage you to monetarily support the series!,Baccano,d3imk4e,2,t5_2t1pg

9432689,0,t3_59pnlj,Actually applying this song to Isaac and Miria is pretty clever. oh and let me just say in advance fuck yeah Cole PorterAnyway. No really though  its a song in which both singers put themselves down when in comparison to their loverpartner. And in the novels you get the sense that Isaac sincerely doesnt view himself as particularly special  especially when in comparison to Miria whom he thinks the world of. This is especially evident in his conversation with Sham in  Peter Pan in Chains. gt A fan...of me and Miria?gt Thats right. gt The mans words were suspicious at best but there was no doubt in Isaacs eyes as he stared at him eyes bright as those seeing a butterfly for the first time.gt I see now  well that explains everything! But wait one moment  being a fan of Miria I can understand shes as pretty as any gal on Broadway...but me? Now just what reason would you have to be a fan of me?A little later on gt Hold on now really? You were on that train too?! Wow  that trip really was something wasnt it? I tried to be brave so Miria wouldnt worry but in the end all of my efforts still did nothing!gt ...a coward wouldnt have been able to just wander around that train.gt Is that so? In that case Miria must have been very brave and I was just borrowing some of her strength! Although come to think of it Sham where were you during all of it? In the dining car?Meanwhile Miria is absolutely blown away by Isaac as a person. He was the one who made her smilelaugh and was there for her on whatever terrible thing happened on That Day.  He makes her smile hes probably the reason she enjoys life so much now. I wonder if the original creator of the video read the novels? Or is this just a happy coincidence....anyway its a very fitting song for them.,Baccano,d9bnpo9,2,t5_2t1pg
