3118534,0,t1_col7zte,Yeah Im in France thats why I checked it out. According to the info on the website theres  Uniqlo shops in France and  of those are in the Paris area none of the  shops are even remotely close to me so I was hoping I can at least order online.Edit I still appreciate you posting this. ,europeanmalefashion,col8hkd,4,t5_2v419
3474209,0,t3_3017e2,There arent many sales going on at the moment as theyre usually at the end of the season but I agree that it would be nice to have a more organised system.The main difference between this subreddit and rmalefashionadvice is shopping I guess. For style advice and waywts we can go to MFA but brands and retailers are more location specific. It would be cool to see more shopping related content here perhaps in a weekly thread like Shopping List in rmalefashion.Possible content could be sales as you said sample sales discount codes recent purchases cop or not good finds buyselltrade maybe,europeanmalefashion,cpoaa4o,10,t5_2v419

5710984,0,t3_3sms31,The usual recommendation is Lowa. Get the old models they are still made in Germany and substantially cheaper. Some of the current higher end models are also still made in Germany I think.I found the old models in discount sport stores across Germany.Unless you meant something more fashionable then I have no idea. And mind you these kind of shoes have mostly shifted their production to outside EU such as Slovakia.,europeanmalefashion,cx504l3,1,t5_2v419
