18597,0,t3_1uc2qj,I keep hearing the same argument over and over saying that basically any model of training teachers is more effective than universities teacher prep programs. From a research perspective what Im most curious about is Is there a noticeable difference in quality between traditional and alternate path teachers that is sustained beyond the first few years in the classroom? Does one kind start better and then plateau does the other improve more quickly and keep getting better?  Can some of the differences between results from the two paths be attributed to the different types of personalities upbringings or ideologies of people that enter each kind of program?,education,cegjtqg,13,t5_2qhlm

I dont recall as a teacher being asked how to best integrate these standards with my existing lessons. I admire your optimism but I am not confident that if things dont work right that teachers and students will suddenly have agency to make adjustmentsIf there was any other option we could weigh the two proposals against each other and see the merits of each possibly even implementing different versions depending on the needs of individual students.

197490,0,t1_cf0k11m,I actually think trying to establish one level of success for all students is the opposite of following the philosophy that every child can learn.  It means that a students who are struggling are sometimes given impossible goals which hurts them when they fail and b students who are above the curve arent expected to learn much at all.  The students who have realistic goals and are encouraged to reach those goals are actually a very narrow band.Again as others have mentioned this isnt about the existence of the common core state standards.  Its about the way they are used.  I like the existence of the standards though I agree with others that it would be nice if there were an easier process for getting their shortcomings fixed.

314083,0,t1_cfd77ae,I agree with you it is odd from my perspective as well. Here in the Netherlands all secondary school children bring their own food. Most larger schools do have a cafeterialike corner to buy school sanctioned snacks milk and hot drinks and fruit. As most younger students often arent allowed to leave the school during school hours they either bring their food or go hungry.In primary school it isnt uncommon for children to bikewalk back home during lunch eat at home and come back again. For those children that live too far or dont have any parents at home they can eat at school. Still most often they eat their own food. There are some schools that have started offering lunches and offering parents to have their children kept at school from start till late afternoon starting with school followed by day care but then for older children.I think lunches are reasonable okayish although some children dont eat their food from home going instead for unhealthy shit they got elsewhere. More problematic seems to be breakfast as there are concerns that some children dont get any. As these children often have also other negative factors like low social class bad neighborhood parents giving bad example etc some propose to start schools with breakfast.I dont know how I feel about that.

Take your concerns to your local Texas school board theyll be more capable of achieving what you ask.The position of the Secretary of Education is simply to represent and advocate for the Presidents federal education initiatives. He cannot control any state or school district and force them to act in a certain way. Remember that education is still predominantly a local domain where states and counties write the rules. The federal governments role is to provide funds to programs and schools to improve student performance particularly for poor students.Sec. Duncans function is to provide guidance and support highlighting the best educational initiatives under the assumption that others will follow suit. His office also handles the implementation of No Child Left Behind Race to the Top and other federal education laws and programs. Whether or not he has been successful in his role is up to your interpretation.If you advocate for maternal leave for teachers in general that may be something that can be enacted through Congress.

611881,0,t3_215jxk,What an interesting question! Having taught books like MAUS and Night to multiple English classes I can offer my perspective.gtIt had a profound but negative impact on me because I learned about this at the age of  and  and I was traumatized by the hate I learned the world has.Me too. I learned about the holocaust at synagogue Saturday School. We all took the course in th grade which is also when most of us were going through the process of bar and bat mitzvah. Unlike the times I learned about it in my secular public high school this course was no holds barred meaning that we saw graphic pictures and films read graphic accounts learned horrifying facts and spoke with many survivors. I had many bad dreams. As a Jew even in America knowing about the holocaust has made me live with a degree of fear that this could happen again not just to Jews but to any marginalized people. It contributed in a huge way to my urges towards social justice and a sensitivity to the suffering of others both in history and today whether they be in Rwanda or Syria. It taught me that part of becoming an adult is understanding that humanity has a deep evil. It also taught me about the efforts of many brave and heroic people however like those in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and the Defiant story of the Bielski brothers and many nonJews like those in Denmark Sweden and England.So to answer your questiongtIs this really the time to learn about all the violence and atrocities and give so much focus on that particular subject?Yes this is the time. And as uitsacalamity pointed out your comparisons to Mother Theresa and Gandhi are not appropriate. Mainly the story of the holocaust is the story of Europe in the th century not just one or a few individuals. The holocaust happened not just because of Hitler and the Nazis but because a socalled advanced civilization allowed it to happen and continues to either perpetrate or stand by similar horrors. And by all means study these people! Yes you should definitely study Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X and Nelson Mandela and Eleanor Roosevelt and Jane Addams and so on but also the traditions that informed them like Christian charity Ubuntu and American pragmatism. gtThe adolescent age is a time where we are our most vulnerable emotionally and we are still trying to form our identities.Hopefully learning about the suffering of others and the perpetrators of evil will form a part of your identity that will not see yourself as exempt from suffering and will prompt you to take part in the diminishing of the suffering of others as an antidote. ,education,cg9tmxv,8,t5_2qhlm

In fact most of them dont even have APIB programs or if they do they have them on a very limited scale and mostly encourage students to self study for those sorts of things.The educational environment at those sorts of schools is incredible. Those kids come to school happy and enthusiastic every single day. They love learning they push themselves to excel and they accomplish things in high school that most college students couldnt shake a stick at  Im talking publishing in professional research journals etc. Those schools arent even concerned with the idea that  of their graduating class gets into college because its already expected that anyone who wants to go to college WILL get in. Theyre concerned with their IvyPeer rating and many of those push  at the best places. If you want to see what education today needs take a look at Exeter Andover Lawrenceville Trinity Dalton Brearley Groton St. Pauls Haverford Baldwin Agnes Irwin Germantown Friends etc. Its a whole different ball game. Hell even the average Friends Waldorf or Montessori school down the road does a much better job of meeting students educational needs than our public schools will under CCSS.

The amount we spend on education is cute but it is poorly spent and supremely inadequate.  The critical pedagogy folks would say that the role of educators is not to be fatalistic but rather to be active in using education as an agent to bring about that capitalist catastrophe from which the framework of a better society can be built.

1254281,0,t3_28f3zb,To improve our schools we need to make it more worthwhile to become a teacherRight now we treat teachers like crap.  Theyre told what to do and how to do it by people with absolutely no experience in a classroom.  The teaching standards and curricula and emphasis on standardized testing limit teachers ability to teach.  If we want to improve education there are  things we need to do give teachers and the profession more respect allow teachers to do their jobs without being required to follow formulaic methods give schools a budget that can cover the cost of school materials so teachers arent dipping into their own paychecks for classroom materials.In my mind  is the most important. If we compare US education to other nations that have betterperforming students the biggest apparent difference is that teachers and educators are respected in those societies far more than in the US.  It isnt just about pay  although having no raises for several years is bad for employee retention in any business  as much as it is about giving the profession the prestige it deserves.  Whenever anything goes poorly for a student most parents are quick to blame teachers and schools for not doing their jobs when in fact we as a society are telling students that education is unimportant.  Students miss classes to travel for sports they show up without doing the homework and dont have the same attitude toward education as is more prevalent in other cultures and is notable in much of the US immigrant population.  When teachers are considered secondrate professionals who couldnt do well in the private sector if you cant do teach how can we expect to attract talent to a profession?  If we paid doctors  of the median salary and treated them like shit and demeaned their profession many of the people who became doctors would likely have chosen another profession in spite of the pay.We tend to treat doctors with respect because our health and our lives are often in their hands.  Why dont we treat teachers with the same respect?  After all we are putting the entire future of our country in their hands.  An uneducated unprepared generation will spell disaster for a country just as surely as an untreated cancerous tumor will for a sick patient.,education,ciapzrc,14,t5_2qhlm

Proper online research that scales well. Data tracking of students clickersBut you cant simply just slap these things into your classroom!  You have to have a lot of work in designing the classroom or a unit or a quarter with it in mind as something integral.My school uses very little tech great books type school even in the sciences for better or for worse.  I teach science and I like the reasoning.  Your students rarely are going to have a deep enough understanding to really understand what a picketfence is doing to give you that data so the process of using a picketfence isnt very useful unless you have done the low tech version first and bridged from it.  But who has time to do  labs on the exact same subject especially when the low tech lab teaches the concepts and the data analysis better?

Sure. Or vice versa. There are many cases in which in the same environment the innercity kids outperformed the white middleclassers.gt SATs and other standardized tests reveal that difference.No they dont. I know what youre saying. Youre saying that tests are objective measures. But they dont measure ability. This is something studied and studied and studied again. If youre ignorant of this fact thats your problem. But a high test score does not necessarily correspond to high ability.Moreover nobody is saying we have to rely on individual schools. A portfoliobased system can still be graded on an objective rubric.Regardless though your entire premise that schoolbased measures are unreliable isnt entirely accurate either. Take the case of UC which attempted to institute Affirmative Action but had it struck down by the courts. They found a way around this by admitting anyone in the top four percent of their graduating class regardless of SAT scores. They found that Four Percenters tended to not only have higher grades in college than traditional admittees but performed better in nonacademic measures such as leadership and participation in student government.Standardized tests are demonstrably biased against the poor.

Scene  yo frat boy sees his friend Sheila across the quad. He jogs over and hugs her from behind and plants a quick peck on her head. Girl turns around and its not Sheila. Boy says oh my god! I thought you were someone else! Im so sorry. It wouldnt shouldnt have gone any farther than that. Because the boy has autism he was probably unable to fix the miscommunication leading to it becoming a bigger issue. One social story with a trained professional and after the fuss that was made he will probably not be touching anyone on campus again. The fact also remains that the University has a special needs program. If anyone is at fault its the university for not supplying adequate supervision of special needs students or making the student body aware that some of their fellow students may have social issues. This student is not your typical university kid. This is most likely not aspergerslevel ASD if hes in a special program. The students Ive worked with that go to these type of programs are the students who will most likely never live independently and during the interview his mom had to prompt him to respond verbally to the interviewer.

The conclusion is that if charters are meant to improve student achievement theyve demonstrably failed because they perform no better or worse than the traditional schools theyre helping close. The political motivator that keeps charter laws coming is that charters are founded without teacher unions. In the end charters are about union busting more than anything else.gtSome schools can pick their students but in most cities the lottery system is very well publicized. ...and after youve won the lottery sometimes you get evaluated and told youre not a good fit for the school.

The implicit issue is that the charter must accept students who live within its zone of operation and the lottery is for everyone else who is trying to transfer into the school. Those students can be excluded and you never quite get the real reason why. Bonus even if you live in the charters district you can get the soft sell to leave the school!gtSolving poverty would be better and have a better impact but improving our schools is actually possible.Or offer economic reform that helps parents get better paying jobs better benefits more family leave and continuing education for adults to wipe away the two leading indicators of student achievement income and education level of the parents.gtSolving poverty would be better and have a better impact but improving our schools is actually possible.Charters often have minimal support for students with learning disabilities.

I am sure my opinion is unpopular. I hope that everyone can see problems with this. An easy one that comes to mind would be the philosophy that college is meant to prepare you for the real world. Students need to learn how to check a freaking email account. I am shocked when I hear college students dont check their email regularly. By making Facebook the method of contact we are bending to what works for the students. Instead of investing in transferring life skills. I believe learning to write an email professionally is a huge asset in any career. However making a Facebook group for the classes can be effective.

There is a reason education is a mess.  Most wide scale changes get vilified standardsbased reform NCLB charter schools etc.  The central problem is that education is extremely sensitive and emotional for everyone involved. Very few people working in education approach decisions rationally emotions dominate everything.  Everyone wants every child to be above average.  Even if you try to be rational you have to take emotiondriven perceptions into account.  If you are someone with a rational engineeringscientific mindset who wants to just rush in with a brilliant redesign let me tell you right now it wont work.  Problem solving skills are only useful if you can convince irrational people to believe in your solutions so persuasion is key.  Change is also extremely slow so you need to have patience.

The white schools. Its not just funding either. Its about attracting talented teachers and decent class sizes good extra curricular activities strong curriculums and a good culture of education. Big trends in education are teaching to tests and focusing on behavior. We need to fix our public schools the problem before we fix the very minor issue of a few students not getting in because of merit. We have far larger issues in education than this and we always will because the media and the public will never face them.also If you look at the Fisher supreme court case race was barely a consideration for her rejection.

I can guarantee they wouldnt want their support aides cut because the Board determined that those students with an IEP gain any benefit at all from sitting in the classroom not paying attention or producing anything instead of the no progress they would see by sitting in a room in their house. Special ed has functioned under the goal of providing as much benefit as possible to each student who would otherwise be incapable of accessing the education that is provided to their typical peers.

For the kids left in the public system after their wealthier expeers are gone their schools are now even more impoverished than before by missing funding coming from the wealthier part of the tax base and the peer effects are even worse as well.  They will be much worse off.Vouchers are a contentious issue because they are designed on the one hand to encourage middle class families to stake out their place among more exclusive private schools at the expense of the lower class.  And in the process to be another way to give more of the upper class their taxes back by helping them pay for expensive private schools too.  But at the same time they give you the rhetoric to claim you are supporting equality instead so you dont have to feel guilty about advocating for a big transfer of spending from mostly lower income kids to more wealthy kids.,education,dctwuan,22,t5_2qhlm

Since this is TN we cant really bring union arguments into things because they dont have a seat at the bargaining table anymore. Kids who dont drive you crazy.  I have also seen public school systems that have outstanding Math and English programs compared with other schools.As being inside the school system I can go ahead and tell you that the biggest things that are needed for an old school system is money.  The argument that we use the most money per student isnt quite right in TN Last I checked we ranked rd overall in that department.  My school is a  year old building that needs a lot of updates a lot of technology to be bought and more teachers so we can have a lower class size.  A  student county that has  schools servicing all the students gives you an idea of what class size looks like.I think competition is a good thing but I would like the competition to be on a level playing field.  If you have a better set of teachers and a program that is showing success by all means you have my ear.  If you have a private and charter school that gets to choose the kids that go to that school that is not a sign of success.As far as schools go in the state pretty much every school system is at an average of being ok besides Memphis.  That city needs a lot of changes and that is what is going to be rough.I know I have trailed off on a lot of different points but at the end of the day the media reported that TN has  of its students not having the correct credits for graduation and this was not true.  People will remember that  didnt have the credits but they will not hear the part where the news story was false.,education,de50md0,2,t5_2qhlm
10930375,0,t1_de6ucby,I didnt say take away all free lunches.  I said take a look at those who are abusing the system yet still have more money in their pocket than I do.  I would rather spend that money on students who really need the help or on more resources for the school.Those kids can afford snacks because obviously they are buying them between every single class.  I would love the snack machines to be pulled out of the school but guess where than money goes?  Resources for the school.Ill take the down votes.  If you think school lunch is the most important thing throughout the day and you are going to supply it free to every single student you are saying we need less teachers assistants less teachers and less resources for the school.  This is going to cause a decrease in educational outcomes because you have  larger class sizes less tutoring opportunities and less supplies for educational opportunities.I said take a look at it not do away with it completely.,education,de7e3e6,3,t5_2qhlm

11055187,0,t1_dekxhja,There are lessons to be learned in socalled outdated literature. The Great Gatsby has themes about class and the American dream which are pretty relevant to today. Your classmates complaining about how the wealthier students learned stuff earlier? Class based struggle. Shakespeare  so many movies and theatre productions are based on Shakespeare. The stories are timeless. The Lion King is just an adaptation of Hamlet. Shakespeare wrote his own version of The War of the Roses much like GRRM and ASOIF. Poetry and Literature also capture history. I know very little about life in  rural Alabama but To Kill A Mockingbird is able to capture the general look and feel of the time. Not to mention the civil rights struggles that are still happening. These so called outdated novels are often able to teach both a bit of history and tie them to modern times. Thats why they are popular. Eventually you can pick classes right? I took a pop culture literature class that introduced us to different genres of popular culture  we read a romance a western a Stephen King some lyrics for current pop music and a mystery. It was an entertaining and relevant class  Id never read a romance novel before and we talked about the formula and how to get started writing them another student had never read a mystery. No one had read a western but they are still popular books. ,education,del34wu,3,t5_2qhlm

11569164,0,t3_654akm,From what I saw with friends who are professors if you are entering a field of study that you can get published in journals and acquire grants and funding for your research then academia isnt an issue. You will be an asset that the university is wanting to acquire. This somewhat boils down to Federal and State grants or large private and or corporate donors. If your dream is to focus on teaching and teacherstudent relationships they hire adjuncts or just import guest lectures. Im sure there are small private colleges still hiring for tenure track but they seem to be disappearing going out of business.Ive heard and its been my experience that Universities like to hire professors from other places so do your graduate work in a location renowned for that field of study. The school isnt interested in hiring you as much as they are interested in hiring the reputation and pedigree from where you did your degree. nd tier schools want to hire professors from st tier schools...again this isnt about you as a person they have to acquire assets and Professor Smith who studied at Columbia University is easier to sell to alumni parents who are spending major money to send their kid to college than Professor Smith from State University XYZ.Sauce Im a nontraditional student Ive been accepted into medical school. Ive dated several college professors...American higher education is a business and hopefully will implode soon its lost all moral compus and doesnt serve its primary mission. ,education,dg7dcat,3,t5_2qhlm
