9261534,0,t3_56qeis,In the season  contract the production company kept the blades as props. Its illegal and a felony in NYC where this is filmed to produce the weapons for the show unless they are props. Even if you wear a pocket knife on the show and use it for something you have to surrender it to the production company otherwise its a weapon. Ive never in my life heard anyone else on the show say you sign away the rights or likeness of the weapon. That is completely unenforceable. An inch longer shorter an  wider thinner another hole etc and they have no standing in court. Secondly I know of no professional that would want to make a reproduction of what they made on that show. Its just way to rough and ugly. You can not use the forged in fire logo or anything like that. Ill ask the guys if that was part of their contracts now. ,forgedinfireshow,d8pyslz,1,t5_3e7uw
