5773888,0,t1_cxcskfc, this is exactly the kind of behavior that has worn out your welcome. Not even a hint of apology or admitting wrong obviously at this point you just dont get it.Just do everyone concerned a favor cut your losses stay away from us and be quiet. Maybe in a few weeksmonths we will reconsider our position on you but for now the more raucous you cause will only make things worse for you.We dont have a desire to carry this any farther please dont add fuel to the fire. Just go and mind your own business for now and maybe it will blow over. ,CivAeon,cxcsyzg,3,t5_2zgpq
