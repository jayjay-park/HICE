5829046,0,t3_3u0a6y,I like the idea of the DEngine as mad science but I have to question how dangerous one actually is to work on.  There are billions of them in the Ctech universe after all and if they created horrible monsters on a regular basis no one would use them.  I  imagine that later developments eliminated this possibility though.,cthulhutech,cxjppdy,1,t5_2x2o9
