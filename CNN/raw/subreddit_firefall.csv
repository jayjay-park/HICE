64159,0,t3_1uucuw,Over the past few months Red  Studios has worked tirelessly to take Firefall to the next level. This includes bashing over  bugs improving the New User Experience adding campaign missions reimagining the crafting UI wandering encounters and many other improvements. We acknowledged the problems with our game and we have made it our prime goal to produce a better more entertaining Firefall. All of our efforts boil down to an upcoming patch at the end of January and we are beyond excited to give you a preview. To usher in the big January milestone weve kicked off the celebration with a Developer Round Table Live Stream on Thursday January th at  AM PST. Top Red  designers and developers including Scott Rudi John Deshazer Matthew Cucuzza James Macauley and host Frank Lettieri got together to discuss the changes and new features coming to Firefall. If you missed the stream live on Twitch you can watch the video here. Get an inside look at the future of Firefall and the thought process behind the games development in our recap below.StoryCampaignQ What can we expect from the new campaign missions and how will players access the story installments?gtA Players can expect a heightened emphasis on the backstory and lore of Firefall along with a deeper look at the reoccurring characters. We delve into the characters that you already know like Oilspill and Aero and also add some new ones to the mix. In terms of accessing the campaign missions players will not be required to start over with a new character in order to experience the campaign. Anyone can play and enjoy these missions. It is also our goal to make some of this content instanced so players can tackle them over and over again including leaderboard functionality at some point in the future.Q What is the mission ledger?gtA The mission ledger will act as a roadmap through the campaign. It is your quest log achievement tracker and instance launcher all rolled into one. In between story missions players will earn rank points by participating in world events and open world gameplay such as tornados and ARES missions in order to unlock the next mission. We want to encourage users to take their time instead of charging through the story and knocking it out in a matter of days.PerksQ Tell us a little bit about perks.gtA The perk system is a new mechanic in Firefall gameplay focusing on battleframe customization and variety. As you progress and unlock battleframe constraints such as Mass Power or CPU you will gain perk points which can be used to equip an assortment of perks. Many perks can only be unlocked by attaining a certain number of constraints with a particular battleframe but once unlocked they can be utilized by any battleframe. For a detailed look at perks check out Ktavs post on the Firefall forums.Q Perk points vs. perk pool.gtA Perk points are specific to each battleframe and can be thought of as a spending allowance for adding perks to a battleframe loadout. The perk pool represents all of the perks that have been unlocked and are available to equip to any class. Players will all start with a pool of common perks that can be used as soon as enough perk points are acquired on that frame. The starting perks are general purpose improvements that will make life easier while fragging around the world of Firefall. The types of perks vary greatly from adding entirely new functions like the melee ability to an array of both passive and active traits.Q Should we expect perks to include stat boosts?gtA There a few perks that increase stats such as increased health regeneration and movement speed but the vast majority of perks create more dynamic options and gameplay possibilities to suit varied play styles.Reparability Salvaging and PrestigeQ Can you explain tiered reparability?gtA You will now be able to increase an items lifespan by spending crystite on equipment repairs. For example if youre a stage  player who has worked very hard to build an awesome weapon you have the option to repair at five different repair levels. Each repair level has a different crystite cost and repair point value. At maximum repair level you are using only  of your repair pool to repair your equipment allowing it to last much longer and therefore have more time to earn prestige through use.Q How does salvaging and prestige work?gtA While in combat your items will natural degrade and the durability will decrease. Now these items will also gain prestige. The more prestige an item has the better rewards you will receive when salvaging it. These rewards range from research points crystite and even special legendary blueprints.Q How will the inventory cap factor into salvaging and prestige?gtA With salvaging players can now take their huge backlog of items and turn them into extra crystite and rewards. It will be very profitable and useful to salvage unneeded items and clear out your inventory.Research Professions and CraftingQ How many research professions can we expect?gtA We are launching with three professions one for weapons one for abilities and one for battleframe modules which includes plating passive abilities servos jump jets and HKM abilities. Although were starting with just these three we are planning to introduce new professions over time. We also want to encourage players who arent interested in crafting equipment to participate which is why we will be including noncrafting professions in the near future.Q Can you give us an example of a noncrafting profession?gtA We have a lot of ideas in the works such as a resource hunter who would be adept at locating very specific resource types. Another idea is a thumper specialist who would be able to use modified thumpers with turrets or other alterations.Q What will happen in the new system with recipes that have already been researched?gtA You wont lose recipes that youve already researched. Existing players will be grandfathered into the profession system and will have access to all professions as long as theyve already researched recipes within those professions. As we add new professions those players will have to choose whether they want to respect into the new profession or not. There is a cost for respecs. The more often you switch the more expensive itll be. If you do so infrequently the cost decreases over time. You do not lose the research you had when you respec but you do lose access to the recipes for any profession you are not specialized in.UI Q What changes have been made to the crafting user interface?gtA We simplified the interface broke it down to be cleaner and easier to navigate. The new UI utilizes more of a visual representation focusing on easy digestible steps. Another change players will be able to see the final stats of a component before actually crafting it allowing you to tweak what resources you use before building the final item to craft exactly what you want.Q What changes have been made to the HUD user interface?gtA The new HUD has had a visual change to give it more of a scifi feel but has also had some usability improvements. The best part is that it is customizable. With the new HUD you can drag and drop abilities calldowns and items wherever you want on a total of eight ability slots. Weve also improved the chat UI with a cleaner look and the ability to add customized channels for army or squad communication.edited for formatting,firefall,celqg0d,13,t5_2s629

185901,0,t1_cezhkmy,While I agree with the idea I hate that attitude. Many games are about having fun single player games shared sandboxes like minecraft or match based games like TF.MMOs are about persistence what you do has lasting consequences. Therefore players care about not making mistakes or miss opportunities. The whole progression system primes players for obsessive optimization.Its not ideal but its unavoidable unless the game wipes all progress every week or so.,firefall,cezm1s9,1,t5_2s629

300990,0,t1_cf59jgz,Had to come back to this with more hard info. Just broke my first set of gear over the tigerclaw weekend  stuff that was nonrepairable but gained prestige. With its very limited life most of it ended up in the  prestige range which is about double the ish average of the legacy gear Ive salvaged. It gave back a nice return for the time used and looking forward to gear that is actually repairable while gaining prestige... well to my eyes theres not going to be any issue getting rp. Its not going to be handed to you on a silver platter hoping they dont nerf it to that but Id bet somebody that plays pretty actively could get that much rp in a couple weeks. Ill bet each TRUE high prestige piece will give s of thousands of rp.Guess that puts to bed any claim of high prestige on premilestone items as well as the fantasy you might have that I live in the game.,firefall,cfbyp3w,1,t5_2s629

360857,0,t1_cfi5gil,It probably does for some but I suspect for most it doesnt. From what I can tell this is just a lazy persons way of dealing with the situation. In some games the reasoning is fair and used in a manner that helps stimulate growth economy or exploration pushing you to look for new things in new places. The problem here is there arent things to really trade or work for other than playermade stuff. Which is an interesting take but is rather bland.,firefall,cfi634g,3,t5_2s629

654363,0,t1_cgej62m,From the sounds of it PvP wont be back again for at least another year or so.  Which sucks... it was fun a few times despite having those many problems with matchmaker and balance and aimbots.. If anything PvP was a good way for people to blow off steam because at least it was a good form of competition and fun and not as predictable as the AI.  I think all they had to do was make it pull players from a global pool instead of zones only and youd get more people playing it.  Too many headaches made it not worth the wait for a game to start.  ,firefall,cgenfxc,1,t5_2s629

1010044,0,t1_chj1rpj,But is it a good idea to have a weak backside? Bandit leaders are already like that. This one seems to be all about timing your front attacks. Giving it a weak spot behinds sorts of spoils that mechanic.I guess it can work if it can rotate faster than the players can so that a single player cannot eliminate it without either help or correctly timing attacks at its head when the shield is open.,firefall,chj3lfu,2,t5_2s629

1172544,0,t1_ci17jem,Actually this makes sense Remember when people say that the game is a beta only in name and that it is pretty much released already?This is where they remind us the game is STILL A BETA. We were testers and those areas existed for the purpose of testing. Now that the game is launching for real they are going to be more reserved about incomplete content. The areas will be released expanded in a further content expansion. When they get reintroduced they want the whole area to feel new to players. So what they are really taking away is not so much the area but the art assets.This also means they are going to start advertising the game again. They are going to make a big fuss about the Official Launch and expect a lot of new people to join.This is the danger of being a beta tester toys given for testing will be taken away from you on release although Im sure that well get to keep the stuff we have already bought with money like glider pads and LGVs.Aaaaaand of course this means that a year from now one of these areas will get reintroduced and the bitter trolls will get another chance to complain about how nothing new ever gets into the game how the areas are the same as before ignoring the expansion and how they are totally not installing the game ever again again.The one thing I lament is that the whole Blackwater campaign is broken. To ne honest I dont think these areas should be expanded rather I think they should be reimagined as instanced areas for the BWA campaign.,firefall,ci1j57c,6,t5_2s629

1351867,0,t1_ciljufw,Well right off the bat Id say no at least not if they didnt bother applying to the Delta. While they could have done something like this keep in mind that its an extra step to go through and so theyll probably not bother if its not necessary.

1546888,0,t3_2bxlae,Agreed it could probably use another design pass. It just doesnt seem to fit compared to the others.  I actually dont think its a bad thing to have one frame thats obviously larger than the others or one thats smaller. Diversity is not bad. The Arsenals problem is not so much the midsection but rather that his shoulders are too small in comparison to the rest of him. Give him larger and wider shoulders and hed look much better.  Warcraft learned this long ago its all in the shoulders.,firefall,cja6cj0,2,t5_2s629

1570787,0,t3_2c8jif,Ill spare you the long rant about why Loot Drops in general are problematic for MMOs.But yeah if youve got to have them drops should be perplayer i.e. onedropperplayer perhaps with a kill or assist requirement rather than shared i.e. one drop for the entire group.Ammo and Health Pack drops are already much more of a source of friction between players than desirable in coop play.  And I sure hope youre cooperating rather than competing with the folks in your squad!   E.g. Player A at  Health snatching the dropped Health Pack while player B at  Health arrives an instant too late.  But that said I sure dont want to roll for each of these drops!Alas R seems committed to the shareddrop model.  Bleah.  Ive already accidentally been a greedy jerk far too often.  And have been burned by such jerks sometimes accidental sometimes not even more frequently.Anyway while I would like to see the system change Ive already suggested my preferred alternate solution.

1585517,0,t1_cjezsok,the reason it reads like troll bait is actually ironicly because you took the time to write it all since it means you either . Care about what you are writing about and want your opinion well represented or . you just want to bait ppl into an endless troll debate. why the nd option seems more resonable in your case is because you only spent  hours ingame anyone who has actually played the game will see that it isnt enough time to properly test all the new system and how they impact each other no matter how much played you had before . patch.and im not trying to invalidate your opinion by saying youll get used to it as i alredy wrote maby its so bad for you that you cant even stomach it. then thats it no need to play anymore. The mobility system wont change red has already said this several times its because of pvp the mobility was nerfed. if you remember the insane mobility in the open world was not possible in the arena style pvp they had before either. so your hope of them reading this subreddit wont change that system atleast.,firefall,cjf0ysi,-2,t5_2s629

1921429,0,t3_2gn8tm, Raptor. It has the best group buff in the game. It uses a sniper rifle. Theres a decoy ability that pops a clone of yourself that turns you invisible and explodes after a while. All of these yes. Yes. Highlights are a thing you can tag enemies to make them take more damage. Jobs arent well tailored for sniping since you need to get close to trigger them. Doesnt mean they are impossibly difficult to deal with just that they will put you at a disadvantage vs tougher frames. All other events are fine. Some will be best suited for sniping actually. Recon is the default generic class available from the start. Raptor and Nighthawk are the advanced classes that you will be able to unlock later on. Nighthawk has stealth Raptor has group buff and both of them can pick abilities from the base Recon so once you unlock one of the advanced there isnt any reason to keep playing the base one as the advanced give you the same  more. You get one main weapon. Advanced battleframes can pick the main weapon from the base accord frame or their own. Latest update brings more main weapons to some classes so we might see more variety in the future. Totally not PW. You can pay for cosmetics and convenience like immediate access to advanced battleframes or transportation. What is worth noting is that you can farm ingame resources and buy the realmoney currency from other players so nothing is gated behind a  gate. Check the wiki in the side bar. Passive bonuses are called perks. Active skills are abilities.Each frame has   for advanced skills to pick from to fill their  ability slots.Sounds like you will love the raptor.

My own preferred Rhino ability loadout is Heavy Armor Sundering Wave and Explosive Rounds.  Im not a fan of Charge or Gravity Field...as I feel theyre both a little too situational and hardtouse optimally compared to Heavy Armor.

3087579,0,t1_coh7qyl,Hey JBWill. Since you are here I thought I should give you a personal heads up about the reputation system bug.It seems that the conversion from vouchers to reputation only took into account the amount of vouchers present in our inventory at the time of the patch and did not include the total amount of vouchers earned with each faction.As a result we are neutral at almost zero rep with the factions we spent the most time grinding  for example the ones in DT that had nice blue gear reward that we farmed over and over again in different frames. Because of this bug the conversion to reputation effectively reversed our standing with many factions. Neutral with the ones we worked the most with higher level with the ones that we only did a few jobs. I assume that the official forums will be full of that too. Is there an ETA for the fix?,firefall,coi0xom,1,t5_2s629

4763799,0,t1_ctuy0vi,I fully agree with your sentiment here aside from the need for a full purge.  But I wont argue that point further since I think Ive already made my core case there and we just disagree.However I do have a further disagreement about polling the playerbase.  Because I think its precisely this designbycommittee that has destroyed Firefall.   The problem being that the playerbase is heavily splintered in what they want.   Divisions some of which are falseunnecessary but perceived to be real regardless include PvP vs PvE      Some folks want a pure PvE game with no PvP whatsoever.     Some folks want a pure Open World PvP with some DoTAstyle PVE elements.     Some folks want a twostate solution  PvEonly Open World Arena PvP in regulation gear.     And this is just the rough cut of large camps there are many other positions in this divide. Vertical vs Horizontal Progression     Some folks want an Endless Vertical Leveling RPG with a powercurve that never reaches a limit.     Some folks want a flat curve with no vertical progression and just an increasing set of Horizontal Build Options.     And again those are just the major camps without nuance. Drops vs Crafting the battle for marketshare GearasVerticalProgression so Epic! vs GearasHorizontalProgression so Customized! And again Im just sketching the BIG conflicts of interest here...and not even touching Reds FP monetization of these.  E.g. FP XPbooster sales strongly favor endless progression...which is a lot easier to expand vertically.  I.e. some decisions maybe cannot even be playerpreference based to allow Red to be a viable business and remain in operation.But the point is  THERE IS NO CONSENSUS.  Just endless circular infighting about what Firefall should be.Someone at Red needs to establish authority and commit to a singular vision and DELIVER THAT VISION rather than just dipping their toes in the miasmic groupthink that is the playerbase.Some folks will be pissed.  Not everyone will get their petfeature pony.  There will probably be some compromises that please no one.  But at least Firefalls future will have a shape a plan a goal.And then maybe it can actually be delivered as a product to succeed or fail on its actual merits as a game.Rather than an endless series of demos that you cant criticize today because everything is changing in the new forthcoming version! and a mistyeyed promise of a better future game which can please everyone because it doesnt actually you know exist except in hopeful imagination!.Abusing my metaphor still further  Firefall has always had a solid  foundation  its engine and artwork.   Red just keeps tearing down everything that they build on top of that because they internally amongst themselves or externally consulting players cant agree to stick with ONE floorplan and actually turn that into a habitable structure.Anyway yeah I clearly! share your frustrations here.  I just disagree about the best way to remedy them.  For me its not morepollingandexperimentation time its decisiontime.  Commit to a design deliver it and support it  fix bugs and tune mechanics rather than simply replacing them.And if Red cant do that and deliver a habitable home for players it really doesnt matter what happens with the furniture.,firefall,ctv0rxs,6,t5_2s629
5212165,0,t3_3mcv39,plenty of people made it to  myself included.some core missions are compeltely new some are reworked old instances all have new and steady storyline and multiple talking characters. were worknig with relatively important people not with some random second rate ARES team like we do on Live. we also work as an Accord unit not as a mostly independant mercenary. there are also some cutscenes that shows what important things are happening now bad thing is those breaks replays  story is not obscure and elusive anymore but maybe a bit... overheroises player character as some may say.looks like things will make much more sense because right now theres not much explanation to why Accord is doing what it is doing.,firefall,cve9bvy,2,t5_2s629

6092000,0,t1_cyi2shi,gt ....probably through the html hookins most likely but I could be wrong.Youre not me and my brother had some fun way back. Figured out how to capture the traffic for inventory data and then modify it among other things.,firefall,cyi3iie,1,t5_2s629
6109365,0,t1_cyk1jze,I think TF and Warframe are great examples because regardless of their ARPU theyre popular and clearly sustainable. Warframe in particular has been in active development with regular patches for almost as long as Firefall so they have to at least be making enough money to keep the lights on and get paid. I was point them out not as champions of the market but as popular FP games.The core loop of Firefall is already sustainable. Theres lots of stuff to do and the vast majority of it is fun. The quality level of the content is where it needs help most encounters have never been retuned against the new or adjusted Battleframe functionality so none of it really feels good. The changes on the PTS are a great example of values changing without adjusting things like spawn count or spawn rates to keep up with the values.With regards to lag and other serverside issues this is a technical problem with a technical solution. It might be as simple as downtuning the events and reducing the player count per shard. In the grand scheme of things spinning up another shard is a hardware problem to solve if the same number of players are connected to two shards theyre still using almost the same amount of bandwidth as all of them connected to one.We agree that monetization is terrible. I agree that they should either keep VIP and do away with boosts or vice versa. I think something like the recent system enacted for ESO might work where VIP players get a monthly stipend of Red Beans to spend on fun cosmetic stuff and boosts alike in addition to a flat XP increase. The marketplace is a giant clusterfuck and I would love to see them purge the whole thing and return everyones sell orders back into their inventories while they work out a solution to stack selling and so forth. Albion Online has a really sleek marketplace that solves singleunit sales rather well.I have played the PTS. I think theres still lots of love needed. Honestly I wish they would have just treated the live servers as the PTS and tested their changes against the community as a whole complete with surveys and such closed beta style. It would have generated more gameplay data and provided a large pool of players to poll on changes.Ugh the LGVs. There should be special stuff on the cash shop of any FP game and I agree that groupaffecting things are more attractive to purchase I do love my tiki torch but the store seems pretty devoid of anything like that. Theres also the laundry list of QoL features that would enhance the cosmetic system framespecific setups etc. Finding an execution that feels both rewarding for people who spend without making people who dont feel shitty is really hard and they have a long way to go to get there.,firefall,cyk2m4f,3,t5_2s629
6153276,0,t1_cyotv8b,Yeah thats what I meant by it being semantics. I think PS fits the description of MMOFPS better. And granted I do enjoy it more Firefall at this point too but thats not a very high bar to pass for a few reasons.And of course its hard to compete with Tribesspeed movement.

6226255,0,t1_cyx9hh5,I dont know anything except whats in the official guide.Though based on past experience it will be terrible.Inventory wont clog though...youll just be overburdened movement penalty and prevented from picking up anything new.  I suspect InventorytoInventory transactions i.e. Salvage will be fine...i.e. you wont be locked out of that.  The salvage operation will succeed even if it expands your overall burden...though I dont think youll get multiple items from salvage no mats should drop like you used to anyway.  So most salvage operations should complete with equal or lesser inventory slots consumed.But yeah well likely spend our first  minutes in the new game playing the SuperAwesome Inventory Manager minigame.  Weve lost our lease and everything must go!  Salvaging all of our salvageonly gear...and hoping that brings us below our inventory limit.If Red cares about Veteran players theyll flag crafting mats as weightless so were not screwed compared to new players.   And I feel comfortable saying screwed because many of us purchased inventory slots with Red Beans.   But that remains to be seen.,firefall,cyxcvp6,2,t5_2s629

Not sure if thats your problem but I just abandon them and start a new job. I wish they would tell you somewhere in the interface if they have an escort portion before you start one. Also some jobs that spawn enemies to collect their parts just stop spawning the enemies you need. So you have to abandon them.

7662826,0,t3_4k6q71,ltrantgtgt I wanted to move away from content being tied to physical places to events that could unfold anywhere with the AI adapting to whatever location it spawned into. This tech was deemed impossible at the time but eventually we did it. Our system let us set up encounters and the server AI could drop them anywhere on a map and dynamically find spawn points for everything and even change what enemies youd fight depending on where the encounter happened and who was fighting. ...gt Our entire technology of the engine was built to be able to do all this including dynamic pathing recalculation for when new buildings were put on the map  it worked!. ...gt The Chosen would be lead by a NPC General Graves who would actually have real AI on the servers that determined where the Chosen would attack based on what players were doing. It would find the weak spots and determine the most fun way for the players to attack them.From what I as a CS student with some jobinternship experience can tell this isnt nearly as much of a quantum leap as he makes it out to be. In fact all these problems can be solved with variations of the same algorithm good old A Of course its not as simple as copying the source code from rosettacode and changing a few variables here and there and Firefall may well be the first game to implement such systems but come on.Alsogt ... about the previous video game I worked on that I was not allowed to finish ...gt ... give me all the leeway I needed as a designer ...gt I came up with the idea for Crystite ... and also came up with thumping ...gt ... because I was building a wargame not an MMO ...gt ... I was working on an AI game director of my own design ...gt Of course what shipped with Firefall was a compete redo of my original game they spent six months undoing my game and implementing their own version prior to ship.gt Id still like to make this game one day.Im struggling to find words to describe how arrogant and disgraceful this way of talkingwriting is.
