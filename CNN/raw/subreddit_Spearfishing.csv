If they cant see your eyes it makes it difficult to tell if youre struggling whilst coming up from the deep.  This could save your life.

However it isnt uncommon for them to charge at you so its a good idea to have a kill spike on the end of your gun to keep them at bay and out of tail range.

2419734,0,t3_2n6h0p,Im in South Florida near Lauderdale. Here its an  month season from August  through March . Regs here are  per person per day except mini season the last consecutive Wednesday and Thursday in July which lets you get up to  per person per day for those two days....unless youre in Monroe County or Biscayne National Park and then its till  per person per day there too. The Current FWC Rules . Unless exempt a recreational saltwater fishing license and a lobster permit are required to harvest spiny lobster. Lobster must be landed in whole condition. Separating the tail from the body is prohibited in state waters.. The harvest or possession of eggbearing spiny lobster or any other eggbearing species of lobster belonging to the families Palinuridae spiny lobsters Scyllaridae slipper lobsters or Synaxidae furry lobsters is prohibited. No person shall harvest or attempt to harvest spiny lobster using any device which will or could puncture penetrate or crush the exoskeleton shell or the flesh of the lobsterRecreational trapping prohibited. Regardless of what species you are fishing for bag limits are only for properly licensed individuals and those people exempt from license requirements who are actively harvesting. People harvesting may not exceed their individual bag limit and take someone elses bag limit. That is people including children who are not actively harvesting or are not properly licensed if a license is required may NOT be counted for purposes of bag limits.As for catching them I generally use the green lobster snare better than anything Ive used before and it locks in place when you pull it tight so its easy to grab the lobster without having it escape. Cooking them....I like grilling them up the best the leftovers are amazing chopped up and used in pasta.,Spearfishing,cmasdq7,2,t5_2rd1d

I contacted Salvimar with pictures and purchase datelocation about possible solutions I didnt even mention wanting a replacement. They blew me off and I ended up having to reglue  of my wetsuit top.Shit happens and sometime a product is just a lemon but Im going to give my money to companies that stand behind their product or are at least willing to provide information about a solution.As far as watches go Oceanic has bought out Aeris which was their biggest competition for freedive watches.

6122175,0,t3_3zcbvq,Nice fish!Im not sure but it sounds like you have your snorkel in your mouth. If that bubbling sound is something else Im sorry but I will still say this because it could save someones life remove your snorkel from your mouth when diving! Here is what I found on Spearboardgt Try pulling a snorkel out of someones mouth who is seizing at  meters. Anyone who gives this issue even a little thought will come to the reasonable conclusion that you cant close and protect someones airway with a snorkel in their mouth. And if you dont protect their airway on ascent you are fing up. So just do us all a favor and spit your snorkel out before you make your drop....thank you.gtOK here are some more facts. The majority of drownings are preceded by laryngospasm. The duration of laryngospasm is completely unpredictable. So lets say for sake of argument that an inexperienced pair of divers are involved in a rescue...no airway protection and snorkel lodged in their purple lips. Even if their laryngospasm was present until their totally gased buddy struggles them to the surface their stomach is now full of seawater. Laryngospasm doesnt do shit to protect the esophagus. CPR is a bitch under the best of circumstances trust me. There is no competent argument for dropping with your snorkel in your mouth.,Spearfishing,cylj057,1,t5_2rd1d

10265616,0,t3_5mz80i,Ill start off by saying my divingsnorkelingspearfishing experience is limited to the US Cali Florida and Hawaii so we probably have had different experiences and perceptions. First off the shark. It is really unfortunate that the diver had to defend himself and kill the shark. All of the spearfishermen I know dont want to have to do that. We all love the ocean and are usually pretty concerned in protecting it. You asked why was heshe there. Its a fair point I guess but would you have asked that if it was just a snorkeler and the snorkeler had gotten bitteneaten? Moving on I cant really speak to the whole shooting one of the few fish sentiment because all the places I have gone it is more like there are  fish and I am trying to find one that I actually want to eat. If a reefarea really has little to no fish the ecosystem is probably already pretty much destroyed and a spearfisher taking that  fish probably doesnt make the difference. I know other have argued that spearfishing has such a small impact and I would just like to share that sentiment by saying I am much more concerned with overfishing and especially climate change. Going to see the Great Barrier Reef has always been a dream of mine and with these kinds of reports I am worried it will be too late. ,Spearfishing,dc7nwcn,3,t5_2rd1d
