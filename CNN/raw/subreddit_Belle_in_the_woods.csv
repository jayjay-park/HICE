Its a very liberating feeling to not have to wear a mask anymore in terms of shit boss of the year.Id have to agree that as long as you enjoy what you do the degree is just a bonus. Philosophy is something you can use regardless of occupation. Theres some pretty bizarre degrees out there that people spend thousands of dollars on only to find the payout will never get you out of the bill.Im sure you have what you need for yoga ltchucklesgt the meditation sounds pretty interesting though I dont know how I feel about my internal organs being vibrated On the bright side tomorrow is Friday so rest and relaxation are on the way. Get well soon Tap dancing!!!,Belle_in_the_woods,dcns2jx,2,t5_3fqk1
