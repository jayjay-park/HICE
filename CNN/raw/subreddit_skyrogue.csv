689976,0,t3_21yez2,If the concern is just the ability to find your way back to your carrier it might be enough to just make the carriers color skin extend to its bottom.  This would make it much easier to recognize at a distance.,skyrogue,cgipadn,1,t5_2zpn7
1255811,0,t3_28dcfc,Thanks for the feedback! If you equip two of the same weapon it will double the ammo in the first slot and remove it from the second slot so you dont need to switch weapons to use your second slots ammo. Im not sure what problem youre having with the AGM if you can lock onto a target it should work. The screen is supposed to shake but your aero is not actually supposed to move. Is it just the screenshake?You make great points about boring but optimal strategies being fairly easy to figure out. Ive had similar thoughts about adding more pressure I originally wanted the game to be super systematic and only launch enemies from bases you can blow up but I might need to change that. It might be the best bang for the buck if the enemy simply sent more and more reinforcements based on how many structures youve blown up that way theres some riskreward involved.,skyrogue,ciaw6py,3,t5_2zpn7

1925943,0,t1_ckl9emm,Im using a  controller it labels it as id  I think? Im not at my computer right now Ill be able to edit this better tonight when I get homeEdit Yeah it says Gamepad Xbox  Controller and Profile Xbox  Controller on Windows idIve messed about a bit in the controls.ini and I did at least make it so the key remapping at the launch screen recognizes the triggers as analogs but now they apparently adjust the camera rotation instead of throttle and select button still cant be assed to do anything.All this aside I absolutely adore the game and once I can get my controller working so I can play it properly I can already tell that Alpha  has a much more challenging and rewarding experience than  I cant wait to see what this game can be by the time its out of beta!,skyrogue,ckl9g92,1,t5_2zpn7

3645188,0,t3_3245pt,Try making sure none of the files or folders are set to readonly. The game tries to make a Save subdirectory in the skyrogue directory so that might cause a problem.,skyrogue,cq7s0xw,2,t5_2zpn7
