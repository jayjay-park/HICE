295573,0,t1_cfbe2dz,From the New Yorker article gt gt Fussy critiques of scientific experiments have become integral to what is known as the sound science campaign an effort by interest groups and industries to slow the pace of regulation. David Michaels the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health wrote in his book Doubt Is Their Product  that corporations have developed sophisticated strategies for manufacturing and magnifying uncertainty. In the eighties and nineties the tobacco industry fended off regulations by drawing attention to questions about the science of secondhand smoke. Many companies have adopted this tactic. Industry has learned that debating the science is much easier and more effective than debating the policy Michaels wrote. In field after field year after year conclusions that might support regulation are always disputed. Animal data are deemed not relevant human data not representative and exposure data not reliable.gt gt Again while I appreciate that being called a shill is distracting and often unwarranted this culture of distrust wasnt created by the community. You can come to Hailcorporate and try to argue with folks here all youd like but thats not actually going to reverse the trend of people doubting your allegiance to public interests. I completely agree with hysteria polluting discourse and I would say that at this point the bell has been rung no sense trying to unring it. People only started using the word shill because shills became a real and pervasive part of how we discuss science in this country. Companies who assumed they were too powerful to actually bear responsibility or blowback are currently witnessing the situation spinning out of their hands. Im not calling it enlightened Im not saying that it makes the conversation easier or in any structural way improves the quality of discourse. What Im saying is that this behavior was in response to stimuli and what youre doing here amounts to a form of victim blaming. Yes things are now insane but its because we couldnt have a civil conversation without certain large organizations trying to tilt the entire field in their favor and now the field is a quagmire. This is why we cant have nice things.,HailCorporate,cfbehg1,0,t5_2t1sc

Unfortunately for Texas they cant even do BBQ right. Pork is the best meat for BBQ and Texas is full of beef. Go figure theyre second best in BBQ. Arguably theyre not even nd when compared to other southern states. Stanford gt UT. of course everything in CA is both bigger and better than what Texas has even the football teams go figure UT is alright but there are much better schools on a national level. Austin is alright sort of like an oasis surrounded by shit. But the only reason Austin is alight is because its slightly less shitty than all its surroundings. Its still filled with rednecks. Its just dumbass rednecks  college kids. Id invite you to please come to Boston or NY and then tell me about how ahead of the bellcurve UT is... You barely felt the recession in  but the whole thing was a product of policy decision enacted by a president who called Texas home. Thats right George W. Bush isnt exactly something to be proud of that whole eight years of sending the country back to hell. The administration that brought us the Patriot Act an unjustified illegal oil war that took a positive national budget and turned it into a giant deficit that ignored the constitution and FISA. Yeah real American hero you guys produced there. Be sure to hold him up proud as one of the fine national contributions to come from Texas. The oil industry is one of the shittiest most corrupt and detrimental industries and lobbies in this country. You can thank the Oil Industry for the gulf oil spill. And for destroying the USs public transit systems in the early th c.  Houston A lot of dumb people  a strong intellectual society. Look at Seattle  of the population has at least a BA and its one of the most literate cities in the country. Seattles population isnt even a million and they are much much smarter than any city in Texas including Austin. Who cares that Houston has a big population. Great job you have a large city full of idiots. Pat yourself on the back for that one.So essentially your points are that Texas found some oil in the ground has a lot of cows and is close to the equator and that somehow makes it a cultural beacon and a source of national pride?

Plus the evidence being put forward that proves theyre secretly an American or a coke shill in this case is so marginal and the responses so confident that its proven confirmation OMG someone in America has that name! Case Closed!  that its just ludicrous.Some person posted about their spelling of the word behavior when correct Aussie spelling is behaviour.Virtually everyone in the world who owns an android or iphone that uses English their phone will autocorrect to American spellings even if you set your internal language to Australian or UK English. Much to my disgust because I have to correct the spelling on virtually every post I make using my phone. Yet to some people this spelling is clear proof that the person isnt who they say they are.

3298639,0,t1_cp493ck,Wow its obvious you are both very dedicated and have done extensive research on this thing. Id say the odds are about  on you being a shill or a troll especially as youre on this forum. You called me an irrational loon without explaining why in your first post. That is as clearcut an ad hominem as I have ever seen. Maybe it was the basis of your argument but it was a poor base as you didnt explain why I was an irrational loon in the first place.if you understood what trolls are you wouldnt think they have some sort of advertising based motive.I wasnt claiming they were trolls or not just trolls you idiot. I was explaining that they probably werent simply trolls but rather paid shills advertising for this website. fierce defense? Im calling you an uninformed fool  thats not fierce defense thats the reality I see.Thats an insult and also an ad hominem. Thats why I called it a fierce defense as youre obviously quite emotionally invested in this topic for some reason.I wish someone paid me to point out how dumb you sound but alas no nobody is paying me. Ill take some gold tho.Another ad hominem. Are you even trying to sound credible?If you werent a loon you would understand that its the popularity of the videos that brings out the trollsIm not sure why I would have to point this out to anyone who didnt have a triple digit IQ but why would paid shills bother with videos that dont have many views and why do the trolls only troll the videos with a lot of views instead of all of them as if they were just having fun?In fact I bet you are too ignorant to know that they all come from a specific subreddit  but having any sort of information seems like cryptonite to you. Why get informed when we can just make baseless and loony accusations worthy of tinfoil hats?My accusations arent baseless. Ive explained why I made them and I think theyre perfectly reasonable to someone who doesnt have an agenda such as yourself. Simply because you dont understand them does not make my accusations loony.

4721037,0,t1_ctooj2q,Thank you for the class but you failed to make much of a connection between the topic of this post  the image  and your general feelings on marketing and Apples specific goals for advertising its products especially with regard to the implication that this image is somehow insidious astroturfing. How does this image positively influence ones perception of Apple within any of the criteria you describe? It doesnt make me feel sexy. Theres no grandstanding involved. I suppose you could try to make a connection to feelings of individuality but I suspect that will be a real stretch.A few additional comments since you took the time...gt Advertisements never cite any sources for their claims of superiority. Never is too strong a word here and therefore this statement is false. You mention car ads which is strange since the automobile industry is one place where these claims are most frequently backed up with details. This car parks itself that car is made with a finer interior. This one has  unique safety features. This other car is German which over time has itself come to be a signifier of quality and superiority  and not just due to marketing.Back to Apple though. Why would the company which has poured incredible resources into RampD for many years choose to appeal to ones need to feel unique in their marketing? Probably because advertising based on the quality of the thermal engineering of the Mac Pro is a complete loser outside of something like a hobbyist or professional publication. Nobody cares. Or maybe its because computers are complex products more than just their hardware and speeds. And when Apple does choose to make claims on superiority they understand that they need to make those claims in areas people care about such as ease of use or quality of the camera and sometimes they couch them in the individualist story that has served them well for  years. No you cannot be very individual if you have the same thing everyone else has but I say sometimes in the sentence above because I would argue that freethinking individualism has not been the overwhelming centerpiece of Apples marketing for some time now  certainly not since Tim Cook took the helm. Take a look at the last couple of years worth of commercials. They are much more likely to appeal to ones need to feel connected to family to make a difference to contribute something worthwhile to ones circle of friends or humanity as a whole. With that in mind Apples marketing has actually been far more collectivist than individualist recently and actually shows an acute understanding of the fact that a market leader cant play the role of underdog forever. gt Apple itself has been incapable of any original ideas since Jobs died.The history of Apple products has been one of continual refinement to a few core ideas with occasional risky leaps into new territory. The small hops eventually lead to the big jumps. This might go on forever. It might not. Point is that the actual number of truly new and unique products coming out of Apple in the last  years is actually quite low. They are actually doing some really interesting things in the services space right now with programmers and with deployment and management but none of that stuff is really consumerlevel. Theyve certainly embraced the role of innovator and used it in their marketing to great advantage but so would any company who had the chance to do the same. What I find most interesting about your statement though is that it seems to suggest the degree to which even you have been influenced by the story of Apple as the relentless innovator. Now theres something. gt someone should use this as the photo for a meme.Back to the pic thankfully. Some college kid managed to make a post that got him a bunch of upvotes and a flash of Reddit notoriety and got all excited about the idea that his picture could be made into a meme. A cursory glance at his posting history shows that hes into photography as well  something hes obviously proud of. Why is that not used as a point in his favor similar to the way you tried to use mine against me? Probably because it doesnt fit in with this subs overlyspecific narrative and kneejerk tinfoilhattery. ,HailCorporate,ctpmjqq,1,t5_2t1sc

5308982,0,t1_cvq9o30,Do you mean this?gt Hi XC. Since this threads getting a fair amount of attention Id just like to take this opportunity to explain a few things around the situation from an admin perspective that I think its useful for people to keep in mind as this topic continues to come up.gt I mostly just want to urge people to not take everything at face value. There are a lot of people that seem quite invested in trying to get the mods to remove this subreddit from the defaults and unfortunately that means that theyre willing to try to cheat lie and do various other unsavory things to influence this decision.gtFor example the OP of this thread was using at least  alternate accounts to attempt to tilt things in here including upvoting their own submission and supportive comments and theyve now been banned from the site for that. Theres generally just a great deal of attempted manipulation going on around the topic of XC being a default between people attempting to manipulate votes using multiple accounts to post comments supportive of their side organized groups brigading relevant posts etc. Some people have even been performing whats often referred to as a false flag where even though theyre actually normally a contributing member of the subreddit theyve been creating alt accounts to make or upvote harassing commentsmessages in order to make that issue seem more prevalent than it actually is.gtAnd on the topic of harassing PMs one of the most frustrating aspects of the situation from our perspective is that theres been a significant amount of lying on this end. Weve received quite a few reports about users who have claimed to have received a large amount of harassment but when we investigate we find that theyve often never received any PMs at all or only one message when they claim to have received many. Some people have even gone so far as creating alts to PM themselves with so that they can take screenshots for proof.gtIm certainly not trying to say that there hasnt been any harassment because some definitely has actually occurred and please report it to us by sending a modmail to rreddit.com if it happens to you . But between the various outside groups trying quite hard to push XC out the false flags and the lying please take all claims about it with a large grain of salt.gtJust to be clear though well be perfectly happy with whatever decision the subreddit eventually makes about whether to remain a default or not. We definitely like having it as a default which is why we asked the mods if we could include it but if they decide theyve changed their mind thats great as well. Id just really like to see that the decision is made honestly instead of as a result of all the manipulation going on around it.,HailCorporate,cvqa8je,8,t5_2t1sc

He just takes the characters and puts it on a shirt without any commentary on the characters or even the Simpsons. The Simpsons have one of the largest licensing markets of just about any franchise and the use that hes engaging in Simpsonsthemed clothing simply supplants what is an extremely typical licensed use of a Simpsons character. Second it is clearly a commercial use. Hes seeking to sell a product using someone elses intellectual property without paying the customary price. Third with the exception of the front eyes covered by the masks he takes the entire characters and because he doesnt actually comment on or criticize the characters themselves but merely uses them to satirize politics there is no amount of taking thats necessary to the use. Lastly hes engaging in unlicensing merchandising. No court would allow something like this to go on because if anyone could just use the Simpsons for their own agenda without paying for licensing the licensing market for the Simpsons would be heavily prejudiced.,HailCorporate,d4c4acq,8,t5_2t1sc

It is a significant industry. You dont celebrate the team at Nissan responsible for the Leaf because they dont have the same profile.gt And youre standing here saying electric cars arent fascinating? Im sorry but that kind of makes you look like an idiot. The progress he has done for techonlogy is already invaluable let alone in the distant future.It is obvious we will run out of fossil fuels and it is obvious we need to to transition to a sustainable energy source for transport with electricity a good current choice for energy transmission. The obvious is not fascinating. The engineering is interesting but fascinating for me is the study of the universe on a quantum scale and its rather unintuitive behaviour. Or perhaps something like a machine that can read thoughts. It isnt obvious you can actually read thoughts with a machine. Maybe to an American this is amazing because you have had your lives dominated by the car and by oil interests.gt I just dont know what to say to this. Do you really not see the significance in having a rocket program? Obviously I do. I would love to see more money go into it. I find it very interesting but evolving rocket technology isnt the same as doing something completely new.gt Taking humanity out of earth? Planetary exploration?.... Should speak for itself as far as Im concerned.Sure that would be fascinating but Elon Musk isnt doing that. He is sending resupply cargo craft to the ISS. He is talking about space tourists. Actually living in space permanently is harder to do than you may realise. Planetary exploration is harder still. Elon is just another figure in the space industry. gt  Further understanding of the universe around us?Yes this is fascinating truly fascinating. It is also unrelated to Elon Musk unless he wants to start making particle colliders space probes space telescopes or whatever. Then I will find his work fascinating.

11528075,0,t3_64jdwv,is there a subreddit for videos that dont have rvideos rules? ie. allow politics assault andor police brutality?,HailCorporate,dg2pjiu,1,t5_2t1sc
11528711,0,t1_dg2rqte,I think they just dont want to mod the resulting shitstorm since somebody will inevitably dig up some personal info of a LEO and admins get pretty tough on that.,HailCorporate,dg2s50p,3,t5_2t1sc

11531296,0,t1_dg2v7qc,Im not saying they were just saying that I found them in Spocmos search. ,HailCorporate,dg32oz0,1,t5_2t1sc
11531404,0,t1_dg2vnnh,gtSeriously...go take a logic class and come back.LOL. Seriously? This is Reddit and common sense were talking about not an intro to philosophylogic paper.Soundness means that if the premises of an argument are true the argument holds true. If were talking about soundness both viewpointstheorieswhatever you want to call them are sound. One is much more believable though since there are less conditions for it to be right.The way you phrased it by telling me your logic isnt sound implies that you believe something else. Whether or not thats what you intended doesnt matter because implication has everything to do with the way its interpreted. Whats the point of saying it otherwise? Nobody can say for  certainty what happened except for the mods themselves so you could say your logic isnt sound to anybody making any point in this whole thread. If you werent trying to be contradictory then your comment was just pointless.,HailCorporate,dg334tz,1,t5_2t1sc

11648846,0,t1_dgfxagt,yeah I always wonder how that could be. Someone with a decent lab equipment could measure what there is in something down to the subatomic particles if needed. I guess the secret might lie in the method of HOW they make it not with what.,HailCorporate,dggesqo,1,t5_2t1sc

11670154,0,t3_66hgns,I still believe that rgaming is just too low a hanging fruit for this subreddit.rgaming rmovies rama etc links are not encouraged as we all know that it is filled with advert type posts in their own specific subject. However when a different topic comes up it may qualify. E.g. posts about a soda brand in a television subreddit,HailCorporate,dgitt4r,132,t5_2t1sc

11810178,0,t1_dgy847n,I did sub to there but then they banned me. Apparently they have some bullshit that scans your entire post history and automatically bans you if youve ever posted in certain subreddits that they find philosophically offensive. It also doesnt matter WHAT you post in those subreddits you get autobanned even for going there to argue.And people wonder why we on the Left get called regressive these days....,HailCorporate,dgyq3kp,3,t5_2t1sc
