I think the most important things are shadowingvolunteeringpractical experience letters of recommendation GPA and personal qualities. Try not to fret too much on which scores to send. Best of luck!,ClinicalGenetics,ckghei2,1,t5_2u75m

I also am finding that I really enjoy cancer genetics which is something I did not have a lot of experience with before I started my program. It is also an area that I think is easier to understand more in depth than some of the other specialties. The most challenging area for me would have to be metabolic disorders because I have trouble understanding metabolic pathways  My advice to you is to gain as much experience as possible while in college before you apply to graduate programs Shadow a GC or shadow many! volunteer in an advocacy center such as a battered womens shelter or suicide hotline work with people in customer service rolls do research in undergrad if you can it helps when you get to grad school with thesis projects. All of these will give you an idea of how you like the profession overall how you deal with people in stressful situations and how you work with people in general.Also for when you apply do not be discouraged if you do not get in the first time. Programs are very competitive and they cannot always take all the students that they would like. Applying again shows that you are committed to the profession. I love my work and I am always excited to hear about others who are interested in the profession. ,ClinicalGenetics,czxussn,1,t5_2u75m

11265038,0,t1_df8ufpp,Oh of course sorry about that. I think I will be focused on cases of lifehealth insurance especially when genetic testing is offered but may come with a warning about insurance problems. For example is cases like the BRCA where you inherited an increased risk rather than a definitive disease. Does that make sense? I would love to look at it in a general sense but this assignment does require a direct relation to genetic counselling. Hopefully thats helpful.,ClinicalGenetics,df8vjah,1,t5_2u75m
