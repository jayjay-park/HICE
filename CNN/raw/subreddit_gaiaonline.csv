4606037,0,t1_ctb62zq,gt may have given you chances to change your behavior through reminders and warnings in the pastExcept I wasnt given really any warnings. Yes I admit I made some empty useless posts. However with my original account I was given one warning and then a ban within a day. I always made sure to not harass anyone swear or go against the ToS after that first time but still I was banned for one reason or another.Ive never bothered to fill out tickets as to why after the first account. These bans happened so far after the creation of these accounts that I totally lost the email I made up for them.,gaiaonline,ctb6cki,1,t5_2rb4y

8704221,0,t3_4ys1ug,Some minor stuff here and there. Prepare for a bunch of Ids too.Id cap the gold amount back to a million. Everyones gold balances would be shrunk back to a million.Club Verge would be liquidated. Id borrow Linden Labs system of buying Lindens where you can input USD in exchange for x amount of GC with a bare minimum of  and up.Id hire credible programmers to do a complete rehaul of Gaias system so it is functioning properly in all parts of the site. Update graphicial interfaces and the sort.Id bring back zOMG! so the items can serve a purpose again and to quiet down the people who didnt get the memo  years ago. PId remove GC exchange from the MP.Open up an Artists Corner where you can exchange either GC or Gold for commissions.Merge Towns  and  by calling it Gaia City or something.Disbar Flynns influence by negating gold generating items entirely as well as make no plans for items promising excess amounts of GC.Get rid of Runway. Give CarsAquariumHomes all design updates and more features like the ability to eat the food you buy and interact with the items like TVs or so.Cut away all those stupid Free GC offers of hell that just want your personal information and the ability to harass you with spam.Assign neutral POV moderators to keep CB contained. Id be a little strict on how usernames are formed and what contents of subject are passing by.Bring back Gaia Movies by cutting deals with vendors and studios. As well as bring back anime shows looking to gain ground can be exclusive on Gaia.Thats about it so far.,gaiaonline,d6tntln,1,t5_2rb4y
