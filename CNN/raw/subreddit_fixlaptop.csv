8971953,0,t1_d7n9irv,I havent much experience with replacing the whole power port.. cause youd would have to find an exact model replacement.. you could try ebay for a replacementbut that seems quite the chore. Also its a challenge to get to the charging port exposed. If you have any old laptops that dont run any more that you could practice on just so you dont ruin your current laptop.,fixlaptop,d7qak8i,1,t5_3b9rf
