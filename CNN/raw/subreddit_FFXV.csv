Then while holding the shoulder button down you just get hit with the attack your character will do a block animation then hit the prompt at the bottom of the screen wait like a second or two until the second prompt comes up then hit that. Its all in extremely slow motion. I feel like youre not holding down the L button the whole time. Its the exact same thing you do to dodge attacks except sometimes it lets you have a chance to parry when the monster indicator shows up. Just keep that L held all day mate.,FFXV,cphv7mq,3,t5_2uk8i

In other words even if we were to go along with the notion that this was only for the deserving fans that bothered to stay up to watch the uncovered announcements which I dont agree with at all and were all set and ready to complete their purchase at the appointed time not even they could apparently be guaranteed a successful preorder. The powers that be in charge of this one did a horrendous jobplain and simple.The only right way to handle this one was to. Give at least a  hour notice. I honestly think a full week wouldve been more fair to get the word out and to catch the attention of people who have lives to plan ahead to make themselves available. Make the time preorders become officially available considerate to the various time zones. Limit consumers to either  or  max purchases per household.

I agree that its surely going to have some depth to it.I wasnt trying to suggest that skills are related to the killability of characters like I said to JoeKnowsZero above I assume that if the story needs say Ignis to die the mechanics obviously wont require his unique skills in order to progress once hes gone.  Sorry if I wasnt clearer about that.Tbh the main reason Im halfexpecting one of the chocobros to die is because weve been promised this dark and tragic and brutal tale and because theyve been pushing the whole brotherhood thing so hard especially poor Prompto.  Im sceptical about it the same way Im sceptical about the betrayal so many people are expecting except that the devs keep telling us they want us to hurt and they seem to be promoting Prompto in particular so much that it feels as though he has the Sword of Damocles hanging over him.  But I feel based on nothing! that theyll all survive to the final chapter as you said in a post below but then weve been told this is going to be a tragic painful story so... oh I dont have a clue tbh.

Same with Lightning she doesnt look like a soldier she looks like a model with an overdesigned dress.Simplicity is the soul of sophistication. This represents Luna and not Lightning.I think Luna looks perfect for her role. I dont really like her movie design that picture doesnt represent how she looks exactly in the movie its way cleaner and slightly closer to the game as much her face is not what Id expect of a  year old princess revered as a beauty she look  years older in the movie and with much more life on her shoulders. If she WAS  years olders Id like it more and think game Luna looks out of place.I adore movie Lunas side ponytail in that one image floating around though its the one thing Id rip straight into the game. Not that I dont like her current haircut.gtYuna had a very specific dress and style to her. She stood out. Luna doesnt.Yuna is wearing a kimono shes a miko she has a set up and it works even though its not original its good. Luna is clearly based on modern western every day upper class sensibilities. You wouldnt see pretty much any other FF character wearing what Luna does. Talking about the kingslaive pic in your edit it looks a lot less modern and everyday and more what you would expect someone in Game of Thrones to wear or what she might wear to her coronation day.,FFXV,d5jkm2e,2,t5_2uk8i

8601049,0,t3_4wvxmr,In terms of romantic subplots in FF games Ive always been more invested in romances that we can follow from the beginning and watch progress take FF as an example even though I hated the romance in that one. That being said the romance between Noctis and Luna doesnt seem interesting to me at all. I feel like we wont be seeing much development in their relationship only hints and restatements of where their relationship is  currently at which seems boring in the first place.Im also probably biased too because I had been super excited to learn more about Noctis and Stella.

8612079,1,t1_d6i2e2y,Yeah the thing is I am a huge FF fan. But Im NOT a fanboy. If I think something is up Im going to call them on it. Games with extended development cycle rarely fair well. Sometimes they do but Id say  of the time is a bust. Thing is that isnt even fully the developers fault. We the consumer over hype things to the point that NOTHING can meet of skewed expectations and companies bank on this and add fuel to the fire. Its a vicious cycle on both fronts. I know Ill probably get down voted to hell for saying those things but I stand by them. Do I think the game will be good maybe even great? Yes. Do I think itll be the second coming of JRPGs that so many fans not everyone thinks itll be. No. We as a video gamers need to temper our expectations and the industry needs to step back from the over hyping and under delivering of games. I think more transparency on their end would help in that respect. ,FFXV,d6i3um4,1,t5_2uk8i

8710396,0,t3_4zapzv,I have to agree with both ArkJumper and ADBarrera the combat was just a mess. An exciting mess but a mess nonetheless. Advent Children moved fast but still allowed you to enjoy the combat scenes its my mostwatched movie of all time and it never gets boring for me.Kingsglaive on the other hand is just hard to follow both in story and combat. A double sin as it were. Even worse was how they handled Ultros that scene was just too difficult to follow and didnt have a strong finish. In fact it didnt really feel like it finished at all. There was zero payoff at the end of that battle.This is the complete opposite of how they handled Bahamut in Advent Children nearly everything was easy to follow and it all let up to one big grand finale moment of Cloud landing the finishing blow. Amazing scene amazing music absolutely memorable. The Ultros battle had none of that.When it came to the final battle it had some cool ideas. Ruby Weapon vs one of the old gods ? come to life. Basically two giant creatures battling each other while two humans battle on them and around them. Two fights going on at the same time. Neat idea. But its sloppily executed too much dust and too many quick cuts hampered the enjoyment.Fast cuts and shaky cam are the horrible crutches used in live action movies by poor directors and actors. But when it comes to CGI movies NO EXCUSES. If SE made it this way because they thought it would appeal more to western audiences they were wrong.Overall I do want to watch the move again on Nov th with my Deluxe edition of the game but I know itll never come close to being as great as Advent Children. Too bad the potential for something great was really there.Also Not enough Crowe. Seriously should have let her live.,FFXV,d6ufoyu,2,t5_2uk8i

8802138,0,t1_d75vial,i cant say for sure but i imagine what hes getting at is the almost weirdly Americana setting for FFXV. gas stations arcade games a road trip vibenone of those things have been like this in FF history before and from what little weve seen of the game it is tonally very different from anything else in the series. not what anyone wouldve imagined when Versus was introduced which seemed aesthetically pretty similar to XIII. both stories can involve war and death but how were getting to them is very different. im sure the game will have all the dramatic hallmarks of the FF series but even compared to moments in other games that have a sort of lighthearted and adventures feel FF X some parts of FFIX the first half of FFX where its a stranger in a strange land style pilgrimage. i mean we only know a little bit about FFXV and even less about Versus so its impossible to say how dark the tone of either will be but Versus seemed to be set in more of an Insomnia style city location and primarily be about a war between countries while everything weve seen of FFXV so far has played up the idea of travel the very unique setting and a way of inhabiting and traveling the world that is pretty different from what weve usually seen. like the detail put into food plates. thats primarily fun its not supposed to accentuate the dark nature of the game through like realism or something. FF games are full of bright sides too so idk what youre talking about. Sure theyve always dealt with serious themes but every game post VI has had a healthy dose of humor and good times VII and VIII maybe the most of all which are the darkest and most realistic in the series. ,FFXV,d75wbbv,1,t5_2uk8i

8837125,0,t3_517qvo,I dont get this logic that consoles hold the game back from pc. The fact the developers have to optimise for one hardware configuration should mean less issues with performance as there are mich less variables that can cause issues. Plus high end PCs might be above and beyond what consoles can achieve but a good portion of the pc player base would be around or even below console specs and if they are to cater to these specs then they have to be able to tune the settings to suit. While also optimising the game for many different hardware configurations. Plus Tabbysan has said that if they were to make FFXV for pc they would remake the game from the ground up making it seem this version has no intention of being optimised for pcs and would only really be playable on dev kits so stating the game is built for higher end hardware is bs imo. Optimisation just comes in very late in development creation is generally done by pushing the boundaries to find the breaking point then raining it back in this means some issues do slip through the cracks but no risk no reward. ,FFXV,d7a3j2f,2,t5_2uk8i

8864098,0,t1_d7dbd8r,Exactly so dont shit on people who fund your hobby is what Im saying. Flip side of the coin is saying every game can also be played on PS is nonsense since when we all bought the PS we were told we were buying the next greatest thing obviously par for the course in capitalism but you have to remember it was also speculated that this was the last console generation that with a whopping GB of ram compared to .GB for the PS a GPU that equates to a  and provable diminishing returns on increased graphical fidelity the PS and Xbone wouldnt need a revision for quite some time. Everybody obviously knows that revisions and slimdowns are common but thing of it is both companies are coming out with revisions that are so enhanced from the previous version that they might as well be nextgen themselves. And youre right the th generation was indeed an exception but console generations had been getting longer anyway so with the  year length of the th gen it was thought that th gen would be at least  years. However with blunders like AC Unity and the like I think its fair to ascertain that Sony and Microsoft looked at their consoles looked at how ambitious game developers had become and realized that their initial boxes were underpowered hence the midgeneration upgrade. Its not an upgrade though its a doover. And if gamers want the experience they were promised the first time around they need to buy the console twice which is ridiculous.,FFXV,d7dc90s,2,t5_2uk8i

8884301,0,t1_d7frdwp,Are you not familiar with Carbuncle  ? Its a recurring summon creature throughout Final Fantasy first appearance in Final Fantasy V in . A Carbuncle is also a name for a red gemstone which all Carbuncle summons have on their forehead.gtgtA carbuncle krbkl is any red gemstone most often a red garnet. The word occurs in four places in many English translations of the Bible. The English translation is a rendering of the Vulgates Latin carbunculus a word used for a small coal or charcoal and also for any of a number of precious or semiprecious stones especially those of a red color. Jerome apparently chose the term because of its similarity in meaning to the Septuagints  anthrax meaning coal which was in turn used by the Greek to translate the Hebrew  nphek in two of its four occurrences in the Old Testament. The etymology of the Hebrew term is uncertain though KoehlerBaumgartner suggests a connection to  phook used in the Old Testament as a term for eye makup and probably implying a colored powder most likely made from a crushed mineral.

It could be anybody sure society his upbringing but I like to think Square can do a bit better writingwise with that.And your first line is exactly the point of confusion and why I said its a plot hole theres no way for Cid to know about an invasion that hadnt yet happened. But when thought about within the context of the invasion his line makes perfect sense and is quite poignant Niflheim ended the royal line of Lucis not even allowing Prince Noctis to claim the title of King.On the other hand what exactly does Cid know about Noctis? As the audience were only starting the game so as far as we know thats their first time actually meeting and Cids very first sentence to Noctis is the insult in which you describe? Thats just rude. If he thinks so lowly of Noctis why is he even having Cindy fix his car?Either way its bad writing is my point.

9031980,0,t1_d7x7pb4,It wouldnt have been releasing in a terrible state. It would have been released in the state it was at when shown at Gamescom. It however would have been patched the at the exact moment you put the disc in your console and it began the install process.  There was nothing visually wrong with it at the Gamescom event outside of lower quality Foliage amp AF. They mentioned the possibility of framerate issues later in the game which is to be expected with more crazy effects and lots of enemies on screen.   No Mans Sky was literally missing  of the content that was said to be in the games. It didnt even have move  of the features from the  gameplay trailers they were showing for years.   Based on what has been shown whatever they planned on patching in FFXV is literally already done. In the next month theyll be doing bug fixes and further optimizing that could have been done while we were already playing the game.

FFXIII was able to have such detailed character modelsenvironments because it was basically a bunch of small hallways that all connected to each other. FFXV doesnt have that luxury since it is open world and is far larger in basically every way scale wise. Doesnt help that the game has to be lowered visually to run properly on the consoles.Oncewhenif it comes out on PC itd be dumb not to and probably wont for a year if SE signed a exclusive contract with SonyMicrosoft to help with console sales I bet it will easily look better thanon par with FFXIII especially if you got a beast of a machine and run it at K.,FFXV,d8zzw7f,1,t5_2uk8i

My guess is they are banking on people to have actually consumed the EU media to set this up. The anime is really more of the backstory of Noctis and crew. While Kingsglaive doesnt exactly tell you in bright neon letters where Noctis and everyone is it is stated at least once.

So Lunas letter was just the push he needed for himself.Personally I feel like they could have been friends sooner if their personalities at the time hadnt gotten in the way.

9521802,0,t3_5b7ber,My thing with  fps is... yeah its nice. But its not essential for a single player experience. This engine really shines when it comes to lighting shadows textures and animations. Since this is the first game to utilize Luminous the way it does XIV uses a lighter version of the luminous engine but doesnt utilize it the same way it would be in SEs best interest to not sacrifice graphical fidelity in exchange for higher framerates especially considering the hardware limitations. To nail this down further this isnt a competitive multiplayer experience where a missed frame can affect the outcome. So  fps is a bottom of the list achievement considering the circumstances. This is coming from a guy who plays on PC with a GTX  FTW. I love me some  fps but unless its a competitive multiplayer game its really just a subjective QoL experience. Not essential to enjoy a good single player game.,FFXV,d9mrio9,1,t5_2uk8i

9559999,0,t1_d9r7d9m,Not necessarily the full Pro patch as you put it. Yes the game will have some form of PS Pro optimization by the end of the year but that could just consist of HDR support and some form of upscaling for k TVs and I wouldnt be at all surprised if thats all we get for now... Im crossing my fingers for maybe a p pro mode with improved antialiasing and a more stable framerate as well but thats by no means guaranteed.I cant be bothered to dig up the quote but Im sure at one point Tabata said optimizing the game to take full advantage of Pro could take months and it was also said not too long ago that the dev team was just focusing on improvements to the camera up until launch so honestly Id expect pretty rudimentary Pro support at launch just to tick the boxes with a patch that offers more in depth optimizations and improvements coming some time in early .,FFXV,d9rgsjt,1,t5_2uk8i

Click on Share which appears below the Youtube Clip. You will then see the an option Embed click on it. Uncheck the option Show suggested videos when the video finishes.  You can also do this from any video just expand the advanced section.Secondly in chrome get ublock origin.

No word on doing just main quest after main quest without side content.Just  hours for the average player with the average playstyle to see the ending title. And really now every developer does that. CDPR were the only ones I could think of that also said that you could beat Witcher  in  hours by skipping all cutscenes and doing only the main quests and do some sort of glitching.But the overall playtime for the story was still said to be about  hours and  hours for completionists.

Itd be a bit ridiculous if that was the case and if it is my only guess for it would be to ensure no early releases.

Stand by Me has over  recorded versions and it was played to death over the decades. Somnus is a wonderful original piece of music written specifically with the character of Noctis in mind.

9776023,0,t1_dai3bb4,Theyre already doing that. No idea about other countries but in Germany not exactly a thirdworld or lawless country by any means broken street dates do get rewarded. Whenever a store breaks the street date other stores in the same area are contractually allowed to break it too. I dont know if thats a publisher distributor or legal issue but my GameStop branch frequently dishes out games the day before the release only one day in most cases and when you ask them theyll tell you that another store broke the date and GameStop is now allowed to do it too.So basically there are only two parties getting punished the store who broke it first if they get punished havent witnessed that at all so far  and the customers who bought it digitally because Sony Microsoft and Steam usually dont break the date no matter what.,FFXV,dai3zxb,6,t5_2uk8i

If they survived somehow then why would they be there amongst all the other dead? I dont remember seeing anything at all that would allude to a possibility of there being representations in the ethereal realm. I would also argue that the battle in the flying fortress where you have to make the choice to leave your friends to die and go after the crystal was a foreshadowing and a test of Noctis kingly duty to let the past go and do whats right for the greater good even if it means people have to die in the process. This was also an idea that the team tried to get Noctis to understand and come to terms with after the fall of Lunafreya. They were all upset because they knew what had to happen and Noctis wasnt ready to come to terms with it. All of this could be just interpreted as them all being there for Noctis because they knew that he was going to be the only one to die but one thing still remains. The last words that he spoke to his brothers Walk tall was what his father said to him before he left Insomnia. He said this because he knew that he was sending him off to die and he wanted him to have the courage to see it through. He also knew the fate that was to become of him. Now after the  year coma Noctis understands this and thats why he repeated this line. He knew that he was about to die and his comrades were too. It was a facsimile and also an homage to his father.Thats my interpretation of it. Im not saying youre wrong but Id like to know your thoughts on it.,FFXV,daowncr,8,t5_2uk8i

9840287,0,t3_5g81nw,. People are debating this but considering Armiger is the Lucis Caelum bloodlines innate power Id say its likely. Going by what Bahamut said about Ardyn this was likely a lie. It seems as if Ardyn was once something like a sage king but became corrupted and the gods told him to fuck off passing the ring and crystal to another member of his family. Because Tabata hates happy endings. Nyx kill la killed him. This goes with point  some people suggest Noctiss line was the Izunia family but it might be something completely different because Ardyn doesnt expand on this. Noctis and Luna got to be together in the spirit world after Ardyn got banished to the Shadow Realm,FFXV,daq7nx0,2,t5_2uk8i

9841646,0,t3_5g88iq,I think you got part of it right. His friends arent dead that was Noctis making his peace after the fact him not having the ring on is the big indicator that this took place after the ring brokeNoctis is dead. He had to use the complete power of the ring and the kings to trap Ardyn inside of it and break it. Noctis is still dead tho it was part of the deal and just like Nyx there is no loophole. The Luna and Noctis moment was just the life they wanted to have only played out after death. The hole in the castle and the glowing petals most definitely give off a this isnt happening in the world of the living vibe I think.The ring breaking and Ardyn dying resets the world there is no more magic no more gods and no royal bloodlineI think it gives more power to the story Noctis dying.

I was WTFing quite a lot because of the completely different game style that it turned into which I didnt enjoy.

9872470,0,t3_5gmorm,Despite my problems with the games story I did think the ending was quite sad. Whats worse for me however if the thought of how much better it could have been with better storytelling. Something tells me a lot of story points and cutscenes were scrapped when the game transitioned from VsXIII to FF. Like seriously go look at the early trailers. Look at the  trailer. So much stuff is just straight up gone. Like Im getting serious mgs  Deja vu. Not to mention all the characters that are never given hardly any screen time like Lunas brother before getting some tragedy shoved in our faces. Another thing I was disappointed by was the lack of cutscenes especially in the first half. Like where the bloody hell are all my beautifully rendered cutscenes? I also feel as though the empire was horrible. Theyre supposed to be responsible for the fall of insomnia yet their presence throughout the game is nonexistent. Wheres the evil king from Kingsglaive? Wheres all the massive warships and armies supposedly hunting Noct down? It feels like the story was originally much different and probably focused mostly on the conflict between Lucis and the Empire and this whole Arydan is the bad guy thing was thrown in and rushed. I guess all the flaws only makes the fact that they managed to give a sad and emotional ending all the more impressive but its just so disappointing to think what could have been ,FFXV,dauemzy,1,t5_2uk8i

9882407,0,t1_davkkpu,Seems weird that the story hasnt shifted significantly from chapter  to  though. Maybe Im thinking about story progression wrong. The main story itself is relatively short. I just figured halfway through the game I would have a more clear idea of what the ultimate goal is. They referenced a few times in Kingsglaive that King Regis wasnt just saving this son. He was trying to save the world. Im about halfway through the main storyline and all I know is Noctis is trying to collect the Royal Arms but it doesnt even seem to be that heavily emphasized as his main goal. It feels like yeah you might as well do it since you have nothing else going on. Then at some point chapter  spoiler Noctis is forced to find the various summons which I guess Lunafreya set up for him. Theres like not a lot of explanation for them at all. Youd think there would be more build up to the fact that youre summoning giant elemental beings. Its not really well explained. Its super vague. Hell using the summons at all isnt really well explained. On my screen during the fortress siege to get the Regalia back it showed the Hold icon over the L button next to the word Summon which I did and it didnt do anything until I did it like  times. I couldnt figure out what I did wrong and what I did right to make it work.spoiler,FFXV,davp946,2,t5_2uk8i

9887655,0,t1_dawdf5o,That is exactly what they did.  The only difference is they caught it long before release.  This game was kept on life support while they tried to figure out what to do with it.  If this game was held to the same standards of other games it would not be getting the praise or scores other games do.  Everything this games does other games have done far better.

I didnt lose all  hours no but Im apparently going to have to replay the game some time in the near future to experience the story the way it was actually meant to be told. Thats nothing unforgivable by any means its simply an annoyance. I personally have no issue with replaying a game but many other people simply dont have much time for gaming. Its disrespectful of their customers times. And while you can just watch the cutscenes on YouTube is a valid argument I believe a lot of people would have preferred to experience it by playing it through themselves because thats how it should have been done.  gt What would you rather they have done? No game at all? Because thats what we GOT these last  years! You want more of that?  Uh yes. Wait a year to finish the game. The SE executive who decided they had to absolutely push the game out by this date basically condemned their own project to mediocrity by doing so.  gt everything else you said  Simply reread the post you replied to because I already said my piece on all of those points and you have done nothing to address what I said.  gt If yes then just keep up with the entitled attitude. Surest way to get what you want.  Entitled? Im sorry for wanting a decent experience with a game I paid  for and gave ish hours of my life to. Personally I dont actually feel like it was a waste of time at all and I did enjoy the game in its entirety I just found it very lacking in the story department which is arguably the most important aspect of a Final Fantasy game. I am glad the developers are doing their part to fix the mess that got released into the world but I am sad that it had to be done in this manner. Its a travesty. While in my mind it hardly mars FFs image at all as I am a devoted fan even still I am arguing for the sake of all those who arent nearly as devoted who might be new to the franchise who play FFXV in its current incarnation and go uhhh what the hell when they see that its incomplete.

9897538,0,t3_5h4y7h,Er one issue with multiple hunts is that the hunts spawn the enemies youre hunting and a lot of them happen in the same places as other hunts ESPECIALLY in Altissia. If you took every hunt in Altissia at once for instance youd be fighting a bunch of daemons in a cramped alleyway with no room to move and maybe not even enough room to fit all the enemies P Its inconvenient as heck yeah but oh well. The game has a tendency to ask you to just slow down and enjoy it and the hunts appear to be no different. Grab the Exploration perks and rack up some bonus AP while youre going between hunts it starts to add up and makes the travel time at least a little more productive ,FFXV,daxo890,6,t5_2uk8i

9906954,0,t1_dayv3dp,Angelus  has  damage reduction from all sources even though he is weak to machinery daggers still do more damage then the machinery would do because of the daggers attack speed vs all the machinery weapons. the level  mech cant be a example for any kind of min maxing because even with that ones damage reduction i have managed to hit  with dagger and balmund crits on him. Angelus is in his own trial and error section because of all the bonus effectaffixs he has. there is a new method i havent recorded but you can consistently kill him in  minutes with the new method.just for a example lets say the drillbreaker hits him for k because of the damage reduction im better off hitting him for  attacks of  from the daggers as its faster and will also charge armigar faster thus leading you to do even more damage. because of how daggers work even if something is weak to another weapon type  times out of  daggers will still end up netting you more overall dps. this rule is excluding limit break link strike.,FFXV,daywe5c,1,t5_2uk8i

The main story will take you through about  of the dungeons in the game leaving you with slightly under half the Royal Arms to find in the open world. As far as the levels required for optional dungeons this is what I remember Belouve Mines  Note the boss of this dungeon can be exploited for an easy kill at low levels Costlemark Tower  recommended Toughest one out of them all The Rock of Ravatogh  The Myrlwood  Crestholm Channels  Malmalam Thicket Disclaimer Those levels are off the top of my head and are personal recommendations.

9916034,0,t3_5hfyhp,I see what youre trying to say but... I dont entirely agree with your conclusion. You cant make an accurate comparison between movie and game narrative pacing... They are so different and the stories are told in completely different ways like how games are a highly interactive medium where you as much a part of the story as the protagonist as opposed to being an outsider looking in as you often are with a movie. Besides that its a lot easier to forgive a movie that is supposed to entertain you with a story for  hours as opposed to a game that often times have story content that can last up to  times that number. ,FFXV,db030h8,1,t5_2uk8i

Sometimes Prompto and Ignis would disappear mid fight as well and whenever they were gone I was unable to use either of their tech.Then during the block maze I somehow got out of bounds after doing a warp strike. I was able to walk around but I was out of the map and could see the area of the boss fight from the outside. I jumped down and the screen faded white and teleported me to the dungeon entrance. I went back to the block maze and during a fight  I activated a tech skill from Gladio but he somehow clipped out of bounds so when it gave me the prompt to follow up with the attack button I was out of bounds once again.,FFXV,db1r3fp,1,t5_2uk8i

It pushed Noctis forward revealed more about the Empire than any other chapter of the game and culminated in one of the best boss fights of the game. You could argue that theres meaningful metaphorical value to it as well. It may not be as much fun as other chapters but chapter  is a great chapter of a great game.

I also did not like the combat or linearity for crisis core.  The story was very good but the side quests were like the same  maps with enemies at the same location over and over.  And dont even get me started on the summons.  Nothing like playing a slot machine to summon.  The best ones for story and gameplay are IV VI VII and IX in my opinion.

The theme from Jaws and Back to the Future are also very very simple pieces but they will live forever. John Williams is an example of how music doesnt need to be difficult to play to be memorable. So you claiming that playing the trumpet makes you an authority on why music is good just makes you look like a huge fucking retard. Literally all  of the songs you mentioned are difficult to play on trumpet. Especially if you are playing from the original score not those watered down versions from Alfred music co That triple high C in the Back to the Future theme on the crescendo at the end of the piece is brutal on the chops and just thinking about it makes my lips hurt.,FFXV,db73km8,1,t5_2uk8i

9974846,0,t1_db5exqt,See making multiple parts of the game FFXV FFXV FFXV would be unwise. With a story linear game like FFXlll you can do that and its perfect once you beat the story theres nothing left and you get the sequel. With a vast open world non linear story like FFXV the world took a long time to make and theyd have to copy and paste into sequel as itd take too long to create another world thats the same size. Theyd have to give quests to the same old people not that many new character because theyd have to use the same location. A lot of the game is post game and that wouldnt be as good if it had a sequel. They couldve delayed the game  months to a year to make EVERYTHING perfect but would it be worth it? Debatable. I personally dont think so because the game is really good as it is and delaying it for another  months to another year is not needed. TLDR Its inefficient for FFXV to have multiple games in a series but it worked for FFXlll because the story was linear and the story for FFXV is not linear and it is open world.,FFXV,db7r032,1,t5_2uk8i

While that may appeal to others I dont know why they put their resources into something like that.This basically sums up my feelings about the entire dev process.Kingsglaive and Brotherhood Why the fuck did they waste resources not putting that in the game? Theres no way on hell it was easier for them to shit out a  minute CGI fuckfest of storyline and a  part Anime than it was for them to just shove that shit into some flashback sequences through the actual game. No way.Fat Prompto and CEO boss  I actually hope whoever came up with that is fired. Its so stupid.The realworld products... I mean I dont get it. That doesnt sell the realism to me. Maybe someone whos spent lots of time camping with Colemans equipment might feel like its realistic but it means literally nothing to me. How many people out there live that razors edge niche between constantly camping in the outdoors but also being inside and playing Final Fantasy games? Who the fuck did they target with that?It feels like there are glaring issues in this game that are so fucking obvious to anyone whos ever played it  even the little things like how some fucking trees look like you can run through them and you cant. Then because of the sporadic and occasionally retarded world design you have to run half a mile in the other direction to get around because some lazy designer was looking at a top down version of the map doing huge line streaks with the mouse painting trees in. This feeling permeates the in game world like a miasma. Shitty empty little outpost buildings look copy and pasted for no real reason either. You play as Noctis whos kingdom sprawls over  shacks.Just so much wtf? in this game and so much time and money has been thrown around already notfixing it that Im actually starting to rapidly lose faith in Square Enix.I dont think they are capable of management.They cant manage their projects shuffling resources and leaders around constantly.They cant manage their deadlines.They cant manage their engines.They cant manage their creatives look how fucking off the rails Toriyama went during XIIIs development. Bloody workers wanted to kill themselves because Toriyama was creepy as fuck and obsessing over created his perfect waifu in Lightning. How the fuck did that happen and go unchecked for three games!?

I also have no bloody idea how people applaud SE for the end game dungeons. They are friggin copy and pastes of each other with the same mobs repeated so many times depending on the dungeons level. On note of final bosses I found in the  dungeons I did that the boss is x easier than most of the mobs simply because you can keep track of whats going on without worrying about an enemy behind you doing one hit and throwing you in danger.I dont really want to do Adamantoise because the reward is soso and the fight doesnt have any danger it just takes time.

10007605,0,t1_dbc00js,Not sure. I feel like XV is actually one of the more straightforward stories in the franchise. One thing I really loved about it is they took the evergreen approach to the overlying story. By that I mean the classic FF games  lets say for the sake of this argument were so simple in terms of their story. Magic crystal holds the greatest power in the world. Everyone in the kingdom wants it. A group of heroes go on a quest to retrieve it. XV nods to those old games with a simple premise. A crystal holds the greatest power known to man. It falls into the hands of people who dont want to use it for good but because of a thirst for power and domination. A war between two kingdoms over this crystal wages for decades. But whats this? A chance for peace? Mary the prince and princess of the divided nations to bring peace to the world? Oops its a trap. Oops your dads dead and your princess is in danger. Go save her avenge your fathers death and bring peace to the world. Its so simple. But the depth of the story comes from character interactions and the hidden motives of an antagonist that you love to hate. I dont know. I think XV had a great story even with the flaws in its presentation leaving out the events in Brotherhood and Kingsglaive from the game itself was definitely a misstep. But I never found myself so lost to the point where I had to ask myself why my characters were going to a certain place or doing a certain thing like I was when I was playing XIII. Everything about that game felt so disjointed to me. Whereas XV is more reminiscent of FFX to me in terms of its storytelling and characters. And X is my favorite in the series so I dunno. Im rambling at this point. I love XV. ,FFXV,dbc0pln,1,t5_2uk8i

10035990,0,t3_5jfdeq,I can tell you that your MAX Angelus theory might be opposite because my first V drop was with the  drop chance food. I agree with your theory but I think the V item is rolled first if you dont get it then the V item is rolled.    I was only using the drop chance buff because he spawned while I had the food active normally I fight him with guaranteed crit food.     Past FFXV games had drop tables that were implemented in various ways with the similar method that you explained. If the first item roll did not drop the second item is then rolled for.    One variation of that has been when a rare item was not affected by increase drop chance items and were instead affected by increase rare item drop chance.    I believe FFXV follows a similar variation as the one I just described. My belief on this is because the DLC being released in a couple days is giving us an item that increases the rate at which fallen foes leave behind items of value where items of value are rare items. While our current buffs increase drop rate by  or  where drop rate could just mean the rate a monster can drop an item. With this theory that would mean our current food buffs do not affect MAX Angelus at all. Again this is all speculation so take my theory with a grain of salt.,FFXV,dbfpscs,2,t5_2uk8i

Like for instance who was Izunia? A brother a cousin? No relation? My personal guess is that he was Ardyns brother but thats just conjecture. Ardyn IS royalty though that much is clear and he WAS supposed to be the first King of Light. The characters state that much in game in the lobby before the throne room if you take the time to search the paintings.Honestly the guy needs an ingame flashback ala the Nibelheim incident in FFVII. Or better yet give the guy his own DLC episode. Im sure there is enough there to cover a few chapters and I would throw monies at the screen to see it.Ardyns story is essential to the WHY of this game.

10111625,0,t3_5knofs,My main gripe with the story is the lack of explanation and revelation of character motivations specifically those of Ravus and the emperor. Was Ravus a good guy the whole time who was worried for his sister? Did he support Noctis the whole time? Why did he put on the ring of the lucii? To gain power to fight the empire? Why did the emperor try to kill the astrals and plunge to world into darkness? Was it so that he could collect more daemons? Did the emperor want the starscourge to happen? Was the emperor just a stereotypical power hungry villain? Was it all just manipulation from Ardyn? Theres a bunch of questions remaining about the plot and characters that either are unanswered or are unclear from just playing the game. If anyone could answer these questions beyond just speculation that would be great as well.,FFXV,dbpjyyc,4,t5_2uk8i
10112511,0,t3_5knt6z,Noctis went after the Astrals because he needed their help to reclaim the crystal.Luna and the Astrals wanted Noctis to gain the favour of the Astrals as it was a necessary part of his path to reclaiming the crystal and using it so that he could eventually end the Starscourge.The empire wanted to destroy the physical manifestations of the Astrals so that they could prevent Noctis from gaining their power.Ravus is slightly harder to understand as the game does such a poor job of getting across what hes doing and why. Ultimately Luna is his main concern he wants to fight her fate as an oracle that will die for the chosen king. Its the empire that wants him to defeat Leviathan though when he doesnt they use that as an excuse to kill him.Ardyn helped Noctis gain the favour of the Astrals because he must have wanted to end his immortality and probably also wanted Ifrit to be killed. Hence him working his way into the empire giving them an army capable of taking the crystal and getting the crystal to Gralea which forces Noctis to need the favour of the Astrals and then allowing Noctis to actually use the crystal too. After using the crystal Noctis has to use the Astrals to defeat Ifrit which must have been a goal of Ardyns probably because Ifrit was his enemy back when the Starscourge first came because otherwise his summoning of Ifrit made no sense. Then of course Noctis has to die and command the kings of Lucis leading to the end of the royal bloodline and the ring containing the power of the crystal being destroyed Ardyns revenge on the Lucis Caelums destruction of the crystal and end of his immortality being fulfilled as well as the destruction of Ifrit who was in favour of the Starscourge and of the Starscourge itself which makes no sense to me as its like a physical disease thing that travelled on a meteor and even though Ardyn consumed it all two thousand years ago he clearly let it run wild for  years.... The Astrals were necessary to make Noctis strong enough to fulfill this all for Ardyn and they were needed to put Noctis on the path of ending the Starscourge which of course would require Noctis to die as Ardyn wanted.So the Astrals were made a necessary part of every factions story though it wasnt made immediately clear why with each of those factions.During those  years in the World of Ruin its not clear what they were doing but in the World of Ruin we also learn next to nothing about the state of any of the characters we care about and in the end we got absolutely no closure for any of those characters or indeed any single living character at all. In fact all we got were shots of fields and previously populated areas devoid of any wildlife or people. Everything after the time skip felt very rushed and what the Astrals were doing was probably not very high on the developers list of priorities.,FFXV,dbpo41i,1,t5_2uk8i

At first angelus was more daunting for me because I could hardly get any damage off on him even when targeting his weak spot and doing extended combos on him meant certain doom. Now after getting his moves down hes a lot easier to take down.

10169363,0,t1_dbwp6k6,I dont remember that line at all from the movie I do remember the empire forcing the marriage. But to be honest bad writing is bad writing. The game from the get go is alluding to Noctis loving Luna but when does he ever show love? When does he have a moment when he clearly loves her rather than his usual aloof answer of meh. We know he loves the chocobros  like brothers because the game makes it clear in the campfire scene. When does that happen for Noctis and Luna? When she dies? He could easily be grieving over her death because she was a childhood friend. Because nothing in the game shows love between them. Besides how is anyone going to sell a romance in a  hour story when these characters interact for about  minutes of it and thats being very generous its probably closer to  minutesThe games narrative tells us they love each other but both Lunas and Noctiss actions show friendship and loyalty. Not love. Thats why it comes across as a forced relationship.

10218440,0,t3_5mav1o,All  of the main characters are dead.  True the other  lived for  years in the Land of Ruin but they got to pick and choose their battles.  In the end they were at the heart of the darkness taking on the strongest daemons in an endless hoard.  This is shown when their spirits arrive in the realm of kings to help noctis cleanse ardyn.  All of the kings luna and all of the Gods are also dead.  They provided and sacrificed all of their power and energy to help cleanse ardyn.  There is no more realm of the kings or realm of the gods.  This is symbolized by the ring deteriorating away.  It is possible there is an afterlife where all the spirits go but its not the same realm as the kings or gods that we see several times in the movie and game.  I think its more akin to a true afterlife not a realm of a different dimension.  So in the end Ardyn won.  He ended both the Lucian and Fleuret bloodlines.  He also got all of the former kings as well as the gods to sacrifice themselves to purge him.  Ardyn was then able to rest in the afterlife.  In the end he achieved all of his goals where as Noctis His Friends The Empire The Kings and The Gods paid the price for the years Ardyn suffered.  One point a view is that they deserved it that they got what was coming to them even if they were not all directly responsible.  However despite all of them dying to let Arydn win.. they also won because they saved the rest of the world.  I believe the ending scene is one of two things.. its either them in the Afterlife  or its just a wishful dream that Noctis Dad had for him.  Even though he knew what was really going to happen to him... he still fantasized in his mind an alternate ending.  People claiming the rising sun at the campfire means it happened after is wrong.  The night when Noctis says you guys are the best took place prior to the final battle.. the second flash back showing the sun rising was to signify they succeeded at the cost of themselves.. The sun rises again.. just not for the heroes. ,FFXV,dc2bgb4,-1,t5_2uk8i

I even got lucky enough the first time to have  Angelus spawn one after the other except I wasnt strong enough to take on the other one right away and I didnt even know about the V version of magitek suits.Sometimes you may wanna do something else while you wait for an Angelus to come.

10256759,0,t3_5mudji,My predictions based on evidence ingame and intuition. Episode Gladio Clearly during the time he left the party. Instead I foresee it adding a few new dungeons maybe. Episode Ignis Set during the time period during which he loses his vision. They dont explicitly say this happens during Noctis fight with Leviathan and he was unconscious for a bit. I foresee it unlocking more areas in the city and MAYBE a little bit of the surrounding area...maybe. Episode Prompto Clearly set when he falls from the train. Since Prompto loves tech I foresee him getting some type of car and some of the Nif areas being opened up. His episode has the potential to be the second longest. Episode ComradesAdditional Party Members Its safe to say this takes place in the world of ruin like the OP suggests. To have a balanced CoOp you cannot have access to Noctis. Now to alleviate the issue with poor visibility in the darkness we dont know when total darkness occurred. If its set say  years in it gives time for Ignis to adapt to being blind and Iris to grow up and train with Cor. It also gives context to the  buds not really spending that much time together as we the players will be able to mix and match from at least  more additional characters. This update could very well also add new dungeons hunts and personal idea roaming bosses for given areas. I also think a safe bet would be it being gated behind a Chapter requirement unless you have a clear save. ,FFXV,dc6nrjb,6,t5_2uk8i

The cinematography just didnt work and I didnt know what was happening for most of the game. You start off with oh we need to get the past kings weapons and then stop because for some reason the astrals needed to be battled.

Granted the games tutorials dont do a great job of explaining the battle mechanics and lock on system but it works fine if you know what youre doing. Armiger locks off when triggered from what I can tell Hard lock works until knocked down and Soft lock targets enemy until released. Right analogue stick switches targets. Lock off is required to warp to a rest point or away from target.

10332344,0,t3_5nydkl,. In my opinion its a personal thing. Even though Noctis knows what he has to do a lot of things happened and not in great ways. The girl he lovedcrushed onheld important significance to him and had been chasing after just died his good friend went blind and now he has the ring his father once worewho died. There is a lot of weight and gravity behind it and Noctis is just not emotionally or mentally prepared for what it means to put it on. Because once he does it means he has to accept that everything had happened and that he is truly king. Its something weve seem him stumble with before like with Titan. He may also feel like he doesnt deserve to wear it because he himself isnt ready for it and there may also be guilt too. After all a lot of people died and suffered  for his sake. Its a lot to process.  . No real explanation but best theories I have are  through the  years of research they learned about the prophecy and thus learned where Noctis would show up it does have royal tomb structures on it  Gentiana Umbra or Ardyn told them. They had to learn somehow to give Umbra the note anyway. As for Talcott also no idea. Possible other roads are blockeddamaged or maybe he just takes that path in hopes of meeting Noctis since thats the closest pier.,FFXV,dcf88sl,3,t5_2uk8i

Ribbon makes you immune to coeurls instantdeath attacks.The only room thats troublesome is the one with  lvl iron giants. That fight can in some ways be a bit RNG since if multiple giants decide to use their vacuum vortex attack it can potentially instagib IgnisPromptoGladio leaving you to solo a bunch of enemies that dont stun easily and have some giant hitboxes to throw around.

10355384,0,t1_dce1gxt,Im glad Im not the only one with this take on Ardyn! I too interpreted Ardyn as being a good king who wanted to do the best for his people but instead ended up being rejected by the crystal despised by his people and cursed with immortality. I reckon if I had to wander the earth for  years with noone who could live long enough to share the time with me Id go a bit crazy too. So Noct gets chosen by the crystal and Ardyn knows this is going to be the prophecy of The King of Light defeating The King of Darkness so he sees an opportunity to orchestrate events leading Noct amp co through the game  letting Noct get angry letting him touch the crystal  to power up all so Noct can fulfil his destiny and kill Ardyn so Ardyn can finally be released from his immortality and curse.Admittedly we dont fully know if Ardyns account of events with Izunia is true or whether sour grapes for a couple of thousand years has twisted it just a teeny bit but I do like your theory on why he got chummy with the Empire  I hadnt thought about him trying to force The King of Light into existence!,FFXV,dchud2k,1,t5_2uk8i

But there are two reasons that I LOVE FFXV.  First reason is the villain.  He seems more human than a lot of  villains.  I could relate to why he was doing what he was.  It makes it even better that when you really think about it he achieved everything he set out to do. Ardyn plunged the world into darkness ended the line of kings and got  rid of his immortality!spoilerSecond reason is the four main characters.  Their relationship FELT real.  They felt like real people.  They bickered they joked they made small talk they commented on the environment around them they sat in silence.  I think this is the first game Ive ever played that felt like it had completely real characters in it.  I understood them and what they felt and how they acted.  I didnt cry at the last scene but I sat in amazement for a good  minutes and it made me reflect and come to a higher appreciation of my own friends.

10427910,0,t1_dcpz2fy,Not to try to be offensive but it sounds as your just not that good at the combat system yet or at least complaining that your not allowed to badlazy. Or dont have a good set up gear. I played the game at basically  level   did as much as possible at this lvl  and . And it night and day difference to me at each step. If your burning thought items its the games telling you probably doing something wrong but snice items are cheap and aboundent it doesnt really punish you for bad game play. But instead rewards for good play. how i think of it at least Theres alot of fine details to the game to allow you play though at any level and to make it harder or easier for yourself at any level.in theory you play the whole game without being hit and not use a single healing itme Levels alone dont really give you any real stat boost unless you get the right ascension grid. On the flip side you can by pass that with things like food bonus and better equipment. Then there also wep and element type weaknesses and resistances. So for me the satisfaction is in the combat system as a whole where leveling is just a single unimportant part tbh part of it. The ture leveling is in the knowledge gear and understanding of system like irl fantasy based on reality just cuz your older then someone doesnt mean you cant get beat by a kid or a grandmother that is better then you or that has put in more effort. ,FFXV,dcq2m2f,1,t5_2uk8i

You did it again in this comment. Im sick of hearing endless praise for a game that is so clearly a shell of its former self and was rushed out to meet an arbitrary deadline. Translation A bunch of people on the Internet like the game but I dont so Im mad that they dont agree with me since my opinion is fact And thats an untrue statement anyways.  of this sub is fine discussing things they think should be improved about the game. I think there should definitely be more story cut scenes more explorable areas in Niflheim and a better send off for Ledolas the sickest antagonist of Kingsglaive. However I think the Leviathan fight is pretty excellent and I would only want minor camera and control changes at the very most. Dont expect a ton of downvotes.

There are six cave types and  ruin typesThe cave types may take you a floor or two down befofe you teach the dead end but the bars will be open for you to go back out if you are going through a dead end path.The ruin types barely have any  way intersections but those intersections dont have enemy rooms in there and will literally lead to a small dead end with an item on the ground.You are making it more complicated than it is.

10563207,0,t3_5r672t,I like the game but I think its important to understand some of the flaws and how that might affect a persons overall reception of the game especially in lieu of the expectations inherit to a Final Fantasy title.So lets look at some of the cons The way the storyline unfolds doesnt really explain much.  Motivations arent necessarily clear and some plots seem to have never really been explored past their revelation. Gameplay is significantly shorter than most previous standalone Final Fantasy titles particularly if you prioritize the Story Quests over the multitude of Side Quests. Pacing particularly as it relates to the Story is a hot mess.  Your first few chapters are a nice slow burn and then once you hit Altissia everything starts rolling down hill.  The pacing gets exponentially worse the closer you get to the end.Note Apologies on being vague with some of these bullet points but I did not want to give away too much of the storyline for players who have not finished.And of course we also have to take into consideration the numerous bugs that players have encountered Cameras getting stuck potentially requiring restarting from a save point. Cid Upgrade woes sometimes requiring a simple nap other times necessitating completely restarting the game from Chapter . Bugs related to complex dungeons The Day One update that made prepurchases of Strategy Guides worthless.And finally... while DLC will continue to make improvements on this game there isnt really a clear path for how the STORYLINE can continue.  Rather it seems like any DLC will have to offer content that exists prior to the storyline completion. We see that in the announced sidestories for Gladio Ignis and Prompto.  But for some people that just isnt as enjoyable.  Its like watching a prequel... sure it fills in some gaps but at the end of the day you know what the finale is.,FFXV,dd5gj52,2,t5_2uk8i

The game simply let you choose your own difficulty level and play style.  FF series have never been in the dark soul torturesque type of genre.  They mightve made some enemies harder to make it overall not as big of a cakewalk but give the option of using pots for people who dont want to bother.Prob why there were so many lvl or no item challenge runs,FFXV,dd7n7im,2,t5_2uk8i

Throw on some extra exp food toss a full charge expericast a lv one each pull.Do it for a little bit rack up about mil exp go rest at the hotel in Altissa chances are you wont need to level much after that to hit  if you even need to.Im not sure though I was  by the time I was up against Leviathan...  when I fought Titan.

Going by the fextralife wiki it doesnt look like theres anything better in general? Balmung DPS drops dramatically with MP use. Shield of the Just has  Strength but it seems worth it in comparison to the  Vitality  HP healing and blocking. Bow of the Clever due to its interaction with Igniss Overwhelm. I really dont like relying on this so itd be nice if you knew a more ...elegant solution to large HP pools.  Does the Trident DPS come remotely close? How about Katana warpspam if I could handle the HP and MP issues? Sword of the Father. Just there for the Strength buff and anything that resists the Utlima Blade. Definitely looking to replace if theres a more helpful Royal Arm that Im overlooking. I switch out Ultima Blade for Spells in the rare event that I need Spells. ,FFXV,ddbeilx,1,t5_2uk8i

I was in love with the guys by the end and the picture scene hit me so damn hard...When the ending scenes came to an end I stood there and listened to the new startup theme for a good half an hour until I gave in and went to youtube to see it again... I watched like  times that night. I couldnt sleep I was feeling so devasted... For a week straight I would watch it at least  times a day and have Stand by me on repeat lol.

10702883,0,t3_5t2isb,I loved the first half of the game less so the second half. That being said it still held my attention through to the end which I just finished an hour ago. As Ive seen stated several times here I have to say that the characterisation was spot on I cant remember the last time a Final Fantasy game or any game for that matter did such a good job of establishing a group of comrades and friends and most importantly made me actually give a shit about them. I guess my main gripe is that it may lack the depth of some other games in the series for example I barely used magic as it just didnt feel right in this kind of combat though I concede there is probably a lot of depth when you get into the nitty gritty of crafting spells. The relative lack of weapons also seemed a bit disappointing though Im yet to tackle the post game content where I gather a lot of good loot is to be found. I didnt have my hopes set too high for this one anyway so I was pleasantly surprised and Ive enjoyed my journey through Eos greatly. Ive actually been far more excited about the release of The Zodiac Age as Im a huge FF fan unpopular sentiment alert! so roll on July! ,FFXV,ddjx8do,3,t5_2uk8i

10779594,0,t1_ddrqbcb,This game in particular does focus more on playability combat exploration and content diversification than history which is clunky and clearly rushed during the last bits obviously much stuff was cut it was probably going to have an awesome arc development and overall conclusion. That being said almost all the rest is downright awesome in ways that make the storytelling seem a tiny annoyance compared to all the rest. The friendship tale and the bros shenanigans are very good yes.

10818840,0,t3_5uk3ip,Opinion Edit  HUGE spoilers below. being demanded to cut late game content in order to fulfill deadline the amazing developers team in FFXV was pushed against a wall. So their solution was to still make a nice and heartfelt plot but much has to be guessed  la Dark Souls from late letters. Like you see Iedolas robes on a throne and youve already read that massive vanishings happened and youve seen lots of imperial employees attire all over the rooms in Chapter XIII. So you conclude he fell victim of Ardyns agenda becoming a Daemon himself. And many other info that would naturally take three or four hours of cutscenes and dialogue were cut like that. I understand its not what most playersfans wanted but given the circumstances it was deftly done. The history is still good and by the end of Chapter XIV I had already cried a few times... Those scenes were very good Luna being stabbed her farewell her other farewell when you make a covenant with the Glaciar ? Tenebrae clearly violently cut in the storyline still I got emotive when Noctis roams amidst the blue flower camp there forgot the flower name... The moody attitude and dialogue between the bros when they go for the Marlboro. Noctis serene and abandoned attitude like a calm despair knowing hes going to die...  This game is a  easily many times during bros gatherings  things left untold are still felt by the player. You can see in their faces their gestures.Much has to be guessed though. They didnt have time to make the plot acceptable for the mainstream thats for sure. So they decided to bet on the emotive instead of simplifying the story.One complain we see frequently  its valid I just dont see it this way  is about the Dogs time travel. See I know exactly what the devs were trying to do with that it came to me because I got some  hours before Chapter VIII  some guy on this reddit suggested enjoying the game as much as possible before Altissia  and then I thought lets get over with it if Im in for a bumpy ride XIII bad plot and all bad linearity disconnectedforsaken characters lets do it now. Then shit hit the fan people died got tortured lost vision my great great grandfather is rancorous to the core Ill have to die... As soon as Ive hit a dark Hammerhead lets do back to the sunny days! And man I had a heartache. All that sun that Chocobo tune those young happy people randoms in Altissia celebrating the Oracle the visit to her wedding dress. That is what the devs wanted but too loosely executed with the Dog time travel. They should probably have gone balls deep and locked it for after  years when Noctis wakes. Well totally fanboys opinion. Sorry for the grammar English is my third lingo. But keep in mind this is my first FF tho yo and cause a hell of an impression. ,FFXV,ddvvy0c,2,t5_2uk8i

At that point in the game my mom was fairly invested and as such I had her help me with the harder decisions. While she was reminiscent of the H of C she had some distinct differences  having a massive manor in the middle of a Venician city for one. That reminds me  while I cant seem to find it right now she gave me a card of such a scene A water city with gondolas going about on Valentines day.

Nice try trying to denounce my opinion tho. The story is crap the main questline is a failure. Point blank. The changes in the combat system I actually welcomed but theres no excuse for how clunky some of the controls are like when you are pressing x to pick something up or open a door it just ignores the command and makes your character jump.

11010391,0,t1_defyxx9,gt by channeling funds towards tech developers they are probably taking away funds from the rest of the team.its not that simple...and also that is not how it works in the industry. Much like Hollywood the larger sum of profit go into the shareholders pocket and so they get make the big decisions of cutting out content and putting in certain contentUnless this was a small indie studio. Story writing and character development isnt that costly or time consuming for game devs. Game development requires a long effort of technological research and development hardware rendering time testing....etc. So yeah its going to cost a lot more than story writing and character dev but that isnt the problem here. We know theres story in the game but it is clearly missing bits that would have created a better story. theres clear places where content was deliberately cut to save time eg tenebrae was almost non existant the linearity of the games end bit the disappointing end boss. Complaining about story after SE posted this is a waste of time.We already know that the team was pressured into releasing the game way too early before it was actually finished. they were only given  years to turn it into ffxv  the prior was nomuras totally different game with a different engine . On top of that paid DLC is a great way for SE to make back the money lost from development hell hence episode gladio and prompto. Check the history of the development for Zeldas BoTW for example it was delayed  years. Triple A games that are good often were given the time to perfect itself. amp its getting  ratings everywhere today.So no its not about how much money was put into channeling funds. It was time. This video isnt about story amp complaining about it in relation to this video isnt productive either.people should learn how to appreciate game devs a little more. These are hardworking passionate overworked people and yet we get people complaining about story. Cant we just focus on other greater things that not only benefit the game it benefits the entire industry? the knowledge gained from making this game would have certainly taught a lot more lessons for devs in the future to make even better games. But no a lot of people think it should be an opportunity to flaunt their complaints.... thats one thing i find that seriously disappointing about the FF fandom you can never please some people.,FFXV,defzwqq,3,t5_2uk8i

11034523,0,t3_5xjt9x,You can airstepairdance with ANY h swords and ANY lances polearms with the exception of the Royal swordspolearms. Check Youtube series for combos combo starters combo finishers etc. This guy is the real thing. Everything well explained. Check individual videos for Swords Greatswords Polearms Knives Shields Firearms and Machines. Edit learning Finesse is what makes the combat interesting in this game. Linking combos not getting interrupted getting parries... Switching weapons mid combo... All is awesome. Edit to easily start an air combo hold circle attack. Tilting the left analogic stick forwardsidewaysbackwards does different things mid combo just hold circle. Before finishing usually  hits into the combo pull backwards and backwards again. A trail of light is the hint that youre air stepping them continue holding circle while dancing around the enemy eventually pulling away from him to reset Air Step. You can use it to dodge strikes mid combo too. Remember h swords and polearms no Royal Arms. A silly example of Air Dancing not good skills tho,FFXV,deiql4z,1,t5_2uk8i

11040082,0,t1_dejcpy2,I wont try to argue for Kingdom Hearts being cleanly written or well structured but the games are considerably better than you might think.  They have a very dreamlike style where all kinds of disparate elements get jumbled together in a big beautiful mess from which emerges a kind of thematic nonliteral unity of symbolism.  Im probably edging dangerously close to hipster territory here but I think once you get what Nomura is actually trying to do with Kingdom Hearts youll enjoy it much more.  Theyre very unique creative games that arent really trying to not be a narrative mess.  They revel in being a narrative mess and turn it into a strength.  That said nothing Ive seen of Versus trailers has lead me to believe Square was taking the same approaching with that game and while FFXV is certainly different than Versus I havent seen anything in it to suggest this either.  Everything Ive seen has lead me to believe Versus was going for a classic FF style similar to something like FF.  ,FFXV,dejdgw4,4,t5_2uk8i

11331471,0,t3_5zzjex,So Ive been convinced. The bit about introducing Odin as being erased from the Hexatheon is what clicked for me. I think I can elaborate a bit on that. Its pretty much undeniable that Pryna didnt simply die of a broken heart. As a Messenger of Odin she was actually dispatched by Seifer who had been brought to the world of Eos by the Goddess of the Dawn aka Sorceress Ultimecia. This is where the song title Somnus Ultima comes into play. It details Seifers plan to dispatch Messengers one by one starting at the various diners found throughout the game when he defeats the Crows. After this he moved on to Pryna and swiftly put her down until he can finally meet face to face with Odin to slice him in twain only then will Greg be freed from his entanglement with the master of inquiry himself Ser Hildibrand. With the death of Odin Greg can freely slip his mortal form from the realm of Hydaelyn into Eos to defeat Cors the true villain of the Lucian royal line. With Cors out of the way ninja master Yuffie will be free to steal all of the materia from the royal vault and revive the one true Goddess and bring perpetually blighting light into the world. Once to world is filled with blinding white light the shadow of the Starscourge will be firmly erased from existence and Stella herself will find her place back into the world of Versus XIII where those SJW bastards cant stop her from getting beaten up like God intended. Now granted its a bit of a rough draft but I think it nicely puts a cover on the factual lore of Finer Frablasty VX agito.,FFXV,dfgeixn,1,t5_2uk8i

They obviously wanted to do the separated lovers who struggle towards fleeting moments of contact made all the more precious by how brief they are trope but the problem is none of these moments work. Maybe if the picture diary had been more involved they would have felt like they actually thought of themselves as a couple. There could have been more exchanges Noctis could have had a sidequest where he collected stickers to send to Luna it all could have felt a lot more meaningful.

11457411,1,t1_dfuo21r,gt Thats not locked content thats cut content.Now youre using semantics. The term cut applies to content that was planned but never designed never implemented or rendered in the actual game... only everything i just listed is actually rendered in the game. Its also explorable... using a glitch. Therefore since it physically exists and can be explored its not cut... since you want to be overtechnical.gt You were never supposed to access those areas since they were scrappedPure speculation at best. In fact we know the areas WERE supposed to be accessible BECAUSE of the glitches. Niflheim although lacking collision on a lot of its structures is actually rendered in the game. All of Altissia including the area where she gives her speech is ACTUAL RENDERED CONTENT its not hidden behind anything other than an invisible barrier. Thats one of the biggest complaints about Altissia. Its ALL there but just blocked by inconveniently placed boxes and invisible barriers. Everything outside of the Leviathan fight is actually there but its a ghost town with no NPCs or entities.gt On disk locked content is something like Noctis military boots and coatWell yes thats made pretty obvious by just about every industry standard for game design out there. Thats why we have data mining enthusiasts who often find hidden goodies but that doesnt mean that its locked. In fact its not that theyre locked at all sometimes but that only the games Luminous Engine can interpret the data properly. All that aside it sounds like youre veering totally off topic as something likegt Noctis Versus Coatwas never shown in any kind of media outside of a cinematic scene shown in the Omen Trailers. THAT would be something to consider scrapped as it likely never made it into the real game but could in the future. THAT is scrapped not an entire city that which has collision and an entire continent with roads and cars and some collision. Thats incomplete content which well likely have access to with the DLCs.,FFXV,dfuoty3,1,t5_2uk8i

11505194,0,t1_dfz9hg5,gt What about the games presentation contradicts my interpretation? The games ritual and mundane elements kind of pull against each other but that seems to be the point  theres something inherently confrontational about a situation in which a savior must be ritually sacrificed to undo a plague caused by a mutant strain of malaria.Im talking about the implied emotional context between the two characters. gt With regards to determinism I guess the thing is that the existence of a prophecy doesnt necessarily mean that choices made in the fulfillment of it cant be made freely. Noct chooses to be obedient but theres no reason to believe that he would have shattered the fabric of spacetime had he made a different choice. The alternate universe posed by the Omen trailer while unpleasant certainly doesnt imply that sort of consequence. And whether he could have chosen to defy his calling or not has little bearing on the worlds salvation as long as the blood price is paid.In any case your take on Donnie Darko seems even more traditional than the one that I ran into  if the core arc is about the protagonist first avoiding and then learning to accept responsibility and destiny then its really just a higherstakes coming of age arc. My argument is that while it shares common elements with such narratives thats not what FFXV is.For example one of FFXVs weirder choices is the choice to have Noct come to terms with the demands of his calling inside of the Crystal. We dont see the reason for his shift in attitude towards his responsibility he actually seems to have been imbued with the will to carry out his sacrifice at the same time as he was granted the necessary power. If responsibility and acceptance is the point that really doesnt make much sense  that decision point should be critical to the story. But its not. Its given almost no focus whatsoever.And thats one of the reasons why it just makes more sense for FFXVs interest to be in the ritual itself. Noct never actively resists his destiny. Hes scared of it and avoids things that remind him of it as a result of that fear but he never really questions his responsibilities or tries to shirk his duties the way coming of age protagonists usually do. And in the end whats important isnt so much that he grew as a person as that he suffered. Its a very different way of conceptualizing things.See thats exactly why I think the game is poorly written and has a weak narrative because the story cant be told coherently enough. I thought of another example to illustrate this which is The Fountain. The reason why I mention The Fountain is that while I agree Donnie Darko is in many ways a coming of age story or has a good blend between what you call agape love romance and coming of age presented to the viewer in a cohesive narrative The Fountain is actually explicitly a love story. And even in The Fountain even though it is made very clear at some point that it is not so much about mortal romance as much as it is the romance for god or agape love it is still very much presentable as a mortal romance and simultaneously agape love. Because the way I see the alternate universe in Donnie Darko is not so much some alternate universe in the traditional sense of being something caused by his own free will or choice of not heeding the call as much as I see it as a purgatory because Donnie identifies with the material realm. As long as Donnie refuses to accept his place in the spiritual world and seeks the goodness of the mortal plane because it makes him happy he will forever endlessly be stuck in the tangent universe and the reason I say that is because it was not a choice of Donnies to wake up that one day but it was the dead Frank that made him sleep walk and get out of bed. But how did Frank do that before he died? That seems to suggest that this has already happened before and the oblivion which is the destruction of all things is more so due to lack of acceptance of Donnies own suffering by identifying with the material realm kind of similar to how the main character in The Fountain keeps suffering because of his inability to accept death. Symbolically speaking the supposed oblivion is only the oblivion of the material world not necessarily the spiritual though we are never presented what the spiritual world is like in Donnie Darko. And the Fountain is certainly not a comingofage story or has any elements of it which Donnie does. The point Im trying to make is that I think FFXV had been so much better if told similar to Donnie Darko. It already shares elements of Donnie Darko so why not go all the way? Donnie Darko shows that the kind of narrative FFXV seemingly tries to be can be done in a cohesive way that can be very popular among people and a younger audience despite sometimes extremely abstract and confusing. Donnie Darko shows that you can have romance involved and it can be told in a believable way despite the protagonist also needing to sacrifice himself and be in extreme suffering while doing so. I also dont think Donnie Darko quite fits the idea of heros journey which is the archetypal structure for comingofage stories because while it shares some narrative similarities which I think lends to its popularity because it creates a structure that is easier to understand and feels less overtly religiously abstract the conclusion is antithetical of what the heros journey represents imo. The reason for this lies in Donnies own reaction where he ends up sitting on his bed laughing before he dies not out of happiness but out of desperation. The desperation that he ends up dying alone and the desperation that he must not because he wants to. That is why it is ultimately an agape story to me or how to put it than just a typical comingofage story. A much better example of a similar conclusion i.e. the erasure of the protagonist but is clearly told in a comingofage way is FFX where Tidus disappears. But as the story progresses Tidus changes and grows as a person and he matures. He is happy to accept his burden because he made an impact and change to those around him. That Tidus disappears is a symbolic way of saying that Tidus managed to transcend his current development age and he transitioned into becoming an adult. Thusly theres no way adolescent Tidus can exist anymore because Tidus by and large have resolved his inner conflicts with his father and can therefore move on to live life as an adult and a potential father himself. The player while finding this sad accepts this as it is a logical conclusion of the narrative. In contrast the logical narrative of Donnie Darko would we have something like  years after would be something like the initial setup in Fight Club with the main protagonist being so out of it hes essentially not able to embody himself in the world anymore. A kind of mental purgatory if you will. Donnie didnt die happy because of the supposed goodness his call brought the world. He never really came to terms with anything or resolved some inner struggle within himself outside of potentially accepting that we all one day have to die. Thats why Donnie Darko is such a deeply religious movie despite only really delving into religion in two particular scenes. In some ways its similar to The Seventh Seal. In that regard The Fountain is a far more positive movie because he ultimately accepts his loss and comes to terms with the idea of mortality but that death is not the end. ,FFXV,dg044i8,1,t5_2uk8i

When I did finally make it to Chapter  I slapped the nixperience band on Noctis binged on Lasagna del Forno and hoarded EXP all through the Randolph and Menace Beneath Lucis quests. Still I fell about  million exp short to meet the . million necessary before sleeping in Altissia to hit the level  cap.I played FFXV later than most didnt start it until February and while I did do the Cactuar Timed Quest I didnt realize at the time how much exp I was missing out on by not repeating it until after it had finished. I bookmarked this post a while ago thinking it might be useful to me once I reached end game I did do the Wyvern hunt a few times with the ring but A I wouldve had to do it upwards of a hundred times to reach the  cap and B having Gladios double item survival skill available to me I was swimming in rare coins.So I opted for your approach and HOLY MOLY it was breeze! Maybe the Wyvern method is fastermore efficient but this one was inarguable far less of a grind and much more entertaining to do. Also it was really gratifying to see my exp go up by a solid K ever time I did it so I knew exactly how many more times I needed to complete it before I reached my objective. Im now sitting at over . million exp and fully prepared to cash it all in at the Leville! I also still have around  rare coins left so Ill be saving those ifwhen they raise the level cap again.

11748004,0,t3_67mr1x,I saw a post about that picture here I think a month ago. It seemed pretty real the Twitter page where I found it dont remember what the users name was had a bunch of other model pictures and apparently that Twitter page was known to find models in games. He even had a naked picture of the leader of Altissia dont remember her name or title. Personally Im still waiting for Versus XIII placeholder outfits to be equipable in the game.,FFXV,dgrnz0u,2,t5_2uk8i

11767687,0,t1_dgtvloa,Well Im not a game developer and truthfully Im not a hardcore gamer either. I am admittedly not up to date on the trends of the industry.What I will say though is that I respectfully disagree with your view on why achievements exist. The competition aspect is one component of it sure but Ive always achieved platinum trophies solely for my own satisfaction and sense of accomplishment.Take for instance FFXI got  in that game not as bragging rights to rub in the face of my friends but because it satisfied my completionist neurosis. So I see platinum trophies as the modern version of  completions with nary a pvp competition in sight.,FFXV,dgtwc1a,7,t5_2uk8i
