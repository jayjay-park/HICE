If youre a propaganda outlet who will only play along to the prearranged script you get to interview the president thats why. How can you even ask such stupid questions? Do you not think things through on your own?gt No this is how the video would gogt Zach why are you a war monger who kills innocent people?No this is how the video would goZach so Id like to take this opportunity to address your involvement in major welldocumented crimes against the American people your furtherance of all the criminal Bush policies you pretended to oppose and your responsibility for the mass murder of innocent people and american servicemen in conflicts based on admitted lies.Obama can say whatever he wants there is no graceful  propaganda response to someone confronting him with the truth in what he thought was a controlled interview or Im not here to talk about reality lets just make me look good thanx.That would be the ultimate joke on American audiences anyway who are so thoroughly propagandized already that they dont really think this through much.Its propaganda you dont want to admit it for some reason but that doesnt change what it is. Its a controlled environment where the representative of people raping and murdering the world overviolating the rights of basically everyone in America gets cast as familyfriendly and isnt asked any meaningful questions about his involvement in massive ongoing criminal enterprises which effect our whole society while in the mean time he gets to play a nice guy.

1000825,0,t1_chhw36v,Edited the text to make it a little easier to readgtSoutheast Alaska forecast discussion National Weather Service Juneau AK  AM AKDT Tue May  gt.Short Term...picking a model of choice for the day is a little like speeddating too little timeinformation to make up the mind leading to regrets by the end of the dateshift. The American NAM is modern detailoriented prolific willing if a little impetuous and incredibly reactionary. The American GFSthe model next doorquite old fashioned an open book easy on the eyes if a little staid at times. Always talking about the future while whitewashing the present. The Canadian sometimes a little proEuropean sometimes a little pro American...many times hard to read but often has a sunnier outlook than the others. Too sunny sometimes. And that European one...intelligent trend setting and alluring only appearing twice a daymakes me want more. And today I wanted more again so I made my selection. But sometimes I look back and wonder what could have been.gtWere watching a second system if yesterdays was the first...marching northward towards the eastern gulf. The GFS has been advocating its greater strength the European not as worried about it. Ahead of it the first front is now disappearing over the central gulf and likely went aloft overnight across the northern panhandle but it left a tongue of slightly cooler air aloft which supported a few showers overnight across much of the panhandle...these moving northwest on radarsatellite images. The next system should quickly restabilize the atmosphere and allow the showery precip to become steadier rain first in the south this morning and moving to all but Lynn canalnortheast gulf through late afternoon. Due to the possibility of a little more southeasterly winds that sport a questionable easterly component across the mountains characterized rain as light for Juneau for this afternoon. It should be noted though that the NAM is keeping things dry here this afternoon...but discounted this opinion...seemed slow at moving system northward...but oh yeah did NAM get the showers right overnight better than the rest. Again regrets? See above. As low moves northward all the models bring the rain northward even into Lynn canal area through the night and QPF is increased too allowing us to drop the light characterization. Some cooler air makes its way wrapping around the low into the southern panhandle late Tuesday night...thus allowing for precipitation here to turn more showery but a wave behind it may make this indiscernible so left it as stratiform. As the low moves north winds will increase particularly down south to SCA for Clarence this morning Sumnersouthern Chatham this afternoon...and cross sound this evening. Some higher gusts may be experienced today for  as the day progresses into the evening. Even Juneau could go  to  mph late tonight but kept it  to  for this package...its no longer winter. Meanwhile...Yakutat still enduring the early summer drought as offshore flow keeping the precip out even as some mid to high level clouds will pepper its skies.Did cool some temperatures for the northern panhandle...where have rain moving in late in the afternoon. Warmed some temperatures Tuesday night...again as temperatures shouldnt cool that much given mixing and cloud cover. Overall these wont matter much. Its the rain that people are concerned with.gtAnd as I take my European date on my way...NAM whispers...you wont need an umbrella in Juneau...and winks my way. But I will wear my raincoat...but wonder if NAM is right.gt.Long Term...blocky upper air pattern will persist into the weekend. Upper high will remain over SW AK with a ridge axis extending E into NRN SE AK. A low over the ERN gulf will dissipate there Wed night...with a high pressure ridge building over the gulf for late week. By late week...most systems will remain well away from the area. This will set up a drier and warmer pattern for late week. Ended up generally staying the course with the previous forecast...except did make some temp and sky cover changes for ThuFri...and some temp tweaks for early next week as upper TROF will likely dig into the gulf as upper high retreats WWD into the Bering sea.gtFor Wed and Wed night...still some leftover precip with low over the ERN gulf although it will gradually diminish thru the period. Precip will become more showery wed night as slightly cooler air aloft moves in.For Thu...expect drying out as flow becomes more NWLY and ridge aloft nudges in from the w. Inverted TROF will develop from the SE with SFC ridge developing over the gulf. There may be a few leftover showers early in the day along the central area...but should see most places clear out to some degree and temps warm up into the s most areas.gtFor Thu night into sat...looking like generally warm days and cool nights with plenty of sunshine. Temps on Fri may reach the s in a few areas. May be a small push of marine air from the se that could bring in some clouds and a few showers to the far SERN area by Sat...otherwise sat temps should at least get well into the s most inland areas. Ended up warming temps a bit for Fri after a fairly cool start in the morning. There is a chance that frost headlines may be needed in some areas for Thu night. Fri night should not be as cold as Thu night so less threat for frost.gtFor the remainder of the period...looking cooler with increasing threat for rain early next week as upper TROF develops over the gulf. Models have been casting about on timing when the TROF will develop as well as how deep it will be...but model consensus suggests TROF should be established over the gulf by Mon. Kept the pops and clouds as is but did lower max temps some due to increased likelihood of onshore flow.gt.AJK WatchesWarningsAdvisories... Public...none.

1094544,1,t1_chsovwy,Access and treatment are two very different things. As someone who grew up in a middle class American family with mental health problems I can tell you this from experience.  In the US mental health problems are often treated very differently than in other countries. Its a matter of national perception.  Myself and two of my younger cousins all have a form of autism we all live in middle class households with access to excellent mental health coverage a showed symptoms from a very early age and yet all recived different forms of treatment.  I am the oldest of my generation of the family by almost  years was treated for my problems from a very early age such that by the time I reached adulthood I no longer need to see anyone on a regular basis.  My oldest cousin nd cousin technically showed signs of the same condition I was diagnosed with from the age of three months.  Unlike my parents who went with a more traditionally European approach to mental health her mother went with the approach seen more often in the US far too often unfortunately.  She was in denial there couldnt be anything wrong with her little girl that would be a weakness a death sentence and she believed that as long as she didnt take my cousin to the doctor that would be true.  So my cousin grew up and was never treated until she was in college and got it herself.  Luckily all three of us have the same highfunctioning version.  My third and youngest cousin is almost  now and his mother decided to blame vaccines because in the US that is not universally considered fucktard insane.  She accepts his condition but will not allow him to get treatment.  He hasnt gotten any additional vaccines since the age of  or so and his younger sister has none.  So I dont know if in this particular instance he was recieving treatment or not but I do know that if he was someone somewhere fucked up.,humor,chspce0,5,t5_2qh34

That should be decent enough incentive surely. gtexplain how that requirement would have prevented the UCSB shootingCant say that it would for sure. You never know though. The police officer might have picked up on something while visiting his house. Its silly to expect one single requirement to stop all spree killings.

Because the government is literally trying to get kids to eat their vegetables and classifying these things as vegetables helps them look like theyre meeting their targets.

So if users want to bittorrent content and suck up all the band width for all other customers  of users use up  of the bandwidth the ISP has to let them.Certain realtime applications such as streaming video e.g. YouTube telephony services e.g. Skype and multiplayer gaming require that data packets stream smoothly without interruption. In order for these applications to stream smoothly and therefore function as intended an ISP might give their data packets priority over those of movie downloads or email for which smooth streaming is not essential.

2769987,0,t1_cniulsv,Prepare yourself you asked for this.  Large blocks of text ahead!I dont think I have issue admitting fault as much as admitting defeat in arguments.  Mostly because I dont know Im wrong as quick as most people.If I have done something wrong at work I own up to it and say Hey I hard reset a git repo and lost a handful of our uploads.  I fucked up! or Hey that issue your fighting with was because I coded this stupidly and should have done it another way.  I have no issues admitting that Ive done something wrong.  In my field and most likely most others you get used to being wrong pretty quick and its very much like you described admit fault and move on promptly so you can learn from it.What I have a hard time doing is letting an argument go when I know Im right.  Sometimes Im wrong about knowing Im right though if that makes any sense.  It takes me a longer time to understand where I was wrong than other people.  I also personally feel like my rightwrong ratio is higher than average but Im probably wrong about that too. One of the big things that leads to this quirk personally is that Im an extremely patient person and have spent tons of time in political discussions that I know arent going to change the other persons opinion and I know they arent going to change mine.  But I enjoy the discussion and learning where the other person is coming from.  I dont get heated in arguments and really enjoy when I meet someone like myself with different viewpoints because we can argue about things shake hands and go on with our lives.  It is rare though. Picture me as the drunk person that wants to argue with you about religion except I dont get ever get angry throw up on your shoes and stumble out of the bar calling you a queer.However this isnt a bad skill for lack of a better word to have.  I have an older client who calls me on a weekly basis to help him with basic IT work.  I just had a long discussion with him over why documents that he opened from email attachments are showing up in recent items for his office suite. His previous contractors that helped him would tell him BECAUSE THATS HOW IT IS.  He would feel like shit for not understanding he would hate the technology he was using and he would feel helpless and fire them.  Ive been working with this guy for  years.  With me I tell him No this makes complete sense you just have to think of it this way and if that doesnt work Ill approach it from a different angle.  He eventually gets what Im talking about and has less issues and can move forward after learning because Im patient and willing to stand on my point and explain it until it makes sense to him. Yes he sometimes gets frustrated when I tell him something makes sense when he thinks it doesnt and no I dont always win in these arguments but me not giving up and saying Youre right this makes no sense has turned him into a person that can use his word processor to conduct business because he understands things he previously wouldnt have because everyone else gave up on explaining.My wife is a lovely person for putting up with all of this.TLDR  I just dont know when Im wrong and Im patient enough to argue for a long time.  ,humor,cnixr1t,2,t5_2qh34

If you believe there is a meaningful discussion to be had then have it!  Engage! Converse!  Dont feed into the bullshit that both sides of the political spectrum want you to.

I got denied on a lease for an apartment because my nephew who went to look at it for me is very gay. When they saw him they decided not to rent to me. He was not going to live in it. He was simply doing me a favor and looking at a few apts for me.I am not gay but through my wonderful nephew I have lived the discrimination first hand.

7291554,0,t1_d26x7m0,First of all who doesnt like watermelon?Also what I said was more of a sweeping generalization than bigotry. And the whole black people like watermelon stereotype isnt a very apt comparison. It is derived from the significance that watermelon had as a crop to newly freed black slaves. It was a symbol of black resilience and progress before it was twisted to be what it is today. So it doesnt really compare well to modern day Christendom acting like the beleaguered and marginalized underdog when in reality it has been and still is the most popular politically influential and socially relevant religion in the US since its conception. When a people group has views which oppose those of Christianity and demands equal rights and protections under the rule of law it is not an attack on Christianity. In actuality it is preserving the Constitution through application. Much like how the civil rights movement wasnt an attack on white people but rather a application of constitutional rights aimed at ensuring equality for all.And clearly I was referencing the Christians that produced and agree with the movies that this SNL bit is satirizing and therefore when in context isnt really even a sweeping generalization as Christianity being marginalized is the core premise of those films.,humor,d270147,3,t5_2qh34

But unless youre namecalling or going out of your way to insult people then merely stating out loud your religious views or lack thereof should not annoy thoughtful people. When a persons primary reaction to any discussion about atheism especially on a comedy show is to get offended it reveals something very ugly about that person.

None of these pictures rule out the person reflecting on what the monument stands for and in many ways interacting with and personalising your experience of the monument will make it a more lasting memory.Its a monument of a scale and design for people to interact with.

10427369,0,t1_dcpzqfh,If its published in a good journal its a start. But its only one study and we saw the damage that can be done when drawing broad conclusions based on the results of one study. Im referring to Cuddys power pose study specifically which has spawned books and the like even though the results were not successfully replicated. Something like this article is fun to think about and the results are interesting but because the article suggests that this was an exploratory study the results should be taken with a grain of salt. ,humor,dcq0eii,28,t5_2qh34

10795331,0,t1_ddtduho,CNN leans to pro establishment with a predilection for enough hype to drive ratings.  Establishment in this context expressed with an international perspective is basically status quo business centric neoliberal centerright.   The idea that they might be super left can only sound reasonable from the perspective of inside the Washington D.C. beltway or other hyper partisan echo chambers.  Anyone else who might not be from the U.S. and might have at least a smattering of understanding of politics and political history would not label CNN as leftist.,humor,ddtgmkd,264,t5_2qh34
