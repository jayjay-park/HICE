6537541,0,t1_czviqp0,Hi! Thanks for your fantastic reply. I did read that I could volunteer as a nonUS citizen but great to get another confirmation. Are there any townscities in Texas that are considered more walkpublic transportfriendly? Yes Louisiana is on the th have always wanted to go to New Orleans. Yes Ill probably continue until the New York primary thats where Ill most likely fly out of on the th of April although looking at the schedule it seems the primary may be wrapped up on the th of March because Ohio Illionois Florida Missouri and North Carolina all have their primaries then a big amount of the delegates is that fair to assume? But yes if you could suggest other states that would be great.,TexasForSanders,czvj96x,2,t5_380yd

6645237,0,t3_46mu8f,Oy. I found theres all sorts of different requirements in different states... The TX campaign offices and any supporters who already have signs ought to pick up a cheap labelmaker and add that sentence at the bottom of the signs!The required sentence isNOTICE IT IS A VIOLATION OF STATE LAW CHAPTERS  AND  TRANSPORTATION CODE TO PLACE THIS SIGN IN THE RIGHTOFWAY OF A HIGHWAY.,TexasForSanders,d06obj4,3,t5_380yd

6835321,0,t1_d0qud1q,I cant tell if youre joking but here is the data for the Texas primary with  votes cast for Clinton and  cast for Sanders. Completely ignoring district lines Clinton took the popular vote nearly .Even including Travis and Hays every win for Bernie was tenuous several by one or two votes and more than half with him receiving less than  of the vote while many of the wins for Clinton were in the  range. I want Sanders to win too but deluding ourselves does nothing for us.,TexasForSanders,d0r32zp,3,t5_380yd
6980350,0,t1_d16cdo3,You do bring up some valid points. Ultimately there will be pros and cons related to the construction of the pipeline and not every person opposed to it will have the best of arguments. Some arguments though arent necessarily ignorance.One of the biggest conflicts that the residents are having is the use of eminent domain. Texas has very lax rules and most oil companies have no issues just taking land they need. Because the pipeline is going directly through Alpine rather than around it a lot of the residents that live on ranches around the town have found surveyors on their land that didnt even notify the residents. These residents want to challenge these rules and have full control over their land arguing that the pipeline isnt a public benefit as the money only goes to the oil producers since oil itself is going to MexicoAlso a lot of people just dont want the oil business down throughout the Big Bend region. Odessa Midland and the other towns of the north are consumed by the oil market and the residents of the region really want to keep the pipeline out as they see it as the start of a domino effect.And as far as I understand it I may be incorrect the TransPecos pipeline could potentially be stopped by the federal government. Texas government has deemed it an instate only pipeline therefore giving the state govt the highest jurisdiction however because it goes through to Mexico the national government could claim that its interstate and therefore earn supreme jurisdiction over it.,TexasForSanders,d17k7z0,1,t5_380yd
