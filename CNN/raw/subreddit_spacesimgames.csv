I dont like it.Developers these days have no clue what there doing they should just remake Freelancer.....Anyways my last hope is Limit Theory at least that guy seems like he knows what hes doing.,spacesimgames,cfahjip,0,t5_2u6r8
1269207,0,t1_cibwuf2,Kickstarted that as soon as I saw it a week ago.  ,spacesimgames,cicehut,1,t5_2u6r8
1883499,0,t3_2g5tdz,The video was pretty . . . at first. after about the  minute mark it was tired.Too many scams on Kickstarter. Fairly or not it makes me think of everything as a scam. This video didnt help.,spacesimgames,ckg5jsm,1,t5_2u6r8
2778765,0,t1_cnj3yvd,The goal is for the game to be essentially DCS AC Warthog in space. Basically complex systems startup for the ship battery generator engine etc. alongside the combat missions and onfoot walking around your ship and stations. There are some really ancient videos of pre alpha cockpit management that are really cool on YouTube. Hope this helps clarify. ,spacesimgames,cnjxpqt,2,t5_2u6r8

3713980,0,t1_cqfm2se,Oh well then i guess ill keep working on the game without any funds and when i can make a video of it ill launch the campaign again.  but i figured the whole idea was to help people make their ideas a reality. ,spacesimgames,cqfmbg7,3,t5_2u6r8
4013934,0,t1_crdbve9,Yea this is made with Unity. I just made a linux build! You can find the download link in this pageI hope it works for you ,spacesimgames,crdtibh,1,t5_2u6r8
5636459,0,t1_cvw2dca,The best games out there  even not so great  go through  years often  to  years even of development.  of that time is spent developing the game in prealpha to alpha states of which we as gamers never EVER see. Of course things are going to be unimpressive and very unfinished in SC.The upcoming very soon to come actually Alpha . release will have more functional pieces to play with but it will still be alpha broken and probably unimpressive to the likes of you. If you arent impressed yet as you put it you should wait until retail release because you just wont understand why youre playing a broken and unfinished thing.,spacesimgames,cwvr8qu,1,t5_2u6r8

10191411,0,t3_5lx8ja,Theres a great game for  and PS called Project Sylpheed The story is filled with FFstyle schlocky drama but its not terrible by any means. The game offers a wide variety of weapons with different play styles and the battlefields are massive. If youve ever heard the phrase Macross missile massacre this game takes it in stride.For PC a good modern title is House of the Dying Sun This game is lighter on story but has some of the best atmosphere and sound design Ive ever seen in a space combat game. I just absolutely love all the little sounds and alerts as you fly combined with the muffled sound of your guns firing into the vacuum of space.,spacesimgames,dbz94ch,3,t5_2u6r8
11042570,0,t3_5xd71s,Children of a Dead Earth is set in our solar system. Its pitched as The most scientifically accurate space warfare simulator ever made and some have described it as like KSP with guns which is sorta accurate. ,spacesimgames,dejnmh5,2,t5_2u6r8
11152652,0,t3_5yniy5,In terms of the scale of space Elite Dangerous! In terms of fighter craft Its honestly a toss up between House of the Dying Sun and Freespace ! There is something about the sound in HotDS that makes me feel like Im there something I hadnt felt in a space sim since FS.Just my two cents...,spacesimgames,dew53fb,1,t5_2u6r8
