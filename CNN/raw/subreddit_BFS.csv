2976639,0,t1_co6fv38,Haha Yep. Up until yesterday this sub was a sub for Bowling For Soup fans hence BFS. It had never been used and was abandoned so I requested it and got it yesterday. Hopefully it will see a lot more action as a benign fasciculation sub than it did as a bowling for soup sub. ,BFS,co6gkcv,1,t5_2tlhk
