301106,0,t3_1wv4nn,My next build is going to be lightweight.I havent started to really dig around for parts but in my light scouring I noticed something interesting.From what Ive seen so far CF hand guards are not the lightest option.I know you didnt mention CF but I just thought Id throw that out there because it was kind of counterintuitive to me.So far Im planning TnA poly lower flat top upper minus FA thin barrel and one of those ugly L shaped stocks.Just playing around with the AR gunstruction thing I was able to get sub lbs.The main detriment I expect with a light build is increased felt recoil but recoil from semiauto . is pretty much a nonissue unless youre competing. I also imagine a thin barrel may factor into accuracy but I dont know to what degree.,Gunbuilds,cfbz4ou,1,t5_2t48h

1704805,0,t3_2dwlwn,From what I hear timing the barrel is the most difficult part. If youre not equipped with the receiver wrench and whatever materials needed to shave either the barrel or the receiver youre gonna have to take it into a gunsmith. ,Gunbuilds,cju1wnq,2,t5_2t48h

8644742,0,t1_d6l8h9b,You need a barrel as well.  I got one from green mountain though several places make them.  Also check out Robertrtg.com for good surplus parts and parts kits.,Gunbuilds,d6m7ck4,1,t5_2t48h
10139461,0,t1_dbt5qw7,Not in PA sorry.  Good luck though.  Everything Ive read on HK builds makes me want to cry at how difficult it will be.  Ive slated my MPK PDW to be done early March so I can keep you updated.  Just remember HKs moto,Gunbuilds,dbt6coc,2,t5_2t48h

11657385,0,t1_dggqbeb,Was this with the . frame? Also did you mill the slide cut outs higher up or lower on the jig? Any issues or tips? I heard that the picket for the disconnecter sits a little high is that true? I bought one yesterday and it comes in Friday super excited. Yours looks great!,Gunbuilds,dghdnns,1,t5_2t48h
