2559896,0,t1_cm7aaw9,Honestlywarship design in the Honorverse really depends on mass availability and power generation. Fighters dont have the mass for beta nodes  or for a powerful enough generator to power beta nodes  which means that everything but a cutter or cargo shuttle would be able to easily outrun them. Heck pinnaces and the RMNs Javelin trainers use what sound like jet turbine engines  to me that says that for atmospheric use there really arent any better options. Worse they dont have the masspower to mount weapons heavy enough to do appreciable damage to anything bigger than a cutter. So in an antishipping role I agree the closest were going to see to fighters is the LACs.Now this having been said since we have seen stingships described as having a military role Id bet that there are probably Manticoran Army units that use stingship squadrons in an air superiority and close air support role. If they can shoot down pinnaces and assault shuttles tactically theyd be extremely useful to keep reinforcements off a planets surface andor keeping units from moving too quickly.,Honorverse,cmspro6,2,t5_2xx2e
