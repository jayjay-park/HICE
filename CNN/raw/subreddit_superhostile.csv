I think a system that allows more players to have a chance at the charms will solve any problems. Vechs can still make the time the charms are available random if he implemented like  or  hour periods during the day where one luck charm could appear. That way there is still a challenge involved and players can attempt the challenge no matter what time of the day they play.,superhostile,d36sop3,1,t5_2u8g6

Ill trade you lotsa axes for tripwire hooks haha. I need to fish but i just cant stand it. I didnt mind as much in older mc before the bubbles but something about the new mechanic makes it harder actually to time it. I keep right clicking every time the thing moves as a reflex from the old days instead of waiting for bubbles. The pufferfish was caught during a lag spike so you kinda rubber banded to a point in time before you had caught it I think. I cant believe I watched you fish though. I think you reeled me in by restoring the happy rock song  ,superhostile,d45shdr,1,t5_2u8g6
