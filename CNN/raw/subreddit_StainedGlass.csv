4089943,0,t3_37cdx5,Ive been doing stained glass for over  years.  The only reasons I can think of that would cause cracking while soldering is shape of the individual piece does not look like your issue  I mean hourglass pieces or VERY thin pieces or heat.  Either too high temperature holding the iron on one spot for too long or going over a particular spot too many time in a short amount of time.  Surface doesnt matter although obviously it should be perfectly flat although a hard surface can scratch the solder joint.  I use a damp towel.  That also can prevent solder from running through.  Anyway heat.  Lower your iron incrementally.  Try  then  etc until you no longer get cracks.  OR...  If its your technique dont leave your iron in one spot for long and if you need to go over a spot allow it to cool for a short bit maybe  seconds before you touch the iron to it again.  Best of luck!,StainedGlass,crmh88t,2,t5_2r4xk

5664261,0,t1_cwz1uo3,Thank you. I was confused because I have read a comment in the DIY sub that stated for the copper foil method the solder iron must be able to heat up to  degrees.,StainedGlass,cwz7gb8,2,t5_2r4xk

7081969,0,t1_d1i95bq,Doesnt the water from the grinder mess with the paper?  I am using card stock but still seems like the paper would deteriorate quickly.,StainedGlass,d1j3uic,1,t5_2r4xk
