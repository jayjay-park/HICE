Likewise not everyone can afford to buy renewable power generators nor does everyone live in houses that are suitable for such generators. Still some people will support the environment by contributing to voluntary renewable energy sales. The current laws allow these people to be ripped off by the renewable energy salesmen.

1752198,0,t3_2ege9a,I am in Chicago area and know many of the PV installers here  I have even trained a few.  I and an installer put a . kW system in on my own house last year for . and collected  in rebate and tax credit.  Wow!  I put in a similar system on a neighbors house  years ago and the completed price was !  So take the advice posted by kludgefactory and get in while the getting is good.  It is very unlikely you will zero out your ANNUAL sum for electric bill.  Of course for some particular day or month you may.  Net metering in Illinois is like it is in most states  If you do by golly generate more than you use by the end of your billing year the surplus will apply to the following billing period or year.  But after another year any surplus from that then previous year disappears.  You should also look at signing on for RRTP residential real time pricing with ComEd.  I did so  years ago and have saved about  on my costs without making much of any adjustment to my energy use.  ComEd would not allow combining both the Net Metering agreement and RRTP for several years but they do now.  Also the Illinois rebate for PV  though it is open for new applicants at the moment is fickle.  It may close soon and will stay closed until more money accrues in time.  Your contractor should be able to coach you on timing etc. in this regard.  Lastly there is no selling of your REC available to individual homeowners in Illinois at this time but keep an eye on the ISEA program for aggregating RECs.  In the past they were the only authorized agent in Illinois to pay you for your RECs and they may be able to start doing so again or direct you on how to do it.  Last time they were able to payout they paid about  per Megawatthour.  Your . mW system is likely to be able to produce between  and  mWhper year which once had value of  to  free incomeyear.,solar,ck00tsk,1,t5_2qq8l

I dont know what SDGampE currently pays but if they change it or ban people from doing it at all this is a possibility in locations with heavy solar saturation like Southern CA SolarCity is going to have a bunch of pissed off customers that they have to answer to.,solar,cr92tkv,1,t5_2qq8l

4025232,0,t1_cre6ael,At a local distribution level the investment in cabling transformers switchgear etc has already been made and the financial issue is having the funding to service the debt to pay off the installation costs.  Its not widely appreciated that the cost of a power system is determined by the peak load whereas the revenue generated is related to the actual load.  So if the metered electricity counts go down then the rate per KWh will eventually have to rise to service the debt.The other interesting issue is the amount of frequency keeping necessary for a system with solar on it.  Because of annoying issues like clouds the output of an areas solar production is not constant and sometimes the sun will go in as the load drops and sometimes the sun will go in as the load rises.  So the impact on frequency keeping plant will be bigger an out half the time and small the other half.  So frequency keeping might become worse.Hawaii electric have new rules around solar system behaviour in frequency excursions which if adopted widely would reduce frequency excursions on systems with high intermittent generation either solar andor wind.,solar,crf3txx,2,t5_2qq8l

4101252,0,t1_crnnwfx,There are a couple of different styles of PWM solar charge controllers. The basic is to make sure its a three stage controller that will shut off when the battery is full and then turn back on the instant it needs a charge. I couldnt find a manual to show me at what levels it charges the battery but it did say it shut off at .v. Im not convinced that your controller is a PWM  I have pulled up several pages and the user manual  there is no mention of any stages or what the charging function looks like. I pulled up this page for SMF battery type  looks like your battery is a WET type battery but its sealed. So the upper charge voltage for that battery will likely be . or .v  that controller will work to charge the battery without overcharging or charging at a higher voltage than recommended. A simple way to see whats happening with your system is to find a voltmeter that can be wired in. Learn what voltage battery means and ensure that youre getting fully charged every so often based on your usage. You could even go a step further and get another controller that has the volt and amp readout of the system but if you were just to check voltage you can tell how full the battery is. ,solar,crnrnpv,0,t5_2qq8l

It is questionable if this holds especially in colder climates. They seem to be comparing it with the worst guaranteed case for the average panel on the market which had already been greatly surpassed by even ancient thirty five years old panels in Scandinavia where almost immeasurable degradation was observed. The best case for consumer and worst case for SunPower perhaps is that most if not all noncrappy panels will degrade only very slightly in nontropic conditions.To me it seems that the best market for SunPower panels is in the US simply for the reason of nonpanel costs dominating to the extent that SunPower panels either wont increase the total price markedly or actually might save some labor cost perhaps.

In the winter when we dont generate much electricity due to weather and short days we dont have to pay peak rates.The new rate schedule moves peak hours from afternoon to evening ALL YEAR. This means solar owners will now get paid offpeak rates when they are selling to the grid and pay peak rates when they are buying from the grid.  This will result in very high electricity bills for solar owners between NovFeb and eliminate credits which most solar owners currently accrue during the summer months.In other words right now we buy low and sell high.

I question whether anything will be done to deliberately stop or erode it. Perhaps it doesnt get increased support and subsidy that it might have with a different election outcome but I dont think there will be a conscious effort to kill it. More may be done to revitalize fossil but I am not expecting the death of clean energy.

10225523,0,t3_5mfbmq,I keep reading opinions about how Trump wants to eviscerate clean energy. But to me there are a lot of reasons why you could just as easily guess his administration will target competing in the field.To me the biggest factor is not allowing China to win.Next is the fact the a big red state TX and a big blue state CA among others are still pushing to grow to different degrees. NY and MA could be added too. I doubt DC will move to interfere and so far isnt showing signs of wanting to immediate curtail the ITC  which did after all get a lot of buyin across the aisle.Not really trying to start or continue the political discussion. Just highlighting that there is ample reason to see reasons why clean energy continues to get support. That support may shift some from retail to RampD but its my opinion that would be good. The more we can outinnovate China Taiwan etc. the better for the industry. Especially if it helps areas like storage.

10404619,0,t1_dcndjso,gt On deregulated grids absent of netmetering laws you have retail electric providers offering netmetering to their customers. Ill reference Reliant in Texas as an example. That says alot about the economics of netmetering.There are also jurisdictions that dont do net metering at all reminding customers that energy they self generate and use is valued at the retail rate. gt The netmetered customer still pays a meter fee which should adequately cover their overhead and distribution usage. If a solar customer only uses . of the grid then why should they pay  of distribution costs?Because by law at least in southern Nevada where NV Energy operates for a dwelling to be considered habitable being connected to the grid is required. It doesnt matter if the usage is  or . you pay into the installation maintenance and operation of the grid. Consider what would happen if one entity owned just the generating facilities and a different entity owned the distribution lines and equipment. Customers with on site generation that contributed with net metering would still have to pay at least the distribution entity to be connected and if they tried to use the generating entity as a battery theyd have to pay them for electricity at night too.  Economies of scale utility rights of way encumbrances on property deeds building and electrical code and state sponsoreddu jure monopolies and all that other stuff that gets conveniently ignored in these quick little discussions. Why shouldnt net metering customers get charged for using the grid in both directions one fee for buying electricity and another for pushing some back into the grid? Why shouldnt net metering generated electricity be purchased at the wholesale rate by NVE?,solar,dcnfikm,1,t5_2qq8l

But since their early premature? press about developing the technology I dont recall seeing much more about the product. However they have been very active in that time frame buying developersinstallers and operating that end of the business. I assumed it was a way to survive while also creating a pseudovertical. Where once their D product was commercially viable they had the infrastructure to market sell and install. Pretty common for the industry. Not always successful as there is only so much revenue you can divert from an otherwise viable business segment.I cant be sure but I also thought they were originally suggesting the most anticipated application was utility scale projects.

10896599,0,t1_de3quw4,I am not sure how to parse this article either. But sticking to known facts here is how I think this relates to credit score. Solarcity installs a system on a house and expects the owner to pay them monthly for yrs. Problem is that average ownership is yrs.The credit risk is on average over three home owner and they only vet out the first one.  So in theory Solarcity has system that are approaching yr so they are about to get into this st wave of unvetted owner... I think home buyers have negotiating power even if the house is not in foreclosure as solarcity is generally an uninvited seat at the negotiating table. Potential buyer should straight out refuse to deal with Solarcity and put it on the current owner to resolve the conflict.  and that makes a house with a PPA on it much harder to sell for the asking price. The only thing that should be transferred once a house is sold is the system warranty.,solar,de3wnrt,2,t5_2qq8l

Says customers are buying more than leasing. But again that was based on the twisting of the definition of ownership that is inherent in our legal system. Because buying solar systems with a bank loan may make you a legal owner but in reality you dont own shit because miss some payments and it gets taken away from you as if it werent your property.
