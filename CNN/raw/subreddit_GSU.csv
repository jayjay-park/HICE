172410,0,t3_1w20tn,Starting with Parking and Transportation would be the correct method. It is always nicer and certainly less stress inducing on the department if you talk to them before going straight to the top. If you can go talk to them about it I think you will find that they are more than willing to listen to your concerns. However you may have to make sure you talk to someone other than the people at the front counter. Ask for Joanie Greenlees or Kristi Bryant. Joanie may be a better person to start with. Dont go into it with the idea of filing a complaint or being passive aggressive as that generally negates the point you are trying to make. Be logical mention that it affects your student experience negatively and ask them if there is anything they can do about the noise be persistent but dont be an ass. Generally the people that parking deals with when a complaint is being made are very loud and very aggressive. If you are nice about it they are far more willing to help.Keep in mind Parking doesnt run the buses an outside company does. But Parking and Transportation and that company have a very tight relationship. The alarms may be something that is hardwired into the bus and isnt easily removedmade less noisy and shutting the bus off every time the bus drivers swap would not be efficient. Getting a change made may require a bit of time.If none of that works I would try taking it to Housing Parking and Housing are under the same division  and Housing can be rather persuasive if not annoying at times. ,GSU,cey2j4f,2,t5_2rjzr
