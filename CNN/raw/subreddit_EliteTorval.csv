4303110,0,t1_csaitzo,Regira is being discussed but please dont push it as of yet we are looking at a unified strategic plan and trying not to spread resources... we have tough fights coming on  possibly  fronts as LHS  has upset winters supporters and Niccolos has upset Hudson Supporters... but all to funny watch them figure out what happened.edit spelling,EliteTorval,csaoofj,2,t5_38hpi

I wait with excitment to the answer so we can commence activities asap. I like to know what your leadership thinks of your actions a servant deciding the fate of our two Emperial factions.,EliteTorval,ct0kzd3,0,t5_38hpi

4901088,0,t1_cucaqw4,well profit per ton no shit the  brings in a bigger hull. this wasnt a whos bigger contest sorry if it came off like that. im just saying if you could find your own trade rout up here that brings in more than k the distance you would have to travel might be less and therefor the loop is completed faster faster  more money. but each to his own i guess.,EliteTorval,cucbjtk,1,t5_38hpi
4943102,0,t1_cuhhnzf,I dont just sit there and wait to get shot up. Basically what happens is. I rack up a bounty.  Laziness dictates that its too much to pay and i cant be arsed.If i dont die from being overzealous in CZs or flying crap like i usually do and crashing highspeed into the mailslot i always panic when being scannedThen ill mention in passing that i have a bounty to frienfs and people i come across in private mode.  You gotta understand im a solo player.  The chances of me flying with others is rare.If they express intrest in claiming it.  The chase begins and i use it to practice my pvp and they usually end up killing me because they better pilot.Thats it.There isnt any shady scheme going on here lol.  Relax,EliteTorval,cuhm8kf,1,t5_38hpi

5079647,0,t3_3kj5mk,Um.... but I support the senator... and engage in alot of trading. But I also take guilty pleasure in heading over to Archon Delaine systems and melting down Kumo Crew ships...... while the crew is still in them. That doesnt make me evil does it??,EliteTorval,cuyaftt,1,t5_38hpi
