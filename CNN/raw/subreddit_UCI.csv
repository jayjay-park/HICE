691837,0,t3_222zuq,I was a Masters EE grad student at UCI  years ago and had a great time. Some of my favorite things about it All the events and parties hosted by the Associated Graduate Students AGS. There was always plenty of free food and alcohol. Learning from the distinguished and accomplished professors in my department especially in RF and power electronics fields. Broadcom headquarters is near the main campus and theyre always hiring EE grad students at very competitive wages. Vista del Campo was a great place to live albeit one of the more expensive oncampus living options. Fully furnished all utilities covered plenty of amenities available at the community center and some great community events too lots of free food events including a wine tasting seminar. The Anthill Pub was a great place to relax and kill time while on campus. Great place to hang out with classmates and even professors. They had weekly events too like live music and comedy nights. The Anteater Recreation Center ARC. It has plenty of great classes clubs and activities to offer. Ive done taekwondo capoeira sailing rock climbing and intramural tennis,UCI,cgiwwoc,8,t5_2r7xu

1490636,0,t1_cj2zlpt,While you didnt actually phrase your statements as questions here is a responseUCI doesnt snoop VPN connections. The CCAA software does not monitor your VPN either.Tether? Im assuming you meant if you connect to a VPN.. There is a soft cap on the campus wireless of GB per device per  hours however it isnt until you hit higher internal caps that you raise more serious flags. That being said there is no bandwidth usage cap for academic use. Now while we dont see whats inside a VPN tunnel it is easy enough to deduce that there is PP traffic in a tunnel based upon the statistics and traffic of the tunnel session. So while we couldnt see the actual PP traffic we could deduce that it exists. Depending on the bandwidth your pushing and if youre causing a network slow down you may raise flags.So for example if you use say GB on the WiFi to download MATLAB and JSTOR docs that wont raise a worry. If you use the same bandwidth or more purely for a VPN connection that may a flag.Now if youre using any amount of bandwidth to torrent youre automatically raising flags. This is all logged.Generally if you use reasonable amounts of bandwidth and arent maxing out the connection then you are in the clear. That being said UCI takes the misuse of its network resources seriously and investigates instances of abuse and misconduct.edit. You may draw your own conclusions. This advice isnt the opinion of the UC. I dont condone piracy.,UCI,cj34jub,6,t5_2r7xu

2308977,0,t3_2lnd7w,It doesnt sound like it would make a lot of sense for you to enroll in any course through Access UCI.  While attendanceclass participation generally isnt a significant part of your grade you are going to have hard time with the in class quizzesexams.  I have been out of UCI for a while but in my experience the in class exams and quizzes were usually around  of your grade for upper division math classes.  If you cant be in class enough to take most of the quizzes it will be difficult if not impossible to get a passing grade.If you are just looking to review material so that you are better prepared for your masters program I would suggest to just buy the books and review the material on your own.  Thats pretty much what you are going to be doing anyways since you state that you arent going to be able to attend the lectures anyways.  You might also check out some MOOCs like Coursera and edX.  They have some courses that cover material that would be found in a typical upper division math course.  It isnt as helpful as having an experienced professor that can point out what you are doing wrong but it is a lot better than nothing.  ,UCI,clx3tjw,1,t5_2r7xu

I would imagine this is a similar situation except it affects absolutely everybody who took A either last quarter or in previous quarters.TLDR Were all in the same boat  hit up Pearson customer support and see if you can sweet talk your way into receiving a code for B. You would likely have to do the same thing next quarter as well. In the meantime get a  day trial from the mylab website.

I know it happened to me I went from . straight As in high school to getting a few Cs my first quarter I realized that I had to do a lot on my own and after that got either Bs or As in my courses. You will never have it as easy as high school. You have to study on your own. The professors are there to answer your questions and give you a general guideintro to a topic. You have to actually learn most everything on your own.Each class is a certain number of units. If a class is  units you are expected to spend  hour  hours per unit of your own time studying for that class per week. So taking  units you are expected to spend  hours a week leaningstudying for your classes.The most important thing here is that you realized that you need to do better this is a MAJOR step that some people never get before its too late.Now take a deep breath.. things will work out. Learn from the experience dont overload yourself with too many classes next quarter try balance stuff out take GE and major mix. Its much better to take things slower and graduate in  years than try to rush and flunk out.College grades are about being above average not about getting .GPA. If you get an A in your class that means you are one of the best students out of tens of thousands As are reserved for very few.  As long as you do same as average or above on your midterms you will be fine. Almost every class is curved at some point some arent but I think all math classes are curved at the end. So if you do average or better then you are in good shape and will pass.Biggest thing here is that you need to completely stop approaching grades at UCI like you did grades in High School or even a community college those do not work the same way. In high school or some community colleges you are expected to get an A if you understand the material well. At UCI A means you excel in that field of study and are above and beyond of the grasp you are expected to have. This is why some classes when curved will actually lower your grade from A to lets say a B yes a curve can hurt you. Like in an instance where majority of the class are getting As and Bs. Whatever average of the class is curved to be a C. So if everyone is getting a B they will get curved down to a C and your A will become a B. Because the way curriculum is designed is for average to be a C so if average is higher than means the material was too easy which is unfair to other lectures or quarters that taketook the same class.,UCI,d9rukl1,1,t5_2r7xu

10776152,0,t1_ddrfv0p,Hello! I think one of the main things that needs to be addressed right now is homework and lab grades. Its already week  and we have no idea how were doing in the course aside from quizzes which are only  of our grade. I was wondering if you have any information on why we havent seen any of our homework or lab grades? Homework grades in particular since I know that the labs are graded by the TA when you demonstrate them in lab. But I would still like to see with my eyes what my grades are even though I know I got all of my labs checked so far. I also think he needs to be more clear with what he wants from us. One day he says we will never use sep and end for our programs and then suddenly we get in on the quiz. On the slides it says we can use  when dealing with sep and end so I used that on the quiz and got the correct output and still got  points because the professor made an announcement in class that I could not hear because its impossible for  students to hear every word that  professor is saying. If he had just put explicitly on the quiz that we cant use  then there would have been no problem. And now thats the quiz that Im going to have to drop.Again with Klefstad needing to be more clear he says one day that we can finish all of the labs on Wednesday if we want to and then another day he says we cant finish more than one lab each lab day and then now its this new policy where we HAVE to come on Monday and finish a difficult lab in only  hour and if we dont well were screwed.I just feel like the class has been a mess. I guess its understandable since its his first time teaching ICS  but still.Anyways I still feel like I have learned a lot of material nonetheless and the amount of work that has been given to us does pay off since I can do  of the things weve learned so far with ease. But that took a huge and I mean HUGE amount of effort from me. Ive spent whole DAYS doing the homework problems because theyre just that difficult for someone who has never programmed. I would appreciate if you discussed with the other TAs or Professor Klefstad himself the issues I addressed here.Thank you!,UCI,ddrhdjp,1,t5_2r7xu

11172467,0,t3_5zglkh,th year bio major here. A LOT of people come into UCI as a biological sciences major but many end up dropping out. Im estimating .K freshman are bio majors so theres A LOT of spots available. However it is competitive in its nature and there are a lot of great candidates that want to be in the major . avg gpa .K avg SAT extracurriculars . For education Im not entirely too sure. If you really want to secure a spot at UCI your best bet is to apply as a Sociology Major or psych n social behavior and after a quarter of taking classes just the major and switch. You wont be too behind because PsychSocio classes are GEs so your classes will actually count towards completion. HOWEVER if you switch to Bio youre going to be at a huge disadvantage. At UCI biochem classes must be taken in a specific order AND they are only offered once in that quarter. For example the first Bio course you must take is Bio  but its only offered in the fall. So if you do come in as another major and declare Bio later you cant officially start your first Bio course until Summer Session. youll also be behind on chem too and ya gotta take labs. this means that you wont be able to take nd year chem organic chem until later and youre gonna have to cram A LOT of classes. it sucks and the bio structure here is trash. You cannot take bio  until youve taken . Everything is in series and everything is only offered once so dont fail lol.  if your worried about trying to get into UCI prioritize that first. apply for an easy major and go from there. I believe apps are over so Im not sure how you can change the major you apply into. If you are a JR in HS keep working harder and kill the SATyour next semester.Anyways GL with all your endeavors. I hope I was of some help!  ,UCI,deydxry,3,t5_2r7xu

Honestly it has helped me alot as a programmer because of all of the work that he gives you. The inlab exams are a piece of cake and the projects and quizzes are easy because he gives you the selfbatch check file that he uses to check your work which can be super helpful. The only thing that can really bring down your grade is the midterm and final which can go quite indepth because he require you to read the lecture notes in big detail. The only issue is that I do find his lectures quite boring because all that he does is just recites his lecture notes and apart from that doesnt give any other examples. ,UCI,df33cx7,2,t5_2r7xu

Then after a certain date all the courses major restrictions gets lifted so any major can take ICS  if there are available spots left. This is one of the reasons why ICS  is so competitive because not only is it a GE so nonICS majors want to take it without intending to major in ICS its also the gateway course to get into ICS major. But there are no restrictions on it during the summer so no need to wait for an openenrollment period so should be less competitive.,UCI,dguxplq,1,t5_2r7xu
