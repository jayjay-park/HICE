11604640,0,t1_dgbe3lb,If you know what its supposed to be and it looks accurate to you then who cares? Also I see one spot that the line work looks kinda shaky to me. Other than that its pretty solid. Could do with a bit less darkness but...Honestly the only semi bad thing about this tattoo is that its difficult to tell what it is. Despite that though it still looks beautiful and adds to her body in a positive way. It also matches the rest of her body in a nice flowing way. You sound like a really judgemental person. ,TattooGirls,dgbe8zw,1,t5_3ggmh
