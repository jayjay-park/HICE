552278,0,t1_cg2nz74,Agreed. Any notion that people who spend money should be immune to consequences is ludicrous.Just because there happen to be both paying and nonpaying players in this game doesnt mean that the rules suddenly start working differently for the two groups. If this were a subscription game it would be clear to everybody except the exploiters most likely that the ToS still applies no matter how much money youve spent. This is no different. The fact that some players havent spent any money doesnt put me above them in any way. It just means that Im playing the game differently.What some of the other paying players forget is that FreetoPlay games dont just need paying players they need all players. All the paying players would evaporate without the full community of players around them.

1634331,0,t3_2d1lj8,Just in case something happens to the post on the main forums here is the main part of the post.   So I did just that I went and tested vorpalWith the changes in feats etc I decided the important thing would be comparing the percentage increase in average damage with and without vorpal and the percentage increase of the biggest crit between the live server and preview. So I did  tests. Each test consisted of  attacks by sure strike with my GWF two tests on live and two tests on preview one with no weapon enchantment and one with a perfect vorpal slotted. All other gear would stay the same.live no vorpalsure strike average . max  crit live vorpalsure strike average . max  crit preview no vorpalsure strike average . max  crit preview vorpalsure strike average . max  crit Now the sample size isnt huge statistically it should be bigger but quite honestly I didnt want to spend the time. So we will get some variation from rng in the hits and the amount of crits we had in each test. This means the numbers dont come out exactly even. So with that said lets look at the percentages.Live had an  increase in average damage preview had a  increase in average damage. With the variance in how much I actually crit and rng that  difference is statistically irrelevant imo. The damage increase was the same.For a comparison of max hit to max hit we see that live had a  increase and preview had a  increase. Once again because of rng the  difference is irrelevant.I hope this puts to rest rumors of vorpal nerfs as they just arent happening from what I can see.,Neverwinter,cjl67tb,0,t5_2sn0p

1699732,0,t1_cjskslj,Right.  All the neat stuff is either from a limited time event or in the zen shop.  Their pricing tiers are all messed up too.What they should do is take ALL of those limited time companions from events stuff them into a rotating store and sell them for a comparatively low amount of AD.  So like a blue companion would cost  instead of the  theyre trying to charge for the single blue companion they have for sale w AD.  Purple ones would cost like .  This would spur the economy to get people to buy AD since they would have a greater perceived value for their money.  As it stands now there is no reason to sell your zen in the game ever.  Thus the  USD backlog of people trying to buy zen.  I wont get into the other poor economic choices theyve made.  Their model will fold by Q of next year for Neverwinter though.  I know theyll have the ability to recover but I just dont think theyll have the wherewithal to stop shooting themselves in the foot.But they could bring their ARPU up and increase their userbase by  just by revamping their pricing model and rejiggering their lockbox system and companion system and this would also allow them to run through all of their lockboxes again before needing to devote more resources to developing more.  Not worth talking about it because they will never do it though.,Neverwinter,cjtewx2,1,t5_2sn0p

2160036,0,t1_cledw0v,Well personally Id say PvP in this game just isnt very good no matter your level. But there are plenty of people with nonperfect equipment doing PvP. I think k seems to be average. The thing is that there is no matchmaking so you might play one match against a pre made group with k GS each and the next against people with green equipment and k GS. So in many matches one group is obviously outmatched and they just sit on their campfire waiting for the match to end. If youre looking for PvP I find IWD to be more interesting. You can use the free world PvP to just form groups and have your own PvP matches.,Neverwinter,clee211,1,t5_2sn0p

It still has a couple of perks in that its one of the enchants that deals the most damage outright but its based on weapon damage which is low for GFs and the golden glow is very pretty. It is entirely possible that enchants will be reworked in the future as we know this is on the devs would really like to do list and that might reduce some of the longer internal cooldowns that make some enchants so much less viable than others.,Neverwinter,cnhk6m2,1,t5_2sn0p

2931446,0,t3_2to8a2,Heh!  GFs of the world.  Unite!... or Unite with other Classes!! Woot.You mentioned dragons and I like to use them as a guide for when Im doing my job well.  In some of the other comments supporting GFs DPS players point out that MovingDodging reduces their DPS.  Our ability to keep them from having to move is a key reason why we have a value even if we are not necessary.  So I figure Im in my glory when Im basking in dragon breath rather than hopping out of it.  At that point everybody else is just slashing away under the wings or attacking from a safe distance.  To make the most of it I utilize Steel Defense and kick Supremacy of Steel  just when the red lines appear and I throw up my block.  Yes I get pushed back but I can laugh at the dragon as he gets a taste of his own stink while Im immune to it.  In addition to Into the Fray I slot the encounters that get me back within easy reach for Cleave and Tide of Iron... so Lunging Strike and Bull Charge which doesnt knockback a dragon natch... cause I am happier when people dont use knockbacks... you dont use knockbacks do you??  DO YOU??  .  Like many people I would like Cryptic to offer us profiles that swapped gear and powers quickly cause Id admit that those are not optimal for many other encounter types and changing out is a bit of a drag.For most other PVe runs with teams I swap out Bull Charge for Enforced Threat.  And I put in Villains Menace as my damage doing daily preferring its AoE and control resistance to Indomitable Strength because there are few Single Targets that I cant outlast... to that end I have Fighters Recovery ready as a Plan B.When Im soloing I often swap Anvil of Doom in for Into the Fray.  I like its finishing power.  ,Neverwinter,co1bfar,3,t5_2sn0p

3534328,0,t1_cpuk4jg,Note that an hour is about  odds with a very very powerful party babysitting you through a dungeon. About a week is more realistic if you can consistently find dungeon parties. Thats T gear which renders you quite prepared for most endgame content. This will be obsolete soon and impossible to getBI is  days minimum of dailies PVP Profound soon to be replaced is around  days if you get about k glory a day k from dailies k from winning  matchesDraconic Templar is around a month if you win half your Tiamats and do day. Its a pain and will be obsolete soon as well.For mod  it looks like getting endgame gear will be about a month for PvP or PvE sets. There is some basic gear thats sufficient for dungeon running thats fairly cheap. On artifacts and artifact gear Its not a matter of how long its a matter of how much money you have or are willing to spend. Not necessarily real money mind but maxing out artifacts on a single character will run you some  million AD minimum come next module. Enchantments is similar. This is the equivalent of  for either  for both. Completely unnecessary for PvP or PvE but being completely maxed seems to be some peoples goal.

I believe as soon as you unlock those and are k gs Well of Dragons should open up for you. There you can do Dragon Heralds every  of the hour.To level up Leadership you should just focus on the training missions. Or you can make Mercs and make them into Footmen. Could be a good side business. On PC Footmen sell for k each. You could probably get much more on XBox.

3619594,0,t3_31rrgi,gtNow about the fact that you get the Oathbound Paladin so far ahead of us... cracks knucklesIts one aspect of this game that will hold it back long term IMHO.The console market with shared platform game releases has already shown that creating too large a gap between PC and Console versions is not good for the game.Diablo  is a classic example.  Its almost in line with the PC version only a month or so seperate them at most on patching and content.  Thats perfect IMHO.  Enough time to quickly iron out launch issues on PC where patching is easier not so much time that console gamers feel like theyre getting short changed on content delivery.ESO will launch in June being the biggest rival in the Xbox MMO market to Neverwinter this year and it will launch with the current PC version of the game in terms of content enough that PC players can import their characters directly to the Xbox version day one.If they dont think this will drag players away from Neverwinter if theyre still waiting for PC content theyre deluding themselves.Today Neverwinter has fairly limited end game content on X and questions are already being asked.If X gamers have to wait  months to a year for the same content as PC gets its game over for this MMO even if it is free to play.ESO will take over and have the kicker of not having a game so focused on the ZEN market.Neverwinter X didnt do anything for the seasonal event just past either.Its literally bare bones right now and that has to change.  ESO launches on X in  weeks from now.Now X gamers have found MMO legs comparisons will naturally be drawn and ESO will drag players away VERY quickly if they dont pull their finger out on X content.Im very glad Neverwinter is here on X dont get me wrong.  its my main game on X now.But long term... Im going to want far more content and I dont want to be waiting  months behind the PC crowd to get it.Blizzard nailed it with Diablo  hence its great success.  Neverwinter needs to take a leaf out of their book and get a wriggle on... the competition is almost here and its big mean and ugly!,Neverwinter,cq4uzc3,2,t5_2sn0p

3631508,0,t1_cq67jq2,First of all if I came across as snarky I apologize because I certainly didnt mean to.That said guild is just a word commonly used in fantasy MMOs to describe a longterm grouping of players with similar interests.  Nothing more than that.  That group of buddies you hang out with on the weekends in real life is a guild in this context.  Star Trek Online for example calls them Fleets but its still the same thing.  Different word same thing.That said again it only stands to reason that games of a completely different genre would use the same word for completely different things.  Assassins Creed and Call of Duty both have firearms but theyre completely wildly different after all.Thinking on it though are they really different?  Guilds in single player RPGs are a group of people with similar interests who get together to talk about the thing they like doing and sometimes do that thing together taking the high road on the obvious joke here.  Guilds in MMOs are a group of people with similar interests who get together to talk about the thing they like doing and sometimes do that thing together.  It only stands to reason that these people wouldnt be other players in a single player RPG.  Kind of implied that is.,Neverwinter,cq67xmd,1,t5_2sn0p

3695158,0,t3_32pvze,Recently theres been an influx of guild bank thieveries. If you become the victim of such a person and activity please contact Support immediately and report the handle of the violator there. Do not post about such activities or name such people as doing so is not allowed to protect users from false accusations by unscrupulous people for the forum staff has no way to prove or disprove such claims.Below are some helpful tips by one of your fellow posters katamaster and beckylunatic. Thanks kata!. When a person PMs you asking for an invite to guild look them up in the Find Person menu. If their current location is the Manycoins Bank in Protectors Enclave they are probably a guild bank thief. Not certainly but it is a pretty accurate indicator. If the person is unable to be found in the Find Person tab you can either ask them to change their privacy settings for a minute or friend them and look at their location that way. If they are located at the Bank ask them why they are standing at the bank. Most of the scammers simply give up at that point while interested individuals will most likely send you a confused reply.. One more thing about suspicious locations Hall of Justice is also an indicator. This is what shows up if a wouldbe thief is at the auxiliary guild bank location near Knox. It is also conveniently close to a mailbox for stashing illgotten goods and collecting funds from the sale thereof.. If an individual PMs you claiming they are an old guild leader or officer on a new account and asks for a promotion to rank  this is almost always a definite indicator of a scammer. The easiest way to test if they are lying is to tell them that they have to go onto their other account and promote themselves. If they are unable to do that then they are a scammer and simply want unrestricted access to your banks.. I also recommend that you check your Guild Bank restrictions and make sure Rank  members do not have access to anything of any value whatsoever.. Keep in mind that guild leadersofficers may not be the only people who can invite to a guild depending on the permissions set in the permissions tab. If this is the case I suggest you send out a link to this post in a Guild Mail with a brief explanation to your members of what you are linking them and why. The more often you do this the better off you and your guild are. Another way to spread the word is to link to this post in the guild MoTD. Everyone sees it and your guilds valuables are even safer.. Alright say the worst case scenario happens  Someone gets into the guild bank sees you have some valuable stuff and gets away with some of it before they are kicked. If they saw you have expensive stuff in your guild bank you can be sure they will try and get back in to take the rest of it. Whenever this happens you should send out a guild mail explain what happened tell your guild members the handle of the thief and warn them not to invite that individual. You can also put this in your guild MoTD.. You should always screenshot any conversations you have with a guild bank thief along with the guild bank logs and member logs showing the date they joined and quit along with what they took. These screenshots will not only serve as evidence that they are guilty when showing other players but can also be used as proof against the guild bank thieves for when you contact support. An easy way to take a screenshot is the chat command screenshotuijpg. Please do not post such evidence on the forum. You should save such to be sent to Support through the Support Site or by email correspondence. If you need help with taking and finding screenshots please look for info or ask on our forum.,Neverwinter,cqdh0w0,5,t5_2sn0p

Still their defenses are lacking compared to Combat HR so if you manage to get the jump on them with a nice Boar Charge opener following by Fox Shift theyre in some serious trouble. From there you can decide if you want to lawnmower their face with your melee AA. Or you can switch stances Marauders Escape buff with ranged version of Fox and Boar Disruptive Shot Marauders Rush go HAM and wait for Boar and Fox cooldowns or possibly Disuprtive again. This is what I do at least and it rekks a lot of people. EDIT Also if you have the AP for Disruptive sometime its better to Boar Charge Disruptive Fox Shift AA Marauders Rush. Thats some good chain CC that forces them to eat the Fox Shift and some beefed up AAs from the Combat tree. ,Neverwinter,cqiuigi,1,t5_2sn0p

I go  kills with  or fewer deaths in PvP and out DPS everyone in PvE with  mil damage dealt while the next guy had mil. Go executioner with your paragon the Shadow of Demise is the most broken deadly thing Ive ever seen. My encounters in PvP are Dazing Strike X Lashing Blade B Deft Strike Y but if youre getting ccd left and right I would switch Y for Impossible to Catch. The executioner tree should make it to where you can go stealth every  or so seconds so you will mostly be stealth attacking everything for kk damage and if that doesnt  hit them then Shadow of Demise will in a couple of seconds. Dailys are Whirlwind of Blades if theres multiple people around you and the last Daily you unlock called Thunder something Im not home so cant remember name but it does crazy single target damage that ignores armor which is great against Tanks and Healers. I use Sly flourish and Cold Steel atwills. The only change for PvE is Y which I use Smoke Bomb instead of Deft Strike and ITC the PvE DPS with smoke bomb is just dumb and ticks for at least k damage to everything around you for  seconds while also dazing them.,Neverwinter,cqy519e,2,t5_2sn0p

They have much better stats but the whole point of the new artifacts was to devalue the old ones rather than give us something better. For it to be better thered need to be content to actually make it more effective in but they rebalanced everything and removed some of the old content in a way that kind of makes the rerelease kind of insulting considering artifact equipment was promised to be a long term thing that you kept with you.

4016304,0,t1_crdznzb,Im sorry but earning a  RoI by taking advantage of a new players niavety is a scam. A new player can earn k AD in less than a day by doing dailies. A new player will likely take a week or more to earn  gold. Players that participate in this sort of trading are scammers pure and simple because they are taking advantage of a new players trust that the deal is fair when its clearly not. Which is the very definition of a scam.In regards to AH having inflated prices I also beg to differ. If anything items are WAY too cheap.  It costs roughly  million AD to make a perfect vorpal from scratch and yet they are listed on the AH for around  million AD... the same holds true for just about every enchantment. The only exception to this is the rarer items are a bit overpriced such as draconic helms and chest armor but that is simply because the supply there is low and the demand is high.,Neverwinter,cre37u7,0,t5_2sn0p

4176090,0,t3_38lbgh,The concept of a QampA session does sound appealing though I am pretty sure that he will more than likely be bombarded with an onslaught of the same questions worded a thousand different ways which would ultimately end up defeating the concept.Outside of the pleathora of TR balancing TR Shadow of Demise TR stunop Vote Kicking etc... there is little more than I think he could offer I wouldnt think he would be allowed to provides actual dates for future content xbox nor be able to discuss in detail about mod . All the previous stuff mentioned the information is already availible if people look for it or all he may possibly be able to say is the dev team are aware and working on a reseloution.Community Managers tend to need skin harder than dragon scales because these AMA are the equivilant of feeding them to a pack of dire wolves. Which I would feel slightly guilty for wouldnt lose sleep over it mind you. Plus there is the notion that is would just be lost on the forums within the week and thus the same questions would just be recycled.Perhaps instead of a solitary AMA session how about a weekly question? It could be a weekley sticky perhaps where people then pose a question and at the end of the week the one with the highest upvotes he could grace with an answer? This way it could create a sense that there are good lines of communication because in response to that question with the most upvotes he could even have a little insert from a dev member?One week should allow for sufficient time to gain that sort of information whilst not harrasing the dev team constantly. Plus it keeps it going and becomes a regular source of info and know that I think about it perhaps two questions a week one for each platform as I am sure there will be vastly different things to discuss.If there is to be an AMA session perhaps this would be my question to him does this sound like an ideal scenario to test out?,Neverwinter,crwa3gh,4,t5_2sn0p

The exploits in beta and later near mod did have impact on the economy and changed things quite a bit but its not like average players have hundredhts of mils sitting arround filling backlog. Reason why backlog is there is simply because in PC so much AD enters the economy that inflation is inevitable.

4231222,0,t1_cs2g8lw,Im sure.  Like many of this games tooltips it is both misleading and ambiguous.  In PvP the tooltip is slightly more accurate.  In PvE the HV set works as I described as a damage multiplier debuff  defense boost.  Read the debuff section from the link that I posted above.  Also see the link below for exactly which powers apply which types of stacks it is not consistent on which powers apply the damage multiplier debuff versus give you the defense boostAll of that info is consistent with my own testing  monitoring the numbers in the combat log watching my own stats for the defense boost and monitoring the buff icons on myself and the debuff icons on the enemies.  You can see the little  for  stacks on the HV debuff icon on an enemy when you have all of the stacks on it.Also when you mention that you beat another CW what spec are you and what spec where they?  Both Renegade and MoF have big buffs to group DPS while SS Thaum is all personal DPS.  Im SS Renegade with HV set and Im often slightly lower on Paingiver compared to equally geared and well speced DPS players as Im buffing their damage a lot.  I imagine MoF CW and buffingDPS Clerics are in the same situation.  Paingiver can be a very misleading metric  e.g. you dont get credit for buffs.,Neverwinter,cs2jlq7,1,t5_2sn0p

4463679,0,t1_cst8nf6,Firstly xbox player. I have the PC version and played it up until the release of the Xbox version so I havent played mod  and I didnt want to give it a try really with how many complaints I saw about it. If i understand what youre saying correctly the new artifact offhand and main hand dont require the previous version? I was under the initial impression you had to get the old artifacts out of the ToD campaign before you could upgrade them to the new ones. The reason I ask is because Im currently in the process of upgrading my current old for PC version artifact mainhand and belt and offhand when Tiamat shows up in a few days both are purple headed towards orange but if they dont have to be orange in order to obtain the new ones Id assume a wiser course of action would be to bank ALL of my RP until mod  hits xbox then.,Neverwinter,cstbplo,1,t5_2sn0p

I went over the section that talks about IP section  involving user content. They are speaking of course about user content published to a website that infringes copyright law AKA using their character models to draw porn and posting it to your website and charging people to pay to see it. They are not speaking about support records nor do they say a word about support conversations in section  because section  is written about intellectual property of which support conversations are not correspondence is not copyrighted material.

4516850,0,t3_3cxi9s,Well being level  you should just not worry at all about best in slot and shit like that youll be out leveling gear so fast just take what the game gives you off of trash mobs and use that. As far as PvP only it doesnt really make too much sense to flat out refuse to do anything other than PvP as Im sure youll want to take breaks from PvP every once in a while. Just get rank  Azures in all your offense slots and Silvers in all your utility slots. Defense slots can be pretty much anything other than Dark although I suggest Radiant or Draconic. Throw  into the game and turn the zen into Astral Diamonds get yourself a dragon bone weapon and offhand then buy yourself a lesser plague fire enchantment or if you want to spend more money you can get a regular vorpal enchantment lesser plague fire gt lesser vorpal normal plague fire lt normal vorpal in my opinion. As for classes Hunter Ranger is great once you get to your trapper feats. Trickster Rogue is easily the best low level PvPer and still really strong at  but be prepared to be called broken and get teabagged every time you die. Devoted Cleric can be damnnear invincible with the right build or it can be a damage dealing glass cannon. Control Wizard can basically kill anyone v without taking damage due to pushing choking stunning etc. Scourge Warlock is pretty weak right now Great Weapon Fighter is too. Guardian Fighter can make an interesting PvP class you can either be super hard to kill or do decent damage and still be relatively hard to kill.Green and blue gear dont matter much youll be going through them fast. If you dont want to do anything but PvP youll have to throw a few bucks into Zen turn it into Astral Diamonds and buy stuff off the auction house every  levels but I suggest just going to places that are your level at the time and killing random monsters in the area you wont get much XP and youll get some decent gear.,Neverwinter,cszzrbr,1,t5_2sn0p

As for Astral sealshield I ran seal all yesterday and had only one Tiamat lag badly but at the same time i saw several people yesterday dropping shield with no issues. I never run shield myself.

Yes you can blame it one people not knowing how to do it but at the end of the day you need dps to get the heads down and dps comes with well built AND well geared characters. This doesnt apply as much to clerics but it does to every other class tanks need to be well geared to pull threat at a decent level without being killed.If I see a lobby full of k gs  and lower players Ill leave now as I know we have very little chance of completing it. Just this previous run I got in tow lobby like this with  other k guildies dont blame us for boot and loot as usually only run as a full group and us four were taking down adjacent heads faster than the rest of the lobby could take one down.

It made sense to me. Eventually I switched to high prophet and besides being a tiny bit more squishy I couldnt tell the difference without the  piece bonus of either set. I diehard ran high prophet since then. Currently Im running Draconic Templar for the flat debuff aura and wanting to switch it up. I find it silly easy for pugs throughout all current content and I feel ridiculously tanky even as a DO cleric. If youre not going for High Prophet which I still keep ready to go in my bags for nonpugging groups Id actually recommend Draconic Templar.

In mod there are four tiers of feat leading up to them so you need to spend  points in the tree before you can buy the capstone.  In mod there are five tiers so you have to spend  points in the tree before you can buy the capstone.  You have to be higher level before the capstone becomes available at all.  Mod builds are illegal in mod ie. there is simply no way to produce them.Sorry if this is already obvious to everyone but I worried when the previous person discussed the respec only costing k AD.  Remember console players dont have Gateway or Sword Cost Adventures or the ability to fire up the client from a laptop at work to keep Leadership flowing.

5089773,0,t1_cuzbxw5,I mostly have seen people trying to trade gold for coals and gmops that doesnt mean anyone is buying. Personally I havent needed gold since level  there simply arent enough things on which to spend gold for it to be of any real use to me. Since the official currency has no real use in the game people use rare commodities that do have ingame uses as substitute currencies. This is a very common practice in MMOs going back at least  years. Its most commonly used in mature games when the official currency has been devalued by inflation but its also seen in younger games where the official currency has been devalued due to lack of anything worth buying. This is particularly true of Neverwinter where theres already an alternative currency in the form of Astral Diamonds.Incidentally its also a common practice in real world closed economies like prisons or countries with serious fiscal problems. If the official currency is worthless e.g. due to inflation or artificially restricted people will turn to commodities. But since many people have an inherent distrust of straight barter it is not uncommon for them to agree to use something like cigarettes or cows as a standard.And yes there is the very big risk that the developers may make some seemingly innocuous change to the game that massively devalues these substitute currencies.,Neverwinter,cuziddj,0,t5_2sn0p

5239260,0,t1_cvguydi,Im not sure what youre saying here.. But yes set some goals. I would tell myself to AT least get a level a day. After you finish your mandatory vigilance quests for the artifact ONLY pick up the quests in the same area. I know for a fact during one quest hour there are  quests to where you only have to kill the Howling Hatred enemies. Just go slaughter them while watching tv I mean you barely have to give the game any attention while farming XP.. I say the best quests to pick up at Spinward Rise is Lesser Aura Toms where you fly. Anything that has to do with killing the howling hatred. Anything where you kill Slaads Air Archons and Kenku.. All easy ass quests. Theyre repetitive as fuck yes. But that will work. Also rank s in your utility and VIP rank  helps a lot. ,Neverwinter,cvhird0,1,t5_2sn0p

However before you do that you need to get you blue alliance gear from Ts. Lostmouth is a pretty easy dungeon to do this in.  If you are PvE you will need the lostmouth set if you want to keep up with others in DPS. Since you are following ironzergs build focus on high critical chance and combat advantage. Those stats will help you the most.  Choose artifacts that give stats that harder to get from gear.. Combat advantage life steal armor pen etc.  You are kinda asking for a lot of info so its hard to help on here.... Sorry. ,Neverwinter,cvj3zce,1,t5_2sn0p

5380500,0,t3_3olfq4,Its shit like this though that leaves me shaking my head. How are the Developers going to strip most of the AD out of the game and then not adjust the prices of things in game to reflect the current economy? For instance the cost of upgrading a companion cost of gear from vendors rareblue gear cost of cubes in the bazaar.. Companions are the biggest problem. It would be so much better if you could cheaply upgrade all companions to Epic to make them a bigger part of the game. Already the majority of Epic companions on the AH are cheaper than upgrading a rare to Epic. Under k upgrading a Uncommon to a rare is k and if you look at any other aspect of the game then upgrading any uncommon gear or Artifact to rare does not cost anywhere in the ball park of k in refinement materials. How did they come up with these prices? ,Neverwinter,cvzf40h,1,t5_2sn0p

Im at level  and using your build but without stacking armor penetration I cant damage a thing. Im curious about your stat and how you balance party and solo play. I see the value in the Radiants when acting strictly in a support role but I cringe when I think about grinding out my dailies at  without a certain level of ARP.I guess I have one other question. Im using Forgemasters Flame as I level and cast it at  stacks of empowered. Often it allows me to quickly spam it after the rd cast and Im able to rapid fire several more strikes. At those moments it ends with a bolt striking me and leaving a mark where I stand. Whats firing in those moments?  When it happens its like having a machine gun and I wreck mobs compared to most other times.,Neverwinter,cyw524j,1,t5_2sn0p
6220747,0,t3_40sam0,best advice i can give is to grind. start with the drowned shores over and over to get to . at  get your blue  gear buy some cheap off ah. run lostmauth shores alot. get alliance gear. run ts during double seals or minium once a day for a cache. get elven gear. then farm shores or lostmauth until youre at the point that you want to quit the game. at this time itll be double astral diamomds so all the farming you did will make you rich! salvage all the gear from the grind... you did save it all right RIGHT?!. but you can only salvage k a day how will that make you rich you ask? transfer salvage to the alts to make them salvage too. each alt you give rings necks etc. can earn k a day too! hope i helped. good luck!,Neverwinter,cywqcly,1,t5_2sn0p

The  should be the same.Step  apply  stacks of the high prophet debuff to some monster then have the same person hit it. You will notice the  number is  larger then the other.

Always x XP for current level  necks and belts could compensate for needed refinement points similar to how artifact main hands and off hands are treated.

I think that now the trick for us to get DPS is to have the Owlbear companion and then just stack the shit out of power getting crit as low as humanly possible.  In theory this would work because the Owlbear cub gives  power attack on missed crit.Im going to play with that when I have enough money for a respec.

7517817,0,t1_d2wc8p8,I am not talking about AS that is a whole different story that makes them immortal. Im talking about the new era of DCs that dont depend on AS but are more hybrid with high deflect  defense  life steal. These in particular also use forgehammer and can dish out quite a bit damage because of really heavy dot ticks. At this point it becomes who dies st. What happens in this case is you are hitting them for nothing and most hits are  damage. So if you happen to trigger life steal guess you get  life back. And so the only way you can do damage to them is if you succeed in knocking them prone and at that point they do take some hits. As a GWF this isnt something you can easily pull off like a GF can and can easily be avoided with a dodge in which case they have  dodges. Most experienced players know when you are about to do a heavy hit and can easily avoid you and kite you like in the case of close range targets with the exception of TRs. My point is that DC can be exceptionally tanky can heal can heal to max every  sec if falls below certain health threshold and can dodge and do considerable damage to opponent. Not to mention some use terror enchant that is still broken and procs each time they deflect which basically stuns you.

You get up to  temporary life from two of your encounter powers and a slightly temporary life boost from a daily power.  With a paladin you can almost tank mistral point something a guardian fighter cant do.  The only problem is lack of dps there are ways to boost it but a protection paladin is like the incredible hulk the more you get damaged the higher your damage.  Guardian fighters have huge damage boost for the party and damage debuff.  The paladin has something similar its called bane it does both damage buff and debuff but has to be constantly be applied to be useful.  Both can build threat the paladin has an encounter where the more you hit the marked target the more threat is built for the paladin.

8162058,0,t3_4r2m29,The whole problem with AD is that by the time you figure it out you dont need it as much.  That being said the earliest and easiest way is to run dungeons and salvage the gear.   Try and maintain the k per day and any overages put on your alts.  That said grind and grind elol shores etc. if youre lucky youll come up with an artifact if not youll at least have salvage.  Once you get a little AD start watching the AH the buy low sell high thing especially around X rp events you can make a nice profit.  You can grind areas and sell RP there are a million ways to do it but there is no instant gratification it takes a while.     edit     One thing I forget to mention start making keys to open greater demonic chests asap!

However you can choose to earn it through the ingame currency entirely making it free while also keeping in mind that occasionally coupons can be acquired in game for  off certain items from the zen store. Also that  price tag is a bit hefty for a mount but you should also bear in mind that any mounts purchased through the zen store are account wide meaning that you can have one on each of your character but only have to buy it once side note the same generally does NOT hold true for companions purchased from the zen shop unless that companion is part of a larger package such as the Champion of the North pack which I believe gives an account wide panther companion.,Neverwinter,d4yz831,2,t5_2sn0p

Did no one suspect this was going to be an issue when it was implemented this way? Then go out and sell mounts with huge stat increases and wonder why the bosses are melting and the game is no longer challenging for many groups? Rather than think this through from the start the solution is to sell items wait for the game to get completely out of whack and then take away things that players have spent money and countless hours to build.  Why would I spend any more money on this game when its clear they have no forward thinking and have no issue changing things on a dime in ways that will render my money and time spent pointless?

Basically though my point was that while I know that we will be able to adapt to this its going to be very expensive and annoying because we have to get all new companions equipment and etc.  If the nerf would have done something like ITF now buffs damage by  of your damage resistance it would have been less of an issue.  But now all of the extra defense we have is no good anymore.  I already know what Im planning to do with my GF and it will be very useful.  But it will be very expensive for me to get things changed around.  Usually when something gets nerfed its just a matter of changing powers feats rotation or something similar but for many GFs it will mean a reworking of a lot of things while probably still using the same power rotation.  Thats what has a lot of us annoyed.,Neverwinter,d5crnhn,1,t5_2sn0p

I actually have my second free bag devoted to bound items on my DC and probably the rd bag worth on my TR as you cannot get them back once you toss them. Anything distinctive I keep.As for salvage the quest details what criteria items need to be for you to use it.

9276604,0,t1_d8r10qh,From what I remember from the Trans version of the enchantment. The Resistance aspect works the same way Negation does. It caps out at  more resistance then that of a Trans Negation. The problem wasis that soon as you deflect an attack you lose all your stacks. The Deflection aspect is based off your deflect rating and not the chance to deflect. This means that as long as you dont dump points into deflection through Silvery ench or Gear you will be looking at less than  deflect chance per stack. This will keep the Resistance stacks up forever basically until you actually deflect something. Negation stacks drop off if youre not getting hit. So in that sense Shadowclad is better for stacking resistance. My personal opinion if youre looking for a tanky build and youve already capped your DR dump everything else into HP and not deflection. Then run either Trans Shadow or Trans Negation. I prefer Negation because of the  incoming healing and  Recovery. Shadowclad is great if you want to max out your Resistance without it every dropping off as long as you never deflect an attack. Its probably better on a ranged class because theres the stealth feature in case you do deflect an attack you can avoid threat for a few seconds. Maybe on a SW or a CW it would be better. Sorry Im going off topic. ,Neverwinter,d8rvjlu,1,t5_2sn0p

9481708,0,t1_d9hqqrt,Check out my power stacking post  It answers some of your questions through testing I have already done.  Basically the good news is ITC can boost your power by something on the neighborhood of K power.  Bad news is it goes away in  seconds.  Takes  seconds to come back so you are getting a  buff on power with a  uptime.  You can do more if you swap it out for another power like blade flurry lashing blade or wicked reminder especially if you are running an easy dungeon with premades.  But against pure mobs the rotation I use with the extra about  damage for  seconds from ITC is usually enough to kill them all.  In more challenging areas ITC helps with survival while providing a good buff not to mention helping to continue your rotation if a boss is about to hit you.  Hope this helps!,Neverwinter,d9htpqd,1,t5_2sn0p

Its three defense slots mean you can run all hp enchants on your self and use assassins covanent and still hit  Dr using three stat enchants on your companion. Lastly it doesnt taunt like other leaderdefender companions so wont turn dungeon bosses on your squishy dps.

This is when you make some your biggest iLvl gains upgrading artifacts and artifact gear.  Reinforcements You can apply reinforcements to your armor and jewelry.  iLvl for each of the maxed versions Power ArmPen Recovery etc for your armor and Action Points Stamina etc for your jewelry. With  armor and  jewelry you can get up a total of  additional iLvl with maxed lvl reinforcements. Note if you upgrade your armor to elemental through Black Ice shaping you will loose the armor reinforcements.  Grind for  or   Underdark rings as they have  enchant slots. Or get your jewelcrafting to  and make dual enchant slot rings. Upgrade your enchantment levelsBoons and Bonding Runestones for summoned companions have just as much impact on your performance as increasing you item level.

Other classes will most certainly have different results. Particulary the TR HR and GWF if Im not mistaken. So speaking to the angle of a TR you may indeed experience more than  a  increase I cant say for certain. The absolute easiest way I would figure you could get a ballpark figure for the increase would be to jot down a few of the tooltip damage displays of your powers while wearing the relic weapons and then swap over to maxed out variants of the old weapons jot those numbers down and divide the two. It wont be entirely accurate because tooltips also factor in your Power which will be different between the two weapon sets but it should get you in the ballpark.,Neverwinter,ddaz071,2,t5_2sn0p

My rotation is ConstrictinggtCordongtHinderinggtCareful Attack Stacks of melee AotS damage after switching stancesgt Plant GrowthgtHindering StrikegtSteel BreezegtSeismic Shot  stacks of ranged AotSgtRepeatKeep in mind that during boss fights you may have some cooldowns.For passives I use Aspect of the Falcon and Aspect of the Serpent. My play style is similar to Sumes Longstrider but I dont use Longstriders. Getting the fixed DoT from Thorned Roots at a distance is big from AotF up  bonus damage iirc. Your feats are a little weird Ive gone full trapper too but maxed different feats. Ill edit as I go since Im on mobile.The  consumption for slashers mark is not really needed we get our daily back very quickly. Same goes for the  Ap gain when switching stances it doesnt work the way you may think it does. Say for example you have  ap gain already its not additive. Youre not going to recieve  on top of that youll be getting  as its  of that . Maxed out Ancient Roots as it makes our main source of damage Thorned Roots last longer.Another big thing is learning how to skill hop its harder for us on console to achieve and it can get your hands tired if you play too much. To skill hop you have to be jumping around while also using your encounters. You must always be in position for combat advantage if not youre losing around  bonus damage.  itself  underdark boon  Combat Adv Stat  Companions and  CharismaAotF can be switched out to AotP if youre facing a boss that moves around too much.

10658930,0,t3_5sfi4p,So I would go with being good at whichever you derive more pleasure in playing. I would rather run a dungeon with any of those classes that has someone who knows how to use them and enjoys it than any one of the others who doesnt. I have both a GF and HR. Now my GF is usually in more demand because folks are always looking for a tank. However my HR can pull an entire set of mobs into a tight little ball and hold them there while the tank pulls aggro and the GWF beats the crap out of all of them. I will usually pull second on many dungeons in DPS too A good deal behind a good GWF but still not miniscule. It is because I learned how to play them which i did cause I enjoy it.

So after you completed the empowered rotatation you still have a fee spells left to cast  before you start using your at wills again. Chains is really nice as damage and a.p. gain  I critical hit for k at times and divine glow will apply a buff debuff some healing the only heal I really use unless Im with pugs and applys what little haste we have left. Ive read all the builds literally all of them and most have the same idea. We build ap for ourself now instead of focusing on the group. Doing so allows us to cast a.a. quickly I pop my d.c. sigil and cast hollowed ground as well on top of a debuff rotation with a strong group bosses can die in  rotation. It happens with the right crew and its glorious. Sorry for typos on my way to work on mobile.

It used to be lower.. say ... but its moved a bit.. to like .. But by .k.. you should have around  of those stats anyways.. the last few thousand stats cost the most. The real difference isnt in I level but usually in companion costs. It nets a high advantage if you have your  legendary   epics built right.. including your r bondings and r enchants on your summoned pet. We are talking about up to  of your dps form companions.. with the majority of that from your bondings of course But the last  of peoples dps is usually from those other actives.

You will however probably find dungeons difficult to tank in with that build early on.  I was tact to start now Conq. I havent played the protector tree as I think Tact is better for party support and tanking and Conq. later on for dps and tanking.  Conq. is more difficult because youre giving up defensive boons for offensive so if you cant compensate for the difference with higher level enchantments it might be best to wait until you can.

11065857,0,t3_5xzysn,I dont play a CW but I guess it depends on who you run with. If your group DPS is strong then buffing multiple people could yield nore group damage than your solo damage. But depending on their crit etc they might not take full advantage of all of your buffs. I dont really know what you buff.Versly if you run with subpar group dps then maybe uppibg your personal dps could have a bigger return.I think its a personal thing. Does your increase in personal dps outweigh the damage youre going to provide the group. Paingiver forces a lot of people to go solo dps and forget about the group dynamic. Id rather respec and have my group shave off  minutes in a run then doing a few million more personal damage. Id say test it. If you run with the same group then do a few runs with your curreny spec. Then respec and take a look at the run time and time to kill. Base your decision off of that. The answer will be different for everyone no?,Neverwinter,demayw6,0,t5_2sn0p

11208831,0,t1_df2ew5o,I mean Im not sure what path they are leading you on. My initial impression was based on your comment that AA is going down the sewer is that you were switching to DO rather then staying as AC. Regardless both seem like they will be solid paths to go down as we get more familiar with Mod  but neither should be emphasizing silvery over radiant.Ultimately I think its easier to read a few guides online both DO and AC andor just experiment as you play in order to get more familiar with the class before seeking too much advice. Nevertheless and for what its worth these are the stats goals I think you should ultimately as in long term thinking should try and reachACDC ltgt  base power  crit chance  recovery  ap gain  armor penDODC ltgt  base power  crit chance  recovery  ap gain  armor penOther then the power stat by base I essentially mean power that you can share with your party lt this would not include for example any power given to you from your companion all the other stats I listed would include your companions shared stats. Once you get rank  bonding stones the stats on your character sheets will jump up significantly. Some may disagree with those numbers I know many DCs REALLY dont agree you need such high recovery for example but those numbers would be my goals to reach before playing around too much elsewhere. The order you get to those may differ but if you do decide to stick with silverys for now then go for it. Once you get into that  range though you are going to want to start thinking about swapping some of those silvery for radiantbrutalcruelblack ice enchantments. Try and balance out your stats to hit those numbers above or perhaps as you get higher youll think im an idiot and create your own set of goal stats which is great!,Neverwinter,df2ib4u,1,t5_2sn0p

You would get to max level way before this though and most quests dont actually start until you hit max. a note about max level  it is one thing in an MMO to level uphit max level amp in Neverwinter thats the easy part  the next thing is to level all the other parts of your character e.g. equipment mounts enchantments powers companions etc... this is the part that takes months or years to do this rating in Neverwinter is called IL item level tutorials there are some in game tutorials but to really learn whats going on youtubeblogs etc are pretty much necessary readingviewing you can play without them but youll probably waste lots of ingame cashmake bad choices about which skills you choose etc boss fights the actual boss fights are mainly fairly fast a few minutes at most a lot of bosses come at the end ofpart way through instanced dungeons though. These as a whole can take  min to an hour or more. There are also other open air shared boss fights called Heroic encounters  these are pure boss fights that you can just jump into any time and usually take around  mins ish on average. is grinding challenging  overall you have some flexibility on which quests you do when and which you skip so you can stick to an easier path or jump to harder stuff earlier. There are exceptions e.g. if you want rewards that come from a certain quest and youre already too strong for it then itll be super easy pay to grindwin  there is no need to pay anything to play the main PVE part of the game Player vs Environment  questing dugeons etc. If you want to get powerful very fast or if you want certain convenience items then you can pay. If you want to win in PVP Player vs Player  an optional part of the game you will either need to pay lots of cash to get to a high Item Level or put in lots and lots of time to get your IL up the free way.  in general  if you want to just play a few hours a week just do that  dont focus on getting max anything just enjoy playing the bits youre doing and as you go along youll level stuff and more stuff will open for you. Also keep in mind that if you like it and stick with it you can probably play for years and still not max everything out. MMOs are generally more about enjoying the game amp community than winning.,Neverwinter,df7os9r,1,t5_2sn0p

11681166,0,t3_66oqc3,There are a number of reasons for alts.The first one is its fun. You can play something else for a change of pace style whatever.Second is access to the Sigil artifacts. I leave it as an exercise for the reader to decide which if any are useful to your class.Third is bag space. More bag space is good.Fourth is AD. Via invokes professions CT runs. And enough bag space for a bit of AH playing.Fifth is education. If you play multiple classes you will have a better understanding of what they are trying to achieve in group play.

11723192,0,t3_679sav,I also recently did a trip to Fallsview.  Im not a gambler at all!  I was there with friends celebrating an upcoming marriage not my marriage!.Walking through the floor after a few really expensive drinks I was looking at the different slot machines thinking to myself Lame Lame So Lame! and then OMFG!  WTF IS THIS?!!  It was the DampD slot machine!Seat was empty so I sat down and stared in awe at the screen.  Like you I had to just HAD to drop a few bucks into the machine.I wasnt having any luck with my spins but the screens were very entertaining and so many recognizable names!  I lost my first  pretty quickly.  My friends werent ready to cash out on their losing hands of Blackjack so I sat back down at the DampD slot and put in another .My final spin was a winner!  Not a big winner but enough to compel me into spinning more.  In goes another !Near the beginning of my next  my friends showed up and stood around me as I used up the rest of my spins.  This final  mustve been a very lucky  because I won.  And I won big!With myself and my friends hootin and hollerin like crazed frost giants we drew quite a crowd around the machine.  I decided that Id take my winnings and cash out.  As I walked towards the booth thing to cash out I turned around and looked at my friends and the other people that were following me including security! and had a feeling of being Epic.That Epic feeling mustve been the same feeling Drizzt and Bruenor felt every time they went out on an adventure.I secretly felt like a major nerd but I loved every second of it!,Neverwinter,dgour6v,8,t5_2sn0p

And you get dirty looks off people when they see Iron Vanguard its great xD     Also because no one has fulfilled your request and to be honest I dont think they will since every dungeon run is going to yield different percentages    I test my dps by    Spending some time with the training dummies in the Stronghold with bondings without bondings etc.      Look for the average numbers biggest number and smallest number so you have a dps range I.e. at wills unbuffed kk fully self buffed kk. Then if you play around you can gauge increases or decreases in at wills or IBS or whatever     We dont have anything as good as ACT but we do have a combat log on console you can scroll through. Do a full rotation On a dummy to Buff yourself and then do another one at full dps then stop unsummon your companion and scroll up through the log     You can also do a controlled dungeon test farm run multiple CNs or FBIs or MSVAs and clock your DPS at various points in the dungeons after each boss? Then run them after a respec with the same team doing exactly the same run to compare.   I like eToS for testing because of the natural stopping points in the dungeon my dps is always around the same in there no matter what.    ,Neverwinter,dgq4ebv,1,t5_2sn0p
