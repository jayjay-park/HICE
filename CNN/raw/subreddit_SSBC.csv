6429913,0,t3_42h6di,I am curious as well. If not an announcement of the specific date I would like to know if we might possibly see it in a few days weeks months or please no years. if I wont see the .. update for more then  or  months from now I would probably just cave and start playing the most recent update even if it means I have to edit my own controller support with software. but if we are due to see the update in the next few weeks I will happily wait for gamecube controller support with open arms.,SSBC,czke3br,3,t5_3ae25
