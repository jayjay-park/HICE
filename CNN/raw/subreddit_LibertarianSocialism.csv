1658993,0,t3_2db7mi,I guess my first question is why are you on ANY group on Facebook? Better yet still on Facebook at all. I left that years ago. Critics of capitalism big business globalization and  proenvironmentalists are targeted as terrorists these days. Granted dissidents to the status quo and the economy have always been the real targets of the security state anyway. Then again here I am subcribed and posting in this subreddit ranarchism and all the all rest...Fuck me.,LibertarianSocialism,cjoa1w9,1,t5_2qpfx
2115050,0,t1_cl8nsvd,Not a safe space?  LoL.  Safe from what?  Arguments with which you cannot contend?  Its the internet.  Havent you ever heard the phrase Sticks and stones can break my bones but words will never hurt me?  This is a lesson taught in kindergarten and typically mastered by five year olds.  I have read privilege and race theory.  And I agree with a lot of it.  There is a lot of statistical evidence for female privilege in America  As far as the race card I agree there are many underprivileged black people in America.  But what about Willow Smith?  Isnt she an overprivileged black female?  And there are probably underprivileged white males but they dont have media awareness or a PAC.  See this is the problem when you think of privilege in terms of groups rather than individuals.  Youve simply created another stereotypical bias.  Not all racial minorities are underprivileged and not all white males are overprivileged.  To think so is a form of prejudice in itself.  ,LibertarianSocialism,cl8o30p,-1,t5_2qpfx
2244933,0,t1_clp5rkm,Theres endless unused land in the  states.  And younger generations instead of being slaves to the older land owners should be free to claim land amp build homesetc.Basically actual homesteading is a fundamental part of liberty.  If youre not enslaved you can homestead.The problem is ancaps are Orwellian liars.  They dont want to homestead land for a home they want the few to claim practically all land.So that the poor have none at all.Aka slavery.  Their goal is  depriving the poor of land ownership so the poor must surrender part of their production to be allowed to live.Basically theyre libertarians for slavery.  ,LibertarianSocialism,clp6mh5,5,t5_2qpfx

9136918,0,t1_d8a17lx,TLDR friend?You must have not read my previous post I apologize if it wasnt to you liking I spent quite a while analyzing yours so i thought you would get to mine. For the last time Friedman is not talking about the socialism that I am talking about. His quote As I see it the fundamental value in relations among people is to respect the dignity and individuality of fellow man. To treat your fellow man not as an object to be manipulated for your purpose but to treat him as a person with his own values and his own rights. Capitalism does not have what Friedman describes if you truly want a voluntary society in which workers share their creations to the world and compete in a fair field dont support fatcats who give a rats ass about it. Support hardworkers who created the throne they sit on.,LibertarianSocialism,d8a65p8,2,t5_2qpfx

11027035,0,t3_5xbf2q,They might be interested in some communization theory. Maybe an issue of Endnotes or Gilles Dauvs Eclipse and Reemergence of the Communist Movement.Another good choice would be Inventing the Future Postcapitalism and a World Without Work by Nick Srnicek and Alex Williams.,LibertarianSocialism,dehw16g,2,t5_2qpfx
11259750,0,t3_60ocac,Private property vs central power? Whos to say which is worse? Its contextual. They usually work together. Etc.I feel like my problem with ML is the dogmatism that would ascribe a correct answer to these types of vague hypotheticals. Not to mention the worshiping of dead dudes.,LibertarianSocialism,df89xxr,4,t5_2qpfx
