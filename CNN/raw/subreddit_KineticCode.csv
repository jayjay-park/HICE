9861314,0,t1_dasboo4,The problem is that is fires so fast that recoil is a legitimate worry but with a gun like this low recoil  OP. High recoil  why not just use the M for higher damage and  recoil it recenters before you can fire again which is effectively no recoil.Its going to have a mag clip to make its automatic function useful aka spamming close quarters when panicking which is a legitimate bonus of using a weapon like this. ,KineticCode,dasyaiy,2,t5_3e5cg
