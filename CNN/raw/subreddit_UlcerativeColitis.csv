8571805,0,t3_4x2ia0,Im sorry you are having to deal with this at such a young age.  I am  years old.  I have had a jpouch since I was   years!.  It changed my life for the better.  Before the surgery I was in and out of the hospital.  After I recovered from the surgery I learned to ski downhill ran a marathon bicycled a century  miles in a day several times got married survived cancer travelled around the world and have otherwise lived a very full life.  The surgery and recovery is not easy but possible.  There will be ups and downs but it can give you a new lease on life.    Wishing you the best on Saturday.,UlcerativeColitis,d6d22sg,2,t5_2tb9x

10527526,0,t3_5qq1ec,Ill reiterate the dont stress and just breathe. Ive had UC since I was . I have a family full time job take road trips and lead a pretty normal life when not in a flare. The flares vary from time to time. But Ive gone many long stretches without flares. Most recently over  years  then had  flares in  years  and been good for almost a year. Ive recently done FMLA paperwork for work purposes just to keep myself covered legally. If you are in the USA go to HR and request FMLA paperwork. Thatll help on the job front. If you are turned down  it sometimes happens  contact the number provided and ask why. Then youll have to resubmit the paperwork.  It looks intimidating  just take the packet to your doctor  theyll know what to do. Keep a food diary  track what you ate and when and if it bothered you and how it bothered you.  I eat differently whether Im in a flare or not.  Take your meds. Dont be afraid to request different medication or dosages though so that you can find what works best for you. For me even switching up the time of day I take my medication matters.  Its a process to find what works.  sometimes the doctors are just figuring it out with you But its worth it.  Feel free to PM me.  Im happy to listen  answer whatever I can.  ,UlcerativeColitis,dd1erb5,4,t5_2tb9x
