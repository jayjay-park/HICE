2023990,0,t3_2hmfq9,Meh I am still not  sure why but I am not too big a fan of the latest installment of Pahkitew Island maybe after I rewatch it I will enjoy it better.  Sky was definitely one of the better characters in the season with Jasmine Shawn Scarlett Max and Ella probably being the others maybe Dave too not sure on him but her overarching character seemed flat for the series.  Sporty girl likes guy and they have a weird relationship which is nice as it sets precedent for a different season of sorts and allows some diverse characters to shine.  But something just felt off putting to me.  Like the show lost its edge and was more of a cartoon.  Not necessarily a bad thing but I thought there were a few too many joke characters and a lack of hmm what is the word for it.  Probably depth to the competition portion of the show.  Just felt like team loses no alliances or debating and then a person got voted out On to the person we are talking about so I at least stay on point.  Sky is one of the better characters of the season bar none.,Totaldrama,ckx3bsn,1,t5_2u6ph
