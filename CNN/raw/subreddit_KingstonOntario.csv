5848423,0,t1_cxlv415,I disagree in general but lets pick out one specific point you keep making.Who said anything about refugees having stayed  years in camps?Shows how naive and out of touch you evidently are.You do realize the ministers are winging this as they go along right? The  years in camps is just something they said in one of the answers to placate the reporters questions. Whether or not they will eventually get people from camps who have stayed that long you will only know once people arrive but I doubt they will release those sort of stats. In fact they only just recently started sending bureaucrats on the ground to process people with weeks to go until the new year. Furthermore it is the UN who hands them a list to choose from so UN calls the shots and bureaucrats work with whats given.You want to bet that there will be a lot of refugees who eventually make it here who have not spent  years in camps like you seem to think? In fact they are not taking people just from camps but outside of it too now. The ministers cant even get their stories and policies straight. Theyve changed their plans tweeked it backpeddled  millions of times since the announcement of taking in refugees. The fact is they will do whatever they will do to take in the K for now. Thats about the only thing you can count on not this  years in camp bull.Regarding your general view take another look around. What about just the most recent news events that happened yesterday. You think they have anything to do with being so called operatives of any kind? Theyre just radicals because they feel loyal to their religion that they all share. Thats about as much as any connection goes. The world isnt black and white with everyone holding official titles. These arnt always official operatives with the uniform badge and title sent to cause trouble everywhere. Many of these radicals often start out being simple everyday people who got pissed off about something over their religion and its beliefs and their disagreements with your way of life. The way you think is scary and will just make us less safe if everybody in charge of security thinks like you. Youre not getting at the root of the problem. Youre being too superficial.,KingstonOntario,cxm991y,1,t5_2s8kp

10852195,0,t1_ddza09u,You can call Property Standards to report potentially dangerous issues with properties as well as just unsightly ones. So if you think its a structural issue it becomes a public safety issue and the city will investigate. For example a friend of mine lived by Queens and watched her neighbours burn out the front bottom corner of the house. The sill was done for. The owner came by and just replaced the siding one afternoon so that it looked like nothing happened. She called the city because the structural damage was so bad it wasnt safe and they made him repair it properly. So if youre concerned on that level you can always try that route. You can also call the Real Estate agent and ask if theyre aware. Really though it does come down to the buyer being thorough and seeing these problems before they buy. ,KingstonOntario,ddzbs7x,3,t5_2s8kp
