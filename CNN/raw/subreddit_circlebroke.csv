If its nice enough you may want to put it on display or you may be one of the people who successfully uses it in selfdefense. It could also be used to kill or injure but compared to all the safe ways guns can also be used Americans have decided that it is not worth it to outlaw guns.This is not to mention all the economic activity tied to guns which cannot be said of drunk driving.,circlebroke,cfjy388,0,t5_2tnz9

When we say race dont real we mean there is no not a geneticist no expert real genetic or biological basis for what constitutes one race or another. Its all madeup  its all construct. If races were real wouldnt there be a point genetically or biologically where anyone could say without doubt whether someone was one race or not? And what would these categories of race even be? The false dichotomy of black and white seems easy but when you consider the entire human race its almost absurd to suggest that there are real divisions  its just one big blur of features.I feel like youre trying to meet us here youre just unfamiliar with the idea of race as an invention. Thats why I brought up ethnology earlier  its the essence of pseudoscience in th century and its purely applied towards slave apologia. And even then slavers were highly skeptical that races were scientifically justifiable it clashed with the lineage of Adam and Eve. It was contentious then its nonsense now.Although...

You interact with faceless streams of texts that you cant ever truly relate to as an individual. And since people only see you as a username and avatar you can be as much of an asshole as you care to be without ever actually facing any consequences in the real world.

660559,0,t1_cgfca5k,It is difficult for people to accept things that are out of their control. rchildfree is one way they cope with this fact. They gain some sense of belonging and self worth by being able to converse with people in similar situations to their own. A byproduct of this of course is a lot of venting and moaning that is resulting from the bitterness they are experiencing via their newfound isolation. You get enough lonely and bitter people together in one place you will of course get bitterness and angst. I do not say bitter and lonely in a condescending way however I think everyone goes through similar feelings at some point in life and these individuals are in a particularly difficult period of transition from youth in to middle age. They must adjust to dealing with a fairly routine and complacent existence and without a family and children to spice things up combined with the loss of their old friends they will lose a sense of purpose and belonging fairly quickly. There have been a lot of comparisons made to angsty teenagers in these rchildfree threads often coming from a point of condescension but I would actually say it is not a bad comparison. Just as teenagers going through the difficult period of transition between childhood and adulthood are filled with angst and bitterness so too are the adults who are going through the difficult and often less glamorized transition into the middle of life.,circlebroke,cgfcswj,13,t5_2tnz9

The internet allows us to have anything we want at any time. Whether its that movie from thirty years ago or that latest Game of Thrones episode we can have it right now on the internet.The second problem is the low risk of getting caught. In reality nobody really gets in trouble for pirating and its somewhat easy to hide your identity. Couple this with the fact that after you get away with it once you get the urge to do it again and you have a potent combination.The sad thing is all of these people know what theyre doing is wrong. The only reason they hide behind these sad justifications for pirating is because deep down they know what theyre doing is illegal. They just dont have strong enough morals or ethics to overpower their urge for instant gratification. At least admit that you are pirating because you like free shit.

You cant separate it out into a few parts even if you say that there are multiple parts that can coexist. A lot of the book is meant to construct a larger and more highly complex picture than just state controls language or surveillance state is everywhere etc.Another example is with Shooting an Elephant if you take one or two things from it you get a cheaper imitation of the story rather than the one most people end up seeing where hes invalidating the idea of British colonial ambitions being worthwhile and the arbitrariness of saying this or that person is in charge of another.gt The conclusion to be drawn from the book is that there is no state on the earth that is close to being the same as the state Orwell describesYeah there kind of was.

I do these things out of enjoyment not necessity. But even going through these little creative processes makes you realize how fucking hard professional musicians have to work to make this album that Redditors supposedly love but wont even shell out the cost of three cups of coffee or a plate of nachos to support. If you know anyone whos studied film drawing painting etc. you know that each of these products Redditors feel they DESERVE FOR FREE came from the blood sweat and tears of their creator.Contrary to what Redditors may think music movies and TV shows are not just torrents that magically appear. It requires real work and real money to make these things that Redditors take for granted. Sure its always nice to get things for free but for the love of God dont fool yourself into thinking the Pirate Bay dude is somehow a victim here. Christ.,circlebroke,chwqwnh,8,t5_2tnz9

This ownership of originally appropriated places and goods by a person implies his right to use and transform these places and goods in any way he sees fit provided only that he does not change thereby uninvitedly the physical integrity of places and goods originally appropriated by another person. In particular once a place or good has been first appropriated by in John Lockes phrase mixing ones labor with it ownership in such places and goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary  contractual  transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.Since it is this principle through which we derive many of the concepts associated with ancaps it would be useful to know your thoughts on it.,circlebroke,ci9x7on,2,t5_2tnz9

Yet towards the late s to early s it became practically the only major to see the proportion of female enrollment decline and at a rapid pace.So what happened?  Well what happened is the total student enrollment in the major increased but these new CS students were overwhelmingly male.  So why did the major suddenly become popular with men and not women?  Id argue this was because there was a new entertainment phenomenon popular almost exclusively to boys and young men that was closely associated with Computer Science.

Legalization  employers can no longer hold policy over their employees conduct.Yes they can we have atwill employment in most places for most people and as I pointed out above employers fire people for all sorts of petty reasons Im saying that its wrong much as other intrusions into aspects of employees private lives which dont affect their work are wrong.gt And I can do my job fine in sweatpants but theres a business casual dress code here and my company can definitely enforce that if they want to. Its what I agreed to when I signed up for the job and if it bothered me Id have looked elsewhere.I submit to you that theres a difference between the company regulating what you do on company time where it conceivably reflects on the company and regulating what you do on your own time in the privacy of your own home. For example if your employer told you that you couldnt drink on the weekend or couldnt play video games because your employer thinks they encourage violence I think you would find that unreasonable yes?gt If employees were too harsh or unreasonable with practices like that then theyd have no employees at all. No one wants to deal with that and plenty of other companies will take those peoples skills and expertise away from the offender with no trouble at all.I fear that you are living in a fantasy world. At the peak of the recession there were nearly seven unemployed people for every job opening i.e. if every mismatch of skill or location was fixed six out of every seven unemployed people would still be unemployed no matter how cleanly they lived or how many resumes they sent out or how many classes they took It would now be roughly half. See Chart  in the linked PDF note that the rate of people quitting their jobs fell by half during the recession. I dont think its because employers suddenly became nicer en masse.The labor market is a buyers market and has been for at least a decade.

If you could see through my eyes would the colours be the same as what you see through your eyes?whoagtMaybe nobody views colours the same way.Say I see something that is commonly accepted as blue in my mind it is blue in other peoples mind it is blue.But what if my blue is someone elses orange and my brown is someone elses white?There is no way to prove people process colours the same way  I think? so this could be true.whoa,circlebroke,ck5ozq1,14,t5_2tnz9

1800673,0,t1_ck5z8ox,They quote statistics that show in France African immigrants mainly North African commit more crime. Or how in Norway the majority of rapes are done by immigrants. Or how East Europeans are reducing number of British jobs due to lower pay request. etc etc. But the problem with just quoting statistics is that they rarely show the actual full picture of the situation and just mainly onesided. They can also be false for example the commonly quoted statistics about  of rapes in Norway being committed by immigrants is false and the police report put it at . and also included this At the same time part of the explanation may be that the inclination to report on the part of women is greater when unwanted or degrading events take place in connection with nonNorwegian persons than when Norwegian men are involved. It is easier to report aliens than people you know yourself or are networked to. Rape and crime in general are a really nuanced issue that is impossible to capture on statistics. My main problem with people who love to quote racial disproportionality statistics in relation to crime is that they never questionhave no problem with gender disproportionality statistics or class disproportionality statistics in relation to crime. They actual get ridiculously offended at feminist if they dare question why men are committing more crimes and what can be done about it. ,circlebroke,ck64r44,16,t5_2tnz9

2070843,0,t1_cl2bkqw,gtwhat Im saying is that eugenics as applied to intelligence is a crock of shit because theres no way wed be able to select for something which is that incredibly complex in its genetic expression.Lets compare this to breeding the perfectly IVed Pokemon better analogy than Poker.  The perfect Pokemon has base  IVs or Individual Values in every stat HP Attack Defense Special Attack Special Defense and Speed.  Now lets say we have a  Pokemon and we breed it with a  Pokemon.  Theres no guarantee we get our ideal  offspring we may get a shitty  Pokemon.  However the offspring is still much more likely to be stronger than the offspring of two shittier  Pokemon.So you cant just claim intelligence is a bunch of genes therefore breeding for it doesnt work.  Thats ludicrous.  It will still work.  Breeding smart people is still more likely to produce smart offspring than two dummies.  It will just take more generations to achieve an ideal result.gtIQ does not equal intelligence. Its a horrible measurement based on a tiny portion of the larger body of behaviors and abilities which we describe as intelligence.No it doesnt.  By it does bear mentioning that there is a very significant correlation between intelligence tests.  High performers on one tend to perform higher on others.  IQ is definitely flawed but the correlation between high IQ scores and smart people still very much exists.gt I couldve been raised in a tiny village in Northeast India never having learned to read or do algebra and I could still be very smart.You mean genetically smart?  Yes thats one concern.  In order to properly administer a eugenics program you would have to control for the environment each subject is raised in which is pretty impossible at the current point in time.Though still this does that mean that a eugenics program would be ineffective it just means that it would be incredibly inefficient and classist.  True many viable breeding subjects would be unfairly sterilized but on the whole the proportion of breeding people would shift more towards intelligence.The trap many eugenics naysayers fall into is to claim that eugenics would be ineffective.  Thats pretty false.  Eugenics would definitely accomplish its intended goal.  The only biological issue is that reducing genetic diversity would weaken humanity in unperceived ways.  Wed possibly be weaker to many diseases.  The more major issue is one of ethics regarding each individuals free will.,circlebroke,cl31sr0,1,t5_2tnz9

4520399,0,t1_ct05xze,There does seem to be a theme of fixing the mental disorder which does signal a lack of knowledge of history medicine biology etc. With the developmet of psychiatry in the early th century and the new procedures that came with it such as electro shock treatment the general consensus for treatment of such deviancies did consist of such things. The most infamous example from history being Atascadero State HospitalgtAt Atascadero State Hospital doctors were permitted under an obscure California law to commit those who practiced sodomy into the hospital. gtOnce admitted men and women were rendered mentally disabled through castration lobotomies forced chemical treatments and experimental treatments such as a drug which simulated the effects of drowning. This earned it the tag of Dachau For QueersgtThe most notorious was a Dr. Walter J. Freeman who perfected the ice pick lobotomy. He jammed an ice pick through a homosexuals eyes into the brain and performed a primitive lobotomy. According to records he treated over  patients this way around America and it is estimated that nearly  to  were homosexuals. He believed deeply this was the only way to cure homosexuality. gtThe difficulty in documenting so much of this history is that most of the records history and data have been destroyed. Families were often adamant about not leaving any trace of the overwhelming shame of having a homosexual in the family and they often erased the gay relatives presence on earth. Many individuals who were terrorized died in the institutions or were made mentally disabled with an inability to recall. Or unable because of their torture to share their journal. The NHS in the UK also had practices such as day long induced nausea courses until the s which can be seen in the documentary Cure me Im gay by Dr. Christian Jessen. The consensus remained unchanged until German born sexologist Harry Benjamin was contacted by Alfred Kinsey in gtIn  in San Francisco Benjamin was asked by Alfred Kinsey a fellow sexologist to see a child who wanted to become a girl despite being born male the mother wished for help that would assist rather than thwart the child. Kinsey had encountered the child as a result of his interviews for Sexual Behavior in the Human Male which was published that year. Kinsey and Benjamin had seen nothing of the like previously. gtThis child rapidly led Benjamin to understand that there was a different condition to that of transvestism under which adults who had such needs had been classified to that time. Despite the psychiatrists with whom Benjamin involved in the case not agreeing on a path of treatment Benjamin eventually decided to treat the child with estrogen Premarin introduced in  which had good results because the estrogen changed the body to what the transgender child thought it should be and helped arrange for the mother and child to go to Germany where surgery to assist the child could be performed but from there they ceased to maintain contact to Benjamins regret. gtHowever Benjamin continued to refine his understanding and went on to treat several hundred patients with similar needs in a similar manner often without accepting any payment. However due to the personal political opinions of the American doctors and a Danish law prohibiting sex reassignment surgery on noncitizens these doctors referred the letterwriters to the one doctor of the era who would aid transsexual individuals Harry Benjamin. Benjamin conducted treatment with the assistance of carefully selected colleagues of various disciplines. gtThe legal social and medical background to this in the United States as in many other countries was often a stark contrast since wearing items of clothing associated with the opposite sex in public was often illegal castration of a male was often illegal anything seen as homosexuality was often persecuted or illegal and many doctors considered all such people including children best treated by forced treatments such as drugged detention electroconvulsive therapy or lobotomy.Publicity surrounding his patient Christine Jorgensen brought the issue into the mainstream in  and led to a great many people presenting for assistance internationally. In the preface of Christine Jorgensens autobiography Dr. Benjamin also gives Jorgensen credit for the advancement of his studies. He wrote Indeed Christine without you probably none of this would have happened the grant my publications lectures etc.gtWhen the New York Daily News December   carried a frontpage story under the headline ExGI Becomes Blonde Bombshell announcing that Christine Jorgensen had become the recipient of the first sex change it caused a sensation. However the claim that this was the first was not true as this type of surgery had previously been performed by pioneering German doctors in the late s and early s. gtShe became an instant celebrity using the platform to advocate for transgender people and became known for her directness and polished wit. She also worked as an actress and nightclub entertainer and recorded several songs. Jorgensen grew up in the Bronx New York City. Shortly after graduating from high school in  she was drafted into the US Army for World War II. After her service she attended several schools worked and around this time heard about transitioning surgery. gtShe travelled to Europe and in Copenhagen Denmark obtained special permission to undergo a series of operations starting in . During a stopover in Copenhagen to visit relatives she met Dr. Christian Hamburger a Danish endocrinologist and specialist in rehabilitative hormonal therapy. Jorgensen then stayed in Denmark and took hormone replacement therapy under Dr. Hamburgers direction. She obtained special permission from the Danish Minister of Justice to undergo a series of operations in that country. She referred to how the surgery affected her in a letter to friends on October   gtAs you can see by the enclosed photos taken just before the operation I have changed a great deal. But it is the other changes that are so much more important. Remember the shy miserable person who left America? Well that person is no more and as you can see Im in marvelous spirits.But it wasnt until the s did people in general start to distinguish between common queens such as drag queens and transgender as an identitygtIn  Harry Benjamin wrote the Transsexual Phenomenon which further helped transgender people establish their identity. Though he had already published papers and lectured to professional audiences extensively Benjamins  book was immensely important as the first large work describing and explaining the affirmative treatment path he pioneered. gtIn  perhaps his first transsexual femaletomale who was later known as Reed Erickson  did seek help from Benjamin. With Ericksons inherited fortune he established the Erickson Educational Foundation to publish booklets to help educate the public about those who are transgender. But most of Benjamins patients lived and many still live quiet lives.Exposure to the mainstream continues in the s with transgender women appearing on TV having discussions about their experiencesgtIf society would let me live my life as I want to live it which is a respectable normal ordinary woman period. I dont run around in mini skirts I dont run around with my hair sticking  foot off my head and all the rest of the stuff the queens do which is a category Im classified as a common queen period. I cant get away from it no matter what I do Im put into this category Im labeled as this gtI went out to try and get a job in mens clothing  no youre too effeminate youre a fggot youre a sissy youre this youre that. So I thought well groovy. So I put on the clothes I usually wear which is girls clothes. I went out to try and get a job as a woman. This doesnt work you last  weeks before somebody recognises you who prefers to be a hooker and a tramp turns around to your boss and says so and so is such and such and thats the end of that job. gtSo finally it reaches a point where you get disgusted with the whole damn bit and you go out on the streets. And you find out you can make  a night and you say to hell with it why should I be legitimate why should I be respectable why should I be anything? gtA few years ago I was grocery shopping and I got thrown in jail for female impersonation. Ive never felt Im impersonating a female I am a female! I think the increasing exposure and decrimininalisation of LGBT people as well as Benjamins book and the progression of psychiatry fasciliated the ability for the medical community general public and gender nonconforming people themselves to be able to differentiate between the bioloigcal and physcological differences between them and change consensus. With progress into biology and understanding of the brain we also see biological influences for transsexualism examples of which can be found under the neuro biology section of rLGBTlibrary. This shifts understanding from a pereption of a male who thinks he is or wants to be female to a female born into a male body and it would be much easier to change the body to match the brain than it would be to make the brain match the body when you take the history and current possibilities of medicine into account. Ignorance of those factors as well as a perception of gender being based on the body and not the brain that leads people to other conclusions IMO,circlebroke,ct0fsfv,23,t5_2tnz9

In fact I find some flaws in that it appears to weasel wording or hedging. Ex Therefore be it further resolved that APA recognizes the efficacy benefit and medical necessity of gender transition treatments for appropriately evaluated individuals and calls upon public and private insurers to cover these medically necessary treatments but they dont recommend it to people anymore.So I cant actually find anyplace where he contradicts that policy. As in OP link he isnt saying to discriminate and the st is saying not to discriminate. Wut?Second link. It cites the evidence he collected showing that  of the sexual abuse was   homosexual in nature and   minors but not qualified for pedophilia. Which is statutory rape and sodomy. in other words the catholic church had formed a culture saying those  things were OK. Moving on!P is misleading. The swedish study says anyone who transitioned more than  years ago. So  year rates are higher than people who didnt receive SRS. The reason they make ANY note of  is because that is the  year mark!P is a single sentence. The OP article does not say to give less help. So this is a straw man.P is setting up the strawman further.

4576029,0,t1_ct7drcq,SCOTUS even ruled that way recently. The Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that policies that segregate minorities in poor neighborhoods even if they do so unintentionally violate the Fair Housing Act. The thinking is that the result is discrimination based on race racial segregation in housing for the purposes of that case and that the intentions behind the policies that create those results are irrelevant in the face of the actual results of those policies.  To apply the same logic to Reddit the policies of the admins have led to Reddit being a haven at various points for child pornographers racists sexists bigots and people full of hate of all kinds like the FPH sub which doesnt really fall into a traditional ism or the scope of bigotry. Unless forced through outside means like say Anderson Cooper exposing the child porn the policies of Reddit are to allow it to continue unabated and on a surprisingly frequent basis their policies actually punish those who try to stop the horrible shit that goes on especially if doxxing is involved like with the violentacrezcreepshots fiasco. Theyve gone so far as to say that its a bannable offense to even mention or link a public commentpost made by someone where they reveal their own information.The end result of these policies is that a significant portion of Reddit not most of it mind you but a decent portion of it that is hard to ignore caters to bigots and hate. Because Reddit is built to allow easy access to ALL public subreddits those people can and do easily spread to the rest of the site and sometimes brigade youll see it often when people comment rHateful Subreddit is leaking but nothing is done about it. They spread their hateful ideas among the defaults and the more mindless andor innocuous subs that cater to younger more impressionable minds rpics or radviceanimals or any number of the more inane but harmless defaults over the years and turn them into easy recruiting grounds for their hatesubs.Also up until the last year or so the admins did nothing about the Squatzis but thats another issue all together.tldr  The end result is more important than the intent when discussing whether a policy or course of action is racist.,circlebroke,ct7ezpz,23,t5_2tnz9

I subscribe to a bunch of smaller subreddits and took the advice to ignore the defaults its great and everything but once I check the majority of posts for the day my links are all purple. I torture myself and venture into rall and see nothing but low effort rule breaking shitposts so I started a little experiment and I do what the mods constantly say to defend their lack of moderationfavoritismlazinessrule enforcementetc. report the posts that violate the rules of the subreddit. For example I can go through the front page of rfunny and half the posts blatantly violate  or more rules. I report the post and continue my day. I will hop back on after a few hours and check my history and notice the posts are still up. I usually give up on default reports unless one is so blatantly shitty I just cant take it. I do notice that the smaller or growing subs I subscribe to actually seem to care about the quality of their subs and seem to enforce rules like rblackpeopletwitter I report a few posts and they actually seem to read reports and take action. Its good to see that especially for such a sub thats going through a major influx in growth. Speaking of smaller subs exploding it made me notice power users just crapping the place up. If you were to go on rall I see the same handful of users multiple times on the first few pages. It sucks. I hate it. I dont know why I just cant stand it. I hate when they jump on a popular growing sub bandwagon and post their garbage that is vaguely related to the subreddit with a generic click bait title. These posters dont contribute to the smaller communities at all. They just pump and dump. It really lowers the overall quality of the subreddit and when their posts arent moderated it just enables more shit posting.

5250671,0,t1_cviqyno,Me too. I am directly involved with public assistance and when I see clear problems I rarely actually judge the person doing them.We all do what we must to get by.Public assistance is a tiny expenditure compared to what else we spend our money on. The rich steal a lot of our productivity no matter what we do. Theyve managed to control all levels of Government. They work against us. When youre on public aid your life sucks. A lot.A lot.You will never have enough money to really get by. You will always have to sacrifice necessities.If you are disabled youre double fucked.If youre in a tight spot you might be able to get free.No matter what happened you will be thought of as worthless scum by the people who are most likely to be caught in your position themselves. And often times by people that have gamed the systems themselves and benefited from it hugely. We have a hard time understanding that our society is built around very specific kinds of direct welfare so we take them for granted because they may not take the form of direct cash assistance. We all drive on welfare roads eat welfare food go to welfare school are protected by welfare soldiers take welfare approved drugs have our house fires put out by welfare fireman. Everything we do is at some point touched by some kind of government welfare. There is no shame in it. Some things the government is just far better at doing than any profit motivated corporation would ever be. So if a person spends a million dollars in taxpayer resources having their home protected we think nothing of it.If a person receives  dollars a month in federal cash assistance because they live in a world of crippling pain theyre a leech on society.Its totally fucked up.I have a litmus test for people that I apply a lot especially on Reddit If you believe people on cash assistance are somehow less of a person than you then you arent worth much as a person to me. ,circlebroke,cviw82k,16,t5_2tnz9

5733865,0,t1_cx75aix,gt As I have said before I dont think its unethical for a group of people to gather and say other people cant join. Those are valid concerns.Im not the guy youre arguing but Im very confused.This is a place where a group of people are gathering and saying other people cannot join. You say this is unethical.The people that are gathering are people of color. Theyre people with experiences that people not of color in the US are significantly less likely to relate to. They are allowed to invite others who are not PoC who are trusted to respect the concerns and context of this meeting.But you say its unethical to group up at a privately owned coffee shop for a short time while allowing non PoC to attend at any other time or by invitation during this time.Was that a typo or...? I read your conversation but I dont see how this differs.I think youre ignoring the connotation of the word segregation and thats why people are disagreeing.Technically yes it is a form of segregation but it isnt the same kind of racial segregation that is usually discussed.If it has no negative social effects if youre a consequentialist it is not unethical. How do you figure an action with no bad effects is bad? Thats a totally different moral paradigm.I also think its key to remember WHY they are rejecting non PoCs from the meeting. Its not because they dont like white people I think.There are two major reasons I can see them wanting to reject whites it does seem funny putting it that way but it is what theyre doing yes. Still remember the context behind it rather than the words itself except by invitation  to avoid the kind of privileged backtalkbrogressiveness that exists. What I mean is take a look at the people in KiA and TheRedPill and other subs. They run rampant with pseudoprogressive racism and race realism and subtle superiority complexes. These kinds of people really do exist and real life and at times speak up. In a place where groups of people have experienced a certain racial bias and certain negative experiences correlated to their race I cant prove causation here its a much broader discussion it is unsettling to unload this baggage. Now imagine after discussing a charged subject that deeply affects you someone who does not share your genetic makeup or your experiences due to this genetic makeup decides to dismiss your views publicly. Which leads me to my next point which is... They have not experienced what PoC do in this nation necessarily. I as a white cisgendered heterosexual male have rarely if ever been the other in any room. Even in all black rooms the worst Ive ever been seen as to my knowledge is racist. Its funny because the black people I have known have never been concerned that I may be lazy stupid rude loud or anything like that their biggest concern is whether I think THAT of them based on their race. Anecdotal sure but I think youll find this is common among PoC. I imagine this concept can seem dismissive Just because Im not their race doesnt mean I cant relate! Isnt that racist in itself!? That is a fair point but its not them looking down on you. One comparison is when my father died. Im only  so its a weird experience. But I got a lot of people telling me how much better life will get who had both their parents still. It really was a slap in the face to hear these sentiments because it showed a total lack of perspective. This is why as a person I try to recognize my experience is a small bubble that only overlaps on very specific events with all kinds of people not just colored or white or gay or straight or male or female or only child or whatever the fuck I can think of. I think that may be necessary to keep in mind with this subject.I think by keeping white folk away from this meeting excluding those who were trusted by PoC is meant not to separate or segregate whites based on color but to minimize the amount of potential discomfort and such when discussing an EXTREMELY tense subject.Im not saying youre wrong but I think this is something you should read to at least understand where were coming from. Im not going to attack you or belittle you or anything. Shoot this may be common knowledge to you already I dont know. But there are a lot of rational good people who approach these subjects this way. And Im pretty passionate about allowing people to discuss subjects like these. I just think youre looking at it without properly recognizing all the context. Which is easy really and i do it all the time. Im genuinely interested in hearing your response to this. Maybe theres something Im missing about the situation? ,circlebroke,cx7ubef,2,t5_2tnz9

6030543,1,t1_cya370e,I think some of the gendered insults dont really reflect the reason for the dislike though. Some people including women will call someone a bitch because shes a despicable person who happens to be female not because shes female. Same with calling a guy a dick. There are a lot of reasons to dislike Hillary. Shes too phony. I went to see her speak once when she was still First Lady and was really disappointed at the dull shallow platitudes she used to pander to an Ivy League university audience that deserved some more thoughtful remarks. Early Hillary gave me the same sort of creepily overpolished puttingonanact vibe that John Edwards did or that Martin OMalley does now. Hillary has become much better about that but probably by becoming a better actress not by being more sincere. Its just hard to trust people who are obviously acting out a crafted persona. Its hard to trust Hillary in particular because of the number of lies shes told in the past and her unwillingness to own up to them. And the number of times shes shifted positions to pander to one group or another. All politicians do these things to some extent but shes really worse than average. Ultimately I do think shes a fairly intelligent wellmeaning person. Shes just overly focused on political expedience and too willing to compromise her longterm principles to get a shortterm win. She also badly misunderstands some issues like encryption. And shes not the greatest judge of character valuing personal loyalty above competence and ethical standards. Shes one of my least favorite wellknown Democrats.If you really want to see if a Hillaryhater is hating Hillary for sexist reasons see what they think of Elizabeth Warren. I bet in many cases theyre big fans. These people arent opposed to women in power but to Hillary specifically for many legitimate reasons and they just express their distaste in crude genderspecific ways.,circlebroke,cya4f2y,2,t5_2tnz9

I actually stopped eating meat because I got disgusted with how desensitized I had become to what it was had a moment of clarity when walking around the grocery store filled with chopped up animals and how little I actually knew about their suffering. I eat meat now so I dont think any of it is absolutely wrong but I think we as a society are a bit to quick to use that excuse and we should feel more obligated to understand the toll that is paid for the meat we eat so that we can make a responsible decision.Thats why I called it being defensive. It instantly became about the persons feeling on vegetarianism and why they arent doing the right thing and them trying to justify it. Despite me not passing any judgement on them at all.Like I said in a previous reply you can kinda tell when a person gets a bit defensive and saying Im a vegetarian was always something I dreaded because it felt like I was cornering them or something.

If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Its not fake.If youre saying a bit rubbish youre referring to a judgment of the quality of the order which includes things like too much splenda to weird choice of nonfat with cream to Starbucks coffee is generally crap.So your reasoning for calling a real order a fake order is because random people call the orders with weird choices fake. Lets get chai lattes and green tea lattes in there then too.Also calling someone Whitney or pampered white girl? Its not one or the other thats not how crude name based observations work. Theyre both. A Whitney is a pampered white girl and an orderer of heavily sweetened Vanilla lattes. But thats not what you said.

Ill pull out the quotes where I disagree with yougtAccording to math educator and curriculum designer Maria Droujkova youre absolutely right. Teachers arent going to be able to resolve an issue inherent to the way math is taught. The method and order of instruction are to blame for the fear of math many of us are familiar with. Calculations kids are forced to do are often so developmentally inappropriate the experience amounts to torture she says. top reply Ok so there is some hyperbole at the end but frankly the idea that a lot of kids get scared of math or need different methods to get engaged with math isnt super controversial. And the woman in the quote seems fairly qualified in early math education. I would have been better to just focus on how redditors interpreted the quote.gtBut there is really no difference between multiplying  and . After youve learned the first you could easily apply it to the second it would just be a waste of time.  higher scoreIm not sure if you are arguing in bad faith or just shit at reading between the lines but the poster was refering to the fact that those two numbers would be multiplied he didnt say with what using the same methods by most people. He was being dismissive of the other comment but your response is just pissy.gtAs a Calc teacher. Calculus is easy teachers just make it artificially difficultThats not what he said and he wasnt saying the algebra was unnecessary. And to be frank I heard that quote from a fair amount of my teachers when I was in school. And you could teach some basic concepts of calculus before you finish algebra. Stuff like Riemann sums arent that hard and the already know about slopes for linear equations by the end of Algebra .gtA string of buzzwordsNo. Isolate and variable are not hard words to use.gtAnd if you forgot the Chain Rule just look it up.He didnt forget how to do it. He just forgot to do it skipped the step. Also you are getting way mad about exaggeration again.I kind of support you OP because there is a huge antimath jerk going on there but you are pissing on some of the posts that speak positively about learning more complicated math just because you dont like or misinterpreted their wording.,circlebroke,czna3zy,4,t5_2tnz9

6535432,0,t1_czufgn4,Im really sorry that you feel so frustrated truly in this post and your original above.But I have real trouble believing that any significant proportion of Bernie supporters are really Bernie Bros though. And genuinely I think that a only a sliver of a sometimes loud minority would be foolish enough to vote for a Republican if Hillary got the nomination.I made another post about this below as well but I think the vast perhaps quieter majority of Bernie supporters just think he is the better candidate on the issues and Hillary or sexism does not come into play. Thats where I stand and I originally started supporting Sanders thinking he almost certainly wouldnt win but hoping he would pull Hillary further left because I think shes too far right on the issues I care about.However as hes gained ground Ive started to hope that he might actually have a chance. Im still not convinced thats true because the political establishment really is very powerful and Hillary may be a woman but shes still a veteran of that establishment.I really  honestly think that this is a caricature being spread around either to win political points or simply as a meme in Hillary echo chambers. And please understand that when I say echo chamber I am not being dismissive or condemning I simply mean any place where one ideology or cause is so prevalent that it dominates all discussion. I would consider rSandersForPresident an echo chamber as well for instance. I use the term because echo chambers of various sorts are so so prevalent on the internet these days and I think they can really cause blind spots for people.Anyway I could certainly be wrong. It sounds like you have encountered a lot of Bernie Bros and if its outside of reddit then thats certainly a cause for concern reddit is full of a handful of loud people and a massive silent majority so shitty opinions on reddit dont really make me think that those opinions are common in the world at large. Are they actually people you know and are they actually claiming that theyll vote for Bernie and nobody else? That doesnt match my experience but its possible that Im just lucky or that youre just unlucky.Everyone I know who are not straightup conservatives certainly understands that whichever candidate gets the nomination is the only candidate we can vote for. They understand that Republicans can absolutely not be trusted with any of the things that matter to us as liberals.,circlebroke,czvbdzn,2,t5_2tnz9

6563137,0,t1_czy5d97,Thats an awfully presumptuous conclusion to draw from two Reddit posts of mine.If youre looking at the younger generation in disbelief unable to reconcile their beliefs with yours then maybe the problem isnt that an entire generation is illeducated on the subject but rather that we just have different opinions. Maybe when you got into politics it was enough just to make a call for womens rights to be on the cuttingedge of the the social justice movement at least in the domain of popular political discourse. Its certainly true that feminism has come leaps and bounds within just the last two decades and it wasnt until very recently that wide swaths of the progressive movement began turning their attention to the pitfall that is white feminism. Maybe in the early s it was refreshing to see a strong woman in politics  in  we didnt even have Boxer and Warren in Congress yet.Maybe that was the case then though its not like feminism was in its infancy in the s or anything but we can at least say that a lot of issues of social justice werent nearly as mainstream as they are now but things are different now. As I said you cant try be a champion for womens rights in America while carrying out corrupt bargains with Saudi Arabia  whose human rights record I dont need to mention  and then expect to be lauded as a feminist. Movements are broader in scope and in inclusion.Its easy to be dismissive  not to mention patronizing  and chalk your disagreements with younger generations up to a knowledge gap. And the worst part about that is that if youre a wellinformed individual then youre probably right that you have a wider breadth of knowledge than people younger than you. Even if youre only  years older than me you probably at least remember the Clinton administration and didnt need to learn everything about it in old news articles and books. But for crying out loud dont tell me to broaden my horizons and then have the audacity to think that the only reason that people might disagree with you is if theyre misinformed. I cant tell you how frustrating and simultaneously hilarious it is to see all these armchair critics wax philosophic about how college students arent intellectually challenged and in the same breath refusing to consider the validity of any of the grievances of the younger generation. Theyre completely missing the point that were not asking you to immediately agree with everything we say. Were asking for a discourse on new issues that previous generations might not have even considered. And when the response is Youre too young and naive go read a few books and come back theres no discourse happening.If I wanted an echochamber the time I spend on reddit would be completely in rSandersForPresident and rSocialism. I wouldnt be in this thread where pretty much nobody agrees with me. I wouldnt be getting a second major in Economics taking class after class from rightofcenter laissezfaire professors for the soul purpose of challenging my beliefs and gaining more knowledge in subjects Im interested in. an example of something you cant guess from a reddit postYou dont have to agree with me. Hell please disagree with me. You dont even have to have to same definition of what makes a feminist as I do. But if you want to exhibit the same openmindedness that youre demanding of others maybe consider that other people can be just as wellinformed as you and still have different opinions. that I might heaven forbid! disagree with you on the basis of ideology and not because I think what you say is stupid or lame or because I dont know what Im talking about.If youre not willing to do consider that youre going to be continuously baffled by anything that doesnt fit your paradigm and any advice about this coming from you is just going to sound like hypocrisy.,circlebroke,czy6lqn,4,t5_2tnz9

Lots of pundits were saying oh Sanders will win Vermont and maybe one other and then Hillary can claim the nomination tonight.Not at all. I did the delegate math last night based on the Green Papers and the delegate margin from last night alone which mind you these are southern states that Clinton performs especially well in from more moderate black voters she won a lot of them in  too was only . Not the landslide victory Clinton wanted or probably should have had.Funnily enough Clinton didnt earn a single delegate in Vermont which hasnt happened to Sanders anywhere yet. She didnt hit  in a single Congressional District nor at large. Even in South Carolina Bernie racked up at least a single delegate from every district and at large.Its also incredibly important to remember the early contests are overwhelmingly the most southern which benefits Clinton significantly. Late March and all of April look to be several consecutive big wins for Sanders. If he can carry that momentum towards June and the big prize of California thats his path to the nomination. Its slim but theres still math that works especially if he can hit his stride with endorsements. Tulsi Gabbards power move came a bit too late for Super Tuesday but I have a feeling it will make a difference for the contests in the coming weeks.Tldr Its not over stop counter jerking yourselves raw.,circlebroke,d0ky7gb,32,t5_2tnz9

I believe his trial in absentia was also against the principles of democratic justice too but it obviously wasnt necessary for the revolutionary change. Its not as if Tunisia would be ruled by him again if they were waiting for his return to put him on trial.gt people ere killed during the Tunisian revolution including several reprisal killings of government officials who were hated for their prerevolutionary actions.The vast majority of these deaths were down to government repression of civilians. This worked against said change and was clearly not something that contributed to it apart from possibly through the unintended consequence of outraging the populace even more. Also the reprisal killings are again  condemnable and  not part of the change itself and clearly not necessary to affect the change.So yeah there clearly are many examples of change by force and even revolutionary change that have happened and can happen without extrajudicial killings.

6966167,0,t3_4b3kku,So I looked up the thread sorted by best and by top.Best First Song is Kanye West.Second is some s pophair metal thing.Third is Bonnie Tyler.Fourth is a movie track by Ennio Morricone who  in my experience is beloved by the counterjerk music subs.Fifth is Queen and now we start the songs you complain about.Sixth is Two Steps From Hell which IDK but its not on your list and all the replies are instrumentalclassical oriented.Seventh is The Protomen which again I dont know and seems like it would fit on your list but isnt there. are shit you complained about but not inappropriate for the theme.  especially with Eye of the tiger and Youre the best around which are basically stereotypes of what OP asked for at this point.TopFirst is MulanAfter that its a mash up of stuff from best.Honestly it seems like mostly stuff Reddit is likely to have heard. Yeah there is queen and stuff but queen has a lot of energetic upbeat songs so its not like they are out of place. There is a lack of hiphop  modern RampB but the rap that does show up isnt just white rap. The big travesty imo is older RampB and soul which has a lot of good songs for that list that I dont see represented. But are we really surprised here? Reddit knows what they are exposed to which is why the only stuff that isnt dad rock or dad pop is newer stuff. There isnt really any Beatles era stuff or Chuck Berry era stuff or Sinatra or Jazz. And a lot of the more egregious choices arent too highly upvoted or are in a list of other stuff that could offset the bad choice.

Before this it tended to go something like I dated this girl once whose family was from Taiwan and they hated being called Chinese! followed by a bunch of white Americans debating the irrelevant technicalities of the topic while showing a massive misunderstanding of the history and the current dynamics of the region. There were a few times where I tried to jump in and correct them  I quickly learned this was useless  and they would try to correct me...on my own culture and historyBut yeah at least there was a slight chance before that you could get something halfreasonable out of it before. Now as soon as anyone sees the word Taiwan on this site the top response is always TAIWAN NUMBER ONE upvoted to like . I mean I wont lie I laughed when I first saw the video and when aggressive Chinese netizens show up it is a pretty silly way to rile them up but I really dont get how its still a thing.I guess its not too different from any other dumb joke reddits beaten to death but theres an added level of hate for me since honestly its just perpetuating the ignorance and misinformation regarding ChinaTaiwan. It doesnt require any creativity or intelligence either its literally just parroting one line in a context thats not even relevant  of the time. It adds absolutely nothing to the topic and its fucking irritating when at the slightest mention of Taiwan theres like  replies saying the same stupid thing. Especially when its a topic about legitimate news like when our elections happened back in January or when the big earthquake hit TainanKaohsiung a few weeks later.

I still take Uber because I get better service.With cabs Im at the bottom of the list as Im a free fare I cant see where the cab is at any given time and I know just how old and beat up the cars are. Trying to reach my driver in case he cant see me is a crap shoot because I dont have the numbers for all of the drivers and dispatch is too busy fielding actual calls to get me through to my driver.All of that said I golf about once a month with the owner of that cab company AND tip around  bucks per ride which goes right into the drivers pocket with no cut to the owner.I prefer Uber for the sake of convenience the clean cars the fact that my average fare is only marginally higher than what I would tip my cabbie and it works around me instead of the other way around.Believe it or not one CAN prefer Uber without being a classist racist shithead. If local cab companies would upgrade their fleets and develop or buy an app comparable to Uber for their drivers Id swap back in no time.

10351265,0,t1_dcfk8bn,I think that theres a point to defend some form of freedom from economic consequences for speech especially private speech.  I feel the same way about no platform on some form of the Internet.First off I think having some sort of platform where all opinions are allowed is a necessary thing.  The Internet is the most used platform for discussion of political and social issues and news events.  Its sort of what a pub used to be  neighbors gather and discuss things.  A place to be social to goof off to vent or to give your opinion on something that matters to you.  Weve come to the point where the vast majority of people are getting their news from social media than traditional means.  But this does give the people running these sites power that governments can only dream of.  The power to delete news for example the Ferguson protests never got big on Facebook while the ice bucket challenge did so people using Facebook but not Twitter didnt see much of that protest the power to push a person out for saying the wrong thing the power to delete things that dont agree with whatever the values of that company are.  The upshot of this arrangement is that essentially weve handed power over our discussion of news politics and social issues to a set of unaccountable private companies.  Facebook could easily change TOS and the feed algorithm to promote anything it wants to.  If they decide to go Nazi then only that kind of content will make your news feed.  If theyd rather be communist then thats what will be whats on the feed.  And chances are that youd never be informed of the bias and if theyre good you might not even see it right away.  Even if you did theres nothing you can really do to change it.  If you leave you leave friends behind and if youre a writer you shut yourself out of a huge audience.  You can say things that they dont like on a platform that few people will ever know exists and more than likely few people will ever note your protest or consider your opinions.  The second thing Id point out is that everyone on earth says things in one context that they would be punished for in another.  You probably talk about different topics at work than you would at home.  You wouldnt tell that dirty joke in front of your grandma that you tell to your friends.  You wouldnt talk politics at the office.  Except that the Internet gets rid of most of these distinctions.  That one stupid joke you made  years ago its online waiting for someone to find it.  Theres no real way to segment your friends as you do in life.  Yet because these things are both open and permanent its an economic punishment for saying something in one context to one set of friends  years ago and using it against you in a different context.  A dirty joke  years ago to a friend shouldnt be treated as a serious problem.,circlebroke,dchdjs5,4,t5_2tnz9

11204534,0,t1_df1zs4z,You do realise that source goes against what youre proposing right?gt  In  about  percent of women in femaleheaded lowincome working families were high school dropouts percent had a high school diploma and  percenthad at least some post secondary education.The majority of women in low income families have higher education than the minority. Look at your previous comments youve been time and time again stating that women choose these in order to have a family. Keep up.    sources are cited within the subject. I think we can both agree its difficult to find some academic peer reviewed source on this stuff. But feminism has benefited men as well and continues to do so. Heres your issue youre getting all of your sources from social media and what random people on the internet say. Just because a prestigious feminist has used the tag doesnt mean they condone what every single tweet proposes. I thought you just said people dont choose these low paying jobs? But now its all by choice? Will you make up your mind here. Again youre only paying attentions to the actions of people preaching idiotic hate on social media the stuff that will get retweeted and shared on your timeline. I could easily put this generalisation on any movement altright are all nazis because all the things Ive seen about them on social media has been in association with nazi beliefs.

11303249,1,t1_dfcqlze,Its not just cause she is a woman of course if you go to Dank Memes you will find edgy teenagers calling her a whale and being pretty unfunny but Amy has created lots of controversy.The time she allegedly raped a friend cant find if its true.When she joked about the death of Ryan Dunn and never apologized.In red carpets she screams to Bradley Cooper and talked about fantasies with him or other famous people consider the double standards if a man did the same what would happen? That can upset some people.She is accused of stealing jokes.The whole women are funny movement again Amy is a bad representative because her humor doesnt appeal to the typical man combine that with the shitty attitude and trolls and you have drama ensured.Her humor can be pretty bad and you can like it but its not smart or good a lot of times enjoymentquality and reddit is not the audience for her shows.Her attitude is kinda shitty sometimes and while is her character to be mean dumb and obnoxious you gotta understand people not liking her.Dont believe when people say reddit hates woman like I said edgy teenagers do but there is more than it Im sure I left some that you can find below.Edit TLDR Amy doesnt appeal to the typical redditor and all the controversy and shitty attitude while in character can sometimes pass the line the way reddit works if you upset people more than once theres gonna be a circlejerk and she gained bad reputation because of this.,circlebroke,dfd7g0z,-1,t5_2tnz9
